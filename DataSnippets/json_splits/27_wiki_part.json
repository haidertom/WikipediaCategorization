These, in turn, come from [[Latin]] ''Vasco'' (pronounced {{IPA|/wasko/}}), plural ''[[Vascones]]'' (see History section below). The Latin [[labial-velar approximant]] /w/ generally [[betacism|evolved into]] the [[bilabial]]s /b/ and /\u03b2\u031e/ in Gascon and Spanish, probably under the influence of Basque and [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]], a language related to old Basque and spoken in [[Gascony]] in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] (similarly the Latin /w/ evolved into /v/ in [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and other languages).\n\nSeveral coins from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC found in the Basque Country bear the inscription ''barscunes''. The place where they were minted is not certain, but is thought to be somewhere near [[Pamplona]], in the heartland of the area that historians believe was inhabited by the ''Vascones''. Some scholars have suggested a Celtic etymology based on ''bhar-s-'', meaning \"summit\", \"point\" or \"leaves\", according to which ''barscunes'' may have meant \"the mountain people\", \"the tall ones\" or \"the proud ones\", while others have posited a relationship to a [[proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] root ''*bar-'' meaning \"border\", \"frontier\", \"march\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/130014?idi=en&clave=130014&op=4&primR=1&regs=10&EIKVOGEN=Barscunes&pos=4&epi=120849#mrc1 |title=Vascones - el nombre (Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia) |publisher=Euskomedia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nIn Basque, people call themselves the ''euskaldunak'', singular ''euskaldun'', formed from ''euskal-'' (i.e. \"Basque (language)\") and ''-dun'' (i.e. \"one who has\"); ''euskaldun'' literally means a Basque speaker. Not all Basques are Basque-speakers. Therefore, the [[neologism]] ''euskotar'', plural ''euskotarrak'', was coined in the 19th century to mean a culturally Basque person, whether Basque-speaking or not. Alfonso Irigoyen posits that the word ''euskara'' is derived from an ancient Basque verb ''enautsi'' \"to say\" (cf. modern Basque ''esan'') and the suffix ''-(k)ara'' (\"way (of doing something)\"). Thus ''euskara'' would literally mean \"way of saying\", \"way of speaking\". One item of evidence in favour of this hypothesis is found in the Spanish book ''Compendio Historial'', written in 1571 by the Basque writer [[Esteban de Garibay]]. He records the name of the Basque language as ''enusquera''. It may, however, be a writing mistake.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Basque nationalist activist [[Sabino Arana]] posited an original root ''euzko'' which, he thought, came from ''eguzkiko'' (\"of the sun\", related to the assumption of an original [[Solar deity|solar religion]]). On the basis of this putative root, Arana proposed the name [[Basque Country (greater region)|Euzkadi]] for an independent Basque nation, composed of seven Basque historical territories. Arana's neologism ''Euzkadi'' (in the regularized spelling Euskadi) is still widely used in both Basque and Spanish, since it is now the official name of the [[Autonomous Community]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of the Basque people|Origin of the Basques|Basque Country (greater region)#History}}\n[[File:Bayonne - Arriv\u00e9e des marchandes de sardines - Fonds Ancely - (cropped).jpg|thumb|Basque women in [[Bayonne]]]]\n[[File:Pamplona - Monumento a los Fueros 12.JPG|thumb|upright|Monument to the [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|Charters]] in Pamplona (1903)]]\n[[File:Ulgor.jpg|thumb|Ulgor, earliest nucleus of the cooperative movement and [[Mondragon Corporation|MCC]] (1956)]]\n\nSince the Basque language is unrelated to Indo-European, it has long been thought to represent the people or culture that occupied Europe before the spread of Indo-European languages there. A comprehensive analysis of Basque genetic patterns has shown that Basque genetic uniqueness predates the [[Neolithic Revolution|arrival of agriculture]] in the Iberian Peninsula, about 7,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal\n|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics\n|title=The Basque Paradigm: Genetic Evidence of a Maternal Continuity in the Franco-Cantabrian region since Pre-Neolithic Times\n|url=http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297%2812%2900032-8\n|volume=90\n|pages=486\u2013493\n|date= March 9, 2012\n|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.01.002\n|issue=3\n|pmid=22365151\n|pmc=3309182\n | last1 = Behar | first1 = DM | last2 = Harmant | first2 = C | last3 = Manry | first3 = J | last4 = van Oven | first4 = M | last5 = Haak | first5 = W | last6 = Martinez-Cruz | first6 = B | last7 = Salaberria | first7 = J | last8 = Oyhar\u00e7abal | first8 = B | last9 = Bauduer | first9 = F | last10 = Comas | first10 = D | last11 = Quintana-Murci | first11 = L}}</ref> It is thought that Basques are a remnant of the early inhabitants of Western Europe, specifically those of the [[Franco-Cantabrian region]]. Basque tribes were already mentioned in Roman times by Strabo and Pliny, including the [[Vascones]], [[Novempopulania|the Aquitani]], and others. There is enough evidence to support the hypothesis that at that time and later they spoke old varieties of the Basque language (see: [[Aquitanian language]]).\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages the territory between the [[Ebro]] and [[Garonne]] rivers was known as [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], a vaguely defined ethnic area and political entity struggling to fend off pressure from the Iberian [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Arab rule to the south]], as well as the [[Franks|Frankish]] push from the north.<ref>{{cite book | author = Trask, R.L.| year = 1997 | title= The History of Basque | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lbLbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA14 | location=New York, USA | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-13116-2 | page = 12}}</ref><ref name=\"Lewis AR 20-33\">{{cite book |title=\nThe Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718-1050|last=Lewis |first=Archibald R.|authorlink= Archibald Ross Lewis|year= 1965 |publisher= The University of Texas Press |location=|isbn= |pages=20\u201333|accessdate=2017-10-28|url=http://libro.uca.edu/lewis/sfcatsoc.htm}}</ref> By the turn of the first millennium, the territory of [[Gascony|Vasconia]] had fragmented into different feudal regions, such as [[Soule]] and [[Labourd]], while south of the Pyrenees the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Pamplona|Pamplona]] and the Pyrenean counties of [[County of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Sobrarbe]], [[Ribagorza]] (later [[Kingdom of Aragon]]), and [[County of Pallars|Pallars]] emerged as the main regional entities with Basque population in the 9th and 10th centuries.\n\nThe Kingdom of Pamplona, a central Basque realm, later known as [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], underwent a process of feudalization and was subject to the influence of its much larger Aragonese, Castilian and French neighbours. Castile deprived Navarre of its coastline by conquering [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|key western territories]] (1199\u20131201), leaving the kingdom landlocked. The Basques were ravaged by the [[War of the Bands]], bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. Weakened by the Navarrese civil war, the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|bulk of the realm eventually fell]] before the onslaught of the Spanish armies (1512\u20131524). However, [[Lower Navarre|the Navarrese territory north of the Pyrenees]] remained beyond the reach of an increasingly powerful Spain. [[Lower Navarre]] became a province of France in 1620.\n\nNevertheless, the Basques enjoyed a great deal of self-government [[End of Basque home rule in France|until the French Revolution (1790)]] and the [[Carlist Wars]] (1839, 1876), when the Basques supported heir apparent [[Infante Carlos of Spain, Count of Molina|Carlos V]] and his descendants. On either side of the Pyrenees, the Basques [[End of Basque home rule in Spain|lost their native institutions and laws]] held during the ''[[Ancien r\u00e9gime]]''. Since then, despite the current limited self-governing status of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and Navarre as settled by the Spanish Constitution, many Basques have attempted higher degrees of self-empowerment (see [[Basque nationalism]]), sometimes by acts of violence. [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]], and [[Soule]] were integrated into the [[Departments of France|French department system]] (starting 1790), with Basque efforts to establish a region-specific political-administrative entity failing to take off to date. However, in January 2017, a single agglomaration community was established for the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country in France]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Garicoix |first=Michel |date=2017-12-29|title=Le Pays basque se constitue en communaut\u00e9 d\u2019agglom\u00e9ration|trans-title=The Basque Country is established as a agglomeration community|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/12/29/le-pays-basque-se-constitue-en-communaute-d-agglomeration_5055172_823448.html |language=French |work= |location= |access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Political and administrative divisions===\n[[File:Ekialderantz Urkulutik.JPG|thumb|Mountains of the Basque Country]]\n[[File:Leitza.JPG|thumb|[[Leitza]], in Navarre, Basque Country]]\nThe Basque region is divided into at least three administrative units, namely the [[Basque Autonomous Community]] and [[Navarre]] in Spain, and the [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissement]] of [[Bayonne]] and the [[cantons of France|cantons]] of [[Maul\u00e9on-Licharre]] and [[Tardets-Sorholus]] in the ''[[d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Atlantiques]], France.\n\nThe autonomous community (a concept established in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]) known as ''Euskal Autonomia Erkidegoa'' or EAE in Basque and as ''Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma Vasca'' or CAV in Spanish (in English: ''Basque Autonomous Community'' or BAC),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.euskadi.net/euskalterm/ |title=See EUSKALTERM, the Basque Public Term Bank, maintained by the Basque Government for these and other terms and their common translations |publisher=.euskadi.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510193253/http://www1.euskadi.net/euskalterm/ |archivedate=May 10, 2010 }}</ref> is made up of the three Spanish provinces of [[\u00c1lava]], [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]]. The corresponding Basque names of these territories are ''Araba'', ''Bizkaia'' and ''Gipuzkoa'', and their Spanish names are ''\u00c1lava'', ''Vizcaya'' and ''Guip\u00fazcoa''.\n\nThe BAC only includes three of the seven provinces of the currently called historical territories. It is sometimes referred to simply as \"the Basque Country\" (or ''Euskadi'') by writers and public agencies only considering those three western provinces, but also on occasions merely as a convenient abbreviation when this does not lead to confusion in the context. Others reject this usage as inaccurate and are careful to specify the BAC (or an equivalent expression such as \"the three provinces\", up to 1978 referred to as \"Provincias Vascongadas\" in Spanish) when referring to this entity or region. Likewise, terms such as \"the Basque Government\" for \"the government of the BAC\" are commonly though not universally employed. In particular in common usage the French term ''Pays Basque'' (\"Basque Country\"), in the absence of further qualification, refers either to the whole [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] (\"Euskal Herria\" in Basque), or not infrequently to the [[Northern Basque Country|northern (or \"French\") Basque Country]] specifically.\n\nUnder Spain's present constitution, Navarre (''Nafarroa'' in present-day Basque, ''Navarra'' historically in Spanish) constitutes a separate entity, called in present-day Basque ''Nafarroako Foru Erkidegoa'', in Spanish ''Comunidad Foral de Navarra'' (the autonomous community of Navarre). The government of this autonomous community is the Government of Navarre. Note that in historical contexts Navarre may refer to a wider area, and that the present-day northern Basque province of [[Lower Navarre]] may also be referred to as (part of) ''Nafarroa'', while the term \"High Navarre\" (''Nafarroa Garaia'' in Basque, ''Alta Navarra'' in Spanish) is also encountered as a way of referring to the territory of the present-day autonomous community.\n\nThere are three other historic provinces parts of the Basque Country: [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]] and [[Soule]] (''Lapurdi, Nafarroa Beherea'' and ''Zuberoa'' in Basque; ''Labourd, Basse-Navarre'' and ''Soule'' in French), devoid of official status within France's present-day political and administrative territorial organization, and only minor political support to the Basque nationalists. A large number of regional and local nationalist and non-nationalist representatives have waged a campaign for years advocating for the creation of a separate Basque [[d\u00e9partement]], while these demands have gone unheard by the French administration.\n\n===Population, main cities and languages===\n[[File:Olentzero, Beasain.jpg|thumb|[[Olentzero]] in [[Gipuzkoa]], Basque Country]]\nThere are 2,123,000 people living in the Basque Autonomous Community (279,000 in Alava, 1,160,000 in Biscay and 684,000 in Gipuzkoa). The most important cities in this region, which serve as the provinces' administrative centers, are [[Bilbao]] (in Biscay), [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] (in Gipuzkoa) and [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] (in \u00c1lava). The official languages are Basque and Spanish. Knowledge of Spanish is compulsory under the Spanish constitution (article no. 3), and knowledge and usage of Basque is a right under the Statute of Autonomy (article no. 6), so only knowledge of Spanish is virtually universal. Knowledge of Basque, after declining for many years during [[Spain under Franco|Franco's dictatorship]] owing to official persecution, is again on the rise due to favorable official language policies and popular support. Currently about 33 percent of the population in the Basque Autonomous Community speaks Basque.\n\nNavarre has a population of 601,000; its administrative capital and main city, also regarded by many nationalist Basques as the Basques' historical capital, is Pamplona (''Iru\u00f1ea'' in modern Basque). Only Spanish is an official language of Navarre, and the Basque language is only co-official in the province's northern region, where most Basque-speaking Navarrese are concentrated.\n\nAbout a quarter of a million people live in the [[French Basque Country]]. Nowadays Basque-speakers refer to this region as ''Iparralde'' (Basque for North), and to the Spanish provinces as ''Hegoalde'' (South). Much of this population lives in or near the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz (BAB) urban belt on the coast (in Basque these are ''Baiona'', ''Angelu'' and ''Miarritze''). The Basque language, which was traditionally spoken by most of the region's population outside the BAB urban zone, is today rapidly losing ground to French. The French Basque Country's lack of self-government within the French state is coupled with the absence of official status for the Basque language in the region. Attempts to introduce bilingualism in local administration have so far met direct refusal from French officials.\n\n==Basque diaspora==\n{{Main article|Basque diaspora}}\n[[File:Basque festival in Buenos Aires August 2011.jpg|thumb|Basque festival in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina]]\n[[File:Winnemucca Basque Festival.jpg|thumb|right|Basque festival in [[Winnemucca, Nevada]]]]\nLarge numbers of Basques have left the Basque Country to settle in the rest of Spain, France or other parts of the world in different historical periods, often for economic or political reasons. Historically the Basques abroad were often employed in shepherding and ranching and by maritime fisheries and merchants. Millions of Basque descendants (see [[Basque American]] and [[Basque Canadian]]) live in North America (the United States; Canada, mainly in the provinces of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Quebec]]), Latin America (in all 23 countries), South Africa, and Australia.\n\n[[Miguel de Unamuno]] said: \"There are at least two things that clearly can be attributed to Basques: the [[Society of Jesus]] and the [[Republic of Chile]].\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Pedro|last=La\u00edn Entralgo|authorlink=Pedro La\u00edn Entralgo|url=http://www.filosofia.org/hem/194/alf/ez2302a.htm|title=Chile al trasluz|trans-title=Chile held up to the light|language=es|publisher=Filosofia.org|date=January 1949|accessdate=2 November 2016|quote='La Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas y la Rep\u00fablica de Chile son las dos grandes haza\u00f1as del pueblo vascongado', sol\u00eda decir don Miguel de Unamuno...

It is estimated that nearly 2,500,000 persons from all Antioquia (40% of this [[Departments of Colombia|department]]) have Basque ancestry, as well, in the 19th century about 10% of Colombia's total population were Basque descendants.<ref>http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/riev/32/32443444.pdf</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2016}} Antioquia has one of the biggest concentrations of Basques descendants around the world.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In 1955, Joaqu\u00edn Ospina said: \"Is there something more similar to the Basque people than the \"''antioque\u00f1os''\".<ref>http://www.lehendakaritza.ejgv.euskadi.eus/r48-contcvpv/en/contenidos/informacion/03_andres_irujo/en_airujo/adjuntos/antioquia.pdf</ref> Also, writer Arturo Escobar Uribe said in his book \"''Mitos de Antioquia''\" (Myths of Antioquia) (1950): \"Antioquia, which in its clean ascendance predominates the peninsular farmer of the Basque provinces, inherited the virtues of its ancestors...

[[Reno, Nevada]], where the Center for Basque Studies and the Basque Studies Library are located at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]], is another significant nucleus of Basque population. [[Elko, Nevada]] sponsors an annual Basque festival that celebrates the dance, cuisine and cultures of the Basque peoples of Spanish, French and Mexican nationalities who have arrived in [[Nevada]] since the late 19th century.\n\n[[Texas]] has a large percentage of Hispanics descended from Basques who participated in the conquest of [[New Spain]]. Many of the original [[Tejano]]s had Basque blood, including those who fought in the [[Battle of the Alamo]] alongside many of the other Texans. Along the Mexican/Texan border, many Basque surnames can be found. The largest concentration of Basques who settled on Mexico's north-eastern \"frontera\", including the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Durango]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], and [[Tamaulipas]], also settled along Texas' [[Rio Grande River]] from [[South Texas]] to [[West Texas]]. Many of the historic ''hidalgos'', or noble families from this area, had gained their titles and land grants from Spain and Mexico; they still value their land. Some of North America's largest ranches, which were founded under these colonial land grants, can be found in this region.\n\n[[California]] has a major concentration of Basques, most notably in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] between [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]. The city of Bakersfield has a large Basque community and the city has several Basque restaurants, including Noriega's which won the 2011 James Beard Foundation America's Classic Award. There is a history of Basque culture in [[Chino, California]]. In Chino, two annual Basque festivals celebrate the dance, cuisine, and culture of the peoples. The surrounding area of [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] has many Basque descendants as residents. They are mostly descendants of settlers from Spain and Mexico. These Basques in California are grouped in the group known as ''[[Californio]]s''.\n\nBasques of European Spanish-French and Latin American nationalities also settled throughout the western U.S. in states like [[Louisiana]], [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\n==Culture==\n{{Basque culture}}\n[[File:Lingue vasconum primitiae.gif|thumb|Cover of the first Basque language book, written by Bernard Etxepare]]\n[[File:Nortasun.png|Classification of population according to cultural identity|thumb|Cultural identity according to the 1981 and 1991 census based on the question ''Do you consider yourself Basque?'' &nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;-&nbsp;Yes<br>2&nbsp;-&nbsp;Yes, in some ways &nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;-&nbsp;No<br>4&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don't know / Don't answer]]\n\n===Language===\n{{Main article|Basque language}}\nThe identifying language of the Basques is called Basque or ''Euskara'', spoken today by 25%-30%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eke.org/euskara/soziolinguistika|title=Sociolinguistics|publisher=Eke.org|date=|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> of the region's population. An idea of the central place of the cultural terms in Basque nationalist politicians is given by the fact that, in Basque, Basques identify themselves by the term ''euskaldun'' and their country as ''Euskal Herria'', literally \"Basque speaker\" and \"Country of the Basque Language\" respectively. The language has been made a political issue by official Spanish and French policies restricting its use either historically or currently; however, this has not stopped the teaching, speaking, writing, and cultivating of this increasingly vibrant minority language. This sense of Basque identity tied to the local language does not exist in isolation. It is juxtaposed with an equally strong sense of national identity tied with the use of the Spanish and [[French language]]s among other Basques. As with many European states, a regional identity, be it linguistically derived or otherwise, is not mutually exclusive with the broader national one. For example, Basque [[France national rugby union team|rugby union]] player for France, [[Imanol Harinordoquy]], has said about his national identity:<blockquote>I am French and Basque. There is no conflict, I am proud of both. . . . I have friends who are involved in the political side of things but that is not for me. My only interest is the culture, the Euskera language, the people, our history and ways.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/france/2431544/France-look-to-Basque-prodigy.html |title=France look to Basque prodigy |first=Brendan |last=Gallagher |work=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |date=27 February 2002 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of state language promotion, school policies, the effects of mass media and migration, today virtually all Basques (except for some children below school age) speak the official language of their state (Spanish or French). There are extremely few Basque monolingual speakers: essentially all Basque speakers are bilingual on both sides of the border. Spanish or French is typically the first language of citizens from other regions (who often feel no need to learn Basque), and Spanish or French is also the first language of many Basques, all of which maintains the dominance of the state tongues of both France and Spain. Recent Basque Government policies aim to change this pattern, as they are viewed as potential threats against mainstream usage of the minority tongue.<ref>{{cite web|first=Xabier|last=Aierdi Urraza|url=http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07/en_integraz/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07.html|title=Routes to linguistic and cultural integration for immigrants in the Basque Autonomous Community|publisher=euskara.euskadi.net|date=24 July 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302214808/http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07/en_integraz/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07.html|archivedate=2 March 2007|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe Basque language is thought to be a [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] [[language isolate]] in contrast with other European languages, almost all of which belong to the broad [[Indo-European language family]].

Basque is also a modern language, and is established as a written and printed one used in present-day forms of publication and communication, as well as a language spoken and used in a very wide range of social and cultural contexts, styles, and registers.\n\n===Land and inheritance===\n[[File:ArangurenDorretxea.jpg|thumb|right|The Aranguren baserri in [[Orozko]], converted from a fortified tower]]\n[[File:BaserriLizarralde.jpg|thumb|right|The Lizarralde baserri ([[Bergara]])]]\nBasques have a close attachment to their home (''etxe(a)'' 'house, home'), especially when this consists of the traditional self-sufficient, family-run farm or ''[[baserri]](a)''. Home in this context is synonymous with family roots. Some [[Basque surnames]] were adapted from old ''baserri'' or [[habitation name]]s. They typically related to a geographical orientation or other locally meaningful identifying features. Such surnames provide even those Basques whose families may have left the land generations ago with an important link to their rural family origins: ''Bengoetxea'' \"the house of further down\", ''Goikoetxea'' \"the house above\", ''Landaburu'' \"top of the field\", ''Errekondo'' \"next to the stream\", ''Elizalde'' \"by the church\", ''Mendizabal'' \"wide hill\", ''Usetxe'' \"house of birds\" ''Ibarretxe'' \"house in the valley\", ''Etxeberria'' \"the new house\", and so on.<ref>[[Koldo Mitxelena|MITXELENA, Koldo]], ''Apellidos vascos'' (fifth edition), San Sebasti\u00e1n: Txertoa, 1997.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to surrounding regions, ancient Basque inheritance patterns, recognised in the ''[[fueros]],'' favoured survival of the unity of inherited land holdings. In a kind of primogeniture, these usually were inherited by either the eldest male or female. As in other cultures, the fate of other family members depended on the assets of a family: wealthy Basque families tended to provide for all children in some way, while less-affluent may have had only one asset to provide to one child. However, this heir often provided for the rest of the family (unlike in England, with strict primogeniture, where the eldest son inherited everything and often did not provide for others). Even though they were provided for in some way, younger siblings had to make much of their living by other means. Before the advent of industrialisation, this system resulted in the emigration of many rural Basques to Spain, France or the Americas. Harsh by modern standards, this custom resulted in a great many enterprising figures of Basque origin who went into the world to earn their way, from Spanish [[conquistador]]s such as [[Lope de Aguirre]] and Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado, to explorers, missionaries and saints of the Catholic Church, such as [[Francis Xavier]].\n\nA widespread belief that Basque society was originally [[matriarchal]] is at odds with the current, clearly [[patrilineal]] kinship system and inheritance structures. Some scholars and commentators have attempted to reconcile these points by assuming that patrilineal kinship represents an innovation. In any case, the social position of women in both traditional and modern Basque society is somewhat better than in neighbouring cultures, and women have a substantial influence in decisions about the domestic economy. In the past, some women participated in collective magical ceremonies. They were key participants in a rich folklore, today largely forgotten.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main article|Basque cuisine}}\n[[Basque cuisine]] is at the heart of Basque culture, influenced by the neighboring communities and the excellent produce from the sea and the land. A 20th-century feature of Basque culture is the phenomenon of [[gastronomical society|gastronomical societies]] (called ''[[txoko]]'' in Basque), food clubs where men gather to cook and enjoy their own food. Until recently, women were allowed entry only one day in the year. Cider houses ([[Sagardotegi]]ak) are popular restaurants in Gipuzkoa open for a few months while the cider is in season.\n\n===Cultural production===\n[[File:Artzaiak inudeak 2009 001.jpg|thumb|Artzaiak eta inudeak festival, [[Donostia]], Basque Country.]]\nAt the end of the 20th century, despite [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] violence (ended in 2010) and the crisis of heavy industries, the Basque economic condition recovered remarkably. They emerged from the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime with a revitalized language and culture. The Basque language expanded geographically led by large increases in the major urban centers of Pamplona, Bilbao, and Bayonne, where only a few decades ago the Basque language had all but disappeared. Nowadays, the number of Basque speakers is maintaining its level or increasing slightly.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main article|Basque music}}\n[[File:Basque dance.JPG|thumb|Basque dance]]\n\n===Religion===\nTraditionally Basques have been mostly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. In the 19th century and well into the 20th, Basques as a group remained notably devout and churchgoing. In recent years church attendance has fallen off, as in most of Western Europe. The region has been a source of missionaries like [[Francis Xavier]] and [[Michel Garico\u00efts]]. [[Ignatius Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus]], was a Basque. [[California]] [[Franciscan]] [[Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n]] was born in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]]. Lasu\u00e9n was the successor to Franciscan Padre [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] and founded 9 of the 21 extant [[California Missions]] along the coast.\n\nA sprout of [[Protestantism]] in the continental Basque Country produced the first translation of the new Testament into Basque by [[Joanes Leizarraga]]. Queen [[Jeanne III of Navarre]], a devout [[Huguenot]], commissioned the translation of the New Testament into Basque and B\u00e9arnese for the benefit of her subjects. By the time [[Henry IV of France|Henry III of Navarre]] converted to Roman Catholicism in order to become king of France, Protestantism virtually disappeared from the Basque community.\n\n[[Bayonne]] held a Jewish community composed mainly of [[Sephardi Jews]] fleeing from the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s. There were also important Jewish and [[Muslim]] communities in [[Navarre]] before the Castilian invasion of 1512-21.\n\nNowadays, according to one single opinion poll, only slightly more than 50% of Basques profess some kind of belief in [[God]], while the rest are either [[agnostic]] or [[atheist]]. The number of religious skeptics increases noticeably for the younger generations, while the older ones are more religious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.com/argazki/forum_re/caracterizacion.pdf|title=Opinion poll on religion by GIZAKER|publisher=[[EITB]] the Basque Country's public broadcast service.|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=2010-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qYGtTnn7?url=http://www.eitb.com/argazki/forum_re/caracterizacion.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-17|df=}}</ref>\n[[Roman Catholicism]] is, by far, the largest religion in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].

There are broadly speaking two views. According to one, Christianity arrived in the Basque Country during the 4th and 5th centuries but according to the other, it did not take place until the 12th and 13th centuries. The main issue lies in the different interpretations of what is considered Christianisation. Early traces of Christianity can be found in the major urban areas from the 4th century onwards, a bishopric from 589 in Pamplona and three hermit cave concentrations (two in \u00c1lava, one in Navarre) were in use from the 6th century onwards. In this sense, Christianity arrived \"early\".\n\nPre-Christian belief seems to have focused on a goddess called [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]]. A number of place-names contain her name and would suggest these places were related to worship of her such as ''[[Anbotoko Mari]]'' who appears to have been related to the weather. According to one tradition, she travelled every seven years between a cave on Mount [[Anboto]] and one on another mountain (the stories vary); the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, dry when she was in [[Alo\u00f1a]], or [[Supelegor]], or [[Gorbea]]. One of her names, ''Mari Urraca'' possibly ties her to an historical Navarrese princess of the 11th and 12th century, with other legends giving her a brother or cousin who was a Roman Catholic priest. So far the discussions about whether the name Mari is original and just happened to coincide closely with the Christian name Mar\u00eda or if Mari is an early Basque attempt to give a Christian veneer to pagan worship have remained speculative. At any rate, Mari (Andramari) is one of the oldest worshipped Christian icons in Basque territories.\n\nMari's consort is [[Sugaar]]. This [[chthonic]] couple seem to bear the superior ethical power and also the power of creation and destruction. It's said that when they gathered in the high caves of the sacred peaks, they engendered the storms. These meetings typically happened on Friday nights, the day of historical [[Akelarre (witchcraft)|akelarre]] or [[coven]]. Mari was said to reside in Mount [[Anboto]]; periodically she crossed the skies as a bright light to reach her other home at mount [[Txindoki]].\n\nLegends also speak of many and abundant genies, like ''[[jentilak]]'' (equivalent to [[giant (mythology)|giants]]), ''lamiak'' (equivalent to [[nymph]]s), ''[[mairu]]ak'' (builders of the cromlechs or stone circles, literally [[Moors]]), ''iratxoak'' ([[imp]]s), ''[[sorginak]]'' ([[witch]]es, priestess of Mari), and so on. [[Basajaun]] is a Basque version of the [[Woodwose]]. This character is probably an anthropomorphism of the bear. There is a [[trickster]] named ''[[San Martin Txiki]]'' (\"St Martin the Lesser\").\n\nIt has been shown that some of these stories have entered Basque culture in recent centuries or as part of Roman ''[[superstition]]''. It is unclear whether [[neolithic]] stone structures called [[dolmen]]s have a religious significance or were built to house animals or resting shepherds. Some of the dolmens and [[Stone circles|cromlechs]] are burial sites serving as well as border markers.\n[[File:Ioaldunak 001.jpg|thumb|''Ioaldunak'' dancers of Navarre.]]\nThe ''jentilak'' ('[[Giant (mythology)|Giants]]'), on the other hand, are a legendary people which explains the disappearance of a people of [[Stone Age]] culture that used to live in the high lands and with no knowledge of the iron. Many legends about them tell that they were bigger and taller, with a great force, but were displaced by the ''ferrons'', or workers of ironworks foundries, until their total fade-out. They were pagans, but one of them, [[Olentzero]], accepted Christianity and became a sort of Basque [[Santa Claus]]. They gave name to several toponyms, as ''[[Jentilbaratza]]''.\n[[File:Weiditz Trachtenbuch 125-126.jpg|thumb|Senior Basque women during the 16th century; the attire was forbidden on [[Pierre de Lancre]]'s intervention in the Basque Country (1609-1612)]]\n\n===Society===\nHistorically, Basque society can be described as being somewhat at odds with Roman and later European societal norms.\n\n[[Strabo]]'s account of the north of Spain in his ''[[Geographica]]'' (written between approximately 20 BC and 20 AD) makes a mention of \"a sort of woman-rule\u2014not at all a mark of civilization\" (Hadington 1992), a first mention of the\u2014for the period\u2014unusual position of women. \"Women could inherit and control property as well as officiate in churches. Combined with the issue of lingering pagan beliefs, this enraged the leaders of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], perhaps leading to [[Logro\u00f1o trials|one of the largest witch hunts]] in the Basque town of [[Logro\u00f1o]] in 1610\".<ref name=\"Hadingham\">Hadingham 1992. Note that [[Logro\u00f1o]] is not a Basque town, but it was the see of the [[diocese|diocesis]] covering [[Zugarramurdi]] in 1610. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] rarely acted against witches, devoting most of its attention to [[Judaizers]], [[Morisco]]s and Protestants.</ref>\n\nThis preference for female dominance existed well into the 20th century:\n<blockquote>...[[matrilineal]] inheritance laws, and agricultural work performed by women continued in Basque country until the early twentieth century. For more than a century, scholars have widely discussed the high status of Basque women in law codes, as well as their positions as judges, inheritors, and arbitrators through ante-Roman, medieval, and modern times. The system of laws governing succession in the French Basque region reflected total equality between the sexes. Up until the eve of the French Revolution, the Basque woman was truly \u2018the mistress of the house', hereditary guardian, and head of the lineage.<ref name=\"treilo\">Gimbutas, M. ''The Living Goddesses'' University of California Press: 2001</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough the [[kingdom of Navarre]] did adopt feudalism, most Basques also possessed unusual social institutions different from those of the rest of feudal Europe. Some aspects of this include the [[elizate]] tradition where local house-owners met in front of the church to elect a representative to send to the ''juntas'' and ''[[Juntas Generales]]'' (such as the ''Juntas Generales de Vizcaya'' or ''Guip\u00fazcoa'') which administered much larger areas. Another example was the fact that in the medieval period most land was owned by the farmers, not the Church or a king.<ref name=\"Trask1997\"/>{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}<ref name=\"oprmay\">Collins, R.

In the 2016-2017 season these five clubs played together in La Liga, the first instance where five Basque clubs have reached that level at the same time.

It refers back to the kingdom status of Navarre (up to 1841) and their traditional institutional and legal framework ([[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|charters]]). Basque, the original and main language of Navarre up to the late 18th century, has kept family transmission especially in the northern part of Navarre and central areas to a lesser extent, designated as Basque speaking or mixed area in Navarrese law. Questions of political, linguistic and cultural allegiance and identity are highly complex in Navarre. Politically some Basque nationalists would like to integrate with the Basque Autonomous Community.\n\nThe [[French Basque Country]] today does not exist as a formal political entity and is officially simply part of the French [[department (country subdivision)|department]] of [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Atlantiques]], centered in [[B\u00e9arn]]. In recent years the number of mayors of the region supporting the creation of a separate Basque department has grown to 63.87%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maire-info.com/territoires/departements/64-des-maires-basques-favorables-un-departement-pays-basque-article-6264 |title=64% des maires basques favorables \u00e0 un d\u00e9partement Pays Basque |date=2 Nov 2005 |work= |publisher=Maire-info.com |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> So far, their attempts have been unsuccessful.\n\n==Political conflicts==\n\n===Language===\n{{Main article|Basque language}}\n{{See also|Basque Country (greater region)#Language}}\n\nBoth the Spanish and French governments have, at times, suppressed Basque [[natural language|linguistic]] and cultural identity. The [[French Republics (disambiguation)|French Republics]], the epitome of the [[nation-state]], have a long history of attempting the complete cultural absorption of cultural minority groups. Spain has, at most points in its history, granted some degree of linguistic, cultural, and even political autonomy to its Basques, but under the [[Spain under Franco|regime of Francisco Franco]], the Spanish government reversed the advances of Basque nationalism, as it had fought in the opposite side of the [[Spanish Civil War]]: cultural activity in Basque was limited to folkloric issues and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nToday, the [[Southern Basque Country]] within Spain enjoys an extensive cultural and political autonomy. The majority of schools under the jurisdiction of the [[Basque education system]] use Basque as the primary medium of teaching. However, the situation is more delicate in the [[French Basque Country|Northern Basque Country]] within France, where Basque is not officially recognized, and where lack of autonomy and monolingual public schooling in French exert great pressure on the Basque language.\n\nIn Navarre, Basque has been declared an endangered language, since the anti-Basque and conservative government of [[Navarrese People's Union]] opposes the symbols of Basque culture,<ref>Resolution of the General Assembly of the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages, 13 September 2003 (Helsinki), on the situation of the Basque language in the Autonomous Community of Navarre.

Within the Basque country, this element of Basque politics is often in balance with the conception of the Basque Country as just another part of the Spanish state, a view more commonly espoused on the right of the political spectrum. In contrast, the desire for greater autonomy or independence is particularly common among [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalists. The right of self-determination was asserted by the [[Basque Parliament]] in 2002 and 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/pp-and-pse-voted-against-basque-parliament-adopts-resolution-on-s?itemId=B24_18787&cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&idioma=en |title=EITB: ''Basque parliament adopts resolution on self-determination'' |publisher=Eitb24.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}</ref>\nSince self-determination is not recognized in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], a wide majority of Basques abstained (55%) and some even voted against it (23.5%) in the ratification referendum of December 6 of that year. However, it was approved by clear [[majority]] overall in Spanish (87%). The autonomous regime for the Basque Country was approved in a 1979 referendum but the autonomy of Navarre (''Amejoramiento del Fuero'': \"improvement of the charter\") was never subject to a referendum but only approved by the Navarrese Cortes (parliament).\n\n====Political violence====\n{{Main article|Basque conflict}}\n{{See also|ETA (separatist group)|Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci\u00f3n|Batall\u00f3n Vasco Espa\u00f1ol|Comandos Aut\u00f3nomos Anticapitalistas|Iraultza}}\n{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}\n\n==Classification==\nAs with their language, the Basques are clearly a distinct cultural group in their region.

Surrounded by [[Romance languages|Romance-language]] speakers, the Basques traditionally spoke (and many still speak) a language that was not only non-Romance but non-Indo-European. The prevailing belief amongst Basques, and forming part of their national identity, is that their language has continuity with the people who were in this region since not only pre-Roman and pre-Celtic times, but since the Stone Age.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:06_laiatzen.jpg|thumb|Basque peasants [[Laia (tool)|ploughing]]]]\nIn 1920, [[H.

There are several standard methods of bookkeeping, such as the [[single-entry bookkeeping system]] and the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]], but, while they may be thought of as \"real\" bookkeeping, any process that involves the recording of financial transactions is a bookkeeping process.\n\nBookkeeping is usually performed by a '''bookkeeper'''. A bookkeeper (or book-keeper) is a person who records the day-to-day financial transactions of a business. They are usually responsible for writing the ''daybooks'', which contain records of purchases, sales, receipts, and payments. The bookkeeper is responsible for ensuring that all transactions whether it is cash transaction or credit transaction are recorded in the correct daybook, supplier's ledger, customer ledger, and [[general ledger]]; an accountant can then create reports from the information concerning the financial transactions recorded by the bookkeeper.\n\nBookkeeping refers mainly to the record-keeping aspects of accounting. Bookkeeping involves preparing source documents for all transactions, operations, and other events of the business. \n\nThe bookkeeper brings the books to the [[trial balance]] stage: an accountant may prepare the [[income statement]] and [[balance sheet]] using the trial balance and ledgers prepared by the bookkeeper.\n\n== History ==\nThe origin of book-keeping is lost in obscurity, but recent researches would appear to show that some method of keeping accounts has existed from the remotest times. Babylonian records have been found dating back as far as 2600 B.C., written with a stylus on small slabs of clay.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Book-Keeping|volume=4|page=225}}</ref> \nThe term \"waste book\" was used in colonial America referring to bookkeeping. The purpose was to document daily transactions including receipts and expenditures. This was recorded in chronological order, and the purpose was for temporary use only. The daily transactions would then be recorded in a daybook or account ledger in order to balance the accounts. The name \"waste book\" comes from the fact that once the waste book's data were transferred to the actual journal, the waste book could be discarded.<ref>{{cite web | publisher= Guides to Archives and Manuscript Collections at the University of Pittsburgh Library System |title= Pittsburgh Waste Book and Fort Pitt Trading Post Papers |url= http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=General%20John%20Forbes;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-dar192503 |access-date= 2015-09-04 }}</ref>\n\n=== Process ===\nThe bookkeeping process primarily records the ''financial effects'' of transactions. The difference between a manual and any electronic accounting system results from the former's [[latency (engineering)]] between the recording of a financial transaction and its posting in the relevant account. This delay\u2014absent in electronic accounting systems due to nearly instantaneous posting into relevant accounts\u2014is a basic characteristic of manual systems, thus giving rise to primary books of accounts such as Cash Book, Bank Book, Purchase Book, and Sales Book for recording the immediate effect of a financial transaction.\n\nIn the normal course of business, a document is produced each time a transaction occurs. Sales and purchases usually have [[invoice]]s or [[receipt]]s. Deposit slips are produced when lodgements (deposits) are made to a [[bank account]]. Checks (spelled \"cheques\" in the UK and several other countries) are written to pay money out of the account. Bookkeeping first involves recording the details of all of these ''source documents'' into multi-column ''journals'' (also known as ''books of first entry'' or ''daybooks''). For example, all credit sales are recorded in the sales journal; all cash payments are recorded in the cash payments journal. Each column in a journal normally corresponds to an account. In the [[single-entry accounting system|single entry system]], each transaction is recorded only once. Most individuals who balance their check-book each month are using such a system, and most personal-finance software follows this approach.\n\nAfter a certain period, typically a month, each column in each [[Journal entry|journal]] is totalled to give a summary for that period. Using the rules of double-entry, these journal summaries are then transferred to their respective accounts in the [[ledger]], or ''account book''. For example, the entries in the Sales Journal are taken and a debit entry is made in each customer's account (showing that the customer now owes us money), and a credit entry might be made in the account for \"Sale of class 2 widgets\" (showing that this activity has generated revenue for us). This process of transferring summaries or individual transactions to the ledger is called  ''posting''. Once the posting process is complete, accounts kept using the \"T\" format undergo ''balancing'', which is simply a process to arrive at the balance of the account.\n\nAs a partial check that the posting process was done correctly, a working document called an ''unadjusted trial balance'' is created. In its simplest form, this is a three-column list. Column One contains the names of those accounts in the [[ledger]] which have a non-zero balance. If an account has a ''debit'' balance, the balance amount is copied into Column Two (the ''debit column''); if an account has a ''credit'' balance, the amount is copied into Column Three (the ''credit column''). The debit column is then totalled, and then the credit column is totalled. The two totals must agree\u2014which is not by chance\u2014because under the double-entry rules, whenever there is a posting, the debits of the posting equal the credits of the posting. If the two totals do not agree, an error has been made, either in the journals or during the posting process. The error must be located and rectified, and the totals of the debit column and the credit column recalculated to check for agreement before any further processing can take place.\n\nOnce the accounts balance, the accountant makes a number of adjustments and changes the balance amounts of some of the accounts. These adjustments must still obey the double-entry rule: for example, the ''[[inventory]]'' account and asset account might be changed to bring them into line with the actual numbers counted during a stocktake. At the same time, the ''expense'' account associated with usage of inventory is adjusted by an equal and opposite amount. Other adjustments such as posting [[depreciation]] and prepayments are also done at this time. This results in a listing called the ''adjusted trial balance''. It is the accounts in this list, and their corresponding debit or credit balances, that are used to prepare the financial statements.\n\nFinally [[financial statement]]s are drawn from the trial balance, which may include:\n* the [[income statement]], also known as the ''statement of financial results'', ''profit and loss account'', or ''P&L''\n* the [[balance sheet]], also known as the ''statement of financial position''\n* the [[cash flow statement]]\n* the [[Statement of changes in equity]], also known as the ''statement of total recognised gains and losses''\n\n== Entry systems ==\nTwo common bookkeeping systems used by businesses and other organizations are the [[single-entry bookkeeping system]] and the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]]. Single-entry bookkeeping uses only income and expense [[Account (accountancy)|account]]s, recorded primarily in a revenue and expense journal. Single-entry bookkeeping is adequate for many small businesses. In the double-entry accounting system, at least two accounting entries are required to record each financial transaction. These entries may occur in asset, liability, equity, expense, or revenue accounts.\n\n===Single-entry system===\n{{main article|single-entry bookkeeping system}}\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please remember that this is a summary of sedhf ksnvd  topic covered in the article on single-entry bookkeeping. -->\n\nThe primary bookkeeping record in single-entry bookkeeping is the ''cash book'', which is similar to a checking account (UK: cheque account, current account) register, but allocates the income and expenses to various income and expense accounts. Separate account records are maintained for petty cash, accounts payable and receivable, and other relevant transactions such as [[inventory]] and travel expenses. These days, single-entry bookkeeping can be done with [[DIY]] bookkeeping software to speed up manual calculations.\n\n===Double-entry system===\n{{main article|double-entry bookkeeping system}}\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please remember that this is a summary of the topic covered in the article on double-entry bookkeeping. -->\n\nA ''double-entry bookkeeping system'' is a set of rules for recording financial information in a [[financial accounting]] system in which every transaction or event changes at least two different nominal [[ledger]] accounts.\n\n==Daybooks==\nA ''daybook'' is a descriptive and chronological (diary-like) record of day-to-day [[financial transactions]] also called a ''book of original entry''. The daybook's details must be entered formally into journals to enable posting to ledgers. Daybooks include:\n\n*Sales daybook, for recording all the sales invoices.\n*Sales credits daybook, for recording all the sales credit notes.\n*Purchases daybook, for recording all the purchase invoices.\n*Purchases Debits daybook, for recording all the purchase Debit notes.\n*Cash daybook, usually known as the cash book, for recording all money received as well as money paid out. It may be split into two daybooks: receipts daybook for money received in, and payments daybook for money paid out.\n*General Journal daybook, for recording journals.\n\n==Petty cash book==\nA ''[[petty cash]]'' book is a record of small-value purchases before they are later transferred to the ledger and final accounts; it is maintained by a petty or junior cashier. This type of cash book usually uses the [[imprest system]]: a certain amount of money is provided to the petty cashier by the senior cashier. This money is to cater for minor expenditures (hospitality, minor stationery, casual postage, and so on) and is reimbursed periodically on satisfactory explanation of how it was spent.\n\n==Journals==\n''[[Journal entry|Journals]]'' are recorded in the general journal daybook. A journal is a formal and chronological record of [[financial transactions]] before their values are accounted for in the general ledger as [[debits and credits]]. A company can maintain one journal for all transactions, or keep several journals based on similar activity (e.g., sales, cash receipts, revenue, etc.), making transactions easier to summarize and reference later. For every [[debits and credits|debit]] journal entry recorded, there must be an equivalent [[debits and credits|credit]] journal entry to maintain a balanced accounting equation.<ref>{{cite book | last = Haber | first = Jeffry | title = Accounting Demystified | publisher = AMACOM | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8144-0790-0 | page = 15}}</ref>\n\n==Ledgers==\nA ''[[ledger]]'' is a record of [[Account (accountancy)|accounts]].The ledger is a permanent summary of all amounts entered in supporting Journals which list individual transactions by date. These accounts are recorded separately, showing their beginning/ending [[Balance (accounting)|balance]]. A journal lists [[financial transactions]] in chronological order, without showing their balance but showing how much is going to be charged in each account. A ledger takes each financial transaction from the journal and records it into the corresponding account for every transaction listed. The ledger also sums up the total of every account, which is transferred into the [[balance sheet]] and the [[income statement]]. There are three different kinds of ledgers that deal with book-keeping:\n*Sales ledger, which deals mostly with the accounts receivable account. This ledger consists of the records of the financial transactions made by customers to the business.\n*Purchase ledger is the record of the purchasing transactions a company does; it goes hand in hand with the Accounts Payable account.\n\n==Abbreviations used in bookkeeping==\n* A/C \u2013 Account\n* Acc \u2013 Account\n* A/R \u2013 Accounts receivable\n* A/P \u2013 Accounts payable\n* B/S \u2013 Balance sheet\n* c/d \u2013 Carried down\n* b/d \u2013 Brought down\n* c/f \u2013 Carried forward\n* b/f \u2013 Brought forward\n* Dr \u2013 Debit side of a ledger. \"Dr\" stands for \"'''D'''ebit '''r'''egister\"\n* Cr \u2013 Credit side of a ledger. \"Cr\" stands for \"'''C'''redit '''r'''egister\"\n* G/L \u2013 General ledger; (or N/L \u2013 nominal ledger)\n* PL \u2013 Profit and loss; (or I/S \u2013 income statement)\n* P/R - Payroll\n* PP&E \u2013 Property, plant and equipment\n* TB \u2013 Trial Balance\n* GST \u2013 [[Goods and Services Tax (disambiguation)|Goods and services tax]]\n* VAT \u2013 [[Value added tax]]\n* CST \u2013 Central sale tax\n* TDS \u2013 Tax deducted at source\n* AMT \u2013 Alternate minimum tax\n* EBITDA \u2013 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation\n* EBDTA \u2013 Earnings before depreciation, taxes and amortisation\n* EBT \u2013 Earnings before tax\n* EAT \u2013 Earnings after tax\n* PAT \u2013 Profit after tax\n* PBT \u2013 Profit before tax\n* Depr \u2013 Depreciation\n* Dep \u2013 Depreciation\n* CPO \u2013 Cash paid out\n* CP - Cash Payment\n*\n\n==Chart of accounts==\nA [[chart of accounts]] is a list of the [[Account (accountancy)|accounts]] codes that can be identified with numeric, alphabetical, or alphanumeric codes allowing the account to be located in the general ledger. The equity section of the chart of accounts is based on the fact that the legal structure of the entity is of a particular legal type. Possibilities include ''sole trader'', ''partnership'', ''trust'', and ''company''.<ref>Marsden,Stephen (2008). Australian Master Bookkeepers Guide. Sydney: CCH {{ISBN|978-1-921593-57-4}}</ref>\n\n==Computerized bookkeeping==\nComputerized bookkeeping removes many of the paper \"books\" that are used to record the financial transactions of an entity\u2014instead, relational databases take their place, but they still typically enforce the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]] and methodology. CPAs design the internal controls for the computerized bookkeeping system, which serve to minimize errors in documenting the big number of activities that the entity engages in over the period.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Accounting]]\n\n{{wikiquote}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.icas.com/education-and-qualifications/infographic-books-of-prime-entry-student-blog |title=Infographic: What are the Books of Prime Entry? |author=CA Student Blog |publisher=Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland |website=icas.com |date=27 April 2017 |access-date=16 June 2017}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Accounting systems]]\n[[Category:Accounting]]", "sha1": "qpo06ichcw7peys256pi18iuny3cyno"}}, {"title": "Basil the Great", "ns": "0", "id": "4663", "redirect": {"title": "Basil of Caesarea"}, "revision": {"id": "15902923", "parentid": "905594", "timestamp": "2003-05-10T08:07:22Z", "contributor": {"username": "Llywrch", "id": "5094"}, "comment": "redirect to consolidated article", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Basil of Caesarea]]", "sha1": "hd279i0ejfq4m7ib66d7wq87g8ste33"}}, {"title": "B\u00e9zier curve", "ns": "0", "id": "4664", "revision": {"id": "865389492", "parentid": "865385484", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T17:06:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "Citation bot", "id": "7903804"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Alter: issue, title.

When animators or [[Graphical user interface|interface]] designers talk about the \"physics\" or \"feel\" of an operation, they may be referring to the particular B\u00e9zier curve used to control the velocity over time of the move in question.\n\nThis also applies to robotics where the motion of a welding arm, for example, should be smooth to avoid unnecessary wear.\n\nThe mathematical basis for B\u00e9zier curves\u2014the [[Bernstein polynomial]]\u2014had been known since 1912, but the polynomials were not applied to graphics until some 50 years later,\nwhen they were widely publicised by the [[France|French]] engineer [[Pierre B\u00e9zier]], who used them to design [[automobile]] bodies at [[Renault]].  The study of these curves was however first developed in 1959 by mathematician [[Paul de Casteljau]] using [[de Casteljau's algorithm]], a [[numerical stability|numerically stable]] method to evaluate B\u00e9zier curves at [[Citro\u00ebn]], another French automaker.<ref name=\"FarinHoschek2002\">{{cite book |author1=Gerald E.

As the curve is completely contained in the [[convex hull]] of its [[Control point (mathematics)|control points]], the points can be graphically displayed and used to manipulate the curve intuitively. [[Affine transformation]]s such as [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] can be applied on the curve by applying the respective transform on the control points of the curve.\n\n[[Quadratic function|Quadratic]] and [[Cubic function|cubic]] B\u00e9zier curves are most common. Higher degree curves are more [[computationally expensive]] to evaluate. When more complex shapes are needed, low order B\u00e9zier curves are patched together, producing a [[composite B\u00e9zier curve]]. A composite B\u00e9zier curve is commonly referred to as a \"path\" in [[vector graphics]] languages (like [[PostScript]]), vector graphics standards (like [[SVG]]) and vector graphics programs (like [[Artline (program)|Artline]], [[Timeworks Publisher]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[CorelDraw]] and [[Inkscape]]). To guarantee [[smoothness]] (''C''<sup>1</sup> continuity{{Clarify|date=September 2017}}), the control point at which two curves meet must be on the line between the two control points on either side.\n\nThe simplest method for scan converting ([[Rasterisation|rasterizing]]) a B\u00e9zier curve is to evaluate it at many closely spaced points and scan convert the approximating sequence of line segments. However, this does not guarantee that the rasterized output looks sufficiently smooth, because the points may be spaced too far apart. Conversely it may generate too many points in areas where the curve is close to linear. A common adaptive method is recursive subdivision, in which a curve's control points are checked to see if the curve approximates a straight line to within a small tolerance.

The norm is required to satisfy\n\n:<math> \\forall x, y \\in A : \\|x \\, y\\| \\ \\leq  \\|x \\| \\, \\| y\\|. </math>\n\nThis ensures that the multiplication operation is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].\n\nA Banach algebra is called ''unital'' if it has an [[identity element]] for the multiplication whose norm is 1, and ''commutative'' if its multiplication is [[commutative]].\nAny Banach algebra <math>A</math> (whether it has an [[identity element]] or not) can be embedded isometrically into a unital Banach algebra <math>A_e</math> so as to form a closed ideal of <math>A_e</math>. Often one assumes ''a priori'' that the algebra under consideration is unital: for one can develop much of the theory by considering <math>A_e</math> and then applying the outcome in the original algebra. However, this is not the case all the time. For example, one cannot define all the trigonometric functions in a Banach algebra without identity.\n\nThe theory of real Banach algebras can be very different from the theory of complex Banach algebras. For example, the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of an element of a nontrivial complex Banach algebra can never be empty, whereas in a real Banach algebra it could be empty for some elements.\n\nBanach algebras can also be defined over fields of [[p-adic number]]s. This is part of [[p-adic analysis]].\n\n== Examples ==\nThe prototypical example of a Banach algebra is <math>C_0(X)</math>, the space of (complex-valued) continuous functions on a locally compact (Hausdorff) space that vanish at infinity. <math>C_0(X)</math> is unital if and only if ''X'' is compact. The complex conjugation being an involution, <math>C_0(X)</math> is in fact a [[C*-algebra]]. More generally, every C*-algebra is a Banach algebra.\n\n* The set of real (or complex) numbers is a Banach algebra with norm given by the [[absolute value]].\n* The set of all real or complex ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] becomes a [[unital algebra|unital]] Banach algebra if we equip it with a sub-multiplicative [[matrix norm]].\n* Take the Banach space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>  (or '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>) with norm ||''x''|| = max |''x''<sub>''i''</sub>| and define multiplication componentwise: (''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)(''y''<sub>1</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) = (''x''<sub>1</sub>''y''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>''y''<sub>''n''</sub>).\n* The [[quaternion]]s form a 4-dimensional real Banach algebra, with the norm being given by the absolute value of quaternions.\n* The algebra of all bounded real- or complex-valued functions defined on some set (with pointwise multiplication and the [[supremum]] norm) is a unital Banach algebra.\n* The algebra of all bounded [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] real- or complex-valued functions on some [[locally compact space]] (again with pointwise operations and supremum norm) is a Banach algebra.\n* The algebra of all [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear transformation|linear]] operators on a Banach space ''E'' (with functional composition as multiplication and the [[operator norm]] as norm) is a unital Banach algebra.

(In particular, the exponential map can be used to define [[abstract index group]]s.) The formula for the [[geometric series]] remains valid in general unital Banach algebras. The [[binomial theorem]] also holds for two commuting elements of a Banach algebra.\n\nThe set of [[invertible element]]s in any unital Banach algebra is an [[open set]], and the inversion operation on this set is continuous, (and hence is a homeomorphism) so that it forms a [[topological group]] under multiplication.<ref>{{harvnb|Conway|1990|loc=Theorem VII.2.2.}}</ref>\n\nIf a Banach algebra has unit '''1''', then '''1''' cannot be a [[commutator (ring theory)|commutator]]; i.e., <math>xy - yx \\ne \\mathbf{1}</math>&thinsp; for any ''x'', ''y''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A''. This is because ''xy'' and ''yx'' have the same [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] except possibly ''0''.\n\nThe various algebras of functions given in the examples above have very different properties from standard examples of algebras such as the reals. For example:\n\n* Every real Banach algebra which is a [[division algebra]] is isomorphic to the reals, the complexes, or the quaternions. Hence, the only complex Banach algebra which is a division algebra is the complexes. (This is known as the [[Gelfand\u2013Mazur theorem]].)\n* Every unital real Banach algebra with no [[zero divisor]]s, and in which every [[principal ideal]] is [[closed set|closed]], is isomorphic to the reals, the complexes, or the quaternions.\n* Every commutative real unital [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] Banach algebra with no zero divisors is isomorphic to the real or complex numbers.\n* Every commutative real unital Noetherian Banach algebra (possibly having zero divisors) is finite-dimensional.\n* Permanently singular elements in Banach algebras are [[topological divisor of zero|topological divisors of zero]], ''i.e.'', considering extensions ''B'' of Banach algebras ''A'' some elements that are singular in the given algebra ''A'' have a multiplicative inverse element in a Banach algebra extension ''B''.  Topological divisors of zero in ''A'' are permanently singular in all Banach extension ''B'' of&nbsp;''A''.\n\n== Spectral theory ==\n{{main|Spectral theory}}\n\nUnital Banach algebras over the complex field provide a general setting to develop spectral theory. The ''spectrum'' of an element ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A'', denoted by <math>\\sigma(x)</math>, consists of all those complex [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s ''\u03bb'' such that ''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''\u03bb'''''1''' is not invertible in ''A''.  The spectrum of any element ''x'' is a closed subset of the closed disc in '''C''' with radius ||''x''|| and center 0, and thus is  [[Compact space|compact]]. Moreover, the spectrum <math>\\sigma(x)</math> of an element ''x'' is [[non-empty]] and satisfies the [[spectral radius]] formula:\n\n:<math>\\sup \\{ |\\lambda| : \\lambda \\in \\sigma(x) \\} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|x^n\\|^{1/n}.</math>\n\nGiven ''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''A'', the [[holomorphic functional calculus]] allows to define ''\u0192''(''x'')&nbsp;\u2208 ''A'' for any function ''\u0192'' [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] in a neighborhood of <math>\\sigma(x).</math>  Furthermore, the spectral mapping theorem holds:\n\n:<math>\\sigma(f(x)) = f(\\sigma(x)).</math><ref>{{harvnb|Takesaki|1979|loc=Proposition 2.8.}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Banach algebra ''A'' is the algebra L(''X'') of bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space ''X''&thinsp; (e.g., the algebra of square matrices), the notion of the spectrum in ''A'' coincides with the usual one in the operator theory. For ''\u0192''&nbsp;&isin; ''C''(''X'') (with a compact Hausdorff space&nbsp;''X''), one sees that:\n\n:<math>\\sigma(f) = \\{ f(t) : t \\in X \\}.</math>\n\nThe norm of a normal element ''x'' of a C*-algebra coincides with its spectral radius.  This generalizes an analogous fact for normal operators.\n\nLet ''A''&thinsp; be a complex unital Banach algebra in which every non-zero element ''x'' is invertible (a division algebra).  For every ''a''&nbsp;&isin; ''A'', there is ''\u03bb''&nbsp;&isin; '''C''' such that\n''a''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''\u03bb'''''1''' is not invertible (because the spectrum of ''a'' is not empty) hence ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03bb'''''1'''&nbsp;:  this algebra ''A'' is naturally isomorphic to '''C''' (the complex case of the Gelfand\u2013Mazur theorem).\n\n== Ideals and characters ==\nLet ''A''&thinsp; be a unital ''commutative'' Banach algebra over '''C'''. Since ''A'' is then a commutative ring with unit, every non-invertible element of ''A'' belongs to some [[maximal ideal]] of ''A''. Since a maximal ideal <math>\\mathfrak m</math> in ''A'' is closed, <math>A / \\mathfrak m</math> is a Banach algebra that is a field, and it follows from the Gelfand\u2013Mazur theorem that there is a bijection between the set of all maximal ideals of ''A'' and the set \u0394(''A'') of all nonzero homomorphisms from ''A''&thinsp; to '''C'''. The set \u0394(''A'') is called the \"[[structure space]]\" or \"character space\" of ''A'', and its members \"characters.\"\n\nA character \u03c7 is a linear functional on ''A'' which is at the same time multiplicative, \u03c7(''ab'') = \u03c7(''a'') \u03c7(''b''), and satisfies ''\u03c7''('''1''') = 1.  Every character is automatically continuous from ''A''&thinsp; to '''C''', since the kernel of a character is a maximal ideal, which is closed. Moreover, the norm (''i.e.'', operator norm) of a character is one. Equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence on ''A'' (''i.e.'', the topology induced by the weak-* topology of&nbsp;''A''<sup>\u2217</sup>), the character space, \u0394(''A''), is a Hausdorff compact space.\n\nFor any ''x'' \u2208 ''A'',\n\n:<math>\\sigma(x) = \\sigma(\\hat x)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hat x</math> is the [[Gelfand representation]] of ''x'' defined as follows: <math>\\hat x</math> is the continuous function from \u0394(''A'') to '''C''' given by <math>\\hat x(\\chi) = \\chi(x).</math>&thinsp;  The spectrum of <math>\\hat x,</math> in the formula above, is the spectrum as element of the algebra ''C''(\u0394(''A'')) of complex continuous functions on the compact space \u0394(''A'').  Explicitly,\n\n:<math>\\sigma(\\hat x) = \\{ \\chi(x) : \\chi \\in \\Delta(A) \\}</math>.\n\nAs an algebra, a unital commutative Banach algebra is [[semisimple algebra|semisimple]] (i.e., its [[Jacobson radical]] is zero) if and only if its Gelfand representation has trivial kernel. An important example of such an algebra is a commutative C*-algebra. In fact, when ''A'' is a commutative unital C*-algebra, the Gelfand representation is then an isometric *-isomorphism between ''A'' and  ''C''(\u0394(''A'')) .<ref group=nb>Proof: Since every element of a commutative C*-algebra is normal, the Gelfand representation is isometric; in particular, it is injective and its image is closed. But the image of the Gelfand representation is dense by the [[Stone-Weierstrass theorem]].</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Operator algebra]]\n* [[Shilov boundary]]\n* [[Automatic continuity]]\n* [[Kaplansky's conjecture]]\n* [[Approximate identity]]\n\n==Remarks==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first=B|last=Bollob\u00e1s|authorlink=B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s|title=Linear Analysis|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-521-38729-9}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first1=F.

In his native Russian, Pasternak's first book of poems, ''My Sister, Life'' (1917), is one of the most influential collections ever published in the [[Russian language]]. Pasternak's translations of [[stage play]]s by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] remain very popular with Russian audiences. \n\nAs a novelist, Pasternak is also known as the author of ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1957), a novel which takes place between the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] and the [[Second World War]]. ''Doctor Zhivago'' was rejected for publication in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2014-press-releases-statements/cia-declassifies-agency-role-in-publishing-doctor-zhivago.html cia.gov \u2013 CIA Declassifies Agency Role in Publishing Doctor Zhivago]</ref> Pasternak was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1958, an event which enraged the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], which forced him to decline the prize, though his descendants were later to accept it in his name in 1988.

His mother was [[Rosa Kaufman]], a concert pianist and the daughter of [[Odessa]] industrialist Isadore Kaufman and his wife. Pasternak had a younger brother Alex and sisters [[Lydia Pasternak Slater|Lydia]] and Josephine. The family claimed to be descended on the paternal line from [[Isaac Abrabanel]], the famous 15th-century [[Sephardic Jewish]] treasurer of Portugal.<ref>''Boris Pasternak: A Literary Biography'', By Christopher Barnes, page 2</ref>\n\n=== Early education ===\nFrom 1904 to 1907 Boris Pasternak was the cloister-mate of Peter Minchakievich (1890\u20131963) in [[Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra]], located in West Ukraine. Minchakievich came from an Orthodox Ukrainian family and Pasternak came from a Jewish family. Some confusion has arisen as to Pasternak attending a military academy in his boyhood years. The uniforms of their monastery Cadet Corp were only similar to those of The Czar Alexander the Third Military Academy, as Pasternak and Minchakievich never attended any military academy. Most schools used a distinctive military looking uniform particular to them as was the custom of the time in Eastern Europe and Russia. Boyhood friends, they parted in 1908, friendly but with different politics, never to see each other again. Pasternak went to the Moscow Conservatory to study music (later Germany to study philosophy), and Minchakievich went to L'viv University (L'vov, L'wow) to study history and philosophy. The good dimension of the character Strelnikov in Dr. Zhivago is based upon Peter Minchakievich. Several of Pasternak's characters are composites. After World War One and the Revolution, fighting for the Provisional or Republican government under Kerensky, and then escaping a Communist jail and execution, Minchakievich trekked across Siberia in 1917 and became an American citizen. Pasternak stayed in Russia.\n\nIn a 1959 letter to [[Jacqueline de Proyart]], Pasternak recalled,\n\n{{quote|I was baptized as a child by my [[nanny]], but because of the restrictions imposed on Jews, particularly in the case of a family which was exempt from them and enjoyed a certain reputation in view of my father's standing as an artist, there was something a little complicated about this, and it was always felt to be half-secret and intimate, a source of rare and exceptional inspiration rather than being calmly taken for granted. I believe that this is at the root of my distinctiveness. Most intensely of all my mind was occupied by Christianity in the years 1910\u201312, when the main foundations of this distinctiveness \u2013 my way of seeing things, the world, life \u2013 were taking shape...<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 137.</ref>}}\n\nShortly after his birth, Pasternak's parents had joined the [[Tolstoyan]] Movement. Novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] was a close family friend, as Pasternak recalled, \"my father illustrated his books, went to see him, revered him, and ...the whole house was imbued with his spirit.\"<ref>Pasternak (1959) p 25</ref>\n\nIn a 1956 essay, Pasternak recalled his father's feverish work creating illustrations for Tolstoy's novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]''.<ref name=\"Past28\"/> The novel was serialized in the journal ''[[Niva (magazine)|Niva]]'' by the publisher [[Adolf Marks|Fyodor Marx]], based in St Petersburg. The sketches were drawn from observations in such places as courtrooms, prisons and on trains, in a spirit of realism. To ensure that the sketches met the journal deadline, train conductors were enlisted to personally collect the illustrations. Pasternak wrote,\n\n{{quote|My childish imagination was struck by the sight of a train conductor in his formal railway uniform, standing waiting at the door of the kitchen as if he were standing on a railway platform at the door of a compartment that was just about to leave the station. Joiner's glue was boiling on the stove. The illustrations were hurriedly wiped dry, fixed, glued on pieces of cardboard, rolled up, tied up. The parcels, once ready, were sealed with sealing wax and handed to the conductor.<ref name=\"Past28\">Pasternak (1959) pp 27\u201328.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[Max Hayward]], \"In November 1910, when Tolstoy fled from his home and died in the stationmaster's house at [[Astapovo]], Leonid Pasternak was informed by telegram and he went there immediately, taking his son Boris with him, and made a drawing of Tolstoy on his deathbed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p ''xvi''.</ref>\n\nRegular visitors to the Pasternak's home also included [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]. Pasternak aspired first to be a musician.<ref>Pasternak (1967)</ref> Inspired by Scriabin, Pasternak briefly was a student at the [[Moscow Conservatory]]. In 1910 he abruptly left for the [[Imperial Germany|German]] [[University of Marburg]], where he studied under [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]] and [[Paul Natorp]].\n\n==Life and Career==\n\n=== Olga Freidenberg ===\nIn 1910 Pasternak was reunited with his cousin, [[Olga Freidenberg]] (1890-1955). They had shared the same nursery but had been separated when the Freidenberg family moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]. They fell in love immediately but were never lovers. The romance however is made clear from their letters, Pasternak writing:<blockquote>\u2018You do not know how my tormenting feeling grew and grew until it became obvious to me and to others. As you walked beside me with complete detachment, I could not express it to you. It was a rare sort of closeness, as if we two, you and I, were in love with something that was utterly indifferent to both of us, something that remained aloof from us by virtue of its extraordinary inability to adapt to the other side of life.'</blockquote>The cousins' initial passion developed into a lifelong close friendship. From 1910 Pasternak and Freidenberg exchanged frequent letters, and their correspondence lasted over 40 years until 1954. The cousins last met in 1936.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ivka.rsuh.ru/binary/85345_30.1476388407.9268.pdf|title=Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly|last=Braginskaya|first=Nina V.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780191089657|editor-last=Wyles|editor-first=Rosie|location=|pages=286\u2013312|translator-last=Tarlone|translator-first=Zara M.|chapter=Olga Freidenberg: A Creative Mind Incarcerated|editor-last2=Hall|editor-first2=Edith|translator-last2=Zeide|translator-first2=Alla|translator-last3=Maslov|translator-first3=Boris}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/23/books/books-of-the-times-228311.html|title=BOOKS OF THE TIMES|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}</ref> \n\n=== Ida Wissotzkaya ===\n[[File:BORIS BESIDE THE BALTIC AT MEREKULE, 1910 by L.Pasternak.jpg|thumb|right|''Boris Pasternak in 1910,'' by his father Leonid Pasternak]]\nPasternak fell in love with Ida Wissotzkaya, a girl from a notable Moscow Jewish [[:ru:\u0412\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0412\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0444 \u042f\u043d\u043a\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|family of tea merchants]], whose company [[Wissotzky Tea]] was the largest tea company in the world. Pasternak had tutored her in the final class of high school. He helped her prepare for finals. They met in Marburg during the summer of 1912 when Boris' father, [[Leonid Pasternak]], painted her portrait.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 p 395\">Ivinskaya (1978) p 395.</ref>\n\nAlthough Professor Cohen encouraged him to remain in Germany and to pursue a Philosophy doctorate, Pasternak decided against it. He returned to Moscow upon the outbreak of World War I. His first book of poems was published later that year. In the aftermath, Pasternak proposed marriage to Ida. However, the Wissotzky family was disturbed by Pasternak's poor prospects and persuaded Ida to refuse him. She turned him down and he told of his love and rejection in the poem \"Marburg\" (1917):<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 p 395\"/>\n\n<blockquote><poem>I quivered. I flared up, and then was extinguished.\nI shook. I had made a proposal\u2014but late,\nToo late. I was scared, and she had refused me.\nI pity her tears, am more blessed than a saint.</poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother failed love affair in 1917 inspired the poems in his first book, ''[[My Sister, Life]]''. His early verse cleverly dissimulates his preoccupation with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy. Its fabric includes striking alliterations, wild rhythmic combinations, day-to-day vocabulary, and hidden allusions to his favourite poets such as [[Rilke]], [[Lermontov]], [[Pushkin]] and German-language Romantic poets.\n\nDuring World War I, Pasternak taught and worked at a chemical factory in [[Vsevolodovo-Vilve]] near [[Perm]], which undoubtedly provided him with material for ''Dr. Zhivago'' many years later. Unlike the rest of his family and many of his closest friends, Pasternak chose not to leave Russia after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. According to [[Max Hayward]],\n\n{{quote|Pasternak remained in Moscow throughout the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] (1918\u20131920), making no attempt to escape abroad or to the [[White Movement|White-occupied]] south, as a number of other Russian writers did at the time. No doubt, like Yuri Zhivago, he was momentarily impressed by the \"splendid surgery\" of the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917, but \u2013 again to judge by the evidence of the novel, and despite a personal admiration for [[Vladimir Lenin]], whom he saw at the [[Ninth party Congress|9th Congress of Soviets]] in 1921 \u2013 he soon began to harbor profound doubts about the claims and credentials of the regime, not to mention its style of rule. The terrible shortages of food and fuel, and the depredations of the [[Red Terror]], made life very precarious in those years, particularly for the \"[[bourgeois]]\" [[intelligentsia]]. In a letter written to Pasternak from abroad in the twenties, [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] reminded him of how she had run into him in the street in 1919 as he was on the way to sell some valuable books from his library in order to buy bread. He continued to write original work and to translate, but after about the middle of 1918 it became almost impossible to publish. The only way to make one's work known was to declaim it in the several \"literary\" cafes which then sprang up, or \u2013 anticipating [[samizdat]] \u2013 to circulate it in manuscript. It was in this way that ''My Sister, Life'' first became available to a wider audience.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p xxiii.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Mayakovsky Pasternak.jpg|thumb|Pasternak (second from left) in 1924, with friends including [[Lilya Brik]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]] (third from left) and [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] (centre)]]\nWhen it finally was published in 1921, Pasternak's ''My Sister, Life'' revolutionised Russian poetry. It made Pasternak the model for younger poets, and decisively changed the poetry of [[Osip Mandelshtam]], [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] and others.\n\nFollowing ''My Sister, Life'', Pasternak produced some hermetic pieces of uneven quality, including his masterpiece, the lyric cycle ''Rupture'' (1921). Both Pro-Soviet writers and their [[White emigre]] equivalents applauded Pasternak's poetry as pure, unbridled inspiration.\n\nIn the late 1920s, he also participated in the much celebrated tripartite correspondence with [[Rilke]] and [[Tsvetayeva]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bayley|first=John|title=Big Three|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5268|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]| volume= 32|date= 5 December 1985|accessdate=28 September 2007|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> As the 1920s wore on, however, Pasternak increasingly felt that his colourful style was at odds with a less educated readership. He attempted to make his poetry more comprehensible by reworking his earlier pieces and starting two lengthy poems on the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. He also turned to prose and wrote several autobiographical stories, notably \"The Childhood of Luvers\" and \"Safe Conduct\".\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak with family 1920s.jpg|thumb|Pasternak with Evgeniya Lurye and son]]\nIn 1922 Pasternak married Evgeniya Lurye (\u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0443\u0440\u044c\u0435), a student at the Art Institute. The following year they had a son, Evgenii.\n\nEvidence of Pasternak's support of still-revolutionary members of the leadership of the Communist Party as late as 1926 is indicated by his worshipful poem \"In Memory of Reissner\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/women/authors/reissner/works/hamburg/app3.htm |title=In Memory of Reissner |last1=Pasternak |first1=Boris |last2= |first2= |date=1926|website=marxists.org |accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref> presumably written upon the shockingly premature death from typhus of legendary Bolshevik leader [[Larisa Reisner]] at age 30 in February of that year.\n\nBy 1927, Pasternak's close friends [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and [[Nikolai Aseyev]] were advocating the complete subordination of the arts to the needs of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].<ref>''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence, 1921\u20131960,'' p 78.</ref> In a letter to his sister Josephine, Pasternak wrote of his intentions to, \"break off relations,\" with both of them. Although he expressed that it would be deeply painful, Pasternak explained that it could not be prevented. He explained,\n\n{{quote|They don't in any way measure up to their exalted calling. In fact, they've fallen short of it but \u2013 difficult as it is for me to understand \u2013 a modern [[sophist]] might say that these last years have actually demanded a reduction in conscience and feeling in the name of greater intelligibility. Yet now the very spirit of the times demands great, courageous purity. And these men are ruled by trivial routine. Subjectively, they're sincere and conscientious. But I find it increasingly difficult to take into account the personal aspect of their convictions. I'm not out on my own \u2013 people treat me well. But all that only holds good up to a point. It seems to me that I've reached that point.<ref>Nicholas Pasternak Slater, ''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence 1921\u20131960'', p 80.</ref>}}\n\nBy 1932, Pasternak had strikingly reshaped his style to make it more understandable to the general public and printed the new collection of poems, aptly titled ''The Second Birth''. Although its Caucasian pieces were as brilliant as the earlier efforts, the book alienated the core of Pasternak's refined audience abroad, which was largely composed of anti-communist emigres.\n\nIn 1932 Pasternak fell in love with Zinaida Neuhaus, the wife of the Russian pianist [[Heinrich Neuhaus]]. They both got divorces and married two years later.\n\nHe continued to change his poetry, simplifying his style and language through the years, as expressed in his next book, ''Early Trains'' (1943).\n\n===Stalin Epigram===\nIn April 1934 [[Osip Mandelstam]] recited his \"[[Stalin Epigram]]\" to Pasternak. After listening, Pasternak told Mandelstam: \"I didn't hear this, you didn't recite it to me, because, you know, very strange and terrible things are happening now: they've begun to pick people up. I'm afraid the walls have ears and perhaps even these benches on the boulevard here may be able to listen and tell tales. So let's make out that I heard nothing.\"<ref name=\"Ivin61\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 61\u201363</ref>\n\nOn the night of 14 May 1934, Mandelstam was arrested at his home based on a warrant signed by [[NKVD]] boss [[Genrikh Yagoda]]. Devastated, Pasternak went immediately to the offices of ''[[Izvestia]]'' and begged [[Nikolai Bukharin]] to intercede on Mandelstam's behalf.\n\nSoon after his meeting with Bukharin, the telephone rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment. A voice from [[Moscow Kremlin|The Kremlin]] said, \"Comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] wishes to speak with you.\"<ref name=\"Ivin61\"/> According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. \"He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then he heard ''his'' voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar ''thou'' form: 'Tell me, what are they saying in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'\" Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an \"eager fumbling manner\" Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: \"I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade,\" and put down the receiver.<ref name=\"Ivin61\"/>\n\n===Great Purge===\n{{Main article|Great Purge}}\nAccording to Pasternak, during the 1937 [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|show trial]] of General [[Iona Yakir]] and Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] requested all members to add their names to a statement supporting the death penalty for the defendants. They demanded Pasternak's signature as well, but he refused to give it. [[Vladimir Stavsky|Vladimir Stavski]], the chairman of the Union, was terrified that he would be punished for Pasternak's dissent. The leadership of the Union travelled to Pasternak's dacha at [[Peredelkino]] and severely threatened the writer, who refused to sign the statement and returned to his [[dacha]]. Hearing this, Zinaida Pasternak, who was pregnant, was terribly upset, accusing him of risking the destruction of their family. Pasternak went to bed. He and Zinaida expected to be arrested that evening. They later learned that an [[NKVD]] agent was hiding in the bushes outside their window and wrote down every word they said to each other.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 132\u2013133</ref>\n\nSoon after, Pasternak appealed directly to Stalin. He wrote about his family's strong [[Tolstoyan]] convictions, which he still held dear. He declared that his own life was at the Leader's disposal. He said that he could not stand as a self-appointed judge of life and death. Pasternak was certain that he would be instantly arrested, but he was not.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133\"/> Stalin is said to have crossed Pasternak's name off an execution list during the [[Great Purge]]. According to Pasternak, Stalin declared, \"Do not touch this cloud dweller\" (or, in another version, \"Leave that [[Foolishness for Christ|holy fool]] alone!\")<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 133.</ref>\n\nAlthough Pasternak was never arrested by the [[Soviet secret police]], his close friend [[Titsian Tabidze]] fell victim to the Great Purge. In an autobiographical essay published in the 1950s, Pasternak described the execution of Tabidze and the [[suicides]] of [[Marina Tsvetaeva]] and [[Paolo Iashvili]] as the greatest heartbreaks of his entire life.\n\nIvinskaya wrote, \"I believe that between Stalin and Pasternak there was an incredible, silent [[duel]].\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 135.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nPasternak was elated by the outbreak of war between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. When the [[Luftwaffe]] began bombing Moscow, Pasternak immediately began to serve as a fire warden on the roof of the writer's building on Lavrushinski Street. According to Ivinskaya, he repeatedly helped to dispose of German bombs which fell on it.<ref name=\"Ivin72\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 72\u201373.</ref>\n\nIn 1943, Pasternak was finally granted permission to visit the soldiers at the front. He bore it well, considering the hardships of the journey (he had a weak leg from an old injury), and he wanted to go to the most dangerous places. He read his poetry and talked extensively with the active and injured troops.<ref name=\"Ivin72\"/>\n\nWith the end of the war in 1945, the Soviet people expected to see the end of the devastation of [[Nazism]], and hoped for the end of Stalin's Purges. But sealed trains began carrying large numbers of prisoners to the Soviet [[Gulag]]s. Some were [[Nazi collaborator]]s who had fought under General [[Andrey Vlasov]], but most were ordinary Soviet officers and men. Pasternak watched as ex-POWs were directly transferred from Nazi Germany to Soviet [[concentration camp]]s. [[White emigre]]s who had returned due to pledges of [[amnesty]] were also sent directly to the Gulag, as were Jews from the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee|Anti-Fascist Committee]] and other organizations. Many thousands of innocent people were incarcerated in connection with the [[Leningrad Affair]] and the so-called [[Doctor's Plot]], while whole ethnic groups were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported to Siberia]].<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 75.</ref>\n\nPasternak later said, \"If, in a bad dream, we had seen all the horrors in store for us after the war, we should not have been sorry to see Stalin fall, together with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Then, an end to the war in favour of our [[Allies of World War II|allies]], civilized countries with democratic traditions, would have meant a hundred times less suffering for our people than that which Stalin again inflicted on it after his victory.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 80.</ref>\n\n===Olga Ivinskaya===\nIn October 1946, the twice married Pasternak met [[Olga Ivinskaya]], a 34 year old single mother employed by ''[[Novy Mir]]''. Deeply moved by her resemblance to his first love Ida Vysotskaya,<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) pp 12, 395, footnote 3.</ref> Pasternak gave Ivinskaya several volumes of his poetry and literary translations. Although Pasternak never left his wife Zinaida, he started an extramarital relationship with Ivinskaya that would last for the remainder of Pasternak's life. Ivinskaya later recalled, \"He phoned almost every day and, instinctively fearing to meet or talk with him, yet dying of happiness, I would stammer out that I was \"busy today.\" But almost every afternoon, toward the end of working hours, he came in person to the office and often walked with me through the streets, boulevards, and squares all the way home to Potapov Street. 'Shall I make you a present of this square?' he would ask.\"\n\nShe gave him the phone number of her neighbour Olga Volkova who resided below. In the evenings, Pasternak would phone and Volkova would signal by Olga banging on the water pipe which connected their apartments.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 12.</ref>\n\nWhen they first met, Pasternak was translating the verse of the Hungarian [[List of national poets|national poet]], [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]]. Pasternak gave his lover a book of Pet\u0151fi with the inscription, \"Pet\u0151fi served as a code in May and June 1947, and my close translations of his lyrics are an expression, adapted to the requirements of the text, of my feelings and thoughts for you and about you. In memory of it all, B.P., 13 May 1948.\"\n\nPasternak later noted on a photograph of himself, \"Pet\u0151fi is magnificent with his descriptive lyrics and picture of nature, but you are better still. I worked on him a good deal in 1947 and 1948, when I first came to know you. Thank you for your help. I was translating both of you.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 27.</ref> Ivinskaya would later describe the Pet\u0151fi translations as, \"a first declaration of love.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 28.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, Zinaida Pasternak was infuriated by her husband's infidelity. Once, when his younger son Leonid fell seriously ill, Zinaida extracted a promise from her husband, as they stood by the boy's sickbed, that he would end his affair with Ivinskaya. Pasternak asked Luisa Popova, a mutual friend, to tell Ivinskaya about his promise. Popova told him that he must do it himself. Soon after, Ivinskaya happened to be ill at Popova's apartment, when suddenly Zinaida Pasternak arrived and confronted her.\n\nIvinskaya later recalled,\n\n{{quote|But I became so ill through loss of blood that she and Luisa had to get me to the hospital, and I no longer remember exactly what passed between me and this heavily built, strong-minded woman, who kept repeating how she didn't give a damn for our love and that, although she no longer loved [Boris Leonidovich] herself, she would not allow her family to be broken up. After my return from the hospital, Boris came to visit me, as though nothing had happened, and touchingly made his peace with my mother, telling her how much he loved me. By now she was pretty well used to these funny ways of his.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 23.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1948, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya to resign her job at ''Novy Mir'', which was becoming extremely difficult due to their relationship. In the aftermath, Pasternak began to instruct her in translating poetry. In time, they began to refer to her apartment on Potapov Street as, \"Our Shop.\"\n\nOn the evening of 6 October 1949, Ivinskaya was arrested at her apartment by the [[KGB]]. Ivinskaya relates in her memoirs that, when the agents burst into her apartment, she was at her typewriter working on translations of the [[Korean poetry|Korean poet]] [[Won Tu-Son]]. Her apartment was ransacked and all items connected with Pasternak were piled up in her presence. Ivinskaya was taken to the [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka Prison]] and repeatedly interrogated, where she refused to say anything incriminating about Pasternak. At the time, she was pregnant with Pasternak's child and had a miscarriage early in her ten-year sentence in the [[GULAG]].\n\nUpon learning of his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]' arrest, Pasternak telephoned Liuisa Popova and asked her to come at once to [[Gogol Boulevard]]. She found him sitting on a bench near the [[Kropotkinskaya|Palace of Soviets Metro Station]]. Weeping, Pasternak told her, \"Everything is finished now. They've taken her away from me and I'll never see her again. It's like death, even worse.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 86\">Ivinskaya (1978), p 86.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, \"After this, in conversation with people he scarcely knew, he always referred to Stalin as a 'murderer.' Talking with people in the offices of literary periodicals, he often asked: 'When will there be an end to this freedom for lackeys who happily walk over corpses to further their own interests?' He spent a good deal of time with [[Anna Akhmatova|Akhmatova]]\u2014who in those years was given a very wide berth by most of the people who knew her. He worked intensively on the second part of ''Doctor Zhivago''.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 86\"/>\n\nIn a 1958 letter to a friend in [[West Germany]], Pasternak wrote, \"She was put in jail on my account, as the person considered by the [[KGB|secret police]] to be closest to me, and they hoped that by means of a gruelling interrogation and threats they could extract enough evidence from her to put me on trial. I owe my life, and the fact that they did not touch me in those years, to her heroism and endurance.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 109.</ref>\n\n===Translating Goethe===\nPasternak's translation of the [[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|first part]] of ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' led him to be attacked in the August 1950 edition of ''[[Novy Mir]]''. The critic accused Pasternak of distorting [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s \"progressive\" meanings to support \"the reactionary theory of 'pure art'\", as well as introducing aesthetic and [[individualist]] values. In a subsequent letter to the daughter of Marina Tsvetaeva, Pasternak explained that the attack was motivated by the fact that the supernatural elements of the play, which ''Novy Mir'' considered, \"irrational,\" had been translated as Goethe had written them. Pasternak further declared that, despite the attacks on his translation, his contract for the [[Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy|second part]] had not been revoked.<ref name=\"Ivin78\"/>\n\n===Khrushchev thaw===\nWhen Stalin died of a stroke on 5 March 1953, Olga Ivinskaya was still imprisoned in the [[Gulag]], and Pasternak was in Moscow. Across the nation, there were waves of panic, confusion, and public displays of grief. Pasternak wrote, \"Men who are not free... always idealize their bondage.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 144.</ref>\n\nAfter her release, Pasternak's relationship with Ivinskaya picked up where it had left off. Soon after he confided in her, \"For so long we were ruled over by a madman and a murderer, and now by a fool and a pig. The madman had his occasional flights of fancy, he had an intuitive feeling for certain things, despite his wild obscurantism. Now we are ruled over by mediocrities.\"<ref name=\"Ivin142\">Ivinskaya (1978) p 142.</ref> During this period, Pasternak delighted in reading a clandestine copy of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' in English. In conversation with Ivinskaya, Pasternak explained that the pig dictator [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], in the novel, \"vividly reminded\" him of Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].<ref name=\"Ivin142\"/>\n\n===''Doctor Zhivago''===\n\n\nAlthough it contains passages written in the 1910s and 1920s, ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' was not completed until 1956. Pasternak submitted the novel to [[Novy Mir]], which refused publication due to its rejection of [[socialist realism]].<ref>\"Doctor Zhivago\": Letter to Boris Pasternak from the Editors of ''Novyi Mir''. Daedalus, Vol. 89, No. 3, The Russian Intelligentsia (Summer, 1960), pp.&nbsp;648\u2013668</ref> The author, like his [[protagonist]] [[Yuri Zhivago]], showed more concern for the welfare of individual characters than for the \"progress\" of society. Censors also regarded some passages as [[anti-Soviet]], especially the novel's criticisms{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} of [[Stalinism]], [[Collectivisation]], the [[Great Purge]], and the [[Gulag]].\n\nPasternak's fortunes were soon to change, however. In March 1956, the [[Italian Communist Party]] sent a journalist, [[Sergio D'Angelo]], to work in the Soviet Union, and his status as a journalist as well as his membership in the Italian Communist Party allowed him to have access to various aspects of the cultural life in Moscow at the time. A Milan publisher, the communist [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]], had also given him a commission to find new works of Soviet literature that would be appealing to Western audiences, and upon learning of ''Doctor Zhivago'''s existence, D'Angelo travelled immediately to Peredelkino and offered to submit Pasternak's novel to Feltrinelli's company for publication. At first Pasternak was stunned. Then he brought the manuscript from his study and told D'Angelo with a laugh, \"You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad.\"<ref>Lazar Fleishman, ''Boris Pasternak: The Poet and His Politics'', p 275.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak was aware that he was taking a huge risk. No Soviet author had attempted to deal with Western publishers since the 1920s, when such behavior led the Soviet State to declare war on [[Boris Pilnyak]] and [[Evgeny Zamyatin]]. Pasternak, however, believed that Feltrinelli's Communist affiliation would not only guarantee publication, but might even force the Soviet State to publish the novel in Russia.<ref>Fleishman, pp 275\u2013276.</ref>\n\nIn a rare moment of agreement, both Olga Ivinskaya and Zinaida Pasternak were horrified by the submission of ''Doctor Zhivago'' to a Western publishing house. Pasternak, however, refused to change his mind and informed an emissary from Feltrinelli that he was prepared to undergo any sacrifice in order to see ''Doctor Zhivago'' published.<ref>Fleishman, p 276.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Feltrinelli announced that the novel would be published by his company. Despite repeated demands from visiting Soviet emissaries, Feltrinelli refused to cancel or delay publication. According to Ivinskaya, \"He did not believe that we would ever publish the manuscript here and felt he had no right to withhold a masterpiece from the world \u2013 this would be an even greater crime.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 203.</ref> The Soviet government forced Pasternak to cable the publisher to withdraw the manuscript, but he sent separate, secret letters advising Feltrinelli to ignore the telegrams.{{r|washingtonpost}}\n\nHelped considerably by the Soviet campaign against the novel (as well as by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s secret purchase of hundreds of copies of the book as it came off the presses around the world \u2013 see \"Nobel Prize\" section below), ''Doctor Zhivago'' became an instant sensation throughout the non-Communist world upon its release in November 1957. In the [[State of Israel]], however, Pasternak's novel was sharply criticized for its [[assimilationist]] views towards the [[Jewish people]]. When informed of this, Pasternak responded, \"No matter. I am above race...\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 136.</ref> According to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak had written the disputed passages prior to Israeli independence. At the time, Pasternak had also been regularly attending Russian Orthodox [[Divine Liturgy]]. Therefore, he believed that Soviet Jews converting to Christianity was preferable to assimilating into [[atheism]] and [[Stalinism]].<ref>Fleishman, pp 264\u2013266.</ref>\n\nThe first English translation of ''Doctor Zhivago'' was hastily produced by [[Max Hayward]] and [[Manya Harari]] in order to coincide with overwhelming public demand. It was released in August 1958, and remained the only edition available for more than fifty years. Between 1958 and 1959, the English language edition spent 26 weeks at the top of ''[[The New York Times]]''' bestseller list.\n\nIvinskaya's daughter Irina circulated typed copies of the novel in [[Samizdat]]. Although no Soviet critics had read the banned novel, ''Doctor Zhivago'' was pilloried in the State-owned press. Similar attacks led to a humorous Russian saying, \"I haven't read Pasternak, but I condemn him\".<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 268\u2013271.</ref>\n\nDuring the aftermath of the Second World War, Pasternak had composed a series of poems on [[Gospel]] themes. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak had regarded Stalin as a, \"giant of the pre-Christian era.\" Therefore, Pasternak's Christian-themed poems were, \"a form of protest.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 134.</ref>\n\nOn 9 September 1958, the ''Literary Gazette'' critic Viktor Pertsov retaliated by denouncing, \"the decadent religious poetry of Pasternak, which reeks of mothballs from the [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist]] suitcase of 1908\u201310 manufacture.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 231.</ref> Furthermore, the author received much [[hate mail]] from Communists both at home and abroad. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak continued to receive such letters for the remainder of his life.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 230.</ref>\n\nIn a letter written to his sister Josephine, however, Pasternak recalled the words of his friend Ekaterina Krashennikova upon reading ''Doctor Zhivago''. She had said, \"Don't forget yourself to the point of believing that it was you who wrote this work. It was the [[Russian people]] and their sufferings who created it. Thank God for having expressed it through your pen.\"<ref>''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence 1912\u20131960,'' p 403.</ref>\n\n===Nobel Prize===\n[[File:Miniature Volume of Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|Copy of the original Russian-language edition of ''Doctor Zhivago'', covertly published by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].

According to the former Nobel Committee head [[Lars Gyllensten]], his nomination was discussed every year from 1946 to 1950, then again in 1957 (it was finally awarded in 1958). Pasternak guessed at this from the growing waves of criticism in USSR. Sometimes he had to justify his European fame: 'According to the Union of Soviet Writers, some literature circles of the West see unusual importance in my work, not matching its modesty and low productivity\u2026'\"<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/showbiz/18-12-2003/4383-pasternak-0/ |title=Boris Pasternak: Nobel Prize, Son's Memoirs |publisher=English.pravda.ru |date=18 December 2003 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to journalist Ivan Tolstoi, the British [[MI6]] and the American [[CIA]] lent a hand to ensure that ''Doctor Zhivago'' was submitted to the [[Nobel Committee]] in the original Russian. According to Tolstoi, this was done so that Pasternak could win the Nobel prize and harm the international credibility of the [[Soviet Union]].

Pasternak wrote that he was wracked with torments and anxieties at the thought of placing his loved ones in danger.\n\nOn 23 October 1958, Boris Pasternak was announced as the winner of the Nobel Prize. The citation credited Pasternak's contribution to Russian lyric poetry and for his role in \"continuing the great Russian epic tradition.\" On 25 October, Pasternak sent a [[telegram]] to the [[Swedish Academy]]: \"Infinitely grateful, touched, proud, surprised, overwhelmed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 221.</ref> That same day, the Literary Institute in Moscow demanded that all its students sign a petition denouncing Pasternak and his novel.

Slutsky, who in his brutal prose-like poems had created an image for himself as a courageous soldier and truth-lover, was so tormented by his anti-Pasternak speech that he later went insane. On October 29, 1958, at the plenum of the Central Committee of the Young Communist League, dedicated to the [[Komsomol]]'s fortieth anniversary, its head, [[Vladimir Semichastny]], attacked Pasternak before an audience of 14,000 people, including Khrushchev and other Party leaders. Semishastny first called Pasternak, \"a mangy sheep,\" who pleased the enemies of the Soviet Union with, \"his slanderous so-called work.\" Then Semichastny (who became head of the KGB in 1961) added that, \"this man went and spat in the face of the people.\" And he concluded with, \"If you compare Pasternak to a pig, a pig would not do what he did,\" because a pig, \"never shits where it eats.\" Khrushchev applauded demonstratively. News of that speech drove Pasternak to the brink of suicide. It has recently come to light that the real author of Semichastny's insults was Khrushchev, who had called the Komsomol leader the night before and dictated his lines about the mangy sheep and the pig, which Semichastny described as a, \"typically Khrushchevian, deliberately crude, unceremoniously scolding.\"<ref>Solomon Volkov, ''The Magical Chorus: A History of Russian Culture from Tolstoy to Solzhenitsyn'', Alfred A.

As a result, Pasternak sent a second telegram to the Nobel Committee: \"In view of the meaning given the award by the society in which I live, I must renounce this undeserved distinction which has been conferred on me.

Furthermore, he was threatened at the very least with formal exile to the West. In response, Pasternak wrote directly to Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]],\n\n{{quote|I am addressing you personally, the C.C. of the C.P.S.S., and the Soviet Government. From Comrade Semichastny's speech I learn that the government, 'would not put any obstacles in the way of my departure from the U.S.S.R.' For me this is impossible. I am tied to Russia by birth, by my life and work. I cannot conceive of my destiny separate from Russia, or outside it. Whatever my mistakes or failings, I could not imagine that I should find myself at the center of such a political campaign as has been worked up round my name in the West. Once I was aware of this, I informed the Swedish Academy of my voluntary renunciation of the Nobel Prize. Departure beyond the borders of my country would for me be tantamount to death and I therefore request you not to take this extreme measure with me.

In her own memoirs, Olga Ivinskaya blames herself for pressuring her lover into making both decisions.\n\nAccording to Yevgenii Pasternak, \"She accused herself bitterly for persuading Pasternak to decline the Prize. After all that had happened, open shadowing, friends turning away, Pasternak's suicidal condition at the time, one can... understand her: the memory of Stalin's camps was too fresh, [and] she tried to protect him.\"<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nOn 31 October 1958, the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] held a trial behind closed doors. According to the meeting minutes, Pasternak was denounced as an internal [[White emigre]] and a Fascist [[fifth columnist]]. Afterwards, the attendees announced that Pasternak had been expelled from the Union. They further signed a petition to the [[Politburo]], demanding that Pasternak be stripped of his Soviet citizenship and exiled to, \"his Capitalist paradise.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 251\u2013261.</ref> According to Yevgenii Pasternak, however, author [[Konstantin Paustovsky]] refused to attend the meeting. [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] did attend, but walked out in disgust.<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nAccording to Yevgenii Pasternak, his father would have been exiled had it not been for Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who telephoned Khrushchev and threatened to find a Committee for Pasternak's protection.<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nIt is possible that the 1958 Nobel Prize prevented Pasternak's imprisonment due to the Soviet State's fear of international protests. Yevgenii Pasternak believes, however, that the resulting persecution fatally weakened his father's health.{{r|washingtonpost}}\n\nMeanwhile, [[Bill Mauldin]] produced a [[political cartoon]] which won the 1959 [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]].

They contain correspondence, drafts of ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' and other writings, photographs, and other material, of Boris Pasternak and other family members.\n\nSince 2003, the novel Doctor Zhivago has entered the Russian school curriculum, where it is read in the 11th grade of high-school.<ref>[http://www.aif.ru/culture/book/_ne_chital_no_osuzhdayu_5_faktov_o_romane_doktor_zhivago_ \u00ab\u041d\u0435 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0430\u044e!\u00bb: 5 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043e \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u00ab\u0414\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0416\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0433\u043e\u00bb] 18:17 23/10/2013, \u0415\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430</ref>\n\n===Cultural influence===\n*A [[minor planet]] ([[3508 Pasternak]]) discovered by Soviet astronomer [[Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina]] in 1980 is named after him.<ref>{{cite book| last = Schmadel| first = Lutz D.| title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names| page = 294| edition = 5th| year = 2003| publisher = Springer Verlag| location = New York| url = https://books.google.com/books?q=3508+Pasternak+1980+DO5| isbn = 3-540-00238-3}}</ref>\n*[[Russian-American]] singer and songwriter [[Regina Spektor]] recites a verse from \"Black Spring\", a 1912 poem by Pasternak in her song \"Apres Moi\" from her album ''[[Begin to Hope]]''.\n*Russian-Dutch [[composer]] [[Fred Momotenko]] (Alfred Momotenko) wrote a companion composition to [[Sergej Rachmaninov]]'s [[All-Night Vigil]] [[Opus number|Op]] 37. based on the eponymous poem from the diptych [[Doktor Zhivago]] [http://www.alfredmomotenko.com/nastrastnoy/ ''Na Strastnoy'']\n\n===Adaptations===\nThe first [[Doctor Zhivago (1965 film)|screen adaptation]] of ''Doctor Zhivago'', adapted by [[Robert Bolt]] and directed by [[David Lean]], appeared in 1965. The film, which toured in the [[roadshow]] tradition, starred [[Omar Sharif]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], and [[Julie Christie]]. Concentrating on the [[love triangle]] aspects of the novel, the film became a worldwide blockbuster, but was unavailable in Russia until [[Perestroika]].\n\nIn 2002, the novel was adapted as a [[Doctor Zhivago (TV serial)|television miniseries]]. Directed by Giacomo Campiotti, the serial starred [[Hans Matheson]], [[Alexandra Maria Lara]], [[Keira Knightley]], and [[Sam Neill]].\n\nThe Russian TV version of 2006, directed by [[Alexander Proshkin]] and starring [[Oleg Menshikov]] as Zhivago, is considered more faithful to Pasternak's novel than David Lean's 1965 film.\n\n==Work==\n\n===Poetry===\n\n====Thoughts on poetry====\nAccording to Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|In Pasternak the 'all-powerful god of detail' always, it seems, revolted against the idea of turning out verse for its own sake or to convey vague personal moods. If 'eternal' themes were to be dealt with yet again, then only by a poet in the true sense of the word \u2013 otherwise he should not have the strength of character to touch them at all. Poetry so tightly packed (till it crunched like ice) or distilled into a solution where 'grains of true prose germinated,' a poetry in which realistic detail cast a genuine spell \u2013 only such poetry was acceptable to Pasternak; but not poetry for which indulgence was required, or for which allowances had to be made \u2013 that is, the kind of ephemeral poetry which is particularly common in an age of literary conformism. [Boris Leonidovich] could weep over the 'purple-gray circle' which glowed above [[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s tormented muse and he never failed to be moved by the terseness of [[Pushkin]]'s sprightly lines, but rhymed slogans about the production of tin cans in the so-called 'poetry' of [[Surkov]] and his like, as well as the outpourings about love in the work of those young poets who only echo each other and the classics \u2013 all this left him cold at best and for the most part made him indignant.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 145\">Ivinskaya (1978), p 145.</ref>}}\n\nFor this reason, Pasternak regularly avoided literary cafes where young poets regularly invited them to read their verse. According to Ivinskaya, \"It was this sort of thing that moved him to say: 'Who started the idea that I love poetry? I can't stand poetry.'\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 145\"/>\n\nAlso according to Ivinskaya, \"'The way they could write!' he once exclaimed \u2013 by 'they' he meant the Russian classics. And immediately afterward, reading or, rather, glancing through some verse in the ''Literary Gazette'': 'Just look how tremendously well they've learned to rhyme! But there's actually nothing there \u2013 it would be better to say it in a news bulletin. What has poetry got to do with this?' By 'they' in this case, he meant the poets writing today.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 146.</ref>\n\n====Translation====\nReluctant to conform to [[Socialist Realism]], Pasternak turned to translation in order to provide for his family. He soon produced acclaimed translations of [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], and [[Nikoloz Baratashvili]]. [[Osip Mandelstam]], however, privately warned him, \"Your collected works will consist of twelve volumes of translations, and only one of your own work.\"<ref name=\"Ivin78\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nIn a 1942 letter, Pasternak declared, \"I am completely opposed to contemporary ideas about translation. The work of Lozinski, Radlova, [[Samuil Marshak|Marshak]], and [[Kornei Chukovsky|Chukovski]] is alien to me, and seems artificial, soulless, and lacking in depth. I share the nineteenth century view of translation as a literary exercise demanding insight of a higher kind than that provided by a merely philological approach.\"<ref name=\"Ivin78\"/>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, Pasternak believed in not being too literal in his translations, which he felt could confuse the meaning of the text. He instead advocated observing each poem from afar to plumb its true depths.<ref name=\"Ivin28\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nPasternak's translations of [[William Shakespeare]] (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''King Henry IV'' (Parts I and II), ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'')<ref>Boris Pasternak, ''I Remember: Sketch for an Autobiography'', Pantheon Books, 1959. p 127.</ref> remain deeply popular with Russian audiences because of their colloquial, modernised dialogues. Pasternak's critics, however, accused him of \"pasternakizing\" Shakespeare. In a 1956 essay, Pasternak wrote, \"Translating Shakespeare is a task which takes time and effort. Once it is undertaken, it is best to divide it into sections long enough for the work to not get stale and to complete one section each day. In thus daily progressing through the text, the translator finds himself reliving the circumstances of the author. Day by day, he reproduces his actions and he is drawn into some of his secrets, not in theory, but practically, by experience.\"<ref>Pasternak, (1959) p 142.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|Whenever [Boris Leonidovich] was provided with literal versions of things which echoed his own thoughts or feelings, it made all the difference and he worked feverishly, turning them into masterpieces. I remember his translating [[Paul Verlaine]] in a burst of enthusiasm like this \u2013 ''[[:s:fr:Art po\u00e9tique (Verlaine)|Art po\u00e9tique (Verlaine)]]'' was after all an expression of his own beliefs about poetry.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 34.</ref>}}\n\nWhile they were both collaborating on translating [[Rabindranath Tagore]] from [[Bengali language|Bengali]] into Russian, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya, \"1) Bring out the theme of the poem, its subject matter, as clearly as possible; 2) tighten up the fluid, non-European form by rhyming internally, not at the end of the lines; 3) use loose, irregular [[Meter (poetry)|meters]], mostly ternary ones. You may allow yourself to use [[assonance]]s.\"<ref name=\"Ivin28\"/>\n\nLater, while she was collaborating with him on a translation of [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval]], Pasternak told Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|Use the literal translation only for the ''meaning'', but do not borrow words as they stand from it: they are absurd and not always comprehensible. Don't translate everything, only what you can manage, and by this means try to make the translation more precise than the original \u2013 an absolute necessity in the case of such a confused, slipshod piece of work.\"<ref name=\"Ivin28\"/>}}\n\nAccording to [[Olga Ivinskaya]], however, translation was not a genuine vocation for Pasternak. She later recalled:\n\n{{quote|One day someone brought him a copy of a British newspaper in which there was a double feature under the title, \"Pasternak Keeps a Courageous Silence.\" It said that if Shakespeare had written in Russian he would have written in the same way he was translated by Pasternak... What a pity, the article continued, that Pasternak published nothing but translations, writing his own work for himself and a small circle of intimate friends. \"What do they mean by saying that my silence is courageous?\" [Boris Leonidovich] commented sadly after reading all this. \"I am silent because I am not printed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 35.</ref>}}\n\n===Music===\nBoris Pasternak was also a composer, and had a promising musical career as a musician ahead of him, had he chosen to pursue it. He came from a musical family: his mother was a concert pianist and a student of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and [[Theodor Leschetizky]], and Pasternak's early impressions were of hearing piano trios in the home. The family had a [[dacha]] (country house) close to one occupied by [[Alexander Scriabin]]; [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] were all visitors to the family home. His father Leonid was a painter who produced one of the most important portraits of Scriabin, and Pasternak wrote many years later of witnessing with great excitement the creation of Scriabin's [[Symphony No. 3 (Scriabin)|Symphony No. 3]] (''The Divine Poem''), in 1903.\n\nPasternak began to compose at the age of 13. The high achievements of his mother discouraged him from becoming a pianist, but \u2013 inspired by Scriabin \u2013 he entered the [[Moscow Conservatory]], but left abruptly in 1910 at the age of twenty, to study philosophy in [[Marburg University]]. Four years later he returned to Moscow, having finally decided on a career in literature, publishing his first book of poems, influenced by [[Alexander Blok]] and the [[Russian Futurists]], the same year.\n\nPasternak's early compositions show the clear influence of Scriabin. His single-movement Piano Sonata of 1909 shows a more mature and individual voice. Nominally in B minor, it moves freely from key to key with frequent changes of key-signature and a chromatic dissonant style that defies easy analysis. Although composed during his time at the Conservatory, the Sonata was composed at Raiki, some 27 miles north-east of Moscow, where Leonid Pasternak had his painting studio and taught his students. (NB. This is not the site of the Pasternak family dacha, now open to the public, in the writers' colony at [[Peredelkino]], which is about 16 miles south-west of the capital.)\n\n==Selected books by Pasternak==\n\n===Poetry collections===\n*''Twin in the Clouds'' (1914)\n*''Over the Barriers'' (1916)\n*''Themes and Variations'' (1917)\n*''[[My Sister, Life]]'' (1922)\n*''On Early Trains'' (1944)\n*''Selected Poems'' (1946)\n*''Poems'' (1954)\n*''When the Weather Clears'' (1959)\n*''In The Interlude: Poems 1945\u20131960'' (1962)\n\n===Books of prose===\n*''Safe Conduct'' (1931)\n*''Second Birth'' (1932)\n*''[[The Last Summer (Pasternak novella)|The Last Summer]]'' (1934)\n*''Childhood'' (1941)\n*''Selected Writings'' (1949)\n*''Collected Works'' (1945)\n*''Goethe's Faust'' (1952)\n*''Essay in Autobiography'' (1956)\n*''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1957)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*[[List of Jewish Nobel laureates]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Boris Pasternak, ''I Remember; Sketches for an Autobiography'', [[Pantheon Books]], 1959.\n* Boris Pasternak. \"Sister, My Life\" Translated by C.

Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers {{math|''n'' \u2265 ''k'' \u2265 0}} and is written <math>\\tbinom{n}{k}.</math> It is the [[coefficient]] of the {{math|''x''<sup>''k''</sup>}} term in the [[polynomial expansion]] of the [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]] [[exponentiation|power]] {{math|(1 + ''x'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}, and it is given by the formula\n\n:<math>\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}.</math>\n\nFor example: \n:<math>\\begin{array}{rcl}(1{+}x)^4&=& \\tbinom 40 x^0 + \\tbinom 41 x^1 + \\tbinom 42 x^2 + \\tbinom 43 x^3 + \\tbinom 44 x^4 \\\\\n&=& 1 + 4x + 6 x^2 + 4x^3+x^4,\n\\end{array}</math>\nwhere <math>\\tbinom 42 =\\tfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6</math>, etc.\n\nArranging the numbers <math>\\tbinom n0, \\tbinom n1, \\ldots,\\tbinom nn</math> in successive rows for <math>n=0,1,2,\\ldots</math> gives a triangular array called [[Pascal's triangle]], satisfying the [[recurrence relation]] <math>\\tbinom nk = \\tbinom{n-1}{k} + \\tbinom{n-1}{k-1}</math>.\n\nThe binomial coefficients occur in many areas of mathematics, especially [[combinatorics]].\nThe symbol <math>\\tbinom{n}{k}</math> is usually read as \"{{math|''n''}} choose {{math|''k''}}\" because there are <math>\\tbinom{n}{k}</math> ways to choose an (unordered) subset of {{math|''k''}} elements from a fixed set of {{math|''n''}} elements. For example, there are <math>\\tbinom 42=6</math> ways to choose 2 elements from <math>\\{1,2,3,4\\}</math>, namely <math>\\{1,2\\}</math>, <math>\\{1,3\\}</math>, <math>\\{1,4\\}</math>, <math>\\{2,3\\}</math>, <math>\\{2,4\\}</math>, <math>\\{3,4\\}</math>.\n\nMany properties of <math>\\tbinom nk</math> also apply to the generalized binomial coefficients <math>\\tbinom zk</math> for any complex number ''z'' and integer ''k'' &ge; 0.\n\n==History and notation==\n\n[[Andreas von Ettingshausen]] introduced the notation <math>\\tbinom nk</math> in 1826,<ref>{{harvtxt|Higham|1998}}</ref> although the numbers were known centuries earlier (see [[Pascal's triangle]]). The earliest known detailed discussion of binomial coefficients is in a tenth-century commentary, by [[Halayudha]], on an ancient [[Sanskrit]] text, [[Pingala]]'s ''Chanda\u1e25\u015b\u0101stra''.  In about 1150, the Indian mathematician [[Bhaskaracharya]] gave an exposition of binomial coefficients in his book ''[[L\u012bl\u0101vat\u012b]]''.<ref>[[Lilavati]] Section 6, Chapter 4 (see {{harvtxt|Knuth|1997}}).</ref>\n\nAlternative notations include {{math|''C''(''n'', ''k'')}}, {{math|<sub>''n''</sub>''C''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, {{math|<sup>''n''</sup>''C''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, {{math|1=''C''<sup>''k''</sup><sub style=\"position:relative; left:-.5em;\">''n''</sub>}}, {{math|1=''C''<sup>''n''</sup><sub style=\"position:relative; left:-.5em;\">''k''</sub>}}, and {{math|''C''<sub>''n'',''k''</sub>}} in all of which the {{math|''C''}} stands for ''[[combination]]s'' or ''choices''. Many calculators use variants of the {{nowrap|{{math|''C''}} notation}} because they can represent it on a single-line display.  In this form the binomial coefficients are easily compared to [[permutation#k-permutations of n|{{math|''k''}}-permutations of {{math|''n''}}]], written as {{math|''P''(''n'', ''k'')}}, etc.\n\n== Definition and interpretations ==\nFor [[natural number]]s (taken to include 0) ''n'' and ''k'', the binomial coefficient <math>\\tbinom nk</math> can be defined as the [[coefficient]] of the [[monomial]] ''X''<sup>''k''</sup> in the expansion of {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}. The same coefficient also occurs (if {{nowrap|''k'' \u2264 ''n''}}) in the [[binomial formula]]\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>(x+y)^n=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom nk x^{n-k}y^k</math>|{{EquationRef|\u2217}}}}\n(valid for any elements ''x'',''y'' of a [[commutative ring]]),\nwhich explains the name \"binomial coefficient\".\n\nAnother occurrence of this number is in combinatorics, where it gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that ''k'' objects can be chosen from among ''n'' objects; more formally, the number of ''k''-element subsets (or ''k''-[[combination]]s) of an ''n''-element set. This number can be seen as equal to the one of the first definition, independently of any of the formulas below to compute it: if in each of the ''n'' factors of the power {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')<sup>''n''</sup>}} one temporarily labels the term ''X'' with an index ''i'' (running from 1 to ''n''), then each subset of ''k'' indices gives after expansion a contribution ''X''<sup>''k''</sup>, and the coefficient of that monomial in the result will be the number of such subsets. This shows in particular that <math>\\tbinom nk</math> is a natural number for any natural numbers ''n'' and ''k''. There are many other combinatorial interpretations of binomial coefficients (counting problems for which the answer is given by a binomial coefficient expression), for instance the number of words formed of ''n'' [[bit]]s (digits 0 or 1) whose sum is ''k'' is given by <math>\\tbinom nk</math>, while the number of ways to write <math>k=a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n</math> where every ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> is a nonnegative integer is given by <math>\\tbinom{n+k-1}{n-1}</math>. Most of these interpretations are easily seen to be equivalent to counting ''k''-combinations.\n\n== Computing the value of binomial coefficients ==\nSeveral methods exist to compute the value of <math>\\tbinom nk</math> without actually expanding a binomial power or counting ''k''-combinations.\n\n=== Recursive formula ===\nOne method uses the [[recursion|recursive]], purely additive, formula\n\n:<math>  \\binom nk = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}k \\quad \\text{for all integers }n,k : 1\\le k\\le n-1,</math>\n\nwith initial/boundary values\n\n:<math>\\binom n0 = \\binom nn = 1 \\quad \\text{for all integers } n\\ge0,</math>\n\nThe formula follows from considering the set {1,2,3,\u2026,''n''} and counting separately (a) the ''k''-element groupings that include a particular set element, say \"''i''\", in every group (since \"''i''\" is already chosen to fill one spot in every group, we need only choose ''k''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 from the remaining ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1) and (b) all the ''k''-groupings that don't include \"''i''\"; this enumerates all the possible ''k''-combinations of ''n'' elements. It also follows from tracing the contributions to ''X''<sup>''k''</sup> in {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>(1 + ''X'')}}. As there is zero ''X''<sup>''n''+1</sup> or ''X''<sup>&minus;1</sup> in {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}, one might extend the definition beyond the above boundaries to include <math>\\tbinom nk</math>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 when either ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''n'' or ''k''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0. This recursive formula then allows the construction of [[Pascal's triangle]], surrounded by white spaces where the zeros, or the trivial coefficients, would be.\n\n=== Multiplicative formula ===\nA more efficient method to compute individual binomial coefficients is given by the formula\n\n:<math>\\binom nk = \\frac{n^{\\underline{k}}}{k!} = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-(k-1))}{k(k-1)(k-2)\\cdots 1}=\\prod_{i=1}^k \\frac{n+1-i}{i},</math>\n\nwhere the numerator of the first fraction <math>n^{\\underline{k}}</math> is expressed as a [[falling factorial power]].\nThis formula is easiest to understand for the combinatorial interpretation of binomial coefficients.\nThe numerator gives the number of ways to select a sequence of ''k'' distinct objects, retaining the order of selection, from a set of ''n'' objects. The denominator counts the number of distinct sequences that define the same ''k''-combination when order is disregarded.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the binomial coefficient with regard to ''k'' and ''n''\u2212''k'', calculation may be optimised by setting the upper limit of the product above to the smaller of ''k'' and ''n''\u2212''k''.\n\n=== Factorial formula ===\nFinally, though computationally unsuitable, there is the compact form, often used in proofs and derivations, which makes repeated use of the familiar [[factorial]] function:\n\n:<math> \\binom nk = \\frac{n!}{k!\\,(n-k)!} \\quad \\text{for }\\ 0\\leq k\\leq n,</math>\n\nwhere ''n''! denotes the factorial of ''n''. This formula follows from the multiplicative formula above by multiplying numerator and denominator by {{nowrap|(''n'' \u2212 ''k'')!}}; as a consequence it involves many factors common to numerator and denominator.  It is less practical for explicit computation (in the case that ''k'' is small and ''n'' is large) unless common factors are first cancelled (in particular since factorial values grow very rapidly). The formula does exhibit a symmetry that is less evident from the multiplicative formula (though it is from the definitions)\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\binom nk = \\binom n{n-k} \\quad \\text{for }\\ 0\\leq k\\leq n,</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhich leads to a more efficient multiplicative computational routine.

It can be deduced from this that <math>\\tbinom n k</math> is divisible by ''n''/[[greatest common divisor|gcd]](''n'',''k''). In particular therefore it follows that ''p'' divides <math>\\tbinom{p^r}{s}</math> for all positive integers ''r'' and ''s'' such that ''s''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''p''<sup>''r''</sup>. However this is not true of higher powers of ''p'': for example 9 does not divide <math>\\tbinom{9}{6}</math>.\n\nA somewhat surprising result by [[David Singmaster]] (1974) is that any integer divides [[almost all]] binomial coefficients. More precisely, fix an integer ''d'' and let ''f''(''N'') denote the number of binomial coefficients <math>\\tbinom n k</math> with ''n'' < ''N'' such that ''d'' divides <math>\\tbinom n k</math>.

The behavior is quite complex, and markedly different in various octants (that is, with respect to the ''x'' and ''y'' axes and the line <math>y=x</math>), with the behavior for negative ''x'' having singularities at negative integer values and a checkerboard of positive and negative regions:\n* in the octant <math>0 \\leq y \\leq x</math> it is a smoothly interpolated form of the usual binomial, with a ridge (\"Pascal's ridge\").\n* in the octant <math>0 \\leq x \\leq y</math> and in the quadrant <math>x \\geq 0, y \\leq 0</math> the function is close to zero.\n* in the quadrant <math>x \\leq 0, y \\geq 0</math> the function is alternatingly very large positive and negative on the parallelograms with vertices \n:<math>(-n,m+1), (-n,m), (-n-1,m-1), (-n-1,m)</math>\n* in the octant <math>0 > x > y</math> the behavior is again alternatingly very large positive and negative, but on a square grid.\n* in the octant <math>-1 > y > x + 1</math> it is close to zero, except for near the singularities.\n\n=== Generalization to ''q''-series ===\nThe binomial coefficient has a [[q-analog]] generalization known as the [[Gaussian binomial coefficient]].\n\n=== Generalization to infinite cardinals ===\nThe definition of the binomial coefficient can be generalized to [[Cardinal Number|infinite cardinals]] by defining:\n\n:<math>{\\alpha \\choose \\beta} = | \\{ B \\subseteq A : |B| = \\beta \\} |</math>\n\nwhere A is some set with [[cardinality]] <math>\\alpha</math>. One can show that the generalized binomial coefficient is well-defined, in the sense that no matter what set we choose to represent the cardinal number <math>\\alpha</math>, <math>{\\alpha \\choose \\beta}</math> will remain the same. For finite cardinals, this definition coincides with the standard definition of the binomial coefficient.\n\nAssuming the [[Axiom of Choice]], one can show that <math>{\\alpha \\choose \\alpha} = 2^{\\alpha}</math> for any infinite cardinal <math>\\alpha</math>.\n\n==Binomial coefficient in programming languages==\nThe notation <math> {n \\choose k} </math> is convenient in handwriting but inconvenient for [[typewriter]]s and [[computer terminal]]s. Many [[programming language]]s do not offer a standard [[subroutine]] for computing the binomial coefficient, but for example both the [[APL programming language]] and the (related) [[J programming language]] use the exclamation mark:  k ! n .\n\nNaive implementations of the factorial formula, such as the following snippet in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\nfrom math import factorial\ndef binomialCoefficient(n, k):\n    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nare very slow and are useless for calculating factorials of very high numbers (in languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]] they suffer from overflow errors because of this reason). A direct implementation of the multiplicative formula works well:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\ndef binomialCoefficient(n, k):\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    k = min(k, n - k) # take advantage of symmetry\n    c = 1\n    for i in range(k):\n        c = c * (n - i) / (i + 1)\n    return c\n</syntaxhighlight>\n(In Python, range(k) produces a list from 0 to k\u20131.)\n\n[[Pascal's rule]] provides a recursive definition which can also be implemented in Python, although it is less efficient:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\ndef binomialCoefficient(n, k):\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    if k > n - k: # take advantage of symmetry\n        k = n - k\n    if k == 0 or n <= 1:\n    \treturn 1\n    return binomialCoefficient(n-1, k) + binomialCoefficient(n-1, k-1)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe example mentioned above can be also written in functional style. The following [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] example uses the recursive definition\n:<math>{n \\choose k+1} = \\frac{n-k}{k+1} {n \\choose k} </math>\nRational arithmetic can be easily avoided using integer division\n:<math>{n \\choose k+1} = \\left[(n-k) {n \\choose k}\\right] \\div (k+1) </math>\nThe following implementation uses all these ideas\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"scheme\">\n(define (binomial n k)\n;; Helper function to compute C(n,k) via forward recursion\n  (define (binomial-iter n k i prev)\n    (if (>= i k)\n      prev\n     (binomial-iter n k (+ i 1) (/ (* (- n i) prev) (+ i 1)))))\n;; Use symmetry property C(n,k)=C(n, n-k)\n  (if (< k (-  n k))\n    (binomial-iter n k 0 1)\n    (binomial-iter n (- n k) 0 1)))\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nWhen computing <math>\\textstyle {n \\choose k+1} = \\left[(n-k) {n \\choose k}\\right] \\div (k+1) </math> in a language with fixed-length integers, the multiplication by <math>(n-k)</math> may overflow even when the result would fit. The overflow can be avoided by dividing first and fixing the result using the remainder:\n:<math>{n \\choose k+1} = \\left[\\textstyle {n \\choose k} \\div (k+1)\\right](n-k) + {\\left[{n\\choose k}\\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ (k+1)\\right](n-k) \\over (k+1)}</math>\n\nImplementation in the C language:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\" start=\"1\">\n#include <limits.h>\n\nunsigned long binomial(unsigned long n, unsigned long k) {\n  unsigned long c = 1, i;\n  \n  if (k > n-k) // take advantage of symmetry\n    k = n-k;\n  \n  for (i = 1; i <= k; i++, n--) {\n    if (c/i > UINT_MAX/n) // return 0 on overflow\n      return 0;\n      \n    c = c / i * n + c % i * n / i;  // split c * n / i into (c / i * i + c % i) * n / i\n  }\n  \n  return c;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAnother way to compute the binomial coefficient when using large numbers is to recognize that\n\n:<math>\n  {n \\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!\\,(n-k)!} = \\frac{\\Gamma(n+1)}{\\Gamma(k+1)\\,\\Gamma(n-k+1)} = \\exp(\\ln\\Gamma(n+1)-\\ln\\Gamma(k+1)-\\ln\\Gamma(n-k+1)),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\ln</math>&thinsp;<math>\\Gamma(n)</math> denotes the [[natural logarithm]] of the [[gamma function]] at <math>n</math>. It is a special function that is easily computed and is standard in some programming languages such as using ''log_gamma'' in [[Maxima (software)|Maxima]], ''LogGamma'' in [[Mathematica]], ''gammaln'' in [[MATLAB]] and Python's [[SciPy]] module, ''lngamma'' in [[PARI/GP]] or ''lgamma'' in C, [[R (programming language)|R]],<ref>{{cite book |first=Victor A. |last=Bloomfield |title=Using R for Numerical Analysis in Science and Engineering |location= |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-4987-8662-1 |year=2016 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfEbDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 }}</ref> and [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]].

While majoring in illustration and visual design at [[Auburn University]], Holbrook served as art director of the student newspaper, doing editorial cartoons and a weekly comic strip. At the same time, his work was being published in the ''[[Huntsville Times]]'' and the ''[[Amasa Coleman Lee|Monroe Journal]]''. After graduation in 1980, he joined the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'' as an editorial staff artist.\n\nDuring a 1982 visit to relatives on the West Coast, Holbrook met ''[[Peanuts]]'' creator, [[Charles Schulz]]. Following his advice and encouragement, Holbrook created a strip in the fall of that year about a college graduate working in a rundown diner. It did not stir syndicate interest, but what he learned on the strip helped him when he created ''On the Fastrack''.\n\nEleven days before ''On the Fastrack'' made its syndicated debut (March 19, 1984), Holbrook met Teri Peitso on a blind date. They were married on [[Pearl Harbor Day]], 1985. They have two daughters, Chandler and Haviland. Peitso-Holbrook's novels have been nominated for both [[Edgar Award]]s and [[Agatha Award]]s. She is currently an assistant professor in literacy education at [[Georgia State University]]. The family lives in the [[Atlanta]] area.\n\nIn October 1989, Holbrook began his second strip, ''[[Safe Havens]]'', and his third strip, ''[[Kevin and Kell]]'' was launched in September 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onthefastrack.com/?page_id=198|title=On the Fastrack by Bill Holbrook - About|accessdate=2014-04-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228080119/http://www.onthefastrack.com/?page_id=198|archivedate=2014-02-28|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Comic strips==\nEvery week Holbrook writes the story line for the next three weeks for one of his strips and draws the next three weeks' worth of strips for another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comixtalk.com/ten_questions_with_bill_holbrook_of_kevin_and_kell|title=Ten Questions with Bill Holbrook of Kevin and Kell|publisher=Comixtalk|date=October 2004|accessdate=2007-12-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012100238/http://comixtalk.com/ten_questions_with_bill_holbrook_of_kevin_and_kell|archivedate=2008-10-12|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Geusz|first=Phil|url=http://www.anthrozine.com/itvw/itv.holbrook.html|title=Guess who's coming to dinner?

Following an endorsement by horror writer [[Stephen King]], the film slowly began to receive distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/bruce-campbell-toasts-stephen-king-for-helping-get-evil-dead-2-made|title=Bruce Campbell Toasts Stephen King For Helping Get Evil Dead 2 Made|work=SyFyWire|last=Grossberg|first=Josh|date=February 22, 2018|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}</ref> Four years following its original release, it became the number one movie in the UK.

Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play [[musical instrument]]s, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a [[misnomer]]. However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.\n\nSome such bands form on their own. They can evolve out of church choral or [[gospel music]] groups, but are often created by [[talent manager]]s or record producers who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards a female audience of [[preteen]]s, [[teenybopper]]s, or teens, the term may be used with negative connotations in [[music journalism]]. Boy bands are similar in concept to their counterparts, [[girl group]]s. Boy bands' popularity peaked four times: in the 1960s (e.g., [[The Jackson 5]]), in the 1990s and early 2000s when acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]], [[NSYNC|*NSYNC]], [[A1 (band)|A1]] and [[Westlife]], among others, dominated the top of the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' and pop charts, in the early 2010s with the emergence of new boy bands such as [[JLS]], [[Big Time Rush (band)|Big Time Rush]] and [[One Direction]], and in the late 2010s with pop groups such as [[BTS (band)|BTS]] and [[5 Seconds of Summer]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe earliest forerunner of boy band music began in the late 19th century as [[a cappella]] [[barbershop quartets]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barbershop.org/web/groups/public/documents/pages/pub_cb_00016.hcsp |title=Definition of the Barbershop Style, from the Contest and Judging Handbook |date=July 11, 2002 |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |publisher=Barbershop Harmony Society |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607170531/http://www.barbershop.org/web/groups/public/documents/pages/pub_cb_00016.hcsp |archivedate=June 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> They were usually a group of males and sang in [[Four-part harmony|four-part harmonies]]. Barbershop quartets were popular into the earlier part of the 20th century. A revival of the male vocal group took place in the late 1940s and 1950s with the use of [[doo-wop]] music. Doo-wop bands sang about topics such as love and other themes used in [[pop music]]. The earliest traces of boy bands were in the mid-1950s although the term boy band was not used. [[African American]] vocal group [[The Ink Spots]] was one of the first of what would now be called boy bands. The term boy band was not established until the late 1980s as before that they were called male vocal groups or \"hep harmony singing groups\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://didyouknow.org/boybands/ |title=Boy bands |publisher=Did you know |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlthough generally described as a rock band, the highest-selling band in history [[The Beatles]] are considered by a number or journalists \"the first\" or \"the original\" boyband, \"before anyone had thought of the term.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/faintings-stage-invasions-how-the-beatles-invented-the-cult-of-f/ |title=Faintings, stage invasions: how the Beatles invented the cult of female fandom |last=Brown |first=Mick |date=September 6, 2016 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=The Liverpool quartet known as [[The Beatles]] were not only the quintessential rock band, but many considered John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Star to be the original boy band -- especially in the early 1960s when young girls would scream at the top of their lungs and pass out upon first sight of the \u201cFab Four.|author=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''<ref name=\"THR\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/boy-bands-wanted-one-direction-nsync-beatles-backstreet-boys-306859/1-the-beatles |title=The Beatles to The Wanted: The Evolution of Boy Bands |last=Medina |first=Portia|last2=Hermon|first2=James|last3=James |first3=Kyleen |date=April 4, 2012 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=March 13, 2018}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Beatles inspired the decision to produce the 1966 television series ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'',<ref name=\"Star Tribune\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/from-beatles-to-the-wanted-a-history-of-boy-bands-at-a-glance/215232031/ |title=From Beatles to the Wanted: A history of boy bands at a glance |last=Tillotson |first=Kristin |date=July 15, 2013 |work=[[Star Tribune]] |access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref> which spawned [[The Monkees|the music group of the same name]], formed by the four starring actors.

For instance, their music featured [[close harmony|close harmonies]] from [[soul music]] and catchy pop hooks influenced as much as they were by [[Motown]] and acts like [[the Supremes]]. The group also incorporated choreographed dance moves to their performances. All members of the band sang, which is a common convention of a boy band, as opposed to having a front man and the rest on instruments; thus, no one person dominated the stage.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Also a sibilings group, The Osmonds first started singing [[barbershop music]] for local audiences, before being hired to perform at [[Disneyland]] early in their career. Their appearance in a televised Disney special earned them additional TV spots, such as ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'' and ''[[The Jerry Lewis Show]]''.<ref name=\"THR\"/>\n\n===Late 1970s and 1980s: Menudo, New Edition, and New Kids on the Block===\nOther antecedents (apart from those already mentioned) exist throughout the history of pop music. The genre has been copied into languages and cultures other than the Anglo-American. The Puerto Rican boy band [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], appealing to young [[Latina]] audiences, was founded in 1977. Menudo had a convention unique among boy bands: when a member turned 16, became too tall, or their voice changed, they were replaced.  The members of Menudo were generally aged 12\u201316.\n\nThe [[Bay City Rollers]] were a [[Scotland|Scottish]] pop band who were most popular in the mid-1970s. The ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' noted that they were \"[[tartan]] teen sensations from [[Edinburgh]]\", and were \"the first of many acts heralded as the 'Biggest Group since [[The Beatles]]' and one of the most screamed-at teeny-bopper acts of the 1970s\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums|edition= 19th|publisher= Guinness World Records |location= London|isbn= 1-904994-10-5|page = 45}}</ref>  For a fairly brief but fervent period (nicknamed \"Rollermania\"), they were worldwide [[teen idol]]s.  The group were one of the first bands, like The Monkees before them, to take the formula shown by The Beatles and apply it to a teen market. The group achieved the same amount of success but for a limited period of time. At the peak of their popularity in the UK, comparisons were being made to The Beatles. Also by this time, Bay City Roller [[fan (person)|fans]] had a completely distinctive style of dress, the main elements of which were ankle-length [[tartan]] trousers and tartan [[scarf|scarves]], the group using the benefit of merchandise and promotion.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book| first= Martin C | last = Strong| year = 2000| title = The Great Rock Discography | edition = 5th|publisher= Mojo |location= Edinburgh|pages= 2\u20133|isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]-based [[power pop]] group [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]] was generally interpreted as a \"teen act\", although all the band members played their own music. Vocalist [[Eric Carmen]] later commented, \"It was not hip for people to like us, because their little sister liked us.\"<ref>{{Citation | last = Knopper | first = Steve | contribution = Raspberries | title = Contemporary Musicians | publisher = Gale | year = 2004 | series = Encyclopedia | accessdate = December 26, 2009 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/}}</ref>\n\nBoston group [[New Edition]] was formed in 1978 and reached their height of popularity in the 1980s, meaning they are often credited for starting the boy-band trend, even though the term \"boy band\" did not exist until the 1990s. [[Maurice Starr]] was influenced by New Edition and popularized it with his [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] [[New Kids on the Block]], the first commercially successful modern boy band, who formed in 1984 and found international success in 1988. Starr's idea was to take the traditional template from the R&B genre (in this case his teenage band New Edition) and apply it to a pop genre.\n\n[[Bros]] (abbreviation of the word \"brothers\") were a British boy band active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, consisting of twin brothers [[Matt Goss|Matt]] and [[Luke Goss]] along with [[Craig Logan]]. Formed in 1986, they scored multiple top 10 hits between 1987 and 1989 and in 1988 became the first modern era\u2013style boy band to have a multiple platinum-selling album in Britain, with ''[[Push (Bros album)|Push]]'', still one of the most successful boy-band albums in the UK. Other big boy bands in Britain during the late 1980s were [[Big Fun (boyband)|Big Fun]] and [[Brother Beyond]].\n\n===1990s: Boyz II Men, Take That, Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Westlife===\nSome managers in Europe soon created their own acts after being inspired by [[New Kids on the Block]], beginning with [[Nigel Martin-Smith]]'s [[Take That]] in the UK (formed in 1990) and followed by [[Tom Watkins (music manager)|Tom Watkins]], who had success with [[Bros]] in the late 1980s and formed [[East 17]] in 1991. Bros were marketed and pitted against Take That as rivals with a harsher attitude, style and sound. Since reforming in 2006 after a decade-long hiatus, Take That have become one of the most successful groups in British music chart history and their albums and singles have also charted internationally, especially in Europe. Irish music manager [[Louis Walsh]], who had witnessed the impact of these British boy bands, put out an advert for an \"Irish Take That\", thereby creating [[Boyzone]] in 1993. [[Let Loose]] (formed in 1993), [[MN8]] and [[911 (UK band)|911]] (formed in 1995), and [[Damage (British band)|Damage]] (formed in 1996) were also successful boy bands in Britain; however, by the late 1990s all these bands had run their course and split up.\n\nAll these artists were very successful on both the singles and albums charts domestically and internationally; however, with the emergence of [[Britpop]] and the commercial co-option of [[indie rock]], many boy bands were ridiculed by the British music press as having no artistic credibility, although some, such as East 17 and Take That, did write most of their own material. The media attention was then placed on the \"Battle of Britpop\", and the bands [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]] replaced the importance and rivalry of Take That and East 17 as the two new biggest bands in Britain. However, boy bands continued to find success in the late 1990s, such as [[Five (band)|Five]], [[Another Level (band)|Another Level]], [[Point Break (band)|Point Break]] and [[Westlife]]. In 1995 successful German music manager [[Frank Farian]], who had been manager of [[Boney M]] and [[Milli Vanilli]], put together [[Latin American]] band [[No Mercy (pop band)|No Mercy]] who scored a few worldwide hits during the mid-90s.\n\nAlthough being American and the sons of [[Tito Jackson]], a member of [[The Jackson 5]], [[3T]] had several hits singles across Europe in the mid-1990s, despite limited success in the US, and finished the second biggest selling act of 1996 in Europe behind [[Spice Girls]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.sortmusic.com/_0/3t-biography,len.html |title=3T Biography |publisher=Sort music |accessdate=August 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the success of North American boy bands like [[New Kids on the Block]] in East Asia, Japanese entertainment company [[Johnny & Associates]] formed [[SMAP]] in 1992.

Continuing this success in the mid-1990s, most prominent boy bands were African American and had R&B and gospel elements, such as the groups [[All-4-One]] (formed in 1993) and [[Boyz II Men]] (formed in 1988). Boyz II Men are also the most successful boy band act on the [[U.S. Hot 100]] as well as the [[Australian Singles Chart]]. Although they had success on the Billboard charts, they were not marketed towards youth but more towards adults. It was not until 1997 and the change to pop-oriented groups such as [[Backstreet Boys]], [[98 Degrees]], [[NSYNC]], [[The Moffatts]], and [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] that boy bands exploded commercially and dominated the market in the United States. This late 1990s marked the height of boy band popularity in North America, which hasn't been seen since.\n\nArguably the most successful boy band manager from the U.S. was [[Lou Pearlman]], who founded commercially successful acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] in 1993, [[NSYNC]] and [[LFO (group)|LFO]] in 1995, [[O-Town (band)|O-Town]] in 2000, and [[US5]] in 2005. Backstreet Boys and NSYNC became the two biggest boy bands in the late 1990s until the early 2000s, and Backstreet Boys went on to tie [[The Jackson 5]] as the best-selling boy bands in history with over 100 million records sold.<ref name=\"bsb\"/>\n\nIn the late 1990s in the UK, producer [[Simon Cowell]] (noted in the U.S. for the ''American Idol/X Factor'' franchise) is also known for having managed British boyband [[Five (band)|Five]] (formed in 1997) and Irish boyband [[Westlife]] (formed in 1998). Westlife was created by Irishman [[Louis Walsh]] as a replacement for [[Boyzone]]<ref>{{cite web| url = http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/x-factor/judges/louis-walsh.html | work = Press Association | title = Louis Walsh Profile | publisher= Yahoo! |accessdate= January 9, 2010}}</ref> and was initially managed by a former member of the band [[Ronan Keating]]. Westlife would eventually overtake Take That in number one's tally in the UK although Take That's overall UK sales are still higher. In 2012, the [[Official Charts Company]] revealed the biggest selling singles artists in British music chart history with Take That placed 15th overall and the highest selling boyband act (9.3 million), followed by Boyzone at 29 (7.1 million) and Westlife at 34 (6.8 million).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-20-biggest-selling-groups-of-all-time-revealed-1682/ | title = The Official Top 20 biggest selling groups of all time revealed!|publisher=Official charts |accessdate=November 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-singles-charts-biggest-selling-artists-of-all-time-revealed-1431/ |title=Official Singles Charts' biggest selling artists of all time revealed | publisher =Official charts |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/take-thats-top-40-biggest-selling-songs-3313/ | title = Take That's Top 40 Biggest Selling Songs|publisher=Official charts |accessdate=November 29, 2014}}</ref> Even though Cowell is known to have managed several successful boy bands, he is also infamous for passing on signing two of the biggest boybands to emerge from the 1990s and 2000s, Take That and [[Busted (band)|Busted]].<ref>{{cite news| first =Alasdair | last = Glennie |url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2118414/Simon-Cowell-admits-turned-Take-That-overweight-Gary-Barlow.html | title =Simon Cowell admits that he turned down Take That because of 'overweight' Gary Barlow |work=Daily Mail |date = March 22, 2012 |accessdate=June 29, 2012 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bebo.com/BlogView.jsp?MemberId=7322368642&BlogId=7651779757 |title=Blog |publisher=Bebo |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2000s: Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, Westlife, Jonas Brothers and F4===\n[[File:JonasBrothers.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jonas Brothers]] are described as pop boy band]]\nWith the continued success of [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[NSYNC|*NSYNC]], American and British groups like [[98 Degrees]], [[Westlife]], [[O-Town (band)|O-Town]], [[A1 (band)|A1]], [[Blue (English band)|Blue]], and [[Busted (band)|Busted]] gained quick popularity both domestically and internationally.

In the Philippines, a major boy band has been formed by bringing the first reality boy band search of the country called [[Pinoy Boyband Superstar]] which held mid [[Pinoy Boyband Superstar|2016]], after all the series of auditions, rigorous training and competition, the winners formed as a group called [[Boyband PH]] a five-piece Pinoy boy band which managed by [[Star Magic]]<ref>{{cite news|title='Pinoy Boyband Superstar': Winners revealed!|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/155190-pinoy-boyband-superstar-winners|accessdate=December 11, 2016|publisher=Rappler|date=December 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn South Korea, boy bands have been commercially successful. On the [[Gaon Music Chart]] year-end albums chart of 2016, nine of the top 10 and 17 of the top 20 albums are by boy bands or by subunits/members of boy bands. [[BIGBANG]], [[EXO (band)|EXO]] had the second and third best-selling albums. Other boy bands with albums in the yearly top 20 of 2016 are [[BTS (band)|BTS]], [[SHINee]], [[GOT7]], [[Seventeen (band)|Seventeen]], [[Infinite (band)|INFINITE]] and [[VIXX]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T&serviceGbn=&targetTime=2016&hitYear=2016&termGbn=year|title= 2016\ub144 Album Chart|accessdate= January 13, 2017|work= gaonchart.co.kr|language= Korean}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan, [[Arashi]] continue to be very successful, being the [[2016 in Japanese music#Artists|best-selling music artist in Japan in 2016 by value of sales]]<ref name=\"oricon\">{{cite web |url= http://www.oricon.co.jp/special/49664/6/|title= \u30102016\u5e74 \u5e74\u9593\u97f3\u697d\uff06\u6620\u50cf\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3011\u5d50\u304c\u524d\u4eba\u672a\u5230\u306e\u8a18\u9332\u9054\u6210\uff01AKB48\u304c\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u5e74\u9593V7!!|date= December 24, 2016|accessdate= January 4, 2017|work= Oricon Style|publisher= [[Oricon]]|language= Japanese}}</ref> and also having the yearly best-selling album in the country in 2015<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oricon.co.jp/special/48546/4/|title= 2015\u5e74 \u5e74\u9593\u97f3\u697d\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u767a\u8868\uff01|date= December 23, 2015|accessdate= January 4, 2017|work= Oricon Style|publisher= [[Oricon]]|language= Japanese}}</ref> and 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oricon.co.jp/special/49664/4/|title= \u30102016\u5e74 \u5e74\u9593\u97f3\u697d\uff06\u6620\u50cf\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3011\u5d50\u304c\u524d\u4eba\u672a\u5230\u306e\u8a18\u9332\u9054\u6210\uff01AKB48\u304c\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u5e74\u9593V7!!|date= December 24, 2016|accessdate= January 4, 2017|work= Oricon Style|publisher= [[Oricon]]|language= Japanese}}</ref> Other successful Japanese boy bands in this decade include [[Sandaime J Soul Brothers]], the second best-selling music artist of 2016 in the country<ref name=\"oricon\"/> and [[Kanjani Eight]], the fifth best-selling music artist of that year in Japan.<ref name=\"oricon\"/>\n\n==Key factors of the concept==\nSeen as important to a \"boy band\" group's commercial success is the group's [[Reputation|image]], carefully controlled by managing all aspects of the group's attire,  promotional materials (which are frequently supplied to [[teen magazine]]s), and music videos. The key factor of a boy band is being trendy. This means that the band conforms to the most recent fashion and musical trends in the popular music scene. Typically, each member of the group will have some distinguishing feature and be portrayed as having a particular personality stereotype, such as \"the baby,\" \"the bad boy,\" or \"the shy one.\"  While managing the portrayal of popular musicians is as old as [[popular music]], the particular pigeonholing of band members is a defining characteristic of boy and girl bands.\n\nIn most cases, their music is written, arranged and produced by a producer who works with the band at all times and controls the group's sound \u2013 if necessary, to the point of hiring [[session singers]] to record guide vocals for each member of the group to sing individually if the members cannot harmonize well together. However, for clarity of each voice, recording each voice individually is most commonly the norm with most modern vocal groups.  In recent years [[auto-tune]] has become a popular tool for boy bands who are unable to sing to a high standard. Some boy bands have come under fire for this issue of using auto-tune. Some have also come under fire for [[lip syncing]] in their performances as well, for example [[New Kids on the Block]].<ref>{{cite web | title = New Kids' Performance Was Dubbed, Critic Says | url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-03-04/news/9203040523_1_mcpherson-new-kids-starr |publisher = Orlando Sentinel | accessdate =August 15, 2012|date=March 4, 1992}}</ref>\n\nA typical boy band performance features elaborately choreographed dancing, with the members taking turns singing and/or rapping. Boy bands generally do not compose or produce their own material, unless the members lobby hard enough for creative control. However, some bands were created around the talent of a songwriter within the group like [[Gary Barlow]] of [[Take That]] or [[Tony Mortimer]] of [[East 17]]. It is not uncommon to find extra songs on an album written by one or more of the band members; however, their producers rarely use these as singles.\n\nSince the 21st century, however, boy bands have been expected to write or at least contribute in some part lyrically to songs. Apart from the groups mentioned above who all had at least one primary songwriter from their beginning, other groups soon caught up.  From the late nineties, members of [[Backstreet Boys]] who had previously used writers like [[Max Martin]] during their early albums began writing their own songs. Newer groups from late 2000s such as [[JLS]] have all made a point from early interviews that they write their own songs and hold their own image as this is an important part of marketing. Some bands like [[The Wanted]] have even spent time learning the craft of songwriting.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a329584/the-wanted-go-to-songwriting-camp-to-write-new-album.html |title=The Wanted go to songwriting camp to write new album |work=Digital Spy |date=July 13, 2011 | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIndividuals can also go on to achieve greater success as a solo artist coming out of a boy band having used the groups popularity to build on. Usually this signals the end of the group until potential future reunions. Examples of this include [[Michael Jackson]] from [[The Jackson 5]], [[Donny Osmond]] from [[The Osmonds]], [[Ricky Martin]] from [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Justin Timberlake]] from *NSYNC, and [[Ronan Keating]] from [[Boyzone]]. Sometimes the most successful solo star from a band is not the most popular member such as [[Robbie Williams]] as opposed to lead singer [[Gary Barlow]] from [[Take That]]. Some boy band members have gone on to successful careers elsewhere in the media. [[Michael Dolenz]] of [[The Monkees]] went on to become a successful television producer, working for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] franchises such as [[LWT]] and [[Television South]].\n\n==Music genres==\nAlthough most boy bands consist of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] or pop influences, other [[music genre]]s, most notably [[country music]] and [[folk music]], are also represented. [[South 65]] and [[Marshall Dyllon]], for example, were both country music boy bands. [[Il Divo]], created by [[Simon Cowell]] in 2004, are a vocal group that performs [[operatic pop]] in several (mainly Italian) languages. Since then operatic/classical boy bands have become quite popular and common, especially in the UK. Since 2001 there has been some crossover with [[power pop]] and [[pop punk]] from bands that play live instruments. Just recently some boy bands decided to go back to their original doo-wop roots, most notably, [[The Overtones]].\n\n==Controversy==\nSince the 2000s, groups such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[LFO (group)|LFO]] have disliked the term \"boy band\" and have preferred to be known as a \"male vocal group\".<ref>{{cite web| title = I would be the dessert because I\u2019m satisfying | url = http://www.popjustice.com/interviewsandfeatures/backstreet-boys-interview/49849/|publisher= Pop Justice | accessdate = August 16, 2012|date=October 24, 2007|quote=We were never a boyband.

The B-tree is a generalization of a [[binary search tree]] in that a node can have more than two children.<ref name=\"Comer\">{{cite journal|last1=Comer|first1=Douglas|title=The Ubiquitous B-Tree|journal=Computing Surveys|date=June 1979|volume=11|issue=2|page=123\u2013137|doi=10.1145/356770.356776}}</ref> Unlike [[self-balancing binary search tree]]s, the B-tree is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as discs. It is commonly used in [[database]]s and [[file system]]s.\n\nWhat, if anything, the ''B'' stands for has never been established.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:B-tree.svg|thumb|400px|right|A B-tree {{Harv|Bayer|McCreight|1972}} of order 5 {{Harv|Knuth|1998}}.]]\nIn B-trees, internal ([[Leaf node|non-leaf]]) nodes can have a variable number of child nodes within some pre-defined range. When data is inserted or removed from a node, its number of child nodes changes. In order to maintain the pre-defined range, internal nodes may be joined or split. Because a range of child nodes is permitted, B-trees do not need re-balancing as frequently as other self-balancing search trees, but may waste some space, since nodes are not entirely full. The lower and upper bounds on the number of child nodes are typically fixed for a particular implementation. For example, in a [[2-3 tree|2-3 B-tree]] (often simply referred to as a '''2-3 tree'''), each internal node may have only 2 or 3 child nodes.\n\nEach internal node of a B-tree contains a number of [[Unique key|keys]]. The keys act as separation values which divide its [[subtree]]s. For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub>. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than ''a''<sub>1</sub>, all values in the middle subtree will be between ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub>, and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than ''a''<sub>2</sub>.\n\nUsually, the number of keys is chosen to vary between <math>d</math> and <math>2d</math>, where <math>d</math> is the minimum number of keys, and <math>d+1</math> is the minimum [[Outdegree#Indegree and outdegree|degree]] or [[branching factor]] of the tree. In practice, the keys take up the most space in a node. The factor of 2 will guarantee that nodes can be split or combined. If an internal node has <math>2d</math> keys, then adding a key to that node can be accomplished by splitting the hypothetical <math>2d+1</math> key node into two <math>d</math> key nodes and moving the key that would have been in the middle to the parent node. Each split node has the required minimum number of keys. Similarly, if an internal node and its neighbor each have <math>d</math> keys, then a key may be deleted from the internal node by combining it with its neighbor. Deleting the key would make the internal node have <math>d-1</math> keys; joining the neighbor would add <math>d</math> keys plus one more key brought down from the neighbor's parent. The result is an entirely full node of <math>2d</math> keys.\n\nThe number of branches (or child nodes) from a node will be one more than the number of keys stored in the node. In a 2-3 B-tree, the internal nodes will store either one key (with two child nodes) or two keys (with three child nodes). A B-tree is sometimes described with the parameters <math>(d+1)</math> \u2014 <math>(2d+1)</math> or simply with the highest branching order, <math>(2d+1)</math>.\n\nA B-tree is kept balanced by requiring that all leaf nodes be at the same depth. This depth will increase slowly as elements are added to the tree, but an increase in the overall depth is infrequent, and results in all leaf nodes being one more node farther away from the root.\n\nB-trees have substantial advantages over alternative implementations when the time to access the data of a node greatly exceeds the time spent processing that data, because then the cost of accessing the node may be amortized over multiple operations within the node. This usually occurs when the node data are in [[secondary storage]] such as [[hard drive|disk drives]]. By maximizing the number of keys within each [[internal node]], the height of the tree decreases and the number of expensive node accesses is reduced. In addition, rebalancing of the tree occurs less often. The maximum number of child nodes depends on the information that must be stored for each child node and the size of a full [[Block (data storage)|disk block]] or an analogous size in secondary storage. While 2-3 B-trees are easier to explain, practical B-trees using secondary storage need a large number of child nodes to improve performance.\n\n===Variants===\nThe term '''B-tree''' may refer to a specific design or it may refer to a general class of designs. In the narrow sense, a B-tree stores keys in its internal nodes but need not store those keys in the records at the leaves. The general class includes variations such as the [[B+ tree]] and the B<sup>*</sup> tree.\n* In the [[B+ tree]], copies of the keys are stored in the internal nodes; the keys and records are stored in leaves; in addition, a leaf node may include a pointer to the next leaf node to speed sequential access.<ref name=\"Comer\" />\n* The B<sup>*</sup> tree balances more neighboring internal nodes to keep the internal nodes more densely packed.{{r|Comer}} This variant ensures non-root nodes are at least 2/3 full instead of 1/2 {{Harv|Knuth|1998|p=488}}. As the most costly part of operation of inserting the node in B-tree is splitting the node, B<sup>*</sup>-trees are created to postpone splitting operation as long as they can.<ref name=\"Milo\">{{cite book |last=Toma\u0161evi\u0107 |first=Milo |title=Algorithms and Data Structures |year=2008 |publisher=Akademska misao |location=Belgrade, Serbia |isbn=978-86-7466-328-8 |pages=274-275}}</ref> To maintain this, instead of immediately splitting up a node when it gets full, its keys are shared with a node next to it. This spill operation is less costly to do than split, because it requires only shifting the keys between existing nodes, not allocating memory for a new one.{{r|Milo}} For inserting, first it is checked whether the node has some free space in it, and if so, the new key is just inserted in the node. However, if the node is full (it has {{math|''m'' \u2212 1 }} keys, where {{mvar| m}} is the order of the tree as maximum number of pointers to subtrees from one node), it needs to be checked whether the right sibling exists and has some free space. If the right sibling has {{math|''j'' < ''m'' \u2212 1 }} keys, then keys are redistributed between the two sibling nodes as evenly as possible. For this purpose, {{mvar|m}} keys from the current node plus the new key inserted, one key from the parent node and {{mvar|j}} keys from the sibling node are seen as an ordered array of {{math|''m'' + ''j'' + 1}} keys. The array becomes split by half, so that {{math|{{floor|(''m'' + ''j'' + 1)/2}}}} lowest keys stay in the current node, the next (middle) key is inserted in the parent and the rest go to the right sibling.{{r|Milo}} (The newly inserted key might end up in any of the three places.) The situation when right sibling is full, and left isn't is analogous.{{r|Milo}} When both the sibling nodes are full, then the two nodes (current node and a sibling) are split into three and one more key is shifted up the tree, to the parent node.{{r|Milo}} If the parent is full, then spill/split operation propagates towards the root node.{{r|Milo}} Deleting nodes is somewhat more complex than inserting however.\n* B-trees can be turned into [[order statistic tree]]s to allow rapid searches for the Nth record in key order, or counting the number of records between any two records, and various other related operations.<ref>[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/algorithms/cbtree.html Counted B-Trees], retrieved 2010-01-25</ref>\n\n==B-tree usage in databases==\n===Time to search a sorted file===\nUsually, sorting and searching algorithms have been characterized by the number of comparison operations that must be performed using [[Big O notation|order notation]]. A [[binary search]] of a sorted table with {{mvar|N}} records, for example, can be done in roughly {{math|\u2308 log<sub>2</sub> ''N'' \u2309}} comparisons. If the table had 1,000,000 records, then a specific record could be located with at most 20 comparisons: {{math|1=\u2308 log<sub>2</sub> (1,000,000) \u2309 = 20}}.\n\nLarge databases have historically been kept on disk drives. The time to read a record on a disk drive far exceeds the time needed to compare keys once the record is available. The time to read a record from a disk drive involves a [[seek time]] and a rotational delay. The seek time may be 0 to 20 or more milliseconds, and the rotational delay averages about half the rotation period. For a 7200 RPM drive, the rotation period is 8.33 milliseconds. For a drive such as the Seagate ST3500320NS, the track-to-track seek time is 0.8 milliseconds and the average reading seek time is 8.5 milliseconds.<ref>Seagate Technology LLC, Product Manual: Barracuda ES.2 Serial ATA, Rev. F., publication 100468393, 2008 [http://www.seagate.com/staticfiles/support/disc/manuals/NL35%20Series%20&%20BC%20ES%20Series/Barracuda%20ES.2%20Series/100468393f.pdf], page 6</ref> For simplicity, assume reading from disk takes about 10 milliseconds.\n\nNaively, then, the time to locate one record out of a million would take 20 disk reads times 10 milliseconds per disk read, which is 0.2 seconds.\n\nThe time won't be that bad because individual records are grouped together in a disk '''block'''. A disk block might be 16 kilobytes. If each record is 160 bytes, then 100 records could be stored in each block. The disk read time above was actually for an entire block. Once the disk head is in position, one or more disk blocks can be read with little delay. With 100 records per block, the last 6 or so comparisons don't need to do any disk reads\u2014the comparisons are all within the last disk block read.\n\nTo speed the search further, the first 13 to 14 comparisons (which each required a disk access) must be sped up.\n\n===An index speeds the search===\nA significant improvement can be made with an [[Index (database)|index]]. In the example above, initial disk reads narrowed the search range by a factor of two. That can be improved substantially by creating an auxiliary index that contains the first record in each disk block (sometimes called a [[Index (database)#Sparse index|sparse index]]). This auxiliary index would be 1% of the size of the original database, but it can be searched more quickly. Finding an entry in the auxiliary index would tell us which block to search in the main database; after searching the auxiliary index, we would have to search only that one block of the main database\u2014at a cost of one more disk read. The index would hold 10,000 entries, so it would take at most 14 comparisons. Like the main database, the last 6 or so comparisons in the aux index would be on the same disk block. The index could be searched in about 8 disk reads, and the desired record could be accessed in 9 disk reads.\n\nThe trick of creating an auxiliary index can be repeated to make an auxiliary index to the auxiliary index. That would make an aux-aux index that would need only 100 entries and would fit in one disk block.\n\nInstead of reading 14 disk blocks to find the desired record, we only need to read 3 blocks. Reading and searching the first (and only) block of the aux-aux index identifies the relevant block in aux-index. Reading and searching that aux-index block identifies the relevant block in the main database. Instead of 150 milliseconds, we need only 30 milliseconds to get the record.\n\nThe auxiliary indices have turned the search problem from a binary search requiring roughly {{math|log<sub>2</sub> ''N''}} disk reads to one requiring only {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub> ''N''}} disk reads where {{mvar|b}} is the blocking factor (the number of entries per block: {{math|1=''b'' = 100}} entries per block in our example; {{math|1=log<sub>100</sub> 1,000,000 = 3}} reads).\n\nIn practice, if the main database is being frequently searched, the aux-aux index and much of the aux index may reside in a [[page cache|disk cache]], so they would not incur a disk read.\n\n===Insertions and deletions===\nIf the database does not change, then compiling the index is simple to do, and the index need never be changed. If there are changes, then managing the database and its index becomes more complicated.\n\nDeleting records from a database is relatively easy. The index can stay the same, and the record can just be marked as deleted. The database remains in sorted order. If there are a large number of deletions, then searching and storage become less efficient.\n\nInsertions can be very slow in a sorted sequential file because room for the inserted record must be made. Inserting a record before the first record requires shifting all of the records down one. Such an operation is just too expensive to be practical. One solution is to leave some spaces. Instead of densely packing all the records in a block, the block can have some free space to allow for subsequent insertions. Those spaces would be marked as if they were \"deleted\" records.\n\nBoth insertions and deletions are fast as long as space is available on a block. If an insertion won't fit on the block, then some free space on some nearby block must be found and the auxiliary indices adjusted. The hope is that enough space is available nearby, such that a lot of blocks do not need to be reorganized. Alternatively, some out-of-sequence disk blocks may be used.\n\n===Advantages of B-tree usage for databases===\nThe B-tree uses all of the ideas described above. In particular, a B-tree:\n* keeps keys in sorted order for sequential traversing\n* uses a hierarchical index to minimize the number of disk reads\n* uses partially full blocks to speed insertions and deletions\n* keeps the index balanced with a recursive algorithm\n\nIn addition, a B-tree minimizes waste by making sure the interior nodes are at least half full. A B-tree can handle an arbitrary number of insertions and deletions.\n\n==Technical description==\n===Terminology===\nThe literature on B-trees is not uniform in its terminology {{Harv|Folk|Zoellick|1992|p=362}}.\n\n{{Harvtxt|Bayer|McCreight|1972}}, {{Harvtxt|Comer|1979}}, and others define the '''order''' of B-tree as the minimum number of keys in a non-root node. {{Harvtxt|Folk|Zoellick|1992}} points out that terminology is ambiguous because the maximum number of keys is not clear. An order 3 B-tree might hold a maximum of 6 keys or a maximum of 7 keys. {{Harvtxt|Knuth|1998|p=483}} avoids the problem by defining the '''order''' to be maximum number of children (which is one more than the maximum number of keys).\n\nThe term '''leaf''' is also inconsistent. {{Harvtxt|Bayer|McCreight|1972}} considered the leaf level to be the lowest level of keys, but Knuth considered the leaf level to be one level below the lowest keys {{Harv|Folk|Zoellick|1992|p=363}}. There are many possible implementation choices. In some designs, the leaves may hold the entire data record; in other designs, the leaves may only hold pointers to the data record. Those choices are not fundamental to the idea of a B-tree.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bayer|McCreight|1972}} avoided the issue by saying an index element is a (physically adjacent) pair of (''x'',&nbsp;''a'') where ''x'' is the key, and ''a'' is some associated information. The associated information might be a pointer to a record or records in a random access, but what it was didn't really matter. {{Harvtxt|Bayer|McCreight|1972}} states, \"For this paper the associated information is of no further interest.\"</ref>\n\nThere are also unfortunate choices like using the variable ''k'' to represent the number of children when ''k'' could be confused with the number of keys.\n\nFor simplicity, most authors assume there are a fixed number of keys that fit in a node. The basic assumption is the key size is fixed and the node size is fixed. In practice, variable length keys may be employed {{Harv|Folk|Zoellick|1992|p=379}}.\n\n===Definition===\nAccording to Knuth's definition, a B-tree of order ''m'' is a tree which satisfies the following properties:\n\n# Every node has at most ''m'' children.\n# Every non-leaf node (except root) has at least &lceil;''m''/2&rceil; child nodes.\n# The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node.\n# A non-leaf node with ''k'' children contains ''k'' &minus; 1 keys.\n# All leaves appear in the same level.\n\nEach internal node\u2019s keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub>. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than ''a''<sub>1</sub>, all values in the middle subtree will be between ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub>, and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than ''a''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n;'''Internal nodes'''\n: Internal nodes are all nodes except for leaf nodes and the root node. They are usually represented as an ordered set of elements and child pointers. Every internal node contains a '''maximum''' of ''U'' children and a '''minimum''' of ''L'' children. Thus, the number of elements is always 1 less than the number of child pointers (the number of elements is between ''L''\u22121 and ''U''\u22121). ''U'' must be either 2''L'' or 2''L''\u22121; therefore each internal node is at least half full. The relationship between ''U'' and ''L'' implies that two half-full nodes can be joined to make a legal node, and one full node can be split into two legal nodes (if there\u2019s room to push one element up into the parent). These properties make it possible to delete and insert new values into a B-tree and adjust the tree to preserve the B-tree properties.\n\n;'''The root node'''\n: The root node\u2019s number of children has the same upper limit as internal nodes, but has no lower limit. For example, when there are fewer than ''L''\u22121 elements in the entire tree, the root will be the only node in the tree with no children at all.\n\n;'''Leaf nodes'''\n: Leaf nodes have the same restriction on the number of elements, but have no children, and no child pointers.\n\nA B-tree of depth ''n''+1 can hold about ''U'' times as many items as a B-tree of depth ''n'', but the cost of search, insert, and delete operations grows with the depth of the tree. As with any balanced tree, the cost grows much more slowly than the number of elements.\n\nSome balanced trees store values only at leaf nodes, and use different kinds of nodes for leaf nodes and internal nodes. B-trees keep values in every node in the tree, and may use the same structure for all nodes. However, since leaf nodes never have children, the B-trees benefit from improved performance if they use a specialized structure.\n\n==Best case and worst case heights==\nLet ''h'' be the height of the classic B-tree. Let ''n'' > 0 be the number of entries in the tree.<ref>If ''n'' is zero, then no root node is needed, so the height of an empty tree is not well defined.</ref> Let ''m'' be the maximum number of children a node can have. Each node can have at most ''m''\u22121 keys.\n\nIt can be shown (by induction for example) that a B-tree of height ''h'' with all its nodes completely filled has {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''m''<sup>''h''</sup>&minus;1}} entries. Hence, the best case height of a B-tree is:\n: <math>\\lceil \\log_{m} (n+1) \\rceil -1</math>\n\nLet <math>d</math> be the minimum number of children an internal (non-root) node can have. For an ordinary B-tree, <math> d = \\left\\lceil m/2 \\right\\rceil. </math>\n\n{{Harvtxt|Comer|1979|p=127}} and {{Harvtxt|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|Stein|2001|pp=383\u2013384}} give the worst case height of a B-tree (where the root node is considered to have height 0) as\n: <math>h \\le \\left\\lfloor \\log_{d}\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right) \\right\\rfloor .</math>\n\n==Algorithms==\n{{confusing|reason=the discussion below uses \"element\", \"value\", \"key\", \"separator\", and \"separation value\" to mean essentially the same thing. The terms are not clearly defined. There are some subtle issues at the root and leaves\n|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Search===\nSearching is similar to searching a binary search tree. Starting at the root, the tree is recursively traversed from top to bottom. At each level, the search reduces its field of view to the child pointer (subtree) whose range includes the search value. A subtree's range is defined by the values, or keys, contained in its parent node. These limiting values are also known as separation values.\n\nBinary search is typically (but not necessarily) used within nodes to find the separation values and child tree of interest.\n\n===Insertion===\n[[Image:B tree insertion example.png|thumb|A B Tree insertion example with each iteration. The nodes of this B tree have at most 3 children (Knuth order 3).]]\n\nAll insertions start at a leaf node. To insert a new element, search the tree to find the leaf node where the new element should be added. Insert the new element into that node with the following steps:\n\n# If the node contains fewer than the maximum allowed number of elements, then there is room for the new element. Insert the new element in the node, keeping the node's elements ordered.\n# Otherwise the node is full, evenly split it into two nodes so:\n## A single median is chosen from among the leaf's elements and the new element.\n## Values less than the median are put in the new left node and values greater than the median are put in the new right node, with the median acting as a separation value.\n## The separation value is inserted in the node's parent, which may cause it to be split, and so on. If the node has no parent (i.e., the node was the root), create a new root above this node (increasing the height of the tree).\n\nIf the splitting goes all the way up to the root, it creates a new root with a single separator value and two children, which is why the lower bound on the size of internal nodes does not apply to the root. The maximum number of elements per node is ''U''\u22121. When a node is split, one element moves to the parent, but one element is added. So, it must be possible to divide the maximum number ''U''\u22121 of elements into two legal nodes. If this number is odd, then ''U''=2''L'' and one of the new nodes contains (''U''\u22122)/2 = ''L''\u22121 elements, and hence is a legal node, and the other contains one more element, and hence it is legal too. If ''U''\u22121 is even, then ''U''=2''L''\u22121, so there are 2''L''\u22122 elements in the node. Half of this number is ''L''\u22121, which is the minimum number of elements allowed per node.\n\nAn improved algorithm {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} supports a single pass down the tree from the root to the node where the insertion will take place, splitting any full nodes encountered on the way. This prevents the need to recall the parent nodes into memory, which may be expensive if the nodes are on secondary storage. However, to use this improved algorithm, we must be able to send one element to the parent and split the remaining ''U''\u22122 elements into two legal nodes, without adding a new element. This requires ''U'' = 2''L'' rather than ''U'' = 2''L''\u22121, which accounts for why some textbooks impose this requirement in defining B-trees.\n\n===Deletion===\nThere are two popular strategies for deletion from a B-tree.\n\n# Locate and delete the item, then restructure the tree to retain its invariants, '''OR'''\n# Do a single pass down the tree, but before entering (visiting) a node, restructure the tree so that once the key to be deleted is encountered, it can be deleted without triggering the need for any further restructuring\n\nThe algorithm below uses the former strategy.\n\nThere are two special cases to consider when deleting an element:\n\n# The element in an internal node is a separator for its child nodes\n# Deleting an element may put its node under the minimum number of elements and children\n\nThe procedures for these cases are in order below.\n\n====Deletion from a leaf node====\n# Search for the value to delete.\n# If the value is in a leaf node, simply delete it from the node.\n# If underflow happens, rebalance the tree as described in section \"Rebalancing after deletion\" below.\n\n====Deletion from an internal node====\nEach element in an internal node acts as a separation value for two subtrees, therefore we need to find a replacement for separation. Note that the largest element in the left subtree is still less than the separator. Likewise, the smallest element in the right subtree is still greater than the separator. Both of those elements are in leaf nodes, and either one can be the new separator for the two subtrees. Algorithmically described below:\n\n# Choose a new separator (either the largest element in the left subtree or the smallest element in the right subtree), remove it from the leaf node it is in, and replace the element to be deleted with the new separator.\n# The previous step deleted an element (the new separator) from a leaf node. If that leaf node is now deficient (has fewer than the required number of nodes), then rebalance the tree starting from the leaf node.\n\n====Rebalancing after deletion====\nRebalancing starts from a leaf and proceeds toward the root until the tree is balanced. If deleting an element from a node has brought it under the minimum size, then some elements must be redistributed to bring all nodes up to the minimum. Usually, the redistribution involves moving an element from a sibling node that has more than the minimum number of nodes. That redistribution operation is called a '''rotation'''. If no sibling can spare an element, then the deficient node must be '''merged''' with a sibling. The merge causes the parent to lose a separator element, so the parent may become deficient and need rebalancing. The merging and rebalancing may continue all the way to the root. Since the minimum element count doesn't apply to the root, making the root be the only deficient node is not a problem. The algorithm to rebalance the tree is as follows:{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n* If the deficient node's right sibling exists and has more than the minimum number of elements, then rotate left\n*# Copy the separator from the parent to the end of the deficient node (the separator moves down; the deficient node now has the minimum number of elements)\n*# Replace the separator in the parent with the first element of the right sibling (right sibling loses one node but still has at least the minimum number of elements)\n*# The tree is now balanced\n* Otherwise, if the deficient node's left sibling exists and has more than the minimum number of elements, then rotate right\n*# Copy the separator from the parent to the start of the deficient node (the separator moves down; deficient node now has the minimum number of elements)\n*# Replace the separator in the parent with the last element of the left sibling (left sibling loses one node but still has at least the minimum number of elements)\n*# The tree is now balanced\n* Otherwise, if both immediate siblings have only the minimum number of elements, then merge with a sibling sandwiching their separator taken off from their parent\n*# Copy the separator to the end of the left node (the left node may be the deficient node or it may be the sibling with the minimum number of elements)\n*# Move all elements from the right node to the left node (the left node now has the maximum number of elements, and the right node \u2013 empty)\n*# Remove the separator from the parent along with its empty right child (the parent loses an element)\n*#* If the parent is the root and now has no elements, then free it and make the merged node the new root (tree becomes shallower)\n*#* Otherwise, if the parent has fewer than the required number of elements, then rebalance the parent\n\n:<small>'''Note''': The rebalancing operations are different for B+ trees (e.g., rotation is different because parent has copy of the key) and B<sup>*</sup>-tree (e.g., three siblings are merged into two siblings).</small>\n\n===Sequential access===\nWhile freshly loaded databases tend to have good sequential behavior, this behavior becomes increasingly difficult to maintain as a database grows, resulting in more random I/O and performance challenges.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~bender/pub/cache-oblivious-btree.ps |title=Cache Oblivious B-trees |publisher=State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook |accessdate=2011-01-17}}</ref>\n\n===Initial construction===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nA common special case is adding a large amount of ''pre-sorted'' data into an initially empty B-tree. While it is quite possible to simply perform a series of successive inserts, inserting sorted data results in a tree composed almost entirely of half-full nodes. Instead, a special \"bulk loading\" algorithm can be used to produce a more efficient tree with a higher branching factor.\n\nWhen the input is sorted, all insertions are at the rightmost edge of the tree, and in particular any time a node is split, we are guaranteed that the no more insertions will take place in the left half. When bulk loading, we take advantage of this, and instead of splitting overfull nodes evenly, split them as ''unevenly'' as possible: leave the left node completely full and create a right node with zero keys and one child (in violation of the usual B-tree rules).\n\nAt the end of bulk loading, the tree is composed almost entirely of completely full nodes; only the rightmost node on each level may be less than full. Because those nodes may also be less than ''half'' full, to re-establish the normal B-tree rules, combine such nodes with their (guaranteed full) left siblings and divide the keys to produce two nodes at least half full. The only node which lacks a full left sibling is the root, which is permitted to be less than half full.\n\n==In filesystems==\nIn addition to its use in databases, the B-tree (or {{section link||Variants}}) is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block <math>i</math> address into a disk block (or perhaps to a [[cylinder-head-sector]]) address.\n\nSome operating systems require the user to allocate the maximum size of the file when the file is created. The file can then be allocated as contiguous disk blocks. In that case, to convert the file block address <math>i</math> into a disk block address, the operating system simply adds the file block address <math>i</math> to the address of the first disk block constituting the file. The scheme is simple, but the file cannot exceed its created size.\n\nOther operating systems allow a file to grow. The resulting disk blocks may not be contiguous, so mapping logical blocks to physical blocks is more involved.\n\n[[MS-DOS]], for example, used a simple [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT). The FAT has an entry for each disk block,<ref group=\"note\">For FAT, what is called a \"disk block\" here is what the FAT documentation calls a \"cluster\", which is fixed-size group of one or more contiguous whole physical disk [[Cylinder-head-sector|sectors]]. For the purposes of this discussion, a cluster has no significant difference from a physical sector.</ref> and that entry identifies whether its block is used by a file and if so, which block (if any) is the next disk block of the same file. So, the allocation of each file is represented as a [[linked list]] in the table. In order to find the disk address of file block <math>i</math>, the operating system (or disk utility) must sequentially follow the file's linked list in the FAT. Worse, to find a free disk block, it must sequentially scan the FAT. For MS-DOS, that was not a huge penalty because the disks and files were small and the FAT had few entries and relatively short file chains. In the [[FAT12]] filesystem (used on floppy disks and early hard disks), there were no more than 4,080 <ref group=\"note\">Two of these were reserved for special purposes, so only 4078 could actually represent disk blocks (clusters).</ref> entries, and the FAT would usually be resident in memory. As disks got bigger, the FAT architecture began to confront penalties. On a large disk using FAT, it may be necessary to perform disk reads to learn the disk location of a file block to be read or written.\n\n[[TOPS-20]] (and possibly [[TOPS-20#TENEX|TENEX]]) used a 0 to 2 level tree that has similarities to a B-tree{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. A disk block was 512 36-bit words. If the file fit in a 512 (2<sup>9</sup>) word block, then the file directory would point to that physical disk block. If the file fit in 2<sup>18</sup> words, then the directory would point to an aux index; the 512 words of that index would either be NULL (the block isn't allocated) or point to the physical address of the block. If the file fit in 2<sup>27</sup> words, then the directory would point to a block holding an aux-aux index; each entry would either be NULL or point to an aux index. Consequently, the physical disk block for a 2<sup>27</sup> word file could be located in two disk reads and read on the third.\n\nApple's filesystem [[HFS+]], Microsoft's [[NTFS]],<ref name=insidewin2kntfs>{{cite web\n | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995846.aspx\n | title = Inside Win2K NTFS, Part 1\n | author = [[Mark Russinovich]]\n | publisher = [[MSDN|Microsoft Developer Network]]\n | accessdate = 2008-04-18\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080413181940/http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995846.aspx| archivedate= 13 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> AIX (jfs2) and some [[Linux]] filesystems, such as [[btrfs]] and [[Ext4]], use B-trees.\n\nB<sup>*</sup>-trees are used in the [[Hierarchical File System|HFS]] and [[Reiser4]] [[file system]]s.\n\n[[DragonFly BSD]]'s [[HAMMER]] file system uses a modified B+-tree.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dragonflybsd.org/hammer/hammer.pdf|date=2008-06-21|author=Matthew Dillon|title=The HAMMER Filesystem}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n===Access concurrency===\nLehman and Yao<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=319663&dl=GUIDE&coll=GUIDE&CFID=61777986&CFTOKEN=74351190 |title=Efficient locking for concurrent operations on B-trees |doi=10.1145/319628.319663 |publisher=Portal.acm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}</ref> showed that all the read locks could be avoided (and thus concurrent access greatly improved) by linking the tree blocks at each level together with a \"next\" pointer. This results in a tree structure where both insertion and search operations descend from the root to the leaf. Write locks are only required as a tree block is modified.

During the few years after its foundation the British Museum received several further gifts, including the [[Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts]] and [[David Garrick]]'s library of 1,000 printed plays. The predominance of natural history, books and manuscripts began to lessen when in 1772 the museum acquired for \u00a38,410 its first significant antiquities in [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]'s \"first\" collection of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]].<ref name=\"Hoock2010\">{{cite book|last1=Hoock|first1=Holger|title=Empires of the Imagination: Politics, War and the Arts in the British World, 1750\u20131850|date=2010|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781861978592|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tuW554NdWk8C&pg=PA207&dq=%22william+hamilton%22%22british+museum%22+greek+vases#v=onepage&q=%22william%20hamilton%22%22british%20museum%22%20greek%20vases&f=false|accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Indolence and energy (1778\u20131800)===\n[[File:Entrance ticket to the British Museum, London March 3, 1790.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance ticket to the British Museum, London 3 March 1790]]\nFrom 1778, a display of objects from the [[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]s brought back from the round-the-world voyages of Captain [[James Cook]] and the travels of other explorers fascinated visitors with a glimpse of previously unknown lands. The bequest of a collection of books, [[engraved gem]]s, coins, prints and drawings by [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]] in 1800 did much to raise the museum's reputation; but Montagu House became increasingly crowded and decrepit and it was apparent that it would be unable to cope with further expansion.<ref>BMCE1/5, 1175 (13 May 1820).

A list of donations to the museum, dated 31 January 1784, refers to the Hamilton bequest of a \"Colossal Foot of an [[Apollo]] in Marble\". It was one of two antiquities of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the [[Royal Society]] in London.\n\n===Growth and change (1800\u201325)===\n[[File:British Museum, The Elgin Room, 1937.jpg|thumb|The [[Elgin Marbles|Elgin]] Room, 1937]]\n[[File:P8282318.1.JPG|thumb|right|Left to Right: [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], Townley Gallery and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s west wing under construction, July 1828]]\n[[File:Mauso03.JPG|thumb|The [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus|Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] Room, 1920s]]\n\nIn the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French campaign]] in the [[Battle of the Nile]], in 1801, the British Museum acquired more Egyptian sculptures and in 1802 [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] presented the [[Rosetta Stone]] \u2013 key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs.<ref>''Wondrous Curiosities \u2013 Ancient Egypt at the British Museum'', pp. 66\u201372 (Stephanie Moser, 2006, {{ISBN|0-226-54209-2}})</ref> Gifts and purchases from [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], British consul general in Egypt, beginning with the [[Younger Memnon|Colossal bust of Ramesses II]] in 1818, laid the foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture.<ref>''The Story of the British Museum'', p. 24 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7141-2772-8}})</ref> Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built exhibition space, the [[Charles Towneley|Charles Towneley collection]], much of it Roman Sculpture, in 1805.

However, following the founding of the [[National Gallery, London]] in 1824,<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Understanding of the foundation of the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] is complicated by the fact that there is no documented history of the institution. At first the National Gallery functioned effectively as part of the British Museum, to which the [[trustee]]s transferred most of their most important pictures (ex. portraits). Full control was handed over to the National Gallery in 1868, after the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1840\u20131859|Act of Parliament of 1856]] established the Gallery as an independent body.</ref> the proposed Picture Gallery was no longer needed, and the space on the upper floor was given over to the [[Natural history]] collections.<ref>The Story of the British Museum, p. 25 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7141-2772-8}})</ref>\n\n===The largest building site in Europe (1825\u201350)===\n[[File:Image-The Grenville Library (1875).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Thomas Grenville|Grenville]] Library, 1875]]\nThe museum became a construction site as [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s grand [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] building gradually arose. The [[King's Library]], on the ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in London. Although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, special openings were arranged during [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851. In spite of dirt and disruption the collections grew, outpacing the new building.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn 1840, the museum became involved in its first overseas [[excavation (archeology)|excavation]]s, [[Charles Fellows]]'s expedition to [[Xanthos]], in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient [[Lycia]], among them the [[Nereid Monument|Nereid]] and [[Tomb of Payava|Payava]] monuments. In 1857, [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]] was to discover the 4th-century BC [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum of Halikarnassos]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. In the 1840s and 1850s the museum supported excavations in [[Assyria]] by [[Austen Henry Layard|A.H. Layard]] and others at sites such as [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]]. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of [[Ashurbanipal]]'s great library of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]], which helped to make the museum a focus for [[Assyriology|Assyrian studies]].<ref>Reade, Julian (2004). Assyrian Sculpture. London: The British Museum Press, p. 16</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Grenville|Sir Thomas Grenville]] (1755\u20131846), a trustee of the British Museum from 1830, assembled a library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the British Library moved to [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] in 1998.\n\n===Collecting from the wider world (1850\u201375)===\nThe opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]]'s 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries were constructed for [[Assyria]]n sculptures and [[Sydney Smirke]]'s [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in [[South Kensington]], which would later become the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum of Natural History]].\n\nRoughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the \"second founder\" of the British Museum, the Italian librarian [[Anthony Panizzi]]. Under his supervision, the British Museum Library (now part of the [[British Library]]) quintupled in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called a national library, the largest library in the world after the [[National Library of Paris]].<ref name=\"world and its people\"/> The [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the centre of Smirke's design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's brother, Sydney Smirke.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dickens Charles Jr. |author-link=Charles Dickens Jr. |year=1879|title=Museum, British|work=[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-mus.htm|accessdate=22 August 2007|quote=Beyond the new Lycian room is the READING ROOM: [...] ; circular structure; original suggestion of Thomas Watts, improved by A.

A real coup for the museum was the purchase in 1867, over French objections, of the [[Louis, Duke of Blacas|Duke of Blacas]]'s wide-ranging and valuable collection of antiquities. Overseas excavations continued and [[John Turtle Wood]] discovered the remains of the 4th century BC [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]], another [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Wonder of the Ancient World]].<ref>South from Ephesus \u2013 An Escape From The Tyranny of Western Art, pp. 33\u201334,(Brian Sewell, 2002, {{ISBN|1-903933-16-1}})</ref>\n\n===Scholarship and legacies (1875\u20131900)===\nThe natural history collections were an integral part of the British Museum until their removal to the new British Museum of Natural History in 1887, nowadays the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. With the departure and the completion of the new White Wing (fronting Montague Street) in 1884, more space was available for antiquities and [[ethnography]] and the library could further expand. This was a time of innovation as electric lighting was introduced in the Reading Room and exhibition galleries.<ref>{{cite news| title=The Electric Light in the British Museum| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=18 December 1879| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1879/12/18/80703696.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[William Burges]] collection of [[armoury]] was bequeathed to the museum in 1881. In 1882, the museum was involved in the establishment of the independent [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, [[Augustus Wollaston Franks|A. W. Franks]], was followed by an immense bequest of 3,300 [[Ring (finger)|finger rings]], 153 drinking vessels, 512 pieces of continental porcelain, 1,500 [[netsuke]], 850 [[inro]], over 30,000 [[bookplates]] and miscellaneous items of jewellery and plate, among them the [[Oxus Treasure]].<ref>Caygill, Marjorie (2006).

In 1895 the trustees purchased the 69 houses surrounding the museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the west, north and east sides of the museum. The first stage was the construction of the northern wing beginning 1906.\n\nAll the while, the collections kept growing. [[Emil Torday]] collected in Central Africa, [[Marc Aurel Stein|Aurel Stein]] in Central Asia, [[David George Hogarth|D.G. Hogarth]], [[Leonard Woolley]] and [[T. E. Lawrence]] excavated at [[Carchemish]]. Around this time, the American collector and philanthropist [[J Pierpont Morgan]] donated a substantial number of objects to the museum,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=101677&peoA=101677-3-9| title=British Museum \u2013 Collection search: You searched for| work=British Museum}}</ref> including [[William Greenwell]]'s collection of prehistoric artefacts from across Europe which he had purchased for \u00a310,000 in 1908. Morgan had also acquired a major part of Sir [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]]'s coin collection, which was later sold to the museum by his son [[J. P. Morgan Jr.|John Pierpont Morgan Junior]] in 1915. In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated to a Postal Tube Railway at Holborn, the [[National Library of Wales|National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth)]] and a country house near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]]. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931. It is today the oldest in continuous existence.<ref>Permanent establishment of the Research Laboratory (now the oldest such establishment in continuous existence) {{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_scientific/history.aspx| title=History| work=British Museum}}</ref> In 1923, the British Museum welcomed over one million visitors.\n\n===Disruption and reconstruction (1925\u201350)===\nNew [[mezzanine]] floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an attempt to cope with the flood of books. In 1931, the art dealer [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Sir Joseph Duveen]] offered funds to build a gallery for the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon sculptures]]. Designed by the American architect [[John Russell Pope]], it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole, the Keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities appreciated the original top-lighting of these galleries and removed the Victorian colour scheme, commenting: <blockquote>The old Elgin Gallery was painted a deep terracotta red, which, though in some ways satisfactory, diminished its apparent size, and was apt to produce a depressing effect on the visitor. It was decided to experiment with lighter colours, and the walls of the large room were painted with what was, at its first application, a pure cold white, but which after a year's exposure had unfortunately yellowed. The small Elgin Room was painted with pure white tinted with prussian blue, and the Room of the metopes was painted with pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black; it was necessary, for practical reasons, to colour all the dadoes a darker colour<ref>Quoted Ashmole (1994), 125</ref></blockquote>}} However, in August 1939, due to the imminence of war and the likelihood of air-raids, the Parthenon Sculptures, along with the museum's most valued collections, were dispersed to secure basements, [[English country house|country houses]], [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych Underground station]], the [[National Library of Wales]] and a quarry. The evacuation was timely, for in 1940 the Duveen Gallery was severely damaged by bombing.<ref>Cook, B.F. (2005). The Elgin Marbles.

Gold, silver and [[garnet]] grave goods from the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ship burial at [[Sutton Hoo]] (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from [[Mildenhall Treasure|Mildenhall]], Suffolk (1946). The immediate [[post-war]] years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.\n\n===A new public face (1950\u201375)===\n[[File:The Duveen Gallery (1980s).jpg|thumb|The re-opened [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Duveen]] Gallery, 1980]]\n\nIn 1953, the museum celebrated its [[200 (number)|bicentenary]]. Many changes followed: the first full-time in house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, A [[The British Museum Friends|Friends]] organisation was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the [[board of trustees]] changed and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] became fully independent. By 1959 the [[British Museum Department of Coins and Medals|Coins and Medals]] office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] Classical and Near Eastern galleries.<ref>Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 270</ref> In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole had never liked the Duveen Gallery: <blockquote>It is, I suppose, not positively bad, but it could have been infinitely better. It is pretentious, in that it uses the ancient Marbles to decorate itself. This is a long outmoded idea, and the exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do. And, although it incorporates them, it is out of scale, and tends to dwarf them with its bogus Doric features, including those columns, supporting almost nothing which would have made an ancient Greek artist architect wince. The source of daylight is too high above the sculptures, a fault that is only concealed by the amount of reflection from the pinkish marble walls. These are too similar in colour to the marbles...These half-dozen elementary errors were pointed out by everyone in the Museum, and by many scholars outside, when the building was projected.<ref>Ashmole (1994), 126</ref></blockquote> It was not until the 1980s that the installation of a lighting scheme removed his greatest criticism of the building.}}\n\nBy the 1970s the museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition \"Treasures of [[Tutankhamun]]\" in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of [[manuscripts]] and printed books from the British Museum. This left the museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints & drawings; and [[ethnography]]. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra 1{{fraction|1|4}} miles of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.\n\n===The Great Court emerges (1975\u20132000)===\nThe departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] 19th-century central quadrangle into the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] \u2013 the largest covered square in Europe \u2013 which opened in 2000. The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived [[Museum of Mankind]] at [[6 Burlington Gardens]] from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries in the museum in 2000.\n\nThe museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in \"modern\" objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as [[New Guinea]], [[Madagascar]], [[Romania]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Indonesia]] and there were excavations in the [[Near East]], Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The [[Weston family|Weston]] Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered [[hoard]]s which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes.<ref>Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 327</ref>\n\n===The British Museum today===\nToday the museum no longer houses collections of [[natural history]], and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over thirteen million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and 150 million at the British Library.\n\nThe [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], which was designed by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]], opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]]. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore [[Annenberg Foundation|Annenberg]] Centre.\n\nWith the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the demolition for [[Lord Foster]]'s glass-roofed [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]] could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Sainsbury]] family \u2013 with the donation valued at \u00a325 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/africa/room_25_africa.aspx |title=Room 25: Africa |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs part of its very large website, the museum has the largest [[online database]] of objects in the collection of any museum in the world, with 2,000,000 individual object entries, 650,000 of them illustrated, online at the start of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database.aspx |title=Search the collection database |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> There is also a \"Highlights\" database with longer entries on over 4,000 objects, and several specialised online research catalogues and online journals (all free to access).<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights.aspx Highlights] British Museum, [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues.aspx online research catalogues] British Museum and [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_journals.aspx online journals] British Museum</ref> In 2013 the museum's website received 19.5 millions visits, an increase of 47% from the previous year.<ref name=\"BBC_museum#\" />\n\nIn 2013 the museum received a record 6.7 million visitors, an increase of 20% from the previous year.<ref name=\"BBC_museum#\">{{Cite news| title=British Museum gets record 6.7m visitors for 2013| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-25729616| newspaper=BBC News| accessdate=20 March 2014| date=2014-01-14}}</ref> Popular exhibitions including \"Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum\" and \"Ice Age Art\" are credited with helping fuel the increase in visitors.<ref name=Smithers_tourists>{{Cite news| last=Smithers| first=Rebecca| title=Sunny weather drew record numbers to UK's outdoor tourist hotspots in 2013| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/05/sunny-weather-record-uk-tourists-2013| newspaper=The Guardian| date=2014-03-05}}</ref> Plans were announced in September 2014 to recreate the entire building along with all exhibits in the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'' in conjunction with members of the public.<ref>{{Cite news| title=British Museum to be digitally recreated in Minecraft| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29281051| last1=Miller| first1=Joe| newspaper=BBC News |date=22 September 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe British Museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport|Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]] through a three-year funding agreement.

Work was also progressing on the northern half of the West Wing (The Egyptian Sculpture Gallery) 1826\u20131831, with [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] demolished in 1842 to make room for the final part of the West Wing, completed in 1846, and the South Wing with its great colonnade, initiated in 1843 and completed in 1847, when the Front Hall and Great Staircase were opened to the public.<ref>Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill & Christopher Date 1999</ref> The museum is faced with [[Portland stone]], but the perimeter walls and other parts of the building were built using [[Haytor]] granite from Dartmoor in South Devon, transported via the unique [[Haytor Granite Tramway]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/department/collections/RockRoom/building.htm| title=Building London| publisher=[[University College London]]| accessdate=4 July 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207201115/http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/department/collections/RockRoom/building.htm| archivedate=7 December 2009| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:BM; 'MF' RM1 - The King's Library, Enlightenment 1 'Discovering the world in the 18th Century ~ View South.jpg|The Enlightenment Gallery at museum, which formerly held the [[King's Library]], 2007|thumb|left]]\n[[File:BM; Archives - Impression of the proposed extension.jpg|thumb|left|Proposed British Museum Extension, 1906]]\n[[File:British Museum Great Court roof.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[British Museum Reading Room|Reading Room]] and [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]] roof, 2005]]\n[[File:BM WCEC July 2015.JPG|thumb|left|External view of the World Conservation and Exhibition Centre at the museum, 2015]]\n\nIn 1846 Robert Smirke was replaced as the museum's architect by his brother [[Sydney Smirke]], whose major addition was the [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]] 1854\u20131857; at {{convert|140|ft|m}} in diameter it was then the second widest dome in the world, the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome being slightly wider.\n\nThe next major addition was the White Wing 1882\u20131884 added behind the eastern end of the South Front, the architect being Sir [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]].\n\nIn 1895, Parliament gave the museum trustees a loan of \u00a3200,000 to purchase from the Duke of Bedford all 69 houses which backed onto the museum building in the five surrounding streets \u2013 Great Russell Street, Montague Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square and Bloomsbury Street.<ref>Title deed of the 'perimeter properties' of The British Museum, BM Archives CA TD</ref> The trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build around the west, north and east sides of the museum new galleries that would completely fill the block on which the museum stands. The architect Sir [[John James Burnet]] was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906\u201314 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1914. They now house the museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.\n\nThe [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Duveen]] Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek & Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architect [[John Russell Pope]]. Although completed in 1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22 years, before reopening in 1962. Other areas damaged during [[World War II]] bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several incendiaries fell on the south-west corner of the museum, destroying the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries around the top of the Great Staircase \u2013 this damage was not fully repaired until the early 1960s.<ref>pp. 65\u201366, Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill & Christopher Date 1999</ref>\n\nThe [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] Great Court is a covered square at the centre of the British Museum designed by the engineers [[Buro Happold]] and the architects [[Foster and Partners]].<ref>Norman Foster and the British Museum, Norman Foster, Deyan Sudjic & Spencer de Grey 2001</ref> The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe.

Together, they illustrate every aspect of the cultures of the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] (including [[Nubia]]), from the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic]] [[Neolithic]] period (c. 10,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]]) through to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic (Christian)]] times (12th century [[Anno Domini|AD]]), a time-span over 11,000 years.\n\n[[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquities]] have formed part of the British Museum collection ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian objects<ref>Reported in the list of Sloane's collection given to his executors in 1753. Reproduced in MacGregor (1994a:29)</ref> from Sir [[Hans Sloane]]. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French]] forces under [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the [[British army]] and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed [[Rosetta Stone]], were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] as [[Consul general|consul]] in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Giovanni Belzoni]]. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]].\n\nBy 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] under the efforts of [[E. A. Wallis Budge|E.A. Wallis Budge]]. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from [[Amarna]], [[Bubastis]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]]. Other organisations and individuals also excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including [[Flinders Petrie]]'s Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, as well as the [[Oxford University]] Expedition to [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] and [[Faras]] in Sudan.\n\n[[File:England; London - The British Museum, Egypt Egyptian Sculpture ~ Colossal granite head of Amenhotep III (Room 4).2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Room 4 \u2013 [[Colossal red granite statue of Amenhotep III]], 1350 BC]]\nActive support by the museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including [[Asyut]] (1907), [[El-Badari|Mostagedda]] and [[El-Badari|Matmar]] (1920s), [[Ashmunein]] (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as [[Soba (city)|Soba]], Kawa and the Northern Dongola Reach (1990s).

Other fieldwork collections have recently come from Dietrich and Rosemarie Klemm ([[University of Munich]]) and William Adams ([[University of Kentucky]]).\n\nThe seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The second-floor galleries have a selection of the museum's collection of 140 [[Mummy|mummies]] and coffins, the largest outside [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo]]. A high proportion of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought-after exhibits by visitors to the museum.\n\nThough not a part of Ancient Egypt but rather part of the wider modern Egypt project, in May 2018, the British Museum added the boots of Egyptian footballer, [[Mohamed Salah|Mo Salah]]. The boots were added to the Egypt collection because of his historical achievement of scoring 32 goals in a 38-game season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/17/mo-salah-scores-boots-enter--british-museum-collection-liverpool-egypt|title=Mo Salah scores again as boots enter British Museum collection|last=Brown|first=Mark|date=17 May 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n[[File:TombofNebamun-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Room 61 \u2013 The famous false fresco 'Pond in a Garden' from the [[Tomb of Nebamun]], c. 1350 BC]]\n[[File:Rosetta Stone.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Room 4 \u2013 The [[Rosetta Stone]], key to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs, 196 BC]]\n'''Predynastic and Early Dynastic period (c. 6000 BC \u2013 c. 2690 BC)'''\n*Mummy of [[Gebelein predynastic mummies|''Ginger'']] from Gebelein, (c. 3400 BC)\n*The [[Battlefield Palette]] and [[Hunters Palette]], two cosmetic palettes with complex decorative schemes, (c. 3100 BC)\n*Stela of King [[Peribsen]], Abydos, (c. 2720\u20132710 BC)\n\n'''Old Kingdom (2690\u20132181 BC)'''\n*Granite statue of Ankhwa, the shipbuilder, [[Saqqara]], Egypt, 3rd Dynasty, (around 2650 BC)\n*Several of the original casing stones from the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], (c. 2570 BC)\n*Wooden tomb statue of Tjeti, Fifth to Sixth Dynasty, (about 2345\u20132181 BC)\n\n'''Middle Kingdom (2134\u20131690 BC)'''\n*Inner and outer coffin of Sebekhetepi, [[Beni Hasan]], (about 2125\u20131795 BC)\n*Limestone stela of Heqaib, [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], Egypt, 12th Dynasty, (1990\u20131750 BC)\n*Block statue and stela of Sahathor, 12th Dynasty, reign of [[Amenemhat II]], (about 1922\u20131878 BC)\n\n'''New Kingdom (1549\u20131069 BC)'''\n*Fragment of the beard of the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], (14th century BC)\n*[[Colossal quartzite statue of Amenhotep III|Colossal head from a statue]] of Amenhotep III, (1350 BC)\n*Colossal limestone bust of [[Amenhotep III]], (1350 BC)\n*[[Amarna letters|Amarna Tablets]], 99 out of 382 [[Clay tablet|tablets]] found, second greatest collection in the world after the Vorderasiatisches Museum, [[Berlin]] (203 tablets), (1350 BC)\n*[[List of pharaohs|List of the kings]] of Egypt from the [[Abydos, Egypt|Temple of Ramesses II]], (1250 BC)\n\n'''Third Intermediate Period (1069\u2013664 BC)'''\n*Mummy case and coffin of Nesperennub, [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], (c.800 BC)\n*[[Statues of Amun in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa|Statue of Amun]] in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa, (683 BC)\n*Inner and outer coffins of the priest Hor, Deir el-Bahari, Thebes, 25th Dynasty, (about 680 BC)\n\n'''Late Period (664\u2013332 BC)'''\n*Saite Sarcophagus of Satsobek, the vizier (prime minister) of the northern part of Egypt in the reign of [[Psammetichus I]], (664\u2013610 BC)\n*Bronze figure of Isis and Horus, North [[Saqqara]], Egypt, (600 BC)\n*[[Obelisks of Nectanebo II|Obelisks]] and sarcophagus of Pharaoh [[Nectanebo II]], (360\u2013343 BC)\n\n'''Ptolemaic dynasty (305\u201330 BC)'''\n*The famous [[Rosetta Stone]], trilingual stela that unlocked the ancient Egyptian civilisation, (196 BC)\n*Giant sculpture of a [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetle]], (32\u201330 BC)\n*Mummy of [[Hornedjitef]] (inner coffin), Thebes, (3rd century BC)\n\n'''Roman Period (30 BC-641 AD)'''\n*The Meriotic [[Hamadab Stela]] from the [[Kingdom of Kush]] found near the ancient site of Mero\u00eb in Sudan, 24 BC\n*Lid of the coffin of Soter and Cleopatra from Qurna, Thebes, (early 2nd century AD)\n*Mummy of a youth with a portrait of the deceased, [[Hawara]], (100\u2013200 AD)\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"190px\">\nFile:Bm-ginger.jpg|Room 64 -

RM21, Mausoleum of Halikarnassos.JPG|thumb|Room 21 \u2013 [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], mid-4th century BC]]\nThe British Museum has one of the world's largest and most comprehensive collections of antiquities from the [[Classical antiquity|Classical world]], with over 100,000 objects. These mostly range in date from the beginning of the [[Bronze Age|Greek Bronze Age]] (about 3200 BC) to the establishment of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, with the [[Edict of Milan]] under the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]] in 313 AD. Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the Classical world, chief among them for the museum were [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]], [[John Turtle Wood]], [[Robert Murdoch Smith]] and [[Charles Fellows]].\n\nThe Greek objects originate from across the Ancient Greek world, from the mainland of Greece and the Aegean Islands, to neighbouring lands in Asia Minor and Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean and as far as the western lands of [[Magna Graecia]] that include Sicily and southern Italy. The [[Cyclades|Cycladic]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cultures are represented, and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] collection includes important sculpture from the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, as well as elements of two of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] and the [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]].\n\nBeginning from the early [[Bronze Age]], the department also houses one of the widest-ranging collections of [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] antiquities outside Italy, as well as extensive groups of material from [[Ancient history of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and non-Greek colonies in [[Lycia]] and [[Caria]] on Asia Minor. There is some material from the [[Roman Republic]], but the collection's strength is in its comprehensive array of objects from across the [[Roman Empire]], with the exception of Britain (which is the mainstay of the Department of Prehistory and Europe).\n\nThe collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] (many from graves in southern Italy that were once part of [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]'s and [[Edm\u00e9-Antoine Durand|Chevalier Durand]]'s collections), [[Glass|Roman glass]] including the famous [[Cameo glass]] Portland Vase, [[Roman mosaic]]s from [[Carthage]] and [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] in North Africa that were excavated by [[Nathan Davis (traveller)|Nathan Davis]], and silver hoards from [[Roman Gaul]] (some of which were bequeathed by the philanthropist and museum trustee [[Richard Payne Knight]]), are particularly important. Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have benefited from the purchase of Sir [[Robert Hamilton Lang]]'s collection as well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the [[Charles Townley#Townley Collection|Townley collection]] as well as residual sculptures from the famous [[Farnese collection]].\n\nObjects from the Department of Greece and Rome are located throughout the museum, although many of the [[architectural]] monuments are to be found on the ground floor, with connecting galleries from Gallery 5 to Gallery 23. On the upper floor, there are galleries devoted to smaller material from ancient Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the Roman Empire.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n[[Parthenon]]\n*The [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles (Elgin Marbles)]], (447\u2013438 BC)\n\n[[Erechtheion]]\n*A surviving column, (420\u2013415 BC)\n*One of six remaining [[Caryatid]]s, (415 BC)\n\nTemple of [[Athena Nike]]\n*Surviving [[frieze]] slabs, (427\u2013424 BC)\n\nTemple of [[Bassae]]\n*Twenty-three surviving blocks of the [[Bassae Frieze|frieze]] from the interior of the temple, (420\u2013400 BC)\n\n[[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]]\n*Two colossal free-standing figures identified as Maussollos and his wife [[Artemisia I of Caria|Artemisia]], (c. 350 BC)\n*Part of an impressive horse from the [[chariot]] group adorning the summit of the [[Mausoleum]], (c. 350 BC)\n*The [[Amazonomachy]] frieze \u2013 A long section of relief frieze showing the battle between Greeks and [[Amazons]], (c. 350 BC)\n\n[[Temple of Artemis in Ephesus]]\n*One of the sculptured column bases, (340\u2013320 BC)\n*Part of the [[Ionic order|Ionic]] frieze situated above the colonnade, (330\u2013300 BC)\n\n[[Knidos]] in Asia Minor\n*[[Demeter of Knidos]], (350 BC)\n*[[Lion of Knidos]], (350\u2013200 BC)\n\n[[Xanthos]] in Asia Minor\n*Lion Tomb, (550\u2013500 BC)\n*[[Harpy Tomb]], (480\u2013470 BC)\n*[[Nereid Monument]], partial reconstruction of a large and elaborate Lykian tomb, (390\u2013380 BC)\n*Tomb of Merehi, (390\u2013350 BC)\n*[[Tomb of Payava]], (375\u2013350 BC)\n\n'''Wider collection'''\n\n'''Prehistoric Greece and Italy (3300 BC \u2013 8th century BC)'''\n*Over thirty [[Cycladic art|Cycladic figures]] from islands in the Aegean Sea, many collected by [[James Theodore Bent]], Greece, (3300\u20132000 BC)\n*Material from the [[Knossos|Palace of Knossos]] including a huge pottery storage jar, some donated by Sir [[Arthur Evans]], Crete, Greece, (1900\u20131100 BC)\n*The Minoan gold treasure from [[Aegina Treasure|Aegina]], northern Aegean, Greece, (1850\u20131550 BC)\n*Segments of the columns and architraves from the [[Treasury of Atreus]], Peloponnese, Greece, (1350\u20131250 BC)\n*[[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Elgin]] Amphora, highly decorated pottery vase attributed to the [[Dipylon Master]], Athens, Greece, (8th century BC)\n*[[Bronze Statuette of Athletic Spartan Girl]]\n\n'''Etruscan (8th century BC \u2013 1st century BC)'''\n*Some of the artefacts from the Castellani Tomb in [[Palestrina]], central Italy, (8th\u20136th century BC)\n*Contents of the [[Isis Tomb, Vulci]], (570\u2013560 BC)\n*Painted terracotta plaques (the so-called ''Boccanera Plaques'') from a tomb in [[Cerveteri]], (560\u2013550 BC)\n*[[Oscan Tablet]], one of the most important inscriptions in the Oscan language, (300\u2013100 BC)\n*[[Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa]] from Chiusi, (150\u2013140 BC)\n\n'''Ancient Greece (8th century BC \u2013 4th century AD)'''\n*Group of life-size [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] statues from the Sacred Way at [[Didyma]], western Turkey, (600\u2013580 BC)\n*[[Priene Inscription|Dedicatory Inscription by Alexander the Great]] from Priene in Turkey (330 BC)\n*Head from the colossal statue of the [[Asclepius of Milos]], Greece, (325\u2013300 BC)\n*Bronze sculpture of a Greek poet known as the [[Arundel Head]], western Turkey, (2nd\u20131st centuries BC)\n*Remains of the [[Scylla]] monument at [[Bargylia]], south west Anatolia, Turkey, (200\u2013150 BC)\n\n'''Ancient Rome (1st century BC \u2013 4th century AD)'''\n*Cameo glass [[Portland Vase]], the most famous glass vessel from ancient Rome, (1\u201325 AD)\n*Silver [[Warren Cup]] with homoerotic scenes, found near Jerusalem, (5\u201315 AD)\n*[[Discobolus|Discus-thrower (Discobolos)]]<ref>Tony Kitto, \"The celebrated connoisseur: Charles Townley, 1737\u20131805\" ''Minerva Magazine'' May/June 2005, in connection with a British Museum exhibition celebrating the bicentennial of the Townley purchase.

A collection of immense importance, the holdings of [[Assyrian sculpture]], [[Babylonia]]n and [[Sumer]]ian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] from [[Nimrud]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Khorsabad]].\n\nThe collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These cover [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], parts of Central Asia, [[Syria]], the [[Holy Land]] and [[Phoenicia]]n settlements in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] from the [[Prehistory|prehistoric period]] and include objects from the beginning of [[Islam]] in the 7th century.\n\nThe first significant addition of [[Mesopotamian]] objects was from the collection of [[Claudius James Rich]] in 1825. The collection was later dramatically enlarged by the excavations of [[Austen Henry Layard|A. H. Layard]] at the [[Assyria]]n sites of [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]] between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]], as well as three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace of [[Sennacherib]] at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result, a large numbers of [[Lamassu]]'s, palace reliefs, [[Stele|stelae]], including the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]], were brought to the British Museum.\n[[File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 14 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's & Full Projection.3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Room 6 \u2013 Pair of [[Lamassu|Human Headed Winged Lions]] and reliefs from [[Nimrud]] with the [[Balawat Gates]], c. 860 BC]]\n\n[[File:London 307.JPG|thumb|Room 52 \u2013 Ancient Iran with the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], considered to be the world's first charter of [[human rights]], 559\u2013530 BC]]\nLayard's work was continued by his assistant, [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and in 1852\u20131854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' and [[Lachish relief]]s. He also discovered the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Royal Library of Ashurbanipal]], a large collection of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] of enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. [[William Loftus|W. K. Loftus]] excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of [[Nimrud ivories|ivories]] in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] from [[Babylon]], the bronze gates from [[Balawat]], important objects from [[Sippar]], and a fine collection of [[Urartu|Urartian]] bronzes from [[Toprakkale]].\n\nIn the early 20th century excavations were carried out at [[Carchemish]], [[Turkey]] by [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] and [[Leonard Woolley]], the latter assisted by [[T. E. Lawrence]]. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern [[Iraq]] after the [[First World War]]. From [[Ubaid period|Tell al-Ubaid]] came the bronze furnishings of a [[Sumer]]ian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|H. R. Hall]] in 1919\u201324. Woolley went on to excavate [[Ur]] between 1922 and 1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the '[[Standard of Ur]]', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the '[[Royal Game of Ur]]', and two bull-headed [[lyres]]. The department also has three [[diorite]] statues of the ruler [[Statues of Gudea|Gudea]] from the ancient state of [[Lagash]] and a series of limestone [[kudurru]] or boundary stones from different locations across ancient [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nAlthough the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The [[Achaemenid]] collection was enhanced with the addition of the [[Oxus Treasure]] in 1897 and objects excavated by the German scholar [[Ernst Herzfeld]] and the Hungarian-British explorer [[Marc Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of [[Persepolis]] were donated by Sir [[Gore Ouseley]] in 1825 and the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 5th Earl of Aberdeen|5th Earl of Aberdeen]] in 1861. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the greatest assemblages of Achaemenid [[Household silver|silverware]] in the world. The later [[Sasanian Empire]] is also well represented by ornate silver plates and cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer. Phoenician antiquities come from across the region, but the [[Tharros]] collection from [[Sardinia]] and the large number of Phoenician stelae from [[Carthage]] are outstanding. Another often overlooked highlight is [[Ancient history of Yemen|Yemeni]] antiquities, the finest collection outside that country. Furthermore, the museum has a representative collection of [[Dilmun]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] material excavated from various burial mounds at the ancient sites of [[A'ali]] and [[Shakhura]] in Bahrain.\n\nFrom the modern state of [[Syria]] come almost forty funerary busts from [[Palmyra]] and a group of stone [[reliefs]] from the excavations of [[Max von Oppenheim]] at [[Tell Halaf]] that was purchased in 1920. More material followed from the excavations of [[Max Mallowan]] at [[Chagar Bazar]] and [[Tell Brak]] in 1935\u20131938 and from Woolley at [[Alalakh]] in the years just before and after the [[Second World War]]. Mallowan returned with his wife [[Agatha Christie]] to carry out further digs at Nimrud in the postwar period which secured many [[Nimrud Ivories|important artefacts]] for the museum. The collection of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] material was strengthened by the work of [[Kathleen Kenyon]] at [[Jericho]] in the 1950s and the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at [[Lachish]] by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932\u20131938.  Archaeological digs are still taking place where permitted in the Middle East, and, depending on the country, the museum continues to receive a share of the finds from sites such as [[:de:Tell es-Sa'idiyeh|Tell es Sa'idiyeh]] in Jordan.\n\nThe museum's collection of [[Islamic art]], including archaeological material, numbers about 40,000 objects,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pm_partner.php?id=Mus01;uk&type=museum&theme=ISL&|title=Museum With No Frontiers| publisher=Discover Islamic Art| accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> one of the largest of its kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of pottery, paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions from across the Islamic world, from [[Spain]] in the west to [[India]] in the east. It is particularly famous for its collection of [[\u0130znik pottery|Iznik]] ceramics (the largest in the world), a highlight of which is the mosque lamp from the [[Dome of the Rock]], mediaeval metalwork such as the Vaso Vescovali with its depictions of the [[Zodiac]], a fine selection of [[astrolabes]], and [[Mughal paintings]] and precious artwork including a large [[Jade Terrapin from Allahabad|jade terrapin]] made for the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Thousands of objects were excavated after the war by professional archaeologists at Iranian sites such as [[Siraf]] by [[David Whitehouse]] and [[Alamut Castle]] by Peter Willey. The collection was augmented in 1983 by the [[Frederick DuCane Godman|Godman]] bequest of Iznik, [[Hispano-Moresque]] and early Iranian pottery. Artefacts from the Islamic world are on display in Gallery 34 of the museum.\n\nA representative selection from the Department of Middle East, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries throughout the museum and total some 4,500 objects. A whole suite of rooms on the ground floor display the sculptured reliefs from the Assyrian palaces at Nineveh, Nimrud and Khorsabad, while 8 galleries on the upper floor hold smaller material from ancient sites across the [[Middle East]]. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] from Mesopotamia.<ref>{{cite web

Key benefactors to the department have been [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]], [[Richard Payne Knight]], John Malcolm, [[Campbell Dodgson]], C\u00e9sar Mange de Hauke and [[Tom\u00e1s Harris]].\n\nThere are groups of drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], (including [[Epifania (Michelangelo drawing)|his only surviving full-scale cartoon]]), [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in existence), [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] and [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], and largely complete collections of the works of all the great printmakers including [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] (99 [[engraving]]s, 6 [[etching]]s and most of his 346 [[woodcut]]s), Rembrandt and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]. More than 30,000 British drawings and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] include important examples of work by [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[Paul Sandby|Sandby]], [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], [[Thomas Girtin|Girtin]], [[John Constable|Constable]], [[John Sell Cotman|Cotman]], [[David Cox (artist)|Cox]], [[James Gillray|Gillray]], [[Thomas Rowlandson|Rowlandson]] and [[George Cruikshank|Cruikshank]], as well as all the great [[Victorian era|Victorians]]. There are about a million British prints including more than 20,000 satires and outstanding collections of works by [[William Blake]] and [[Thomas Bewick]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The great eleven volume [[Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum]] compiled between 1870 and 1954 is the definitive reference work for the study of British Satirical prints. Over 500,000 objects from the department are now on the online collection database, many with high quality images.<ref>Searches on 8 January 2012, return totals of 700,000, but many are in other departments</ref> A 2011 donation of \u00a31 million enabled the museum to acquire a complete set of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Vollard Suite]]''.<ref name=\"TelegNov11\">{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8923722/City-fund-manager-in-1m-Picasso-giveaway.html| title=City fund manager in \u00a31m Picasso giveaway| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| first=Anita |last=Singh| accessdate=19 May 2012| date=29 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"190px\">\nFile:Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait of a Young Woman - WGA25729.jpg|[[Rogier van der Weyden]] - Portrait of a Young Woman, c. 1440\nFile:A fool, seated on a basket, about to be shaved by a nun holding a wafer iron by Hieronymus Bosch.jpg|[[Hieronymus Bosch]] - A comical barber scene, c. 1477-1516\nFile:Botticelli, allegoria dell'abbondanza, disegno.jpg|[[Sandro Botticelli]] - Allegory of Abundance, 1480-1485\nFile:Leonardo da vinci, Study for the Burlington House Cartoon.jpg|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] \u2013 The [[Islamic views of Mary|Virgin]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Child]] with [[Saint Anne]] and the Infant Saint [[John the Baptist]] (prep for '[[The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist|The Burlington House Cartoon]]'), c. 1499\u20131500\nFile:Adam study - Michelangelo.jpg|[[Michelangelo]] \u2013 Studies of a reclining male nude: [[Adam]] in the fresco [[The Creation of Adam|'The Creation of Man']] on the vault of the [[Sistine Chapel]], c. 1511\nFile:Raffaello, studio di testa di madonna e bambino.jpg|[[Raphael]] \u2013 Study of Heads, Mother and Child, c. 1509-11\nFile:Titian - Drowning of the Pharaoh's Host in the Red Sea - WGA22989.jpg|[[Titian]] \u2013 [[Crossing the Red Sea|Drowning of the Pharaoh's Host in the Red Sea]], 1515\u201317\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Walrus - WGA07101.jpg|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] - Drawing of a walrus, 1521\nFile:A Lady, called Anne Boleyn, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]] - Portrait of Anne Boleyn, 1536\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens 077.jpg|[[Peter Paul Rubens]] - Drawing of a lioness, c. 1614-1615\nFile:Head of a monk, 1625-64, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n.

It includes some of the earliest objects made by humans in east Africa over 2 million years ago, as well as [[Prehistoric]] and neolithic objects from other parts of the world; and the art and archaeology of Europe from the earliest times to the present day. Archeological excavation of prehistoric material took off and expanded considerably in the twentieth century and the department now has literally millions of objects from the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods throughout the world, as well as from the [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron age]] in Europe. Stone Age material from Africa has been donated by famous archaeologists such as [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]], and [[Gertrude Caton\u2013Thompson]]. Paleolithic objects from the [[William Allen Sturge|Sturge]], [[Henry Christy|Christy]] and [[\u00c9douard Lartet|Lartet]] collections include some of the earliest works of art from Europe. Many Bronze Age objects from across Europe were added during the nineteenth century, often from large collections built up by excavators and scholars such as [[William Greenwell|Greenwell]] in Britain, [[Thomas Tobin|Tobin]] and Cooke in Ireland, [[William Collings Lukis|Lukis]] and de la Granci\u00e8re in Brittany, [[Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae|Worsaae]] in Denmark, [[Luis Siret|Siret]] at [[El Argar]] in Spain, and [[Gustav Klemm|Klemm]] and Edelmann in Germany. A representative selection of Iron Age artefacts from [[Hallstatt]] were acquired as a result of the [[Sir John Evans|Evans]]/[[Sir John Lubbock|Lubbock]] excavations and from [[Giubiasco]] in [[Ticino]] through the [[Swiss National Museum]].\n\nIn addition, the British Museum's collections covering the period AD 300 to 1100 are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world, extending from Spain to the [[Black Sea]] and from North Africa to [[Scandinavia]]; a representative selection of these has recently been redisplayed in a newly refurbished gallery. Important collections include [[Latvia]]n, [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Gotland]]ic and [[Merovingian]] material from [[Johann Karl B\u00e4hr]], Alfred Heneage Cocks, Sir James Curle and Philippe Delamain respectively. However, the undoubted highlight from the early mediaeval period are the magnificent items from the [[Sutton Hoo]] royal grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner [[Edith Pretty]]. The department includes the national collection of [[horology]] with one of the most wide-ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces came from the [[Octavius Morgan|Morgan]] and [[Courtenay Adrian Ilbert|Ilbert]] collections. The department is also responsible for the curation of [[Romano-British]] objects \u2013 the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside [[Italy]]. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in [[East Anglia]], the most important of which is the [[Mildenhall Treasure]]. The museum purchased many Roman-British objects from the antiquarian [[Charles Roach Smith]] in 1856.  These quickly formed the nucleus of the collection.\n\nObjects from the Department of Prehistory and Europe are mostly found on the upper floor of the museum, with a suite of galleries numbered from 38 to 51. Most of the collection is stored in its [[archive]] facilities, where it is available for [[research]] and study.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n'''Stone Age (c. 3.4 million years BC

[[Sir Percival David, 2nd Baronet|Percival David]] collection of Chinese ceramics]]\nThe scope of the Department of Asia is extremely broad; its collections of over 75,000 objects cover the material culture of the whole Asian continent (from East, South, Central and South-East Asia) and from the Neolithic up to the present day. Until recently, this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the [[British Empire]], especially the Indian subcontinent. Examples include the collections made by individuals such as [[Hindu Stuart|Charles Stuart]], [[James Prinsep]], [[Charles Masson]], Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], Sir [[Harold Arthur Deane|Harold Deane]] and Sir [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]]. A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo-Greek banker [[George Eumorfopoulos]] in the 1930s. In the second half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the [[philanthropist]] PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection.<ref>{{cite web|author=Babs.Guthrie|url=http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|title=Collection page|publisher=Untold London|accessdate=4 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921153753/http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|archivedate=21 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html|title=Embassy of Japan in the UK|publisher=Japan Embassy|accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/asia.aspx |title=Department of Asia|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and [[hunter-gatherers]], many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] (much assembled by the British naval officer [[Maurice Vidal Portman|Maurice Portman]]), Sri Lanka (especially through the colonial administrator [[Hugh Nevill]]), Northern Thailand, south-west China, the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of Hokaidu in Japan (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist [[John Anderson (zoologist)|John Anderson]]), Siberia and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited from the purchase in 1905 of the [[Sarawak]] collection put together by Dr [[Charles Hose]], as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A Jeffreys.

Many individuals have added to the department's collection over the years but those assembled by [[Henry Christy]], [[Harry Geoffrey Beasley|Harry Beasley]] and [[William Ockelford Oldman|William Oldman]] are outstanding. Objects from this department are mostly on display in several galleries on the ground and lower floors. Gallery 24 displays [[ethnographic]] from every continent while adjacent galleries focus on [[North America]] and [[Mexico]]. A long suite of rooms (Gallery 25) on the lower floor display African art. There are plans in place to develop permanent galleries for showcasing art from Oceania and South America.\n\n'''Africa'''\n[[File:African_throwing_knives.jpg|thumb|left|Room 25 \u2013 Collection of African [[Throwing knife|throwing knives]]]]\nThe Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir [[Henry Wellcome]], which was donated by the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Historical Medical Museum]] in 1954. Highlights of the African collection include objects found at [[Senegambian stone circles|megalithic circles]] in The Gambia, a dozen exquisite [[Kongo ivories#Afro-Portuguese ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]], a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Asante goldwork and regalia from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in west Africa, the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]] and [[Igbo-Ukwu]] bronze sculptures, the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler and quartz throne from [[Ife]], a similar [[terracotta]] head from Iwinrin Grove near Ife, the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, an [[Ikom monoliths|Ikom monolith]] from [[Cross River State]], the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry from the [[Kuba Kingdom]] including three [[Ndop (Kuba)|royal figures]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, processional crosses and other ecclesiastical and royal material from [[Gondar]] and [[Amba Mariam|Magdala]], Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] (that includes a unique soapstone, [[anthropomorphic]] figure) and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the [[Venda]] peoples and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].\n\n'''Oceania'''\n\nThe British Museum's Oceanic collections originate from the vast area of the [[Pacific Ocean]], stretching from Papua New Guinea to Easter Island, from New Zealand to Hawaii. The three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]] \u2013 Aboriginal art from [[Australia]] is considered separately in its own right.  Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. Prehistoric objects from the region include a bird-shaped [[pestle]] and a group of stone [[Pestle and mortar|mortars]] from [[Papua New Guinea]]. The British Museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest Oceanic and Pacific collections, many of which were put together by members of [[James Cook|Cook]]'s and [[George Vancouver|Vancouver]]'s expeditions or by colonial administrators such as Sir [[George Grey]], Sir [[Frederick Broome]] and [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Gordon]], before Western culture significantly impacted on indigenous cultures. The [[Henry Wilson (sailor)|Wilson]] cabinet of curiosities from [[Palau]] is another example of pre-contact ware. The department has also benefited greatly from the legacy of pioneering [[anthropology|anthropologists]] such as [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] and [[Katherine Routledge]]. In addition, the [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]] collection is the finest outside New Zealand with many intricately carved wooden and [[Hei-tiki|jade objects]] and the [[Aboriginal art]] collection is distinguished by its wide range of [[bark paintings]], including two very early bark etchings collected by [[John Hunter Kerr]]. A poignant artefact is the wooden shield found near [[Botany Bay]] during Cook's first voyage in 1770. A particularly important group of objects was purchased from the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1911, that includes the unique [[statue of A'a from Rurutu]] Island, the rare [[Mangareva Statue|idol]] from the isle of Mangareva and the Cook Islands [[Deity Figure from Rarotonga|deity figure]].  Other highlights include the huge Hawaiian statue of [[K\u016b|K\u016b-ka-ili-moku]] or god of war (one of three extant in the world) and the famous Easter Island statues [[Hoa Hakananai'a]] and [[Relocation of moai objects|Moai Hava]].\n\n'''Americas'''\nThe Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items although the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Moche culture|Moche]], [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Taino]] and other early cultures are well represented. The [[Kayung totem pole]], which was made in the late nineteenth century in the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], dominates the Great Court and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide-ranging collections that stretches from the very north of the North American continent where the [[Inuit]] population has lived for centuries, to the tip of South America where indigenous tribes have long thrived in Patagonia. Highlights of the collection include [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal Canadian]] objects from Alaska and Canada collected by the [[Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale|5th Earl of Lonsdale]] and the [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquis of Lorne]], the [[E. G. Squier|Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis|Davis]] collection of prehistoric mound relics from North America, a selection of pottery vessels found in cliff-dwellings at [[Mesa Verde]], a collection of turquoise Aztec [[Double-headed serpent|mosaics]] from Mexico (the largest in Europe), important artefacts from [[Teotihuacan Ocelot|Teotihuacan]] and [[Isla de Sacrificios]], several rare pre-Columbian manuscripts including the [[Codex Zouche-Nuttall]] and [[Codex Waecker-Gotter]], a spectacular series of Mayan [[Yaxchilan Lintel 24|lintels]] from [[Yaxchilan]] excavated by the British Mayanist [[Alfred Maudslay]], a very high quality Mayan collection that includes sculptures from [[Cop\u00e1n Bench Panel|Copan]], [[Tikal Temple I|Tikal]], [[Tulum Stela 1|Tulum]], [[Pusilha]], [[Naranjo]] and [[Nebaj]] (including the celebrated [[Fenton Vase]]), a group of [[Zemi Figures from Vere, Jamaica]], a number of prestigious pre-Columbian gold and [[Lake Guatavita|votive]] objects from Colombia, ethnographic objects from across the Amazon region including the [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk|Schomburgk]] collection, two rare [[Tiwanaku]] pottery vessels from [[Lake Titicaca]] and important items from [[Tierra del Fuego]] donated by Commander [[Phillip Parker King]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"190px\">\nFile:British Museum otter pipe.jpg|Room 26 - Stone pipe representing an otter from [[Hopewell Culture National Historical Park|Mound City]], Ohio, USA, 200 BC - 400 AD\nFile:British Museum tomb guardian.jpg|Room 2 - Stone tomb guardian, part human part jaguar, from [[San Agust\u00edn, Huila|San Agust\u00edn]], Colombia, c. 300-600 AD\nFile:Maya maize god statue.jpg|Room 1 - Maya maize god statue from [[Cop\u00e1n]], Honduras, 600-800 AD\nFile:Gold Lime Flasks (poporos) Quimbaya Culture, Colombia AD 600-1100 - British Museum.jpg|Room 24 - Gold Lime Flasks (poporos), [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya Culture]], Colombia, 600-1100 AD\nFile:Maya, lintel 25, da yaxchilan, 725.JPG|Room 27 - Lintel 25 from [[Yaxchilan]], Late Classic, Mexico, 600-900 AD\nFile:Bird pectoral, Popayan, gold alloy, AD900\u20131600..jpg|Room 24 - Bird pectoral made from gold alloy, [[Popay\u00e1n]], Colombia, 900-1600 AD\nFile:Hoa Hakananai'a - Moai in the British Museum.jpeg|Room 24 \u2013 Rapa Nui statue [[Hoa Hakananai'a]], 1000 AD, [[Wellcome Trust]] Gallery\nFile:Denis Bourez - British Museum, London (8748174360).jpg|Room 27 - [[Double-headed serpent]] turquoise mosaic, Aztec, Mexico, 1400-1500 AD\nFile:Denis Bourez - British Museum, London (8747055335).jpg|Room 27 - Turquoise Mosaic Mask, [[Mixtec]]-[[Aztec]], Mexico, 1400-1500 AD\nFile:Miniature gold llama figurine.jpg|Room 2 - Miniature gold llama figurine, [[Inca]], Peru, about 1500 AD\nFile:Benin Bronzes at the British Museum 1.jpg|Room 25 - Part of the famous collection of Benin brass plaques, [[Nigeria]], 1500-1600 AD\nFile:Benin brass plaque 01.jpg|Room 25 - Detail of one of the [[Benin Empire|Benin]] brass plaques in the museum, Nigeria, 1500-1600 AD\nFile:Idia mask BM Af1910 5-13 1.jpg|Room 25 - [[Benin ivory mask]] of Queen Idia, Nigeria, 16th century AD\nFile:Hawaiian feather helmet, British Museum 3.jpg|Room 24 - Hawaiian feather helmet or [[mahiole]], late 1700s AD\nFile:British museum, totem.JPG|Great Court - Two house frontal [[Kayung totem pole|totem poles]], Haida, British Columbia, Canada, about 1850 AD\nFile:Punu mask BM Af1904 11-22 1.jpg|Room 25 - Mask (wood and pigment); Punu people, [[Gabon]], 19th century AD\nFile:Otobo masquerade.jpg|Room 25 - Otobo masquerade in the Africa Gallery, Nigeria, 20th century AD\nFile:El Anatsui - Man's Cloth.jpg|Room 25 - Modern interpretation of kente cloth from [[Ghana]], late 20th century AD\n</gallery>\n\n===Department of Coins and Medals===\n    {{main article|British Museum Department of Coins and Medals}}\n\nThe British Museum is home to one of the world's finest [[Numismatics|numismatic]] collections, comprising about a million objects, including coins, medals, tokens and paper money.

(When an exponent is zero, the corresponding power expression is taken to be 1 and this multiplicative factor is often omitted from the term.  Hence one often sees the right side written as <math>\\binom{n}{0} x^n + \\ldots</math>.) This formula is also referred to as the '''binomial formula''' or the '''binomial identity'''. Using [[Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]], it can be written as\n:<math>(x+y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k}x^{n-k}y^k = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k}x^{k}y^{n-k}.\n</math>\nThe final expression follows from the previous one by the symmetry of ''x'' and ''y'' in the first expression, and by comparison it follows that the sequence of binomial coefficients in the formula is symmetrical.\nA simple variant of the binomial formula is obtained by [[substitution (algebra)|substituting]] 1 for ''y'', so that it involves only a single [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. In this form, the formula reads\n:<math>(1+x)^n = {n \\choose 0}x^0 + {n \\choose 1}x^1 + {n \\choose 2}x^2 + \\cdots + {n \\choose {n-1}}x^{n-1} + {n \\choose n}x^n,</math>\nor equivalently\n:<math>(1+x)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k}x^k.</math>\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Pascal triangle small.png|thumb|right|300px|Pascal's triangle]]\nThe most basic example of the binomial theorem is the formula for the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of {{math|''x'' + ''y''}}:\n\n:<math>(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2.</math>\n\nThe binomial coefficients 1, 2, 1 appearing in this expansion correspond to the second row of Pascal's triangle.  (Note that the top \"1\" of the triangle is considered to be row 0, by convention.) The coefficients of higher powers of {{math|''x'' + ''y''}} correspond to lower rows of the triangle:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n(x+y)^3 & = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^4 & = x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^5 & = x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 + y^5, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^6 & = x^6 + 6x^5y + 15x^4y^2 + 20x^3y^3 + 15x^2y^4 + 6xy^5 + y^6, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^7 & = x^7 + 7x^6y + 21x^5y^2 + 35x^4y^3 + 35x^3y^4 + 21x^2y^5 + 7xy^6 + y^7.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nSeveral patterns can be observed from these examples. In general, for the expansion {{math|(''x'' + ''y'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}:\n# the powers of {{math|''x''}} start at {{mvar|n}} and decrease by 1 in each term until they reach 0 (with {{math|1=''x''<sup>0</sup> = 1}}, often unwritten);\n# the powers of {{math|''y''}} start at 0 and increase by 1 until they reach {{math|''n''}}; \n# the {{mvar|n}}th row of Pascal's Triangle will be the coefficients of the expanded binomial when the terms are arranged in this way;\n# the number of terms in the expansion before like terms are combined is the sum of the coefficients and is equal to {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>}}; and\n# there will be {{math|''n'' + 1}} terms in the expression after combining like terms in the expansion.\n\nThe binomial theorem can be applied to the powers of any binomial. For example,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n(x+2)^3 &= x^3 + 3x^2(2) + 3x(2)^2 + 2^3 \\\\\n&= x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8.\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor a binomial involving subtraction, the theorem can be applied by using the form {{math|1=(''x'' \u2212 ''y'')<sup>''n''</sup> = (''x'' + (\u2212''y''))<sup>''n''</sup>}}. This has the effect of changing the sign of every other term in the expansion:\n:<math>(x-y)^3 = (x+(-y))^3 = x^3 + 3x^2(-y) + 3x(-y)^2 + (-y)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2y + 3xy^2 -y^3.</math>\n\n=== Geometric explanation ===\n[[File:binomial_theorem_visualisation.svg|thumb|300px|Visualisation of binomial expansion up to the 4th power]]\nFor positive values of ''a'' and ''b'', the binomial theorem with ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 is the geometrically evident fact that a square of side {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}} can be cut into a square of side ''a'', a square of side ''b'', and two rectangles with sides ''a'' and ''b''.

These are usually written <math> \\tbinom nk </math>, and pronounced \u201c''n'' choose ''k''\u201d.\n\n=== Formulae ===\nThe coefficient of ''x''<sup>''n''\u2212''k''</sup>''y''<sup>''k''</sup> is given by the formula\n\n:<math>{n \\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}</math>\n\nwhich is defined in terms of the [[factorial]] function ''n''!. Equivalently, this formula can be written\n\n:<math>{n \\choose k} = \\frac{n (n-1) \\cdots (n-k+1)}{k (k-1) \\cdots 1} = \\prod_{\\ell=1}^k \\frac{n-\\ell+1}{\\ell} = \\prod_{\\ell=0}^{k-1} \\frac{n-\\ell}{k - \\ell}</math>\n\nwith ''k'' factors in both the numerator and denominator of the [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. Note that, although this formula involves a fraction, the binomial coefficient <math> \\tbinom nk </math> is actually an [[integer]].\n\n=== Combinatorial interpretation ===\nThe binomial coefficient <math> \\tbinom nk </math> can be interpreted as the number of ways to choose ''k'' elements from an ''n''-element set. This is related to binomials for the following reason: if we write (''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'')<sup>''n''</sup> as a [[Product (mathematics)|product]]\n:<math>(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)\\cdots(x+y),</math>\nthen, according to the [[distributive law]], there will be one term in the expansion for each choice of either ''x'' or ''y'' from each of the binomials of the product. For example, there will only be one term ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>, corresponding to choosing ''x'' from each binomial. However, there will be several terms of the form ''x''<sup>''n''\u22122</sup>''y''<sup>2</sup>, one for each way of choosing exactly two binomials to contribute a ''y''. Therefore, after [[combining like terms]], the coefficient of ''x''<sup>''n''\u22122</sup>''y''<sup>2</sup> will be equal to the number of ways to choose exactly 2 elements from an ''n''-element set.\n\n== Proofs ==\n\n=== Combinatorial proof ===\n\n==== Example ====\nThe coefficient of ''xy''<sup>2</sup> in\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n(x+y)^3 &= (x+y)(x+y)(x+y) \\\\\n&= xxx + xxy + xyx + \\underline{xyy} + yxx + \\underline{yxy} + \\underline{yyx} + yyy \\\\\n&= x^3 + 3x^2y + \\underline{3xy^2} + y^3.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nequals <math>\\tbinom{3}{2}=3</math> because there are three ''x'',''y'' strings of length 3 with exactly two ''y'''s, namely,\n\n:<math>xyy, \\; yxy, \\; yyx,</math>\n\ncorresponding to the three 2-element subsets of {&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3&nbsp;}, namely,\n\n:<math>\\{2,3\\},\\;\\{1,3\\},\\;\\{1,2\\}, </math>\n\nwhere each subset specifies the positions of the ''y'' in a corresponding string.\n\n==== General case ====\nExpanding (''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'')<sup>''n''</sup> yields the sum of the 2<sup>&nbsp;''n''</sup> products of the form ''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;''e''<sub>&nbsp;''n''</sub> where each ''e''<sub>&nbsp;''i''</sub> is ''x'' or&nbsp;''y''. Rearranging factors shows that each product equals ''x''<sup>''n''\u2212''k''</sup>''y''<sup>''k''</sup> for some ''k'' between 0 and&nbsp;''n''. For a given ''k'', the following are proved equal in succession:\n* the number of copies of ''x''<sup>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''k''</sup>''y''<sup>''k''</sup> in the expansion\n* the number of ''n''-character ''x'',''y'' strings having ''y'' in exactly ''k'' positions\n* the number of ''k''-element subsets of {&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n''}\n* <math>{n \\choose k}</math> (this is either by definition, or by a short combinatorial argument if one is defining <math>{n \\choose k}</math> as <math>\\frac{n!}{k!

(The same generalization also applies to [[complex number|complex]] exponents.) In this generalization, the finite sum is replaced by an [[infinite series]]. In order to do this, one needs to give meaning to binomial coefficients with an arbitrary upper index, which cannot be done using the usual formula with factorials.  However, for an arbitrary number ''r'', one can define\n\n:<math>{r \\choose k}=\\frac{r\\,(r-1) \\cdots (r-k+1)}{k!} =\\frac{(r)_k}{k!},</math>\n<!--\nThis is not the same as \\frac{r!}{k!\\,(r\u2212k)!}. Factorials are typically only defined on natural number arguments, but even if you are using factorials generalized (e.g. by the \\Gamma function) to non-integer values, they are still undefined on the negative integers. To get the usual binomial theorem as a special case of this so-called generalization, we had better define the binomial coefficient when ''r'' is an integer, but in that case ''r''\u2212''k'' will be a negative integer for sufficiently large ''k'', so one cannot use any formula involving the factorial <math>(r\u2212k)!</math>.\n\nThis negative comment about \"not the same as\u2026\" seems to be needed. People keep coming along and completing this formula with this expression involving factorials, missing the point of this section.\n~~~~perhaps someone could put a better explanation in! Here is an attempt!.\nThe problem with substituting \\frac{r!}{k!\\,(r\u2212k)!} is that the ! ends up being used for negative numbers which doesn't work with the definition of !. Consequently, the notation here is used because if you look at it for a negative value of n, the value is still defined with this notation. That being said, many text books are careless about it.\n-->\nwhere <math>(\\cdot)_k</math> is the [[Pochhammer symbol]], here standing for a [[falling factorial]].  This agrees with the usual definitions when ''r'' is a nonnegative integer.  Then, if ''x'' and ''y'' are real numbers with |''x''|&nbsp;>&nbsp;|''y''|,<ref name=convergence group=Note>This is to guarantee convergence. Depending on ''r'', the series may also converge sometimes when |''x''|&nbsp;=&nbsp;|''y''|.</ref> and ''r'' is any complex number, one has\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n(x+y)^r & =\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {r \\choose k} x^{r-k} y^k \\\\\n& = x^r + r x^{r-1} y + \\frac{r(r-1)}{2!} x^{r-2} y^2 + \\frac{r(r-1)(r-2)}{3!} x^{r-3} y^3 + \\cdots.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nWhen ''r'' is a nonnegative integer, the binomial coefficients for ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''r'' are zero, so this equation reduces to the usual binomial theorem, and there are at most  ''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 nonzero terms. For other values of ''r'', the series typically has infinitely many nonzero terms.\n\nFor example, ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/2 gives the following series for the square root:\n:<math>\\sqrt{1+x} = \\textstyle 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \\frac{1}{16}x^3 - \\frac{5}{128}x^4 + \\frac{7}{256}x^5 - \\cdots</math>\n\nTaking <math>r=-1</math>, the generalized binomial series gives the [[Geometric series#Formula|geometric series formula]], valid for <math>|x| < 1</math>:\n\n:<math>(1+x)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1+x} = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 - x^5 + \\cdots</math>\n\nMore generally, with ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''s'':\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{(1-x)^s} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {s+k-1 \\choose k} x^k \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {s+k-1 \\choose s-1} x^k.</math>\n\nSo, for instance, when <math>s=1/2</math>,\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+x}} = \\textstyle 1 -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{8}x^2 - \\frac{5}{16}x^3 + \\frac{35}{128}x^4 - \\frac{63}{256}x^5 + \\cdots</math>\n\n=== Further generalizations ===\nThe generalized binomial theorem can be extended to the case where ''x'' and ''y'' are complex numbers. For this version, one should again assume |''x''|&nbsp;>&nbsp;|''y''|<ref name=convergence group=Note /> and define the powers of ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'' and ''x'' using a [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] [[complex logarithm|branch of log]] defined on an open disk of radius |''x''| centered at ''x''.\nThe generalized binomial theorem is valid also for elements ''x'' and ''y'' of a [[Banach algebra]] as long as ''xy''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''yx'', ''x''&nbsp;is invertible, and&nbsp;||''y/x''||&nbsp;<&nbsp;1.\n\nA version of the binomial theorem is valid for the following [[Pochhammer symbol]]-like family of polynomials: for a given real constant ''c'', define <math> x^{(0)} = 1 </math> and <math> x^{(n)} = \\prod_{k=1}^{n}[x+(k-1)c]</math> for <math> n > 0</math>.

By the binomial theorem this is equal to\n\n:<math> (x_{1}+y_{1})^{n_{1}}\\dotsm(x_{d}+y_{d})^{n_{d}} = \\sum_{k_{1}=0}^{n_{1}}\\dotsm\\sum_{k_{d}=0}^{n_{d}} \\binom{n_{1}}{k_{1}}\\, x_{1}^{k_{1}}y_{1}^{n_{1}-k_{1}}\\;\\dotsc\\;\\binom{n_{d}}{k_{d}}\\, x_{d}^{k_{d}}y_{d}^{n_{d}-k_{d}}. </math>\n\nThis may be written more concisely, by [[multi-index notation]], as\n\n:<math> (x+y)^\\alpha = \\sum_{\\nu \\le \\alpha} \\binom{\\alpha}{\\nu} x^\\nu y^{\\alpha - \\nu}.</math>\n\n=== General Leibniz rule ===\n{{Main|General Leibniz rule}}\n\nThe general Leibniz rule gives the {{mvar|n}}th derivative of a product of two functions in a form similar to that of the binomial theorem:<ref>{{cite book |last=Seely |first=Robert T. |title=Calculus of One and Several Variables |location=Glenview |publisher=Scott, Foresman |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-673-07779-0 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>(fg)^{(n)}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f^{(n-k)}(x) g^{(k)}(x).</math>\n\nHere, the superscript {{math|(''n'')}} indicates the {{mvar|n}}th derivative of a function.  If one sets {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''e''{{sup|''ax''}}}} and {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = ''e''{{sup|''bx''}}}}, and then cancels the common factor of {{math|''e''{{sup|(''a'' + ''b'')''x''}}}} from both sides of the result, the ordinary binomial theorem is recovered.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Multiple-angle identities ===\nFor the [[complex numbers]] the binomial theorem can be combined with [[De Moivre's formula]] to yield [[List of trigonometric identities#Multiple-angle formulae|multiple-angle formulas]] for the [[sine]] and [[cosine]]. According to De Moivre's formula,\n:<math>\\cos\\left(nx\\right)+i\\sin\\left(nx\\right) = \\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^n.</math>\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expression on the right can be expanded, and then the real and imaginary parts can be taken to yield formulas for cos(''nx'') and sin(''nx''). For example, since\n:<math>\\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^2 = \\cos^2 x + 2i \\cos x \\sin x - \\sin^2 x,</math>\nDe Moivre's formula tells us that\n:<math>\\cos(2x) = \\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\sin(2x) = 2 \\cos x \\sin x,</math>\nwhich are the usual double-angle identities. Similarly, since\n:<math>\\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^3 = \\cos^3 x + 3i \\cos^2 x \\sin x - 3 \\cos x \\sin^2 x - i \\sin^3 x,</math>\nDe Moivre's formula yields\n:<math>\\cos(3x) = \\cos^3 x - 3 \\cos x \\sin^2 x \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\sin(3x) = 3\\cos^2 x \\sin x - \\sin^3 x.</math>\nIn general,\n:<math>\\cos(nx) = \\sum_{k\\text{ even}} (-1)^{k/2} {n \\choose k}\\cos^{n-k} x \\sin^k x</math>\nand\n:<math>\\sin(nx) = \\sum_{k\\text{ odd}} (-1)^{(k-1)/2} {n \\choose k}\\cos^{n-k} x \\sin^k x.</math>\n\n=== Series for e ===\nThe [[e (mathematical constant)|number ''e'']] is often defined by the formula\n\n:<math>e = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n.</math>\n\nApplying the binomial theorem to this expression yields the usual [[infinite series]] for ''e''. In particular:\n\n:<math>\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n = 1 + {n \\choose 1}\\frac{1}{n} + {n \\choose 2}\\frac{1}{n^2} + {n \\choose 3}\\frac{1}{n^3} + \\cdots + {n \\choose n}\\frac{1}{n^n}.</math>\n\nThe ''k''th term of this sum is\n\n:<math>{n \\choose k}\\frac{1}{n^k} = \\frac{1}{k!}\\cdot\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots (n-k+1)}{n^k}</math>\n\nAs ''n''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e, the rational expression on the right approaches one, and therefore\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} {n \\choose k}\\frac{1}{n^k} = \\frac{1}{k!}.</math>\n\nThis indicates that ''e'' can be written as a series:\n\n:<math>e=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k!}=\\frac{1}{0!} + \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} + \\frac{1}{3!} + \\cdots.</math>\n\nIndeed, since each term of the binomial expansion is an [[Monotonic function|increasing function]] of ''n'', it follows from the [[monotone convergence theorem]] for series that the sum of this infinite series is equal to&nbsp;''e''.\n\n=== Probability ===\nThe binomial theorem is closely related to the probability mass function of the [[negative binomial distribution]]. The probability of a (countable) collection of independent Bernoulli trials <math>\\{X_t\\}_{t\\in S}</math> with probability of success <math>p\\in [0,1]</math> all not happening is  <math display=\"block\"> P\\left(\\bigcap_{t\\in S} X_t^C\\right) = (1-p)^{|S|} = \\sum_{n=0}^{|S|} {|S| \\choose n} (-p)^n</math>A useful upper bound for this quantity is <math> e^{-pn}</math>. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Compression|last=Cover|first=Thomas M.|last2=Thomas|first2=Joy A.|date=2001-01-01|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780471200611|pages=320|language=en|doi=10.1002/0471200611.ch5}}</ref>\n\n== The binomial theorem in abstract algebra ==\n\nFormula (1) is valid more generally for any elements ''x'' and ''y'' of a [[semiring]] satisfying ''xy''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''yx''. The [[theorem]] is true even more generally: [[alternativity]] suffices in place of [[associativity]].\n\nThe binomial theorem can be stated by saying that the [[polynomial sequence]] {&nbsp;1,&nbsp;''x'',&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>,&nbsp;''x''<sup>3</sup>,&nbsp;...&nbsp;} is of [[binomial type]].\n\n== In popular culture ==\n* The binomial theorem is mentioned in the [[Major-General's Song]] in the comic opera [[The Pirates of Penzance]].\n* [[Professor Moriarty]] is described by Sherlock Holmes as having written [[A Treatise on the Binomial Theorem|a treatise on the binomial theorem]].\n* The Portuguese poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], using the heteronym [[\u00c1lvaro de Campos]], wrote that \"Newton's Binomial is as beautiful as the [[Venus de Milo]].

The employers would give each servant a box to take home containing gifts, bonuses, and sometimes leftover food.\n\nIn South Africa (a former British [[commonwealth realm]]) as recently as the 1980s, milkmen and garbage collectors, who normally had little if any interaction with those they served, were accustomed to knock on their doors asking for a \"Christmas box\", being a small cash donation, in the week or so before and after Christmas.\n\nThe European tradition, which has long included giving money and other gifts to those who were needy and in service positions, has been dated to the [[Middle Ages]], but the exact origin is unknown. It is believed to be in reference to the Alms Box placed in areas of worship to collect donations to the poor.

For many merchants, Boxing Day has become the day of the year with the greatest revenue. In the UK in 2009 it was estimated that up to 12 million shoppers appeared at the sales (a rise of almost 20% compared to 2008, although this was also affected by the fact that the [[VAT]] was about to revert to 17.5% from 1 January, following the temporary reduction to 15%).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8432144.stm |title=Boxing Day sales attract 'record' number of shoppers |publisher=BBC News |date=28 December 2009 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nMany retailers open very early (typically 5&nbsp;am or even earlier) and offer [[doorbuster]] deals and [[loss leader]]s to draw people to their stores. It is not uncommon for long queues to form early in the morning of 26 December, hours before the opening of shops holding the big sales, especially at [[Big-box store|big-box consumer electronics]] retailers.<ref name=\"ctv.ca\" /> Many stores have a limited quantity of big draw or deeply discounted items.<ref name=\"toronto.ctv.ca\">{{cite web |url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071213/boxing_day_071213?hub=EdmontonHome |title = How to become a Boxing Day shopping pro |date = 25 December 2007 |author = Ashleigh Patterson |accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> Because of the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, many choose to stay at home and avoid the hectic shopping experience.

They may limit entrances, restrict the number of patrons in a store at a time, provide tickets to people at the head of the queue to guarantee them a hot ticket item or canvass queued-up shoppers to inform them of inventory limitations.<ref name=\"toronto.ctv.ca\" />\n\nIn recent years, retailers have expanded deals to \"[[Boxing Week]]\". While Boxing Day is 26 December, many retailers will run the sales for several days before or after 26 December, often up to New Year's Eve. Notably, in [[Late 2000s recession|the recession of late 2008]], a record number of retailers were holding early promotions due to a weak economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20081221/Shopping_Deals_081222/ |title=Boxing Day comes early as shoppers search for deals |author=CTV.ca News Staff |date=21 December 2008 |accessdate=17 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106141332/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20081221/Shopping_Deals_081222/ |archivedate=6 January 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> Canada's Boxing Day has often been compared with the American [[Super Saturday]] (the Saturday before Christmas) and [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]. From 2009 onward Black Friday deals become more prominent among Canadian retailers to discourage shoppers from crossing the border to the US when the Canadian and USA dollars was close to parity, and this has lessened the appeal of Boxing Day in Canada somewhat as it was overtaken by Black Friday in terms of sales in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/inside-the-shopping-extravaganza-that-black-friday-has-become-in-canada|title=Inside the shopping extravaganza that Black Friday has become in Canada|publisher=}}</ref> Boxing Day is not and has never been a shopping holiday in the USA; however, 26 December often starts many retailers' after-Christmas sales.\n\nIn some areas of Canada, particularly in [[Atlantic Canada]] and parts of [[Northern Ontario]], most retailers are prohibited from opening on Boxing Day, either by provincial law or by municipal [[bylaw]], or instead by informal agreement among major retailers to provide a day of relaxation following Christmas Day. In these areas, sales otherwise scheduled for 26 December are moved to the 27th.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geschenkhexe.ch/media/archive/Boxing-Day-The-Debate-Continues.html |title=Boxing Day, The Debate Continues |author=soonews.ca |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hAtdtyDSIeYttaUmCcZLT_bGhGzg |title=Boxing Day madness: shoppers descend on stores looking for deals |author=The Canadian Press |date=26 December 2009 |accessdate=26 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> The city council of [[Greater Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], which was the largest city in Canada to maintain this restriction as of the early 2010s, formally repealed its store hours bylaw on 9 December 2014.<ref>[http://www.thesudburystar.com/2014/12/09/council-repeals-sudburys-store-hours-byline \"Council repeals Sudbury's store hours bylaw\"].

Since the transition to a summer season in the 1990s, no formal fixtures are now arranged on Boxing Day but some clubs, such as [[Wakefield Trinity]], arrange a traditional [[local derby]] friendly fixture instead.\n\nIn Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, [[Test cricket]] matches are played on Boxing Day.

However, the 2013 collective bargaining agreement (which followed [[2012-13 NHL lockout|a lock-out]]) extended the league mandate of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day off to include Boxing Day, except when it falls on a Saturday, in which case the league can choose to make 23 December a league-wide off day instead for that year.<ref name=\"NHL CBA\">{{cite web|title=National Hockey League CBA|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/CBA2012/NHL_NHLPA_2013_CBA.pdf |page=101\u2014not digital page 101 but the printed 101 |publisher=[[National Hockey League]] |accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn some African [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, particularly Ghana, Uganda, Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania, [[professional boxing]] contests are held on Boxing Day.

It is Pakistan's largest province by area, constituting 44% of Pakistan's total land mass. The province is bordered by [[Afghanistan]] to the north and north-west, Iran to the south-west, [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]], and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] to the north-east. To the south lies the [[Arabian Sea]]. Balochistan is located on the south-eastern part of the Iranian plateau. It borders the geopolitical regions of the Middle East and Southwest Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. Balochistan lies at the mouth of the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and provides the shortest route from seaports to Central Asia. Its geographical location has placed the otherwise desolate region in the scope of competing global interests for all of recorded history.\n\nThe capital city Quetta is located in a densely populated portion of the [[Sulaiman Mountains]] in the north-east of the province. It is situated in a river valley near the Bolan Pass, which has been used as the route of choice from the coast to Central Asia, entering through Afghanistan's [[Kandahar]] region. The British and other historic empires have crossed the region to invade Afghanistan by this route.<ref>Bolan Pass \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition</ref>\n\nBalochistan is rich in exhaustible and renewable resources; it is the second major supplier of natural gas in Pakistan. The province's renewable and human resource potential has not been systematically measured or exploited due to pressures from within and without Pakistan. Local inhabitants have chosen to live in towns and have relied on sustainable water sources for thousands of years.\n\n{| class=\"infobox borderless\"\n|+ Provincial symbols of Balochistan (unofficial)\n|-\n!

Tweed was a member of Palestine Lodge #204, New York City, Grand Lodge of Masons New York State.</ref> and joined a volunteer fire company, Engine No. 12.<ref name=encnyc /> In 1848, at the invitation of state assemblyman John J. Reilly, he and some friends organized the Americus Fire Company No. 6, also known as the \"Big Six\", as a [[volunteer fireman|volunteer fire company]], which took as its symbol a snarling red [[Bengal tiger]], a symbol which remained associated with Tweed and [[Tammany Hall]] for many years.<ref name= encnyc />  At the time, volunteer fire companies competed vigorously with each other; some were connected with street gangs and had strong ethnic ties to various immigrant communities.  The competition could be so fierce that buildings would sometimes burn down while the fire companies fought each other.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.654, 724, 823</ref> Tweed became known for his ax-wielding violence, and was soon elected the Big Six foreman. Pressure from Alfred Carlson, the chief engineer, got him thrown out of the crew, but fire companies were also recruiting grounds for political parties at the time, and Tweed's exploits came to the attention of the Democratic politicians who ran the Seventh Ward, who put him up for Alderman in 1850, when Tweed was 26.  He lost that election to the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[Morgan Morgans]], but ran again the next year and won, garnering his first political position.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.823</ref>\n\nTweed was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1852, but his two-year term was undistinguished.<ref name=gotham837>Burrows & Wallace, p.837</ref>  In an attempt by Republican reformers in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], the state capital, to control the Democratic-dominated New York City government, the power of the New York County Board of Supervisors was beefed up. The board had 12 members, six appointed by the mayor and six elected, and in 1858 Tweed was appointed to the board, which became his first vehicle for large-scale [[Graft (politics)|graft]]; Tweed and other supervisors forced vendors to pay a 15% overcharge to their \"ring\" in order to do business with the city.<ref name=gotham837 />  By 1853, Tweed was running the seventh ward for Tammany.<ref name=encnyc />\n\nAlthough he was not trained as a lawyer, Tweed's friend, Judge [[George G. Barnard]], certified him as an attorney, and Tweed opened a law office on Duane Street.  He ran for [[New York City Sheriff's Office|sheriff]] in 1861 and was defeated, but became the chairman of the Democratic General Committee shortly after the election, and was then chosen to be the head of Tammany's general committee in January 1863.  Several months later, in April, he became \"Grand Sachem\", and began to be referred to as \"Boss\", especially after he tightened his hold on power by creating a small executive committee to run the club.<ref name=encnyc /> Tweed then took steps to increase his income: he used his law firm to extort money, which was then disguised as legal services; he had himself appointed deputy street commissioner&nbsp;\u2013 a position with considerable access to city contractors and funding; he bought the New-York Printing Company, which became the city's official printer, and the city's stationery supplier, the Manufacturing Stationers' Company, and had both companies begin to overcharge for their goods and services.<ref name=encnyc /> He also started to form what became known as the \"Tweed Ring\", by having his friends elected to office: George G. Barnard was elected [[Recorder of New York City]]; [[Peter B. Sweeny]] was elected [[New York County District Attorney]]; and [[Richard B. Connolly]] was elected City Comptroller.<ref name=gotham837 />\n\n[[File:Nast-Boss-Tweed-1871.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Thomas Nast]] depicts Tweed in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' (October 21, 1871)]]\n\nWith his new position and wealth came a change in style: Tweed began to favor wearing a large diamond in his shirtfront&nbsp;\u2013 a habit that [[Thomas Nast]] used to great effect in his attacks on Tweed in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' beginning in 1869&nbsp;\u2013 and he bought a [[brownstone]] to live in at 41 West 36th Street, then a very fashionable area.  He invested his now considerable illegal income in real estate, so that by the late 1860s he ranked among the biggest landowners in New York City.<ref name=encnyc />\n\nTweed was a member of the [[New York State Senate]] (4th D.) from 1868 to 1873, sitting in the [[91st New York State Legislature|91st]], [[92nd New York State Legislature|92nd]], [[93rd New York State Legislature|93rd]] and [[94th New York State Legislature]]s, but not taking his seat in the [[95th New York State Legislature|95th]] and [[96th New York State Legislature]]s. In the Senate he helped financiers [[Jay Gould]] and [[Big Jim Fisk]] to take control of the [[Erie Railroad]] from [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] by arranging for legislation that legitimized fake Erie stock certificates that Gould and Fisk had issued. In return, Tweed received a large block of stock and was made a director of the company.<ref name=encnyc />\n\n==Corruption==\nAfter the election of 1869, Tweed took control of the New York City government.  His prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[John T. Hoffman]], the former mayor of the city, won election as governor, and Tweed garnered the support of good government reformers like [[Peter Cooper]] and the [[Union League Club]], by proposing a new city charter which returned power to City Hall at the expense of the Republican-inspired state commissions. The new charter passed, thanks in part to $600,000 in bribes Tweed paid to Republicans, and was signed into law by Hoffman in 1870.  Mandated new elections allowed Tammany to take over the city's Common Council when they won all fifteen aldermanic contests.<ref name=gotham927>Burrows & Wallace, pp.927\u2013928</ref><ref name=History.com/>\n\nThe new charter put control of the city's finances in the hands of a Board of Audit, which consisted of Tweed, who was Commissioner of Public Works, Mayor [[A. Oakey Hall]] and Comptroller [[Richard B. Connolly|Richard \"Slippery Dick\" Connolly]], both Tammany men. Hall also appointed other Tweed associates to high offices&nbsp;\u2014 such as [[Peter B. Sweeny]], who took over the Department of Public Parks<ref name=gotham927 />&nbsp;\u2014 providing the Tweed Ring with even firmer control of the New York City government<ref>Paine, p. 140.</ref> and enabling them to defraud the taxpayers of many more millions of dollars. In the words of [[Albert Bigelow Paine]], \"their methods were curiously simple and primitive. There were no skilful manipulations of figures, making detection difficult ... Connolly, as Controller, had charge of the books, and declined to show them. With his fellows, he also 'controlled' the courts and most of the bar.\"<ref>Paine, p. 143.</ref> Contractors working for the city&nbsp;\u2013 \"Ring favorites, most of them&nbsp;\u2013 were told to multiply the amount of each bill by five, or ten, or a hundred, after which, with Mayor Hall's 'O.

They would buy up undeveloped property, then use the resources of the city to improve the area\u2014for instance by installing pipes to bring in water from the [[Croton Aqueduct]]\u2014thus increasing the value of the land, after which they sold and took their profits.  The focus on the east side also slowed down the development of the west side, the [[topography]] of which made it more expensive to improve.  The ring also took their usual percentage of padded contracts, as well as raking off money from property taxes. Despite the corruption of Tweed and Tammany Hall, they did accomplish the development of upper Manhattan, though at the cost of tripling the city's bond debt to almost $90 million.<ref name=gotham929>Burrows & Wallace, pp.929\u2013931</ref>\n\nDuring the Tweed era, the proposal to build a suspension bridge between New York and [[Brooklyn]], then an independent city, was floated by Brooklyn-boosters, who saw the ferry connections as a bottleneck to Brooklyn's further development.  In order to ensure that the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] project would go forward, State Senator [[Henry Cruse Murphy]] approached Tweed to find out whether New York's aldermen would approve the proposal. Tweed's response was that $60,000 for the aldermen would close the deal, and contractor [[William C. Kingsley]] put up the cash, which was delivered in a [[carpet bag]].  Tweed and two others from Tammany also received over half the private stock of the Bridge Company, the charter of which specified that only private stockholders had voting rights, so that even though the cities of Brooklyn and Manhattan put up most of the money, they essentially had no control over the project.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.934\u2013935</ref>\n\nTweed bought a mansion on [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[43rd Street (Manhattan)|43rd Street]], and stabled his horses, carriages and sleighs on [[40th Street (Manhattan)|40th Street]].  By 1871, he was a member of the board of directors of not only the Erie Railroad and the Brooklyn Bridge Company, but also the Third Avenue Railway Company and the Harlem Gas Light Company.  He was president of the Guardian Savings Banks and he and his confederates set up the Tenth National Bank to better control their fortunes.<ref name=encnyc />\n\n==Scandal==\nTweed's downfall came in the wake of the [[Orange riots|Orange riot of 1871]], which came after Tammany Hall banned a parade of Irish Protestants celebrating a historical victory against Catholicism, because of a riot the year before in which eight people died when a crowd of Irish Catholic laborers attacked the paraders.  Under strong pressure from the newspapers and the Protestant elite of the city, Tammany reversed course, and the march was allowed to proceed, with protection from [[NYPD|city policemen]] and [[New York State National Guard|state militia]].  The result was an even larger riot in which over 60 people were killed and more than 150 injured.<ref name=\"bw1003-1008\">Burrows & Wallace, pp.1003\u20131008</ref>\n\nAlthough Tammany's electoral power base was largely centered in the Irish immigrant population, it also needed the city's elite to acquiesce in its rule, and this was conditional on the machine's ability to control the actions of its people, but the July riot showed that this capability was not nearly as strong as had been supposed.<ref name=\"bw1003-1008\"/>\n\n[[File:Boss Tweed, Nast.jpg|thumb|right|237px|Nast shows Tweed's source of power: control of the ballot box. \"As long as I count the Votes, what are you going to do about it?\"]]\n\nTweed had for months been under attack from ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Thomas Nast]], the cartoonist from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''&nbsp;\u2013 regarding Nast's cartoons, Tweed reportedly said, \"Stop them damned pictures.

They were able to force an examination of the city's books, but the blue-ribbon commission of six businessmen appointed by Mayor [[A. Oakey Hall]], a Tammany man, which included [[John Jacob Astor III]], banker [[Moses Taylor]] and others who benefited from Tammany's actions, found that the books had been \"faithfully kept\", letting the air out of the effort to dethrone Tweed.<ref name=g1008>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1008\u20131011</ref>\n\nThe response to the Orange riot changed everything, and only days afterwards the ''Times''/Nast campaign began to garner popular support.<ref name=g1008 /> More important, the ''Times'' started to receive inside information from County Sheriff James O'Brien, whose support for Tweed had fluctuated during Tammany's reign. O'Brien had tried to [[blackmail]] Tammany by threatening to expose the ring's [[embezzlement]] to the press, and when this failed he provided the evidence he had collected to the ''Times''.<ref name=\"Ellis347-8\">Ellis, pp. 347\u2013348.</ref> Shortly afterward, county auditor Matthew J. O'Rourke supplied additional details to the ''Times'',<ref name=\"Ellis347-8\" /> which was reportedly offered $5 million to not publish the evidence.<ref>Paine, p. 170.</ref>  The ''Times'' also obtained the accounts of the recently deceased James Watson, who was the Tweed Ring's bookkeeper, and these were published daily, culminating in a special four-page supplement on July 29 headlined \"Gigantic Frauds of the Ring Exposed\".<ref name=g1008 /> In August, Tweed began to transfer ownership in his real-estate empire and other investments to his family members.<ref name=encnyc />\n\nThe expos\u00e9 provoked an international crisis of confidence in New York City's finances, and, in particular, in its ability to repay its debts.  European investors were heavily positioned in the city's bonds and were already nervous about its management \u2013 only the reputations of the underwriters were preventing a run on the city's securities.  New York's financial and business community knew that if the city's credit was to collapse, it could potentially bring down every bank in the city with it.<ref name=g1008 />\n\nThus, the city's elite met at [[Cooper Union]] in September to discuss political reform: but for the first time, the conversation included not only the usual reformers, but also [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] bigwigs such as [[Samuel J. Tilden]], who had been thrust aside by Tammany. The consensus was that the \"wisest and best citizens\" should take over the governance of the city and attempt to restore investor confidence. The result was the formation of the Executive Committee of Citizens and Taxpayers for Financial Reform of the City (also known as \"the [[Committee of Seventy (New York City)|Committee of Seventy]]\"), which attacked Tammany by cutting off the city's funding. Property owners refused to pay their municipal taxes, and a judge\u2014Tweed's old friend George Barnard, no less\u2014enjoined the city Comptroller from issuing bonds or spending money. Unpaid workers turned against Tweed, marching  to City Hall demanding to be paid.  Tweed doled out some funds from his own purse\u2014$50,000\u2014but it was not sufficient to end the crisis, and Tammany began to lose its essential base.<ref name=g1008 />\n\nShortly thereafter, the Comptroller resigned, appointing [[Andrew Haswell Green]], an associate of Tilden's, as his replacement. Green loosened the purse strings again, allowing city departments not under Tammany control to borrow money to operate. Green and Tilden had the city's records closely examined, and discovered money that went directly from city contractors into Tweed's pocket. The following day, they had Tweed arrested.<ref name=g1008 />\n\n==Imprisonment, escape, and death==\n[[File:Thomas Nast, Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make cph.3a00899.jpg|thumb|\"Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make\": Editorial cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] predicting Tweed could not be kept behind bars (''Harper's Weekly'', January 6, 1872)<ref>\n{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0106.html |title=On This Day: January 6, 1872 |website=The New York Times |publisher= |access-date=May 14, 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nTweed was released on $1 million bail, and Tammany set to work to recover its position through the ballot box.  Tweed was re-elected to the state senate in November 1871, due to his personal popularity and largesse in his district, but in general Tammany did not do well, and the members of the Tweed Ring began to flee the jurisdiction, many going overseas.

Ackerman]]:<blockquote>It's hard not to admire the skill behind Tweed's system ... The Tweed ring at its height was an engineering marvel, strong and solid, strategically deployed to control key power points: the courts, the legislature, the treasury and the ballot box. Its frauds had a grandeur of scale and an elegance of structure: money-laundering, profit sharing and organization.<ref>''Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York'' New York: [[Carroll & Graf]], 2005; quoted in [[Pete Hamill|Hammill, Pete]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/books/review/027HAMILL.html?_r=0 \"'Boss Tweed': The Fellowship of the Ring\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (March 27, 2005)</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn depictions of Tweed and the Tammany Hall organization, historians have emphasized the thievery and conspiratorial nature of Boss Tweed, along with lining his own pockets and those of his friends and allies. The theme is that the sins of corruption so violated American standards of political rectitude that they far overshadow Tweed's positive contributions to New York City.\n\nAlthough he held numerous important public offices and was one of a handful of senior leaders of Tammany Hall, as well as the state legislature and the state Democratic Party,<ref name=History.com/> Tweed was never the sole \"boss\" of New York City. He shared control of the city with numerous less famous people, such as the villains depicted in the Nast's famous circle of guilt cartoon shown above. Seymour J. Mandelbaum has argued that, apart from the corruption he engaged in, Tweed was a modernizer who prefigured certain elements of the [[Progressive Era]] in terms of more efficient city management.  Much of the money he siphoned off from the city treasury went to needy constituents who appreciated the free food at Christmas time and remembered it at the next election, and to precinct workers who provided the muscle of his machine.  As a legislator he worked to expand and strengthen welfare programs, especially those by private charities, schools, and hospitals.  With a base in the Irish Catholic community, he opposed efforts of Protestants to require the reading of the [[King James Bible]] in public schools, which was done deliberately to keep out Catholics.  He facilitated  the founding of the [[New York Public Library]], even though one of its founders, Samuel Tilden, was Tweed's sworn enemy in the Democratic Party.<ref>Mandelbaum, Seymour J. ''Boss Tweed's New York'' (1965)</ref><ref>Muccigrosso, Robert ed., ''Research Guide to American Historical Biography'' (1988) 1538\u201342</ref>\n\nTweed recognized that the support of his constituency was necessary for him to remain in power, and as a consequence he used the machinery of the city's government to provide numerous social services, including building more orphanages, almshouses and public baths.<ref name=encnyc /> Tweed also fought for the [[New York State Legislature]] to donate to private charities of all religious denominations, and subsidize [[Catholic schools]] and hospitals.  From 1869 to 1871, under Tweed's influence, the state of New York spent more on charities than for the entire time period from 1852 to 1868 combined.<ref>Ackerman, p. 66.</ref> Tweed also pushed through funding for a teachers college and prohibition of [[corporal punishment]] in schools, as well as salary increases for school teachers.\n\nDuring Tweed's regime, the main business thoroughfare Broadway was widened between [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] and [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]], land was secured for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[Upper East Side]] and [[Upper West Side]] were developed and provided the necessary infrastructure \u2013 all to the benefit of the purses of the Tweed Ring, but also, ultimately, to the benefit of the people of the city.\n\nAccording to [[Leo Hershkowitz]] in ''Tweed's New York: Another Look'', there is no evidence of any personal financial gain on Tweed's part, despite the implications of Thomas Nast in ''Harper's Weekly'' and the editors of ''The New York Times'', which both had ties to the  Republican party. In part, the campaign against Tweed diverted public attention from Republican scandals such as the [[Whiskey Ring]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hershkowitz|first=Leo|title=Tweed's New York: Another Look|date=1977|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY}}</ref>\n\nTweed himself wanted no particular recognition of his achievements, such as they were. When it was proposed, in March 1871, when he was at the height of his power, that a statue be erected in his honor, he declared: \"Statues are not erected to living men ... I claim to be a live man, and hope (Divine Providence permitting) to survive in all my vigor, politically and physically, some years to come.\"<ref name=encnyc /> One of Tweed's unwanted legacies is that he has become \"the archetype of the bloated, rapacious, corrupt city boss\".<ref name=encnyc />\n\n[[Image:Boss tweed.jpg|thumb|right|225px|An 1869 cigar box label featuring Tweed]]\n\n==Middle name==\nTweed never signed his name with anything other than a plain \"M.\", and his middle name is often mistakenly listed as \"Marcy\". His actual middle name was \"Magear\", his mother's maiden name; Tweed's son's name was William Magear Tweed, Jr.  The confusion derives from  a Nast cartoon with a picture of Tweed, supplemented with a quote from [[William L.

It has a diverse cultural mix of people and is the location of the [[Balti Triangle]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Balsallheath.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Balsall Heath, circa 1890.]]\n[[File:Balsall Heath Baths and Library.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Public Library and Baths, Balsall Heath|Balsall Heath Baths and Library]].]]\nBalsall Heath was agricultural land between [[Moseley]] village and the city of Birmingham until the 1850s when expansion along Moseley Road joined the two. The area was originally part of the [[Worcestershire]] parish of [[King's Norton]], and was added to the [[county borough]] of Birmingham in [[Warwickshire]] on 1 October 1891.\n\nDuring negotiations in the previous year it had been promised a public baths and a free library. In 1895, the library was opened on Moseley Road and, in 1907, [[Public Library and Baths, Balsall Heath|Balsall Heath Baths]] were opened in an adjoining building.  \n\nIn 1900, the city's [[College of Art, Balsall Heath|College of Art]] was also opened on Moseley Road. By this time the small lake (\"Lady Pool\" on old maps) at the end of Ladypool Road had been filled in to create a park. \n\nBalsall Heath initially had a reasonably affluent population, which can still be seen in the dilapidated grandeur of some of the larger houses. A railway station on Brighton Road (on the Birmingham to [[Bristol]] line) led to further expansion, and the end of the 19th century saw a proliferation of high-density small [[terraced house]]s.\n\nA [[Muslim]] community was started in June 1940 when two [[Yemen]]is purchased an artisan cottage on Mary Street. With the mosque being located in the area, more Muslim immigrants began to move into private lodgings in Balsall Heath.<ref>{{cite book|author=Abner Cohen|title=Urban Ethnicity|pages=96|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-32982-5}}</ref> Today, Balsall Heath has one of the largest Muslim communities in Birmingham. It is also home to diverse communities from across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].\n\nBy the 1980s, many of Balsall Heath's houses were in a dilapidated condition; some still lacked bathrooms or indoor toilets. The local council considered demolishing these properties but chose to refurbish them as part of an [[urban renewal]] scheme. Most of these Victorian terraces still exist and, along with more modern [[social housing]], characterise the area today. The area's traditional 'brick' pavements were replaced at this time by the more modern and conventional paving slabs.  \n\nBalsall Heath's low rents also attracted a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] student population. Its proximity to the [[University of Birmingham]], the city centre and the \"trendy\" area of [[Moseley]] were all contributing factors. There was little conflict between the students and locals despite their vastly differing lifestyles. However, a knife-incident in 1991 led to an article in ''[[Redbrick (Newspaper)|Redbrick]]'' warning students not to live in the area.\n\nIn July 2005, Balsall Heath was hit by a [[Birmingham Tornado (UK)|tornado]], which devastated many buildings around Church Road and Ladypool Road. Birmingham City Council offered loans to those who would otherwise be unable to repair their properties, and the area has now made a full recovery.\n\n===Red light era===\n[[Street prostitution]] first appeared in Balsall Heath during the 1950s. Property values fell, attracting Birmingham's poorer migrants. By the 1970s, the area was notorious for [[robbery|street robberies]] and [[drug dealing]]. Cheddar Road was the centre of a red-light district worked by 450 women. About half of the 50 houses on this road had prostitutes advertising themselves in the windows, similar to [[De Wallen|Amsterdam]]. It was labelled Britain's busiest cul-de-sac.<ref name=Sky>{{cite web |author=David Crabtree |title=Big Society Alive and Kicking in Inner City |url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/15929966 |work=Sky News |publisher= |date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, an organisation called ANAWIM was formed by the [[Sisters of Charity]] to provide outreach support to the prostitutes.<ref name=bh308>{{Cite news |title=ANAWIM Celebrates Silver Jubilee | newspaper=The Balsall Heathan | number= 308| date=November 2011| publisher=St. Paul's Community Trust}}</ref>  \n\nIn September 1992, a report was published encouraging the formation of a zone of tolerance towards prostitution in Balsall Heath. This was opposed by residents and a local police inspector. In the following year Samo Paull, a woman working as a prostitute, was abducted from Balsall Heath and murdered. \n\nIn 1994, residents began to organise street patrols forcing the prostitutes and street criminals out of the area. These patrols had the qualified support of the police but were regarded as [[vigilante]]s by some. There was an immediate two-thirds reduction in street and window prostitution.<ref name=Sky/> By November 1995, they had been almost completely eliminated.\n\nThe area has enjoyed a slow revival. House prices are now similar to those in other inner-city areas, while the crime rate is among the lowest.\n\n==Notable buildings==\n<!--alphabetical order please-->\n*[[Public Library and Baths, Balsall Heath|Moseley Road Baths]]\n*[[College of Art, Balsall Heath|Moseley School of Art]]\n*[[St Barnabas' Church, Balsall Heath|St Barnabas' Church]]\n*[[St Paul's Church, Balsall Heath|St Paul's Church]]\n\n==Notable residents==\n<!--PLEASE NOTE: alphabetical order by surname and no red links--->\n*[[Donnaleigh Bailey]], ''[[Michelle Corrigan]]'' in the [[Birmingham]]-based soap ''[[Doctors (soap opera)|Doctors]]''\n*Alderman [[John Bowen (alderman)|John Bowen]], JP\n*[[Percy Bullock]], Worcestershire cricketer\n*[[Howard R.

The company superseded the Bunge Company founded in [[Amsterdam]] by Johann Bunge, in 1818. Following the purchase of {{convert|60000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of prime [[pampas]] wheat fields, Bunge & Born established ''Centenera'', their first food processing plant, in 1899.

On April 26, the regiment surrounded Booth and one of his accomplices, [[David Herold]], in a tobacco barn on the [[Virginia]] farm of Richard Garrett. Herold surrendered, but Booth refused.

When questioned by Edwin Stanton about Booth's capture and shooting, both Doherty and Corbett agreed that Corbett had in fact disobeyed orders not to shoot. However, Corbett maintained that he believed Booth had intended to shoot his way out of the barn and that he acted in self-defense. He stated, \"...Booth would have killed me if I had not shot first.

Corbett told the crowd:\n\n<blockquote>I aimed at his body. I did not want to kill him....I think he stooped to pick up something just as I fired. That may probably account for his receiving the ball in the head. [W]hen the assassin lay at my feet, a wounded man, and I saw the [[bullet]] had taken effect about an inch back of the ear, and I remembered that Mr. Lincoln was wounded about the same part of the head, I said: \"What a God we have...God avenged Abraham Lincoln.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|pp=227\u2013228}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEyewitnesses to Booth's shooting contradicted Corbett's version of events and expressed doubts that Corbett was responsible for shooting Booth. Officers who were near Corbett at the time claimed that they never saw him fire his gun (Corbett's gun was never inspected and was eventually lost). They claimed that Corbett came forward only after Lt. Colonel Conger asked who had shot Booth. Richard Garrett, the owner of the farm on which Booth was captured, and his 12-year-old son Robert also contradicted Corbett's testimony that he acted in self-defense. Both maintained that Booth had never reached for his gun.<ref>{{harvnb|Nottingham|1997|p=148}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was some criticism of Corbett's actions, he was largely considered a hero by the public and press.

Large Berber-speaking migrant communities, today numbering about 4 million, have been living in Western Europe, spanning over three generations, since the 1950s. The number of Berber people is much higher than the number of Berber speakers. The bulk of the populations of the [[Maghreb]] countries are considered to have Berber ancestors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3509799.stm|title=BBC NEWS.

The extinct [[Guanche language]] spoken on the [[Canary Islands]] by the [[Guanches]] as well as the languages of the ancient [[C-Group culture]] in present-day southern Egypt and northern [[Sudan]] are believed to have belonged to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family.\n\nThe Berber languages and dialects have had a written tradition, on and off, for about 2,500 years, although the tradition has been frequently disrupted by cultural shifts and invasions. They were first written in the Libyco-Berber [[abjad]], which is still used today by the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] in the form of Tifinagh. The oldest dated inscription is from 3rd century BCE. Later, between about 1000 CE and 1500 CE, they were written in the [[Arabic script]], and since the 20th century they have been written in the [[Berber Latin alphabet]], especially among the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] and [[Riffian people|Riffian]] communities of Morocco and Algeria. The Berber Latin alphabet was also used by most European and Berber linguists during the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/la-langue-berbere.html|title=Centre de Recherche Berb\u00e8re - La Langue Berb\u00e8re|website=www.centrederechercheberbere.fr}}</ref>\n\nA modernised form of the Tifinagh alphabet, called [[Neo-Tifinagh]], was adopted in Morocco in 2003 for writing Berber, but many Moroccan Berber publications still use the Berber Latin alphabet. Algerians mostly use the Berber Latin alphabet in Berber-language education at public schools, while Tifinagh is mostly used for artistic symbolism. Mali and Niger recognise a Tuareg Berber Latin alphabet customised to the Tuareg phonological system. However, traditional Tifinagh is still used in those countries.\n\nThere is a cultural and political movement among speakers of the closely related varieties of Northern Berber to promote and unify them under a written [[standard language]] called ''Tamazi\u0263t'' (or ''Tamazight''). The name ''Tamazi\u0263t'' is the current native name of the Berber language in the Moroccan [[Middle Atlas]] and [[Rif]] regions and the Libyan [[Zuwarah]] region. In other Berber-speaking areas, this name was lost. There is historical evidence from medieval Berber manuscripts that all indigenous North Africans from Libya to Morocco have at some point called their language ''Tamazi\u0263t''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1268712/Some_grammatical_features_of_Ancient_Eastern_Berber_the_language_of_the_Mudawwana_|title=Some grammatical features of Ancient Eastern Berber (the language of the Mudawwana)|first=Vermondo|last=Brugnatelli|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemorocco.com/tamkardit-library/Grammatical_features_of_Eastern_Berber.pdf |format=PDF|title=Some grammatical features of ancient Eastern Berber |first= Vermondo |last=Brugnatelli|year= 2011|website=www.freemorocco.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Muhammad_Awzal_and_the_Berber_Literary_T.html?id=tsn7jwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Muhammad Awzal and the Berber Literary Tradition of the Sous|first=Nico Van den|last=Boogert|date=22 August 1995|publisher=|via=Google Books}}</ref> The name ''Tamazi\u0263t'' is currently being used increasingly by educated Berbers to refer to the written Berber language, and even to Berber as a whole, including Tuareg.\n\nIn 2001, Berber became a constitutional [[national language]] of Algeria, and in 2011 Berber became a constitutionally [[official language]] of Morocco.

It was borrowed from [[Latin]] ''Barbari''. The Latin word is also found in the Arabic designation for these populations, \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0628\u0631 (''al-Barbar''); see [[Names of the Berber people]].\n\nEtymologically, the Berber root ''M-Z-\u0194'' (''Mazigh'') (singular noun: ''Amazigh'', feminine: ''Tamazight'') means \"free man\", \"noble man\", or \"defender\". The feminine ''Tamazight'' traditionally referred specifically to the [[Riffian language|Riffian]] and [[Central Atlas Tamazight]] languages. Many Berber linguists prefer to consider the term ''Tamazight'' as a pure Berber word to be used only in Berber text while using the European word \"Berber/''Berbero''/''Berb\u00e8re''\" in European texts to follow the traditions of European writings about the Berbers. European languages distinguish between the words \"Berber\" and \"[[Barbarian#Berber and North African cultures|barbarian]]\", while Arabic has the same word ''al-Barbari'' for both meanings.\n\nSome other Berber writers, especially in Morocco, prefer to refer to Berber with ''Amazigh'' when writing about it in French or English.\n\nTraditionally, the term ''Tamazight'' (in various forms: ''Thamazighth'', ''Tamasheq'', ''Tamajaq'', ''Tamahaq'') was used by many Berber groups to refer to the language they spoke, including the [[Central Atlas Tamazight|Middle Atlas]], the [[Riffian people|Riffians]], the [[Sened language|Sened]] in Tunisia and the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]. However, other terms were used by other groups; for instance, some Berber populations of Algeria called their language ''Taznatit'' ([[Zenata|Zenati]]) or ''Shelha'', while the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]]s called theirs ''Taqbaylit'', and the inhabitants of the [[Siwa Oasis]] called their language ''Siwi''. In Tunisia, the local Amazigh language is usually referred to as ''Shelha'', a term which has been observed in Morocco as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rosettaproject.org/live/search/showpages?ethnocode%3DZEN%26doctype%3Ddetail%26version%3D0%26scale%3Dsix |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 28, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927144458/http://www.rosettaproject.org/live/search/showpages?ethnocode=ZEN&doctype=detail&version=0&scale=six |archivedate=September 27, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOne group, the [[Linguasphere Observatory]], has attempted to introduce the [[neologism]] \"Tamazic languages\" to refer to the Berber languages.<ref>[http://www.linguasphere.info/lcontao/tl_files/pdf/master/OL-SITE%201999-2000%20MASTER%20ONE%20Sectors%201-Intro.pdf  ''Afro-Asian Phylosector''] linguasphere.info.</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n{{main article|Proto-Berber language}}\nBerber is a branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Christopher Ehret; Bernd Heine, Derek Nurse (ed.)|title=African Languages: An Introduction|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521666295|page=290|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=C7XhcYoFxaQC&pg=PA290|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref> Since modern Berber languages are relatively homogeneous, the date of the [[Proto-Berber language]] from which the modern group is derived was probably comparatively recent, comparable to the age of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] or [[Romance languages|Romance]] subfamilies.

Hence, although Berber had split off from Afroasiatic several thousand years ago, Proto-Berber itself can only be reconstructed to a period as late as 200 A.D. Blench (2018) notes that Berber is considerably different from other Afroasiatic branches, but modern-day Berber languages display low internal diversity. The presence of [[Punic language|Punic]] borrowings in Proto-Berber points to the diversification of modern Berber language varieties subsequent to the fall of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] in 146 B.C.; only [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] lacks Punic loanwords.<ref name=\"Blench2018\"/> Additionally, [[Latin language|Latin]] loanwords in Proto-Berber point to the breakup of Proto-Berber between 0-200 A.D. During this time period, Roman innovations including the ox-plough, camel, and orchard management were adopted by Berber communities along the ''[[limes]]'', or borders of the Roman Empire. This resulted in a new trading culture involving the use of a [[lingua franca]] which became Proto-Berber.<ref name=\"Blench2018\"/>\n\n==Orthography==\n{{Main article|Berber orthography}}\n[[File:Prehistory-draa16.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Tifinagh|Libyco-Berber]] inscriptions in [[Zagora, Morocco|Zagora]], Morocco]]\nVarious orthographies have been used to transcribe the Berber languages.

Morocco is a country with several competing linguistically different languages, including French, [[Modern Standard Arabic]], [[Moroccan Darija|Moroccan Arabic]] and Amazigh.

Moreover, linguistic boundaries are blurred, such that certain languages cannot accurately be described as either Central Morocco Tamazight (spoken in the central and eastern [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] area) or Shilha.\n* '''Algeria''': In 1906, the total population speaking Berber languages in Algeria (excluding the thinly populated Sahara region) was estimated at 1,305,730 out of 4,447,149, i.e. 29 percent. [[File:Aires linguistiques du nord-est alg\u00e9rien.svg|180px|thumb| [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] and [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]] languages in the central-eastern part of Algeria]](Doutt\u00e9 & Gautier, ''Enqu\u00eate sur la dispersion de la langue berb\u00e8re en Alg\u00e9rie, faite par l'ordre de M. le Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral'', Alger 1913.) The 1911 census, however, found 1,084,702 speakers out of 4,740,526, i.e. 23 percent; Doutt\u00e9 & Gautier suggest that this was the result of a serious undercounting of [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]] in areas of widespread [[bilingualism]]. A trend was noted for Berber groups surrounded by Arabic (as in the city of [[Blida]]) to adopt Arabic, while Arabic speakers surrounded by Berber (as in Sikh ou Meddour near the city of [[Tizi Ouzou]]) tended to adopt Berber. In 1952, Andr\u00e9 Basset estimated that about a third of Algeria's population spoke Berber. According to historian Charles-Robert Ageron in 1886, Algeria had around 1.2 million Berber speakers and 1.1 million Arab speakers. The Algerian census of 1966 found 2,297,997 out of 12,096,347 Algerians, or 19 percent, to speak \"Berber\". In 1980, Salem Chaker estimated that \"in Algeria, 3,650,000, or one out of five Algerians, speak a Berber language\" (Chaker 1984, pp.&nbsp;8\u20139).

The Tuareg of the [[Sahel]] adds another million or so to the total.\n\n==Grammar==\n[[File:Qanun At Ali u Herzun.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Kabylian]] manuscript from the 18th century]]\n\n===Nouns===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n[[Noun]]s in the Berber languages vary in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine versus feminine), [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular versus plural) and [[Grammatical state|state]] (free state versus [[construct state]]). In the case of the masculine, nouns generally begin with one of the three vowels of Berber, ''a'', ''u'' or ''i'' (in standardised orthography, ''e'' represents a [[schwa]] {{IPA|[\u0259]}} inserted for reasons of pronunciation):\n::afus \"hand\"\n::argaz \"man\"\n::udem \"face\"\n::ul \"heart\"\n::ixef \"head\"\n::iles \"tongue\"\n\nWhile the masculine is unmarked, the feminine (also used to form [[diminutive]]s and [[singulative]]s, like an ear of wheat) is marked with the [[circumfix]] ''t...t''. Feminine plural takes a prefix ''t...'':\n::afus \u2192 tafust\n::udem \u2192 tudemt\n::ixef \u2192 tixeft\n::ifassen \u2192 tifassin\n\nBerber languages have two types of [[Grammatical number|number]]: singular and [[plural]], of which only the latter is marked. Plural has three forms according to the type of nouns. The first, \"regular\" type is known as the \"external plural\"; it consists in changing the initial vowel of the noun, and adding a [[suffix]] ''-n'':\n::afus \u2192 ifassen \"hands\"\n::argaz \u2192 irgazen \"men\"\n::ixef \u2192 ixfawen \"heads\"\n::ul \u2192 ulawen \"hearts\"\nThe second form of the plural is known as the \"broken plural\". It involves only a change in the vowels of the word:\n::adrar \u2192 idurar \"mountain\"\n::agadir \u2192 igudar \"wall / castle\"\n::abaghus \u2192 ibughas \"monkey\"\nThe third type of plural is a mixed form: it combines a change of vowels with the suffix ''-n'':<!--Sorry I can't see the difference with the first type! -->\n::izi \u2192 izan \"(the) fly\"\n::azur \u2192 izuran \"roof\"\n::iziker \u2192 izakaren \"rope\"\n\nBerber languages also have two types of states or [[grammatical case|cases]] of the [[noun]], organized [[Ergative case|ergatively]]: one is unmarked, while the other serves for the subject of a transitive verb and the object of a preposition, among other contexts. The former is often called ''free state'', the latter ''construct state''. The construct state of the noun derives from the free state through one of the following rules:\nThe first involves a vowel alternation, whereby the vowel ''a'' becomes ''u'':\n::argaz \u2192 urgaz\n::amghar \u2192 umghar\n::adrar \u2192 udrar\nThe second involves the loss of the initial vowel, in the case of some feminine nouns:\n::tamghart \u2192 temghart \"woman / mature woman\"\n::tamdint \u2192 temdint \"town\"\n::tarbat \u2192 terbat \"girl\"\nThe third involves the addition of a semi-vowel (''w'' or ''y'') word-initially:\n::asif \u2192 '''w'''asif \"river\"\n::a\u1e0du \u2192 '''w'''a\u1e0du \"wind\"\n::iles \u2192 '''y'''iles \"tongue\"\n::uccen \u2192 '''w'''uccen \"wolf\"\nFinally, some nouns do not change for free state:\n::taddart \u2192 taddart \"house / village\"\n::tuccent \u2192 tuccent \"female wolf\"\n\nThe following table gives the forms for the noun ''amghar'' \"old man / leader\":\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" | masculine\n| colspan=\"2\" | feminine\n|-\n| || default || agent || default || agent\n|-\n| singular || ''amghar'' || ''umghar'' || ''tamghart'' || ''temghart''\n|-\n| plural || ''imgharen'' || ''yimgharen'' || ''timgharin'' || ''temgharin''\n|}\n\n===Pronouns===\nBerber pronouns show gender distinction in the second- and third-persons, but in verbal agreement markers, the distinction is lost in the second-person.<ref>Bhat, D.N.S. 2004.

The primary difficulty of subclassification, however, lies in the eastern Berber languages, where there is little agreement. Otherwise there is consensus on the outlines of the family:\n* [[Eastern Berber languages|Eastern Berber]] (scope debated)\n* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]]\n** [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] (incl. Riffian and Shawiya)\n** [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]\n** [[Atlas languages|Atlas]] (incl. Shilha and Central Atlas Tamazight)\n* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]\n* [[Western Berber languages|Western Berber]] ([[Zenaga language|Zenaga]])\n\nThe various classifications differ primarily in what they consider to be Eastern Berber, and in how many varieties they recognise as distinct languages.\n\nThere is so little data available on [[Guanche language|Guanche]] that any classification is necessarily uncertain; however, it is almost universally acknowledged as Afro-Asiatic on the basis of the surviving glosses, and widely suspected to be Berber. Much the same can be said of the language, sometimes called \"[[Numidian language|Numidian]]\", used in the Libyan or Libyco-Berber inscriptions around the turn of the Common Era, whose alphabet is the ancestor of [[Tifinagh]].\n\n===Kossmann (1999)===\n[[Maarten Kossmann]] (1999) describes Berber as two [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]],\n* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] and\n* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]\nplus a few peripheral languages, spoken in isolated pockets largely surrounded by Arabic, that fall outside these continua, namely\n* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] and\n* [[Eastern Berber languages|the Libyan and Egyptian varieties]].\nWithin Northern Berber, however, he recognises a break in the continuum between [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] and their non-Zenati neighbours; and in the east, he recognises a division between [[Ghadam\u00e8s language|Ghadam\u00e8s]] and [[Awjila language|Awjila]] on the one hand and [[Sokna language|Sokna]] ([[Fuqaha, Libya]]), [[Siwa language|Siwa]] and [[Nafusi language|Djebel Nefusa]] on the other.

Their influence is also seen in some languages in West Africa. F. W. H. Migeod pointed to strong resemblances between Berber and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] in such words and phrases as these: Berber: '''obanis'''; Hausa ''obansa'' (his father); Berber: '''a bat'''; Hausa ''ya bata'' (he was lost); Berber: '''eghare'''; Hausa ''ya kirra'' (he called). In addition he notes that the genitive in both languages is formed with '''n''' = \"of\".<ref>Migeod, F. W. H., ''The Languages of West Africa''.

According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence suggests that the peoples of the [[C-Group culture]] in present-day southern [[Egypt]] and northern [[Sudan]] spoke Berber languages.<ref name=\"Bechaus-Gerst\"/><ref name=\"Lbant\"/> The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[Nobiin language]] today contains a number of key pastoralism related [[loanword]]s that are of Berber origin, including the terms for sheep and water/[[Nile]]. This in turn suggests that the C-Group population \u2014 which, along with the [[Kerma Culture|Kerma culture]], inhabited the Nile valley immediately before the arrival of the first [[Nubian languages|Nubian]] speakers \u2014 spoke Afro-Asiatic languages.<ref name=\"Bechaus-Gerst\"/>\n\nAdditionally, historical linguistics indicate that the [[Guanche language]], which was spoken on the [[Canary Islands]] by the ancient [[Guanches]], likely belonged to the Berber branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.<ref name=\"Hawyard\">Richard Hayward, 2000, \"Afroasiatic\", in Heine & Nurse eds, ''African Languages,'' Cambridge University Press</ref>\n\n==Examples of basic Berber words==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nThe Berber letter \"'''c'''\" is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (like the English \"'''sh'''\").\n\nThe Berber letter \"'''x'''\" is pronounced {{IPA|[\u03c7]}} (like the Spanish \"'''j'''\" or the German \"'''ch'''\" (A'''ch'''-Laut)).\n\nThe Berber letter \"'''\u0263'''\" is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0281]}} (like the French or German \"'''r'''\").\n\n===Numbers===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a [[court order]], often initiated by the [[debtor]].\n\nBankruptcy is not the only legal status that an insolvent person may have, and the term ''bankruptcy'' is therefore not a synonym for [[insolvency]]. In some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], bankruptcy is limited to individuals; other forms of insolvency proceedings (such as [[liquidation]] and [[Administration (law)|administration]]) are applied to companies. In the [[United States]], ''bankruptcy'' is applied more broadly to formal insolvency proceedings. In France, the cognate French word ''banqueroute'' is used solely for cases of fraudulent bankruptcy, whereas the term ''faillite'' (cognate of \"failure\") is used for bankruptcy in accordance with the law.<ref>(fr) Dictionnaire Le Petit Larousse 2013, p 104 & 446</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''bankruptcy'' is derived from Italian ''banca rotta'', meaning \"broken bank\", which may stem from a widespread custom in the [[Republic of Genoa]] of breaking a moneychanger's bench or counter to signify his insolvency, or which may be only a figure of speech.<ref name=\"Loveland1912\">{{cite book|author=Frank Olds Loveland|title=A treatise on the law and proceedings in bankruptcy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqE9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA4|year=1912|publisher=The W.

If a man owed and he could not pay, he and his wife, children or servants were forced into \"[[debt slavery]]\", until the creditor recouped losses through their [[Manual labour|physical labour]]. Many [[Polis|city-states]]  in ancient Greece limited debt slavery to a period of five years; debt slaves had protection of life and limb, which regular slaves did not enjoy. However, servants of the debtor could be retained beyond that [[Time limit|deadline]] by the creditor and were often forced to serve their new lord for a lifetime, usually under significantly harsher conditions. An exception to this rule was [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], which by the [[Solonian Constitution|laws]] of [[Solon]] forbade enslavement for debt; as a consequence, most Athenian slaves were foreigners (Greek or otherwise).\n\nThe [[Statute of Bankrupts Act 1542|Statute of Bankrupts]] of 1542 was the first statute under [[English law]] dealing with bankruptcy or [[insolvency]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bankruptcy |first=Edward William Donoghue |last=Manson |volume=3 |page=322}}</ref> Bankruptcy is also documented in [[East Asia]]. According to [[al-Maqrizi]], the [[Yassa]] of [[Genghis Khan]] contained a provision that mandated the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for anyone who became bankrupt three times.\n\nA failure of a nation to meet bond repayments has been seen on many occasions. [[Philip II of Spain]] had to declare four [[sovereign default|state bankruptcies]] in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. According to Kenneth S. Rogoff, \"Although the development of international capital markets was quite limited prior to 1800, we nevertheless catalog the various defaults of [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Prussia]], [[Spain]], and the early Italian city-states. At the edge of Europe, Egypt, Russia, and Turkey have histories of chronic default as well.\"<ref>Carmen M. Reinhart, Kenneth S. Rogoff (2009). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ak5fLB24ircC&pg=&dq=&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false This time is different: eight centuries of financial folly]''\".

It is important to assess the underlying problems and to minimize the risk of financial distress to re-occur. It has been stressed that debt advice, a supervised rehabilitation period, financial education and social help to find sources of income and to improve the management of household expenditures must be equally provided during this period of rehabilitation (Refiner ''et al.'', 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). In most EU Member States, debt discharge is conditioned by a partial payment obligation and by a number of requirements concerning the debtor's behavior. In the United States (US), discharge is conditioned to a lesser extent. The spectrum is broad in the EU, with the UK coming closest to the US system (Reifner et al., 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). The Other Member States do not provide the option of a debt discharge. Spain, for example, passed a bankruptcy law (''ley concurs'') in 2003 which provides for debt settlement plans that can result in a reduction of the debt (maximally half of the amount) or an extension of the payment period of maximally five years (Gerhardt, 2009), but it does not foresee debt discharge.<ref>Dubois & Anderson (2010) Managing household debts: Social service provision in the EU.

While difficult to generalize across jurisdictions, common criminal acts under bankruptcy statutes typically involve concealment of assets, concealment or destruction of documents, conflicts of interest, fraudulent claims, false statements or declarations, and [[Fee fixing scandal|fee fixing]] or redistribution arrangements. Falsifications on bankruptcy forms often constitute [[perjury]]. Multiple filings are not in and of themselves criminal, but they may violate provisions of bankruptcy law. In the U.S., bankruptcy fraud statutes are particularly focused on the [[Mens rea|mental state]] of particular actions.<ref>''See'' 140 Cong. Rec. S14, 461 (daily ed.

However, it may still work against the filer.\n\nAll assets must be disclosed in bankruptcy schedules whether or not the debtor believes the asset has a [[net value]]. This is because once a bankruptcy petition is filed, it is for the creditors, not the debtor, to decide whether a particular asset has value. The future ramifications of omitting assets from schedules can be quite serious for the offending debtor. In the United States, a closed bankruptcy may be reopened by motion of a creditor or the U.S. trustee if a debtor attempts to later assert ownership of such an \"unscheduled asset\" after being discharged of all debt in the bankruptcy. The trustee may then seize the asset and liquidate it for the benefit of the (formerly discharged) creditors. Whether or not a concealment of such an asset should also be considered for prosecution as fraud or [[perjury]] would then be at the discretion of the judge or U.S. Trustee.\n\n==By country==\n\n===Argentina===\nIn Argentina the national Act \"24.522 de Concursos y Quiebras\" regulates the Bankruptcy and the Reorganization of the individuals and companies, public entities are not included.\n\n===Australia===\n{{See also|Australian insolvency law}}\n\nIn Australia, bankruptcy is a status which applies to individuals and is governed by the federal ''Bankruptcy Act 1966''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/|title=BANKRUPTCY ACT 1966|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-01-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201112404/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/|archivedate=2017-02-01|df=}}</ref> Companies do not go bankrupt but rather go into [[liquidation]] or [[administration (insolvency)|administration]], which is governed by the federal ''[[Corporations Act 2001]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/|title=CORPORATIONS ACT 2001|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-01-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223213544/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/|archivedate=2017-02-23|df=}}</ref>\n\nIf a person commits an act of bankruptcy, then a creditor can apply to the [[Federal Circuit Court of Australia|Federal Circuit Court]] or the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] for a [[Sequestration (law)|sequestration order]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s43.html|title=BANKRUPTCY ACT 1966 - SECT 43 Jurisdiction to make sequestration orders|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-01-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191322/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s43.html|archivedate=2017-01-31|df=}}</ref> Acts of bankruptcy are defined in the legislation, and include the failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s40.html|title=BANKRUPTCY ACT 1966 - SECT 40 Acts of bankruptcy|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-01-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191822/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s40.html|archivedate=2017-01-31|df=}}</ref> A bankruptcy notice can be issued where, among other cases, a person fails to pay a [[Judgment debtor|judgment debt]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s41.html|title=BANKRUPTCY ACT 1966 - SECT 41 Bankruptcy notices|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-01-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191333/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s41.html|archivedate=2017-01-31|df=}}</ref> A person can also seek to have themself declared bankrupt by lodging a debtor's petition with the \"Official Receiver\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s55.html|title=BANKRUPTCY ACT 1966 - SECT 55 Debtor's petition|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-01-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131190947/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s55.html|archivedate=2017-01-31|df=}}</ref> which is the Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afsa.gov.au/|title=AFSA|date=2011-12-31|publisher=AFSA|accessdate=2012-04-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816033619/https://www.afsa.gov.au/|archivedate=2013-08-16|df=}}</ref>\n\nTo declare bankruptcy or for a creditor to lodge a petition, the debt must be at least $5,000.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAll bankrupts must lodge a Statement of Affairs document with AFSA, which includes important information about their assets and liabilities.

The Trustee's job includes notifying creditors of the estate and dealing with creditor inquiries; ensuring that the bankrupt complies with their obligations under the Bankruptcy Act; investigating the bankrupt's financial affairs; realising funds to which the estate is entitled under the Bankruptcy Act and distributing dividends to creditors if sufficient funds become available.\n\nFor the duration of their bankruptcy, all bankrupts have certain restrictions placed upon them. For example, a bankrupt must obtain the permission of their trustee to travel overseas. Failure to do so may result in the bankrupt being stopped at the airport by the Australian Federal Police. Additionally, a bankrupt is required to provide their trustee with details of income and assets. If the bankrupt does not comply with the Trustee's request to provide details of income, the trustee may have grounds to lodge an Objection to Discharge, which has the effect of extending the bankruptcy for a further five years.\n\nThe realisation of funds usually comes from two main sources: the bankrupt's assets and the bankrupt's wages. There are certain assets that are protected, referred to as ''protected assets''. These include household furniture and appliances, tools of the trade and vehicles up to a certain value. All other assets of value are sold. If a house or car is above a certain value, the bankrupt can buy the interest back from the estate in order to keep the asset. If the bankrupt does not do this, the interest vests in the estate and the trustee is able to take possession of the asset and sell it.\n\nThe bankrupt must pay income contributions if their income is above a certain threshold. If the bankrupt fails to pay, the trustee can issue a notice to garnishee the bankrupt's wages. If that is not possible, the Trustee may seek to extend the bankruptcy for a further five years.\n\nBankruptcies can be annulled prior to the expiration of the normal three-year period if all debts are paid out in full. Sometimes a bankrupt may be able to raise enough funds to make an Offer of Composition to creditors, which would have the effect of paying the creditors some of the money they are owed. If the creditors accept the offer, the bankruptcy can be annulled after the funds are received.\n\nAfter the bankruptcy is annulled or the bankrupt has been automatically discharged, the bankrupt's credit report status is shown as \"discharged bankrupt\" for some years. The maximum number of years this information can be held is subject to the retention limits under the Privacy Act.  How long such information is on a credit report may be shorter, depending on the issuing company, but the report must cease to record that information based on the criteria in the Privacy Act.\n\n===Brazil===\nIn [[Brazil]], the Bankruptcy Law (11.101/05) governs court-ordered or out-of-court receivership and bankruptcy and only applies to public companies (publicly traded companies) with the exception of financial institutions, credit cooperatives, consortia, supplementary scheme entities, companies administering health care plans, equity companies and a few other legal entities. It does not apply to state-run companies.\n\nCurrent law covers three legal proceedings. The first one is bankruptcy itself (\"Fal\u00eancia\"). Bankruptcy is a court-ordered liquidation procedure for an insolvent business. The final goal of bankruptcy is to liquidate company assets and pay its creditors.\n\nThe second one is Court-ordered Restructuring (''Recupera\u00e7\u00e3o Judicial''). The goal is to overcome the business crisis situation of the debtor in order to allow the continuation of the producer, the employment of workers and the interests of creditors, leading, thus, to preserving company, its corporate function and develop economic activity. It's a court procedure required by the debtor which has been in business for more than two years and requires approval by a judge.\n\nThe Extrajudicial Restructuring (''Recupera\u00e7\u00e3o Extrajudicial'') is a private negotiation that involves creditors and debtors and, as with court-ordered restructuring, also must be approved by courts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2004-2006/2005/Lei/L11101.htm |title=Brazil.

A consumer proposal is a negotiated settlement between a debtor and their creditors.\n\nA typical proposal would involve a debtor making monthly payments for a maximum of five years, with the funds distributed to their creditors. Even though most proposals call for payments of less than the full amount of the debt owing, in most cases, the creditors accept the deal\u2014because if they do not, the next alternative may be personal bankruptcy, in which the creditors get even less money. The creditors have 45 days to accept or reject the consumer proposal. Once the proposal is accepted by both the creditors and the Court, the debtor makes the payments to the Proposal Administrator each month (or as otherwise stipulated in their proposal), and the general creditors are prevented from taking any further legal or collection action. If the proposal is rejected, the debtor is returned to his prior insolvent state and may have no alternative but to declare personal bankruptcy.\n\nA consumer proposal can only be made by a debtor with debts to a maximum of $250,000 (not including the mortgage on their principal residence). If debts are greater than $250,000, the proposal must be filed under Division 1 of Part III of the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada)|Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]. An Administrator is required in the Consumer Proposal, and a Trustee in the Division I Proposal (these are virtually the same although the terms are not interchangeable). A Proposal Administrator is almost always a licensed [[trustee]] in bankruptcy, although the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy]] may appoint other people to serve as administrators.\n\nIn 2006, there were 98,450 personal insolvency filings in Canada: 79,218 bankruptcies and 19,232 consumer proposals.<ref>[http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/en/br01702e.html \"Insolvency in Canada in 2006\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329033435/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/en/br01702e.html |date=March 29, 2007 }}: Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy ([[Industry Canada]]).

Earlier a clear law on corporate bankruptcy did not exist, even though individual bankruptcy laws have been in existence since 1874. The earlier law in force was enacted in 1920 called the Provincial Insolvency Act.\n\nThe legal definitions of the terms bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation and dissolution are contested in the Indian legal system. There is no regulation or statute legislated upon bankruptcy which denotes a condition of inability to meet a demand of a creditor as is common in many other jurisdictions.\n\nWinding up of companies was in the jurisdiction of the courts which can take a decade even after the company has actually been declared insolvent. On the other hand, supervisory restructuring at the behest of the [[Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction]] is generally undertaken using receivership by a public entity.\n\n===The Netherlands===\nDutch bankruptcy law is governed by the Dutch Bankruptcy Code (''Faillissementswet''). The code covers three separate legal proceedings. \n* The first is the bankruptcy (''faillissement''). The goal of the bankruptcy is the liquidation of the assets of the company. The bankruptcy applies to individuals and companies. \n* The second legal proceeding in the ''Faillissementswet'' is the ''surseance van betaling''. The ''surseance van betaling'' only applies to companies. Its goal is to reach an agreement with the creditors of the company. Its is comparable to filing for protection against creditors. \n* The third proceeding is the ''schuldsanering''. This proceeding is designed for individuals only and is the result of a court ruling. The judge appoints a monitor. The monitor is an independent third party who monitors the individual's ongoing business and decides about financial matters during the period of the ''schuldsanering''. The individual can travel out of the country freely after the judge's decision on the case.\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Main|Insolvency law of Russia}}\nFederal Law No. 127-FZ \"On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)\" dated 26 October 2002 (as amended) (the \"Bankruptcy Act\"), replacing the previous law in 1998, to better address the above problems and a broader failure of the action.\nRussian insolvency law is intended for a wide range of borrowers: individuals and companies of all sizes, with the exception of state-owned enterprises, government agencies, political parties and religious organizations. There are also special rules for insurance companies, professional participants of the securities market, agricultural organizations and other special laws for financial institutions and companies in the [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] in the energy industry.\nFederal Law No. 40-FZ \"On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)\" dated 25 February 1999 (as amended) (the \"Insolvency Law of Credit Institutions\") contains special provisions in relation to the opening of insolvency proceedings in relation to the credit company. Insolvency Provisions Act, credit organizations used in conjunction with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nBankruptcy law provides for the following stages of insolvency proceedings:\n\u2022 Monitoring procedure or Supervision (nablyudeniye);\n\u2022 The economic recovery (finansovoe ozdorovleniye);\n\u2022 External control (vneshneye upravleniye);\n\u2022 Liquidation (konkursnoye proizvodstvo) and\n\u2022 Amicable Agreement (mirovoye soglasheniye).\n\nThe main face of the bankruptcy process is the [http://arbir.ru/contact-insolvency-officer-cheskidov-roman.htm insolvency officer (trustee in bankruptcy, bankruptcy manager)]. At various stages of bankruptcy, he must be determined: the temporary officer in Monitoring procedure, external manager in External control, the receiver or administrative officer in The economic recovery, the liquidator. During the bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy (insolvency officer) has a decisive influence on the movement of assets (property) of the debtor - the debtor and has a key influence on the economic and legal aspects of its operations.\n\n===South Africa===\n{{Main|South African insolvency law}}\n\n===Switzerland===\n{{Main|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}\nUnder [[Switzerland|Swiss]] law, bankruptcy can be a consequence of [[insolvency]]. It is a court-ordered form of debt enforcement proceedings that applies, in general, to registered commercial entities only. In a bankruptcy, all assets of the debtor are liquidated under the administration of the creditors, although the law provides for debt restructuring options similar to those under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code.\n\n===Sweden===\nIn Sweden, bankruptcy (Swedish: konkurs) is a formal process that may involve a company or individual. It is not the same as [[insolvency]], which is inability to pay debts that should have been paid. A creditor or the company itself can apply for bankruptcy. An external bankruptcy manager takes over the company or the assets of the person, and tries to sell as much as possible. A person or a company in bankruptcy can not access its assets (with some exceptions).\n\nThe formal bankruptcy process is rarely carried out for individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skatteverket.se/konkurs/vadarkonkurs.4.14db52b102ed4e5fe380002973.html |title=Konkurs&nbsp;\u2013 Vad \u00e4r konkurs? |language=sv |publisher=Skatteverket.se |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809022942/http://www.skatteverket.se/konkurs/vadarkonkurs.4.14db52b102ed4e5fe380002973.html |archivedate=2011-08-09 |df= }}</ref> Creditors can claim money through the [[Enforcement Administration (Sweden)|Enforcement Administration]] anyway, and creditors do not usually benefit from the bankruptcy of individuals because there are costs of a [[Trustee in bankruptcy|bankruptcy manager]] which has priority. Unpaid debts remain after bankruptcy for individuals. People who are deeply in debt can obtain a debt arrangement procedure (Swedish: skuldsanering). On application, they obtain a payment plan under which they pay as much as they can for five years, and then all remaining debts are cancelled. Debts that derive from a ban on business operations (issued by court, commonly for tax fraud or fraudulent business practices) or owed to a crime victim as compensation for damages, are exempted from this\u2014and, as before this process was introduced in 2006, remain lifelong.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fattiga.se/news.php?item.51.6 |title=Evighetsg\u00e4lden\u00e4rer, synpunkter fr\u00e5n Skatteverket 2004 Skatteverkets skrivelse 041229 |language=sv |publisher=Fattiga.se |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314232824/http://www.fattiga.se/news.php?item.51.6 |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}</ref> Debts that have not been claimed during a 3-10 year period are cancelled. Often crime victims stop their claims after a few years since criminals often do not have job incomes and might be hard to locate, while banks make sure their claims are not cancelled. The most common reasons for personal insolvency in Sweden are illness, unemployment, divorce or company bankruptcy.\n\nFor companies, formal bankruptcy is a normal effect of insolvency, even if there is a reconstruction mechanism where the company can be given time to solve its situation, e.g. by finding an investor. The formal bankruptcy involves contracting a bankruptcy manager, who makes certain that assets are sold and money divided by the priority the law claims, and no other way. Banks have such a priority. After a finished bankruptcy for a company, it is terminated. The activities might continue in a new company which has bought important assets from the bankrupted company.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main|UK insolvency law|Liquidation|Administration (insolvency)}}\n[[Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom]] (in a strict legal sense) relates only to individuals (including [[Sole Trader Insolvency|sole proprietors]]) and [[partnership]]s. Companies and other [[corporation]]s enter into differently named legal insolvency procedures: [[liquidation]] and [[administration (law)|administration]] ([[administration order]] and [[administrative receivership]]). However, the term 'bankruptcy' is often used when referring to companies in the media and in general conversation. Bankruptcy in Scotland is referred to as [[sequestration (law)|sequestration]]. To apply for bankruptcy in Scotland, an individual must have more than \u00a31,500 of debt.\n\nA [[trustee in bankruptcy]] must be either an [[Official Receiver]] (a civil servant) or a licensed [[insolvency practitioner]]. Current law in England and Wales derives in large part from the [[Insolvency Act 1986]]. Following the introduction of the [[Enterprise Act 2002]], a UK bankruptcy now normally last no longer than 12 months, and may be less if the Official Receiver files in court a certificate that investigations are complete. It was expected that the UK Government's liberalisation of the UK bankruptcy regime would increase the number of bankruptcy cases; initially, cases increased, as the Insolvency Service statistics appear to bear out. Since 2009, the introduction of the [[Debt Relief Order]] has resulted in a dramatic fall in bankruptcies, the latest estimates for year 2014/15 being significantly less than 30,000 cases.\n \n{| class=wikitable\n|+ UK Bankruptcy statistics\n|-\n!Year  !!Bankruptcies    !!IVAs   !!Total\n|-\n|2004 ||35,989 ||10,752 ||46,741\n|-\n|2005 ||47,291 ||20,293 ||67,584\n|-\n|2006 ||62,956 ||44,332 ||107,288\n|-\n|2007 ||64,480 ||42,165 ||106,645\n|-\n|2008 ||67,428 ||39,116 ||106,544\n|}\n\n;Pensions:\nThe UK bankruptcy law was changed in May 2000, effective May 29, 2000.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-bankruptcy/guide-to-bankruptcy|title=Guide to Bankruptcy|author=|date=|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217083152/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-bankruptcy/guide-to-bankruptcy|archivedate=17 February 2018|df=}}</ref> Debtors may now retain occupational [[pensions]] while in bankruptcy, except in rare cases.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n;Proposed reform:\nThe Government have updated legislation (2016) to streamline the application process for UK bankruptcy.

Chapter 7, known as a \"straight bankruptcy\" involves the discharge of certain debts without repayment. Chapter 13, involves a plan of repayment of debts over a period of years.

Some studies of the operation of the credit counseling requirement suggest that it provides little benefit to debtors who receive the counseling because the only realistic option for many is to seek relief under the Bankruptcy Code.<ref>Jones, Yvonne D.

In a typical consumer bankruptcy, the only debts that survive a Chapter 7 are [[student loan]]s, [[child support]] obligations, some tax bills and criminal fines. Credit cards, pay day loans, personal loans, medical bills, and just about all other bills are discharged.\n\nIn Chapter 7, a debtor surrenders non-exempt property to a bankruptcy trustee, who then liquidates the property and distributes the proceeds to the debtor's unsecured creditors. In exchange, the debtor is entitled to a discharge of some debt. However, the debtor is not granted a discharge if guilty of certain types of inappropriate behavior (e.g., concealing records relating to financial condition) and certain debts (e.g., spousal and child support and most student loans). Some taxes are not discharged even though the debtor is generally discharged from debt. Many individuals in financial distress own only exempt property (e.g., clothes, household goods, an older car, or the tools of their trade or profession) and do not have to surrender any property to the trustee.<ref name=\"C7Basics\"/> The amount of property that a debtor may exempt varies from state to state (as noted above, Virginia and Maryland have a $1,000 difference.) Chapter 7 relief is available only once in any eight-year period. Generally, the rights of secured creditors to their collateral continues, even though their debt is discharged. For example, absent some arrangement by a debtor to surrender a car or \"reaffirm\" a debt, the creditor with a [[security interest]] in the debtor's car may repossess the car even if the debt to the creditor is discharged.\n\nNinety-one percent of U.S. individuals who petition for relief under Chapter 7 hire an attorney to file their petitions.<ref name=\"uscourts.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics/BAPCPA/2013/Tables2A-2X.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215234421/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics/BAPCPA/2013/Tables2A-2X.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-15 |df= }}</ref> The typical cost of an attorney is $1,170.00.<ref name=\"uscourts.gov\"/> Alternatives to filing with an attorney are: filing pro se,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Forms/BankruptcyForms.aspx|title=Bankruptcy Forms|author=|date=|website=uscourts.gov|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505070637/http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Forms/BankruptcyForms.aspx|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=}}</ref> hiring a non-lawyer petition preparer,<ref>{{cite news|title=Preparing Petitions: It Irks the Lawyers, But Is It Lawyering?|author=Adam Liptak|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/13/us/preparing-petitions-it-irks-the-lawyers-but-is-it-lawyering.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624170126/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/13/us/preparing-petitions-it-irks-the-lawyers-but-is-it-lawyering.html|archivedate=June 24, 2017|df=}}</ref> or using online software to generate the petition.\n\nTo be eligible to file a consumer bankruptcy under Chapter 7, a debtor must qualify under a statutory \"means test\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://pewlaw.com/bankruptcy/arizona-bankruptcy-means-test/|title=Arizona Bankruptcy Means Test - Pew Law Center|newspaper=Pew Law Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108190251/http://pewlaw.com/bankruptcy/arizona-bankruptcy-means-test/|archivedate=2017-01-08|df=}}</ref> The means test was intended to make it more difficult for a significant number of financially distressed individual debtors whose debts are primarily consumer debts to qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The \"means test\" is employed in cases where an individual with primarily consumer debts has more than the average annual income for a household of equivalent size, computed over a 180-day period prior to filing. If the individual must \"take\" the \"means test\", their average monthly income over this 180-day period is reduced by a series of allowances for living expenses and secured debt payments in a very complex calculation that may or may not accurately reflect that individual's actual monthly budget. If the results of the means test show no disposable income (or in some cases a very small amount) then the individual qualifies for Chapter 7 relief. An individual who fails the means test will have their Chapter 7 case dismissed, or may have to convert the case to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\n\nIf a debtor does not qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, either because of the Means Test or because Chapter 7 does not provide a permanent solution to delinquent payments for secured debts, such as mortgages or vehicle loans, the debtor may still seek relief under Chapter 13 of the Code. A Chapter 13 plan often does not require repayment to general unsecured debts, such as credit cards or medical bills.\n\nGenerally, a trustee sells most of the debtor's assets to pay off creditors. However, certain debtor assets will be protected to some extent by bankruptcy exemptions. These include Social Security payments, unemployment compensation, limited equity in a home, car, or truck, household goods and appliances, trade tools, and books. However, these exemptions vary from state to state.\n\n=====Chapter 11=====\n{{main|Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code}}\nIn Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the debtor retains ownership and control of assets and is re-termed a [[debtor in possession]] (DIP).<ref>{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code \u00a7 1101 - Definitions for this chapter|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1101|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019221324/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1101|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}</ref> The debtor in possession runs the day-to-day operations of the business while creditors and the debtor work with the Bankruptcy Court in order to negotiate and complete a plan.

In [[France]], company insolvencies rose by more than 4%, in [[Austria]] by more than 10%, and in [[Greece]] by more than 20%. The increase in the number of insolvencies, however, does not indicate the total financial impact of insolvencies in each country because there is no indication of the size of each case. An increase in the number of bankruptcy cases does not necessarily entail an increase in bad debt write-off rates for the economy as a whole.\n\nBankruptcy statistics are also a trailing indicator. There is a time delay between financial difficulties and bankruptcy. In most cases, several months or even years pass between the financial problems and the start of bankruptcy proceedings. Legal, tax, and cultural issues may further distort bankruptcy figures, especially when comparing on an international basis. Two examples:\n* In [[Austria]], more than half of all potential bankruptcy proceedings in 2004 were not opened, due to insufficient funding.\n* In [[Spain]], it is not economically profitable to open insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings against certain types of businesses, and therefore the number of insolvencies is quite low. For comparison: In [[France]], more than 40,000 insolvency proceedings were opened in 2004, but under 600 were opened in Spain. At the same time the average bad debt write-off rate in France was 1.3% compared to Spain with 2.6%.\n\nThe insolvency numbers for private individuals also do not show the whole picture. Only a fraction of heavily indebted households file for insolvency. Two of the main reasons for this are the stigma of declaring themselves insolvent and the potential business disadvantage.\n\nFollowing the soar in insolvencies in the last decade, a number of European countries, such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy, began to revamp their bankruptcy laws in 2013. They modelled these new laws after the image of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Currently, the majority of insolvency cases have ended in liquidation in Europe rather than the businesses surviving the crisis. These new law models are meant to change this; lawmakers are hoping to turn bankruptcy into a chance for restructuring rather than a death sentence for the companies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323296504578398612178796882|title=Europe Builds Own Chapter 11|last=Ball|first=Deborah|date=2013-04-05|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-11-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122222544/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323296504578398612178796882|archivedate=2016-11-22|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Effective sovereign bankruptcy==\nTechnically, states do not collapse directly due to a [[sovereign default]] event itself.

Blissymbols differ from most of the world's major writing systems in that the characters do not correspond at all to the sounds of any [[spoken language]].\n\n==History==\nBlissymbols was invented by [[Charles K. Bliss]] (1897\u20131985), born Karl Kasiel Blitz in the Austro-Hungarian city of [[Czernowitz]] (at present the Ukrainian city of [[Chernivtsi]]), which had a mixture of different nationalities that \u201chated each other, mainly because they spoke and thought in different languages.\u201d<ref name=\"Stott\">Grant Stott (1997). [http://www.blissymbolics.us/biography/ A Great Australian. The Inventor of Semantography (Blissymbolics)]. Retrieved 18 October 2011.</ref> \nBliss graduated as a chemical engineer at the [[Vienna University of Technology]], and joined an electronics company as a research chemist.\n\nAs the German Army invaded Austria in 1938, Bliss, a [[Jew]], was sent to the concentration camps of [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]]. His German wife Claire managed to get him released, and they finally became exiles in [[Shanghai]], where Bliss had a cousin.\n\nBliss devised Blissymbols while a refugee at the [[Shanghai Ghetto]] and [[Sydney]], from 1942 to 1949. He wanted to create an easy-to-learn [[international auxiliary language]] to allow communication between different linguistic communities. He was inspired by [[Chinese character]]s, with which he became familiar at Shanghai.\n\nBliss's system was explained in his work ''Semantography'' (1949,<ref>Bliss, C. K. (1949). ''Semantography, a non-alphabetical symbol writing, readable in all languages; a practical tool for general international communication, especially in science, industry, commerce, traffic, etc., and for semantical education, based on the principles of ideographic writing and chemical symbolism''.

My friends argued that is customary to name new writing systems after the inventors .... '''Blissymbolics,''' or '''Blissymbols,''' or simply '''Bliss''' ....<ref name=\"Bliss\" /> (1965, p. 8)}}\n\nAs the \u201ctourist explosion\u201d took place in the 1960s, a number of researchers were looking for new standard symbols to be used at roads, stations, airports, etc. Bliss then adopted the name ''Blissymbolics'' in order that no researcher could plagiarize his system of symbols.\n\nSince the 1960s/1970s, Blissymbols have become popular as a method to teach disabled people to communicate.\nIn 1971 Shirley McNaughton started a pioneer program at the [[Ontario]] Crippled Children's Centre (OCCC), aimed at children with [[cerebral palsy]], from the approach of [[augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC). According to [[Arika Okrent]], Bliss used to complain about the way the teachers at the OCCC were using the symbols, in relation with the proportions of the symbols and other questions: for example, they used \u201cfancy\u201d terms like \u201cnouns\u201d and \u201cverbs\u201d, to describe what Bliss called \u201cthings\u201d and \u201cactions\u201d.<ref name=\"Okrent\">Okrent, Arika (2009), ''In the land of invented languages''. New York : Spiegel & Grau. pp. 175\u20136. {{ISBN|978-0-385-52788-0}}.</ref> (2009, p.&nbsp;173-4).\nThe ultimate objective of the OCCC program was to use Blissymbols as a practical way to teach the children to express themselves in their mother tongue, since the Blissymbols provided visual keys to understand the meaning of the English words, especially the abstract words.\n\nIn his work ''Semantography'' Bliss had not provided a systematic set of definitions for his symbols (there was a provisional vocabulary index instead <ref name=\"Bliss\" /> (1965, pp.&nbsp;827\u201367)), so McNaughton's team might often interpret a certain symbol in a way that Bliss would later criticize as a \u201cmisinterpretation\u201d. For example, they might interpret a tomato as a vegetable \u2014according to the English definition of tomato\u2014 even though the ideal Blissymbol of vegetable was restricted by Bliss to just vegetables growing underground. Eventually the OCCC staff modified and adapted Bliss's system in order to make it serve as a bridge to English.<ref name=\"Okrent\" /> (2009, p.&nbsp;189) Bliss complaints about his symbols \u201cbeing abused\u201d by the OCCC became so intense that the director of the OCCC told Bliss, on his 1974 visit, never to come back. In spite of this, in 1975 Bliss granted an exclusive world license, for use with disabled children, to the new Blissymbolics Communication Foundation directed by Shirley McNaughton (later called Blissymbolics Communication International, BCI). Nevertheless, in 1977 Bliss claimed that this agreement was violated so that he was deprived of effective control of his symbol system.<ref name=\"Stott\"/>\n\nAccording to Okrent (2009, p.&nbsp;190), there was a final period of conflict, as Bliss would make continuous criticisms to McNaughton often followed by apologies.<ref name=\"Okrent\" /> Bliss finally brought his lawyers back to the OCCC, and both parts reached a settlement:\n{{quote|In 1982, the OCCC got an exclusive, noncancelable, and perpetual license to use Blissymbolics, and he [Bliss] got $160,000. Easter Seals, the charitable foundation .... paid the settlement. .... Bliss spent the money on a big publication run of his own Blissymbols teaching manual.<ref name=\"Okrent\" /> (2009, pp. 192\u20134)}}\n{{anchor|licensing}}Blissymbolic Communication International now claims an exclusive license from Bliss, for the use and publication of Blissymbols for persons with communication, language, and learning difficulties.<ref name=\"Stott\" />\n\nThe Blissymbol method has been used in Canada, Sweden, and a few other countries. Practitioners of Blissymbolics (that is, speech and language therapists and users) maintain that some users who have learned to communicate with Blissymbolics find it easier to learn to read and write traditional orthography in the local spoken language than do users who did not know Blissymbolics.\n\n== The speech question ==\nUnlike similar constructed languages like [[AUI (constructed language)|aUI]],<ref name=\"Okrent\" /> Blissymbolics was conceived as a purely [[Visual language|visual]], speech-less language, on the premise that \u201cinterlinguistic communication is mainly carried on by reading and writing\u201d. Nevertheless, Bliss suggested that a set of international words could be adopted, so that \u201ca kind of spoken language could be established \u2013 as a travelling aid only\u201d.<ref name=\"Bliss\" /> (1965, p.&nbsp;89\u201390).\n\nSo, whether Blissymbolics constitutes an unspoken language is a controversial question, whatever its practical utility may be.  Some linguists, such as [[John DeFrancis]] <ref>DeFrancis, John (1984), ''The Chinese language : fact and fantasy''. Honolulu : University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|0-8248-0866-5}}.</ref><ref>DeFrancis, John (1989), ''Visible speech : the diverse oneness of writing systems''.

It is not certain, however, that they have examined Blissymbols.\n\n== Semantics ==\nBliss's concern about [[semantics]] finds an early referent in [[John Locke]],<ref>Locke, J. (1690). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. London.</ref> whose ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' prevented people from those \"vague and insignificant forms of speech\" that may give the impression of being deep learning.\n\nAnother vital referent is [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]\u2019s project of an ideographic language called \"[[Characteristica universalis|universal character]]\", based on the principles of Chinese characters. It would contain small figures representing \"visible things by their lines, and the invisible, by the visible which accompany them\", as well as adding \"certain additional marks, suitable to make understood the flexions and the particles.\" <ref name=\"Bliss\" /> (1965, p.&nbsp;569). Bliss stated that his own work was an attempt to take up the thread of Leibniz's project.\n\nFinally there is a strong influence by the work ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' by [[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]],<ref>C. K. Ogden & I. A. Richard (1923). ''The meaning of meaning; a study of the influence of language upon thought and of the science of symbolism''. London: K. Paul, Trench, Trubner & co., ltd; New York, Harcourt, Brace & company, inc. LC: 23009064.</ref> which was considered a standard work on semantics. Bliss found especially useful their \"triangle of reference\": the physical thing or \"referent\" that we perceive would be represented at the right angle; the meaning that we know by experience (our implicit definition of the thing), at the top angle; and the physical word that we speak or write, at the left angle. The reversed process would happen when we read or listen to words: from the words, we recall meanings, related to referents which may be real things or unreal \"fictions\". Bliss was particularly concerned with political propaganda, whose discourses would tend to contain words that correspond to unreal or ambiguous referents.\n{{See also|Transfer (propaganda)}}\n\n== Grammar ==\nThe grammar of Blissymbols is based on a certain interpretation of nature, dividing it into matter (material things), energy (actions), and human values (mental evaluations). In an ordinary language, these would give place respectively to [[substantive]]s, [[verb]]s, and [[adjective]]s. In Blissymbols, they are marked respectively by a small square symbol, a small cone symbol, and a small V or inverted cone. These symbols may be placed above any other symbol, turning it respectively into a \u201cthing\u201d, an \u201caction\u201d, and an \u201cevaluation\u201d:\n{{quote|The main manifestations of our world can be classified into matter, energy, and...mind force. '''Matter''' is symbolised by a square to indicate that the structure of matter is not chaotic...The symbol for '''energy''' indicates...the primeval [first age] action of our planet, the throwing-up of volcano cones...The symbol for human '''evaluation'''...suggests a cone standing on its point, a position which in physics is termed ''[[lability|labile]]'' [likely to fall, unstable]....All words relating to things and actions refer to something real, which exists outside of our brain. But human evaluations...depend upon the mind of each individual.<ref name=\"Bliss\" /> (1965, p. 42-43)}}\nWhen a symbol is not marked by any of the three grammar symbols (square, cone, inverted cone), they may be a non material thing, a [[grammatical particle]], etc.\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Blissymbolics.svg|50px]]\n\nThe symbol above represents the expression \"world language\", which was a first tentative name for Blissymbols.\nIt combines the symbol for \"writing tool\" or \"pen\" (a line inclined, as a pen being used) with the symbol for \"world\", which in its turn combines \"ground\" or \"earth\" (a horizontal line below) and its counterpart derivate \"sky\" (a horizontal line above). Thus the world would be seen as \"what is among the ground and the sky\", and \"Blissymbols\" would be seen as \"the writing tool to express the world\". This is clearly distinct from the symbol of \"language\", which is a combination of \"mouth\" and \"ear\". Thus natural languages are mainly oral, while Blissymbols is just a writing system dealing with semantics, not phonetics.\n\nThe 900 individual symbols of the system are called \"Bliss-characters\"; these may be \"[[ideographic]]\" \u2013 representing abstract concepts, \"[[pictographic]]\" \u2013 a direct representation of objects, or \"composite\" \u2013 in which two or more existing Bliss-characters have been superimposed to represent a new meaning. Size, orientation and relation to the \"skyline\" and \"earthline\" affects the meaning of each symbol.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.blissymbolics.org/images/bliss-rules.pdf |title = The Fundamental Rules of Blissymbolics: creating new Blissymbolics characters and vocabulary |date = September 28, 2004 |website = Blissymbolics.org |publisher = Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI) |accessdate = 1 January 2014 }} (pp. 7\u20139)</ref> A single concept is called a \"Bliss-word\", which can consist of one or more Bliss-characters. In the case of multiple character Bliss-words, the main character is called the \"classifier\" which \"indicates the semantic or grammatical category to which the Bliss-word belongs\". To this can be added Bliss-characters as prefixes or suffixes called \"modifiers\" which amend the meaning of the first symbol. A further symbol, called an \"indicator\" can be added adjacent to the Bliss-word; these are used as \"grammatical and/or semantic markers.\"<ref>Rules of Blissymbolics pp. 11\u201318</ref>\n\n[[Image:Bliss cinema.png|\"I want to go to the cinema.\" in blissymbols]]<br />\nThis sentence means \"I want to go to the cinema.\" This example shows several features of Blissymbolics:\n* The pronoun \"I\" is formed of the Bliss-character for \"person\" and the number 1 (the first person). Using the number 2 would give the symbol for singular \"You\"; adding the plural indicator (a small cross at the top) would produce the pronouns \"We\" and plural \"You\".\n* The Bliss-word for \"to want\" contains the heart which symbolizes \"feeling\" (the classifier), plus the [[Wikt:serpentine|serpentine]] line which symbolizes \"fire\" (the modifier), and the verb (called \"action\") indicator at the top.\n* The Bliss-word for \"to go\" is composed of the Bliss-character for \"leg\" and the verb indicator.\n* The Bliss-word for \"cinema\" is composed of the Bliss-character for \"house\" (the classifier), and \"film\" (the modifier); \"film\" is a composite character composed of \"camera\" and the arrow indicating movement.\n\n== Towards the international standardization of the script ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}\nAs elucidated above, Blissymbolics was used in 1971 to help children at the Ontario Crippled Children's Centre (OCCC, now the [[Bloorview Kids Rehab]]) in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Since it was important that the children see consistent pictures, OCCC had a [[draftsman]] named Jim Grice draw the symbols. Both Charles K. Bliss and Margrit Beesley at the OCCC worked with Grice to ensure consistency. In 1975, a new organization named Blissymbolics Communication Foundation directed by Shirley McNaughton led this effort. Over the years, this organization changed its name to Blissymbolics Communication Institute, [[Easter Seals (Canada)|Easter Seal]] Communication Institute, and ultimately to Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI).\n\nBCI is an international group of people who act as an authority regarding the [[standardization]] of the Blissymbolics language. It has taken responsibility for any extensions of the Blissymbolics language as well as any maintenance needed for the language. BCI has coordinated usage of the language since 1971 for augmentative and alternative communication. BCI received a licence and copyright through legal agreements with Charles K. Bliss in 1975 and 1982.  Limiting the count of Bliss-characters (there are currently about 900) is very useful in order to help the user community. It also helps when implementing Blissymbolics using technology such as computers.\n\nIn 1991, BCI published a reference guide <ref>Wood, Storr, & Reich (1992) ''Blissymbol Reference Guide''. Toronto: Blissymbolics Communication International. {{ISBN|0-9690516-9-7}}.</ref> containing 2300 vocabulary items and detailed rules for the graphic design of additional characters, so they settled a first set of approved ''Bliss-words'' for general use.\nThe [[Standards Council of Canada]] then sponsored, on January 21, 1993, the registration of an encoded character set for use in ISO/IEC 2022, in the [[ISO-IR]] international registry of coded character sets.\nAfter many years of requests, the Blissymbolic language was finally approved as an encoded language, with code <tt>zbl</tt>, into the [[ISO 639-2]] and [[ISO 639-3]] standards.\n\nA proposal was posted by [[Michael Everson]] for the Blissymbolics script to be included in the [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) and encoded for use with the [[ISO/IEC 10646]] and [[Unicode]] standards.<ref name=\"Everson\">[[Michael Everson|Everson, Michael]] (1998). [http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n1866.pdf Encoding Blissymbolics in Plane 1 of the UCS.] Retrieved 19 October 2011.</ref> BCI would cooperate with the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) and the ISO Working Group.\nThe proposed encoding does not use the lexical encoding model used in the existing ISO-IR/169 registered character set, but instead applies the Unicode and ISO character-glyph model to the ''Bliss-character'' model already adopted by BCI, since this would significantly reduce the number of needed characters.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Bliss-characters can now be used in a creative way to create many new arbitrary concepts, by surrounding the invented words with special Bliss indicators (similar to punctuation){{citation needed|date=October 2014}}, something which was not possible in the ISO-IR/169 encoding.\n\nHowever, at the end of 2009, the Blissymbolic script is still not encoded in the UCS. Some questions are still unanswered, such as the inclusion in the BCI repertoire of some characters (currently about 24) that are already encoded in the UCS (like digits, punctuation signs, spaces and some markers), but whose unification may cause problems due to the very strict graphical layouts required by the published Bliss reference guides{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}. In addition, the character metrics use a specific layout where the usual [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] is not used, and the ideographic em-square is not relevant for Bliss character designs, that use additional \"earth line\" and \"sky line\" to define the composition square.  \nSome fonts supporting the BCI repertoire are available and usable with texts encoded with [[Private Use Area|private-use assignments]] (PUA) within the UCS. But only the private BCI encoding based on ISO-IR/169 registration is available for text interchange.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]\n* [[iConji]]\n* [[Isotype (picture language)|Isotype]]\n* [[Kanji]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{official website|http://www.blissymbolics.org/}}\n** [http://www.blissymbols.co.uk/ Blissymbol Communication UK]\n* [http://www.crockford.com/blissym/lesson1.pdf An Introduction to Blissymbols] ''(PDF file)''\n* [https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/169.pdf  Standard two-byte encoded character set for Blissymbols], from the ISO-IR international registry of character sets, registration number 169 (1993-01-21).\n* [[Michael Everson]]'s [http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n1866.pdf First proposed encoding into Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 of Blissymbolics characters], based on the decomposition of the ISO-IR/169 repertoire.\n* [http://www.radiolab.org/2012/dec/17/man-became-bliss/ Radiolab program about Charles Bliss] \u2013 Broadcast December 2012 \u2013 the item about Charles Bliss starts after 5 minutes and is approx 30 mins long.\n* [http://www.blissonline.se/chart Paid on-line tool for creating Blisscharts with limited free features]\n* [http://www.blissym.com/blisscii/index.html BLISSCII], A Blissymbol font that is only made up of strokes for each Bliss-character (with the exception of 5 unique characters); thus only using 90 code points.\n\n{{Constructed languages}}\n{{list of writing systems}}\n\n[[Category:Engineered languages]]\n[[Category:Auxiliary and educational artificial scripts]]\n[[Category:International auxiliary languages]]\n[[Category:Pictograms]]\n[[Category:Scripts not encoded in Unicode]]\n[[Category:Augmentative and alternative communication]]\n[[Category:Writing systems introduced in 1949]]", "sha1": "awgp3nbl4zoebnl7fvfl15lepfvbzzj"}}, {"title": "Bessel function", "ns": "0", "id": "4700", "revision": {"id": "865507189", "parentid": "864762196", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T10:22:40Z", "contributor": {"ip": "82.49.227.224"}, "comment": "Added reference to Abramowitz and Stegun for \"first and second Bessel functions in terms of the modified Bessel functions\".", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Vibrating drum Bessel function.gif|thumb|right|Bessel functions are the radial part of the modes of vibration of a circular drum.]]\n'''Bessel functions''', first defined by the mathematician [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and then generalized by [[Friedrich Bessel]], are the [[Canonical form|canonical]] solutions {{math|''y''(''x'')}} of Bessel's [[differential equation]]\n: <math>x^2 \\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \\frac{dy}{dx} + \\left(x^2 - \\alpha^2 \\right)y = 0</math>\nfor an arbitrary [[complex number]] {{mvar|\u03b1}}, the ''order'' of the Bessel function. Although {{mvar|\u03b1}} and {{math|\u2212''\u03b1''}} produce the same differential equation for real {{mvar|\u03b1}}, it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two values in such a way that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of {{mvar|\u03b1}}.\n\nThe most important cases are when {{mvar|\u03b1}} is an [[integer]] or [[half-integer]].\nBessel functions for integer {{mvar|\u03b1}} are also known as '''cylinder functions''' or the '''[[cylindrical harmonics]]''' because they appear in the solution to [[Laplace's equation]] in [[cylindrical coordinates]]. '''[[Spherical Bessel functions]]''' with half-integer {{mvar|\u03b1}} are obtained when the [[Helmholtz equation]] is solved in [[spherical coordinates]].\n\n==Applications of Bessel functions==\nBessel's equation arises when finding separable solutions to [[Laplace's equation]] and the [[Helmholtz equation]] in cylindrical or [[spherical coordinates]]. Bessel functions are therefore especially important for many problems of [[wave propagation]] and static potentials. In solving problems in cylindrical coordinate systems, one obtains Bessel functions of integer order ({{math|''\u03b1'' {{=}} ''n''}}); in spherical problems, one obtains half-integer orders ({{math|''\u03b1'' {{=}} ''n'' + {{sfrac|1|2}}}}).

Depending upon the circumstances, however, various formulations of these solutions are convenient.

It is possible to define the function by its [[Taylor series|series expansion]] around {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, which can be found by applying the [[Frobenius method]] to Bessel's equation:<ref name=p360>Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_360.htm p. 360, 9.1.10].</ref>\n\n:<math> J_\\alpha(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\, \\Gamma(m+\\alpha+1)} {\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)}^{2m+\\alpha},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u0393''(''z'')}} is the [[gamma function]], a shifted generalization of the [[factorial]] function to non-integer values. The Bessel function of the first kind is an [[entire function]] if {{mvar|\u03b1}} is an integer, otherwise it is a [[multivalued function]] with singularity at zero. The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to {{math|{{frac|1|{{sqrt|''x''}}}}}} (see also their asymptotic forms below), although their roots are not generally periodic, except asymptotically for large {{mvar|x}}. (The series indicates that {{math|\u2212''J''<sub>1</sub>(''x'')}} is the derivative of {{math|''J''<sub>0</sub>(''x'')}}, much like {{math|\u2212sin ''x''}} is the derivative of {{math|cos ''x''}}; more generally, the derivative of {{math|''J<sub>n</sub>''(''x'')}} can be expressed in terms of {{math|''J''<sub>''n'' \u00b1 1</sub>(''x'')}} by the identities [[Bessel function#Properties|below]].)\n\n[[Image:Bessel Functions (1st Kind, n=0,1,2).svg|thumb|300px|right|Plot of Bessel function of the first kind, {{math|''J<sub>\u03b1</sub>''(''x'')}}, for integer orders {{math|''\u03b1'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2}}]]\n\nFor non-integer {{mvar|\u03b1}}, the functions {{math|''J<sub>\u03b1</sub>''(''x'')}} and {{math|''J''<sub>\u2212''\u03b1''</sub>(''x'')}} are linearly independent, and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, for integer order {{mvar|\u03b1}}, the following relationship is valid (note that the Gamma function has simple poles at each of the non-positive integers):<ref>Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_358.htm p. 358, 9.1.5].</ref>\n:<math>J_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n J_n(x).</math>\n\nThis means that the two solutions are no longer linearly independent.

In particular, it follows that:\n\n:<math>\\int_0^1 x J_\\alpha\\left(x u_{\\alpha,m}\\right) J_\\alpha\\left(x u_{\\alpha,n}\\right) \\,dx = \\frac{\\delta_{m,n}}{2} \\left[J_{\\alpha+1}\\left(u_{\\alpha,m}\\right)\\right]^2 = \\frac{\\delta_{m,n}}{2} \\left[J_{\\alpha}'\\left(u_{\\alpha,m}\\right)\\right]^2</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03b1'' > \u22121}}, {{math|''\u03b4''<sub>''m'',''n''</sub>}} is the [[Kronecker delta]], and {{math|''u''<sub>''\u03b1'',''m''</sub>}} is the {{mvar|m}}th [[root of a function|zero]] of {{math|''J<sub>\u03b1</sub>''(''x'')}}. This orthogonality relation can then be used to extract the coefficients in the [[Fourier\u2013Bessel series]], where a function is expanded in the basis of the functions {{math|''J<sub>\u03b1</sub>''(''x'' ''u''<sub>''\u03b1'',''m''</sub>)}} for fixed {{mvar|\u03b1}} and varying {{mvar|m}}.\n\nAn analogous relationship for the spherical Bessel functions follows immediately:\n\n:<math>\\int_0^1 x^2 j_\\alpha\\left(x u_{\\alpha,m}\\right) j_\\alpha\\left(x u_{\\alpha,n}\\right) \\,dx = \\frac{\\delta_{m,n}}{2} \\left[j_{\\alpha+1}\\left(u_{\\alpha,m}\\right)\\right]^2</math>\n\nIf one defines a [[boxcar function]] of {{mvar|x}} that depends on a small parameter {{mvar|\u03b5}} as:\n\n:<math>f_\\varepsilon(x)=\\varepsilon \\operatorname{rect}\\left(\\frac{x-1}\\varepsilon\\right)</math>\n\n(where {{math|rect}} is the [[rectangle function]]) then the [[Hankel transform]] of it (of any given order {{math|''\u03b1'' > \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}}}), {{math|''g<sub>\u03b5</sub>''(''k'')}}, approaches {{math|''J<sub>\u03b1</sub>''(''k'')}} as {{mvar|\u03b5}} approaches zero, for any given {{mvar|k}}. Conversely, the Hankel transform (of the same order) of {{math|''g<sub>\u03b5</sub>''(''k'')}} is {{math|''f<sub>\u03b5</sub>''(''x'')}}:\n\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty k J_\\alpha(kx) g_\\varepsilon(k) \\,dk = f_\\varepsilon(x)</math>\n\nwhich is zero everywhere except near 1. As {{mvar|\u03b5}} approaches zero, the right-hand side approaches {{math|''\u03b4''(''x'' \u2212 1)}}, where {{mvar|\u03b4}} is the [[Dirac delta function]].

The Hankel transform can express a fairly arbitrary function {{Clarify|reason=This can probably be precisely qualified e.g. square integrable etc.|date=June 2018}}as an integral of Bessel functions of different scales.

Brahui is also spoken in Sindh, mostly in [[Larkana]] and [[Nawabshah|NawabShah]] divisions.\n\n==Distribution==\nBrahui is spoken in the central part of Pakistani Balochistan, mainly in [[Kalat District|Kalat]], [[Khuzdar District|Khuzdar]], and [[Mastung District|Mastung]] districts, but also in smaller numbers in neighboring districts, as well as in [[Afghanistan]] which borders Pakistani Balochistan; however, many members of the ethnic group [[language attrition|no longer speak]] Brahui.<ref name=\"Parkin37\"/> The 2013 edition of [[Ethnologue]] reports that there are 4 million speakers of the language, and primarily in the Pakistan province of Balochistan.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} There are also an unknown very small number of expatriate Brahuis in the Arab States of the [[Persian Gulf]], Iranian Balochistan, and Turkmenistan.<ref name=\"books.google.nl\"/>\n\n==History==\nThere is no consensus as to whether Brahui is a relatively recent language introduced into Balochistan or remnant of an older widespread Dravidian language family. According to Josef Elfenbein (1989), the most common theory is that the Brahui were part of a [[proto-Dravidian people|Dravidian]] invasion of north-western India in 3rd millennium BC, but unlike other Dravidians who migrated to the south, they remained in Sarawan and Jahlawan since before 2000 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/brahui|title=BRAHUI \u2013 Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}</ref> However, some other scholars see it as a recent migrant language to its present region. They postulate that Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from [[central India]] after 1000 CE. The absence of any older Iranian ([[Avestan]]) loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a [[Northwestern Iranian language]], and moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE.<ref>{{harvnb|Witzel|1998|p=1}}, which cites {{harvnb|Elfenbein|1987}}</ref> One scholar places the migration as late as the 13th or 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Sergent|1997|pp=129\u2013130}}</ref>\n\n==Dialects==\nThere are no important dialectal differences.

BDB stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, and supports multiple data items for a single key.

This company was acquired by [[Oracle Corporation]] in February 2006, which continues to develop and sell Berkeley DB.  Under Oracle's stewardship, \"Berkeley DB\" has become a common brand name for three distinct products: Oracle Berkeley DB, Berkeley DB Java Edition, and Berkeley DB XML.  These three products all share a common ancestry and are currently under active development.\n\n==Origin==\nBerkeley DB originated at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as part of [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], Berkeley's version of the [[Unix]] operating system. After 4.3BSD (1986), the BSD developers attempted to remove or replace all code originating in the original [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] Unix from which BSD was derived. In doing so, they needed to rewrite the Unix database package.<ref name=\"freenix\">{{cite conference |last1=Olson |first1=Michael A. |last2=Bostic |first2=Keith |last3=Seltzer |first3=Margo |title=Berkeley DB |booktitle=Proc.

That request led to the creation of [[Sleepycat Software]]. This company was acquired by [[Oracle Corporation]] in February 2006, which continues to develop and sell Berkeley DB.\n\nSince its initial release, Berkeley DB has gone through various versions.  Each major release cycle has introduced a single new major feature generally layering on top of the earlier features to add functionality to the product.  The 1.x releases focused on managing key/value data storage and are referred to as \"Data Store\" (DS).  The 2.x releases added a locking system enabling concurrent access to data.  This is what is known as \"Concurrent Data Store\" (CDS).  The 3.x releases added a logging system for transactions and recovery, called \"Transactional Data Store\" (TDS).  The 4.x releases added the ability to replicate log records and create a distributed highly available single-master multi-replica database.  This is called the \"High Availability\" (HA) feature set.  Berkeley DB's evolution has sometimes led to minor API changes or log format changes, but very rarely have database formats changed.

For example, like [[SQLite]], it does not provide support for network access{{snd}} programs access the database using in-process [[Application programming interface|API]] calls.

Berkeley DB puts no constraints on the record's data. The record and its key can both be up to four gigabytes long.\n\nDespite having a simple architecture, Berkeley DB supports many advanced database features such as [[ACID]] [[Database transaction|transactions]], fine-grained [[Lock (computer science)|locking]], hot [[backup]]s and [[replication (computer science)|replication]].\n\n==Editions==\nThe name \"Berkeley DB\" is given to three different products:\n\n# Berkeley DB \u2013 the current version as of April 2016 is 6.2.\n# Berkeley DB Java Edition \u2013 the current version as of November 2017 is 7.5.11\n# Berkeley DB XML \u2013 the current version as of November 2017 is 6.1.4\n\nEach edition has separate database libraries, despite the common branding. The first is the traditional Berkeley DB, written in C. It contains several database implementations, including a [[B-tree]] and one built around [[extensible hashing]]. It supports multiple language bindings, including C/C++, Java (via JNI), C# .NET, [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].\n\nBerkeley DB Java Edition (JE) is a pure Java database management library. Its design resembles that of Berkeley DB without replicating it exactly, and has a feature set that includes many of those found in the traditional Berkeley DB and others that are specific to the Java Edition. It has a log structured storage architecture, which gives it different performance and concurrency characteristics. Three APIs are available{{snd}} a Direct Persistence Layer which is \"Plain Old Java Objects\" (POJO); one which is based on the Java Collections Framework (an object persistence approach); and one based on the traditional Berkeley DB API.  The Berkeley DB Java Edition High Availability option (Replication) is available.  Note that traditional Berkeley DB also supports a Java API, but it does so via [[Java Native Interface|JNI]] and thus requires an installed native library.\n\nThe Berkeley DB XML database specializes in the storage of XML documents, supporting [[XQuery]] via [[XQilla]]. It is implemented as an additional layer on top of (a legacy version of) Berkeley DB and the [[Xerces]] library. DB XML is written in C++ and supports multiple language bindings, including C++, Java (via JNI), [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].\n\n==Programs that use Berkeley DB==\nBerkeley DB provides the underlying storage and retrieval system of several [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] servers, database systems, and many other proprietary and free/open source applications.

In other words, it asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula [[Validity (logic)|evaluates to TRUE]]. If this is the case, the formula is called ''satisfiable''. On the other hand, if no such assignment exists, the function expressed by the formula is [[Contradiction#Contradiction in formal logic|FALSE]] for all possible variable assignments and the formula is ''unsatisfiable''. For example, the formula \"''a'' AND NOT ''b''\" is satisfiable because one can find the values ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE and ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;FALSE, which make (''a'' AND NOT ''b'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE. In contrast, \"''a'' AND NOT ''a''\" is unsatisfiable.\n\nSAT is the first problem that was proven to be [[NP-complete]]; see [[Cook\u2013Levin theorem]]. This means that all problems in the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], which includes a wide range of natural decision and optimization problems, are at most as difficult to solve as SAT. There is no known algorithm that efficiently solves each SAT problem, and it is generally believed that no such algorithm exists; yet this belief has not been proven mathematically, and resolving the question of whether SAT has a [[polynomial-time]] algorithm is equivalent to the [[P versus NP problem]], which is a famous open problem in the theory of computing.\n\nNevertheless, as of 2007, heuristic SAT-algorithms are able to solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and <!---\"clauses\" hasn't been introduced here:--->formulas consisting of millions of symbols,<ref name=\"Codish.Ohrimenko.Stuckey.2007\"/> which is sufficient for many practical SAT problems from, e.g., [[artificial intelligence]], [[circuit design]], and [[automatic theorem proving]].\n\n==Basic definitions and terminology==\nA '''[[propositional logic]] formula''', also called '''Boolean expression''', is built from [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], operators AND ([[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], also denoted by \u2227), OR ([[logical disjunction|disjunction]], \u2228), NOT ([[negation]], \u00ac), and parentheses.\nA formula is said to be '''satisfiable''' if it can be made TRUE by assigning appropriate [[logical value]]s (i.e. TRUE, FALSE) to its variables.\nThe '''Boolean satisfiability problem''' ('''SAT''') is, given a formula, to check whether it is satisfiable.\nThis [[decision problem]] is of central importance in various areas of [[computer science]], including [[theoretical computer science]], [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], [[algorithmics]], [[cryptography]] and [[artificial intelligence]].\n\nThere are several special cases of the Boolean satisfiability problem in which the formulas are required to have a particular structure. A '''literal''' is either a variable, called '''positive literal''', or the negation of a variable, called '''negative literal'''.\nA '''clause''' is a disjunction of literals (or a single literal). A clause is called a '''[[Horn clause]]''' if it contains at most one positive literal.\nA formula is in '''[[conjunctive normal form]]''' ('''CNF''') if it is a conjunction of clauses (or a single clause).\nFor example, {{math|size=100%|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} is a positive literal, {{math|size=100%|\u00ac''x''<sub>2</sub>}} is a negative literal, {{math|size=100%|''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2228 \u00ac''x''<sub>2</sub>}} is a clause, and {{math|size=100%|(''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2228 \u00ac''x''<sub>2</sub>) \u2227 (\u00ac''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2228 ''x''<sub>2</sub> \u2228 ''x''<sub>3</sub>) \u2227 \u00ac''x''<sub>1</sub>}} is a formula in conjunctive normal form; its first and third clauses are Horn clauses, but its second clause is not. The formula is satisfiable, by choosing ''x''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;FALSE, ''x''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;FALSE, and ''x''<sub>3</sub> arbitrarily, since (FALSE \u2228 \u00acFALSE) \u2227 (\u00acFALSE \u2228 FALSE \u2228 ''x''<sub>3</sub>) \u2227 \u00acFALSE evaluates to (FALSE \u2228 TRUE) \u2227 (TRUE \u2228 FALSE \u2228 ''x''<sub>3</sub>) \u2227 TRUE, and in turn to TRUE \u2227 TRUE \u2227 TRUE (i.e. to TRUE). In contrast, the CNF formula ''a'' \u2227 \u00ac''a'', consisting of two clauses of one literal, is unsatisfiable, since for ''a''=TRUE or ''a''=FALSE it evaluates to TRUE \u2227 \u00acTRUE (i.e., FALSE) or FALSE \u2227 \u00acFALSE (i.e., again FALSE), respectively.\n\nFor some versions of the SAT problem,<!---need not list them in detail here---(viz. [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|Exactly-1 3-satisfiability]], [[#XOR-satisfiability|XOR-satisfiability]], and, more general, [[#Schaefer's dichotomy theorem|Schaefer's dichotomy theorem]], discussed below),---> it is useful to define the notion of a '''generalized conjunctive normal form''' formula, viz. as a conjunction of arbitrarily many '''generalized clauses''', the latter being of the form {{math|''R''(''l''<sub>1</sub>,...,''l''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} for some boolean operator ''R'' and (ordinary) literals {{mvar|''l''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. Different sets of allowed boolean operators lead to different problem versions.<!---, see [[#Complexity and restricted versions|below]].--->As an example, ''R''(\u00ac''x'',''a'',''b'') is a generalized clause, and ''R''(\u00ac''x'',''a'',''b'') \u2227 ''R''(''b'',''y'',''c'') \u2227 ''R''(''c'',''d'',\u00ac''z'') is a generalized conjunctive normal form. This formula is used [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|below]], with ''R'' being the ternary operator that is TRUE just when exactly one of its arguments is.\n<!---need not explain that already here---If ''R'' is the ternary operator that is TRUE just if exactly one of its arguments is, then a satisfying assignment for the latter formula can be found starting from every possible combination of truth values for ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', except ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;FALSE, and choosing the values of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' appropriately; cf. the left table under [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|Exactly-1 3-satisfiability]] below.--->\n\nUsing the laws of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], every propositional logic formula can be transformed into an equivalent conjunctive normal form, which may, however, be exponentially longer. For example, transforming the formula\n(''x''<sub>1</sub>\u2227''y''<sub>1</sub>) \u2228 (''x''<sub>2</sub>\u2227''y''<sub>2</sub>) \u2228 ... \u2228 (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>\u2227''y''<sub>''n''</sub>)\ninto conjunctive normal form yields\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2227}}\n:{{math|(''y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2227}}\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2227}}\n:{{math|(''y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2227 ... \u2227}}\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2227}}\n:{{math|(''y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2227}}\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2227}}\n:{{math|(''y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;\u2228&nbsp;''y''<sub>''n''</sub>)}};\nwhile the former is a disjunction of ''n'' conjunctions of 2 variables, the latter consists of 2<sup>''n''</sup> clauses of ''n'' variables.\n\n==Complexity and restricted versions==\n\n===Unrestricted satisfiability (SAT)===\n{{Main article|Cook\u2013Levin theorem}}\n\nSAT was the first known [[NP-complete]] problem, as proved by [[Stephen Cook]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1971<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Stephen A. | authorlink1=Stephen Cook| title = The Complexity of Theorem-Proving Procedures | pages = 151\u2013158 | year = 1971 | url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/1971.pdf| doi = 10.1145/800157.805047| journal = Proceedings of the 3rd Annual ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]]}}</ref> and independently by [[Leonid Levin]] at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences#The Academy of Sciences of the USSR|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Leonid|authorlink=Leonid Levin|title = Universal search problems (Russian: \u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430, Universal'nye perebornye zadachi)|journal = Problems of Information Transmission (Russian: \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0301\u0446\u0438\u0438, Problemy Peredachi Informatsii)|volume = 9|issue = 3|pages = 115\u2013116|year = 1973}} [http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=ppi&paperid=914&volume=9&year=1973&issue=3&fpage=115&what=fullt&option_lang=eng (pdf)] {{ru icon}}, translated into English by {{cite journal|last=Trakhtenbrot|first=B.

For example, deciding whether a given [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] has a [[Graph coloring#Vertex coloring|3-coloring]] is another problem in NP; if a graph has 17 valid 3-colorings, the SAT formula produced by the Cook\u2013Levin reduction will have 17 satisfying assignments.\n\nNP-completeness only refers to the run-time of the worst case instances.  Many of the instances that occur in practical applications can be solved much more quickly.  See [[#Algorithms for solving SAT|Algorithms for solving SAT]] below.\n\nSAT is trivial if the formulas are restricted to those in '''[[disjunctive normal form]]''', that is, they are disjunction of conjunctions of literals. Such a formula is indeed satisfiable if and only if at least one of its conjunctions is satisfiable, and a conjunction is satisfiable if and only if it does not contain both ''x'' and NOT ''x'' for some variable ''x''. This can be checked in linear time. Furthermore, if they are restricted to being in '''full disjunctive normal form''', in which every variable appears exactly once in every conjunction, they can be checked in constant time (each conjunction represents one satisfying assignment).

In contrast, ordinary 3-SAT requires that every clause has ''at least'' one TRUE literal.\nFormally, a one-in-three 3-SAT problem is given as a generalized conjunctive normal form with all generalized clauses using a ternary operator ''R'' that is TRUE just if exactly one of its arguments is. When all literals of a one-in-three 3-SAT formula are positive, the satisfiability problem is called '''one-in-three positive 3-SAT'''.\n\nOne-in-three 3-SAT, together with its positive case, is listed as NP-complete problem \"LO4\" in the standard reference, ''Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness''\nby [[Michael R. Garey]] and [[David S. Johnson]].  One-in-three 3-SAT was proved to be NP-complete by [[Thomas Jerome Schaefer]] as a special case of [[Schaefer's dichotomy theorem]], which asserts that any problem generalizing Boolean satisfiability in a certain way is either in the class P or is NP-complete.<ref name=\"schaefer\">{{Cite conference | last1 = Schaefer | first1 = Thomas J. | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 1978 | title = The complexity of satisfiability problems | booktitle = Proceedings of the 10th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing | place = San Diego, California | journal =  | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 216\u2013226 | publisher =  | jstor =  | url = http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/courses/csg260/f06/materials/papers/max-sat/p216-schaefer.pdf | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nSchaefer gives a construction allowing an easy polynomial-time reduction from 3-SAT to one-in-three 3-SAT.

Velev, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=709275 Microprocessor Verification Using Efficient Decision Procedures for a Logic of Equality with Uninterpreted Functions], in Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods, pp.&nbsp;1\u201313, 1999.</ref> ''etc.'' Such extensions typically remain NP-complete, but very efficient solvers are now available that can handle many such kinds of constraints.\n\nThe satisfiability problem becomes more difficult if both \"for all\" ([[\u2200]]) and \"there exists\" ([[\u2203]]) [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s are allowed to bind the Boolean variables.\nAn example of such an expression would be {{math|size=100%|\u2200''x'' \u2200''y'' \u2203''z'' (''x'' \u2228 ''y'' \u2228 ''z'') \u2227 (\u00ac''x'' \u2228 \u00ac''y'' \u2228 \u00ac''z'')}}; it is valid, since for all values of ''x'' and ''y'', an appropriate value of ''z'' can be found, viz. ''z''=TRUE if both ''x'' and ''y'' are FALSE, and ''z''=FALSE else.\nSAT itself (tacitly) uses only \u2203 quantifiers.\nIf only \u2200 quantifiers are allowed instead, the so-called '''[[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] problem''' is obtained, which is [[co-NP-complete]].\nIf both quantifiers are allowed, the problem is called the '''[[quantified Boolean formula problem]]''' ('''QBF'''), which can be shown to be [[PSPACE-complete]]. It is widely believed that PSPACE-complete problems are strictly harder than any problem in NP, although this has not yet been proved. Using highly parallel ''[[P system]]s'', QBF-SAT problems can be solved in linear time.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Alhazov | first1 = Artiom | last2 = Mart\u00edn-Vide | first2 = Carlos | last3 = Pan | first3 = Linqiang | title = Solving a PSPACE-Complete Problem by Recognizing P Systems with Restricted Active Membranes | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2371013 | journal = Fundamenta Informaticae | volume = 58 | pages = 67\u201377 | year = 2003 }}</ref>\n\nOrdinary SAT asks if there is at least one variable assignment that makes the formula true. A variety of variants deal with the number of such assignments:\n* '''MAJ-SAT''' asks if the majority of all assignments make the formula TRUE. It is known to be complete for [[PP (complexity)|PP]], a probabilistic class.\n* '''[[Sharp-SAT|#SAT]]''', the problem of counting how many variable assignments satisfy a formula, is a counting problem, not a decision problem, and is [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]].\n* '''UNIQUE-SAT''' is the problem of determining whether a formula has exactly one assignment. It is complete for [[US (complexity)|US]], the [[complexity class]] describing problems solvable by a non-deterministic polynomial time [[Turing machine]] that accepts when there is exactly one nondeterministic accepting path and rejects otherwise.\n* '''UNAMBIGUOUS-SAT''' is the name given to the satisfiability problem when the input is [[Promise problem|restricted]] to formulas having at most one satisfying assignment. A solving algorithm for UNAMBIGUOUS-SAT is allowed to exhibit any behavior, including endless looping, on a formula having several satisfying assignments. Although this problem seems easier, Valiant and Vazirani have [[Valiant-Vazirani theorem|shown]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Valiant | first1 = L. | last2 = Vazirani | first2 = V.| doi = 10.1016/0304-3975(86)90135-0 | title = NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions | url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall05/cos528/handouts/NP_is_as.pdf| journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 47 | pages = 85\u201393 | year = 1986 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> that if there is a practical (i.e. [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|randomized polynomial-time]]) algorithm to solve it, then all problems in [[NP (complexity class)|NP]] can be solved just as easily.\n* '''MAX-SAT''', the [[maximum satisfiability problem]], is an [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]] generalization of SAT. It asks for the maximum number of clauses, which can be satisfied by any assignment. It has efficient [[approximation algorithm]]s, but is NP-hard to solve exactly. Worse still, it is [[APX]]-complete, meaning there is no [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] (PTAS) for this problem unless P=NP.\n\nOther generalizations include satisfiability for [[first-order predicate calculus|first]]- and [[second-order logic]], [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s, [[0-1 integer programming]].\n\n==Self-reducibility==\nThe SAT problem is '''self-reducible''', that is, each algorithm which correctly answers if an instance of SAT is solvable can be used to find a satisfying assignment. First, the question is asked on the given formula \u03a6. If the answer is \"no\", the formula is unsatisfiable. Otherwise, the question is asked on the partly instantiated formula \u03a6[[substitution (logic)|{''x''<sub>1</sub>=TRUE}]], i.e. \u03a6 with the first variable ''x''<sub>1</sub> replaced by TRUE, and simplified accordingly. If the answer is \"yes\", then ''x''<sub>1</sub>=TRUE, otherwise ''x''<sub>1</sub>=FALSE. Values of other variables can be found subsequently in the same way. In total, ''n''+1 runs of the algorithm are required, where ''n'' is the number of distinct variables in \u03a6.\n\nThis property of self-reducibility is used in several theorems in complexity theory:\n\n: [[NP (complexity)|NP]] \u2286 [[P/poly]] \u21d2 [[PH (complexity)|PH]] = [[Polynomial hierarchy#Definitions|\u03a3<sub>2</sub>]] &nbsp; ([[Karp\u2013Lipton theorem]])\n: [[NP (complexity)|NP]] \u2286 [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]] \u21d2 [[NP (complexity)|NP]] = [[RP (complexity)|RP]]\n: [[P (complexity)|P]] = [[NP (complexity)|NP]] \u21d2 [[FP (complexity)|FP]] = [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]]\n\n==Algorithms for solving SAT==\n\nSince the SAT problem is NP-complete, only algorithms with exponential worst-case complexity are known for it. In spite of this, efficient and scalable algorithms for SAT were developed over the last decade{{When|date=July 2016}} and have contributed to dramatic advances in our ability to automatically solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and millions of constraints (i.e. clauses).<ref name=\"Codish.Ohrimenko.Stuckey.2007\">{{citation|title=Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming \u2013 CP 2007|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=4741|year=2007|pages=544\u2013558|contribution=Propagation = Lazy Clause Generation|first1=Olga|last1=Ohrimenko|first2=Peter J.|last2=Stuckey|first3=Michael|last3=Codish|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74970-7_39|quote=modern SAT solvers can often handle problems with millions of constraints and hundreds of thousands of variables|citeseerx=10.1.1.70.5471}}.</ref> Examples of such problems in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) include [[formal equivalence checking]], [[model checking]], [[formal verification]] of [[microprocessor|pipelined microprocessors]],<ref name=\"Bryant.German.Velev.1999\"/> [[automatic test pattern generation]], [[routing (electronic design automation)|routing]] of [[FPGA]]s,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Gi-Joon Nam | last2 = Sakallah | first2 = K.

The basic search procedure was proposed in two seminal papers in the early 1960s (see references below) and is now commonly referred to as the [[Davis\u2013Putnam\u2013Logemann\u2013Loveland algorithm]] (\"DPLL\" or \"DLL\").<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. | last2 = Putnam | first2 = H. | title = A Computing Procedure for Quantification Theory | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 201 | year = 1960 | doi = 10.1145/321033.321034}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. |authorlink1=Martin Davis| last2 = Logemann | first2 = G. | last3 = Loveland | first3 = D. | title = A machine program for theorem-proving | journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]| volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 394\u2013397 | year = 1962 | url = http://www.ensiie.fr/~blazy/ipr/article2.pdf| doi = 10.1145/368273.368557}}</ref> Theoretically, exponential lower bounds have been proved for the DPLL family of algorithms.\n\nIn contrast, randomized algorithms like the PPSZ algorithm by Paturi, Pudlak, Saks, and Zane set variables in a random order according to some heuristics, for example bounded-width [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]]. If the heuristic can't find the correct setting, the variable is assigned randomly. The PPSZ algorithm has a runtime of <math>O(2^{0.386n})</math> for 3-SAT with a single satisfying assignment. Currently this is the best-known runtime for this problem. In the setting with many satisfying assignments the randomized algorithm by Sch\u00f6ning has a better bound.<ref name=\"Schoning.1999\"/><ref name=\"ppsz_algorithm\">[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1066101 \"An improved exponential-time algorithm for k-SAT\"], Paturi, Pudlak, Saks, Zani</ref>\n\nModern SAT solvers (developed in the last ten years{{When|date=July 2016}}) come in two flavors: \"conflict-driven\" and \"look-ahead\".{{clarify|reason=3 paragraphs before here, 'two classes', viz.

[[backjumping]]), as well as [[\"two-watched-literals\" unit propagation]], adaptive branching, and random restarts. These \"extras\" to the basic systematic search have been empirically shown to be essential for handling the large SAT instances that arise in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA).<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Vizel | first1 = Y. | last2 = Weissenbacher | first2 = G. | last3 = Malik | first3 = S. | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 103 | issue = 11 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2015.2455034|title=Boolean Satisfiability Solvers and Their Applications in Model Checking}}</ref> Look-ahead solvers have especially strengthened reductions (going beyond unit-clause propagation) and the heuristics, and they are generally stronger than conflict-driven solvers on hard instances (while conflict-driven solvers can be much better on large instances which actually have an easy instance inside).\n\nModern SAT solvers are also having significant impact on the fields of software verification, constraint solving in artificial intelligence, and operations research, among others. Powerful solvers are readily available as [[free and open source software]]. In particular, the conflict-driven [http://minisat.se/ MiniSAT], which was relatively successful at the [http://www.satcompetition.org/ 2005 SAT competition], only has about 600 lines of code. A modern Parallel SAT solver is [http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~jabbour/manysat.htm ManySAT]. It can achieve super linear speed-ups on important classes of problems. An example for look-ahead solvers is [http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/sat/march_dl.php march_dl], which won a prize at the [http://www.satcompetition.org/ 2007 SAT competition].\n\nCertain types of large random satisfiable instances of SAT can be solved by [[survey propagation]] (SP). Particularly in [[hardware design]] and [[hardware verification|verification]] applications, satisfiability and other logical properties of a given propositional formula are sometimes decided based on a representation of the formula as a [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD).\n\nAlmost all SAT solvers include time-outs, so they will terminate in reasonable time even if they cannot find a solution.\nDifferent SAT solvers will find different instances easy or hard, and some excel at proving unsatisfiability, and others at finding solutions.\nAll of these behaviors can be seen in the SAT solving contests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satcompetition.org/ |title=The international SAT Competitions web page|accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Unsatisfiable core]]\n*[[Satisfiability modulo theories]]\n*[[Sharp-SAT|Counting SAT]]\n*[[Karloff\u2013Zwick algorithm]]\n*[[Circuit satisfiability]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\nReferences are ordered by date of publication:\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book|author = Michael R.

The toponym ''Boiohaemum,'' first attested by [[Tacitus]],<ref>Tacitus, ''Germania'' 28.</ref> is commonly taken to mean \"home of the Boii\" (from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Germanic]] root *''haima-'' meaning \"world, home\"). \n\nThe word \"Bohemian\" has never been widely used by the local Czech population. In [[Czech language|Czech]], the region since the early Middle Ages has been called ''\u010cechy'' but also, especially during the period of restoration/emancipation of the Czech language and nation, as ''\u010cechie.'' Another term, stressing the importance of the state/nation, is ''Kr\u00e1lovstv\u00ed \u010desk\u00e9'' (\"Czech Kingdom\") in Czech, or ''B\u00f6hmen'' (K\u00f6nigreich) in German. Its mainly Czech-speaking inhabitants were called ''\u010cechov\u00e9'' (in modern Czech ''\u010ce\u0161i'').\n\nIn most other Western European vernaculars and in Latin (as ''Bohemi''), the word \"Bohemian\" or a derivate was used. If the Czech ethnic origin was to be stressed, combinations such as  \"Bohemian of Bohemian language\" (''\u010cech \u010desk\u00e9ho jazyka''), \"a real Bohemian\" (''prav\u00fd \u010cech''), etc. were used.\n\nIt was not until the 19th century that other European languages began to use words related to  \"Czechs\" (as in English, ''Tschechien'' in [[German language|German]], ''Tch\u00e8ques'' in [[French language|French]]) in a deliberate (and successful) attempt to distinguish between ethnic Slavic-speaking Bohemians and other inhabitants of Bohemia. The latter were mostly [[ethnic Germans]], who identified as \"German Bohemians\" (''Deutschb\u00f6hmen'') or simply as \"Bohemians\" (''B\u00f6hmen''). In many parts of Europe, state citizenship was not identical with ethnicity and language, and the various peoples were usually identified by their language. Ethnic boundaries in Bohemia were not always sharp, and people very often were bilingual. Intermarriages across language borders were also common. Native Czech speakers often spoke German and many native German speakers spoke Czech with varying fluency, particularly in areas with many Czech speakers.\n\nCurrently, the word \"Bohemians\" is sometimes used when speaking about persons from Bohemia of all ethnic origins, especially before the year 1918, when the Kingdom of Bohemia ceased to exist. It is also used to distinguish between inhabitants of the western part (Bohemia proper) of the state, and the eastern ([[Moravia]]) or north-eastern ([[Czech Silesia|Silesia]]) parts.\n\nThe different term \"[[Bohemianism]]\" was associated with \"a socially unconventional person, especially one who is involved in the arts\", that comes from the French word ''boh\u00e9mien.''<ref name = Oxford/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Name of the Czech Republic]]\n* [[Czech studies|Bohemistics]]\n\n== References ==\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bohemia|Bohemian]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:West Slavs]]", "sha1": "r1p895uq7l3z1kt25qb1efcp2uh9wij"}}, {"title": "Bob Jones University", "ns": "0", "id": "4717", "revision": {"id": "865690463", "parentid": "865611509", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T15:07:35Z", "contributor": {"username": "BarrelProof", "id": "13560851"}, "comment": "[[MOS:LQ]], {{when}}", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox University\n|name=Bob Jones University\n|native_name=\n|latin_name=\n|image_name= Bob Jones University logo (adopted 2013).png\n|caption= BJU logo, introduced in 2013 <ref>BJU replaced a \"BJ\" logo that had been used since 1967 with a new shield based on the university crest.</ref>\n|motto=''Petimus Credimus'' ([[Latin]])\n|coor = {{coord|34.873|-82.364|type:edu_region:US-SC|display=inline,title}}\n|mottoeng=We seek, we trust\n|established=1927\n|type=[[Private university|Private]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.sc.gov/index.asp?n=18&p=4&s=18&corporateid=19735|title=BJU Listing|publisher=S.C.

Children of church members were attending college, only to reject the faith of their parents. Jones later recalled that in 1924, his friend [[William Jennings Bryan]] had leaned over to him at a Bible conference service in [[Winona Lake, Indiana]], and said, \"If schools and colleges do not quit teaching [[evolution]] as a fact, we are going to become a nation of atheists.\"<ref>Turner, 19</ref> While he himself was not a college graduate, Jones grew determined to found a college, and on September 12, 1927, he opened Bob Jones College in [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]], Florida, with 88 students. Jones said that although he had been averse to naming the school after himself, his friends overcame his reluctance \"with the argument that the school would be called by that name because of my connection with it, and to attempt to give it any other name would confuse the people\".<ref>Turner, 23\u201325. In the earliest years of the college, important contributions were made to its stability by J. Floyd Collins and [[Eunice Hutto]]. Johnson, 180, 198.</ref>\n\nBob Jones took no salary from the college and helped support the school with personal savings and income from his evangelistic campaigns. Both time and place were inauspicious. The [[Florida land boom]] had peaked in 1925, and a hurricane in September 1926 further reduced land values. The [[Great Depression]] followed hard on its heels. Bob Jones College barely survived [[bankruptcy]] and its move to [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] in 1933. In the same year, the college also ended participation in intercollegiate sports. Nevertheless, Jones's move to Cleveland proved extraordinarily advantageous.  Bankrupt at the nadir of the Depression, without a home, and with barely enough money to move its library and office furniture, the college became in thirteen years the largest [[liberal arts]] college in Tennessee. With the enactment of the [[GI Bill]] at the end of [[World War II]], the need for campus expansion to accommodate increased enrollment led to a relocation to South Carolina.<ref>Turner, 68, 101\u201302.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bju.edu/about/history.php|title=History of BJU|website=Bob Jones University|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref>\n\nThough he had served as Acting President as early as 1934, Jones' son, [[Bob Jones, Jr.]] officially became the school's second president in 1947 just before the college moved to [[Greenville, South Carolina]], and became Bob Jones University.<ref>Turner, 57\u201358.

Britain's [[Westminster System]] of governance has left a legacy of parliamentary democracies in many former colonies.]]\nDecades, and in some cases centuries, of British rule and emigration have left their mark on the independent nations that arose from the British Empire. The empire established the use of English in regions around the world. Today it is the primary language of up to 460 million people and is spoken by about one and a half billion as a first, second or foreign language.<ref>[[#refHogg|Hogg]], p.&nbsp;424 chapter 9 ''English Worldwide'' by [[David Crystal]]: \"approximately one in four of the worlds population are capable of communicating to a useful level in English\".</ref>\n\nThe spread of English from the latter half of the 20th century has been helped in part by the cultural and economic influence of the United States, itself originally formed from British colonies. Except in Africa where nearly all the former colonies have adopted the [[presidential system]], the English [[parliamentary system]] has served as the template for the governments for many former colonies, and [[English law|English common law]] for legal systems.{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=307}}\n\n[[File:\u0d15\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d7e \u0d15\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d31\u0d4d\u0d31\u0d4d \u0d15\u0d33\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d41\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d41.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cricket]] being played in [[India]].

Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities, and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe.

It is the first installment of [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Batman (1989 film series)|initial ''Batman'' film series]]. The film stars [[Michael Keaton]] as Bruce Wayne/Batman and [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Joker (character)|the Joker]], alongside [[Kim Basinger]], [[Robert Wuhl]], [[Pat Hingle]], [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[Michael Gough]] and [[Jack Palance]]. The film takes place early in the title character's war on crime, and depicts a battle with his nemesis the Joker.\n\nAfter Burton was hired as director in 1986, [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Julie Hickson]] wrote [[film treatment]]s before [[Sam Hamm]] wrote the first screenplay. ''Batman'' was not [[greenlight|greenlit]] until after the success of Burton's ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988). Numerous [[A-list]] actors were considered for the role of Batman  before Keaton was cast. Keaton's casting caused a controversy since, by 1988, he had become [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role.<ref name=\"Elfman\" /> Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated top [[Billing (filmmaking)|billing]], a high salary, a portion of the [[box office]] profits and his shooting schedule.\n\nThe tone and themes of the film were influenced in part by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Brian Bolland]]'s ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]''. The film primarily adapts the \"[[The Man Behind the Red Hood!|Red Hood]]\" [[origin story]] for the Joker, in which Batman creates the Joker by dropping him into [[Axis Chemical]] acid, resulting in his transformation into a psychopath, but it adds a unique twist in presenting him specifically as a [[gangster]] named Jack Napier. Filming took place at [[Pinewood Studios]] from October 1988 to January 1989. The budget escalated from [[United States dollar|$]]30 million to $48 million, while the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]] forced Hamm to drop out. [[Warren Skaaren]] did rewrites. Additional uncredited drafts were done by [[Charles McKeown]] and [[Jonathan Gems]].\n\n''Batman'' was a critical and financial success, earning over $400 million in box office totals. It was the fifth-highest-grossing film in history at the time of its release. The film received several [[Saturn Award]] nominations and a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination, and won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. It also inspired the equally successful ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', paving the way for the [[DC animated universe]], and has influenced [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s modern marketing and development techniques of the [[superhero film]] genre. Three sequels, ''[[Batman Returns]]'', ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', were released on June 19, 1992, June 16, 1995, and June 20, 1997, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nAs [[Gotham City]] approaches its [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]], Mayor Borg orders district attorney [[Harvey Dent]] and police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] to make the city safer. Meanwhile, reporter Alexander Knox and photojournalist [[Vicki Vale]] begin to investigate rumors of a vigilante nicknamed \"[[Batman]]\" who is targeting the city's criminals.\n\nBatman's alter-ego is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire industrialist who, as a child, witnessed his parents' murder at the hands of a psychotic mugger. At a fundraiser for the bicentennial in Wayne Manor, Bruce meets and falls for Vale, and the two begin a romantic relationship. However, the evening is cut short as Bruce is alerted to Commissioner Gordon's sudden departure due to police business and leaves to investigate as Batman.\n\nMob boss Carl Grissom, who has already been targeted by Dent and Gordon, discovers his mistress Alicia is involved with his second-in-command Jack Napier. With the help of corrupt police lieutenant Max Eckhardt, Grissom engineers Napier's death in a raid at [[Ace Chemicals|Axis Chemicals]]. However, Grissom's plan is foiled with the sudden arrival of Commissioner Gordon, who wants Napier captured alive. In the ensuing shootout, Napier, who has realized he was set up, kills Eckhardt. Batman arrives and, in a struggle, Napier is knocked into a vat of chemicals. Batman escapes and Napier is presumed dead.\n\nNapier emerges from the vat, but is left disfigured with chalk white skin, emerald green hair, and a [[rictus grin]]. The sociopathic Napier is driven insane by the incident and begins calling himself [[Joker (character)|\"the Joker\"]]. He kills Grissom and usurps authority over his criminal empire, and scars Alicia's face to equal his disfigurement.\n\nThe Joker terrorizes Gotham City by lacing hygiene products with \"Smylex\", a deadly chemical which causes victims to [[Death from laughter|die laughing]] with the same maniacal grin as the Joker. As he searches for information on Batman (whom he blames for his disfigurement), the Joker also becomes obsessed with Vale. He lures her to the Gotham Museum of Art and his henchmen [[Vandalism|destroy the works of art]]. Batman arrives and rescues her. They escape in the [[Batmobile]], pursued by the Joker's men. Batman takes Vicki to the [[Batcave]], where he gives her information from his research on Smylex that will allow the city's residents to avoid exposure to the toxin.\n\nBruce visits Vicki at her apartment, prepared to tell her about his alter-ego. The Joker interrupts their meeting, asking Bruce, \"You ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?\" before shooting him. Bruce uses a bended serving tray as body armor and plays dead. He remembers that the mugger who killed his parents asked the same question, and realizes that Napier was his parents' killer. Vicki is brought to the Batcave by Bruce's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], who has been coaxing their relationship because Vicki brings out Bruce's human side. After telling her that he cannot focus on their relationship with the Joker terrorizing Gotham, Bruce departs as Batman to destroy the Axis plant. Meanwhile, the Joker lures the citizens of Gotham to a parade with the promise of free money, but while throwing cash at the crowd as promised, also attacks them with Smylex gas released from his giant parade balloons. Batman arrives and tows the balloons above the clouds with the [[Batplane|Batwing]]. The Joker shoots the Batwing using a long-barreled gun, causing it to crash, and takes Vicki to the top of a cathedral.\n\nBatman, who survived the crash, fends off the Joker's remaining men despite his injuries, and confronts the Joker. The two struggle, with Joker eventually gaining the upper hand, leaving Batman and Vicki clinging onto an outcropping. The Joker tries to escape by helicopter, but Batman attaches a heavy granite [[gargoyle]] to the Joker's leg with his grappling hook, causing him to lose his grip and fall to his death after it breaks off.\n\nCommissioner Gordon announces that the police have arrested the Joker's men and unveils the [[Bat-Signal]]. Harvey Dent reads a note from Batman, promising that he will defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again. Vicki is taken to [[Wayne Manor]] by Alfred, who tells her that Bruce will be a little late. She responds that she is not surprised, as Batman looks at the signal's projection from a rooftop, standing watch over the city.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Michael Keaton]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n*[[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Joker (comics)|Jack Napier / The Joker]]\n*[[Kim Basinger]] as [[Vicki Vale]]\n*[[Robert Wuhl]] as Alexander Knox\n*[[Pat Hingle]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]\n*[[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]]\n*[[Michael Gough]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]\n*[[Jack Palance]] as Carl Grissom\n*[[Jerry Hall]] as Alicia Hunt\n*[[Tracey Walter]] as Bob the Goon\n*[[Lee Wallace (actor)|Lee Wallace]] as Mayor Borg \n*[[William Hootkins]] as Lt.

Released by [[20th Century Fox]], the film starred [[Adam West]] as Batman and [[Burt Ward]] as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. The film hit theaters two months after the [[List of Batman television episodes#Season 1: 1966|last episode of the first season]] of the television series. The film includes most members of the original TV cast, with the exception of [[Lee Meriwether]] as [[Catwoman]], the character previously played by [[Julie Newmar]] in two episodes of the series' first season.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Batman and Robin get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp is in danger aboard his yacht, they launch a rescue mission using the [[Batcopter]]. As Batman descends on the bat-ladder to land on the yacht, it suddenly vanishes beneath him. He rises out of the sea with a shark attacking his leg. After Batman dislodges it with bat-[[shark repellent]], the shark explodes. Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in [[Gotham City]]: [[Joker (character)|The Joker]], [[Penguin (character)|The Penguin]], [[Riddler|The Riddler]], and [[Catwoman]].\n\nThe United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Schmidlapp, who is unaware that he has been kidnapped), a submarine made to resemble a [[penguin]], and their three pirate henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). It is revealed the yacht was really a projection. When Batman and Robin return to a buoy concealing a projector, they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. Catwoman, disguised as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] journalist \"Kitayna Ireyna Tatanya Kerenska Alisoff\" (acronymed as Kitka), helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of a plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of the Penguin's explosive animals (not knowing that Bruce Wayne is Batman's alter-ego). After Bruce Wayne escapes captivity, the Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the [[Batcave]] along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into [[antimatter]] once struck: The Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with [[heavy water]], used to recharge the Batcave's [[atomic pile]].\n\nUltimately, Batman and Robin are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated [[United Nations Security Council|United World Organization's Security Council]]. Giving chase in the [[batboat]] to retrieve them (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a sonic charge weapon to disable The Penguin's submarine and force it to surface, where a fist fight ensues. Although Batman and Robin win the fight, Batman is heartbroken to find out that his \"true love\" Miss Kitka is actually Catwoman when her mask falls off. Commodore Schmidlapp accidentally breaks the vials containing the powdered Council members, mixing them together.\n\nBatman sets to work, constructing an elaborate filter to separate the mingled dust. Robin asks him whether it might be in the world's best interests for them to alter the dust samples, so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so, reminding Robin of the fate of the Penguin's henchmen and their tainted rehydration, and can only hope for people in general to learn to live together peacefully on their own.\n\nWith the world watching, the [[Security Council]] is re-hydrated. All of the members are restored alive and well, but continue to squabble amongst themselves, totally oblivious of their surroundings, but each of them now speaks the language and displays the stereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own. Batman quietly expresses his sincere hope to Robin that this \"mixing of minds\" does more good than it does harm. The duo quietly leave [[United Nations Headquarters|United World Headquarters]] by climbing out of the window and descending on their batropes.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Batman villains The Penguin The Riddler The Joker 1967.JPG|thumb|180px|The Penguin ([[Burgess Meredith]]), the Riddler ([[Frank Gorshin]]) and the Joker ([[Cesar Romero]]) in 1966.

According to the [[Biography (TV Series)|Biography]] special [[Catwoman]]: Her Many Lives, aired on July 20, 2004, it was stated that Newmar was unable to reprise her role due to a reported back injury. [[Catwoman]] was nonetheless played by Newmar once again in the following eleven episodes of [[List of Batman television episodes#Season 2: 1966\u201367|season two]] of the series; [[Eartha Kitt]] would then play [[Catwoman]] in three episodes of [[List of Batman television episodes#Season 3: 1967\u201368|season three]].\n\nIn his autobiography, [[Adam West]] writes of his asking for more money to do the film and that the producers countered with the fact that another actor would be hired. ''Batman'' was Denny's final film appearance. [[Jack LaLanne]] has a cameo as a man on a rooftop with bikini-clad women.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kiddiematinee.com/b-batman.html |title=BATMAN (1966, U.S.) |publisher=Kiddiematinee.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220084913/http://kiddiematinee.com/b-batman.html |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[William Dozier]] wanted to make a big-screen film to generate interest in his proposed [[Batman]] TV series by having the feature in theaters while the first season of the series was rolling before the cameras. The studio, [[20th Century Fox]], refused because it would have to cover the entire cost of a movie, while it would only have to share the cost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).<ref>Garcia, Bob, \"Batman: Making the Original Movie\", ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Volume 24, #6/Vol. 25, #1 (double issue), February 1994, p. 55.</ref>\n\nThe film features many characters from the show.

They felt the film's depiction of the Caped Crusader \"captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly\".<ref>[http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/batman-66.html Stomp Tokyo Video Reviews - Batman (1966)].

The movie, like the TV series, is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s serials of Batman, such as the escapes done almost out of luck.<ref name=\"Groucho\" /> The penchant for giving devices a \"Bat-\" prefix and the dramatic use of stylized title cards during fight scenes acknowledge some of the conventions that the character had accumulated in various media. However, the majority of ''Batman''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid-1960s culture in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/batman/batman.htm |title=Museum of Broadcast Communication's entry on the parent TV show |publisher=Museum.TV |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the movie represented Batman's first major foray into [[Cold War]] issues paying heavy attention to [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris Missiles]], [[War surplus|war surplus submarines]] and taking a poke at [[the Pentagon]]. The inclusion of a glory-hunting presidential character and the unfavorable portrayal of Security Council Members marked Batman's first attempts to poke fun at domestic and international politics.<ref>Batman at 45: A Milestone Tribute to Pow, Bam and Zap!, Chris Gould, 2011</ref>\n\n===Vehicles===\n[[File:1960s Batmobile (FMC).jpg|thumb|right|The Batmobile as seen in the 1960s ''Batman'' TV series.]]\nBesides the [[Batmobile]], other vehicles used by The Dynamic Duo include:\n* [[Batcycle]] with side car\n* [[Batboat]], provided by [[Glastron]]\n* [[Batcopter]]\n\nOf the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the ''Batman'' film, only the [[Batcycle]] properly crossed over into the [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]] as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the full use of the others. While the [[Batcopter]] and [[Batboat]] from the movie appeared briefly in episodes (including a use of the Batboat in the conclusion of the first post-film two-parter: \"[[Walk the Straight and Narrow]]\"), they primarily did so in the form of stock-footage scenes from the film intercut into the series.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n[[Nelson Riddle]]'s original score to ''Batman the Movie'' was released in 2010 by [[La-La Land Records]] and [[Fox Music]].

It is the second installment of [[Warner Bros.]] [[Batman (1989 film series)|initial ''Batman'' film series]], with [[Michael Keaton]] reprising the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The film, produced by [[Denise Di Novi]] and Burton, also stars [[Danny DeVito]] as [[Penguin (character)|the Penguin]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Catwoman]], and [[Christopher Walken]] as corrupt businessman Max Shreck.\n \nBurton originally did not want to direct another Batman film. Warner Bros. developed a script with [[Sam Hamm]] which had the Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure. Burton agreed to return after they granted him more creative control and replaced Hamm with [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]]. After a falling out, Waters was removed from the project and [[Wesley Strick]] was chosen to do an uncredited rewrite shortly before filming. This included normalizing dialogue, fleshing out the Penguin's motivations and master plan and removing scenes due to budget concerns. Strick continued working as the on-set writer all through filming, an early trailer credited Strick as co-screenwriter with Waters having sole story credit but after a dispute from Hamm he received no credit whatsoever. [[Annette Bening]] was originally cast as Catwoman but became pregnant and was replaced with Pfeiffer.\n\n''Batman Returns'' was released on June 19, 1992. The film was nominated for [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], as well as two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards. Its budget was $80 million and it grossed $266.8 million worldwide, making the film a financial success. The film received positive reviews, with critics praising its action sequences, performances, [[Danny Elfman]]'s score, effects, and villains, although its dark tone was criticized.\n\nA follow-up, ''[[Batman Forever]]'', was released in 1995, with [[Val Kilmer]] replacing Keaton as Batman.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the prologue, socialites Tucker and Esther Cobblepot give birth to a deformed baby boy, Oswald. Disgusted by his appearance and wild demeanor, they confine the baby to a cage and ultimately throw him into the sewer, where he is discovered by a family of penguins at Gotham Zoo.\n\nThirty-three years later, millionaire Max Shreck proposes to build a power plant to supply Gotham City with energy, though he is opposed by the city mayor. During Shreck's speech, Gotham is attacked by a disgraced former circus troupe, the Red Triangle Gang. Despite the efforts of Batman to stop the violence, Shreck is abducted and taken to the sewer, where he meets Oswald Cobblepot, the gang's secret leader now known as the Penguin. The Penguin blackmails Shreck with evidence of his corporate crimes into helping him return to the surface, and he accepts. Meanwhile, Shreck's secretary, Selina Kyle, discovers the true purpose of Shreck's power plant to drain Gotham of its energy and bring the city under Shreck's control. Shreck pushes her out of a window to silence her, but she survives the fall and vows revenge, taking up the mantle of Catwoman.\n\nThe Penguin makes his presence known by \"rescuing\" the Mayor's baby from a staged kidnapping attempt, and requests to be allowed into the Hall of Records to find his parents. Batman's alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, voices his suspicions about the Penguin's true motives, and investigates his background and connection to the Red Triangle Gang. During a meeting with Shreck, Wayne meets Kyle and the two become attracted to one another. In order to remove his enemies, Shreck pushes for the Penguin to run for mayor and discredit the current mayor by having the Red Triangle Gang wreak havoc on the city. Batman intervenes and meets Catwoman as she attempts to sabotage one of Shreck's businesses; she escapes, but is injured and swears revenge on Batman by allying with the Penguin to frame him for an undiscussed crime.\n\nAs Wayne and Kyle begin a romantic relationship, the Penguin abducts Gotham's Ice Princess and kills her, framing Batman for the act, at the same time sabotaging his Batmobile to rampage throughout Gotham (until Batman disconnects the controlling device), and ends his partnership with Catwoman, who didn't anticipate the murder, when she rejects his advances; he attempts to kill her with one of his flying umbrellas, but she survives after falling into a greenhouse. During the chase, Batman records the Penguin's disparaging remarks about the people of Gotham and later plays them during his next speech, destroying his image and forcing him to retreat to the sewer, where he reveals his plan to abduct and kill all of Gotham's firstborn sons as revenge for what his parents did to him. At a charity ball hosted by Shreck, Wayne and Kyle meet and discover each other's secret identities. The Penguin appears and reveals his plan, intending to take Shreck's son, Chip, with him, but Shreck gives himself up in his son's stead.\n\nBatman foils the kidnappings and heads for the Penguin's lair. The Penguin attempts to have his army of penguins bomb the city and kill everyone in Gotham, though Batman and his butler, Alfred, jam the signal and order the penguins to head back to the sewer. Batman arrives and confronts the Penguin. In the ensuing fight, the Penguin falls through a window into the sewer's toxic water. Shreck escapes but is confronted by Catwoman, who intends to kill him. Batman pleads for Kyle to stop, unmasking himself in the process. Shreck draws a gun and shoots Wayne, and then shoots Kyle multiple times, but she survives and electrocutes herself and Shreck with a stun gun. Wayne, who was wearing body armour, finds Shreck's remains but Kyle is nowhere to be found. The Penguin emerges from the water, but eventually dies from his injuries and from the toxic sewage, and his penguin family lay his body to rest in the water. In the aftermath, as Alfred drives him home, Wayne sees Kyle's silhouette in an alley but only finds her cat, who he decides to take home with him. The Bat-Signal appears in the sky as Catwoman, who survived, watches.\n\n==Cast==\n{{redirect-distinguish|Max Shreck|Max Schreck}}\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:                                            The protector of [[Gotham City]] and the Caped Crusader.

They spent $250,000 storing the sets from the first film. [[Tim Burton]] originally did not want to direct another film in the franchise. \"I will return if the sequel offers something new and exciting\", he said in 1989. \"Otherwise it's a most-dumbfounded idea.\"<ref>Alan Jones (November 1989). \"Batman in Production\", ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', pp. 75\u201488. Retrieved August 14, 2008.</ref> Burton decided to direct ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]].

It is the fourth and final installment of [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Batman (1989 film series)|initial ''Batman'' film series]]. The film was directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] and written by [[Akiva Goldsman]]. It stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[George Clooney]], [[Chris O'Donnell]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], and [[Uma Thurman]]. ''Batman & Robin'' tells the story of the titular characters as they attempt to prevent [[Mr. Freeze]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] from freezing all mankind to death and repopulating the earth with mutant plants, while at the same time struggling to keep their partnership together. It is also to date the only live-action film appearance of [[Batgirl]], who helps the title characters fight the villains.\n\nWarner Bros. fast-tracked development for ''Batman & Robin'' following the box office success of the previous film, ''[[Batman Forever]]''. Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the storyline during pre-production on ''[[A Time to Kill (1996 film)|A Time to Kill]]'', while [[Val Kilmer]] decided not to reprise the role over scheduling conflicts with ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]''.

Mr. Freeze was originally Dr. Victor Fries, a doctor working to develop a cure for MacGregor's syndrome to heal his terminally ill [[Nora Fries|wife]]. Fries was forced to wear a cryogenic suit powered by diamonds after becoming unable to live at normal temperatures following a lab accident.\n\nAt a [[Wayne Enterprises]] lab in Brazil, the botanist [[Dr. Pamela Isley]] is working under the deranged [[Dr. Jason Woodrue]], experimenting with the Venom drug. She witnesses Woodrue use the formula to turn the violent, but diminutive, convicted serial murderer Antonio Diego into a hulking monstrosity dubbed \"[[Bane (comics)|Bane]]\". Woodrue and Isley argue over the use of the drug which ends when Woodrue attempts to kill her by overturning a shelf of various toxins. Despite Woodrue's efforts, she is resurrected, transforming into the beautiful and seductive [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] before exacting revenge; she kills Woodrue with her poisonous kiss, and sets fire to the lab, leaving it to burn down while she escapes with Bane. She finds that [[Wayne Enterprises]] funded Woodrue, thus she appropriates Bane as a muscle-bound thug, taking him with her to [[Gotham City]]. Meanwhile, [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s niece, Barbara Wilson, makes a surprise visit and is invited by Bruce Wayne to stay at [[Wayne Manor]] until she goes back to school.\n\nWayne Enterprises presents a new telescope for Gotham Observatory at a press conference interrupted by Isley. She proposes a project that could help the environment, but Bruce declines her offer, which would kill millions of people. That night, a charity event is held by [[Wayne Enterprises]] with special guests, Batman and Robin, and she decides to use her abilities to seduce them. Mr. Freeze crashes the party and steals a diamond from the event. Although he is captured by Batman and detained in [[Arkham Asylum]], he eventually [[Prison escape|escape]]s with the help of Poison Ivy and Bane. Meanwhile, Dick discovers that Barbara has participated in drag races to raise money for Alfred, who is dying of MacGregor's syndrome.\n\nBatman and Robin begin to have crime fighting relationship problems because of Ivy's seductive ability with Robin, but Bruce eventually convinces Dick to trust him. Poison Ivy is then able to contact Robin once more; she kisses him but fails to kill him due to Robin wearing rubber lips. Meanwhile, Barbara discovers the [[Batcave]], where an AI version of Alfred reveals he has made Barbara her own suit. Barbara dons the suit and becomes [[Batgirl]]. Ivy captures Robin, but he gets rescued by Batman, and Batgirl arrives and subdues Ivy to get eaten by her throne plant, before revealing her identity to the pair.\n\nBatman, Robin and Batgirl decide to go after Mr. Freeze together. By the time they get to the observatory where Mr. Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Batgirl and Robin are attacked by Bane, but they eventually defeat him by kicking apart his venom tubes, stopping the flow of venom to his body. Bane collapses before transforming back to his original diminutive size of Antonio Diego and is left helpless on the ground.\n\nMeanwhile Batman and Mr. Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Mr. Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to unfreeze Gotham, and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Poison Ivy during her fight with Batgirl, who had informed the latter that she killed Mr. Freeze's wife. However, Batman informs Mr. Freeze that she is still alive, having been restored by them{{clarify|date=January 2018}} in cryogenic slumber before being moved to [[Arkham Asylum]], waiting for Mr. Freeze to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Mr. Freeze for the cure Mr. Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred, and Mr. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him the medicine he had developed.\n\nMr. Freeze is then detained in Arkham Asylum. Poison Ivy is also imprisoned in Arkham Asylum with a vengeful Mr. Freeze as her cellmate and he plans to get revenge on Poison Ivy for what she did to his wife. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Ourgovernor.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Mr. Freeze]]\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as [[Mr. Freeze|Dr. Victor Fries/Mr. Freeze]] <br> A [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[molecular biology|molecular biologist]] and two-time [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[Decathlon|decathlete]] who suffers a terrible accident while trying to cryogenically  preserve his terminally ill wife.

It is the third installment of the [[Batman in film|initial ''Batman'' film series]], with [[Val Kilmer]] replacing [[Michael Keaton]] as Bruce Wayne/Batman. The film also stars [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Nicole Kidman]], and [[Chris O'Donnell]]. The plot focuses on Batman trying to stop [[Two-Face]] (Jones) and the [[Riddler]] (Carrey) in their villainous scheme to extract confidential information from all the minds in [[Gotham City]] and use it to learn Batman's identity and bring the city under their control. He gains allegiance from a love interest\u2014psychiatrist [[List of Batman supporting characters|Dr. Chase Meridian]] (Kidman) and a young, orphaned circus acrobat named [[Dick Grayson]] (O'Donnell), who becomes his sidekick [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].\n\n''Batman Forever''{{'}}s tone is significantly different from the previous installments, becoming more family-friendly since [[Warner Bros.]] believed that the previous ''Batman'' film, ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), failed to outgross its predecessor due to parent complaints about the film's violence and dark overtones. Schumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic book of the [[Dick Sprang]] era, as well as the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s television series]]. After Keaton chose not to reprise his role, [[William Baldwin]] and [[Ethan Hawke]] were considered as a replacement before Kilmer joined the cast.\n\nThe film was released on June 16, 1995, receiving mixed reviews, with criticism towards Jones' and Carry's performances as Two-Face and the Riddler, but was a financial success. ''Batman Forever'' grossed over $336 million worldwide and became the sixth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1995. The film was followed by ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' in 1997, with Schumacher returning as the director and [[George Clooney]] replacing Kilmer as Batman.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn [[Gotham City]], the crime fighter [[Batman]] defuses a hostage situation caused by a criminal known as [[Two-Face]], the alter ego of the former [[district attorney]] Harvey Dent, but Two-Face escapes and remains at large. Edward Nygma, a researcher at [[Wayne Enterprises]] who idolizes Bruce Wayne, has developed a device that can beam television into a person's brain. Bruce offers to let Nygma come up with schematics for the device and set up a meeting with his assistant. However, after Nygma demands an answer from him immediately, Bruce rejects the invention, believing it to be too close to mind manipulation. After killing his supervisor and staging it as a [[suicide]], Nygma resigns and begins sending Bruce riddles, seeking retaliation against him.\n\nBruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is obsessed with Batman, and invites her to come with him to a circus event. After a performance from the circus performers, The Flying Graysons, Two-Face arrives and threatens to blow up the circus unless Batman comes forward and surrenders his life to him. The Flying Graysons attempt to stop Two-Face, but most of them get killed as a result. Only Dick Grayson, the youngest member, survives as he climbs to the roof and throws Two-Face's bomb into a river.\n\nBruce invites the orphaned Dick to stay at [[Wayne Manor]]. Dick, still troubled by the murder of his family, intends to kill Two-Face and avenge his family. When he discovers that Bruce is Batman, he demands that Bruce help him find Two-Face so that he can kill him, but Bruce refuses. Meanwhile, Nygma, inspired and delighted by watching Two-Face's raid at the circus, turns himself into a criminal called the [[Riddler]] and forms an alliance with Two-Face. The two steal capital in order to mass-produce Nygma's brainwave device so that Riddler can use it to learn Batman's secret identity.\n\nAt Nygma's business party, Nygma discovers Bruce's alter ego using the brainwave device. Two-Face arrives and crashes the party. He nearly kills Batman, but Dick manages to save him. Meanwhile, Chase has fallen in love with Bruce, which surpasses her obsession with Batman. Bruce decides to stop being Batman in order to have a normal life with Chase, and to prevent Dick from murdering Two-Face. Dick runs away while Bruce and Chase have dinner together in the manor, where Bruce reveals his secret identity to her. The Riddler and Two-Face arrive and attack Wayne Manor; in the process, the Riddler blows up the [[Batcave]]. The criminals kidnap Chase after Two-Face shoots Bruce, and the Riddler leaves him another riddle.\n\nUsing the riddles, Bruce and his butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]], deduce the Riddler's secret identity. Chase is imprisoned by the Riddler and Two-Face in their hideout. Dick returns and becomes Batman's sidekick, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Batman and Robin head to Riddler and Two-Face's lair, Claw Island, where they are separated. Robin encounters Two-Face and nearly kills him, but chooses to spare his life and is captured. The Riddler gives Batman a chance to save only one hostage, but Batman destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device, causing the Riddler to suffer a mental breakdown and allowing Batman to rescue Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with the flip of a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death, avenging Robin's family.\n\nThe Riddler is taken to [[Arkham Asylum]] and imprisoned, but he claims he knows who Batman is. Chase is asked to consult on the case, but Nygma says that ''he'' himself is Batman, due to his damaged memories. Chase meets Bruce outside and tells him that his secret is safe before parting ways. Bruce resumes his crusade as Batman with Robin as his partner to protect Gotham from crime.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne/Batman]]: After coming across the journal of his father, he starts questioning his act of vengeance.

Only five of the songs on the soundtrack are actually featured in the movie. Hit singles from the soundtrack include \"[[Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me]]\" by [[U2]] and \"[[Kiss from a Rose]]\" by [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], both of which were nominated for MTV Movie Awards. \"Kiss from a Rose\" (whose video was also directed by Joel Schumacher) reached No. 1 in the U.S. charts as well. The soundtrack itself, featuring additional songs by [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] (both songs also included in the film), [[Method Man]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Michael Hutchence]] (of [[INXS]]), [[PJ Harvey]], and [[Massive Attack]], was an attempt to (in producer Peter MacGregor-Scott's words) make the film more \"pop\".\n\n==Deleted scenes==\n''Batman Forever'' went through a few major edits before its release.

There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the film's 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous ''Batman'' films were given special-edition DVD releases on the same day as the ''[[Batman Begins]]'' DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, although some of the following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/opinion_scissorpuppy_forever.html | title = Batman Forever \u2013 What Could Be: A Guide to the Batman Forever Cutting Room Floor | work = Batman-On-Film.com | accessdate = December 18, 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130702174008/http://www.batman-on-film.com/opinion_scissorpuppy_forever.html | archivedate = July 2, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere was an undercurrent theme involving Bruce having repressed memories of an aspect of his parents' death that he hadn't faced which was finding his father's diary on the night of his parents' wake and reading that Bruce insisted his parents go to the theater so he could watch one of the shows, meaning the reason he became Batman was out of the guilt that he was responsible for their deaths.\n\nMany scenes were filmed but deleted from the film; other scenes had footage removed. These included:\n\n* The escape of Two-Face from Arkham Asylum. [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] had another scene filmed here in the role of Doctor Burton, but his role was reduced in the final film. He discovers Two-Face's escape, encountering his psychologist hanged in Two-Face's cell with \"The Bat Must Die\" written in blood on the wall. This was supposed to be the film's opening scene, but producers decided this was far too dark for a family audience.\n* When Two-Face addresses the crowd from the helicopter in the opening action scene, the speech was truncated and several lines that appeared in the Theatrical Trailer were removed, including the line \"If the Bat wants to play, we'll play!\"\n* There was a sequence that contained an extended fight scene between Two-Face and Batman, where they both struggle for control of the helicopter. In this scene, Two-Face accuses Batman of being \"a killer too\"(a continuity reference to the previous Burton films). Two-face then manages to escape by the parachute, after Batman realizes he has locked the steering wheel into position. This sequence is included in rough form on the special-edition DVD.\n* A scene right before Edward Nygma arrived at Wayne Manor. It featured Bruce Wayne watching a local Gotham talk show with Chase Meridian as a guest, talking about Batman.\n* One scene right before Riddler and Two-face team up featured a little conversation with Dick and Bruce in the gym of the manor. This would explain why Dick suddenly has martial arts training. This scene appears in a rough edit on the special-edition DVD.\n* The scene where the Riddler fails to punch a security guard out. The guard is then brutally beaten by the Riddler using his cane. \n* One sequence came directly after the casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He shows up at the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the special-edition DVD.\n* The construction of NygmaTech was after Batman solves the third riddle and was more in-depth. There were scenes shot that appear in publicity stills of Edward Nygma with a hard hat helping with the construction of his headquarters on Claw Island.\n* Sugar and Spice, played by [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Debi Mazar]], try out the Riddler's device during the montage when it goes on sale. They are seated with the Riddler and Two-Face on the couch where Chase is handcuffed later in the film. This scene appears in the comic adaptation but not in the final film.\n* There was originally a scene after the montage of Alfred and Bruce examining the NygmaTech \"Box\".\n* An extended scene established Bruce in the Batcave shortly after having discussed with Dick then that this would have saved his life after the battle with Two-Face in the subway system under construction. In this scene he is appreciated as the GNN news (Bruce watching in the Batcomputer) attacking Batman and Two-Face after the battle in the Subway and after that Bruce talking to Alfred turns into the dilemma of continuing to be Batman and try a normal life with Chase. Like the deleted Helicopter fight sequence, this scene also makes reference to Batman himself being \"a killer\", and in the original production screenplay, this scene was to contain footage from ''[[Batman Returns]]'', specifically taken from the rooftop fight scene with Catwoman. This would explain why in the theatrical version Bruce turns off all the systems in the Batcave telling Dick he gives up being Batman. This scene appears in a rough form on the special-edition DVD.\n* Another scene in the Wayne Manor raid sequence was longer, featuring Bruce and Chase fighting Two-Face and his thugs.\n* The scene involving Chase Meridian on the couch originally included a longer ending where the Riddler injects her with a green sleeping agent so he can easily place her in the small tube with the trap door.\n* Another deleted scene involved Bruce waking up after being shot in the head by Two-Face, temporarily forgetting his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the [[Batmobile]] was, and Alfred says, \"Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave.\" The platform then rotates downward to another level where the [[sonar]]-modification equipment is kept, from the special [[Batsuit]] to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the giant bat that inspired him to become Batman. Inside he finds his father's red diary which he had dropped when he first fell into the Batcave after his parents death. He reads the entry about him insisting his parents take him to the theater to see a show the same night they were killed. He realizes he had misread it, and his father had written 'even though Bruce insists, we wanted to see Zorro so his show will have to wait until next week'. Bruce realizes his parents death was not his fault after all. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms to match the wing anatomy of the bat and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter [[Akiva Goldsman]] admitted the scene was very theatrical on the special-edition DVD and felt it would have made a difference to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by [[Rick Baker]], who was in charge of the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special-edition DVD.\n* The fight scene between Two-Face and Robin on Claw Island was originally longer.\n* The original ending was similar in style to the previous Batman films, which had involved a scene with Alfred in the limousine, the camera tracking upward through the Gotham cityscape, followed by a rooftop shot involving a silhouetted hero (Batman in the original, Catwoman in ''[[Batman Returns]]'') facing the Bat Signal. When Alfred drives Doctor Chase Meridian back to Gotham she asks him \"Does it ever end, Alfred?\" Alfred replies, \"No, Doctor Meridian, not in this lifetime...\" The [[Bat-Signal]] shines on the night sky and Batman is standing on a pillar looking ahead. Robin then comes into shot and joins his new partner. They both leap off the pillar, towards the camera. A rough edit of the first half of the scene appears on the special-edition DVD, but not in its entirety.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Batman Forever'' opened in 2,842 theaters in the United States on June 16, 1995, making $52.8 million in its opening weekend,<ref name=\"Box\">{{cite web |title=Batman Forever (1995) |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batmanforever.htm |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216144714/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batmanforever.htm |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}</ref> breaking [[Jurassic Park (film)|''Jurassic Park'']]'s record for highest opening-weekend gross of all time (it was surpassed two years later by ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]''{{'}}s $72.1 million).<ref name=\"dom\">{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=releasedate&view=opening&yr=1995&p=.htm | title = 1995 Domestic Grosses | publisher = Box Office Mojo | accessdate = August 16, 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130523024352/http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=releasedate&view=opening&yr=1995&p=.htm | archivedate = May 23, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The film went on to gross $184 million in North America, and $152.5 million in other countries, totaling $336.53 million.

He was created by artist [[Bob Kane]] and writer [[Bill Finger]] to capitalize on the success of DC's other superhero [[Superman]] and was inspired by characters from [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] stories, such as [[the Shadow]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Batman - The Complete History: The Life and Times of the Dark Knight|author=Les Daniels|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Batman_The_Complete_History.html?id=73wknu2cVIkC|pages=18\u201320}}</ref><ref>Boichel, Bill. \"Batman: Commodity as Myth.\" ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''.

In the story, a young Bruce witnesses the murder of his parents [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne|Martha]] at the hands of a mugger. Bruce vows to avenge his parents' deaths by fighting crime; he takes the persona of Batman after a [[bat]] flies through his window one night. For the story, Finger lifted elements from tales published in ''[[Popular Detective]]'' and ''[[The Phantom]]'', while Kane traced artwork of [[Tarzan]] and from ''[[Junior G-Men]]''.<ref name=\"nerd\">{{cite book|last1=Weldon|first1=Glen|title=The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture|date=2016|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-4767-5669-1|url=https://www.amazon.com/Caped-Crusade-Batman-Rise-Culture/dp/1476756694|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the years afterward, much of DC's continuity became convoluted and contradictory. Examples of this were present in Batman's origin: in a 1948 story, Finger gave the mugger a name ([[Joe Chill]]), and in 1956 wrote that he killed Bruce's parents on behalf of the mob. Finger also went on to suggest that the Batman persona was inspired by a bat costume Thomas wore to a [[masquerade ball]]. Other stories depicted Bruce traveling across the world to learn the skills he would need as Batman.<ref name=\"nerd\"/> In an effort to resolve continuity errors like these in the [[DC Universe]], [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George P\u00e9rez]] produced the 12-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.<ref name=\"backissue30\">{{cite journal|last1=Greeberger|first1=Robert|title=Crisis at 30: A Look Back at the Most Influential Crossover in Comics History|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|date=August 2015|issue=82}}</ref> Wolfman's plans for the DC Universe after ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' included relaunching every DC comic with a new first issue.<ref name=\"Slugfest152\">{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Reed |date=October 2017 |title=Slugfest |location= [[New York City]]|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=152 |isbn=0306825473 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Slugfest.html?id=hoyYDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nDuring the production of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] became the writer of [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''.<ref name=\"nerd\"/> Miller had originally been the series' [[penciller]],<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 189|isbn =978-0-7566-4123-8|quote= In this issue the great longtime ''Daredevil'' artist Gene Colan was succeeded by a new penciller who would become a star himself: Frank Miller.}}</ref> but editor [[Dennis O'Neil]] soon made him the series' writer.<ref name=\"O'NeilInt\">{{cite web | url = http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/ONeil | title = Interview with Dennis O'Neil|first= Kuljit|last= Mithra|date= February 1998 | publisher =  ManWithoutFear.com |accessdate= May 10, 2013 | archivedate= March 21, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130321185605/http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/ONeil}}</ref> Sales rose dramatically after Miller began to write.

Reflecting on poor sales of ''Batman'', O'Neil caught Miller one day while on a walk in [[Los Angeles]] and convinced him and Mazzucchelli to serialize the story in the ongoing series.<ref name=\"ONeil13th\">{{cite web|last1=Greenfield|first1=Dan|title=The DENNY O\u2019NEIL INTERVIEWS \u2014 Batman: Year One|url=https://13thdimension.com/the-denny-oneil-interviews-batman-year-one/|website=13th Dimension|accessdate=May 20, 2018|date=September 22, 2014}}</ref> Miller was initially reluctant; he felt this would be hard because he had to ensure the story stayed canonical to the DC Universe, something he did not have to worry about when writing ''The Dark Knight Returns''. In addition, Miller's pacing would have to be altered because of ongoing series' relatively small page counts. O'Neil reasoned that ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' had completely remade the DC Universe, so Miller would be able to have the same creative freedom that ''The Dark Knight Returns'' provided.<ref name=\"nerd\"/> He also reassured Miller that he and Mazzucchelli \"weren\u2019t going to lose anything\" by serializing it.<ref name=\"ONeil13th\"/>\n\nMiller has said he kept Kane and Finger's basic story for \"Year One\" but expanded it.<ref name=\"NPRTalk\">{{cite web|title='Batman' Author Frank Miller|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4704766|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018|date=June 15, 2005}}</ref> In writing the story, Miller looked for parts of Batman's origin that were never explored. He left the core elements, such as the murder of Bruce's parents, intact, but reduced them to brief [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. Bruce's globe-trotting adventures was something Miller removed, as he found uninteresting. Rather than portraying Batman as a larger-than-life icon as he had in ''The Dark Knight Returns'', Miller chose to characterize \"Year One\"'s Batman as an average, inexperienced man trying to make a change in society because Miller believed a superhero is least interesting when most effective. Examples of this include Batman underestimating his opponents, getting shot by police, and his costume being too big. The story's violence was kept street-level and gritty, emphasizing [[Noir fiction|noir]] and realism.<ref name=\"nerd\"/>\n\nIn illustrating, Mazzucchelli sought to make \"Year One\" look grimy, dark, and muted. His interpretation of [[Gotham City]] was designed to symbolize corruption, featuring muddy colors that gave the impression of the city being dirty and needing a hero. The newsprint paper used in ''Batman'' was unable to reproduce the bright coloring and visual effects of ''The Dark Knight Returns'', so Mazzucchelli took on \"Year One\" with a more grounded and darker approach.<ref name=\"visual\"/>\n\n===Publication===\nIn accordance with Wolfman's plans,<ref name=\"Slugfest152\"/> O'Neil initially saw \"Year One\" as the start of the second volume of ''Batman'' and expected the first part to be its first issue. However, Miller rejected this idea. He explained: \"I don't need to slash through continuity with as sharp a blade as I thought. Doing the ''Dark Knight'' has shown me there's been enough good material... I didn't feel that fleshing out an unknown part of Batman's history justified wiping out 50 years of [adventures].\"<ref name=\"visual\"/> Thus, the four \"Year One\" issues bear no continuity to past issues of ''Batman''.<ref name=\"visual\">{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 227 |quote =  Melding Miller's noir sensibilities, realistic characterization, and gritty action with Mazzucchelli's brilliant iconic imagery, \"Year One\" thrilled readers and critics alike...as well as being one of the influences for the 2005 film ''Batman Begins''.}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|| '''Title'''\n|| '''Issue'''\n|| '''Cover date'''\n|-\n| \"'''Chapter One: Who I Am - How I Come to Be'''\"\n| ''Batman'' #404\n| February 1987\n|-\n| \"'''Chapter Two: War is Declared'''\"\n| ''Batman'' #405\n| March 1987\n|-\n| \"'''Chapter Three: Black Dawn'''\"\n| ''Batman'' #406\n| April 1987\n|-\n| \"'''Chapter Four: Friend in Need'''\"\n| ''Batman'' #407\n| May 1987\n|}\n\n===Collected editions===\nOne of the earliest collections of \"Year One\" was released in ''The Complete Frank Miller Batman'', published by [[Longmeadow Press]] in 1989.<ref name=\"IGN2012\"/> A dedicated collected edition, ''Batman: Year One'', was published as a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] in October 1997 ({{isbn|0-930289-33-1}}).

Bruce Wayne returns home to [[Gotham City]] at the age of twenty-five from training abroad in martial arts, man-hunting, and science for the past 12 years, and James Gordon moves to Gotham City with his wife, Barbara, after a transfer from [[Chicago]]. Both are swiftly acquainted with the corruption and violence of Gotham City, with Gordon witnessing his partner [[Arnold John Flass|Detective Arnold John Flass]] assaulting an African-American teen for fun.\n\nAfter refusing a proposition from a teenage prostitute [[Holly Robinson (fictional character)|Holly Robinson]], Bruce is reluctantly drawn into a brawl with her violent pimp and is attacked by several prostitutes, including [[dominatrix]] [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]]. Two police officers shoot and take him in their squad car, but a dazed and bleeding Bruce breaks his handcuffs and causes a crash, dragging the police to a safe distance before fleeing. He reaches [[Wayne Manor]] barely alive and sits before his father\u2019s bust, requesting guidance in his war on crime. A bat crashes through a window and settles on the bust, giving him the inspiration to become the Batman.\n\nGordon soon works to rid corruption from the force, but, on orders from [[Gillian B. Loeb|Commissioner Gillian Loeb]], several officers attack him, including Flass, who personally threatens Gordon\u2019s pregnant wife. In revenge, the recovering Gordon tracks Flass down, beats him, and leaves him naked and handcuffed in the snow.\n\nAs Gordon becomes a minor celebrity for several brave acts, Batman strikes for the first time, attacking a group of thieves. Batman soon works up the ladder, even attacking Flass while the latter was accepting a drug dealer\u2019s bribe. After Batman interrupts a dinner party attended by many of Gotham's corrupt politicians and crime bosses to announce his intention to bring them to justice, including [[Carmine Falcone|Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone]], Loeb orders Gordon to bring him in by any means necessary.\n\nAs Gordon tries in vain to catch him, Batman attacks Falcone, stripping him naked and tying him up in his bed and dumping his car in the river, infuriating the mob boss. Assistant [[District Attorney]] [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] becomes Batman\u2019s first ally, while [[Sarah Essen Gordon|Detective Sarah Essen]] and Gordon witness Batman save an old woman from a runaway truck, after Essen suggested Bruce Wayne as a Batman suspect. Essen holds Batman at gunpoint while Gordon is momentarily dazed, but Batman disarms her and flees to an abandoned building.\n\nClaiming the building has been scheduled for demolition, Loeb orders a bomb to be dropped on it, forcing Batman into the fortified basement, where he abandons his belt as it catches fire. A [[SWAT]] team led by trigger-happy officer Branden is sent in and attempts to trap Batman in the basement. After tranquilizing Branden, Batman dodges bullets as Branden's team opens fire on him, barely managing to survive after two bullet wounds. Enraged as the team\u2019s carelessly fired bullets injure several people outside, Batman beats the team into submission and, after using a device to attract the bats of his cave to him, he flees amid the chaos. After witnessing him in action, Selina Kyle dons a costume of her own to begin a life of crime.\n\nGordon has a brief affair with Essen, while Batman intimidates a mob drug dealer for information. The dealer comes to Gordon to testify against Flass, who is brought up on charges. Upset with Gordon's exploits, Loeb blackmails Gordon against pressing charges with proof of his affair. After bringing Barbara with him to interview Bruce Wayne, investigating his connection to Batman, Gordon confesses the affair to her.\n\nBatman sneaks into Falcone\u2019s manor, overhearing a plan against Gordon, but is interrupted when Selina Kyle, hoping to build a reputation after her robberies were pinned on Batman, attacks Falcone and his bodyguards, aided from afar by Batman. Identifying Falcone\u2019s plan as the morning comes, the uncostumed Bruce leaves to help.\n\nWhile leaving home, Gordon spots a motorcyclist enter his garage. Suspicious, Gordon enters to see Johnny Vitti, Falcone's nephew, and his thugs holding his family hostage. Gordon decisively shoots the thugs and chases Vitti, who has fled with the baby. The mysterious motorcyclist, now revealed to the reader as Bruce Wayne, rushes out to chase Vitti. Gordon blows out Vitti's car tire on a bridge and the two fight hand-to-hand, with Gordon losing his glasses, before Vitti and James Gordon Jr. fall over the side. Bruce leaps over the railing and saves the baby. Gordon realizes that he is standing before an unmasked Batman, but says that he is \"practically blind without [his] glasses,\" and lets Bruce go.\n\nIn the final scenes of the comic, Flass turns on Loeb, supplying Dent with evidence and testimony, and Loeb resigns. Gordon is promoted to captain and stands on the rooftop waiting to meet Batman to discuss somebody called [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], who is plotting to poison the reservoir.\n\n==Reception==\nDC's post-''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' revamp was a major success, raising sales 22% in the first year, and DC beat Marvel in [[direct market]] sales for the first time in August and September 1987.<ref name=\"Slugfest157\">{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Reed |date=October 2017 |title=Slugfest |location= [[New York City]]|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=157 |isbn=0306825473 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Slugfest.html?id=hoyYDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> The four \"Year One\" issues were no exception to this. Two years before the relaunch, ''Batman'' had all-time low sales of 75,000 copies per month; \"Year One\" sold an average of 193,000 copies an issue, numbers not seen since the early 1970s.

''Year One'' was followed by ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'', but the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'' crossover erased ''Year Two'' from continuity. In another continuity re-arrangement, ''Catwoman: Year One'' (''Catwoman Annual'' #2, 1995) posited that Selina Kyle had not actually been a prostitute, but, rather, a thief posing as one in order to commit crimes.\n\nLaunched in 1989, following the success of the film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', the title ''[[Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' examines crime-fighting exploits primarily, not exclusively, from the first four to five years of Batman's career. This title rotated in creative teams and time placement, but several stories directly relate to the events of ''Year One'', especially the first arc \"Batman: Shaman\". In 1998, [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]] created ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'' and ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', two 13-issue maxiseries that recounted Batman's early years as a crime-fighter following the events of Miller's original story and retold the origins of [[Two-Face]] and [[Dick Grayson]]. The ''Year One'' story was continued in the 2005 graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Man Who Laughs]]'', following up on Gordon informing Batman about the Joker, and thus recounting their first official encounter. Two other stories, ''[[Batman and the Monster Men]]'' and ''[[Batman and the Mad Monk]]'' tie into the same time period of Batman's career, filling in the gap between Year One and the Man Who Laughs. The comics ''[[Robin: Year One]]'' and ''[[Batgirl: Year One]]'' describe his sidekicks' origin stories.\n\n==Adaptations==\nAfter the critical failure of ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', several attempts were made to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] the [[Batman in film|Batman film franchise]] with an adaptation of \"Year One\".

It generally involves text containing different types of [[alphabet]]s, but may also refer to [[boustrophedon]], which is changing text directionality in each row.\n\nSome [[writing system]]s of the world, including the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] scripts or derived systems such as the [[Persian alphabet|Persian]], [[Urdu alphabet|Urdu]], and [[Yiddish orthography|Yiddish]] scripts, are written in a form known as right-to-left (RTL), in which writing begins at the right-hand side of a page and concludes at the left-hand side. This is different from the left-to-right (LTR) direction used by the dominant Latin script. When LTR text is mixed with RTL in the same paragraph, each type of text is written in its own direction, which is known as ''bi-directional text''. This can get rather complex when multiple levels of quotation are used.\n\nMany computer programs fail to display bi-directional text correctly.\nFor example, the Hebrew name Sarah <span lang=\"he\">(\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4)</span> is spelled: sin <span lang=\"he\">(\u05e9)</span> (which appears rightmost), then resh <span lang=\"he\">(\u05e8)</span>, and finally heh <span lang=\"he\">(\u05d4)</span> (which should appear leftmost).\n\n''Note: Some [[web browser]]s may display the Hebrew text in this article in the opposite direction.''\n\n== Bidirectional script support ==\nBidirectional script support is the capability of a [[computer]] system to correctly display bi-directional text. The term is often shortened to \"BiDi\" or \"bidi\".\n\nEarly computer installations were designed only to support a single [[writing system]], typically for left-to-right scripts based on the [[Latin alphabet]] only.  Adding new [[character set]]s and [[character encoding]]s enabled a number of other left-to-right scripts to be supported, but did not easily support right-to-left scripts such as [[Arabic script|Arabic]] or [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and mixing the two was not practical. Right-to-left scripts were introduced through encodings like [[ISO/IEC 8859-6]] and [[ISO/IEC 8859-8]], storing the letters (usually) in writing and reading order. It is possible to simply flip the left-to-right display order to a right-to-left display order, but doing this sacrifices the ability to correctly display left-to-right scripts. With bidirectional script support, it is possible to mix scripts from different scripts on the same page, regardless of writing direction.\n\nIn particular, the [[Unicode]] standard provides foundations for complete BiDi support, with detailed rules as to how mixtures of left-to-right and right-to-left scripts are to be encoded and displayed.\n\n== Unicode bidi support ==\n{{ref label|Bidi_UAX9|1}}\nThe Unicode standard calls for characters to be ordered 'logically', i.e. in the sequence they are intended to be interpreted, as opposed to 'visually', the sequence they appear. This distinction is relevant for bidi support because at any bidi transition, the visual presentation ceases to be the 'logical' one. Thus, in order to offer bidi support, Unicode prescribes an algorithm for how to convert the logical sequence of characters into the correct visual presentation. For this purpose, the Unicode encoding standard divides all its characters into one of four types: 'strong', 'weak', 'neutral', and 'explicit formatting'.\n\n=== Strong characters ===\nStrong characters are those with definite directionality. Examples of this type of character include most alphabetic characters, syllabic characters, Han ideographs, non-European or non-Arabic digits, and punctuation characters ''that are specific to only those scripts''.\n\n=== Weak characters ===\nWeak characters are those with vague directionality. Examples of this type of character include European digits,<!--Debian doesn't work this way: \"\u062d\u062c6341\" does not show the year as \"1436\"--> Eastern Arabic-Indic digits, arithmetic symbols, and currency symbols.\n\n==== Numbers ====\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Resolving_Weak_Types |title=UAX #9: Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm |publisher=Unicode.org |date=2018-05-09 |accessdate=2018-06-26}}</ref> Unless a directional override is present numbers are always encoded (and entered) big-endian, and the numerals rendered LTR. The weak directionality only applies to the placement of the number in its entirety.\n\n=== Neutral characters ===\nNeutral characters have directionality indeterminable without context. Examples include paragraph separators, tabs, and most other whitespace characters. Punctuation symbols that are common to many scripts, such as the colon, comma, full-stop, and the no-break-space also fall within this category.\n\n=== Explicit formatting ===\nExplicit formatting characters, also referred to as \"directional formatting characters\", are special Unicode sequences that direct the unicode algorithm to modify its default behavior. These characters are subdivided into \"marks\", \"embeddings\", \"isolates\", and \"overrides\". Their effects continue until the occurrence of either a paragraph separator, or a \"pop\" character.\n\n==== Marks ====\nIf a \"weak\" character is followed by another \"weak\" character, the algorithm will look at the first neighbouring \"strong\" character. Sometimes this leads to unintentional display errors. These errors are corrected or prevented with \"pseudo-strong\" characters. Such [[Unicode control characters]] are called ''marks''. The mark ({{unichar|200E|Left-to-right mark|note=LRM}} or {{unichar|200F|Right-to-left mark|note=RLM}}) is to be inserted into a location to make an enclosed weak character inherit its writing direction.\n\nFor example, to correctly display the {{unichar|2122|trade mark sign}} for an English name brand (LTR) in an Arabic (RTL) passage, an LRM mark is inserted after the trademark symbol if the symbol is not followed by LTR text (e.g. \"{{rtl-lang|ar|\u0642\u0631\u0623 Wikipedia\u2122 \u0637\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645.}}\"). If the LRM mark is not added, the weak character \u2122 will be neighbored by a strong LTR character and a strong RTL character. Hence, in an RTL context, it will be considered to be RTL, and displayed in an incorrect order (e.g. \"{{rtl-lang|ar|\u0642\u0631\u0623 Wikipedia\u2122 \u0637\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645.}}\").\n\n==== Embeddings ====\nThe \"embedding\" directional formatting characters are the classical Unicode method of explicit formatting, and as of Unicode 6.3, are being discouraged in favor of \"isolates\". An \"embedding\" signals that a piece of text is to be treated as directionally distinct. The text within the scope of the embedding formatting characters is not independent of the surrounding text. Also, characters within an embedding can affect the ordering of characters outside. Unicode 6.3 recognized that directional embeddings usually have too strong an effect on their surroundings and are thus unnecessarily difficult to use.\n\n==== Isolates ====\nThe \"isolate\" directional formatting characters signal that a piece of text is to be treated as directionally isolated from its surroundings. As of Unicode 6.3, these are the formatting characters that are being encouraged in new documents \u2013 once target platforms are known to support them. These formatting characters were introduced after it became apparent that directional embeddings usually have too strong an effect on their surroundings and are thus unnecessarily difficult to use. Unlike the legacy 'embedding' directional formatting characters, 'isolate' characters have no effect on the ordering of the text outside their scope. Isolates can be nested, and may be placed within embeddings and overrides.\n\n==== Overrides ====\nThe \"override\" directional formatting characters allow for special cases, such as for part numbers (e.g. to force a part number made of mixed English, digits and Hebrew letters to be written from right to left), and are recommended to be avoided wherever possible. As is true of the other directional formatting characters, \"overrides\" can be nested one inside another, and in embeddings and isolates.\n\n==== Pops ====\nThe \"pop\" directional formatting characters terminate the scope of the most recent \"embedding\", \"override\", or \"isolate\".\n\n=== Runs ===\nIn the algorithm, each sequence of concatenated strong characters is called a \"run\". A \"weak\" character that is located between two \"strong\" characters with the same orientation will inherit their orientation. A \"weak\" character that is located between two \"strong\" characters with a different writing direction, will inherit the main context's writing direction (in an LTR document the character will become LTR, in an RTL document, it will become RTL).\n\n=== Table of possible BiDi-types ===\n{{Bidi Class (Unicode)|state=expanded}}\n\n== Scripts using bi-directional text ==\n\n=== Egyptian hieroglyphs ===\n[[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphs]] can be written bi-directionally, where the signs had a distinct \"head\" that faced the beginning of a line and \"tail\" that faced the end.\n\n=== Chinese characters and other CJK scripts ===\n[[Chinese characters]] can be written in either direction as well as vertically (top to bottom then right to left), especially in signs (such as plaques), but the orientation of the individual characters is never changed. This can often be seen on tour buses in China, where the company name customarily runs from the front of the vehicle to its rear \u2014 that is, from right to left on the right side of the bus, and from left to right on the left side of the bus. English texts on the right side of the vehicle are also quite commonly written in reverse order. (See pictures of tour bus and post vehicle below.)\n\nLikewise, other [[CJK]] scripts made up of the same square characters, such as the [[Japanese writing system]] and [[Korean writing system]], can also be written in any direction, although left-to-right, top-to-bottom and top-to-bottom, right-to-left are most common.\n<gallery>\nImage:Yangzhou-tour-bus--right-side-3182.jpg|The right side (text runs from right to left)\nImage:Yangzhou-tour-bus--leftt-side-3184.jpg|The left side (text runs from left to right)\nImage:Hainan Airlines - Boeing 737-86N.jpg| On the right side of this [[Hainan Airlines]] aircraft, the text runs from right to left (\u202e\u6d77\u5357\u822a\u7a7a\u202c).\nImage:Hainan Airlines.JPG|The left side of this Hainan Airlines aircraft, however, shows the text running from left to right (\u6d77\u5357\u822a\u7a7a).\nFile:VM 5485 China Post Office car at Zhengzhou Train Station.jpg|A photo that shows text on both sides of a China Post vehicle\n</gallery>\n\n=== Boustrophedon ===\n[[Boustrophedon]] is a writing style found in ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] inscriptions and in [[Hungarian runes]]. This method of writing alternates direction, and usually reverses the individual characters, on each successive line.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Internationalization and localization]]\n* [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts]]\n* {{section link|Writing system|Directionality}}\n* [[Combining Cyrillic Millions]]\n* [[Transformation of text]]\n* [[Boustrophedon]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/ Unicode Standards Annex #9] The Bidirectional Algorithm\n* [http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech-bidi/ W3C guidelines on authoring techniques for bi-directional text] - includes examples and good explanations\n* [https://github.com/mta452/SheenBidi SheenBidi] A sophisticated implementation of Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm\n* [http://fribidi.org/ GNU FriBidi] A free implementation of the Unicode bidirectional algorithm\n* [http://www.icu-project.org/ ICU] [[International Components for Unicode]] contains an implementation of the bidirectional algorithm \u2014 along with other internationalization services\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20030604190424/http://crl.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/ucdata.html UCData: \"Pretty Good Bidi Algorithm Library\"] A small and fast bidirectional reordering algorithm that works pretty good, but not necessarily compliant to the Unicode algorithm\n* [http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/bidi-spec?action=show&redirect=Standards%2Fbidi-spec Bidirectional Scripts in Desktop Software] Working group for supporting BiDi in [[Free Software]].

The class was an evolutionary development from the earlier {{sclass-|James Madison|submarine|4}} of fleet ballistic missile submarine.  Having quieter machinery and other improvements, it is considered a separate class. A subset of this class is the re-engineered 640 class starting with {{USS|George C. Marshall| SSBN-654}} The primary difference was that they were built under the new SUBSAFE rules after the loss of the USS Thresher, earlier boats of the class had to be retrofitted to meet SUBSAFE requirements.  The ''Benjamin Franklin'' class, together with the {{sclass-|George Washington|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Ethan Allen|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Lafayette|submarine|5}}, and {{sclass-|James Madison|submarine|5}} classes, composed the \"[[41 for Freedom]]\" that was the Navy's primary contribution to the [[nuclear deterrent]] force through the late 1980s. This class and the ''James Madison'' class are combined with the ''Lafayette''s in some references.\n\n==Design==\n\nThe ''Benjamin Franklin''-class submarines were built with the [[Polaris missile|Polaris A-3]] [[ballistic missile]], and in the early 1970s were converted to carry the [[Poseidon missile|Poseidon C-3]] missile.  During the late 1970s and early 1980s, six boats were further modified to carry the [[Trident missile|Trident I (C-4)]] missile, along with six ''James Madison''-class boats. These were ''Benjamin Franklin'', ''Simon Bolivar'', ''George Bancroft'', ''Henry L. Stimson'', ''Francis Scott Key'', and ''Mariano G. Vallejo''.<ref name=\"Conways p612\"/>\n\nDue to the loss of {{USS|Thresher|SSN-593|6}} in April 1963, this class was designed to [[SUBSAFE]] standards and its equipment was similar to the {{sclass-|Sturgeon|submarine|0}} fast [[attack submarine]]s (SSNs). Previous US SSBNs except the ''George Washington'' class had equipment similar to the {{sclass-|Thresher|submarine|0}} SSNs.\n\nThis class can be distinguished by the fairwater planes' location halfway up the sail; the ''Lafayette''s and ''James Madison''s had the fairwater planes in the upper front portion of the sail.\n\nTwo submarines of this class were converted for delivery of up to 66 [[United States Navy SEALs|SEALs]] or other [[Special Operations Forces]] each. In the early 1990s, to make room for the {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|0}} ballistic missile submarines within the limits set by the [[SALT II]] strategic arms limitation treaty, the ballistic missile tubes of {{USS|Kamehameha|SSBN-642|2}} and {{USS|James K. Polk|SSBN-645|2}} were disabled. Those boats were redesignated [[special operations]] [[attack submarine]]s and given attack submarine (SSN) [[hull classification symbols]]. They were equipped with [[dry deck shelter]]s to accommodate [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle]]s or other equipment.<ref name=\"Conways p612\"/>\n\n==Fate==\nThe ''Benjamin Franklin''s were decommissioned between 1992 and 2002 due to a combination of [[SALT II]] treaty limitations as the {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|4}} SSBNs entered service, age, and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"Conways p612\"/> USS ''Kamehameha'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 2 April 2002, the last ship of the ''Benjamin Franklin'' class to be decommissioned.<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/08/08642.htm ''Kamehameha'' at NavSource.org]</ref>\n\nThe sail of ''George Bancroft'' is preserved at the [[Naval Submarine Base King's Bay]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

Their father, George McGhee, was a factory worker, known around University Avenue for playing guitar and singing. Brownie's uncle made him a guitar from a tin marshmallow box and a piece of board.<ref>Neely, Jack (1995). ''Knoxville's Secret History''. Scruffy City Publishing.</ref>\n\nMcGhee spent much of his youth immersed in music, singing with a local harmony group, the Golden Voices Gospel Quartet, and teaching himself to play guitar. He also played the five-string banjo and ukulele and studied piano.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\"/> Surgery funded by the [[March of Dimes]] enabled McGhee to walk.\n\nAt age 22, McGhee became a traveling musician, working in the [[Rabbit Foot Minstrels]] and befriending [[Blind Boy Fuller]], whose guitar playing influenced him greatly. After Fuller's death in 1941, [[J. B. Long]] of [[Columbia Records]] promoted McGhee as \"Blind Boy Fuller No. 2.\" By that time, McGhee was recording for Columbia's subsidiary [[Okeh Records]] in Chicago, but his real success came after he moved to New York in 1942, when he teamed up with [[Sonny Terry]], whom he had known since 1939, when Terry was Fuller's harmonica player. The pairing was an overnight success. They recorded and toured together until around 1980. As a duo, Terry and McGhee did most of their work from 1958 until 1980, spending 11 months of each year touring and recording dozens of albums.\n\nDespite their later fame as \"pure\" folk artists playing for white audiences, in the 1940s Terry and McGhee had attempted to be successful recording artists, fronting a [[jump blues]] combo with honking saxophone and rolling piano, variously calling themselves Brownie McGhee and his Jook House Rockers or Sonny Terry and his Buckshot Five, often with [[Champion Jack Dupree]] and [[Big Chief Ellis]]. They also appeared in the original Broadway productions of ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' and ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]''.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Browniemcghee.jpg|left|200px]] -->\nDuring the [[Roots revival|blues revival]] of the 1960s, Terry and McGhee were popular on the concert and music festival circuits, occasionally adding new material but usually remaining faithful to their roots and playing to the tastes of their audiences.\n\nLate in his life, McGhee appeared in small roles in films and on television. He and Terry appeared in the 1979 [[Steve Martin]] comedy ''[[The Jerk]]''. In 1987, McGhee gave a small but memorable performance as the ill-fated blues singer Toots Sweet in the supernatural thriller movie ''[[Angel Heart]].'' In his review of ''Angel Heart'', the critic [[Roger Ebert]] singled out McGhee for praise, declaring that he delivered a \"performance that proves [saxophonist] [[Dexter Gordon]] isn't the only old musician who can act.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870306/REVIEWS/703060301/1023 |title=Angel Heart |author=Ebert, Roger |date= March 6, 1987 |publisher= ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> McGhee appeared in the television series ''Family Ties'', in a 1988 episode entitled \"The Blues, Brother\", in which he played the fictional blues musician Eddie Dupre. He also appeared in the television series ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'', in a 1989 episode entitled \"The Blues Singer\".\n\n[[Happy Traum]], a former guitar student of McGhee's, edited a blues guitar instruction guide and songbook, ''Guitar Styles of Brownie McGhee'', published in 1971, in which McGhee, between lessons, talked about his life and the blues. The autobiographical section features McGhee talking about growing up, his musical beginnings, and a history of the blues from the 1930s onward.\n\nOne of McGhee's last concert appearances was at the 1995 [[Chicago Blues Festival]].<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\nMcGhee died of [[stomach cancer]] in February 1996 in [[Oakland, California]], at age 80.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Solo albums===\n* ''Traditional Blues, Vol. 1'' ([[Folkways Records]], 1951)\n* ''Brownie McGhee Blues'' (Folkways, 1955)\n* ''Brownie McGhee Sings the Blues'' (Folkways, 1959)\n* ''Traditional Blues, Vol. 2'' (Folkways, 1960)\n* ''Brownie's Blues'' (Original Blues Classics, 1962)\n* ''Blues Is Truth'' (Blues Alliance, 1976)\n* ''Facts of Life'' (Blues Rock'It, 1985)\n\n===Compilation===\n* ''The Folkways Years, 1945\u20131959'' (Smithsonian Folkways, 1991)\n\n===With Sonny Terry===\n* ''Brownie McGhee Blues'' (Folkways, 1955)\n* ''Washboard Band: Country Dance Music'' (Folkways, 1956)\n* ''Folk Songs of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee'' (Roulette, 1958)\n* ''Blues with Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee'' (Folkways, 1959)\n* ''Brownie McGhee & Sonny Terry at the 2nd Fret'' (Prestige, 1962)\n*''[[Sonny Is King]]'' (Bluesville, 1963)\n* ''[[Sonny & Brownie]]'' ([[A&M Records]], 1973)\n* ''Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry Sing'' ([[Smithsonian Folkways]], 1990)\n* \"Back Country Blues\" (Southern Routes, 2016)\n\n==See also==\n*[[American folk music]]\n*[[Woody Guthrie]]\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[List of folk musicians]]\n*[[List of people from Tennessee]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Britannica|354413}}\n*[http://www.sc.edu/csam/csamaudioarchive_brownie_mcghee.htm Center for Southern African American Music - Brownie McGhee]&nbsp;&mdash; McGhee bio and audio samples\n*{{IMDb name|0569185}}\n* [https://archive.org/details/caolaam_000051 Series of taped interviews with Brownie McGhee]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McGhee, Brownie}}\n[[Category:1915 births]]\n[[Category:1996 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Knoxville, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:African-American musicians]]\n[[Category:Piedmont blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]\n[[Category:East Coast blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Blues revival musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:Blues Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:American folk singers]]\n[[Category:National Heritage Fellowship winners]]\n[[Category:People from Kingsport, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Singers from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Jubilee Records artists]]\n[[Category:Savoy Records artists]]\n[[Category:Skiffle]]\n[[Category:Deaths from stomach cancer]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer in California]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:American male pianists]]\n[[Category:People with poliomyelitis]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Tennessee]]", "sha1": "qd1pr4fneold1pzwrvq69a8xy17rpc3"}}, {"title": "International Bureau of Weights and Measures", "ns": "0", "id": "4739", "revision": {"id": "862912829", "parentid": "860298661", "timestamp": "2018-10-07T14:30:58Z", "contributor": {"username": "Charles Inigo", "id": "30541281"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* See also */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use British English|date=September 2013}}\n{{Infobox organization\n|name           = International Bureau of Weights and Measures<br>{{lang-fr|'''Bureau international des poids et mesures'''}}\n|native_name = \u039c\u0395\u03a4\u03a1\u03a9 \u03a7\u03a1\u03a9 (\"Use the measure\"<ref>Pat Naughtin.

The final programme of work is determined by the CIPM in accordance with the dotation agreed by the CGPM. \n\nCurrently, main work of the BIPM include<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/bipm/|title=BIPM - BIPM work programme|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref>:\n\n* scientific and technical activities carried out in its four departments: chemistry, ionizing radiation, physical metrology, and time;\n* liaison and coordination work, including providing the secretariat for the CIPM Consultative Committees and some of their Working Groups and for the CIPM MRA, and providing institutional liaison with the other bodies supporting the international quality infrastructure and other international bodies;\n* capacity building and knowledge transfer programs that aim to increase the effectiveness within the world-wide metrology community of those Member State and Associates with emerging metrology systems;\n* a resource center providing database and publications for international metrology.\n\nThe BIPM has an important role in maintaining accurate worldwide time of day. It combines, analyses, and averages the official atomic time standards of member nations around the world to create a single, official [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/|title=BIPM Time Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)|publisher=BIPM|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe BIPM is also the keeper of the [[international prototype of the kilogram]].<ref name=IPK>{{cite web|title=International prototype of the kilogram|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/mass/prototype.html|publisher=BIPM|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Directors of the BIPM ==\n[[File:BIPM courtyard.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Pavillon de Breteuil]] in [[Saint-Cloud]], [[France]]]]\nSince its establishment, the directors of the BIPM have been:<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.bipm.org/en/bipm/sections/director/former_directors.html\n|title = Directors of the BIPM since 1875\n|year = 2011\n|publisher = Bureau International des Poids et Mesures\n|accessdate = 30 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|newspaper = QMT News\n|url = http://www.qmtmag.com/display_eds.cfm?edno=5190245\n|title = NPL Fellow, Dr Martin Milton, is new Director at foundation of world's measurement system\n|publisher = Quality Manufacturing Today\n|date = August 2012\n|accessdate = 30 September 2012}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"; border=\"5\" \n!

Archaeological studies have confirmed the presence of a Roman [[Castra|castrum]], a stronghold in [[Novempopulania]] at the end of the 4th century before the city was populated by the [[Vascones]].\n\nIn 1023 Bayonne was the capital of [[Labourd]] and, in the 12th century, extended to and beyond the Nive. At that time the first bridge was built over the Adour. The city came under the domination of the English in 1152 through the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]: it became militarily and, above all, commercially important thanks to maritime trade. It was separated from the Viscount of Labourd in 1177 by [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion Heart]]. In 1451 the city was taken by the Crown of France after the [[Hundred Years' War]]. The loss of trade with the English and the silting up of the river as well as the movement of the city towards the north weakened it. The district of Saint-Esprit developed anyway thanks to the arrival of a Jewish population fleeing the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. From this community Bayonne gained its reputation for chocolate. The course of the Adour was changed in 1578 under the direction of [[Louis de Foix]] and the river returned to its former mouth, returning business lost to Bayonne for over a hundred years. In the 17th century the city was fortified by [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]]. In 1814 Bayonne and its surroundings were the scene of fighting between the Napoleonic troops and the Spanish-Anglo-Portuguese coalition led by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]: the city then underwent its final [[Battle of Bayonne|siege]].\n\nIn 1951 the Lacq gas field was discovered whose extracted [[sulphur]] and associated oil are shipped from the port of Bayonne. During the second half of the 20th century many housing estates were built forming new districts on the periphery and the city was extended to form a conurbation with [[Anglet]] and [[Biarritz]]: this agglomeration became the heart of a vast Basque-Landes urban area.\n\nBayonne was, in 2014, a commune with over 45,000 inhabitants, the heart of the urban area of Bayonne and of the ''Agglomeration C\u00f4te Basque-Adour'' which includes [[Anglet]] and [[Biarritz]]. It is an important part of the Basque ''Bayonne-San Sebasti\u00e1n Eurocity'' and it plays the role of economic capital of the Adour basin. Modern industry\u2014metallurgy and chemicals\u2014are established to take advantage of procurement opportunities and sea shipments through the harbour. It is now mostly business services which today represent the largest source of employment. Bayonne is also a cultural capital, a city with strong Basque and Gascon influences and a rich historical past. Its heritage lies in its architecture, the diversity of collections in museums, its gastronomic specialties, and traditional events such as the famous [[F\u00eates de Bayonne]].\n\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as ''Bayonnais'' or ''Bayonnaises''.<ref>[http://www.habitants.fr/pyrenees-atlantiques-64 Inhabitants of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques] {{Fr icon}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBayonne is located in the south-west of France on the western border between [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] and [[Gascony]]. It developed at the confluence of the [[Adour]] and tributary on the left bank, the [[Nive]], 6&nbsp;km from the Atlantic coast. The commune was part of the Basque province of [[Labourd]].\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Neighbouring communes and villages'''<ref name=Google/>\n|Centre    = Bayonne \n|North     = [[Tamos]]\n|Northeast = [[Saint-Martin-de-Seignanx]]\n|East      = [[Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, Landes|Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy]]\n|Southeast = [[Lahonce]]\n|South     = [[Villefranque, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Villefranque]]\n|Southwest = [[Bassussarry]]\n|West      = [[Anglet]]\n|Northwest = [[Boucau]]\n}}\n\n===Geology and relief===\nBayonne occupies a territory characterized by a flat relief to the west and to the north towards the [[Landes forest]], tending to slightly raise towards the south and east. The city has developed at the confluence of the Adour and Nive {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=off}} from the ocean. The meeting point of the two rivers coincides with a narrowing of the Adour valley. Above this the alluvial plain extends for nearly {{convert|30|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} towards both [[Tercis-les-Bains]] and [[Peyrehorade]], and is characterized by swampy meadows called ''barthes'' which are influenced by floods and high tides.<ref group=\"Note\">In [[Gascony]] and in Basque country alluvial floodplains along a river are called ''barthe'' (from the [[gascon language|gascon]] ''barta'')</ref> Downstream from this point the river has shaped a large bed in the sand dunes creating a significant bottleneck at the confluence.\n\nThe occupation of the hill that dominates this narrowing of the valley developed through a gradual spread across the lowlands by building embankments and the [[aggradation]] from flood soil.<ref group=PH name=p4>p. 4</ref>\n\nThe Nive has played a leading role in the development of the Bayonne river system in recent geological time by the formation of alluvial terraces that form the sub-soil of Bayonne beneath the surface accumulations of silt and aeolian sands.<ref group=PH name=p3>p. 3</ref> The drainage network of the western [[Pre-Pyrenees]] evolved mostly from the [[Quaternary]] from south-east to northwest oriented east-west. The Adour was then captured by the gaves and this system, together with the Nive, led to the emergence of a new alignment of the lower Adour and the Adour-Nive confluence. This capture has been dated to the early Quaternary (80,000 years ago).<ref group=PH name=p3/>\n\nBefore this capture the Nive had deposited pebbles from the [[Mindel glaciation]] of medium to large sizes that slowed erosion of the hills causing the bottleneck at Bayonne. After the deposit of the lowest alluvial terrace ({{convert|10|to(-)|15|m|ft|abbr=off}} high at Grand Bayonne), the course of the Adour became fixed in its lower reaches.<ref group=PH name=p3/>\n\nSubsequent to these deposits there was a rise in sea level in the [[Holocene]] period (from 15,000 to 5000 years ago) which explains the invasion of the lower valleys with fine sand, peat, and mud with a thickness of more than {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=off}} below the current bed of the Adour and the Nive in Bayonne. These same deposits are spread across the barthes.<ref group=PH name=p4/>\n\nIn the late Quaternary the topographic physiognomy we know today was formed\u2014i.e. a set of hills overlooking a swampy lowland. The promontory of [[Bassussarry]]\u2013Marracq ultimately extended to the labourdin foothills, dying out at the Grand Bayonne hill is an example. Similarly, on the right bank of the Nive, the heights of Ch\u00e2teau-Neuf (Mocoron Hill) met the latest advance of the plateau of Saint-Pierre-d'Irube (height {{convert|30|to(-)|35|m|ft|abbr=off}}).<ref group=PH name=p4/> On the right bank of the Adour the heights of Castelnau (today the citadel) with an altitude of {{convert|35|to(-)|40|m|ft|abbr=off}}, and Fort (today Saint-Esprit) with an altitude of {{convert|20|to(-)|25|m|ft|abbr=off}} rise above the Barthes of the Adour, the Nive, Bourgneuf, Saint-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, Sainte-Croix, Aritxague, and Pontots.<ref group=PH name=p4/>\n\nThe area of the commune is {{convert|2,168|ha|abbr=off}} and its altitude varies between {{convert|0|to(-)|55|m|ft|abbr=off}}.<ref>[http://professionnels.ign.fr/rgc#tab-3 ''Geographic Repertoire of communes''], published by the [[Institut g\u00e9ographique national]] {{Fr icon}}</ref>\n\n===Hydrography===\n[[File:Bayonne Adour HdV.jpg|thumb|The confluence of the [[Adour]] and the [[Nive]] from the right bank of the Adour.]]\n\nThe city is traversed by the Adour.<ref name=\"sandre\">[http://sandre.eaufrance.fr/app/chainage/courdo/htm/Q---0000.php?cg=Q---0000 Watercourse: Adour River (Q---0000)], [[Sandre]] website, consulted on 25 July 2014 {{Fr icon}}</ref> The river is part of the [[Natura 2000]] network from its source at [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre]] to its exit to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] after Bayonne, between [[Tarnos]] (Landes) for the right bank and [[Anglet]] (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques) for the left bank.<ref>[http://www.institution-adour.fr/index.php/natura-2000-ladour.html ''The Adour in the Natura 2000 network''], Institution Adour website, consulted on 23 August 2014 {{Fr icon}}</ref><ref>[http://inpn.mnhn.fr/site/natura2000/FR7200724 Page FR7200724 Natura 2000], National Inventory of Natural heritage website, consulted on 23 August 2014 {{Fr icon}}</ref>\n\nApart from the [[Nive]], which converges on the left bank of the Adour after {{convert|79.3|km|mi|1|abbr=off}} of a sometimes tumultuous course, two tributaries join the Adour in Bayonne commune: the ''Ruisseau de Portou'' and the ''Ruisseau du Moulin Esbouc''.

The city is served by three interchanges\u2014two of them on the A63: exit {{Motorway exit|6}} (Bayonne Nord) serves the northern districts of Bayonne but also allows quick access to the centre while exit {{Motorway exit|5}} (Bayonne Sud) provides access to the south and also serves [[Anglet]]. The third exit is the D1 / A64 via the Mousserolles interchange (exit {{Motorway exit|1}} Bayonne Mousserolles) which links the district of the same name and also serves the neighbouring communes of [[Mouguerre]] and [[Saint-Pierre-d'Irube]].\n\nBayonne was traversed by [[Route nationale 10]] connecting [[Paris]] to [[Hendaye]] but this is now downgraded to a departmental road D810.

The Saint-Esprit bridge connects the Saint-Esprit district to the Amiral-Bergeret dock just upstream of the confluence with the river Nive.

It was expanded in 1912 to facilitate the movement of horse-drawn [[carriage]]s and motor vehicles.<ref group=FL name=p118/>\n\nOn the Nive coming from upstream to downstream there is the A63 bridge then the ''Pont Blanc'' (White bridge)<ref group=\"Note\">The successor to the iron railway bridge ''Raccordement d'A\u00eftachouria'', the Pont Blanc has been used since 2003 to link the ''Floride Sports Field'' to the wilderness area on the Ansot plain.</ref> railway bridge, and then D810 bridge, the G\u00e9nie bridge (or ''Pont Millitaire''), the Pannecau bridge, the Marengo bridge<ref group=Note>The Marengo masonry bridge was under [[Napoleon III]].</ref> leading to the covered markets, and the Mayou Bridge<ref group=Note>The Mayou bridge, formerly called ''Major'' or ''Maior'', was rebuilt in stone in 1857.</ref> The Pannecau bridge was long named ''Bertaco bridge'' and was rebuilt in masonry under [[Napoleon III]].<ref group=FL name=p25>p. 25.</ref> According to Fran\u00e7ois Lafitte Houssat, \"[...] a municipal ordinance of 1327 provided for the imprisonment of any quarrellsome woman of bad character in an iron cage dropped into the waters of the Nive River from the bridge.

There is ''Plastitube'' specializing in plastic packaging (190 employees).<ref name=\"Brunet\"/> The [[Izarra (liqueur)|Izarra]] liqueur company set up a distillery in 1912 at Quai Amiral-Bergeret and has long symbolized the economic wealth of Bayonne. Industrial activities are concentrated in the neighbouring communes of [[Boucau]], [[Tarnos]] ([[Turbomeca]]), [[Mouguerre]], and [[Anglet]].\n\nBayonne is known for its fine chocolates, produced in the town for 500 years, and Bayonne ham, a cured ham seasoned with peppers from nearby [[Espelette]]. [[Izarra (liqueur)|Izarra]], the liqueur made in bright green or yellow colours, is distilled locally. It is said by some that Bayonne is the birthplace of [[mayonnaise]], supposedly a corruption of ''Bayonnaise'', the French adjective describing the city's people and produce. Now bayonnaise can refer to a particular mayonnaise flavoured with the Espelette chillis.\n\nBayonne is now the centre of certain craft industries that were once widespread, including the manufacture of ''[[makila]]s'', traditional Basque walking-sticks. The Fabrique Alza just outside the city is known for its ''palas'', bats used in ''[[Basque pelota|pelota]]'', the traditional Basque sport.\n\n===Service activities===\nThe active tertiary sector includes some large retail chains such as those detailed by geographer [[Roger Brunet]]:<ref name=\"Brunet\">[http://tresordesregions.mgm.fr Roger Brunet personal website], consulted on 5 August 2014 {{Fr icon}}.</ref> BUT (240 staff), [[Carrefour]] (150 staff), [[E.Leclerc]] (150 staff), [[Leroy Merlin]] (130 staff), and [[Galeries Lafayette]] (120 employees). Banks, cleaning companies (Onet, 170 employees), and security ([[Brink's]], 100 employees) are also major employers in the commune, as is urban transport which employs nearly 200 staff. Five health clinics, providing a total of more than 500 beds, each employ 120 to 170 staff.<ref name=\"Brunet\"/>\n\n===The port of Bayonne===\n[[File:BBC-Magellan \u00e0 Bayonne.jpg|thumb|The cargo ship ''BBC-Magellan'' in the port of Bayonne in 2014.]]\n\nThe port of Bayonne is located at the mouth of the Adour, downstream of the city.

The houses lining the Nive are examples of Basque architecture, with half-timbering and shutters in the national colours of red and green. The much wider Adour is to the north. The Pont Saint-Esprit connects Petit Bayonne with the Quartier Saint-Esprit across the [[Adour]], where the massive Citadelle and the railway station are located. Grand Bayonne is the commercial and civic hub, with small pedestrianised streets packed with shops, plus the cathedral and [[City and town halls|H\u00f4tel de Ville]].\n\nThe [[Bayonne Cathedral|Cath\u00e9drale Sainte-Marie]] is an imposing, elegant [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building, rising over the houses, glimpsed along the narrow streets. It was constructed in the 12th and 13th centuries. The south tower was completed in the 16th century but the cathedral was only completed in the 19th century with the north tower. The cathedral is noted for its charming [[cloister]]s. There are other details and sculptures of note, although much was destroyed in the [[French Revolution|Revolution]].\n\nNearby is the Ch\u00e2teau Vieux, some of which dates back to the 12th century, where the governors of the city were based, including the English [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]].\n[[File:BayonneCatedral.JPG|thumb|Sainte-Marie Cathedral]]\n\nThe Mus\u00e9e Basque is the finest ethnographic museum of the entire Basque Country. It opened in 1922 but has been closed for a decade recently for refurbishment. It now has special exhibitions on Basque agriculture, seafaring and ''[[Basque pelota|pelota]]'', handicrafts and Basque history and way of life.\n\nThe [[Mus\u00e9e Bonnat]] began with a large collection bequeathed by the local-born painter [[L\u00e9on Bonnat]]. The museum is one of the best galleries in south west France and has paintings by [[Edgar Degas]], [[El Greco]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Francisco Goya]], among others.\n\nAt the back of Petit Bayonne is the Ch\u00e2teau Neuf, among the ramparts. Now an exhibition space, it was started by the newly arrived French in 1460 to control the city. The walls nearby have been opened to visitors. They are important for plant life now and Bayonne's [[Jardin botanique de Bayonne|botanic gardens]] adjoin the walls on both sides of the Nive.\n\nThe area across the Adour is largely residential and industrial, with much demolished to make way for the railway. The Saint-Esprit church was part of a bigger complex built by [[Louis XI of France|Louis&nbsp;XI]] to care for [[Way of St James|pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela]]. It is home to a wooden ''Flight into Egypt'' sculpture.\n\nOverlooking the quarter is Vauban's 1680 Citadelle. The soldiers of Wellington's army who died besieging the citadelle in 1813 are buried in the nearby English Cemetery, visited by [[Queen Victoria]] and other British dignitaries when staying in [[Biarritz]].\n\nThe distillery of the famous local liqueur [[Izarra (liqueur)|Izarra]] is located on the northern bank of the Adour and is open to visitors.\n\n[[File:Bayonne Caserne.jpg|thumb|Citadel]]\n\n==Personalities==\n* [[Edmund Crouchback]] or Edmond Plantagenet, [[Earl of Lancaster]], born in 1245 at [[London]] and died in 1296 at Bayonne, was an English prince.

The series is notable in that it was one of the few early anime series that were brought over from [[Japan]] unedited and subtitled in English. While anime has become much more popular in the years since, in 1991, it was still mostly unknown as a storytelling medium in North America. ''Bubblegum Crisis'' was aired in the US when it first aired on [[PBS]] affiliate [[KTEH-TV|Superstation KTEH]] in the 1990s, and [[STARZ!]]'s [[Encore (TV channel)|Action]] Channel in 2000.\n\nAn English dub of the series was produced beginning in 1994 by AnimEigo through Southwynde Studios in Wilmington, NC, and released to VHS and Laserdisc beginning that year. A digitally-remastered compilation, featuring bilingual audio tracks and production extras, was released on DVD in 2004 by AnimEigo. The company later successfully crowdfunded a collector's edition Blu-ray release through [[Kickstarter]] in November 2013.<ref>http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/madoverlord/bubblegum-crisis-ultimate-edition-blu-ray-set</ref> The series will be released on a regular edition Blu-ray on September 25, 2018. The series is currently available for streaming on [[Night Flight Plus]].\n\n===Soundtracks===\nThere are 8 soundtrack releases (one per OVA), as well as numerous \"vocal\" albums which feature songs \"inspired by\" the series as well as many drawn directly from it.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Masaki Kajishima]] and [[Hiroki Hayashi]], who both worked on the ''Bubblegum Crisis'' OAVs, cite the show as being the inspiration for their harem series ''[[Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki]]''. In an interview with AIC, Hayashi described ''Bubblegum Crisis'' as \"a pretty gloomy anime. Serious fighting, complicated human relationships, and dark Mega Tokyo.\" They thought it would be fun to create some comedy episodes with ideas like the girls going to the hot springs, but it was rejected by the sponsors. He also said that there was a trend to have a bunch of characters of one gender and a single one of the other gender, and asked what if Mackey (Sylia's brother) was a main character, reversing the ''Bubblegum'' scenario. This idea then became the basis for Tenchi. Hayashi said that Mackey is \"sort of\" the original model for Tenchi.<ref name=\"hayashi interview\">{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705232238/http://www.aicanime.com/about/interview_hayashi.html | archivedate=July 5, 2011 | deadurl=yes | work = AIC Anime English Website | publisher=[[Anime International Company]] | title=Interview with Hiroki Hayashi | date=February 2011 | url=http://www.aicanime.com/about/interview_hayashi.html}}</ref>\n\n[[Kevin Siembieda]]'s becoming aware of \"Boomers\" being already in use in this caused him to changed his planned name for the [[Rifts RPG]] which he had named after the \"Boom Gun\"-wielding power armor which was also renamed to ''Glitter Boy''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rifts Ultimate Edition}}</ref>\n\n==Spin-offs==\n===''Bubblegum Crash''===\n[[File:Bubblegum Crash Total Crash Collection-DVDcover.jpg|thumb|right|DVD cover from ''Bubblegum Crash Total Crash Collection'']]\n\nThe success of the series spawned several sequel series.

After the split between Artmic and Youmex, Artmic proceeded to make a sequel on their own, ''Bubblegum Crash'', which ran three OVA episodes and is conjectured that it was a shortened version of how ''Crisis'' was to end. Youmex promptly sued Artmic, cutting ''Crash'' short and tying the entire franchise up in legal issues for the next several years.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2017}}\n\nIt is set in 2034, and the Knight Sabers seem to be finished; each of its members - except Nene - have seemingly drifted off to pursue their own goals. But at the same time, parts of a unique [[artificial intelligence]] are stolen by several villains acting under the orders of a mysterious voice. Unexpectedly, Sylia resurfaces and prepares her teammates for battle. And as a gigantic machine drills its way to Mega Tokyo's main nuclear power plant, they meet again with an old and deadly enemy.\n\n====Episodes====\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:50%;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #CCF\"\n! width=\"20\" | # !!

As the European settlers acquired control of territory, they generally pushed the mixed-race and Bantu and Khoisan populations into second-class status. During the first half of the 20th century, the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups: ''Black'', ''White'', ''[[Asia]]n'' (mostly [[India]]n), and ''[[Coloured]]''.<!--These terms are capitalized to denote their legal definitions in South African law.--> The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu, Khoisan, and European descent (with some [[Cape Malays|Malay]] ancestry, especially in the [[Western Cape]]). The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa. It imposed a system of legal racial segregation, a complex of laws known as [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]].\n\nThe [[apartheid]] bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria in the [[Population Registration Act]] of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group. Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications. When it was unclear from a person's physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black, the \"[[Pencil test (South Africa)|pencil test]]\" was used. A pencil was inserted into a person's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough to hold the pencil, rather than having it pass through, as it would with smoother hair. If so, the person was classified as Black.<ref>{{cite news|author=Nullis, Clare|title=Township tourism booming in South Africa|agency=[[Associated Press]]|year=2007|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2007/01/08/township-tourism-booming-in-south-africa/|date=8 January 2007|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref> Such classifications sometimes divided families.\n\n[[Sandra Laing]] is a South African woman who was classified as Coloured by authorities during the apartheid era, due to her [[Human skin colour|skin colour]] and [[hair#hair texture|hair texture]], although her parents could prove at least three generations of European ancestors.

She was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film ''[[Skin (2008 film)|Skin]]'', which won numerous awards.\n\nDuring the apartheid era, those classed as \"Coloured\" were oppressed and discriminated against. But, they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as \"Black\". The government required that Blacks and Coloureds live in areas separate from Whites, creating large townships located away from the cities as areas for Blacks.\n\nIn the post-apartheid era, the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a \"Non-racial democracy\". In an effort to redress past injustices, the ANC government has introduced laws in support of [[affirmative action]] policies for Blacks; under these they define \"Black\" people to include \"Africans\", \"Coloureds\" and \"Asians\". Some [[affirmative action]] policies favor \"Africans\" over \"Coloureds\" in terms of qualifying for certain benefits. Some South Africans categorized as \"African Black\" say that \"Coloureds\" did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid. \"Coloured\" South Africans are known to discuss their dilemma by saying, \"we were not white enough under apartheid, and we are not black enough under the ANC ([[African National Congress]])\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/in-south-africa-after-apartheid-colored-community-is-the-big-loser/|title=Not White Enough, Not Black Enough|author=By Eusebius McKaiser|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=May 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>Hatred for Black People; by Shehu Sani; Xlibris Corporation, 2013; {{ISBN|9781493120765}}; page 43.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://open.uct.ac.za/bitstream/handle/11427/21228/Adhikari_article_2004.pdf?sequence=1|title=\u2018Not Black Enough\u2019: Changing Expressions of Coloured Identity in Post-Apartheid South Africa|author=Mohamed Adhikari|journal=South African Historical Journal|volume=51|year=2004|page=168}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the High Court in South Africa ruled that [[Chinese South Africans]] who were residents during the apartheid era (and their descendants) are to be reclassified as \"Black people,\" solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits, because they were also \"disadvantaged\" by racial discrimination.

The number of enslaved people sold to the New World varied throughout the slave trade. As for the distribution of slaves from regions of activity, certain areas produced far more enslaved people than others. Between 1650 and 1900, 10.24 million enslaved West Africans arrived in the Americas from the following regions in the following proportions:<ref name=\"Lovejoy\">Lovejoy, Paul E.

One well-known example is the identification by Reverend [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] of his own race as \"Negro\" in his famous speech of 1963, [[I Have a Dream]]. During the American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, some African-American leaders in the United States, notably [[Malcolm X]], objected to the word ''Negro'' because they associated it with the long history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens, or worse.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith, Tom W|year=1992|title=Changing racial labels: from 'Colored' to 'Negro' to 'Black' to 'African American'|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=56|issue=4|pages=496\u2013514|doi=10.1086/269339}}</ref> Malcolm X preferred ''Black'' to ''Negro'', but later gradually abandoned that as well for ''Afro-American'' after leaving the [[Nation of Islam]].<ref>Liz Mazucci, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/mxp/Souls.Going_Back_To_Our_Own.pdf \"Going Back to Our Own: Interpreting Malcolm X\u2019s Transition From 'Black Asiatic' to 'Afro-American'\"], ''Souls'' 7(1), 2005, pp. 66\u201383.</ref>\n\nSince the late 1960s, various other terms for African Americans have been more widespread in popular usage. Aside from ''Black American'', these include ''Afro-American'' (in use from the late 1960s to 1990) and ''African American'' (used in the United States to refer to Black Americans, people often referred to in the past as ''American Negroes'').<ref>Christopher H.

Individuals identified themselves, for example, as [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Kongo people|Bakongo]], or [[Wolof people|Wolof]]. However, when the first captives were brought to [[the Americas]], they were often combined with other groups from West Africa, and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists. In areas of the Upper South, different ethnic groups were brought together. This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region: the West African coastline stretching from [[Senegal]] to [[Angola]] and in some cases from the south-east coast such as [[Mozambique]]. A new ''African-American'' identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as the [[Black church]] and [[African-American English]]. This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm|title=LINGUISTICS AND AFRICA {{!}} Black or African {{!}} Sub-Saharan Africa {{!}} Feminism {{!}} Pre-Colonial {{!}} Spiritual vs Religious|last=|first=|date=|website=www.africanholocaust.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\nBy contrast, slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans, including ethnicities and given tribal names.<ref>Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Africans_in_Colonial_Louisiana.html?id=Arybfb4UWtwC ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century''], Louisiana State University Press, 1992/1995.</ref>\n\nThe US racial or ethnic classification \"black\" refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation, from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors, including [[albinos]], if they are believed by others to have African ancestry (in any discernible percentage). There are also certain cultural traits associated with being \"[[African American]]\", a term used effectively as a synonym for \"black person\" within the United States.\n\nIn March 1807, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], which largely controlled the Atlantic, declared [[Slave Trade Act 1807|the transatlantic slave trade illegal]], as did the United States. (The latter prohibition took effect 1 January 1808, the earliest date on which [[United States Congress|Congress]] had the power to do so after protecting the slave trade under [[s:Constitution of the United States of America#Section 9|Article I, Section 9]] of the [[United States Constitution]].)\n[[File:Clarence Thomas official SCOTUS portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] [[Clarence Thomas]]]]\nBy that time, the majority of black people in the United States were native-born, so the use of the term \"African\" became problematic. Though initially a source of pride, many blacks feared that the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US. They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa. In 1835, black leaders called upon Black Americans to remove the title of \"African\" from their institutions and replace it with \"[[Negro]]\" or \"Colored American\". A few institutions chose to keep their historic names, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]. African Americans popularly used the terms \"Negro\" or \"colored\" for themselves until the late 1960s.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1594200831/ ''African American Journeys to Africa''], pp. 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nThe term ''black'' was used throughout but not frequently since it carried a certain stigma.

In place of ''Negro'', activists promoted the use of ''black'' as standing for racial pride, militancy, and power. Some of the turning points included the use of the term \"[[Black Power]]\" by Kwame Toure ([[Stokely Carmichael]]) and the popular singer [[James Brown]]'s song \"[[Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud]]\".\n[[File:Jordan by Lipofsky 16577.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Jordan]], an African American basketball player.]]\nIn 1988, the civil rights leader [[Jesse Jackson]] urged Americans to use instead the term \"African American\" because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants, such as German American, Italian American, etc. Since then, African American and black have often had parallel status. However, controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate.

Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside Africa. In contrast to the US, during the slavery period and after, the Portuguese colonial government in Brazil and the later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-[[miscegenation]] or segregation laws. As in other Latin American countries, [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward. In addition, people of [[mixed race]] (''pardo'') often tended to marry white spouses, and their descendants became accepted as white. As a result, some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood. According to the last census of the 20th century, in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified, 54% of individuals identified as white, 6.2% identified as black, and 39.5% identified as pardo (brown)&nbsp;\u2014 a broad multi-racial category, including tri-racial persons.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA World Factbook: Brazil|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, a philosophy of [[racial whitening]] emerged in Brazil, related to the assimilation of mixed-race people into the white population through intermarriage. Until recently the government did not keep data on race. However, statisticians estimate that in 1835, roughly 50% of the population was ''preto'' (black; most were [[Slavery in Latin America|enslaved]]), a further 20% was ''pardo'' (brown), and 25% white, with the remainder [[Amerindian]]. Some classified as pardo were tri-racial.\n\nBy the 2000 census, demographic changes including the end to slavery, immigration from Europe and Asia, assimilation of multiracial persons, and other factors resulted in a population in which 6.2% of the population identified as black, 40% as pardo, and 55% as white. Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multi-racial category by intermixing.<ref name=\"skidmore\" /> A 2007 genetic study found that at least 29% of the middle-class, white Brazilian population had some recent (since 1822 and the end of the colonial period) African ancestry.<ref>V.F.

In [[septicemia|septicemic]] plague, bacterial endotoxins cause [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischaemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal. Early treatment with [[antibiotics]] reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 percent.<ref name=\"Wagle1948\">{{cite journal| author=Wagle PM| title=Recent advances in the treatment of bubonic plague| journal=Indian J Med Sci| year=1948| volume=2| pages=489\u201394| ref=harv }}</ref><ref name=\"Meyer1950\">{{cite journal| author=Meyer KF| title=Modern therapy of plague| year=1950| journal=J Am Med Assoc| volume=144| pages=982\u201385| pmid=14774219| issue=12| doi=10.1001/jama.1950.02920120006003| ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"DattGupta1948\">{{cite journal| author=Datt Gupta AK| title=A short note on plague cases treated at Campbell Hospital| journal=Ind Med Gaz| year=1948| volume=83| pages=150\u201351| ref=harv}}</ref> People who die from this form of plague often die on the same day symptoms first appear.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Pneumonic plague===\n{{Main|Pneumonic plague}}\nThe [[pneumonia|pneumonic]] form of plague arises from [[infection]] of the [[human lung|lungs]].

The [[incubation period]] for pneumonic plague is short, usually two to four days, but sometimes just a few hours. The initial signs are indistinguishable from several other respiratory illnesses; they include headache, weakness and spitting or vomiting of blood.

The natural foci of plague are situated in a broad belt in the tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and the warmer parts of the temperate latitudes around the globe, between the parallels 55 degrees North and 40 degrees South.<ref name=PM/>\nContrary to popular belief, rats did not directly start the spread of the bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the [[flea]]s (''[[Xenopsylla cheopis]]'') that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new person and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yersin|first=Alexandre|year=1894|orig-year=|title=La peste bubonique \u00e0 Hong-Kong|url=http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/histoire/medica/resultats/index.php?p=3&cote=epo1234&do=page|journal=Annales de l'Institut Pasteur|volume=8|pages=662\u201367}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\n{{Main|Plague vaccine}}\nSince human plague is rare in most parts of the world, routine vaccination is not needed other than for those at particularly high risk of exposure, nor for people living in areas with [[enzootic]] plague, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas, such as the western [[United States]]. It is not even indicated for most travellers to countries with known recent reported cases, particularly if their travel is limited to urban areas with modern hotels.

[[Han Dynasty]] General [[Huo Qubing]] is recorded to have died of such a contamination while engaging in warfare against the Xiongnu. Plague victims were also reported to have been tossed by [[catapult]] into cities under siege.\n\nIn 1347, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession of [[Feodosia|Caffa]], a great trade emporium on the [[Crimean peninsula]], came under siege by an army of [[Mongol]] warriors of the [[Golden Horde]] under the command of [[Janibeg]]. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army was reportedly withering from the disease, they decided to use the infected corpses as a biological weapon. The corpses were catapulted over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants. This event might have led to the transfer of the plague ([[Black Death]]) via their ships into the south of [[Europe]], possibly explaining its rapid spread.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol8no9/01-0536.htm |author=Wheelis M. |title=Biological warfare at the 1346 siege of Caffa |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |year = 2002 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536 |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971\u201375 |pmid=12194776 |pmc=2732530 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] developed weaponised plague, based on the breeding and release of large numbers of fleas.

While no records survive of the actual usage of the ceramic shells, prototypes exist and are believed to have been used in experiments during WWII.\n\nAfter World War II, both the United States and the Soviet Union developed means of weaponising pneumonic plague. Experiments included various delivery methods, vacuum drying, sizing the bacterium, developing strains resistant to antibiotics, combining the bacterium with other diseases (such as [[diphtheria]]), and genetic engineering. Scientists who worked in USSR bio-weapons programs have stated that the Soviet effort was formidable and that large stocks of weaponised plague bacteria were produced. Information on many of the Soviet projects is largely unavailable. Aerosolized pneumonic plague remains the most significant threat.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe plague can be easily treated with antibiotics, which some countries, such as the United States, have large supplies on hand if such an attack should occur, thus making the threat less severe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Diseases of the Human Body|last=Tamparo|first=Carol|last2=Lewis|first2=Marcia|publisher=F.A.

The cipher was not designed for machine telecommunications (it was instead a method of [[steganography|encrypting a hidden message into another]]) and, although in theory it could be adapted to that purpose, it only covered 24 of the 26 letters of the English alphabet (two sets of letters, I/J and U/V, were expressed with the same code) and contained no punctuation, spaces, numbers or [[control character]]s, rendering it of little use.<ref>{{Citation | title = Bacon's Bilateral Cipher | url = http://www.math.cornell.edu/~morris/135/Bacon.pdf | accessdate = 15 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBaudot invented his original code in 1870{{cn|date=April 2017|reason=We need top-reliable or even primary sources here as multiple other sources are differing in the date.}} and patented it in 1874.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leoferres.info/images/baudot_cp1874.jpg|title=Jean-Maurice- Emile Baudot.

Note the fully punched columns of \"Delete/Letters select\" codes at start of the message (on the right); were used to cut the band easily between distinct messages. The message then starts with a figure shift control followed by a carriage return.]]\nIn 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]] (1865\u20131945), prompted by his development of a typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step; a keyboard perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a paper tape, and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the [[punched tape]]. At the receiving end of the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Foster |first=Maximilian |date=August 1901 |title=A Successful Printing Telegraph |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=II |pages=1195\u20131199 |id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IF6tNZnhO7wC&pg=PA1195 |accessdate=2009-07-09 |quote= }}</ref> As there was no longer a connection between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most [[letter frequencies|frequently used characters]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=38}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Telegraph and Telephone Age |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFUiAQAAMAAJ&q=%22I+allocated+the+most+frequently+used+letters+in+the+English+language+to+the+signals+represented+by+the+fewest+holes+in+the+perforated+tape%22&dq=%22I+allocated+the+most+frequently+used+letters+in+the+English+language+to+the+signals+represented+by+the+fewest+holes+in+the+perforated+tape%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIi9mg88WQxgIVjpWICh2HxAgz|year=1921 |quote=I allocated the most frequently used letters in English language to the signals represented by the fewest holes in the perforated tape, and so on in proportion.}}</ref>\n\nFor example, the one-hole letters are E and T. The ten two-hole letters are AOINSHRDLZ, very similar to the \"[[Etaoin shrdlu]]\" order used in [[Linotype machine]]s. Ten more letters have three holes, and the four-hole letters are VXKQ.\n\nThe Murray code also introduced what became known as \"format effectors\" or \"[[control character]]s\"{{snd}} the [[Carriage return|CR]] (Carriage Return) and [[Newline|LF]] (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent, but the same code was used to encode the space separation between words. Sequences of DEL codes (fully punched columns) were used at start or end of messages or between them, allowing easy separation of distinct messages. (BELL codes could be inserted in those sequences to signal to the remote operator that a new message was coming or that transmission of a message was terminated).\n\nEarly [[Creed & Company|British Creed]] machines used the Murray system.\n\n===Western Union===\n[[File:Baudotkeyboard.png|right|frame|422px|Keyboard of a [[teleprinter]] using the Baudot code (US variant), with FIGS and LTRS shift keys]]\nMurray's code was adopted by [[Western Union]] which used it until the 1950s, with a few changes that consisted of omitting some characters and adding more control codes. An explicit SPC (space) character was introduced, in place of the BLANK/NULL, and a new [[Bell character|BEL]] code rang a bell or otherwise produced an audible signal at the receiver. Additionally, the WRU or \"Who aRe yoU?\" code was introduced, which caused a receiving machine to send an identification stream back to the sender.\n{{clear}}\n\n==={{anchor|MTK-2}}ITA2===\n{{Infobox character encoding\n| name = ITA2 Baudot\u2013Murray code\n| alias = International Telegraph Alphabet 2\n| image = International Telegraph Alphabet 2.jpg\n| caption = British variant of ITA2\n| prev = [[#ITA1|ITA1]]\n| next = [[FIELDATA]], [[US-ASCII]]\n| classification = 5-bit [[state (computer science)|stateful]] [[ISO Basic Latin alphabet|basic Latin]] encoding\n}}\n{{Infobox character encoding\n| name = MTK-2\n| alias = \n| image = \n| caption = \n| prev = [[Russian Morse code]]\n| next = [[KOI-7]]\n| lang = [[Russian language|Russian]]\n| classification = 5-bit [[state (computer science)|stateful]] [[Russian alphabet|Russian Cyrillic]] encoding\n}}\nIn 1924, the [[CCITT]] introduced the '''International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2''' ('''ITA2''') code<ref>{{cite web|title=BruXy: Radio Teletype communication |date=2005-10-10 |accessdate=2016-05-09 |url=http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/hamradio/EN/radio-teletype-communication/ |quote=The transmitted code use International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA-2) which was introduced by CCITT in 1924.}}</ref> as an international standard, which was based on the Western Union code with some minor changes.

During long periods of idle time, the impulse rate was not synchronized between both devices (which could even be powered off or not permanently interconnected on commuted phone lines). To start a message it was first necessary to calibrate the impulse rate a sequence of regularly timed \"mark\" pulses (1) by group of five pulses, which could also be detected by simple passive electronic devices to turn on the teleprinter; this series of pulse was generating series of Erasure/Delete and also initializing the receiver state to the Letters shift mode, however the first pulse could be lost, so this power on procedure could then be terminated by a single Null immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete character. To preserve the synchronization between devices, the Null code could not be used arbitrarily in the middle of messages (this was an improvement to the initial Baudot system where spaces were not explicitly differentiated, so it was difficult to maintain the pulse counters for repeating spaces on teleprinters). But it was then possible to resynchronize devices at any time by sending a Null in the middle of a message (immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete/LS control if followed by a letter, or by a FS control if followed by a figure). Sending Null controls also did not cause the paper band to advance to the next row (as nothing was punched), so this saved precious lengths of punchable paper band. On the opposite the Erasure/Delete/LS control code was always punched and always shifted to the (initial) letters mode. According to some sources, the Null code point was reserved for country-internal usage only.<ref name=\"Steinbuch-Weber_1974\"/>\n\nThe Shift to Letters code (LS) is also usable as a way to cancel/delete text from a punched tape after it has been read, allowing a safe destruction of the message before recycling the punched band. For that function, it also plays the same role of filler as the Delete code in ASCII (and also in other 7-bit or 8-bit encodings, including EBCDIC for punched cards). Once codes for a fragment text has been replaced by arbitrary number of LS codes, what follows is still preserved and decodable. It can also be used as an initiator to make sure that the decoding of the first code will not give a digit or another symbol from the figures page (because the Null code may be arbitrarily inserted near the end of a punch band or at start of it, and has to be ignored, whereas the Space code is significant in text).\n\nThe cells marked as reserved for extensions (using the LS code again from the letters shift page, just after a first LS code to shift from the figures page) has been defined to shift into a new mode: in this new mode, the letters page are containing lowercase letters only, but a third page of codes is still accessible for the uppercase letters, either temporarily for a single letter (encode LS before that letter), may be locked  (with FS+LS) for an unlimited number of capital letters or digits and then unlocked to return to lowercase mode (with a single LS).<ref>[[ITU-T]] [https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-S.1-198811-S!!PDF-E Recommendation S.2 / 11/1988], published in Fascicle VII.1 of the ''Blue Book''</ref> The cell marked as \"Reserved\" is also usable (using the FS code from the figures shift page) to switch the page of figures (which normally contains digits and ''national'' lowercase letters or symbols) to a fourth page (where national letters are uppercased and other symbols may be encoded).\n\nITA2 is still used in [[telecommunications devices for the deaf]] (TDD), [[telex]], and some [[amateur radio]] applications, such as [[radioteletype]] (\"RTTY\"). ITA2 is also used in Enhanced Broadcast Solution (an early 21st century financial protocol specified by [[Deutsche B\u00f6rse]]) to reduce the character encoding footprint.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Enhanced Broadcast Solution \u2013 Interface Specification Final Version | publisher = Deutsche B\u00f6rse | date = 17 May 2010 | url = https://www9.deutsche-boerse.com/INTERNET/XETRA/x4_member.nsf/0/4502210270B32DA8C1257600005247F5/$FILE/MUI11010_EnBS_FinalVersion.pdf/MUI11010_EnBS_FinalVersion.pdf?OpenElement | accessdate = 10 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\nNearly all 20th-century teleprinter equipment used Western Union's code, ITA2, or variants thereof.

Baudot and Murray is rightmost, and least significant. The way the transmitted bits were packed into larger codes varied by manufacturer. The most common solution allocates the bits from the least significant bit towards the most significant bit (leaving the three most significant bits of a byte unused).\n[[File:Ita2.png|right|frame|Table of ITA2 codes (expressed as [[hexadecimal]] numbers)]]\nIn ITA2, characters are expressed using five bits. ITA2 uses two code sub-sets, the \"letter shift\" (LTRS), and the \"figure shift\" (FIGS). The FIGS character (11011) signals that the following characters are to be interpreted as being in the FIGS set, until this is reset by the LTRS (11111) character. In use, the LTRS or FIGS shift key is pressed and released, transmitting the corresponding shift character to the other machine. The desired letters or figures characters are then typed. Unlike a typewriter or modern computer keyboard, the shift key isn't kept depressed whilst the corresponding characters are typed. \"ENQuiry\" will trigger the other machine's answerback. It means \"Who are you?\"\n\nCR is [[carriage return]], LF is [[line feed]], BEL is the [[bell character]] which rang a small [[bell (instrument)|bell]] (often used to alert operators to an incoming message), SP is space, and NUL is the [[null character]] (blank tape).\n\nNote: the binary conversions of the codepoints are often shown in reverse order, depending on (presumably) from which side one views the paper tape. Note further that the [[control character|\"control\" characters]] were chosen so that they were either symmetric or in useful pairs so that inserting a tape \"upside down\" did not result in problems for the equipment and the resulting printout could be deciphered.  Thus FIGS (11011), LTRS (11111) and space (00100) are invariant, while CR (00010) and LF (01000), generally used as a pair, are treated the same regardless of order by page printers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldpowersystems.com/ARCHIVE/historyOfCharacterCodes/index.html#ITA2|title=An annotated history of some character codes: ITA2|last=Jennings|first=Tom|date=20 April 2016|accessdate=20 January 2018|quote=[\u2026] the characters that are \u2018transmission control\u2019 related [\u2026] are bit-wise symmetrical \u2014 the codes for FIGS, LTRS, space and BLANK \u2014 are the same reversed left to right! Further, the codes for CR and LF, equal each other when reversed left to right!}}</ref> LTRS could also be used to overpunch characters to be deleted on a paper tape (much like DEL in 7-bit [[ASCII]]).\n\nThe sequence ''[[RY (test signal)|RYRYRY...]]'' is often used in test messages, and at the start of every transmission. Since R is 01010 and Y is 10101, the sequence exercises much of a teleprinter's mechanical components at maximum stress.  Also, at one time, fine-tuning of the receiver was done using two coloured lights (one for each tone).

This tuning sequence is only useful when ITA2 is used with two-tone [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] modulation, such as is commonly seen in [[radioteletype]] (RTTY) usage.\n\nUS implementations of Baudot code may differ in the addition of a few characters, such as #, & on the FIGS layer.\n\nThe Russian version of Baudot code ([[MTK-2]]) used three shift modes; the [[Cyrillic letter]] mode was activated by the character (00000). Because of the larger number of characters in the Cyrillic alphabet, the characters [[Exclamation Mark|!]], [[Ampersand|&]], [[Pound sign|\u00a3]] were omitted and replaced by Cyrillics, and [[Bell character|BEL]] has the same code as Cyrillic letter \u042e.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Asynchronous serial communication]]\n* [[List of computer character sets]]\n* [[Morse code]]\n* [[Prosigns for Morse code]]\n* [[Serial communication]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book | editor-last = Copeland | editor-first = B.

Under stressful environmental conditions, the bacteria can produce oval [[endospore]]s that are not true 'spores', but to which the bacteria can reduce themselves and remain in a dormant state for very long periods. These characteristics originally defined the genus, but not all such species are closely related, and many have been moved to other genera of the Firmicutes.<ref name=Brock>{{cite book | editor = Madigan M | editor2 = Martinko J | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 11th | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-13-144329-1 }}</ref>\n\nMany species of ''Bacillus'' can produce copious amounts of enzymes which are used in different industries. Some species can form intracellular inclusions of [[polyhydroxyalkanoates]] under certain adverse environmental conditions, as in a lack of elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, or oxygen combined with an excessive supply of carbon sources.\n\n''[[B. subtilis]]''  has proved a valuable model for research. Other species of ''Bacillus'' are important pathogens, causing [[anthrax]] and [[food poisoning]].\n\n==Industrial significance==\nMany ''Bacillus'' species are able to [[secretion|secrete]] large quantities of enzymes. ''[[Bacillus amyloliquefaciens]]'' is the source of a natural antibiotic protein [[barnase]] (a [[ribonuclease]]), [[alpha amylase]] used in starch hydrolysis, the [[protease]] [[subtilisin]] used with detergents, and the [[BamH1]] [[restriction enzyme]] used in DNA research.\n\nA portion of the ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' genome was incorporated into corn (and cotton) crops.

Its superb genetic amenability and relatively large size have provided the powerful tools required to investigate a bacterium from all possible aspects. Recent improvements in [[fluorescent microscopy]] techniques have provided novel insight into the dynamic structure of a single cell organism.

The [[type species]] is ''B. subtilis'', an important [[model organism]]. It is also a notable food spoiler, causing ropiness in bread and related food. Some environmental and commercial strains of ''[[Bacillus coagulans|B. coagulans]]'' may play a role in food spoilage of highly acidic, tomato-based products.\n\nAn easy way to isolate ''Bacillus'' species is by placing nonsterile soil in a [[test tube]] with water, shaking, placing in melted [[mannitol salt agar]], and incubating at room temperature for at least a day. Colonies are usually large, spreading, and irregularly shaped. Under the microscope, the ''Bacillus'' cells appear as rods, and a substantial portion of the cells usually contain oval [[endospore]]s at one end, making it bulge.\n\n== Cell wall ==\nThe cell wall of ''Bacillus'' is a structure on the outside of the cell that forms the second barrier between the bacterium and the environment, and at the same time maintains the rod shape and withstands the pressure generated by the cell's [[turgor]]. The cell wall is composed of [[teichoic acid|teichoic]] and teichuronic acids. ''B. subtilis'' is the first bacterium for which the role of an [[actin]]-like [[cytoskeleton]] in cell shape determination and [[peptidoglycan]] synthesis was identified, and for which the entire set of peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes was localised. The role of the cytoskeleton in shape generation and maintenance is important\n\n==Phylogeny==\nThe genus ''Bacillus'' was named in 1835 by [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]], to contain rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria. He had seven years earlier named the genus ''[[Bacterium]]''. ''Bacillus'' was later amended by [[Ferdinand Cohn]] to further describe them as spore-forming, Gram-positive, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria.<ref name=\"Cohn 1872\">{{de icon}} Cohn F.: ''Untersuchungen \u00fcber Bakterien.

He subsequently elaborated these into the Plano Piloto (Pilot Plan), and added the satellite city of Taguatinga.}}</ref> Visually, the blocks were intended to appear absorbed by the landscape because they were isolated by a belt of tall trees and lower vegetation.

This means that the original plan included paving streets that were not immediately put into use; the advantage of this is that the original plan is hard to undo because he provided for an entire street network, but on the other hand, is difficult to adapt and mold to other circumstances in the future.<ref name=\"Brasilia: Plan and Reality\"/> In addition, there has been controversy with the monumental aspect of L\u00facio Costa's Plan, because it appeared to some as city planning of the 19th century and not that of a modern urbanism of the 20th century in Brazil.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pess\u00f4a |first1=Jos\u00e9 |title=L\u00facio Costa and the Question of Monumentality in his Pilot Plan for Brasilia |date=Winter 2010|journal=docomomo Journal |volume=43, ''Brasilia 1960-2010'' |issn=1380-3204 | url=http://www.docomomo.com/shop/node/3}}</ref>\n\nAn interesting analysis can be made of Bras\u00edlia within the context of Cold War politics and the association of L\u00facio Costa\u2019s plan to the symbolism of aviation. From an architectural perspective, the airplane-shaped plan was certainly an homage to Le Corbusier and his enchantment with the aircraft as an architectural masterpiece. However, it is important to also note that Brasilia was constructed soon after the end of World War II. Despite Brazil\u2019s minor participation in the conflict, the airplane shape of the city was key in envisioning the country as part of the newly globalized world, together with the victorious Allies.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Denicke|first1=Lars|editor1-last=Hecht|editor1-first=Gabrielle|encyclopedia=Entangled geographies : empire and technopolitics in the global Cold War|date=2011|oclc=731854048| publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0262515784|pages=185\u2013208|title=Fifty years\u2019 progress in five : Brasilia\u2014modernization, globalism, and the geopolitics of flight}}\n</ref> Furthermore, Bras\u00edlia is a unique example of modernism both as a guideline for architectural design but also as a principle for organizing society.

In the Square of Three Powers, he created as a focal point the dramatic Congressional Palace, which is composed of five parts: twin administrative towers flanked by a large, white concrete dome (the meeting place of the Senate) and by an equally massive concrete bowl (the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]]), which is joined to the dome by an underlying, flat-roofed building.<ref>[http://www.tripbucket.com/dreams/dream/visit-brasilia-brazil-unesco-site/ Bras\u00edlia, Brazil (UNESCO site)] {{en icon}}</ref> The Congress also occupies various other surrounding buildings, some connected by tunnels. A series of low-lying annexes (largely hidden) flank both ends.\n\nThe National Congress building is located in the middle of the [[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]], the city's main avenue. In front lies a large lawn and reflecting pool. The building faces the [[Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes]] where the [[Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto]] and the [[Supreme Federal Court]] are located.\n\nAlso in the square are the glass-faced [[Planalto Palace]] housing the presidential offices, and the Palace of the Supreme Court. Farther east, on a triangle of land jutting into the lake, is the Palace of the Dawn (Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada; the presidential residence). Between the federal and civic buildings on the Monumental Axis is the city's cathedral, considered by many to be Niemeyer's finest achievement (see photographs of the interior). The parabolically shaped structure is characterized by its 16 gracefully curving supports, which join in a circle 115 feet (35 meters) above the floor of the nave; stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass. The nave is entered via a subterranean passage rather than conventional doorways. Other notable buildings are Buriti Palace, [[Itamaraty Palace]], the National Theater, and several foreign embassies that creatively embody features of their national architecture. The Brazilian landscape architect [[Roberto Burle Marx]] designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings.<ref>[http://www.charlesayoub.com/life-style/index.php/more/1/5157 Bras\u00edlia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507102131/http://www.charlesayoub.com/life-style/index.php/more/1/5157 |date=May 7, 2014 }} {{en icon}}</ref>\n\nBoth low-cost and luxury buildings were built by the government in the Bras\u00edlia.

As the city has matured, some of these have gained adornments, and many have been improved by landscaping, giving some observers a sense of \"humanized\" spaciousness. Although not fully accomplished, the \"Bras\u00edlia utopia\" has produced a city of relatively high quality of life, in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure (the ''superquadras'') flanked by small commercial areas, bookstores and caf\u00e9s; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit.<ref name=\"global.britannica.com\"/>\n\nEven these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname \"ilha da fantasia\" (\"fantasy island\"), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the states of [[Goi\u00e1s]] and [[Minas Gerais]], around Bras\u00edlia.<ref name=\"global.britannica.com\"/>\n\nCritics of Bras\u00edlia's grand scale have characterized it as a modernist bauhaus platonic fantasy about the future:\n\n{{Quotation|Nothing dates faster than people's fantasies about the future.

Niemeyer's project of Cathedral of Bras\u00edlia is based in the [[hyperboloid]] of revolution which sections are asymmetric. The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns. There is controversy as to what these columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t, represent, some say they are two hands moving upwards to heaven, others associate it to the chalice Jesus used in the last supper and some claim it represent his crown of thorns.

The rectangular lawn is surrounded by two eight-lane avenues where many government buildings, monuments and memorials are located. On Sundays and holidays, the Eixo Monumental is closed to cars so that locals may use it as a place to walk, bike, and have picnics under the trees.\n\n''[[Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes]]'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''Square of the Three Powers'') is a plaza in Bras\u00edlia. The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza: the Executive, represented by the [[Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto]] (presidential office); the Legislative, represented by the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] (Congresso Nacional); and the Judiciary branch, represented by the [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Federal Court]] (Supremo Tribunal Federal). It is a tourist attraction in Bras\u00edlia, designed by [[L\u00facio Costa]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously.\n\n{{wide image|Brasilia_Panorama.jpg|1500px|<center>Panorama of the [[Monumental Axis]]</center>}}\n\n;Palaces \n[[File:Palacio Alvorada commons.jpg|thumb|The [[Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada]]]]\n[[File:Planalto panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto]]]]\n\nThe [[Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada]] is the official residence of the [[president of Brazil]]. The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Bras\u00edlia, by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and inaugurated in 1958. One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, the \"Alvorada\" lies on a peninsula at the margins of [[Lake Parano\u00e1]]. The principles of simplicity and modernity, that in the past characterized the great works of architecture, motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landed on the ground with the support of thin external columns. The building has an area of 7,000 m<sup>2</sup> with three floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor. The auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace. The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.\n\nThe [[Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto]] is the official workplace of the [[president of Brazil]]. It is located at the [[Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes]] in Bras\u00edlia. As the [[Politics of Brazil|seat of government]], the term \"Planalto\" is often used as a [[metonym]] for the executive branch of government. The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto. The President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the [[Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada]]. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the \"Planalto\", including the [[Vice-President of Brazil]] and the [[Chief of Staff of Brazil|Chief of Staff]]. The other Ministries are along the [[Monumental Axis|Esplanada dos Minist\u00e9rios]]. The architect of the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto was [[Oscar Niemeyer]], creator of most of the important buildings in Bras\u00edlia. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:IB UnB.jpg|thumb|Institute of Biological Sciences (IB) of the [[University of Bras\u00edlia]]]]\n{{See also|Education in Brazil}}\n\nThe [[Portuguese language]] is the official national language and the primary language taught in schools.

Blue Streak was cancelled without entering full production.\n\nThe project was intended to maintain an independent British [[nuclear deterrent]], replacing the [[V bomber]] fleet which would become obsolete by 1965.  The operational requirement for the missile was issued in 1955 and the design was complete by 1957. However, during development it became clear that the missile system was too expensive and too vulnerable to a [[pre-emptive strike]].  The missile project was cancelled in 1960, with US-led [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]] the preferred replacement.\n\nPartly to avoid political embarrassment from the cancellation, the UK Government proposed that the rocket be used as the first stage of a civilian satellite launcher called [[Black Prince (rocket)|Black Prince]].  However, the cost was thought to be too great for the UK alone, and international collaboration was sought.  This led to the formation of the [[European Launcher Development Organisation]] (ELDO), with Blue Streak used as the first stage of a carrier rocket named [[Europa rocket|Europa]].\n\nEuropa was tested at [[Woomera Test Range]], Australia, and later at [[Guiana Space Centre|Kourou]] in French Guiana.  Following launch failures, the ELDO project was cancelled in 1972 and development of Blue Streak was halted.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\nPost-[[World War II|war]] Britain's [[nuclear weapon]]s armament was initially based on [[free-fall bomb]]s delivered by the [[V bomber]] force.  It soon became clear that if Britain wanted to have a credible [[nuclear deterrent]] threat, a ballistic missile was essential. There was a political need for an independent deterrent, so that Britain could remain a major [[world power]]. Britain was unable to purchase American weapons wholesale due to the restrictions of the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]].\n\nIn April 1954 the Americans proposed a joint development programme for ballistic missiles.  The United States would develop an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) of {{convert|5,000|nmi|km|adj=on}} range ([[SM-65 Atlas]]), while the United Kingdom with United States support would develop a [[medium-range ballistic missile]] (MRBM) of {{convert|2,000|nmi|km|adj=on}} range. The proposal was accepted as part of the [[Wilson-Sandys Agreement]] of August 1954, which provided for collaboration, exchange of information, and mutual planning of development programmes.  The decision to develop was influenced by what could be learnt about missile design and development in the US. Initial requirements for the [[booster (rocketry)|booster]] were made by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] at [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]] with input on the [[rocket engine]] design from the [[Rocket Propulsion Establishment]] at [[Westcott, Buckinghamshire|Westcott]].  British Operational Requirement 1139 demanded a rocket of at least 1500 [[nautical mile|n.m.]] range and the initially proposed rocket would have just reached that threshold.\n\n==Development==\nThe [[de Havilland Propellers]] company won the contract to build the missile, which was to be powered by an uprated liquid-fuelled [[Rocketdyne]] S3D engine, developed by [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], called [[RZ.2]].  Two variants of this engine were developed: the first provided a static [[thrust]] of {{convert|137000|lbf|kN|-1|abbr=on}} and the second (intended for the three stage [[satellite launch vehicle]]) {{convert|150000|lbf|kN|-1|abbr=on}}. The engines were unique at that time in that they could be [[Thrust vectoring|vectored]] by seven degrees in flight and could therefore be used to guide the vehicle. This configuration, however, put considerable pressure on the [[autopilot]] which had to cope with the problem of a vehicle whose weight was diminishing rapidly and that was steered by large engines whose thrust remained more or less constant. [[Vibration]] was also a problem, particularly at engine cut-off, and the later development of the autopilot for the satellite launcher was, in itself, a considerable achievement.\n\nSubcontractors included the [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]] who produced the [[missile guidance system]] whilst the [[nuclear warhead]] was designed by the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]].\n\nThe missiles used [[liquid oxygen]] and [[kerosene]] [[propellants]].  Whilst the vehicle could be left fully laden with over 20 tonnes of kerosene, the 60 tonnes of liquid oxygen had to be loaded immediately before launch or icing became a problem. Due to this, fuelling the rocket took 4.5 minutes, which would have made it useless as a rapid response to an attack.  The missile was vulnerable to a [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]], launched without warning or in the absence of any heightening of tension sufficient to warrant readying the missile.  To negate this problem de Havilland created a stand-by feature.  A missile could be held at 30 seconds' notice to launch for ten hours.  As the missiles were to be deployed in pairs and it took ten hours for one missile to be prepared for stand-by, one of the two missiles could always be ready for rapid launch.\n\nTo protect the missiles against a pre-emptive strike while being fuelled, the idea of siting the missiles in underground launchers was developed.  These would have been designed to withstand a one [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] blast at a distance of half a mile (800 m) and were a British innovation, subsequently exported to the United States. However, finding sites for these silos proved extremely difficult and [[RAF Spadeadam]] in [[Cumberland]] (now Cumbria) was the only site where construction was started on a full scale underground launcher, although test borings were undertaken at a number of other locations. The remains of this test silo, known as U1, were rediscovered by tree felling at Spadeadam. This was also the site where the RZ.2 rocket engines and also the complete Blue Streak missile were tested.  The best sites for silo construction were the more stable rock strata in parts of southern and north-east England and eastern Scotland, but the construction of many underground silos in the countryside carried enormous economic, social, and political costs. Development of the underground launchers presented  a major technical challenge.  1/60th and 1/6th scale models based on a \u2018U\u2019 shaped design were constructed and tested at RPE Westcott.  Three alternative designs were drawn up with one chosen as the prototype, designated K11.  [[RAF Upavon]] would appear to have been the preferred location for the prototype operational launcher with the former RNAS at Crail as the likely first operational site.\n\nIn 1955-1956, the rocket motors were test fired at [[The Needles Battery]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref>[http://www.redfunnel.co.uk/island-guide/places-to-visit/isle-of-wight-heritage-attractions/needles-rocket-testing-station/]</ref> As no site in Britain provided enough space for test flights, a test site was established at [[Woomera, South Australia]].\n\n==Cancellation as a military project==\nDoubts arose as the cost escalated from the first tentative figure of \u00a350 million submitted to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] in early 1955, to \u00a3300 million in late 1959. Its detractors in the civil service claimed that the programme was crawling along when compared with the speed of development in the US and the [[Soviet Union]]. {{Citation needed|reason=However considering the low base which Britain had started from the speed of the programme and its cost effectiveness were far greater than in any other nuclear nation.|date=September 2009}}\n\nEstimates within the Civil Service for completion of the project ranged from a total spend of \u00a3550 million to \u00a31.3 billion, as different ministers were set on either abandoning or continuing the project.\n\nThe project was unexpectedly canceled in April 1960.<ref name=\"ley196406\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=June 1964\n |title=Anyone Else for Space?\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v22n05_1964-06_modified#page/n69/mode/2up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=110-128\n |type=\n}}</ref> Whitehall opposition grew, and it was canceled on the ostensible grounds that it would be too vulnerable to a first-strike attack. Admiral of the Fleet [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] had spent considerable effort arguing that the project should be cancelled at once in favour of the Navy being armed with nuclear weapons, capable of pre-emptive strike.\n\nSome{{who|date=January 2016}} considered the cancellation of Blue Streak to be not only a blow to British military-industrial efforts, but also to [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] ally Australia, which had its own vested interest{{clarification needed|date=September 2018}} in the project.\n\nThe British military transferred its hopes for a strategic nuclear delivery system to the Anglo-American [[Skybolt missile]], before the project's cancellation by the United States as its ICBM programme reached maturity. The British instead purchased the [[Polaris missile|Polaris]] system from the Americans, carried in British-built [[submarine]]s.\n\n==Civilian programmes - Black Prince and ELDO==\nAfter the cancellation as a military project, there was reluctance to cancel the project because of the huge cost incurred. Blue Streak would have become the first stage of a projected all British satellite launcher known as \"[[Black Prince (rocket)|Black Prince]]\": the second stage was derived from the ''[[Black Knight (rocket)|Black Knight]]'' test vehicle, and the orbital injection stage was a small hydrogen peroxide/kerosene motor.\n\nBlack Prince proved too expensive for the UK, and the [[European Launcher Development Organisation]] (ELDO) was set up. This used Blue Streak as the first stage, with French and German second and third stages. The Blue Streak first stage was successfully tested three times at the [[Woomera Prohibited Area|Woomera test range]] in Australia as part of the ELDO programme.\n\n=== Black Prince ===\n{{main|Black Prince (rocket)}}\nIn 1959, a year before the cancellation of the Blue Streak as a missile, the government requested that the RAE and [[Saunders-Roe]] design a carrier rocket based on Blue Streak and Black Knight. This design used Blue Streak as a first stage and a 54-inch (137 centimetre) second stage based on the Black Knight.<ref name=\"p124\">Hill, p. 124</ref> Several different third stages would be available, depending on the required payload and orbit.\n\nThe cost of developing Black Prince was estimated to be [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]35 million.\n\nIt was planned that Black Prince would be a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] project. However, since the government of [[John Diefenbaker]] in Canada was already spending more money than publicly acknowledged on [[Alouette 1|Alouette]] and Australia was not interested in the project, these two countries were unwilling to contribute. South Africa was no longer a member of the Commonwealth. New Zealand was only likely to make \"modest\" contributions.<ref name=\"p126\">Hill, p. 126</ref>\n\n===European Launcher Development Organisation===\n{{main |European Launcher Development Organisation|Europa rocket}}\n[[File:Blue Streak rocket remains.jpg|thumb|The placard reads: \"Remains of the first Blue Streak rocket launched from Woomera 5 June 1964.  Discovered 50km SE of Giles in 1980.\"]]\nThe UK instead proposed a collaboration with other European countries to build a three-stage launcher capable of placing a one-ton payload into low [[Earth orbit]]. \nConsisting of Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, with Australia as an associate member.\n\nPreliminary work began in 1962 and ELDO was formally signed into existence in 1964.\n\nWith Blue Streak, the UK became the first stage of the European launch vehicle with France providing the [[Coralie]] second stage and Germany the third. Italy worked on the satellite project, the Netherlands and Belgium concentrated on tracking and telemetry systems and Australia supplied the launch site.\n\nThe combined launcher was named [[Europa rocket|Europa]].\n\nAfter ten test launches, the Woomera launch site was not suitable for putting satellites into geosynchronous orbit, and in 1966 it was decided to move to the French site of [[Kourou]] in [[South America]]. F11 was fired from here in November 1971, but the failure of the autopilot caused the vehicle to break up. The launch of F12 was postponed whilst a project review was carried out, which led to the decision to abandon the [[Europa (rocket)|Europa]] design.\n\nELDO was merged with the [[European Space Research Organisation]] to form the [[European Space Agency]].\n\n====List of Blue Streak launches as part of ELDO====\n(Taken from the \"Europa SLV Historiograph\", produced by HSD Ltd)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Although this seemed logical, the development costs proved to be too high for the limited budget of the programme.<ref name=\"p119\">Hill, p. 119</ref>\n\n===Westland Helicopters Black Arrow===\n{{main|Black Arrow}}\n\nFollowing its merger with Saunders Roe, [[Westland Helicopters]] developed the three-stage Black Arrow satellite carrier rocket, derived from the [[Black Knight (rocket)|Black Knight]] test vehicle. The first stage of Black Arrow was given the same diameter as the French Coralie (the second stage of Europa) in order to make it compatible with Blue Streak. Using Blue Streak as an additional stage would have increased Black Arrow's payload capacity. To maintain this compatibility, the first stage diameter was given in metres, although the rest of the rocket was defined in imperial units.\n\nBlack Arrow carried out four test launches (without an additional Blue Streak stage) from Woomera between 1969 and 1971, with the final launch carrying the satellite [[Prospero X-3]] into orbit. The United Kingdom remains the only country to have successfully developed and then abandoned a satellite launch capability.\n\n===Hawker Siddeley Dynamics proposal===\nIn 1972, [[Hawker Siddeley Dynamics]] (HSD) produced a brochure for a design using Blue Streak as the first stage of a [[two-stage to orbit]] rocket, with an American [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stage. The Centaur second stage would have either been built in the UK under licence or imported directly from the USA. Both the Centaur and Blue Streak had proved to be very reliable up to this point, and since they were both already designed development costs would have been low.

It consists of a number of low-lying, largely mangrove covered islands covering an area of around 665&nbsp;km\u00b2 (257&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). The population of Bakassi is the subject of some dispute, but is generally put at between 150,000 and 300,000 people.\n\nBakassi is situated at the extreme eastern end of the Gulf of Guinea, where the warm east-flowing [[Guinea Current]] (called Aya Efiat in [[Efik language|Efik]]) meets the cold north-flowing [[Benguela Current]] (called Aya Ubenekang in Efik). These two ocean currents interact, creating huge foamy breakers which constantly advance towards the shore, and building submarine shoals rich in fish, shrimps, and a wide variety of other marine life forms. This makes the Bakassi area a very fertile fishing ground, comparable only to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in North America and [[Scandinavia]] in Western Europe. Most of the population make their living through fishing.\n\nThe peninsula is commonly described as \"oil-rich\", though in fact no commercially viable deposits of oil have been discovered. However, the area has aroused considerable interest from oil companies in the light of the discovery of rich reserves of high grade [[crude oil]] in Nigeria. At least eight multinational oil companies have participated in the exploration of the peninsula and its offshore waters. In October 2012, [[China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation]] announced it had discovered new oil and gas resources in the Bakassi region.<ref>[http://www.menafn.com/menafn/46121fb4-d997-47a3-b228-ba8526460fc5/Addax-Petroleum-Discovers-New-Oil-Gas-Resources-Cameroon?src=main Addax Petroleum Discovers New Oil, Gas Resources in Cameroon], ''MenaFN.com'', 10 October 2012</ref>\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[Scramble for Africa]], [[Queen Victoria]] signed a Treaty of Protection with the King and Chiefs of [[Akwa Akpa]], known to Europeans as [[Old Calabar]] on 10 September 1884. This enabled the [[British Empire]] to exercise control over the entire territory around Calabar, including Bakassi. The territory subsequently became ''de facto'' part of  [[Nigeria]], although the border was never permanently delineated.  However, documents released by the Cameroonians, in parity with that of the British and Germans, clearly places Bakassi under Cameroonian Territory as a consequence of colonial era Anglo-German agreements. After [[Southern Cameroons]] voted in 1961 to leave Nigeria and became a part of Cameroon, Bakassi remained under [[Calabar]] administration in Nigeria until ICJ judgement of 2002.<ref>Nowa Omoigui, [http://www.omoigui.com/files/the_bakassi_story.pdf The Bakassi Story], ''Omoigui.com''</ref>\n\n==Population==\nBakassi inhabitants are mainly the Oron people, the people of [[Cross River State]] and [[Akwa Ibom State]] of Nigeria.\n\n==Territorial dispute==\nNigeria and Cameroon have disputed the possession of Bakassi for some years, leading to considerable tension between the two countries. In 1981 the two countries went to the brink of war over Bakassi and another area around [[Lake Chad]], at the other end of the two countries' common border. More armed clashes broke out in the early 1990s. In response, Cameroon took the matter to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) on 29 March 1994.<ref>Bola A. Akinterinwa, [http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/earticles/equatorial_guinea_and_the_bakass.htm Equatorial Guinea and the Bakassi Dispute], ''Nigerdeltacongress.com'', April 2002</ref>\n\nThe case was extremely complex, requiring the court to review diplomatic exchanges dating back over 100 years. Nigeria relied largely on Anglo-German correspondence dating from 1885 as well as treaties between the colonial powers and the indigenous rulers in the area, particularly the 1884 Treaty of Protection. Cameroon pointed to the Anglo-German treaty of 1913, which defined [[sphere of influence|sphere of control]] in the region, as well as two agreements signed in the 1970s between Cameroon and Nigeria. These were the Yaound\u00e9 II Declaration of 4 April 1971 and the [[Maroua Declaration]] of 1 June 1975, which were devised to outline [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] between the two countries following their independence. The line was drawn through the Cross River estuary to the west of the peninsula, thereby implying Cameroonian ownership over Bakassi. However, Nigeria never ratified the agreement, while Cameroon regarded it as being in force.\n\n===ICJ verdict===\nThe ICJ delivered its judgment on 10 October 2002, finding (based principally on the Anglo-German agreements) that sovereignty over Bakassi did indeed rest with Cameroon. It instructed Nigeria to transfer possession of the peninsula, but did not require the inhabitants to move or to change their nationality. Cameroon was thus given a substantial Nigerian population and was required to protect their rights, infrastructure and welfare.<ref>Mike Chinedu Anekwe, [http://nigeriaworld.com/articles/2002/dec/273.html ICJ ruling on Bakassi: Matters arising], ''Nigeriaworld.com'', 27 December 2002</ref>\n\nThe verdict caused consternation in Nigeria. It aroused vitriolic comments from Nigerian officials and the Nigerian media alike. Chief [[Richard Akinjide]], a former Nigerian Attorney-General and Minister of Justice who had been a leading member of Nigeria's legal team, described the decision as \"50% international law and 50% international politics\", \"blatantly biased and unfair\", \"a total disaster\", and a \"complete fraud\". The Nigerian newspaper ''[[The Guardian (Nigeria)|The Guardian]]'' went further, declaring that the judgment was \"a rape and unforeseen potential international conspiracy against Nigerian territorial integrity and sovereignty\" and \"part of a Western ploy to foment and perpetuate trouble in Africa\". The outcome of the controversy was a ''de facto'' Nigerian refusal to withdraw its troops from Bakassi and transfer sovereignty. The Nigerian government did not, however, openly reject the judgment but instead called for an agreement that would provide \"peace with honour, with the interest and welfare of our people.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2002/10/30/20021030news03.html |accessdate=18 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813003633/http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2002/10/30/20021030news03.html |archivedate=13 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe ICJ judgment was backed up by the [[United Nations]], whose charter potentially allowed sanctions or even the use of force to enforce the court's ruling. [[Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] stepped in as a mediator and chaired a tripartite summit with the two countries' presidents on 15 November 2002, which established a commission to facilitate the peaceful implementation of the ICJ's judgement. A further summit was held on 31 January 2004.

Originating in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], bestiaries were made popular in the [[Middle Ages]] in illustrated volumes that described various animals and even rocks. The [[natural history]] and illustration of each beast was usually accompanied by a moral lesson. This reflected the belief that the world itself was the Word of God, and that every living thing had its own special meaning. For example, the [[pelican]], which was believed to tear open its breast to bring its young to life with its own blood, was a living representation of [[Jesus]]. The bestiary, then, is also a reference to the [[symbol]]ic language of [[animals in Christian art|animals in Western Christian art]] and literature.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest bestiary in the form in which it was later popularized was an anonymous 2nd century [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] volume called the ''[[Physiologus]]'', which itself summarized ancient knowledge and wisdom about animals in the writings of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]'' and various works by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Solinus]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] and other naturalists.\n\nFollowing the ''Physiologus'', Saint [[Isidore of Seville]] (Book XII of the ''[[Etymologiae]]'') and [[Saint Ambrose]] expanded the religious message with reference to passages from the [[Bible]] and the [[Septuagint]]. They and other authors freely expanded or modified pre-existing models, constantly refining the moral content without interest or access to much more detail regarding the factual content. Nevertheless, the often fanciful accounts of these beasts were widely read and generally believed to be true. A few observations found in bestiaries, such as the [[Bird migration|migration]] of birds, were discounted by the natural philosophers of later centuries, only to be rediscovered in the modern scientific era.\n\nMedieval bestiaries are remarkably similar in sequence of the animals of which they treat. Bestiaries were particularly popular in [[England]] and [[France]] around the 12th century and were mainly compilations of earlier texts. The [[Aberdeen Bestiary]] is one of the best known of over 50 manuscript bestiaries surviving today.\n\nBestiaries influenced early [[heraldry]] in the Middle Ages, giving ideas for [[charge (heraldry)|charges]] and also for the artistic form. Bestiaries continue to give inspiration to coats of arms created in our time.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Friar|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location=London|year=1987|publisher=[[A & C Black|Alphabooks/A&C Black]]|isbn=0 906670 44 6|page=342}}</ref>\n\nTwo illuminated [[Psalter]]s, the [[Queen Mary Psalter]] ([[British Library]] Ms. Royal 2B, vii) and the [[Isabella Psalter]] (State Library, [[Munich]]), contain full Bestiary cycles. The bestiary in the Queen Mary Psalter is found in the \"marginal\" decorations that occupy about the bottom quarter of the page, and are unusually extensive and coherent in this work. In fact the bestiary has been expanded beyond the source in the Norman bestiary of Guillaume le Clerc to ninety animals. Some are placed in the text to make correspondences with the [[psalm]] they are illustrating.<ref>The Queen Mary psalter: a study of affect and audience By Anne Rudloff Stanton, p44ff, Diane Publishing</ref>\n\nThe Italian artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also made his own bestiary.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Selections from the Bestiary of Leonardo da Vinci | first1=Oliver |last1=Evans |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=64 |number=254 |date=Oct\u2013Dec 1951 |pages=393\u2013396 |jstor=537007 }}</ref>\n\nA ''volucrary'' is a similar collection of the symbols of birds that is sometimes found in conjunction with bestiaries. The most widely known volucrary in the Renaissance was [[Johannes de Cuba]]'s ''Gart der Gesundheit''<ref>{{cite book|last1=de Cuba|first1=Jean|title=Garden Of Health|date=1501|publisher=Verard Antoine (Paris)|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b2100150b|archiveurl=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb386198123|archivedate=2007|language=French|format=758 scanned pages with black & white illustrations}}</ref> which describes 122 birds and which was printed in 1485.<ref>''Hortus sanitatis deutsch.'' Mainz (Peter Sch\u00f6ffer) 1485; Neudrucke M\u00fcnchen 1924 and 1966.</ref>\n\n==Bestiary content==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nMedieval bestiaries often contained detailed descriptions and illustrations of species native to Western Europe, exotic animals and what in modern times are considered to be imaginary animals. Descriptions of the animals included the physical characteristics associated with the creature, although these were often physiologically incorrect, along with the Christian morals that the animal represented. The description was then normally followed with an artistic illustration of the animal as described in the bestiary.\n\nBestiaries were organized in different ways based upon the text. The descriptions could be organized by animal groupings, such as terrestrial and marine creatures, or presented in an alphabetical manner. However, the texts gave no distinction between existing and imaginary animals. Descriptions of creatures such as [[dragon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[basilisk]], [[griffin]] and [[caladrius]] were common in such works and found intermingled amongst accounts of bears, boars, deer, lions, and elephants.\n\nThis lack of separation has often been associated with the assumption that people during this time believed in what the modern period classifies as nonexistent or \"[[imaginary creatures]]\". However, this assumption is currently under debate, with various explanations being offered.\n\nSome scholars, such as Pamela Gravestock, have written on the theory that medieval people did not actually think such creatures existed but instead focused on the belief in the importance of the Christian morals these creatures represented, and that the importance of the moral did not change regardless if the animal existed or not.\n\nThe contents of medieval bestiaries were often obtained and created from combining older textual sources and accounts of animals, such as the ''[[Physiologus]]'', with newer observations and writings. In this way, the content of such written works was constantly added to and built upon.\n\n==Modern bestiaries==\nIn modern times, artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Saul Steinberg]] have produced their own bestiaries. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote a contemporary bestiary of sorts, the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]'', which collects imaginary beasts from bestiaries and fiction.

It is one of the few popular songs of the Vietnam War years to cast the military in a positive light and in 1966 became a major hit, reaching No. 1 for five weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and four weeks on [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]. Ultimately, the song was named [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1966|Billboard's #1 single for the year 1966]].  It was also a crossover smash, reaching No. 1 on ''Billboard's'' Easy Listening chart and No. 2 on ''Billboard's'' Country survey.\n\nThe song was written by then [[Staff Sergeant|Staff Sgt.]] [[Barry Sadler]], beginning when he was training to be a Special Forces medic. The author Robin Moore, who wrote the book, ''The Green Berets'', helped Sadler write the lyrics and get a recording contract with RCA Records.\n\nThe lyrics were written, in part, in honor of Green Beret U.S. Army Specialist 5 James Gabriel, Jr., the first [[native Hawaiian]] to die in Vietnam, who was killed by Viet Cong gunfire while on a training mission with the South Vietnamese Army on April 8, 1962.<ref>{{cite web | last=Mizutani | first=Ron | title=First Native Hawaiian Killed in Vietnam Conflict Honored | date=May 18, 2010 | work=KHON2.com | publisher=[[KHON-TV]] | url=http://www.khon2.com/content/news/developingstories/story/First-Native-Hawaiian-Killed-in-Vietnam-Conflict/iSrtWYe-DEmrkW4dYH_m2Q.cspx | accessdate=March 12, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616211947/http://www.khon2.com/content/news/developingstories/story/First-Native-Hawaiian-Killed-in-Vietnam-Conflict/iSrtWYe-DEmrkW4dYH_m2Q.cspx | archivedate=June 16, 2011 | df= }}</ref> One verse mentioned Gabriel by name, but it was not used in the recorded version.<ref>''I'm a Lucky One'' by Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler (Macmillan 1967, pp.&nbsp;80\u201381)</ref>\n\nSadler recorded the song and eleven other tunes in New York in December 1965. The song and album, \"Ballads of the Green Berets,\" were released in January 1966. He performed the song on television on January 30, 1966 on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', and on other TV shows including ''Hollywood Palace'' and ''The Jimmy Dean Show''.\n\n== Popularity ==\nThe song was the No. 1 hit in the U.S. for the five weeks, spanning March 1966 and the No. 1 hit on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' end of the year chart for 1966; also the No. 21 song of the 1960s as ranked by [[Joel Whitburn]]. The single sold more than nine million copies; the album, more than two million. \n\n\"The Ballad of the Green Berets\" is currently used as one of the four primary [[marching band|marching tunes]] of the [[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band]].\n\n== In film ==\nThe song is heard in a choral rendition by [[Ken Darby]] in the 1968 [[John Wayne]] film, ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'', based on [[Robin Moore]]'s book. The film's score was not released as an album until ''[[Film Score Monthly]]'' released it in 2005. A movie [[tie-in]] featuring artwork from the film and a [[cover version]] by [[Ennio Morricone]] was released in Europe, though the album's other tracks were from ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' and ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''.\n\nThe song appears in the films ''[[More American Graffiti]]'' and ''[[Canadian Bacon]]''. It can also be heard in the gun show scene of the 2002 film ''[[Showtime (film)|Showtime]]'', and in the film ''[[Jesus' Son]]'', in a scene that features a hitch-hiking [[Jack Black]].\n\nA vinyl copy of \"The Ballad of the Green Berets\" makes a brief appearance in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Homer's Phobia]]\", from the show's eighth season. Guest star and filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] is seen near the five-minute mark flipping through Homer and Marge's record collection; Sadler's hit is amongst them.\n\nBill Murray briefly sang \"Green Berets\" in the 1980 film ''[[Caddyshack]]'' during his final attempt to kill the gopher.\n\nThe cast of the 2018 movie ''[[12 Strong]]'' sing the tune as their Chinook helicopter takes off.\n\n== Covers and derivatives ==\nMany American [[cover version]]s of the song appeared recorded by artists ranging from [[Kate Smith]] and [[Duane Eddy]] to unknown artists singing on various [[drugstore records]].\n\nThe punk rock band [[The F.U.'s]] performed a cover of the song, featured on the album ''[[This Is Boston, Not L.A.]]''\n\nMany cover versions are in different languages rewritten to reference local units; these include:\n* A German version (''Hundert Mann und ein Befehl''), sung by [[Freddy Quinn]] and later again by [[Heidi Br\u00fchl]] had considerable success in [[Germany]]. The German version is a song ''against'' the war. It rejects any sacrifice, not only for the son, but for the father as well. [[Freddy Quinn]] sings the song from the point of view of the reluctant but forced soldier,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Heidi Bruhl from the point of view of the crying girlfriend of the soldier.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Freddy Quinn's version was later cover by [[Welle: Erdball]] and also by [[Cryptic Wintermoon]].\n* The Royal Netherlands Army's [[Korps Commandotroepen]] (KCT) use the original lyrics. The only difference is that in the chorus, instead of singing \"''These are men, America's best''\", they sing \"''These are men, The Netherlands' best''\". Also in the final chorus, referring to the son of a deceased Green Beret, they sing \"''Make him one of The Netherlands' best''\". This version of the original ballad is sung to recruits who have successfully completed the harsh Basic Commando Training (ECO), and who receive their Green Beret.\n* [[Rhodesian]] singer-songwriter [[John Edmond]] recorded the \"Ballad of the Green Berets\" with reference to the soldiers of the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (RLI), commando-style [[fireforce]] units of Rhodesian Security Forces who wore [[berets]] of [[green]] [[color]]. A \"Ballad of the Red Beret\" was sung by the Rhodesian Ministry of Internal Affairs at their battlecamp in [[Chikurubi]]. In [[South Africa]], the \"Ballad of the Green Berets\" was recorded as the \"Ballad of the Maroon Berets\". The [[Maroon beret]] is a symbol of the [[South African Special Forces Brigade]] and the [[South African 44 Parachute Regiment]]. Also this song was re-recorded by South African opera singer Leonore Veenemans as \"My Land Suid-Afrika\".\n* The Swedish version \"Balladen om den bl\u00e5 baskern\" is a salute to the Swedish soldiers serving in the United Nations' peace-keeping forces (the Blue Berets). It was sung by [[Anita Lindblom]].\n* The Italian version is called ''La Ballata del Soldato'', sung by [[Quartetto Cetra]].\n* In the [[Swiss Armed Forces]], the Infantry Officer's School uses a [[Languages of Switzerland|quadrlingual]] version (named The [[Infantry]] Ballad) of the song as their anthem, in salute to the bonds created by the very harsh training undertaken by the cadets as well as to the sense of duty (and their motto, [[Exemplo Ducemus]]) they vow to respect. It is sung everyday onwards to the morning [[wikt:roll call|roll call]], before the [[National anthem of Switzerland|National Anthem]].\n* In 1966, Bernard Tapy (real name [[Bernard Tapie]], businessman and politician), recorded an adaptation in French as \"Passeport pour le soleil\"<ref>[http://www.encyclopedisque.fr/disque/23082.html \u226aPasseport pour le soleil.

The record was withdrawn after a [[cease and desist]] letter from Sadler.\n* [[The Residents]] parodied the song on their ''[[Third Reich & Roll]]'' album.\n* Another parody was used on an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' that [[William Shatner]] hosted in 1986, called \"Ollie North, The Mute Marine\". Shatner participated in the sketch, outfitted in a USMC Class A uniform, alluding to [[Oliver North]]'s refusal to speak about his participation in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]; Shatner spoke no words.\n* The song is used to humorous effect in [[Michael Moore]]'s film ''[[Canadian Bacon (film)|Canadian Bacon]]'' as ill-informed Americans prepare for an invasion by [[Canada]].\n* The movie ''[[Wag the Dog]]'' includes the fictitious unit 303 Special Forces' song \"The Men of the 303\", which is played to a similar but original tune written by [[Huey Lewis]] for the film.\n* In the film ''[[Caddyshack]]'', Carl Spackler, played by [[Bill Murray]], mumbles the song under his breath while he is connecting the wires to the plunger as he prepares for his final battle with his [[gopher (animal)|gopher]] nemesis.\n* Comedian Paul Shanklin parodied the song with \"Ballad of the Black Beret\", referring to the Clinton sex scandal, on his 1999 album ''[[Simply Reprehensible]]''.\n* Though its usage was not a parody, in an episode of ''[[Cheers]]'', Cliff Clavin aborts his plans to emigrate to Canada with his love interest when Sam, Woody, and Frasier appeal to his patriotic side by singing the song.\n*  The internet critic SF Debris uses the music with lyrics about the Red Shirts in ''Star Trek'' who regularly die on away missions.\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" \n|-\n!

Playford only gives the floor patterns of the dances, with no indication of the steps. However, other sources of the period, such as the writings of the French dancing-masters [[Raoul Auger Feuillet|Feuillet]] and Lorin, indicate that steps more complicated than simple walking were used at least some of the time.\n\nEnglish country dance survived well beyond the Baroque era and eventually spread in various forms across Europe and its colonies, and to all levels of society.\n\n== The French Noble style ==\n{{Further|French ballet}}\n[[Image:Ballet de la nuit 1653.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A costume design for Louis XIV as The Rising Sun, from the final entr\u00e9e of ''[[Ballet de la Nuit|Le Ballet de la Nuit]]'' (1653)]]\nThe great innovations in dance in the 17th century originated at the French court under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], and it is here that we see the first clear stylistic ancestor of [[classical ballet]].  The same basic technique was used both at social events, and as theatrical dance in court ballets and at public theaters.  The style of dance is commonly known to modern scholars as the ''French noble style'' or ''belle danse'' (French, literally \"beautiful dance\"), however it is often referred to casually as ''baroque dance'' in spite of the existence of other theatrical and social dance styles during the baroque era.\n\nPrimary sources include more than three hundred choreographies in [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]],<ref>Little, Meredith Ellis and Marsh, Carol G. ''La Danse Noble, An Inventory of Dances and Sources'', (Broude Brothers Ltd, 1992) {{ISBN|0-8450-0092-6}}</ref><ref>Lancelot, Francine, ''La Belle Dance: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9'', (Van Dieren Editeur, 1996) {{ISBN|2-911087-02-X}}</ref> as well as manuals by [[Raoul Handsome Auger Feuillet]] and [[Pierre Rameau]] in France, [[Kellom Tomlinson]] and [[John Weaver (dancer)|John Weaver]] in England, and [[Gottfried Taubert]] in Germany.  This wealth of evidence has allowed modern scholars and dancers to recreate the style, although areas of controversy still exist.  The standard modern introduction is Hilton.<ref>Hilton, Wendy, ''Dance and Music of Court and Theater: Selected Writings of Wendy Hilton'' (Pendragon Press, 1997) {{ISBN|0-945193-98-X}}</ref>\n\nFrench dance types include:\n* [[Allemande]]\n* [[Bourr\u00e9e]]\n* [[Canarie (dance)|Canarie]] (canary)\n* [[Chaconne]]\n* [[Courante|(French) courante]]\n* [[Entr\u00e9e grave]]\n* [[Forlane]] (forlana)\n* [[Gavotte]]\n* [[Gigue]]\n* [[Loure]] (slow gigue)\n* [[Minuet|Menuet]] (minuet)\n* [[Bal-musette|Musette]]\n* [[Passacaglia|Passacaille]] (passacaglia)\n* [[Passepied]]\n* [[Rigaudon]]\n* [[Sarabande]]\n* [[Tambourin]]\n\nThe English, working in the French style, added their own [[hornpipe]] to this list.\n\nMany of these dance types are familiar from [[European classical music|baroque music]], perhaps most spectacularly in the stylized [[suite (music)|suite]]s of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]].<ref>Little, Meredith and Jenne, Natalie. ''Dance and the Music of J.S. Bach'' (Indiana University Press, 1991, 2001) {{ISBN|0-253-21464-5}}</ref> Note, however, that the [[allemande]]s, that occur in these suites do not correspond to a French dance from the same period.\n\n== Theatrical dance ==\nThe French noble style was danced both at social events and by professional dancers in theatrical productions such as opera-ballets and court entertainments. However, 18th-century theatrical dance had at least two other styles: comic or grotesque, and semi-serious.<ref>Fairfax, Edmund. ''The Styles of Eighteenth-Century Ballet'' (Scarecrow Press, 2003) {{ISBN|0-8108-4698-5}}</ref><ref>Harris-Warrick, Rebecca and Brown, Bruce Alan, editors. ''The Grotesque Dancer on the Eighteenth Century Stage'' (The University of Wisconsin Press, 2005) {{ISBN|0-299-20354-9}}</ref>\n\n== Other social dance styles ==\nOther dance styles, such as the Italian and Spanish dances of the period are much less well studied than either English country dance or the French style.  The general picture seems to be that during most of the 17th century, a style of late [[Renaissance dance]] was widespread, but as time progressed, French ballroom dances such as the minuet were widely adopted at fashionable courts. Beyond this, the evolution and cross-fertilisation of dance styles is an area of ongoing research.\n\n== Modern reconstructions ==\n[[File:Historical dancing baroque at time travellers ball earthly delights dance group.JPG|thumb|Young ladies enjoying a Time Travelers' Ball \u2013 dances from the 15th to early 20th century including Baroque]]\nThe revival of baroque music in the 1960s and '70s sparked renewed interest in 17th and 18th century dance styles. While some 300 of these dances had been preserved in [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]], it wasn't until the mid-20th century that serious scholarship commenced in deciphering the notation and reconstructing the dances.\n\nPerhaps best known among these pioneers was Britain's Melusine Wood, who published several books on historical dancing in the 1950s.<ref>Wood, Melusine, ''More Historical Dances'', (Imperial Soc. Dancing, 1956) {{ISBN|0-900484-12-8}}</ref> Wood passed her research on to her student Belinda Quirey, and also to Pavlova Company ballerina and choreographer Mary Skeaping (1902\u20131984). The latter became well known for her reconstructions of baroque ballets for London's \"Ballet for All\" company in the 1960s.\n\nThe leading figures of the second generation of historical dance research include Shirley Wynne and her Baroque Dance Ensemble which was founded at Ohio State University in the early 1970s and Wendy Hilton (1931\u20132002), a student of Belinda Quirey  who supplemented the work of Melusine Wood with her own research into original sources.<ref>Hilton, Wendy, ''Dance of Court and Theater: The French Noble Style 1690-1725'' (Princeton Book Company, 1981) {{ISBN|0-916622-09-6}}</ref>\nA native of Britain, Hilton arrived in the U.S. in 1969 joining the faculty of the [[Juilliard School]] in 1972 and establishing her own baroque dance workshop at [[Stanford University]] in 1974 which endured for more than 25 years.\n\nCatherine Turocy (b. circa 1950) began her studies in Baroque dance in 1971 as a student of dance historian Shirley Wynne. She founded [[The New York Baroque Dance Company]] in 1976 with Ann Jacoby, and the company has since toured internationally. In 1982/83 as part of the French national celebration of Jean Philippe Rameau's 300th birthday, Turocy choreographed the first production of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''Les Bor\u00e9ades'' - it was never performed during the composer's lifetime.  This French supported production with John Eliot Gardiner, conductor, and his orchestra was directed by Jean Louis Martinoty. Turocy has been decorated as Chevalier in the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French government.\n\nIn 1973, French dance historian [[Francine Lancelot]] (1929\u20132003) began her formal studies in ethnomusicology which later led her to research French traditional dance forms and eventually Renaissance and Baroque dances. In 1980, at the invitation of the French Minister of Culture, she founded the baroque dance company \"Ris et Danceries\". Her work in choreographing the landmark 1986 production of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s 1676 tragedie-lyrique ''[[Atys (Lully)|Atys]]'' was part of the national celebration of the 300th anniversary of Lully's death.  This production propelled the career of [[William Christie (musician)|William Christie]] and his ensemble [[Les Arts Florissants (ensemble)|Les Arts Florissants]].

Descended from dogs brought to Russia from central Asian countries, it is similar in shape to a [[greyhound]], and is also a member of the [[sighthound]] family.\n\nThe system by which Russians over the ages named their sighthounds was a series of descriptive terms, not actual names. \"[[:wiktionary:ru:\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0437\u044b\u0439|Borz\u00f3i]]\" is the masculine singular form of an archaic Russian adjective that means \"fast\". \"Borz\u00e1ya sob\u00e1ka\" (\"fast dog\") is the basic term used by Russians, though \"sob\u00e1ka\" is usually dropped. The name \"Psovaya\" derived from the word Psovina, which means \"wavy, silky coat\", just as \"Hortaya\" (as in [[Hortaya Borzaya]]) means shorthaired. In Russia today the breed we know as the borzoi is officially known as \"Russkaya Psovaya Borzaya\". Other Russian sighthound breeds are \"Stepnaya Borzaya\" (from the [[steppe]]), called \"Stepnoi\"; and \"Krimskaya Borzaya\" (from the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]), called \"Krimskoi\".\n\nThe most commonly used plural form is the regular formation \"borzois\", which is the only plural cited in most dictionaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/borzoi?s=t |title=Borzoi &#124; Define Borzoi at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/borzoi?q=borzoi |title=borzoi: definition of borzoi in Oxford dictionary (British & World English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref> However, the Borzoi Club of America and the Borzoi Club UK<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theborzoiclub.org.uk/ |title=theborzoiclub.org.uk |publisher=theborzoiclub.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref> both prefer \"borzoi\" as the form for both singular and plural forms.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Medalowy borgoj.jpg|thumb|left|Borzoi, red coat]]\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nBorzois are large Russian [[sighthound]]s that resemble some central Asian breeds such as the [[Afghan hound]], [[Saluki]], and the [[Taigan|Kyrgyz Taigan]]. Borzois can generally be described as \"long-haired [[greyhound]]s\".  Borzois come in virtually any colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/borzoi/color_markings.cfm|title=Borzoi Colors and Markings|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> The borzoi coat is silky and flat, often wavy or slightly curly. The long top-coat is  quite flat, with varying degrees of waviness or curling. The soft undercoat thickens during winter or in cold climates, but is shed in hot weather to prevent overheating. In its texture and distribution over the body, the borzoi coat is unique. There should be a frill on its neck, as well as feathering on its hindquarters and tail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borzoiclubofamerica.org/stand.htm|title=The Borzoi Standard|publisher=Borzoi Club of America|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nBorzoi males frequently weigh more than {{convert|100|lb|kg}}.

Most borzois are fairly quiet, barking on rare occasions. They do not have strong territorial drives and cannot be relied on to raise the alarm upon sighting a human intruder. The borzoi requires patient, experienced handling. They are gentle and highly sensitive dogs with a natural respect for humans, and as adults they are decorative couch potatoes with remarkably gracious house manners. Borzois do not generally display dominance or aggression towards people, but can turn aggressive if handled roughly. Typically, they are rather reserved with strangers but affectionate with people they know well. Their sensitivity to invasion of their personal space can make them nervous around children unless they are brought up with them. Borzois adapt very well to [[suburb]]an life, provided they have a spacious yard and regular opportunities for free exercise.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nA common misunderstanding about the intelligence of breeds in the [[Hound]] group stems from their independent nature, which conflicts with the frequent confusion between the concepts of \"intelligence\" and \"obedience\" in discussions of canine brainpower. [[Stanley Coren]]'s survey of canine obedience trainers published in ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'' reported that borzois obeyed the first command less than 25% of the time. Coren's test, however, was by his own admission heavily weighted towards the \"obedience\" interpretation of intelligence and based on a better understanding of \"working\" breeds than hounds. Unfortunately, the publicity given to this report has led to unfair denigration of breeds which are under-represented in obedience clubs and poorly understood by the average obedience trainer.<ref>At a Conformation Judges training session not long after Coren's book was released, I was greeted by the coordinator with the question, \"I read something that said Borzois aren't very smart, is that true?\" This to the owner of several borzois, one of which knows how to open the refrigerator, and all of which respond instantly to \"commands\" given in that special owner-dog private language that wouldn't even be noticed by an outsider.</ref> \"Work\" for hound breeds is done out of hearing and often out of sight of the human companion; it is an activity for which the dogs are \"released\", rather than an activity which is \"commanded\".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn terms of obedience, borzois are selective learners who quickly become bored with repetitive, apparently pointless, activity, and they can be very stubborn when they are not properly motivated. For example, food rewards, or \"baiting\", may work well for some individuals, but not at all for others. Nevertheless, borzois are definitely capable of enjoying and performing well in [[obedience trial|competitive obedience]] and [[dog agility|agility trials]] with the right kind of [[obedience training|training]].<ref>Scott pp.113</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Brunarski/Moyer |url=http://www.nktelco.net/teine/lyric.htm |title=lyric |publisher=Nktelco.net |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borzoiclubofamerica.org/ava.htm |title=Borzoi Club of America, Inc |publisher=Borzoiclubofamerica.org |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229040739/http://www.borzoiclubofamerica.org/ava.htm |archivedate=29 February 2012 |df= }}</ref> Like other sighthounds, they are very sensitive and do not cope well with harsh treatment or training based on punishment, and will be extremely unhappy if raised voices and threats are a part of their daily life. However, like any intelligent dog, borzois respond extremely well to the guidance, support, and clear communication of a benevolent human leadership.\n\nBorzois were bred to pursue or \"course\" game and have a powerful instinct to chase things that run from them, including cats and small dogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/borzoi.html|title=Borzoi Temperament - What's Good About 'Em, What's Bad About 'Em|publisher=Your Purebred Puppy|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> Built for speed and endurance, they can cover long distances in a very short time. A fully fenced yard is a necessity for maintaining any [[sighthound]]. They are highly independent and will range far and wide without containment, with little regard for road traffic. For off-leash exercise, a borzoi needs a very large field or park, either fully fenced or well away from any roads, to ensure its safety. <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Borzoi_in_flight.jpg|thumb|left|A young borzoi at a full run. This spectacular action comes in short bursts of activity; thirty minutes of off lead exercise a day is more than sufficient.]] -->\n\nBorzois are born with specialized coursing skills, but these are quite different from the dog-fighting instincts seen in some breeds. It is quite common for borzois at play to course (i.e., run down) another dog, seize it by the neck and hold it immobile. Young pups do this with their littermates, trading off as to who is the prey. It is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nBorzois can be raised very successfully to live with [[cat]]s and other small animals provided they are introduced to them when they are puppies. Some, however, will possess the hunting instinct to such a degree that they find it impossible not to chase a cat that is moving quickly. The hunting instinct is triggered by movement and much depends on how the cat behaves.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n== Health ==\n[[File:Borzoi-2ym-body.png|thumb|Borzois vary widely in colour]]\n\nStated life expectancy is 10 to 12 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzkc.org.nz/breed_info/br424.html|title=NZKC - Breed Standard - Borzoi|publisher=New Zealand Kennel Club|accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://animal.discovery.com/breed-selector/dog-breeds/hound/borzoi.html|title=Borzoi: Dog Breed Selector: Animal Planet|publisher=Animal Planet|accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref> Median lifespan based on a UK Kennel Club survey is 9 years 1 month. 1 in 5 died of old age, at an average of 10 to 11.5 years.

[[Osteochondritis dissecans|OCD]], [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip]] and [[elbow dysplasia]] have remained almost unknown, as were congenital eye and heart diseases before the 1970s. However, in some countries modern breeding practices have introduced a few problems.\n\nAs with other very deep-chested breeds, [[gastric dilatation volvulus]] (also known as bloat) is the most common serious health problem in the borzoi. This life-threatening condition is believed to be anatomical rather than strictly genetic in origin. One common recommendation in the past has been to raise the food bowl of the dog when it eats. However, studies have shown that this may actually increase the risk of bloat.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Glickman L, Glickman N, Schellenberg D, Raghavan M, Lee T |title=Non-dietary risk factors for gastric dilatation-volvulus in large and giant breed dogs |journal=J. Am. Vet. Med.

A controversy exists as to the presence of [[progressive retinal atrophy]] in the breed. A condition identified as borzoi retinopathy is seen in some individuals, usually active dogs, which differs from progressive retinal atrophy in several ways. First, it is unilateral, and rarely seen in animals less than three years of age; second, a clear-cut pattern of inheritance has not been demonstrated; and finally, most affected individuals do not go blind.\n\n[[File:Borzoi-2ym-head.png|thumb|right|Borzoi is basically a very sound breed.]]\nCorrect nutrition during puppyhood is also debatable for borzois. These dogs naturally experience enormous growth surges in the first year or two of their lives. It is now widely accepted that forcing even faster growth by feeding a highly concentrated, high-energy diet is dangerous for skeletal development, causing unsoundness and increased tendency to joint problems and injury. Being built primarily for speed, borzois do not carry large amounts of body fat or muscle, and therefore have a rather different physiology to other dogs of similar size (such as the [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]], or [[Alaskan Malamute]]). Laboratory-formulated diets designed for a generic \"large\" or \"giant\" breed are unlikely to take the needs of the big sighthounds into account.\n\nThe issues involved in [[raw feeding]] may be particularly relevant to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi.The [[Hortaya Borzaya]], a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. A lean body weight in itself is nothing to be concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is definitely not recommended.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:1879 Borzoi Flock.jpg|thumb|Borzoi Flock DHSB 325, owned by Max Hartenstein, Berlin Germany, 1879]]\n[[File:Tikhmenev (1904) Wolf hunt with borzois.jpg|thumb|''Wolf hunting with borzois'' (1904), Efim A. Tikhmenev.]]\n[[File:Sarah Bernhardt Clairin Henderson.jpg|thumb|The famous actress, [[Sarah Bernhardt]], depicted with borzoi, by Georges Clairin, French painter]]\n\nIt was long thought that Saluki type sighthounds were originally brought to [[Russia]] from Byzantium in the South about the 9th and 10th centuries and again later by the Mongol invaders from the East. However, now that the archeological archives and research results of the former USSR are open to scientists, it has become quite clear that the primal sighthound type evolved between the Kyrgyzstan, the lower Kazakhstan part of Altai and the Afghan plains, and that the earliest actual sighthound breeds were the plains Afghan hounds and the Kyrgyz Taigan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nThese ancient breeds then migrated South (founding the Tazi/Saluki branch) and West (founding the Stepnaya, Krimskaya and Hortaya branches) to develop into breeds adapted to those regions. This was a slow process which happened naturally through normal spreading of trade, with the silk and spice trade via the Silk Road being the prime vector.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nThe more modern Psovaya Borzaya was founded on Stepnaya, Hortaya and the Ukrainian-Polish version of the old Hort. There were also imports of Western sighthound breeds to add to the height and weight. It was crossed as well with the Russian Laika specifically and singularly to add resistance against Northern cold and a longer and thicker coat than the Southern sighthounds were equipped with.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dogs.animal-world.com/Hound-Dog-Breeds/Borzoi.php|title=Borzoi|last=Animal-World|website=Animal World|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180601083847/http://dogs.animal-world.com/Hound-Dog-Breeds/Borzoi.php|archive-date=June 1, 2018 |dead-url=no}}</ref>\n\nAll of these foundation types\u2014Tazi, Hortaya, Stepnaya, Krimskaya, and Hort\u2014already possessed the instincts and agility necessary for hunting and bringing down wolves.\n\nThe Psovoi was popular with the [[Tsar]]s before the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917 revolution]]. For centuries, Psovoi could not be purchased but only given as gifts from the Tsar. [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856-1929)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievich of Russia]] bred countless Psovoi at [[Perchino]], his private estate.<ref>Scott pp.10</ref>\n\nThe Russian concept of hunting trials was instituted during the era of the Tsars. As well as providing exciting sport, the tests were used for selecting borzoi breeding stock; only the quickest and most intelligent hunting dogs went on to produce progeny. For the aristocracy these trials were a well-organized ceremony, sometimes going on for days, with the borzois accompanied by mounted hunters and [[Foxhound]]s on the Russian [[steppe]]. Hares and other small game were by far the most numerous kills, but the hunters especially loved to test their dogs on wolf. If a wolf was sighted, the hunter would release a team of two or three borzois. The dogs would pursue the wolf, attack its neck from both sides, and hold it until the hunter arrived. The classic kill was by the human hunter with a knife. Wolf trials are still a regular part of the hunting diploma for all Russian sightdog breeds of the relevant type, either singly or in pairs or trios, in their native country.\n\nAfter the [[1917 Revolution]], wolf hunting with sighthounds has soon gone out of fashion as an \"aristocratic\" and a means- and -time-taking way of hunting.\nA necessity in a wolf-catching sighthound didn't exist, in addition to the old proved technique of batue with the use of baits, flags and other appeared new, way more effective\u2014from airplanes, from propeller sleighs, with electronic lure whistles. For decades the generations of few remaining sighthounds were regarded as hunting-suited, when showing enough attacking initiative for fox hunting. The rumours about persecution of sighthounds in post-revolutionary Russia is a legend of modern times, possibly based on similar incidents in [[Maoist China]].\n\nIn the late 1940s, a Soviet soldier named [[Constantin Esmont]] made detailed records of the various types of borzoi he found in Cossack villages. Esmont's illustrations were recently published and can be viewed by clicking on the link below.\n\nEsmont was concerned that the distinct types of borzaya were in danger of degenerating without a controlled system of breeding. He convinced the Soviet government that borzois were a valuable asset to the hunters who supported the fur industry and henceforth, their breeding was officially regulated. To this day short-haired [[Hortaya Borzaya]] are highly valued hunting dogs on the steppes, while the long-haired Psovaya Borzaya, is going through a hard period of restoration of its working qualities after decades of shadow, mainly show existence.\n\nExports of borzois to other countries were extremely rare during the Soviet era. However, enough had been taken to England, Scandinavia, Western Europe, and America in the late 19th century for the breed to establish itself outside its native country.\n\n== Notable borzois ==\n[[File:Borzaya.jpg|Borzoi portrait|thumb| 120px]]\n* The borzoi is the symbol of [[Alfred A.

It was bred from stock that originated in central [[Africa]]. Most of the major [[kennel club]]s in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world place the breed in the [[hound group]]\u2014more specifically, in the [[sighthound]] [[dog type|type]]. The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]] places the breed in its group five ([[spitz]] and primitive types), and the United Kennel Club (US) places the breed in its [[Sighthound and pariah group]].\n\nThe Basenji produces an unusual [[Yodelling|yodel]]-like sound (commonly called a \"baroo\"), due to its unusually shaped [[larynx]].<ref>Adapted from the book ''Why Pandas Do Handstands'', 2006, by Augustus Brown.</ref> This trait also gives the Basenji the nickname \"barkless dog\".<ref name=\"basenji1945\">{{cite web|url=http://www.basenji.org/african/tudor885.htm|title=BCOA African Stock Project - 1945 Letter from Africa|work=basenji.org}}</ref>\n\nBasenjis share many unique traits with [[pariah dog]] types. Basenjis, like [[dingoes]], [[New Guinea singing dog]]s and some other breeds of dog, come into [[estrus]] only once annually\u2014as compared to other dog breeds, which may have two or more breeding seasons every year. Both dingoes and Basenji lack a distinctive odor,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://akc.org/breeds/basenji/|title=Basenji Dog Breed Information|work=American Kennel Club|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rightpet.com/ratingofdog/dingo/300|title=Dingo - The Dingo as a pet - 300|work=RightPet}}</ref> and are prone to howls, yodels, and other vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds. One theory holds that the latter trait is the result of selecting against dogs that frequently bark\u2014in the traditional Central African context\u2014because barking could lead enemies to humans' forest encampments. While dogs that resemble the Basenji in some respects are commonplace over much of Africa, the breed's original foundation stock came from the old growth forest regions of the [[Congo Basin]], where its structure and type were fixed by adaptation to its habitat, as well as use (primarily net hunting in extremely dense [[old-growth forest]] vegetation).\n\nThe name comes from the [[Lingala]] language of the Congo, {{lang|ln|mbw\u00e1 na bas\u025b\u0301nzi}} which means 'villager dogs'.\n\n== Lineage ==\nThe Basenji has been identified as a [[Dog breed#Basal breeds|basal breed]] that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century.<ref name=larson2012>{{cite journal|author=Larson, G|year=2012|title=Rethinking dog domestication by integrating genetics, archeology, and biogeography|doi=10.1073/pnas.1203005109|volume=109|issue=23|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=8878\u20138883|pmid=22615366|pmc=3384140|bibcode=2012PNAS..109.8878L}}</ref> Recent DNA studies based on [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome sequences]] indicate that the domestic dog is a [[Genetic divergence|genetically divergent]] subspecies of the gray wolf and was derived from a now-extinct [[ghost population]] of Late Pleistocene wolves, and the basenji and the dingo are both considered to be [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] members of the domestic dog clade.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1101/gr.197517.115|pmid=26680994|title=Worldwide patterns of genomic variation and admixture in gray wolves|journal=Genome Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=163\u201373|year=2016|last1=Fan|first1=Zhenxin|last2=Silva|first2=Pedro|last3=Gronau|first3=Ilan|last4=Wang|first4=Shuoguo|last5=Armero|first5=Aitor Serres|last6=Schweizer|first6=Rena M.|last7=Ramirez|first7=Oscar|last8=Pollinger|first8=John|last9=Galaverni|first9=Marco|last10=Ortega Del-Vecchyo|first10=Diego|last11=Du|first11=Lianming|last12=Zhang|first12=Wenping|last13=Zhang|first13=Zhihe|last14=Xing|first14=Jinchuan|last15=Vil\u00e0|first15=Carles|last16=Marques-Bonet|first16=Tomas|last17=Godinho|first17=Raquel|last18=Yue|first18=Bisong|last19=Wayne|first19=Robert K.|url=http://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/10230/26027/1/Armero_gen_wor.pdf}}</ref><ref name=koepfli2015>{{cite journal|last1=Koepfli|first1=K.-P.|last2= Pollinger|first2=J.|last3= Godinho|first3=R.|last4= Robinson|first4=J.|last5= Lea|first5=A.|last6= Hendricks|first6=S.|last7= Schweizer|first7=R.

Dogs resembling modern Basenjis, the [[Tesem]], can be seen on [[stelae]] in the tombs of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[pharaoh]]s, sitting at the feet of their masters, looking just as they do today, with pricked ears and tightly curled tails.

These local dogs, which Europeans identified as a unique breed and called ''basenji,'' were prized by locals for their intelligence, courage, speed, and silence. An article published called The Intelligence of Dogs by Stanley Coren, Ph.D. questions this. It ranks the breed at #78 out of 79, which is the second to lowest rank in intelligence. Some consider this an unreliable list, as it focuses on only the ability to listen to a first command. Some consider independent dogs such as Basenjis and Afghan Hounds more intelligent than obedient breeds because of their ability to recognize which actions benefit them, and which simply please another.<ref>[https://www.basenji.org/BasenjiU/Owner/Handbook/HandPDF/UnderstandingOG.pdf Basenji Club Of America Understanding Basenjis]</ref>\n\nSeveral attempts were made to bring the breed to [[England]], but the earliest imports succumbed to disease. In 1923, for example, Lady Helen Nutting brought six Basenjis with her from [[Sudan]], but all six died from [[canine distemper|distemper]] shots they received in [[quarantine]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.basenji.org/african/nutting.htm |title=BCOA African Stock Project: Lady Helen Nutting |work=Basenji.org}}</ref> It was not until the 1930s that foundation stock was successfully established in England, and then to the [[United States]] by animal importer [[Henry Trefflich]].

A Basenji's forehead is wrinkled, even more so when they are young or extremely excited. A Basenji's eyes are typically almond-shaped. Basenjis typically weigh about {{convert|20\u201324|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Basenji/Appearance.aspx|title=Hiking with Your Dog {{!}} Things to Consider|access-date=2018-10-25}}</ref> and stand {{convert|16\u201318|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/basenji#/slide/1|title=Basenji Dog Breed Information, Pictures, Characteristics & Facts - Dogtime|work=Dogtime|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}</ref> at the shoulder. They are a square breed, which means they are as long as they are tall with males usually larger than females. Basenjis are athletic dogs, and deceptively powerful for their size. They have a graceful, confident gait like a trotting horse, and skim the ground in a double suspension gallop, with their characteristic curled tail straightened out for greater balance when running at their top speed. Basenjis come in a few different colorations: red, black, tricolor, and brindle, and they all have white feet, chests and tail tips. They can also come in ''trindle'', which is a tricolor with brindle points, a rare combination.\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Basenji is alert, energetic, curious and reserved with strangers. The Basenji tends to become emotionally attached to a single human. Basenjis may not get along with non-canine pets. Basenjis dislike wet weather, like to climb, and can easily get over chain wire fences.\n\nBasenjis often stand on their hind legs, somewhat like a [[meerkat]], by themselves or leaning on something; this behavior is often observed when the dog is curious about something. Basenjis have a strong prey drive.

Fanconi syndrome usually presents between 4 and 8 years of age, but sometimes as early as 3 years or as late as 10 years. Fanconi syndrome is treatable and organ damage is reduced if treatment begins early. Basenji owners are advised to test their dog's urine for glucose once a month beginning at the age of 3 years. Glucose testing strips designed for human diabetics are inexpensive and available at most pharmacies. A Fanconi disease management protocol has been developed that can be used by veterinarians to treat Fanconi-afflicted dogs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gonto |first1=Steve |title=Fanconi Renal Disease Management Protocol for Veterinarians |url= https://basenjicompanions.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/aaa_fanconi-protocol-feb-2016.pdf |format=PDF |date=12 February 2016 |publisher=Basenji Club of America |via=Basenji Companions website |access-date=22 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Fanconi DNA linkage test ====\n{{Off-topic|date=February 2018|reason=Move to article about the disease; this has nothign to do with Basenjis in particular.}}\nIn 2007, the first [[genetic linkage|linked marker]] DNA test was released for predicting Fanconi syndrome in Basenjis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basenji Health Endowment: Fanconi Linkage Test FAQ |url= http://www.basenjihealth.org/linkage-faq.html |access-date=1 December 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071201144657/http://basenjihealth.org/linkage-faq.html#suspension |archive-date=1 December 2007 |dead-url=yes}}</ref> With this test, it is possible to more accurately determine the probability of a dog's carrying the gene for Fanconi syndrome.\n\nDogs tested using this \"linkage test\" return one of the following statuses:\n:*'''Probably clear/normal'''\n::Indicates the individual has most likely inherited normal DNA from both parents. It is unlikely that Basenjis that test this way will produce affected puppies, no matter which dog they breed with.\n:*'''Probably carrier'''\n::Indicates the individual has most likely inherited normal DNA from one parent and DNA with the Fanconi syndrome mutation from the other parent.This basenji is unlikely to develop Fanconi syndrome, but could produce puppies that do. To minimize the chances of this happening, it is recommended carriers be bred only to those that test as Probably clear/Normal for Fanconi syndrome.\n:*'''Probably equivocal/indeterminate'''\n::Indicates the individual's DNA contained features found in both \"normal\" and \"carrier\" Basenjis. At present it cannot be predicted whether these Basenjis are carriers or normal; however, it is unlikely that they will develop Fanconi syndrome. The safest strategy would be to treat them as \u201ccarriers\u201d and bred to  only those Basenjis that test as Probably Clear/Normal for Fanconi syndrome.\n:*'''Probably affected'''\n::Indicates the individual is likely to develop clinical Fanconi syndrome and is likely to produce puppies with Fanconi syndrome if bred to Basenjis other than those that test as Probably Clear/Normal for Fanconi syndrome.\n\nThis linkage test is being provided as a tool to assist breeders whilst research continues towards the development of the direct Fanconi test.\n\n=== Other Basenji health issues ===\n\nBasenjis sometimes carry a simple recessive gene that, when [[homozygous]] for the defect, causes [[hemolysis|genetic hemolytic anemia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basenjiweb.com/basenji-health-issues.html|title=Basenji Health Issues|work=basenjiweb.com}}</ref> Most 21st-century Basenjis are descended from ancestors that have tested clean. When lineage from a fully tested line (set of ancestors) cannot be completely verified, the dog should be tested before breeding. As this is a non-invasive DNA test, a Basenji can be tested for HA at any time.\n\nBasenjis sometimes suffer from [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], resulting in loss of mobility and arthritis-like symptoms. All dogs should be tested by either [[Orthopedic Foundation for Animals|OFA]] or [[PennHIP]] prior to breeding.\n\n[[Malabsorption]], or immunoproliferative enteropathy, is an autoimmune intestinal disease that leads to [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], chronic [[diarrhea]], and even death. A special diet can improve the quality of life for afflicted dogs.\n\nThe breed can also fall victim to [[progressive retinal atrophy]] (a degeneration of the retina causing blindness) and several less serious hereditary eye problems such as [[coloboma]] (a hole in the eye structure), and [[persistent pupillary membrane]] (tiny threads across the pupil).\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Basenji\">\nFile:Dog - \u0d28\u0d3e\u0d2f-6.JPG| Tri-Colored Basenji\n\nFile:Trindle_basenji.jpg|Trindle Basenji\nBenny-Basenji.jpg|Basenji showing characteristic, forward-pointing ears.\n\nFile:Basenjis Charly e Bravo a sette mesi.jpg|A pair of red Basenjis\n</gallery>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n* The title character of the 1954 novel ''[[Good-bye, My Lady]]'', by [[James H.

[[List of The Wild Thornberrys characters|Nigel Thornberry]] encounters a group of tribesmen along with their [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] hunting dogs. The series's director, [[Mark Risley]], owns several Basenjis, and his dogs provided the recorded voices for their animated counterparts.\n* An episode of ''[[Pound Puppies (2010 TV series)|Pound Puppies]]'', \"The Pups Who Loved Me\", revolves around a Basenji secret agent character by the name of Bondo. The dog is drawn with an appropriate likeness, but appears to bark, which is uncharacteristic of the breed.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[African village dog]]\n* [[Indian pariah dog]]\n* [[Pariah dog]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons}}\n* {{dmoz|Recreation/Pets/Dogs/Breeds/Hound_Group/Basenji/}}\n\n<!-- DO NOT ADD PRIVATE BREEDERS OR ADVERTISING; IT WILL BE REMOVED -->\n\n<!--Editors: breed registry, club, rescue, and kennel information links are placed on DMOZ, not here-->\n\n{{Primitive dogs}}\n{{Hounds}}\n{{FCI 5}}\n[[Category:Dog breeds]]\n[[Category:FCI breeds]]\n[[Category:Dog breeds originating in Africa]]\n[[Category:Rare dog breeds]]", "sha1": "nzuca8kycpc2nbs67hscn7u9ardcf4n"}}, {"title": "Brit milah", "ns": "0", "id": "4768", "revision": {"id": "866402458", "parentid": "866398595", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T03:02:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "Srich32977", "id": "8372814"}, "comment": "[[WP:UCB|Assisted by Citation bot]] | Cleaned up using [[WP:AutoEd|AutoEd]] Copyedit (major)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Bris|the Seinfeld episode|The Bris}}\n{{Religious text primary|date=June 2018}}\n{{Infobox Halacha\n| image = [[File:GerrerRebbe.JPG|230px]]\n| caption =\n| verse = {{bibleverse||Genesis|17:1-14|HE}}<br />{{bibleverse||Leviticus|12:3|HE}}\n| talmud = | mishnah = | rambam = | sa = | codes = }}\n{{Judaism|culture}}\nThe '''''brit milah''''' ({{lang-he-n|\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4}}, {{IPA-he|b\u0281it mi\u02c8la|pron}}; [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] pronunciation: {{IPA-he|b\u0281is \u02c8mil\u0259|}}, \"covenant of [[circumcision]]\"; [[Yiddish]] pronunciation: ''bris'' {{IPA-yi|b\u0280\u026as|}}) is a Jewish religious male [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision ceremony]] performed by a [[mohel]] (\"circumciser\") on the eighth day of the infant's life. The ''brit milah'' is followed by a celebratory meal (''[[seudat mitzvah]]'').\n\n==Biblical references==\n{{main|Religious male circumcision}}\n{{see also|Covenant (biblical)#Abrahamic covenant}}\n[[File:Isaac's circumcision, Regensburg c1300.jpg|thumb|left|\"Isaac's Circumcision\", Regensburg Pentateuch, c1300]]\nAccording to the [[Hebrew Bible]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:10\u201314|HE}}) [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] commanded the Biblical patriarch [[Abraham]] to be circumcised, an act to be followed by his descendants:\n{{quote|10 This is My covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised. 11 And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt Me and you. 12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner, that is not of thy seed. 13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 14 And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken My covenant.}}\n\nAlso, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|12:3|HE}} provides: \"And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.\"\n\nAccording to the [[Hebrew Bible]], it was \"a reproach\" for an [[Israelite]] to be uncircumcised ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 5:9.)  The term ''arelim'' (\"uncircumcised\" [plural]) is used opprobriously, denoting the [[Philistines]] and other non-Israelites ([[Books of Samuel|I Samuel]] 14:6, 31:4; II Samuel 1:20) and used in conjunction with ''tameh'' (unpure) for heathen ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 52:1). The word ''arel'' (\"uncircumcised\" [singular]) is also employed for \"impermeable\" ([[Leviticus]] 26:41, \"their uncircumcised hearts\"; compare [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 9:25; [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 44:7, 9); it is also applied to the first three years' fruit of a tree, which is forbidden ([[Leviticus]] 19:23).\n\nHowever, the Israelites born in the wilderness after the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt were not circumcised. [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 5:2\u20139, explains, \"all the people that came out\" of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] were circumcised, but those \"born in the wilderness\" were not. Therefore, Joshua, before the celebration of the [[Passover]], had them circumcised at [[Gilgal]] specifically before they entered Canaan. Abraham, too, was circumcised when he moved into Canaan.\n\nThe prophetic tradition emphasizes that God expects people to be good as well as pious, and that non-Jews will be judged based on their ethical behavior, see [[Noahide Law]]. Thus, Jeremiah 9:25\u201326 says that circumcised and uncircumcised will be punished alike by the Lord; for \"all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.\"\n\nThe penalty of non-observance is ''[[kareth]]'' (spiritual excision from the Jewish nation), as noted in {{bibleverse||Genesis|17:1\u201314|HE}}. [[Conversion to Judaism]] for non-Israelites in Biblical times necessitated circumcision, otherwise one could not partake in the [[Passover]] offering ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}). Today, as in the time of Abraham, it is required of converts in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]]. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|34:14\u201316|HE}}).\n\nAs found in Genesis 17:1\u201314, ''brit milah'' is considered to be so important that should the eighth day fall on [[Shabbat|the Sabbath]], actions that would normally be forbidden because of the sanctity of the day are permitted in order to fulfill the requirement to circumcise.<ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/shabbat19.html Tractate Shabbat: Chapter 19, Regulations ordained by R. Eliezer concerning circumcision on the Sabbath] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425221632/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/shabbat19.html |date=2016-04-25 }}, accessed on 23 April 2016</ref> The [[Talmud]], when discussing the importance of Milah, compares it to being equal to all other mitzvot (commandments) based on the [[gematria]] for ''brit'' of 612 (Tractate [[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]] 32a).\n\nCovenants in ancient times were sometimes sealed by severing an animal, with the implication that the party who breaks the covenant will suffer a similar fate. In Hebrew, the verb meaning \"to seal a covenant\" translates literally as \"to cut\". It is presumed by Jewish scholars that the removal of the foreskin symbolically represents such a sealing of the covenant.<ref>\"Circumcision.\" Mark Popovsky.

The ritual of ''metzitzah'' is found in [[Mishnah]] Shabbat 19:2, which lists it as one of the four steps involved in the circumcision rite. Rabbi [[Moses Sofer]] (1762\u20131839) observed that the Talmud states that the rationale for this part of the ritual was hygienic \u2014 i.e., to protect the health of the child.  The Chasam Sofer issued a leniency (Heter) that some consider to have been conditional to perform ''metzitzah'' with a sponge to be used instead of oral suction in a letter to his student, Rabbi [[Lazar Horowitz]] of Vienna. This letter was never published among Rabbi Sofer's responsa but rather in the secular journal ''Kochvei Yitzchok.''<ref>{{cite web\n  | url         = http://www.thejewishweek.com/top/editletcontent.php3?artid=4591\n  | title       = Editorial & Opinion\n  | publisher   = The Jewish Week\n  | accessdate  = 2012-04-25\n  | deadurl     = yes\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20061120073118/http://www.thejewishweek.com/top/editletcontent.php3?artid=4591| archivedate=November 20, 2006}}</ref> along with letters from Dr. Wertheimer, the chief doctor of the Viennese General Hospital.

He also states (''Yoreh Deah'' 244) that the practice is possibly a Sinaitic tradition, i.e., [[Halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai]]. Other sources contradict this claim, with copies of Moses Sofer's responsa making no mention of the legal case or of his ruling applying in only one situation. Rather, that responsa makes quite clear that \"metzizah\" was a health measure and should never be employed where there is a health risk to the infant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2012/04/chasam-sofers-ruling-on-metzitzah-be.html |website=onthemainline.blogspot.com |title=The Chasam Sofer's ruling on Metzitzah Be-peh |date=April 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402175402/http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2012/04/chasam-sofers-ruling-on-metzitzah-be.html |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Chaim Hezekiah Medini]], after corresponding with the greatest Jewish sages of the generation, concluded the practice to be [[Halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai]] and elaborates on what prompted Moses Sofer to give the above ruling.<ref>Sdei Chemed vol. 8 p. 238</ref> He tells the story that a student of Moses Sofer, [[Lazar Horowitz]], [[Chief Rabbi of Vienna]] at the time and author of the responsa ''Yad Elazer'', needed the ruling because of a governmental attempt to ban circumcision completely if it included ''metztitzah b'peh.'' He therefore asked Sofer to give him permission to do ''brit milah'' without ''metzitzah b\u2019peh.''

This action lowers the internal pressure in the tissues of the organ, in the blood vessels of the head of the organ and in the exposed ends of the arterioles that have just been cut. Thus, the difference between the pressure in the blood vessels in the base of the organ and the pressure in the blood vessels at its tip is increased. This requirement has deep religious significance as well as medical benefits....Immediately after incising or injuring an artery, the arterial walls contract and obstruct, or at least reduce, the flow of blood. Since the arterioles of the orlah, or the foreskin, branch off from the dorsal arteries (the arteries of the upper side of the organ), cutting away the foreskin can result in a temporary obstruction in these dorsal arteries. This temporary obstruction, caused by arterial muscle contraction, continues to develop into a more enduring blockage as the stationary blood begins to clot. The tragic result can be severe hypoxia (deprivation of the supply of blood and oxygen) of the glans penis.28 If the arterial obstruction becomes more permanent, gangrene follows; the baby may lose his glans, and it may even become a life-threatening situation. Such cases have been known to occur. Only by immediately clearing the blockage can one prevent such clotting from happening. Performing metzitzah immediately after circumcision lowers the internal pressure within the tissues and blood vessels of the glans, thus raising the pressure gradient between the blood vessels at the base of the organ and the blood vessels at its distal end\u2014the glans as well as the excised arterioles of the foreskin, which branch off of the dorsal arteries. This increase in pressure gradient (by a factor of four to six!) can resolve an acute temporary blockage and restore blood flow to the glans, thus significantly reducing both the danger of immediate, acute hypoxia and the danger of developing a permanent obstruction by means of coagulation. How do we know when a temporary blockage has successfully been averted? When the \u201cblood in the further reaches [i.e., the proximal dorsal artery] is extracted,\u201d as Rambam has stated.}}\n</ref>\n\n====Barriers====\nBecause of the risk of infection, some rabbinical authorities have ruled that the traditional practice of direct contact should be replaced by using a sterile tube between the wound and the [[mohel]]'s mouth, so there is no direct oral contact.

One ramification is that the brit is not considered complete unless a drop of blood is actually drawn. The standard medical methods of [[circumcision]] through constriction do not meet the requirements of the [[halakhah]] for brit milah, because they cause [[hemostasis]], ''i.e.'', they stop the flow of blood. Moreover, circumcision alone, in the absence of the brit milah ceremony, does not fulfill the requirements of the mitzvah. Therefore, in cases where a Jew who was circumcised outside of a brit milah, an already-circumcised convert, or an [[Aposthia|aposthetic]] (born without a foreskin) individual, the mohel draws a symbolic drop of blood ({{lang-he|\u05d4\u05d8\u05e4\u05ea \u05d3\u05dd}}, {{transl|he|''hatafat-dam''}}) from the penis at the point where the foreskin would have been or was attached.<ref>[[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Yoreh De'ah]], 263:4</ref>\n\n==''Milah l'shem giur''==\n[[File:G\u00f6ttingen-Beschneidungswerkzeuge.02.JPG|thumb|right|Set of brit milah implements, [[G\u00f6ttingen]] city museum]]\nA ''Milah L'shem giur'' is a \"Circumcision for the purpose of conversion\". In [[Orthodox Judaism]], this procedure is usually done by adoptive parents for adopted boys who are being converted as part of the adoption or by families with young children converting together. It is also required for adult converts who were not previously circumcised, e.g. those born in countries where circumcision at birth is not common. The conversion of a minor is valid in both [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] until a child reaches the age of majority (13 for a boy, 12 for a girl); at that time the child has the option of renouncing his conversion and Judaism, and the conversion will then be considered retroactively invalid. He must be informed of his right to renounce his conversion if he wishes. If he does not make such a statement, it is accepted that the boy is halakhically Jewish. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis will generally not convert a non-Jewish child raised by a mother who has not converted to Judaism.<ref>Rabbi Paysach J. Krohn, ''Bris Milah'' [[Artscroll|Mesorah Publications Ltd]], 1985, pp.103-105</ref>\n\nThe laws of conversion and conversion-related circumcision in [[Orthodox Judaism]] have numerous complications, and authorities recommend that a rabbi be consulted well in advance.\n\nIn [[Conservative Judaism]], the Milah l'Shem giur procedure is also performed for a boy whose mother has not converted, but with the intention that the child be raised Jewish.  This conversion of a child to Judaism without the conversion of the mother is allowed by [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] interpretations of [[halakha]]. Conservative Rabbis will authorize it only under the condition that the child be raised as a Jew in a single-faith household. Should the mother convert, and if the boy has not yet reached his third birthday, the child may be immersed in the [[mikveh]] with the mother, after the mother has already immersed, to become Jewish.  If the mother does not convert, the child may be immersed in a mikveh, or body of natural waters, to complete the child's conversion to Judaism. This can be done before the child is even one year old. If the child did not immerse in the [[mikveh]], or the boy was too old, then the child may choose of their own accord to become Jewish at age 13 as a [[Bar Mitzvah]], and complete the conversion then.<ref>[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19861990/reisner_conversion.pdf Rabbi Avram Israel Reisner, On the conversion of adoptive and patrilineal children] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127135422/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19861990/reisner_conversion.pdf |date=2010-11-27 }}, Rabbinical Assembly [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], 1988</ref>\n* The ceremony, when performed l'Shem giur, does not have to be performed on a particular day, and does not override [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish Holidays]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/212,657813/Can-a-brit-take-place-on-Yom-Kippur.html\n |title       = Can a brit take place on Yom Kippur? \u2013 holidays general information holiday information life cycle circumcision the brit\n |publisher   = Askmoses.com\n |accessdate  = 2012-04-25\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120221222357/http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/212,657813/Can-a-brit-take-place-on-Yom-Kippur.html\n |archivedate = 2012-02-21\n |df          =\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.ahavat-israel.com/torat/britmila.php\n |title       = The Mitzvah of Brit Milah (Bris)\n |publisher   = Ahavat Israel\n |accessdate  = 2012-04-25\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204162505/http://www.ahavat-israel.com/torat/britmila.php\n |archivedate = 2012-02-04\n |df          =\n}}</ref>\n* In Orthodox Judaism, there is a split of authorities on whether the child receives a [[Hebrew name]] at the Brit ceremony or upon immersion in the [[Mikvah]].

The organ chosen for the mark is the one responsible for the sustenance of the species.\n# The completion effected by circumcision is not congenital, but left to the man. This implies that as he completes the form of his body, so can he complete the form of his soul.\n\nTalmud professor [[Daniel Boyarin]] offered two explanations for circumcision. One is that it is a literal inscription on the Jewish body of the name of God in the form of the letter \"[[yodh|yud]]\" (from \"yesod\"). The second is that the act of bleeding represents a feminization of Jewish men, significant in the sense that the covenant represents a marriage between Jews and (a symbolically male) God.<ref>Boyarin, Daniel. {{\"'}}This We Know to Be the Carnal Israel': Circumcision and the Erotic Life of God and Israel\", Critical Inquiry. (Spring, 1992), 474-506.</ref>\n\n==Reform Judaism==\nThe Reform societies established in Frankfurt and Berlin regarded circumcision as barbaric and wished to abolish it. However, while prominent rabbis such as [[Abraham Geiger]] believed the ritual to be barbaric and outdated, they refrained from instituting any change in this matter. In 1843, when a father in Frankfurt refused to circumcise his son, rabbis of all shades in Germany stated it was mandated by Jewish law; even [[Samuel Holdheim]] affirmed this.<ref name=\"A\">Judith Bleich, \"The Circumcision Controversy in Classical Reform in Historical Context\", KTAV Publishing House, 2007. pp. 1\u201328.</ref> By 1871, Reform rabbinic leadership in Germany reasserted \"the supreme importance of circumcision in Judaism\", while affirming the traditional viewpoint that non-circumcised are Jews nonetheless.

European governments considered regulating, if not banning, ''berit milah'' on the grounds that it posed potential medical dangers. In the 1840s, radical Jewish reformers in [[Frankfurt]] asserted that circumcision should no longer be compulsory. This controversy reached [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the 1880s. Russian Jewish physicians expressed concern over two central issues: the competence of those carrying out the procedure and the method used for ''metsitsah''. Many Jewish physicians supported the idea of procedural and hygienic reforms in the practice, and they debated the question of physician supervision during the ceremony. Most significantly, many advocated carrying out ''metsitsah'' by pipette, not by mouth. In 1889, a committee on circumcision convened by the Russian Society for the Protection of Health, which included leading Jewish figures, recommended educating the Jewish public about the concerns connected with circumcision, in particular, the possible transmission of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[syphilis]] through the custom of ''metsitsah'' by mouth.\n\nVeniamin Portugalov, who\u2014alone among Russian Jewish physicians\u2014called for the abolition of circumcision, set off these discussions. Portugalov not only denied all medical claims regarding the sanitary advantages of circumcision but disparaged the practice as barbaric, likening it to pagan ritual mutilation. Ritual circumcision, he claimed, stood as a self-imposed obstacle to the Jews\u2019 [[Jewish emancipation|attainment of true equality with the other peoples of Europe]].|author=Epstein, Lisa|source=[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Circumcision \"Circumcision\"], ''[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]'', [[Yale University Press]].}}</ref> From the early days of the movement in [[Germany]] and [[Eastern Europe]],<ref name=\"Yivo\" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Gollaher|first=David|author-link=David Gollaher|title=Circumcision: A History Of The World's Most Controversial Surgery |chapter=1, ''The Jewish Tradition'' |pages=1\u201330 |date=February 2001 |publisher=Basic Books|location=New York City|isbn=978-0465026531 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usEzSffvPBMC}}</ref> some classical Reformers hoped to replace ritual circumcision \"with a symbolic act, as has been done for other bloody practices, such as the sacrifices\".<ref>Katz, Jacob (1998), ''Divine Law in Human Hands: Case Studies in Halakhic Flexibility''.

In Elyse Wechterman's essay ''A Plea for Inclusion'', she argues that, even in the absence of circumcision, committed Jews should never be turned away, especially by a movement \"where no other ritual observance is mandated\".

In most of Europe, both the government and the unlearned Jewish masses believed circumcision to be a rite akin to baptism, and the law allowed communities not to register uncircumcised children as Jewish. This legal maneuver spurred several debates addressing the advisibility of its use, since many parents later chose to convert to Christianity. In early 20th-century Russia, [[Chaim Soloveitchik]] advised his colleagues to reject this measure, stating that uncircumcised Jewish males are no less Jewish than Jews who violate other commandments.<ref name=\"A\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Brit rechitzah]]\n* [[Circumcision of Jesus]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144122/jewish/brit-milah-circumcision.htm/ Chabad.org's Brit Milah: The Covenant of Circumcision]\n* [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4391-circumcision/ Jewish Encyclopedia's entry for Circumcision]\n* [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/circumcision-brit-milah/ Jewish Virtual Library's Circumcision \u2013 Brit Milah]\n* [http://circcentral.bobmeyer99.com/ CircCentral, an online museum of Brit Milah instruments]\n* [http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=26787/ The Laws of Brit Milah by Rabbi Eliezer Melamed]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n{{Circumcision series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brit Milah}}\n[[Category:Birth in Judaism]]\n[[Category:Circumcision]]\n[[Category:Hebrew words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Positive Mitzvoth]]\n[[Category:Jewish medical ethics]]\n[[Category:Religion and children]]\n[[Category:Religious controversies]]\n[[Category:Rites of passage]]\n[[Category:Jewish life cycle]]\n[[Category:Lech-Lecha]]", "sha1": "s0bahqr9cckeyhtt4fzuuow3czpidow"}}, {"title": "Business ethics", "ns": "0", "id": "4770", "revision": {"id": "865663018", "parentid": "865662991", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T11:07:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "Shellwood", "id": "2366721"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/212.219.255.72|212.219.255.72]] ([[User talk:212.219.255.72|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Business administration}}\n\n'''Business ethics'''  (also known as '''corporate ethics''') is a form of [[applied ethics]] or [[professional ethics]], that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that can arise in a business environment.

Business ethics have two dimensions, [[normative business ethics]] or [[descriptive business ethics]]. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns.\n\nInterest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, most major corporations today promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters.\n\nAdam Smith said, \"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\"<ref>Smith, A (1776/ 1952) An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, p. 55</ref> Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.

Many verses discuss business ethics, in particular verse 113, adapting to a changing environment in verses 474, 426, and 140, learning the intricacies of different tasks in verses 462 and 677.<ref>Management Thoughts in Thirukkural by K.

If a company's purpose is to maximize shareholder returns, then sacrificing profits for other concerns is a violation of its [[fiduciary responsibility]]. Corporate entities are legally considered as persons in the United States and in most nations. The 'corporate persons' are legally entitled to the rights and liabilities due to citizens as persons.\n\nEthics are the rules or standards that govern our decisions on a daily basis. Many consider \u201cethics\u201d with conscience or a simplistic sense of \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong.\u201d Others would say that ethics is an internal code that governs an individual\u2019s conduct, ingrained into each person by family, faith, tradition, community, laws, and personal mores.

Boston, Springer pp. 87\u2013108 {{ISBN|1-4020-8400-5}}</ref>\n\nMarketing ethics involves pricing practices, including illegal actions such as [[price fixing]] and legal actions including [[price discrimination]] and [[price skimming]]. Certain promotional activities have drawn fire, including  [[greenwash]]ing, [[bait and switch]], [[shill]]ing, [[viral marketing]], [[spam (electronic)]], [[pyramid scheme]]s and [[multi-level marketing]]. Advertising has raised objections about [[attack ad]]s, [[subliminal message]]s, [[sex in advertising]] and [[marketing in schools]].\n\n===Emerging issues===\nBeing the most important element of a business, stakeholders' main concern is to determine whether or not the business is behaving ethically or unethically. The business' actions and decisions should be primarily ethical before it happens to become an ethical or even legal issue. \"In the case of the government, community, and society what was merely an ethical issue can become a legal debate and eventually law.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making & Cases, 11e. O.C Ferrell, John Fraedrich and Linda Ferrell</ref>\nSome unethical issues are:\n\n1. '''Fairness'''\nThe three aspects that motivate people to be fair is; equality, optimization, and reciprocity. Fairness is the quality of being just, equitable, and impartial.\n\n2. '''Misuse of company's times & Resources'''\nThis particular topic may not seems to be a very common one, but it is very important, as it costs a company billions of dollars on a yearly basis. This misuse is from late arrivals, leaving early, long lunch breaks, inappropriate sick days etc. This has been observed as a major form of misconduct in businesses today. One of the greatest ways employees participate in misuse of company's time and resources is by using the company computer for personal use.\n\n3. '''Consumer Fraud'''\nThere are many different types of fraud, namely; friendly fraud, return fraud, wardrobing, price arbitrage, returning stolen goods.\nFraud is a major unethical practice within businesses which should be paid special attention. Consumer fraud is when consumers attempt to deceive businesses for their very own benefit.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n4. '''Abusive Behavior'''\nA common ethical issue among employees. Abusive behavior consists of inflicting intimidating acts on other employees. Such acts include harassing, using profanity, threatening someone physically and insulting them, and being annoying.<ref>Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making & Cases, 9e. O.C Ferrell, John Fraedrich and Linda Ferrell</ref>\n\n===Production===\nThis area of business ethics usually deals with the duties of a company to ensure that products and production processes do not needlessly cause harm. Since few goods and services can be produced and consumed with zero risk, determining the ethical course can be problematic. In some case consumers demand products that harm them, such as [[tobacco]] products. Production may have environmental impacts, including [[pollution]], [[habitat destruction]] and [[urban sprawl]]. The downstream effects of technologies [[nuclear power]], [[genetically modified food]] and [[mobile phone]]s may not be well understood. While the [[precautionary principle]] may prohibit introducing new technology whose consequences are not fully understood, that principle would have prohibited most new technology introduced since the [[industrial revolution]]. Product testing protocols have been attacked for violating the rights of both [[clinical trials|humans]] and [[animal testing|animals]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}With technology growing there are sources and websites that provide list and information on companies and business and that are \"green\" or do not test on animals. These companies often advertise this and are growing in popularity among the younger generations.\n\n===Property===\n{{Main|Private property||Property rights}}\n\nThe etymological root of property is the [[Latin]] 'proprius'<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=property Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-02.</ref> which refers to 'nature', 'quality', 'one's own', 'special characteristic', 'proper', 'intrinsic', 'inherent', 'regular', 'normal', 'genuine', 'thorough, complete, perfect' etc. The word property is value loaded and associated with the personal qualities of propriety and respectability, also implies questions relating to ownership. A 'proper' person owns and is true to herself or himself, and is thus genuine, perfect and pure.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2007 |p=25}}</ref>\n\n====Modern history of property rights====\nModern discourse on property emerged by the turn of the 17th century within theological discussions of that time. For instance, [[John Locke]] justified [[property rights]] saying that God had made \"the earth, and all inferior creatures, [in] common to all men\".<ref>Harris, J.W. (1996), \"Who owns My Body\", Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, 16: 55\u201384.

Theoretical issues such as cultural relativity of ethical values receive more emphasis in this field. Other, older issues can be grouped here as well. Issues and subfields include:\n*The search for universal values as a basis for international commercial behaviour.\n*Comparison of business ethical traditions in different countries. Also, on the basis of their respective GDP and [Corruption rankings].\n*Comparison of business ethical traditions from various religious perspectives.\n*Ethical issues arising out of international business transactions; e.g., [[bioprospecting]] and biopiracy in the pharmaceutical industry; the [[fair trade]] movement; [[transfer pricing]].\n*Issues such as [[globalization]] and [[cultural imperialism]].\n*Varying global standards\u2014e.g., the use of [[child labor]].\n*The way in which multinationals take advantage of international differences, such as outsourcing production (e.g. clothes) and services (e.g. call centres) to low-wage countries.\n*The permissibility of international commerce with pariah states.\n\nThe success of any business depends on its financial performance. Financial accounting helps the management to report and also, control the business performance.\n\nThe information regarding the financial performance of the company plays an important role in enabling people to take right decision about the company. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand how to record based on accounting conventions and concepts ensure unambling and accurate records.\n\nForeign countries often use dumping as a competitive threat, selling products at prices lower than their normal value. This can lead to problems in domestic markets. It becomes difficult for these markets to compete with the pricing set by foreign markets. In 2009, the International Trade Commission has been researching anti-dumping laws. Dumping is often seen as an ethical issue, as larger companies are taking advantage of other less economically advanced companies.\n\n==Issues==\nEthical issues often arise in business settings, whether through business transactions or forming new business relationships. An [[Ethics|ethical issue]] in a business atmosphere may refer to any situation that requires business associates as individuals, or as a group (for example, a department or firm) to evaluate the [[morality]] of specific actions, and subsequently make a decision amongst the choices. Some ethical issues of particular concern in today's evolving business market include such topics as: [[honesty]], [[integrity]], professional behaviors, [[environmental issue]]s, [[harassment]], and [[fraud]] to name a few. It is integral to the success of an organization that ethics issues such as these be properly addressed and resolved. Businesses should strive to educate themselves on these issues, and ethical practices in general. From a 2009 National Business Ethics survey, it was found that types of employee-observed ethical misconduct included abusive behavior (at a rate of 22 percent), [[discrimination]] (at a rate of 14 percent), improper hiring practices (at a rate of 10 percent), and company resource abuse (at a rate of percent).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=Ferrell|first=Linda|publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning|year=2013|isbn=978-1-111-82516-4|location=Mason, OH|pages=61\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe ethical issues associated with honesty are widespread and vary greatly in business, from the misuse of company time or resources to lying with malicious intent, engaging in [[bribery]], or creating conflicts of interest within an organization. Honesty encompasses wholly the truthful speech and actions of an individual. Some cultures and belief systems even consider honesty to be an essential pillar of life, such as Confucianism and Buddhism (referred to as [[sacca]], part of the [[Four Noble Truths]]). Many employees lie in order to reach goals, avoid assignments or negative issues; however, sacrificing honesty in order to gain status or reap rewards poses potential problems for the overall ethical culture organization, and jeopardizes organizational goals in the long run. Using company time or resources for personal use is also, commonly viewed as unethical because it boils down to stealing from the company. The misuse of resources costs companies billions of dollars each year, averaging about 4.25 hours per week of stolen time alone, and employees' abuse of Internet services is another main concern.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=Ferrell|first=O.C.|last2=Fraedrich|first2=John|last3=Ferrell|first3=Linda|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=66, 70}}</ref> Bribery, on the other hand, is not only considered unethical is business practices, but it is also illegal. In accordance with this, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was established in 1977 to deter international businesses from giving or receiving unwarranted payments and gifts that were intended to influence the decisions of executives and political officials.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Marketing: Managing Across Borders and Cultures|last=Deresky|first=Helen|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2017|isbn=9780134376042|location=Hoboken|pages=58}}</ref> Although, small payments known as [[Facilitating payment|facilitation payments]] will not be considered unlawful under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act if they are used towards regular public governance activities, such as permits or licenses.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n== Influential factors on business ethics ==\nMany aspects in the work environment influence an individual's decision-making regarding ethics in the business world. When an individual is on the path of growing a company, many outside influences can pressure them to perform a certain way. The core of the person's performance in the workplace is rooted by their personal code of behavior. A person's personal code of ethics encompasses many different qualities such as integrity, honesty, communication, respect, compassion, and common goals. In addition, the ethical standards set forth by a person's superior(s) often translate into their own code of ethics. The company's policy is the 'umbrella' of ethics that play a major role in the personal development and decision-making processes that people make in respects to ethical behavior.\n\nThe ethics of a company and its' individuals are heavily influenced by the state of their country. If a country is heavily plagued with poverty, large corporations continuously grow, but smaller companies begin to wither, and are then forced to adapt and scavenge for any method of survival. As a result, the leadership of the company is often tempted to participate in unethical methods to obtain new business opportunities. Additionally, Social Media is arguably the most influential factor in ethics. The immediate access to so much information and the opinions of millions highly influence people's behaviors. The desire to confirm with what is portrayed as the norm often manipulates our idea of what is morally and ethically sound. Popular trends on social media and the instant gratification that is received from participating in such quickly distort people's ideas and decisions.\n\n==Economic systems==\n[[Political economy]] and [[political philosophy]] have ethical implications, particularly regarding the distribution of economic benefits.<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard de|last=George|year=1999|title=Business Ethics|isbn=0-412-46080-7}}</ref> [[John Rawls]] and [[Robert Nozick]] are both notable contributors. For example, Rawls has been interpreted as [https://web.archive.org/web/20121124045211/http://works.bepress.com/julian_friedland/3/ offering a critique of offshore outsourcing] on social contract grounds, whereas Nozick's libertarian philosophy rejects the notion of any positive corporate social obligation.\n\n==Law and regulation==\n\u201c[[Law]]s\u201d are the written statutes, codes, and opinions of government organizations by which citizens, businesses, and persons present within a jurisdiction are expected to govern themselves or face legal sanction. Sanctions for [[law violation|violating]] the law can include (a) [[civil penalties]], such as fines, pecuniary damages, and loss of licenses, property, rights, or privileges; (b) criminal penalties, such as fines, probation, imprisonment, or a combination thereof; or (c) both civil and criminal penalties.\n\nVery often it is held that business is not bound by any ethics other than abiding by the law. [[Milton Friedman]] is the pioneer of the view. He held that corporations have the obligation to make a profit within the framework of the legal system, nothing more.<ref>{{harvnb|Machan|2007}}; {{harvnb|Frederic|2002|pp=88}}</ref> Friedman made it explicit that the duty of the business leaders is, \"to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in the law and those embodied in ethical custom\".<ref name=f1970>Friedman, M.

These policies can be simple exhortations in broad, highly generalized language (typically called a corporate ethics statement), or they can be more detailed policies, containing specific behavioural requirements (typically called corporate ethics codes). They are generally meant to identify the company's expectations of workers and to offer guidance on handling some of the more common ethical problems that might arise in the course of doing business. It is hoped that having such a policy will lead to greater ethical awareness, consistency in application, and the avoidance of ethical disasters.\n\nAn increasing number of companies{{Who|date=November 2017}} also require employees to attend seminars regarding business conduct, which often include discussion of the company's policies, specific case studies, and legal requirements. Some companies even require their employees to sign agreements stating that they will abide by the company's rules of conduct.\n\nMany companies{{Who|date=November 2017}} are assessing the environmental factors that can lead employees to engage in unethical conduct. A competitive business environment may call for unethical behaviour. Lying has become expected in fields such as trading. An example of this are the issues surrounding the unethical actions of the [[Salomon Brothers]].\n\nNot everyone{{Who|date=November 2017}} supports corporate policies that govern ethical conduct. Some claim that ethical problems are better dealt with by depending upon employees to use their own judgment.\n\nOthers{{Who|date=November 2017}} believe that corporate ethics policies are primarily rooted in utilitarian concerns, and that they are mainly to limit the company's legal liability, or to curry public favour by giving the appearance of being a good corporate citizen. Ideally, the company will avoid a lawsuit because its employees will follow the rules. Should a lawsuit occur, the company can claim that the problem would not have arisen if the employee had only followed the code properly.\n\nSometimes there is disconnection between the company's code of ethics and the company's actual practices{{Who|date=November 2017}}. Thus, whether or not such conduct is explicitly sanctioned by management, at worst, this makes the policy duplicitous, and, at best, it is merely a marketing tool.\n\nJones and Parker write, \"Most of what we read under the name business ethics is either sentimental common sense, or a set of excuses for being unpleasant.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jones, Parker, et al.|2005}}</ref> Many manuals are procedural form filling exercises unconcerned about the real ethical dilemmas. For instance, US Department of Commerce ethics program treats business ethics as a set of instructions and procedures to be followed by 'ethics officers'.,<ref name=program/> some others claim being ethical is just for the sake of being ethical.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones, Parker, et al.|2005|pp=3\u20138}}</ref> Business ethicists may trivialize the subject, offering standard answers that do not reflect the situation's complexity.<ref name=ag43/>\n\nAuthor of 'Business Ethics,' Richard DeGeorge writes in regard to the importance of maintaining a corporate code, \"Corporate codes have a certain usefulness and there are several advantages to developing them. First, the very exercise of doing so in itself is worthwhile, especially if it forces a large number of people in the firm to think through, in a fresh way, their mission and the important obligations they as a group and as individuals have to the firm, to each other, to their clients and customers, and to society as a whole. Second, once adopted a code can be used to generate continuing discussion and possible modification to the code. Third, it could help to inculcate in new employees at all levels the perspective of responsibility, the need to think in moral terms about their actions, and the importance of developing the virtues appropriate to their position.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=DeGeorge|first=Richard|title=Business Ethics|publisher=Prentice Hall|pages=207\u2013208}}</ref>\n\n===Ethics officers===\nFollowing a series of fraud, corruption, and abuse scandals that affected the United States defense industry in the mid-1980s, the Defense Industry Initiative (DII) was created to promote ethical business practices and ethics management in multiple industries. Subsequent to these scandals, many organizations began appointing ethics officers (also referred to as \"compliance\" officers). In 1991, the [[Ethics & Compliance Officer Association]] (ECOA)\u2014originally the Ethics Officer Association (EOA)\u2014was founded at the [[Center for Business Ethics]] at [[Bentley University]] as a professional association for ethics and compliance officers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937450119|title=Business ethics : ethical decision making and cases|last=Fraedrich|first=John|last2=Ferrell|first2=Linda|last3=Ferrell|first3=O.C.|isbn=1305500849|pages=11\u201313|oclc=937450119}}</ref>\n\nThe 1991 passing of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations in 1991 was another factor in many companies appointing ethics/compliance officers. These guidelines, intended to assist judges with sentencing, set standards organizations must follow to obtain a reduction in sentence if they should be convicted of a federal offense.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937450119|title=Business ethics : ethical decision making and cases|last=Fraedrich|first=John|last2=Ferrell|first2=Linda|last3=Ferrell|first3=O.C.|isbn=1305500849|pages=12\u201316|oclc=937450119}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the high-profile corporate scandals of companies like [[Enron]], [[WorldCom]] and [[Tyco International|Tyco]] between 2001 and 2004, and following the passage of the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]], many small and mid-sized companies also began to appoint ethics officers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937450119|title=Business ethics : ethical decision making and cases|last=Fraedrich|first=John|last2=Ferrell|first2=Linda|last3=Ferrell|first3=O.C.|isbn=1305500849|pages=12\u201314|oclc=937450119}}</ref>\n\nOften reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, ethics officers focus on uncovering or preventing unethical and illegal actions. This is accomplished by assessing the ethical implications of the company's activities, making recommendations on ethical policies, and disseminating information to employees.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937450119|title=Business ethics : ethical decision making and cases|last=Fraedrich|first=John|last2=Ferrell|first2=Linda|last3=Ferrell|first3=O.C.|isbn=1305500849|pages=228\u2013229|oclc=937450119}}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of ethics officers is not clear. The establishment of an ethics officer position is likely to be insufficient in driving ethical business practices without a [[Organizational culture|corporate culture]] that values ethical behavior. These values and behaviors should be consistently and systemically supported by those at the top of the organization.<ref>\"Business Ethics: Ethical Decision making and Cases\", Ferrell Fredrich and Ferrell.</ref> Employees with strong community involvement, loyalty to employers, superiors or owners, smart work practices, trust among the team members do inculcate a corporate culture<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bba12.weebly.com/uploads/9/4/2/8/9428277/9781133816300.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221053014/http://bba12.weebly.com/uploads/9/4/2/8/9428277/9781133816300.pdf |archive-date=2016-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>\"Business Ethics: Ethical Decision making and cases\", 9e, Ferrell Faredrich, Ferrell.</ref>\n\n===Sustainability Initiatives===\nMany corporate and business strategies now include [[sustainability]]. In addition to the traditional environmental 'green' sustainability concerns, business ethics practices have expanded to include [[social sustainability]]. Social sustainability focuses on issues related to human capital in the business supply chain, such as [[worker's rights]], working conditions, [[Child labour|child labor]], and [[human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/545/social-sustainability|title=Social Sustainability - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> Incorporation of these considerations is increasing, as consumers and procurement officials demand documentation of a business' compliance with national and international [https://sftool.gov/plan/546/social-sustainability-initiatives-guidelines-standards initiatives, guidelines, and standards]. Many industries have organizations dedicated to verifying ethical delivery of products from start to finish,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/541/verifying-delivery-sustainable-products-services|title=Verifying Delivery of Sustainable Products and Services - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> such as the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Kimberly Process]], which aims to stop the flow of conflict diamonds into international markets, or the [[Fair Wear Foundation]], dedicated to sustainability and fairness in the garment industry.\n\nAs mentioned, initiatives in sustainability encompass \u201cgreen\u201d topics, as well as social sustainability. There are however many different ways in which sustainability initiatives can be implemented in a company.\n\nImproving Operations: Perhaps the most evident manner in which an organization can implement sustainability initiatives is by improving its operations and manufacturing\u2019s process so as to make it more aligned with environment, social, and governance issues.  Johnson & Johnson incorporates policies from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, applying these principles not only for members of its supply chain but also internal operations. Walmart has made commitments to doubling its truck fleet efficiency by 2015 by replacing 2/3rds of its fleet with more fuel-efficient trucks, including hybrids. Dell has integrated alternative, recycled, and recyclable materials in its products and packaging design, improving energy efficiency and design for end-of-life and recyclability. Dell plans to reduce the energy intensity of its product portfolio by 80% by 2020.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/best-practices-sustainability-us-corporations-ceres</ref>\n\nBoard Leadership: The board of a company can decide to lower executive compensation by a given percentage, and give the percentage of compensation to a specific cause. This is an effort which can only be implemented from the top, as it will affect the compensation of all executives in the company. In Alcoa, an aluminum company based in the USA, \u201c1/5th of executive cash compensation is tied to safety, diversity, and environmental stewardship, which includes greenhouse gas emission reductions and energy efficiency\u201d (Best Practices). This is not usually the case for most companies, where we see the board take a uniform step towards environment, social, and governance issues. This is only the case for companies that are directly linked to utilities, energy, or material industries, something which Alcoa as an aluminum company, falls in line with. Instead, formal committees focused on environment, social, and governance issues are more usually seen in governance committees and audit committees, rather than the board of directors. \u201cAccording to research analysis done by Pearl Meyer in support of the NACD 2017 Director Compensation Report shows that among 1,400 public companies reviewed, only slightly more than five percent of boards have a designated committee to address ESG issues.\u201d (How compensation can).<ref>https://www.pearlmeyer.com/knowledge-share/article/how-compensation-can-support-improved-environmental-and-social-governance</ref><ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nManagement Accountability: Similar to board leadership, creating steering committees and other types of committees specialized for sustainability, senior executives are identified who are held accountable for meeting and constantly improving sustainability goals.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nExecutive compensation: Introducing bonus schemes that reward executives for meeting non-financial performance goals including safety targets, greenhouse gas emissions, reduction targets, and goals engaging stakeholders to help shape the companies public policy positions. Companies such as Exelon have implemented policies like this.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nStakeholder Engagement: Other companies will keep sustainability within its strategy and goals, presenting findings at shareholder meetings, and actively tracking metrics on sustainability. Companies such as PepsiCo, Heineken, and FIFCO{{clarify|What is FIFCO? Please also replace this jargon acronym with the full term the other times it appears in the article|date=April 2018}} take steps in this direction to implement sustainability initiatives. (Best Practices). Companies such as Coca-Cola have actively tried improve their efficiency of water usage, hiring 3rd party auditors to evaluate their water management approach. FIFCO has also led successfully led water-management initiatives.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nEmployee Engagement: Implementation of sustainability projects through directly appealing to employees (typically through the human resource department) is another option for companies to implement sustainability. This involves integrating sustainability into the company culture, with hiring practices and employee training. General Electric is a company that is taking the lead in implementing initiatives in this manner. Bank of America directly engaged employees by implement LEED (leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified buildings, with a fifth of its building meeting these certifications.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nSupply chain management: Establishing requirements for not only internal operations but also first-tier suppliers as well as second-tier suppliers to help drive environmental and social expectations further down the supply chain. Companies such as Starbucks, FIFCO and Ford Motor Company have implemented requirements that suppliers must meet to win their business. Starbucks has led efforts in engaging suppliers and local communities where they operate to accelerate investment in sustainable farming. Starbucks set a goal of ethically sourcing 100% of its coffee beans by 2015.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nReleasing Studies, Insights, Best Practices and Findings: By revealing decision making data about how sustainability was reached, companies are giving away insights that can help others across the industry and beyond make more sustainable decisions. Nike launched its \u201cmaking app\u201d in 2013 which released data about the sustainability in the materials it was using. This ultimately allows other companies to make more sustainable design decisions and create lower impact products.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\n==Academic discipline==\nAs an academic discipline, business ethics emerged in the 1970s. Since no academic business ethics journals or conferences existed, researchers published in general management journals, and attended general conferences. Over time, specialized peer-reviewed journals appeared, and more researchers entered the field. Corporate scandals in the earlier 2000s increased the field's popularity. As of 2009, sixteen academic journals devoted to various business ethics issues existed, with [[Journal of Business Ethics]] and [[Business Ethics Quarterly]] considered the leaders.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1504/IJBGE.2009.023790|accessdate=2009-10-21|url=http://www.aserenko.com/papers/IJBGE040405_PUBLISHED.pdf|author1=Serenko, A.|author2=Bontis, N.|lastauthoramp=yes|year=2009|title=A citation-based ranking of the business ethics scholarly journals|journal=International Journal of Business Governance and Ethics|volume=4|issue=4|pages=390\u2013399}}</ref>\n\n[[The International Business Development Institute]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdinstitute.org|title=IBD Institute|publisher=IBD Institute|accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref> is a global non-profit organization that represents 217 nations and all 50 United States.

The governing Board of BSI establishes a Standards Board.  The Standards Board does little apart from setting up Sector Boards (a Sector in BSI parlance being a field of standardization such as ICT, Quality, Agriculture, Manufacturing, or Fire).  Each Sector Board in turn constitutes several Technical Committees.  It is the Technical Committees that, formally, approve a British Standard, which is then presented to the Secretary of the supervisory Sector Board for endorsement of the fact that the Technical Committee has indeed completed a task for which it was constituted.<ref name=Schepel2005 />\n\n== The standards ==\nThe standards produced are titled '''British Standard XXXX[-P]:YYYY''' where XXXX is the number of the standard, P is the number of the part of the standard (where the standard is split into multiple parts) and YYYY is the year in which the standard came into effect.  '''BSI Group''' currently has over 27,000 active standards. Products are commonly specified as meeting a particular British Standard, and in general this can be done without any certification or independent testing. The standard simply provides a shorthand way of claiming that certain specifications are met, while encouraging manufacturers to adhere to a common method for such a specification.\n\nThe [[Kitemark]] can be used to indicate certification by BSI, but only where a [[Kitemark]] scheme has been set up around a particular standard. It is mainly applicable to safety and quality management standards. There is a common misunderstanding that Kitemarks are necessary to prove compliance with any BS standard, but in general it is neither desirable nor possible that every standard be 'policed' in this way.\n\nFollowing the move on [[harmonisation of law|harmonisation]] of the standard in Europe, some British Standards are gradually superseded or replaced by the relevant [[List of EN standards|European Standards]] (EN).\n\n== Status of standards ==\n\nStandards are continuously reviewed and developed and are periodically allocated one or more of the following status keywords.<ref>[http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/Help/Step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-use-the-BSI-Shop/ Guide to using the BSI shop (retrieved 26-Jan-2013)]</ref>\n\n*'''Confirmed''' -

A PAS is a sponsored piece of work allowing organizations flexibility in the rapid creation of a standard while also allowing for a greater degree of control over the document's development. A typical development time frame for a PAS is around 6\u20139 months. Once published by BSI a PAS has all the functionality of a British Standard for the purposes of creating schemes such as management systems and product benchmarks as well as codes of practice. A PAS is a living document and after two years the document will be reviewed and a decision made with the client as to whether or not this should be taken forward to become a formal British standard.  The term PAS was originally an acronym derived from \"product approval specification\", a name which was subsequently changed to \u201cpublicly available specification\u201d.  However, according to BSI, not all PAS documents are structured as specifications and the term is now sufficiently well established not to require any further amplification.\n\n===Examples===\n\n* [[PAS 78|PAS 78: Guide to good practice in commissioning accessible websites]]\n* PAS 72 Responsible Fishing - Specification of good practice for fishing vessels\n* PAS 77 IT Service continuity management code of practice\n* PAS 82 Shopfitting and interior contracting.

Building societies offer [[banking institution|banking]] and related [[financial services]], especially savings and [[mortgage loan|mortgage lending]]. Building societies exist in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia,  and used to exist in Ireland and several Commonwealth countries. They are similar to [[credit union]]s in organisation, though few enforce a [[Bond of association|common bond]]. However, rather than promoting thrift and offering unsecured and business loans, the purpose of a building society is to provide home mortgages to members. Borrowers and depositors are society members, setting policy and appointing directors on a one-member, one-vote basis. Building societies often provide other retail banking services, such as current accounts, credit cards and personal loans. The term \"building society\" first arose in the 18th century in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] from [[cooperative banking|cooperative savings]] groups.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, building societies actively compete with banks for most consumer banking services, especially mortgage lending and [[savings account]]s, and regulations permit up to half of their lending to be funded by debt to non-members, allowing societies to access wholesale bond and money markets to fund mortgages. The world's largest building society is Britain's [[Nationwide Building Society]]. Further, in Australia, building societies also compete with retail banks and offer the full range of banking services to consumers.\n\n== History in the United Kingdom ==\nBuilding societies as an institution began in late-18th century [[Birmingham]] - a town which was undergoing rapid economic and physical expansion driven by a multiplicity of small metalworking firms, whose many highly skilled and prosperous owners readily invested in property.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Herbert|title=The Building Society Story|year=1980|publisher=Franey & Co.|location=London|isbn=0-900382-38-4|page=4}}; {{Cite book|last=Berg|first=Maxine|editor=Berg, Maxine|title=Markets and Manufacture in Early Industrial Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfkNAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=7 September 2010|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-03720-4|page=194|chapter=Commerce and Creativity in Eighteenth-Century Birmingham|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfkNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA173}}</ref> Many of the early building societies were based in [[tavern]]s or [[coffeehouse]]s, which had become the focus for a network of clubs and societies for co-operation and the exchange of ideas among Birmingham's highly active citizenry as part of the movement known as the [[Midlands Enlightenment]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter M.|title=Industrial Enlightenment: Science, technology and culture in Birmingham and the West Midlands, 1760\u20131820|year=2009|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0-7190-7770-2|page=65}}; {{Cite news|first=Carl|last=Chinn|title=Brum's building society origins|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brum's+building+society+origins-a0188546654857|work=Strabane Mail|publisher=Birmingham Post and Mail Ltd.|date=15 November 2008|accessdate=6 September 2010}}</ref> The first building society to be established was [[Ketley's Building Society]], founded by Richard Ketley, the landlord of the ''Golden Cross'' inn, in 1775.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk/consumer/factsheets/100009.htm|title=The History of Building Societies|accessdate=6 September 2010|last=Rex|first=Simon|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Building Societies Association}}; {{Cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Herbert|title=The Building Society Story|year=1980|publisher=Franey & Co.|location=London|isbn=0-900382-38-4|page=2}}</ref> Members of Ketley's society paid a monthly subscription to a central pool of funds which was used to finance the building of houses for members, which in turn acted as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] to attract further funding to the society, enabling further construction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Christopher L.|date=October 1991|publisher=|title=Truth, Understanding, and High-Cost Consumer Credit: The Historical Context of the Truth in Lending Act|journal=Florida Law Review|issue=55|pages=839\u2013840}}</ref> By 1781 three more societies had been established in Birmingham, with a fourth in the nearby town of [[Dudley]]; and 19 more formed in Birmingham between 1782 and 1795.<ref>{{Citation|last=Clark|first=Peter|year=2002|title=British Clubs and Societies 1580\u20131800: The Origins of an Associational World|publication-place=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=129|isbn=0-19-924843-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h18rP1hrNLQC&pg=PA129|accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> The first outside the [[English Midlands]] was established in [[Leeds]] in 1785.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cleary|first=E.

The main legislative framework for the building society was the [[Building Societies Act 1874]], with subsequent amending legislation in 1894, 1939 (see [[Coney Hall]]), and 1960.\n\nIn their heyday, there were hundreds of building societies: just about every town in the country had a building society named after that town. Over succeeding decades the number of societies has decreased, as various societies merged to form larger ones, often renaming in the process, and other societies opted for [[Demutualization|demutualisation]] followed by \u2013 in the great majority of cases \u2013 eventual takeover by a listed bank. Most of the existing larger building societies are the end result of the mergers of many smaller societies.\n\nAll building societies in the UK are members of the [[Building Societies Association]]. At the start of 2008, there were 59 building societies in the UK, with total assets exceeding \u00a3360 billion.<ref name=multiple>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk |title=Building Societies Association |publisher=Bsa.org.uk |date= |accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref> The number of societies in the UK fell by four during 2008 due to a series of mergers brought about, to a large extent, by the consequences of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]]. With three further mergers in each of 2009 and 2010, and a demutualisation and a merger in 2011, there are now 44 building societies.\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nIn the 1980s, changes to British banking laws allowed building societies to offer banking services equivalent to normal banks. The management of a number of societies still felt that they were unable to compete with the banks, and a new [[Building Societies Act 1986|Building Societies Act]] was passed in 1986 in response to their concerns. This permitted societies to '[[Demutualization|demutualise]]'. If more than 75% of members voted in favour, the building society would then become a [[limited company]] like any other. Members' mutual rights were exchanged for shares in this new company. A number of the larger societies made such proposals to their members and all were accepted. Some listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]], while others were acquired by larger financial groups.\n\nThe process began with the demutualisation of the Abbey National Building Society in 1989. Then, from 1995 to late 1999, eight societies demutualised accounting for two-thirds of building societies assets as at 1994. Five of these societies became joint stock banks (plc), one merged with another and the other four were taken over by plcs (in two cases after the mutual had previously converted to a plc).\n\nAs Tayler (2003) mentions, demutualisation moves succeeded immediately because neither Conservative nor Labour party UK governments created a framework which put obstacles in the way of demutualisation. Political acquiescence in demutualisation was clearest in the case of the position on 'carpet baggers', that is those who joined societies by lodging minimum amounts of \u00a3100 or so in the hope of profiting from a distribution of surplus after demutualisation. The deregulating [[Building Societies Act 1986]] contained an anti-carpet bagger provision in the form of a two-year rule. This prescribed a qualifying period of two years before savers could participate in a residual claim. But, before the 1989 Abbey National Building Society demutualisation, the courts found against the two-year rule after legal action brought by Abbey National itself to circumvent the intent of the legislators. After this the legislation did prevent a cash distribution to members of less than two years standing, but the same result was obtained by permitting the issue of 'free' shares in the acquiring plc, saleable for cash. The Thatcher Conservative government declined to introduce amending legislation to make good the defect in the 'two-year rule'.\n\nBuilding societies, like mutual life insurers, arose as people clubbed together to address a common need interest; in the case of the building societies, this was housing and members were originally both savers and borrowers. But it very quickly became clear that 'outsider' savers were needed whose motive was profit through interest on deposits. Thus permanent building societies quickly became mortgage banks and in such institutions there always existed a conflict of interest between borrowers and savers. It was the task of the movement to reconcile that conflict of interest so as to enable savers to conclude that their interests and those of borrowers were to some extent complementary rather than conflictive. Conflict of interest between savers and borrowers was never fully reconciled in the building societies but upon deregulation that reconciliation became something of a lost cause. The management of building societies apparently could expend considerable time and resources (which belonged the organisation) planning their effective capture\u2014of as much of the assets as they could. If so, this is arguably insider dealing on a grand scale with the benefit of inside specialist knowledge of the business and resources of the firm not shared with outsiders like politicians and members (and, perhaps, regulators). Once the opportunity to claim was presented by management the savers in particular could be relied upon to seize it. There were sufficient hard up borrowers to take the inducement offered them by management (in spite of few simple sums sufficing to demonstrate that they were probably going to end up effectively paying back the inducement). (Tayler 2003)\n\nManagements promoting demutualisation also thereby met managerial objectives because the end of mutuality brought joint stock company (plc) style remuneration committee pay standards and share options. Share options for management of converting societies appear to be a powerful factor in management calculation. Rasmusen (1988) refers to this in the following terms:\n\" ... perks do not rise in proportion to [mutual] bank size. If a mutual is large, or is expected to grow if it can raise capital by a conversion, its managers derive more value from a conversion but do not suffer much loss of perks than if the bank were small. Their benefit is in the right to purchase the new stock, which are valuable because the new issues are consistently underpriced [referring to USA mutual bank conversions]. Moreover, by no means are all mutual managers incompetent, and conversions allows the bank to expand more easily and to grant executive stock options that are valuable to skilled managers\".\n\nInstead of deploying their margin advantage as a defence of mutuality, around 1980 building societies began setting mortgage rates with reference to market clearing levels. In sum they began behaving more like banks, seeking to maximise profit instead of the advantages of a mutual organisation. Thus, according to the Bank of England's Boxall and Gallagher (1997), \"... there was virtually no difference between banks and building society 'listed' interest rates for home finance mortgage lending between 1984 and 1997. This behaviour resulted in a return on assets for building societies which was at least as high as Plc banks and, in the absence of distribution, led to rapid accumulation of reserves\". As Boxall and Gallagher (1997) also observe; \"... accumulation of reserves in the early-1990s, beyond regulatory and future growth requirements, is difficult to reconcile with conventional theories of mutual behaviour\".\n\nLlewellyn (1996) draws a rather more direct and cynical conclusion:\n\n{{quote|By adopting a policy of building up reserves by maintaining an excess margin, building societies simultaneously allowed banks to compete and may have undermined the long run viability of mutuality. A more cynical approach is that some societies may have adopted an excess-margin strategy simply to enhance their value for conversion.}}\n\nSome of these managements ended up in dispute with their own members. Of the first major conversion of the Abbey in 1989, Kay (1991) observed:\n\n{{quote|[T]he paradox of the Abbey members who campaigned against flotation [conversion to a Plc bank] of their building society. They were fighting to preserve a degree of accountability to the membership which the management of the Society patently did not feel. For incumbent management, the contrary views of some of their members were not matters to be weighed in the balance and taken account of in formulation of policy. They were a nuisance to be dealt with by the costly use of public relations advisers and legal processes.}}\n\nIn the end, after a number of large demutualisations, and pressure from carpetbaggers moving from one building society to another to cream off the windfalls, most of the societies whose management wished to keep them mutual modified their rules of membership in the late 1990s. The method usually adopted were membership rules to ensure that anyone newly joining a society would, for the first few years, be unable to get any profit out of a demutualisation. With the chance of a quick profit removed, the wave of demutualisations came to an end in 2000.\n\nOne academic study (Heffernan, 2003) found that demutualised societies' pricing behaviour on deposits and mortgages was more favourable to shareholders than to customers, with the remaining mutual building societies offering consistently better rates.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Effect of UK Building Society Conversion on Pricing Behaviour (March 2003) |author=Shelagh Heffernan |publisher=Faculty of Finance, CASS Business School, City of London |url=http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/facfin/papers/WP2003/Mutuals-WP.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=10 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129143345/http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/facfin/papers/WP2003/Mutuals-WP.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\nThe [[Building Societies (Funding) and Mutual Societies (Transfers) Act 2007]], known as the Butterfill Act, was passed in 2007 giving building societies greater powers to merge with other companies. These powers have been used by the [[Britannia Building Society|Britannia]] in 2009 and [[Kent Reliance Building Society|Kent Reliance]] in 2011 leading to their demutualisation.\n\nPrior to 31 December 2010, deposits with building societies of up to \u00a350,000 per individual, per institution, were normally protected by the [[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]] (FSCS), but Nationwide and Yorkshire Building Societies negotiated a temporary change to the terms of the FSCS to protect members of the societies they acquired in late 2008/early 2009. The amended terms allowed former members of multiple societies which merge into one to maintain multiple entitlements to FSCS protection until 30 September 2009 (later extended to 30 December 2010), so (for example) a member with \u00a350,000 in each of Nationwide, Cheshire and Derbyshire at the time of the respective mergers would retain \u00a3150,000 of FSCS protection for their funds in the merged Nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk/news/product/bs_merger_compensation.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081230233437/http%3A//www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk/news/product/bs_merger_compensation.html |archivedate=30 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 31 December 2010 the general FSCS limit for retail deposits was increased to \u00a385,000 for banks and building societies and the transitional arrangements in respect of building society mergers came to an end.\n\n==List of building societies==\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====Current====\nThe remaining building societies are:\n\n(Total group assets of building societies) ''(data from last available annual reports as of Dec 2016)''\n\nSource: [[Building Societies Association]]<ref name=\"multiple\"></ref> updated for subsequent mergers\n\n{| style=\"width:125%;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:0%;\"|\n! style=\"width:0%;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:0%;\" align=center | Group assets<ref>[https://www.bsa.org.uk/statistics/sector-info-performance/sector-information] Building Societies Fact Sheet - Building Societies Association.

societies evolved along British lines. Following end of World War II, the terminating model was revived to fund returning serviceman's need for new houses. Hundreds were created with government seed capital whereby the capital was returned to the government and the terminating societies retained the interest accumulated. Once all the seed funds were loaned each terminating society could reapply for more seed capital to the point where they could re-lend their own funds and thus became a permanent society. Terminating loans were still available and used inside the permanent businesses by staff up until the 1980s because their existence was not widely known after the early 1960s. Because of strict regulations on banks, building societies flourished until the deregulation of the Australian financial industry in the 1980s. Eventually many of the smaller building societies disappeared, while some of the largest (such as [[St. George Bank|St. George]]) officially attained the status of banks. Recent conversions have included [[Heritage Bank]] which converted from building society to bank in 2011, [[Hume Bank|Hume]] in 2014, while Wide Bay Building Society became [[Auswide Bank]] and [[IMB Banking & Financial Services|IMB]] followed suit in 2015 Greater Building Society became [[Greater Bank]] in 2016. Building societies converting to banks are no longer required to demutualise.\n\nA particular difference between Australian building societies and those elsewhere, is that Australian building societies are required to incorporate as [[limited companies]].\n\nCurrent building societies are\n*[[Bass & Equitable Building Society]] (Tasmania)\n*[[Big Sky Building Society]]\n*[[Maitland Mutual Building Society]] (Maitland)\n*[[Newcastle Permanent Building Society]] (Newcastle)\n\n=== Ireland ===\nThe [[Republic of Ireland]] had around 40 building societies at the mid-20th century peak.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibf.ie/Libraries/Guides_Forms/bsnames_1.sflb.ashx |title=List of Building Society Changes |publisher=Irish Banking Federation |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Many of these were very small and, as the Irish commercial banks began to originate residential mortgages, the small building societies ceased to be competitive.

It allowed the bomber to launch the missile against its target while still outside the range of [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs). The missile proceeded to the target at speeds up to [[Mach number|Mach]] 3, and would trigger within 100&nbsp;m of the pre-defined target point.\n\nBlue Steel entered service in 1963, by which point improved SAMs with longer range had greatly eroded the advantages of the design. A longer-range version, Blue Steel II, was considered, but cancelled in favour of the much longer-range [[GAM-87 Skybolt]] system from the US. When development of that system was cancelled in 1962, the V-bomber fleet was considered highly vulnerable. Blue Steel remained the primary British nuclear deterrent weapon until the [[Royal Navy]] started operating [[Polaris missile|Polaris]] ballistic missiles from [[Resolution-class submarine|''Resolution''-class submarines]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Avro blue steel front 9m07.JPG|right|thumb|Avro Blue Steel nuclear missile (front) at the [[Midland Air Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midlandairmuseum.co.uk/aircraft.php| title= Midland Air Museum|accessdate = 16 March 2007 }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Avro blue steel side 9m07.JPG|right|thumb|Avro Blue Steel missile (side view) at the Midland Air Museum behind the wing of an Avro Vulcan bomber]]\n[[File:BlueSteelMissileRear.JPG|right|thumb|Rear view of Blue Steel missile at [[RAF Cosford]] aerospace museum, showing the twin-chamber \"Stentor\" rocket motor]]\n\nBlue Steel was the result of a [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] memorandum from 5 November 1954 that predicted that by 1960 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] air defences would make it impossible for V bombers to attack with nuclear [[gravity bomb]]s. The answer was for a [[rocket engine|rocket-powered]], [[supersonic]] missile capable of carrying a large nuclear (or projected [[thermonuclear]]) [[warhead]] with a range of at least {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}}. This would keep the bombers out of range of Soviet ground-based defences installed around the target area, allowing the missile to \"dash\" in at high speed.\n\nThere would have to be a balance between the size of the warhead, the need for it to be carried by any of the three V-bomber types in use, and that it should be able to reach Mach 3. At the time the only strategic warhead available in the UK was the [[Green Bamboo]], which was very large and so required a large missile fuselage to carry it. The [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued this requirement for a ''stand-off bomb'' as OR.1132 in September 1954.<ref name=\"BSP\">Gibson, Buttler T ''British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles'' Midland Publishing 2007</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of Supply selected [[Avro]] out of the British manufacturers, although it had no experience in working on guided weapons other than some private venture work; [[Handley Page]] had suggested a {{convert|500|nmi|km|abbr=on}} missile, but the [[Elliott Brothers (computer company)|Elliots]] gyro based guidance system was inaccurate beyond {{convert|100|nmi|km|abbr=on}}. Avro began work proper in 1955, with the assigned [[Rainbow Code]] name of \"Blue Steel\" which it would keep in service. With Elliots working on the guidance system, [[Armstrong Siddeley]] would develop the liquid fuel engine. The design period was protracted, with various development problems exacerbated by the fact that designers lacked information on the actual size and weight of the proposed [[boosted fission weapon|boosted fission warhead]] Green Bamboo, or its likely thermonuclear successor derived from the Granite series. The large girth of Blue Steel was determined by the {{convert|45|in|m}} implosion sphere diameter of Green Bamboo.\n\nAvro proposed that Blue Steel would evolve over time, subsequent versions increasing speed (to Mach 4.5) and range. The ultimate Blue Steel would be a {{convert|900|nmi|km|abbr=on}} range weapon that could be launched by the supersonic [[Avro 730]] under development. They were told to limit themselves to the specification of OR.1132.<ref name=\"BSP\"/> The project was delayed by the need to develop the required [[stainless steel]] fabrication techniques; this would have been gained in building the Avro 730 but that had been cancelled by then. The Elliots guidance system was plagued by accuracy problems, delaying test flights.\n\nAs it turned out, neither of the originally-proposed UK-designed warheads were actually fitted, being superseded by [[Red Snow]], an Anglicised variant of the U.S. [[B28 nuclear bomb|W-28 thermonuclear warhead]] of 1.1 Mt yield. Red Snow was smaller and lighter than the earlier warhead proposals. The missile was fitted with a state-of-the-art [[inertial navigation]] unit. This system allowed the missile to strike within 100 metres of its designated target. In addition, the pilots of the [[Avro Vulcan]] or [[Handley Page Victor]] bombers could tie their systems into those of the missile and make use of the guidance system to help plot their own flight plan, since the unit in the missile was more advanced than that in the aircraft.\n\nBlue Steel emerged as a pilotless, winged aircraft roughly the size of the experimental [[Saunders-Roe SR.53]] [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]], with clipped [[delta wing]]s and small [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] foreplanes. It was powered by a two-chamber [[Armstrong Siddeley]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Stentor|Stentor Mark 101]] rocket engine, burning a combination of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[kerosene]]. The fuel was a considerable operational problem, because fuelling the missile before launch took nearly half an hour, and was quite hazardous.  It required the fuelling site to be flooded with water, and (during the trials campaigns) very early morning preparations because of the heat experienced during Australian summer. Another issue was the very small ground clearance when attached to the Handley Page Victor, and Victor aircrews were especially aware of the dangers when taking off.  (The Vulcan had a much higher ground clearance, and ultimately proved a better platform).\n\nOn launch the rocket engine's first chamber developing {{convert|24000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust would power the missile along a predetermined course to the target at around [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.5. Once close to the target, the second chamber of the engine (6,000&nbsp;lb) would accelerate the missile to Mach 3. Over the target the engine would cut out and the missile would free-fall before detonating its warhead as an [[air burst]].\n\nTo speed the trials at [[Woomera Test Range|Woomera]], the test rounds were flown there by Victors and Vulcans in Operation Blue Ranger. The trials began in 1960 about the time the original requirement expected the weapon to be in service.  The missiles were prepared at the Weapons Research Establishment near Salisbury South Australia, and flown to be launched at the Woomera range from RAAF Edinburgh. A specialist RAF unit, 4 JSTU, was established to carry out preparatory and operational tasks.\n\nBlue Steel finally entered service in February [[1963 in aviation|1963]], carried by [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcans]] and [[Handley Page Victor|Victors]], although its limitations were already apparent. The short range of the missile meant that the V bombers were still vulnerable to enemy [[surface-to-air missile]]s. A replacement for Blue Steel, the Mark 2, was planned with increased range and a [[ramjet]] engine, but was cancelled in [[1960 in aviation|1960]] to minimise delays to the Mk.1. The UK sought to acquire the much longer-ranged [[United States Air Force]] [[AGM-48 Skybolt]] air-launched ballistic missile, and was greatly frustrated when that weapon was cancelled in late [[1962 in aviation|1962]].\n\nBlue Steel required up to seven hours of launch preparation, and was highly unreliable. The Royal Air Force estimated in 1963 that half the missiles would fail to fire and would have to be dropped over their targets, contradicting their purpose of serving as standoff weapons. Even as it deployed Blue Steel, a high-altitude weapon, that year the government decided that because of anti-aircraft missiles' increasing effectiveness, V bombers would have to convert from high-altitude to low-altitude attacks.  These trials were conducted in 1964  and concluded in 1965<ref name=\"baylis1995\">{{cite book | title=Ambiguity and Deterrence: British Nuclear Strategy 1945-1964 | publisher=Clarendon Press | author=Baylis, John | year=1995 | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-828012-2}}</ref>{{rp|349\u2013351}} With no effective long-range weapon the original Blue Steel served on after a crash programme of minor modifications to permit a low-level launch at {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, even though its usefulness in a hot war was likely limited. A stop-gap weapon ([[WE.177]]B) was quickly produced to extend the life of the V-bomber force in the strategic role until the Polaris missile was deployed. This WE.177 [[Laydown delivery|laydown weapon]] supplemented the remaining modified Blue Steel missiles, using a low-level penetration followed by a pop-up manoeuvre to release the weapon at {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

The Branch group was initially led by [[Benjamin Roden]].  Branch Davidians are most associated with the [[Waco siege]] of 1993, which involved [[David Koresh]].\n\nThe doctrinal beliefs of the Branch Davidians differ on teachings such as the [[Holy Spirit]] and his nature, and the feast days and their requirements. Both groups have disputed the relevance of the other's spiritual authority based on the proceedings following Victor Houteff's death. From its inception in 1930, the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod group believed themselves to be living in a time when [[Bible|Biblical]] prophecies of a final divine judgment were coming to pass as a prelude to Christ's [[Second Coming]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, Koresh and his followers abandoned many Branch Davidian teachings. Koresh became the group's self-proclaimed final prophet. \"Koreshians\" were the majority resulting from the schism among the Branch Davidians, but some of the Branch Davidians did not join Koresh's group and instead gathered around [[George Roden]] or became independent. Following a series of violent shootouts between Roden's and Koresh's group, the Mount Carmel compound was eventually taken over by the \"Koreshians\". In 1993, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] and [[Texas Army National Guard]] raided one of the properties belonging to a [[new religious movement]] centered around [[David Koresh]] that evolved from the Branch Davidians for suspected weapons violations. This raid resulted in a two-hour firefight in which four ATF agents were killed; this was followed by a [[Waco siege|standoff]] with the FBI that lasted for 51 days. The siege ended with a raid that resulted in the deaths of Koresh and 82 of his followers.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120472/ |title= Waco: The Rules of Engagement (1997) |author1= Gazecki, William |author2= Gifford, Dan |author3= McNulty, Michael |work= Film Documentary |publisher= [[IMDb]] \u2013 Internet Movie Database |accessdate= 25 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= The Branch Davidians of Waco: The History and Beliefs of an Apocalyptic Sect|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-branch-davidians-of-waco-9780199245741?cc=au&lang=en&#.UFG2XbJlRK4 |author1= Newport, Kenneth G.C. |date= June 22, 2006 |publisher= Oxford University Press  |ISBN= 978-0199245741 |accessdate= 25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Early history ==\nIn 1929, [[Victor Houteff]], a [[Bulgaria]]n [[immigrant]] and a [[Seventh-day Adventist]] [[Sabbath School]] teacher in a local church in Southern California, claimed that he had a new message for the entire church.

Howell wanted a child with her, who, according to his understanding, would be the Chosen One. When she died, her son [[George Roden]] inherited the position of prophet and leader of the commune.

This illegal activity gave Howell an opportunity to attempt to file charges against Roden, however he was told he needed evidence. This led to the November 3, 1987 raid on the Mount Carmel Center by Howell and 7 of his followers equipped with five .223 caliber semiautomatic rifles, two .22 caliber rifles, two 12-gauge shotguns and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition.

Houteff went on to found the Davidians (a splinter group, otherwise known as the [[Shepherd's Rod]]). Branch Davidians are considered a splinter group from that dissenting group (the Davidians/Shephard's Rod) and came out from a schism among the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod initiated by [[Benjamin Roden]].\n\nBranch Davidian leaders, while still formally members in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, pushed for a reform of the church and when this was met with opposition (from both the common Seventh-day Adventists and also the already excluded Davidians/Shepherd's Rod), they decided to leave that denomination while at the same time widely distancing themselves from the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod (their \"parent group\" that arose earlier and was also excluded for their own attempts to reform the Seventh-day Adventist Church). The Seventh-day Adventist Church deprived both the Branch Davidians and the Davidians of their membership in the denomination, but in spite of this fact the Branch Davidians actively continued to \"hunt\" members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, encouraging them to leave it and join their group instead. The Seventh-day Adventists were reportedly \"apprehensive\" about the group's views as Branch Davidians claimed to be the \"only rightful continuation of the [[Adventism|Adventist message]]\", based on the idea that [[Victor Houteff]] was the divinely selected prophet and successor to [[Ellen G.

Construction began in 1911 and was completed in 1913.  It was named after [[Nathanael Burwash]], a former president of Victoria.  The building is an extravagant [[Neo-Gothic]] work with [[turret]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, and [[battlement]]s.  The architect was [[Henry Sproatt]].\n\nThe building is divided between the large dining hall in the northwest and the student residence proper.  The residence area is divided into two sections.  The Upper Houses, built in 1913, consist of four houses: North House, [[Middle House]], [[Gate House (University of Toronto)|Gate House]], and [[South House]].   The Lower Houses were built in 1931 and were originally intended to house theology students at Emmanuel College, whose current building was opened the same year.  Ryerson House, Nelles House, Caven House, Bowles-Gandier House are now mostly home to undergraduate arts and science students.  The latter two are mostly reserved for students in the new Vic One Programme.\n\nFamous residents of Burwash include [[Vincent Massey]], [[Lester B. Pearson]], [[Don Harron]], and [[Donald Sutherland]].  The upper houses were gutted and renovated in 1995.  The lower houses have only been partially upgraded.  Before the renovations the entire building was all male, but now every house is co-ed.\n\nEach Upper House consists of three floors.  The lower floor contains a [[common room]] equipped with kitchen facilities, couches and a television.  The upper floors each have their own kitchen and dining area.  All except North House have a very high bathroom ratio, with Gate House being the best with nine washrooms for its twenty-eight residents.  Upper Houses are divided between double rooms and singles, with about sixty percent of the population being in doubles.\n\nThe Lower Houses each have four floors, but are much narrower with each level having only four rooms.  Each level also has its own kitchen, but these are much smaller than in the Upper Houses. The Lower Houses do have far larger and better fitted common rooms that are similar to the ones the Upper Houses had before the renovations.  The rooms in the Lower Houses are also considered more luxurious with [[hardwood floor]]s and large sizes. Rooms in the Lower Houses are more expensive, however. Until 2003 the Lower Houses were restricted to upper year students but with the [[double cohort]] of graduates from Ontario schools many of the rooms were transformed into doubles and now hold first years.\n\nTo the west the Upper Houses look out on the Vic Quad and the main Victoria College building across it.  West of the Lower Houses is the new Lester B. Pearson Garden of Peace and International Understanding and the [[E.J. Pratt Library]] beyond it.  From the eastern side of the building, the Upper Houses look out at [[Rowell Jackman Hall]] and the Lower Houses see the [[St. Michael's College (U of T)|St. Michael's College]] residence of [[Elmsley]].  The only exception is the view from Gate House's tower that looks down St. Mary's Street.\n\nThe dining hall is perhaps the best known part of the building to outsiders.  It is the University of Toronto's largest, holding some 250 students and sixteen large tables.  Hanging on the western wall is [[Queen Victoria]]'s burial flag, given to the college soon after her death.  Under the flag is the [[High Table|high table]] where the professors and college administration lunch.  Historically, the Upper Houses each had their own table.  Gate sat in the southwest corner, Middle sat in the far northeast, South sat in the table to the west of Middle, while North sat to the west of the southeast corner. The only lower house to have had a designated table was Caven, in the northwest corner beside the alumni table. (Note that prior to the 1995 renovations, some of these houses, particularly North and Caven, 'traditionally' sat elsewhere)\n\n==Gate House==\n[[Image:Gate House.jpg|thumb|Gate House as viewed from the Victoria Quad.]]\n'''Gate House''' is one of the four Upper Houses of the Burwash Hall residence.

APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, [[SSRI]]s, [[serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]], [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, and psychotherapy should be based on the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing [[benzodiazepine dependence]]. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of [[substance abuse]]. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience supports continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients, stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.<ref name=APA/>\n\nGuidelines issued by the UK-based [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE), carried out a systematic review using different methodology and came to a different conclusion.

So, if all body dimensions double, and mass scales naturally with the cube of the height, then BMI doubles instead of remaining the same. This results in taller people having a reported BMI that is uncharacteristically high, compared to their actual body fat levels. In comparison, the [[Ponderal index]] is based on the natural scaling of mass with the third power of the height.\n\nHowever, many taller people are not just \"scaled up\" short people but tend to have narrower frames in proportion to their height. Carl Lavie has written that, \"The B.M.I. tables are excellent for identifying obesity and body fat in large populations, but they are far less reliable for determining fatness in individuals.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/health/31brod.html|title=Weight Index Doesn&#8217;t Tell the Whole Truth|date=31 August 2010|work=The New York Times|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501153306/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/health/31brod.html|archive-date=1 May 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Categories==\nA frequent use of the BMI is to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person's height.

Conversely, large framed (or tall) individuals may be quite healthy, with a fairly low body fat percentage, but be classified as ''overweight'' by BMI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215.php|title=Why BMI is inaccurate and misleading|work=Medical News Today|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723131349/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215.php|archive-date=2015-07-23}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a height/weight chart may say the ideal weight (BMI 21.5) for a man {{convert|5|ft|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} is {{convert|150|lb|kg}}.

In the reverse, the man with a larger frame and more solid build should increase by 10%, to roughly {{convert|165|lb|kg}} (BMI 23.7). If one teeters on the edge of small/medium or medium/large, common sense should be used in calculating one's ideal weight. However, falling into one's ideal weight range for height and build is still not as accurate in determining health risk factors as waist/height ratio and actual body fat percentage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/255712.php|title=BMI: is the body mass index formula flawed?|work=Medical News Today|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723095030/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/255712.php|archive-date=2015-07-23|df=}}</ref>\n\nAccurate frame size calculators use several measurements (wrist circumference, elbow width, neck circumference and others) to determine what category an individual falls into for a given height.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/39097-bmi-not-accurate-health-measure.html|title=BMI Not a Good Measure of Healthy Body Weight, Researchers Argue|work=LiveScience.com|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721123646/http://www.livescience.com/39097-bmi-not-accurate-health-measure.html|archive-date=2015-07-21|df=}}</ref> The BMI also fails to take into account loss of height through aging. In this situation, BMI will increase without any corresponding increase in weight.\n\n===Does not differentiate between muscle mass and fat mass===\nAssumptions about the distribution between muscle mass and fat mass are inexact. BMI generally overestimates [[adipose tissue|adiposity]] on those with more lean body mass (e.g., athletes) and underestimates excess adiposity on those with less lean body mass. A study in June 2008 by Romero-Corral et al. examined 13,601 subjects from the United States' third [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES III) and found that BMI-defined obesity (BMI > 30) was present in 21% of men and 31% of women.\n\nUsing [[body fat percentage]]s (BF%), however, BF-defined obesity was found in 50% of men and 62% of women. While BMI-defined obesity showed high [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] (95% for men and 99% for women), BMI showed poor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] (36% for men and 49% for women). Despite this undercounting of obesity by BMI, BMI values in the intermediate BMI range of 20\u201330 were found to be associated with a wide range of body fat percentages. For men with a BMI of 25, about 20% have a body fat percentage below 20% and about 10% have body fat percentage above 30%.<ref name=\"RomeroCorral2008\"/>\n\nBMI is particularly inaccurate for people who are very fit or athletic, as their high muscle mass can classify them in the ''overweight'' category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 10\u201315% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a ''normal'' BMI number.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} For example, bodybuilder and eight-time [[Mr. Olympia]] [[Ronnie Coleman]] would be considered [[Classification of obesity|morbidly obese]] based on his BMI of 41.8.<ref>Ronnie Coleman is 5'11\" tall and weighed 300 lbs during competition. {{cite web|title=Ronnie Coleman Pro Bodybuilding Profile, Bodybuilding.com|date=July 22, 2013|url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bodybuilders-ronnie.htm}}</ref>  Body composition for athletes is often better calculated using measures of body fat, as determined by such techniques as skinfold measurements or underwater weighing and the limitations of manual measurement have also led to new, alternative methods to measure obesity, such as the [[body volume index]].\n\n===Variation in definitions of categories===\nIt is not clear where on the BMI scale the threshold for ''[[overweight]]'' and ''[[obesity|obese]]'' should be set. Because of this the standards have varied over the past few decades. Between 1980 and 2000 the U.S. Dietary Guidelines have defined overweight at a variety of levels ranging from a BMI of 24.9 to 27.1. In 1985 the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) consensus conference recommended that overweight BMI be set at a BMI of 27.8 for men and 27.3 for women.\n\nIn 1998 a NIH report concluded that a BMI over 25 is overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/HEALTH/9806/17/weight.guidelines/ |title=Who's fat?

BMI Prime is useful clinically because it shows by what ratio (e.g. 1.36) or percentage (e.g. 136%, or 36% above) a person deviates from the maximum optimal BMI.\n\nFor instance, a person with BMI 34&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> has a BMI Prime of 34/25 = 1.36, and is 36% over their upper mass limit. In South East Asian and South Chinese populations (see [[#International variations|\u00a7 international variations]]) BMI Prime should be calculated using an upper limit BMI of 23 in the denominator instead of 25. BMI Prime allows easy comparison between populations whose upper-limit optimal BMI values differ.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gadzik J | title = \"How much should I weigh?\"--Quetelet's equation, upper weight limits, and BMI prime | journal = Connecticut Medicine | volume = 70 | issue = 2 | pages = 81\u20138 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16768059 }}</ref>\n\n===Waist circumference===\n{{Main|Waist-to-height ratio|Waist-to-hip ratio}}\nWaist circumference is a good indicator of [[visceral fat]], which poses more health risks than fat elsewhere.

It was crucial to the decipherment of [[cuneiform script]].\n\nAuthored by [[Darius the Great]] sometime between his coronation as king of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in the summer of 522 BC and his death in autumn of 486 BC, the inscription begins with a brief autobiography of Darius, including his ancestry and lineage. Later in the inscription, Darius provides a lengthy sequence of events following the deaths of [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Cambyses II]] in which he fought nineteen battles in a period of one year (ending in December 521 BC) to put down multiple rebellions throughout the Persian Empire.  The inscription states in detail that the rebellions, which had resulted from the deaths of Cyrus the Great and his son Cambyses II, were orchestrated by several impostors and their co-conspirators in various cities throughout the empire, each of whom falsely proclaimed kinghood during the upheaval following Cyrus's death.\n\nDarius the Great proclaimed himself victorious in all battles during the period of upheaval, attributing his success to the \"grace of [[Ahura Mazda]]\". The inscription includes three versions of the same text, written in three different [[cuneiform script]] languages: [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] (a variety of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]). The inscription is to [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] what the [[Rosetta Stone]] is to [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s: the document most crucial in the [[decipherment]] of a previously lost [[writing system|script]].\n\nThe inscription is approximately 15&nbsp;metres high by 25&nbsp;metres wide and 100&nbsp;metres up a [[limestone]] cliff from an ancient road connecting the capitals of [[Babylonia]] and [[Medes|Media]] ([[Babylon]] and [[Ecbatana]], respectively). The Old Persian text contains 414 lines in five columns; the Elamite text includes 593 lines in eight columns, and the Babylonian text is in 112 lines. The inscription was illustrated by a life-sized bas-relief of [[Darius the Great|Darius I, the Great]], holding a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] as a sign of kingship, with his left foot on the chest of a figure lying on his back before him.  The supine figure is reputed to be the pretender [[Gaumata]].  Darius is attended to the left by two servants, and nine one-meter figures stand to the right, with hands tied and rope around their necks, representing conquered peoples. A  [[Faravahar]] floats above, giving its blessing to the king. One figure appears to have been added after the others were completed, as was Darius's beard, which is a separate block of stone attached with [[iron]] pins and [[lead]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:BehistunRoute.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The route up to the inscription]]\n\nAfter the fall of the Persian Empire's [[Achaemenid Dynasty]] and its successors, and the lapse of Old Persian cuneiform writing into disuse, the nature of the inscription was forgotten, and fanciful explanations became the norm. For centuries, instead of being attributed to Darius I, the Great, it was believed to be from the reign of [[Khosrau II]] of [[Persia]]\u2014one of the last [[Sassanid]] kings, who lived over 1000 years after the time of Darius I.\n\nThe inscription is mentioned by [[Ctesias|Ctesias of Cnidus]], who noted its existence some time around 400 BC and mentioned a well and a garden beneath the inscription. He incorrectly concluded that the inscription had been dedicated \"by Queen [[Semiramis of Babylon]] to [[Zeus]]\". [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] also mentions it and includes a description of some of the long-lost ancillary monuments at the base of the cliff, including an altar to \"[[Herakles]]\". What has been recovered of them, including a statue dedicated in 148 BC, is consistent with Tacitus's description. [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] also writes of \"Bagistanon\" and claims it was inscribed by Semiramis.\n\nA legend began around [[Mount Behistun]] (Bisotun), as written about by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet and writer]] [[Ferdowsi]] in his ''[[Shahnameh]]'' (''Book of Kings'') {{c.|lk=no|1000}}, about a man named [[Farhad]], who was a lover of King Khosrow's wife, [[Shirin]]. The legend states that, exiled for his transgression, Farhad was given the task of cutting away the mountain to find water; if he succeeded, he would be given permission to marry Shirin. After many years and the removal of half the mountain, he did find water, but was informed by Khosrow that Shirin had died. He went mad, threw his axe down the hill, kissed the ground and died. It is told in the book of [[Khosrow and Shirin]] that his axe was made out of a pomegranate tree, and, where he threw the axe, a pomegranate tree grew with fruit that would cure the ill. Shirin was not dead, according to the story, and mourned upon hearing the news.\n\nIn 1598, the [[England|Englishman]] [[Robert Sherley]] saw the inscription during a diplomatic mission to [[Iran|Persia]] on behalf of [[Austria]], and brought it to the attention of Western European scholars. His party incorrectly came to the conclusion that it was Christian in origin.<ref>E.

As the town of Bisotun's name was anglicized as \"Behistun\" at this time, the monument became known as the \"Behistun Inscription\". Despite its relative inaccessibility, Rawlinson was able to scale the cliff with the help of a local boy and copy the Old Persian inscription. The Elamite was across a chasm, and the Babylonian four meters above; both were beyond easy reach and were left for later.\n\nWith the Persian text, and with about a third of the [[syllabary]] made available to him by the work of [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]], Rawlinson set to work on deciphering the text. The first section of this text contained a list of the same Persian kings found in [[Herodotus]] but in their original Persian forms as opposed to Herodotus's Greek [[transliteration]]s; for example Darius is given as the original ''D\u00e2ryavu\u0161'' instead of the Hellenized ''\u0394\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2''. By matching the names and the characters, Rawlinson deciphered the type of cuneiform used for Old Persian by 1838 and presented his results to the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in [[London]] and the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique]] in [[Paris]].\n\nIn the interim, Rawlinson spent a brief tour of duty in [[Afghanistan]], returning to the site in 1843. He first crossed a chasm between the Persian and Elamite scripts by bridging the gap with planks, subsequently copying the Elamite inscription. He found an enterprising local boy to climb up a crack in the cliff and suspend ropes across the Babylonian writing, so that [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] casts of the inscriptions could be taken. Rawlinson, along with several other scholars, most notably [[Edward Hincks]], [[Julius Oppert]], [[William Henry Fox Talbot]], and [[Edwin Norris]], either working separately or in collaboration, eventually deciphered these inscriptions, leading eventually to the ability to read them completely.\n\nThe translation of the Old Persian sections of the Behistun Inscription paved the way to the subsequent ability to decipher the Elamite and Babylonian parts of the text, which greatly promoted the development of modern [[Assyriology]].\n\n==Later research and activity==\n[[File:BehistunInscriptiondetail.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Close-up of the inscription showing damage]]\n\nThe site was visited by the American linguist [[A.

Barry had never been close to his father, but he took over the family business after Baron's death in 1930. He became a Republican (in a heavily Democratic state), promoted innovative business practices, and opposed the [[New Deal]], especially because it fostered labor unions. Goldwater came to know former President [[Herbert Hoover]], whose conservative politics he admired greatly.\n\n=== Family ===\nIn 1934, he married Margaret \"Peggy\" Johnson, daughter of a prominent industrialist from [[Muncie, Indiana]]. They had four children: Joanne (born January 1, 1936), [[Barry Goldwater Jr.|Barry]] (born July 15, 1938), Michael (born March 15, 1940), and Peggy (born July 27, 1944).

He became a pilot assigned to the Ferry Command, a newly formed unit that flew aircraft and supplies to war zones worldwide. He spent most of the war flying between the U.S. and [[India]], via the [[Azores]] and North Africa or South America, [[Nigeria]], and Central Africa. He also flew \"the hump\" over the [[Himalayas]] to deliver supplies to the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\n\nFollowing World War II, Goldwater was a leading proponent of creating the [[United States Air Force Academy]], and later served on the Academy's Board of Visitors. The visitor center at the Academy is now named in his honor. As a colonel he also founded the [[Arizona Air National Guard]], and he would [[desegregate]] it two years before the rest of the U.S. military. Goldwater was instrumental in pushing the Pentagon to support desegregation of the armed services.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=-EgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&q=goldwater%20and%20the%20desegregation%20of%20the%20arizona%20air%20national%20guard | contribution =Life | publisher = Google | title = Books |date=September 18, 1964 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nRemaining in the Arizona [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve]] after the war, he eventually retired as a [[Command Pilot]] with the rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]].<ref>{{cite web| publisher=U.S. Air Force |title=Major General Barry M Goldwater |url=http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5574|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331211943/http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5574|archivedate=March 31, 2013}}</ref> By that time, he had flown 165 different types of aircraft.

His parents strongly encouraged him to compete in these sports, to Goldwater's dismay. He often went by the nickname of \"Rolling Thunder.\"\n\nIn 1940, Goldwater became one of the first people to run the [[Colorado River]] recreationally through [[Grand Canyon]] participating as an oarsman on [[Norman Nevills]]' second commercial river trip. Goldwater joined them in [[Green River, Utah]], and rowed his own boat down to [[Lake Mead]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Lavender | first = David | title = River Runners of the Grand Canyon | isbn = 978-0-8165-0940-9}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the Arizona Historical Foundation published the daily journal Goldwater had maintained on the Grand Canyon journey, including his photographs, in a 209-page volume titled ''Delightful Journey''.\n\nIn 1963, he joined the Arizona Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]]. He was also a lifetime member of the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], the [[American Legion]], and [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. He belonged to both the [[York Rite]] and [[Scottish Rite]] of Freemasonry, and was awarded the 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite.\n\n== Political career ==\nIn a heavily Democratic state, Goldwater became a conservative Republican and a friend of [[Herbert Hoover]]. He was outspoken against [[Modern liberalism in the United States|New Deal liberalism]], especially its close ties to labor unions he considered corrupt. A pilot, active amateur radio operator, outdoorsman and photographer, he criss-crossed Arizona and developed a deep interest in both the natural and the human history of the state.\n\nHe entered Phoenix politics in 1949, when he was elected to the City Council as part of a nonpartisan team of candidates pledged to clean up widespread prostitution and gambling. The team won every mayoral and council election for the next two decades. Goldwater rebuilt the weak Republican party and was instrumental in electing [[John Howard Pyle|Howard Pyle]] as [[Governor of Arizona|Governor]] in 1950.<ref>Robert Alan Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' (1995) pp. 67\u201398</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwaterchrono.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000914042048/http://washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwaterchrono.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 14, 2000 |work=The Washington Post |date=June 5, 1998 |accessdate=March 30, 2010 |title=A Look at the Life of Barry Goldwater |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== U.S. Senator ===\nAs a Republican he won a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in Arizona, 1952|1952]], when he upset veteran Democrat and Senate Majority Leader [[Ernest McFarland]].  He won largely by defeating McFarland in his native [[Maricopa County]] by 12,600 votes, almost double the overall margin of 6,725 votes. As a measure of how Democratic Arizona had been since joining the Union 40 years earlier, Goldwater was only the second Republican ever to represent Arizona in the Senate.

Goldwater's victory was all the more remarkable since it came in a year the Democrats gained 13 seats in the Senate. He gave up re-election for the Senate in 1964 in favor of his presidential campaign.\n\nDuring his Senate career, Goldwater was regarded as the \"Grand Old Man of the Republican Party and one of the nation's most respected exponents of conservatism.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Bart|title=Barry Goldwater, GOP Hero, Dies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater30.htm|accessdate=October 4, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=May 30, 1998}}</ref>\n\n=== Criticism of the Eisenhower administration ===\nGoldwater was outspoken about the Eisenhower administration, calling some of the policies of the Eisenhower administration too liberal for a Republican President. \"...Democrats delighted in pointing out that the junior senator was so headstrong that he had gone out his way to criticize the president of his own party.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Goldwater: the man who made a revolution |last=Edwards |first=Lee |publisher=Regnery Publishing |year=1995 |isbn=0895264714 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=89}}</ref> There was a Democratic majority in Congress for most of Eisenhower's career and Goldwater felt that [[Dwight D.

Goldwater alarmed even some of his fellow partisans with his brand of staunch [[Fiscal conservatives|fiscal conservatism]] and militant [[anti-communism]]. He was viewed by many traditional Republicans as being too far on the right wing of the political spectrum to appeal to the mainstream majority necessary to win a national election. As a result, moderate Republicans recruited a series of opponents, including [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Pennsylvania]] Governor [[William Scranton]], to challenge him. Goldwater would defeat Rockefeller in the winner-take-all California primary and secure the nomination. He also had a solid backing from Southern Republicans. A young [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] lawyer, [[John Grenier]], secured commitments from 271 of 279 southern convention delegates to back Goldwater. Grenier would serve as executive director of the national GOP during the Goldwater campaign, the number 2 position to party chairman [[Dean Burch]] of Arizona.\n\nJournalist John Adams says, \"his acceptance speech was bold, reflecting his conservative views, but not irrational.  Rather than shrinking from those critics who accuse him of extremism, Goldwater challenged them head-on\" in his acceptance speech at the 1964 Republican Convention.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adams, John |title=In the Trenches: Adventures in Journalism and Public Affairs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsALOP-k6-gC&pg=PA73|year=2012|pages=73\u2013|isbn=9781462067831}}</ref> In his own words:\n{{quote|I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.

Bush's son, [[George H. W. Bush]] (then running for the Senate from Texas against Democrat [[Ralph Yarborough]]), was also a strong Goldwater supporter in both the nomination and general election campaigns.\n\nFuture Chief Justice of the United States and fellow Arizonan [[William H.

Johnson himself did not mention Goldwater in his own acceptance speech at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]].\n\nGoldwater's provocative advocacy of aggressive tactics to prevent the spread of communism in Asia led to effective counterattacks from [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his supporters, who claimed that Goldwater's militancy would have dire consequences, possibly even nuclear war. In a May 1964 speech, Goldwater suggested that nuclear weapons should be treated more like conventional weapons and used in Vietnam, specifically that they should have been used at [[Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954 to defoliate trees.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nuclear Weapons and the Vietnam War |url=http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub/vietnam_weapons.pdf |last=Tannenwald |first=Nina |journal=The Journal of Strategic Studies |volume=29 |issue=4 |year=2006 |pages=675\u2013722 |doi=10.1080/01402390600766148 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LOJRPaoH?url=http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub/vietnam_weapons.pdf |archivedate=November 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |access-date=May 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Regarding Vietnam, Goldwater charged that Johnson's policy was devoid of \"goal, course, or purpose,\" leaving \"only sudden death in the jungles and the slow strangulation of freedom.\"<ref>Matthews 2002</ref> Goldwater's rhetoric on nuclear war was viewed by many as quite uncompromising, a view buttressed by off-hand comments such as, \"Let's lob one into the men's room at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]].\"<ref>{{cite journal |work=Harper's Magazine |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091012003831/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm|title=Tentacles of Rage: The Republican propaganda mill, a brief history|author=Lapham, Lewis H. |volume=309|issue=1852|date= September 2004 |archivedate=October 12, 2009}}</ref> He also advocated that field commanders in Vietnam and Europe should be given the authority to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s (which he called \"small conventional nuclear weapons\") without presidential confirmation.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=rUwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11-IA1&dq=goldwater+1964+%22small+conventional+nuclear+weapons%22)+intitle:life |title=Our Defense: a Crucial Issue for Candidates |work=Life |date=September 25, 1964 |page=11 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1964 Barry Goldwater bumper sticker.jpg|thumb|1964 Presidential campaign bumper sticker representing the Goldwater surname as Au = gold and H<sub>2</sub>O = water]]\n\nGoldwater countered the Johnson attacks by criticizing the administration for its perceived ethical lapses, and stating in a commercial that \"we, as a nation, are not far from the kind of moral decay that has brought on the fall of other nations and people....

''Fact'' had mailed questionnaires to 12,356 psychiatrists, receiving responses from 2,417, of whom 1,189 said Goldwater was mentally incapable of holding the office of president.

The campaign advertisement ended with a plea to vote for Johnson, implying that Goldwater (though not mentioned by name) would provoke a [[nuclear war]] if elected. The advertisement, which featured only a few spoken words and relied on imagery for its emotional impact, was one of the most provocative in American political campaign history, and many analysts credit it as being the birth of the modern style of \"[[negative campaigning|negative political ads]]\" on television.

In carrying Georgia by a margin of 54\u201345%, Goldwater became the first Republican nominee to win the state. However, the overall result was the worst showing in terms of popular vote and electoral college vote for any post-World War II Republican.  Indeed, he wouldn't have even carried his own state if not for a 20,000-vote margin in Maricopa County.\n\nIn all, Johnson won an overwhelming 486 electoral votes, to Goldwater's 52. Goldwater, with his customary bluntness, remarked, \"We would have lost even if [[Abraham Lincoln]] had come back and campaigned with us.\" He maintained later in life that he would have won the election if the country had not been in a state of extended grief following the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], and that it was simply not ready for a third president in just 14 months.\n\nGoldwater's poor showing pulled down many supporters. Of the 57 Republican Congressmen who endorsed Goldwater before the convention, 20 were defeated for reelection, along with many promising young Republicans. On the other hand, the defeat of so many older politicians created openings for young conservatives to move up the ladder.

He was subsequently reelected in 1974 and 1980. The [[United States Senate elections, 1974|1974]] election saw Goldwater easily reelected over his Democratic opponent, Jonathan Marshall, the publisher of ''The Scottsdale Progress''. His final campaign in 1980 was close, with Goldwater winning in a near draw against Democratic challenger Bill Schulz. Goldwater said later that the close result convinced him not to run again.<ref>{{Citation | url = //www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsuxC6Ft92I | title = YouTube | publisher = Google| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101104112917/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsuxC6Ft92I| archivedate = November 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Retirement ===\nGoldwater seriously considered retirement in [[United States Senate election in Arizona, 1980|1980]] before deciding to run for reelection. Peggy Goldwater reportedly hoped that her husband's Senate term, due to end in January 1981, would be his last. Goldwater decided to run, planning to make the term his last in the Senate. Goldwater faced a surprisingly tough battle for reelection. He was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons; most importantly, because he had planned to retire in 1981, Goldwater had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson. He was also challenged by a formidable opponent, Bill Schulz, a former Republican turned Democrat and a wealthy real estate developer. Schulz was able to infuse massive amounts of money into the campaign from his own fortune.\n\nArizona's changing population also hurt Goldwater. The state's population had soared, and a huge portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when Goldwater was previously elected; hence, many voters were less familiar with Goldwater's actual beliefs, and he was on the defensive for much of the campaign. Early returns on election night seemed to indicate that Schulz would win. The counting of votes continued through the night and into the next morning. At around daybreak, Goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to [[absentee ballot]]s, which were among the last to be counted.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | loc = chapter 12}} Goldwater's surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite Reagan's 61% landslide over [[Jimmy Carter]] in Arizona. Republicans regained control of the Senate, putting Goldwater in the most powerful position he ever had in the Senate.\n\nGoldwater retired in 1987, serving as chair of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees in his final term. Despite his reputation as a firebrand in the 1960s, by the end of his career he was considered a stabilizing influence in the Senate, one of the most respected members of either major party. Although Goldwater remained staunchly anti-communist and \"hawkish\" on military issues, he was a key supporter of the fight for ratification of the [[Panama Canal Treaty]] in the 1970s, which would give control of the canal zone to the Republic of [[Panama]]. His most important legislative achievement may have been the [[Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act]], which reorganized the U.S. military's senior-command structure.\n\n== Policies ==\nGoldwater became most associated with labor-union reform and anti-communism; he was a supporter of the [[conservative coalition]] in Congress. His work on labor issues led to Congress passing major anti-corruption reforms in 1957, and an all-out campaign by the [[AFL-CIO]] to defeat his 1958 reelection bid. He voted against the censure of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, but he never actually charged any individual with being a communist/Soviet agent. Goldwater emphasized his strong opposition to the worldwide spread of communism in his 1960 book ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]''. The book became an important reference text in conservative political circles.\n\n[[File:Informal press conference following a meeting between Congressmen and the President to discuss Watergate matters. - NARA - 194590.jpg|thumb|Informal press conference August 7, 1974 (one day before Nixon announced his resignation) following a meeting between Goldwater, [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Hugh Scott|Scott]], [[House Minority Leader]] [[John Jacob Rhodes|Rhodes]] and the President to discuss the [[Watergate scandal]] and [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment process]]]]\n\nIn 1964, Goldwater ran a conservative campaign that emphasized states' rights.{{Sfn | Donaldson | 2003 | p = 20}}  Goldwater's 1964 campaign was a magnet for conservatives since he opposed interference by the federal government in state affairs. Although he had supported all previous federal civil rights legislation including the 1957 Civil Rights Act H.R. 6127 and the 1960 Civil Rights Act H.R. 8601{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and had supported the original Senate version of the bill, Goldwater made the decision to oppose the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. His stance was based on his view that Article II and Article VII of the Act interfered with the rights of private persons to do or not to do business with whomever they chose, and believed that the private employment provisions of the Act would lead to racial quotas.{{Sfn | Donaldson | 2003 | pp = 152\u201379}} In the segregated city of Phoenix in the 1950s, he had quietly supported civil rights for blacks, but would not let his name be used.<ref>Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' (1995) pp. 88\u201390</ref>\n\nAll this [[Southern strategy|appealed to white Southern Democrats]], and Goldwater was the first Republican to win the electoral votes of all of the Deep South states ([[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]) since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]<ref name=\"Bernard Cosman 1966\">{{Citation | first = Bernard | last = Cosman | title = Five States for Goldwater: Continuity and change in Southern presidential voting patterns | year = 1966}}</ref> (although Dwight Eisenhower did carry Louisiana in 1956). However, Goldwater's vote on the Civil Rights Act proved devastating to his campaign everywhere outside the South (besides Dixie, Goldwater won only in Arizona, his home state), contributing to his landslide defeat in 1964.\n\nWhile Goldwater had been depicted by his opponents in the Republican primaries as a representative of a [[conservatism|conservative philosophy]] that was extreme and alien, his voting records show that his positions were in harmony with those of his fellow Republicans in the Congress. What distinguished him from his predecessors was, according to [[Hans J. Morgenthau]], his firmness of principle and determination, which did not allow him to be content with mere rhetoric.<ref>{{Citation | first = Hans J | last = Morgenthau | title = Goldwater \u2013 The Romantic Regression | newspaper = Commentary |date=September 1964}}</ref>\n\nGoldwater fought in 1971 to stop U.S. funding of the United Nations after the People's Republic of China was admitted to the organization. He said:\n{{quote | I suggested on the floor of the Senate today that we stop all funds for the United Nations. Now, what that'll do to the United Nations, I don't know.

He explained his position in 1969:\n{{Quote|I feel very definitely that the [Nixon] administration is absolutely correct in cracking down on companies and corporations and municipalities that continue to pollute the nation's air and water. While I am a great believer in the free competitive enterprise system and all that it entails, I am an even stronger believer in the right of our people to live in a clean and pollution-free environment.

Beginning in 1969 up to his death he appeared in numerous educational and promotional films (and later videos) about the hobby that were produced for the [[American Radio Relay League]] (the United States national society representing the interests of radio amateurs) by such producers as Dave Bell (W6AQ), ARRL Southwest Director John R. Griggs (W6KW), Alan Kaul (W6RCL), Forrest Oden (N6ENV), and the late Roy Neal (K6DUE). His first appearance was in Dave Bell's ''The World of Amateur Radio'' where Goldwater discussed the history of the hobby and demonstrated a live contact with Antarctica. His last on-screen appearance dealing with \"ham radio\" was in 1994, explaining a then-upcoming, Earth-orbiting ham radio relay satellite.\n\nElectronics was a hobby for Goldwater beyond amateur radio. He enjoyed assembling [[Heathkit]]s,<ref name=\"shea19820913\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDAEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA25&pg=PA26 | title=Buckley finds word processing on Z-89 'liberating' | work=InfoWorld | date=September 13, 1982 | accessdate=January 9, 2015 | author=Shea, Tom | pages=26}}</ref> completing more than 100 and often visiting their maker in [[Benton Harbor, Michigan]], to buy more, before the company exited the kit business in 1992.<ref name=\"fisher\">Fisher, Lawrence M. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/30/business/plug-is-pulled-on-heathkits-ending-a-do-it-yourself-era.html Plug Is Pulled on Heathkits, Ending a Do-It-Yourself Era]\" ''The New York Times'', March 30, 1992.</ref>\n\n=== Kachina dolls ===\n[[File:Kachina Dolls Heard Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Over half of the kachina dolls at the Heard Museum were donated by Goldwater.]]\nIn 1916, Goldwater visited the [[Hopi]] [[Indian Reservation|Reservation]] with Phoenix architect John Rinker Kibby, and obtained his first [[Hopi Kachina figure|kachina doll]].

He was very keen on [[candid photography]]. He got started in photography after receiving a camera as a gift from his wife on their first Christmas together. He was known to use a [[Large format|4\u00d75]] [[Graflex]], [[Rolleiflex]], 16&nbsp;mm Bell and Howell motion picture camera, and [[135 film|35 mm]] [[Nikkormat#Nikkormat FT|Nikkormat FT]].

Three books with his photographs are ''People and Places'', from 1967; ''Barry Goldwater and the Southwest'', from 1976; and ''Delightful Journey'', first published in 1940 and reprinted in 1970. [[Ansel Adams]] wrote a foreword to the 1976 book.<ref>''Arizona Republic'', May 31, 1998</ref>\n\nGoldwater's photography interests occasionally crossed over with his political career. [[John F. Kennedy]], as president, was known to invite former congressional colleagues to the White House for a drink. On one occasion, Goldwater brought his camera and photographed President Kennedy. When Kennedy received the photo, he returned it to Goldwater, with the inscription, \"For Barry Goldwater\u2014Whom I urge to follow the career for which he has shown such talent\u2014photography!\u2014from his friend \u2013 John Kennedy.\" This quip became a classic of American political humor after it was made famous by humorist [[Bennett Cerf]]. The photo itself was prized by Goldwater for the rest of his life, and recently sold for $17,925 in a [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6047&Lot_No=47197 |title=Heritage Auctions description of signed Kennedy photo |publisher=Historical.ha.com |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221045509/http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6047&Lot_No=47197 |archivedate=February 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSon Michael Prescott Goldwater formed the Goldwater Family Foundation with the goal of making his father's photography available via the internet.

About ten or twelve years ago I made an effort to find out what was in the building at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] where the information has been stored that has been collected by the Air Force, and I was understandably denied this request. It is still classified above Top Secret.\"<ref name=\"anomalies.net\" /> Goldwater further wrote that there were rumors the evidence would be released, and that he was \"just as anxious to see this material as you are, and I hope we will not have to wait much longer.\"<ref name=\"anomalies.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.anomalies.net/archive/Text-Archive/txt1/469.ufo |title=FOIA documents | publisher = Anomalies |accessdate=March 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307074012/http://www.anomalies.net/archive/Text-Archive/txt1/469.ufo |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe April 25, 1988, issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' carried an interview where Goldwater said he repeatedly asked his friend, General [[Curtis LeMay]], if there was any truth to the rumors that UFO evidence was stored in a secret room at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], and if he (Goldwater) might have access to the room.

About a dozen of the crewmen managed to escape from the sinking submarine, and Lieutenant [[Godfrey Herbert]], commanding officer of ''Baralong'', ordered the surviving sailors to be [[summary execution|summarily executed]] after they boarded the ''Nicosian''. All the survivors of ''U-27''{{'}}s sinking, including several who had reached the ''Nicosian'', were shot by ''Baralong''{{'}}s crew. Later, ''Baralong'' sank {{SMU|U-41|Germany|2}} in an incident which has also been described as a [[war crime]].<ref>Coles (1986) p. {{Page needed|date=May 2011}}</ref><ref>Bridgland (1999) pp. 20-55</ref>\n\n==First incident==\n\n===Action of 19 August 1915===\nAfter the sinking of {{RMS|Lusitania}} by a German submarine in May 1915, [[Lieutenant-Commander]] [[Godfrey Herbert]], commanding officer of ''Baralong'', was visited by two officers of the [[Admiralty]]'s Secret Service branch at the naval base at [[Cobh|Queenstown, Ireland]]. He was told, \"This ''Lusitania'' business is shocking. Unofficially, we are telling you... take no prisoners from U-boats.\"<ref>Bridgland (1999) p. 21</ref>\n\nInterviews with his subordinate officers have established Herbert's undisciplined manner of commanding his ship. Herbert allowed his men to engage in [[binge drinking|drunken binges]] during [[shore leave]]. During one such incident, at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], several members of ''Baralong''{{'}}s crew were arrested after destroying a local saloon. Herbert paid their bail, then left port with the indicted crewmen aboard. Beginning in April 1915, Herbert ordered his subordinates to cease calling him \"Sir\", and to address him only by the [[pseudonym]] \"Captain William McBride\".<ref>Messimer (2002) p. 23</ref>\n\nThroughout the summer of 1915, ''Baralong'' continued routine patrol duties in the Irish Sea without encountering the enemy.\n\nOn 19 August 1915, {{SMU|U-24||2}} sank the [[White Star Line]]r {{SS|Arabic|1902|6}} with the loss of 44 lives \u2013 this included three Americans and led to a diplomatic incident between Germany and the United States. HMS ''Baralong'' had been about {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on}} from the scene, and had received a distress call from the ship.<ref name=oneill9/> ''Baralong''{{'}}s crew was infuriated by the attack and by their inability to locate survivors.<ref name=messimer4647/>\n\nMeanwhile, about {{convert|70|nmi|lk=on}} south of Queenstown, {{SMU|U-27|Germany|2}}, commanded by ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' Bernd Wegener, stopped the British steamer ''Nicosian'' in accordance with the rules laid down by the [[London Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War|London Declaration]]. A boarding party of six men from ''U-27'' discovered that ''Nicosian'' was carrying munitions and 250 American mules earmarked for the [[British Army]] in France. The Germans allowed the freighter's crew and passengers to board lifeboats, and prepared to sink the freighter with the U-boat's [[deck gun]].\n\n''U-27'' was lying off ''Nicosian''{{'}}s port quarter and firing into it when ''Baralong'' appeared on the scene, flying the ensign of the United States as a [[false flag]]. When she was half a mile away, ''Baralong'' ran up a signal flag indicating that she was going to rescue ''Nicosian''{{'}}s crew. Wegener acknowledged the signal, then ordered his men to cease firing, and took ''U-27'' along the port side of ''Nicosian'' to intercept ''Baralong''. As the submarine disappeared behind the steamship, Herbert steered ''Baralong'' on a parallel course along ''Nicosian''{{'}}s starboard side.<ref name=messimer4647>Messimer (2002) pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Baralong vs SM U-27.jpg|thumb|The action of 19 August 1915]]\n\nBefore ''U-27'' came round ''Nicosian''{{'}}s bow, ''Baralong'' hauled down the American flag, hoisted the Royal Navy's [[White Ensign]], and unmasked her guns. As ''U-27'' came into view from behind ''Nicosian'', ''Baralong'' opened fire with her three [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder guns]] at a range of {{convert|600|yd|abbr=on}}, firing 34 rounds for only a single shot from the submarine. ''U-27'' rolled over and began to sink.<ref name=oneill9>O'Neill (2006) p. 9</ref><ref name=messimer4647/>\n\nAccording to Tony Bridgland; <blockquote>Herbert screamed, \"Cease fire!\" But his men's blood was up. They were avenging the ''Arabic'' and the ''Lusitania''. For them this was no time to cease firing, even as the survivors of the crew appeared on the outer casing, struggling out of their clothes to swim away from her. There was a mighty hiss of compressed air from her tanks and the ''U-27'' vanished from sight in a vortex of giant rumbling bubbles, leaving a pall of smoke over the spot where she had been. It had taken only a few minutes to fire the thirty-four shells into her.<ref>Messimer (2002) pp. 29\u201330</ref></blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, ''Nicosian''{{'}}s crew were cheering wildly from the lifeboats. Captain Manning was heard to yell, \"If any of those bastard [[List of terms used for Germans#Hun|Huns]] come up, lads, hit 'em with an oar!\"<ref>Messimer (2002) p. 30</ref>\n\nTwelve men survived the sinking of the submarine: the crews of her two deck guns and those who had been on the conning tower. They swam to ''Nicosian'' and attempted to join the six-man boarding party by climbing up her hanging lifeboat falls<ref group=\"note\">The ropes by which a boat is lowered from the deck of a ship to the water</ref> and pilot ladder. Herbert, worried that they might try to scuttle the steamer, ordered his men to open fire with small arms, killing all in the water.<ref name=oneill9/><ref name=GibPren53>Gibson & Prendergast, p. 53</ref><ref name=grant>Grant (2002) p. 27</ref><ref name=halpern>Halpern (1994) p. 301</ref> Wegener is described by some accounts as being shot while trying to swim to the ''Baralong''.<ref name=grant/>\n\nHerbert sent ''Baralong''{{'}}s 12 [[Royal Marines]], under the command of a Corporal Collins, to find the surviving German sailors aboard ''Nicosian''. As they departed, Herbert told Collins, \"Take no prisoners.\"<ref>Messimer (2002) p. 42</ref> The Germans were discovered in the engine room and shot on sight. According to Sub-Lieutenant [[Gordon Charles Steele|Gordon Steele]]: \"Wegener ran to a cabin on the upper deck \u2013 I later found out it was Manning's bathroom. The marines broke down the door with the butts of their rifles, but Wegener squeezes through a scuttle and dropped into the sea. He still had his life-jacket on and put up his arms in surrender. Corporal Collins, however, took aim and shot him through the head.\"<ref name=\"Bridgland43\">Bridgland (1999) p. 43</ref> Corporal Collins later recalled that, after Wegener's death, Herbert threw a revolver in the German captain's face and screamed, \"What about the ''Lusitania'', you bastard!\"<ref name=\"Bridgland43\"/> An alternative account says that the Germans who boarded ''Nicosian'' were killed by the freighter's engine room staff; this report apparently came from the officer in command of the muleteers.<ref name=oneill9/><ref>McGill & Norris (2007) pp. 320\u2013321</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn Herbert's report to the Admiralty, he stated he feared the survivors from the U-boat's crew would [[Boarding (attack)|board]] the freighter and scuttle her, so he ordered the [[Royal Marines]] on his ship to shoot the survivors. If they had scuttled the freighter, it could have been counted as negligence on the part of Herbert. Moments before ''Baralong'' began her attack, the submarine was firing on the freighter. It is not known if the escaping sailors actually intended to scuttle the freighter.\n\nThe Admiralty, upon receiving Herbert's report, immediately ordered its suppression, but the strict [[censorship]] imposed on the event failed when Americans who had witnessed the incident from ''Nicosian''{{'}}s lifeboats spoke to newspaper reporters after their return to the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Halpern|title=A Naval History of World War I|page=301|accessdate=18 February 2015|quote=when some American muleteers who had been accompanying the mules returned to port, they spread stories of a massacre}}</ref>\n\n===German memorandum===\nThe German government delivered a memorandum on the incident via the American ambassador in Berlin, who received it on 6 December 1915. In it, they cited six US citizens as witnesses, stating they had made sworn [[deposition (law)|depositions]] regarding the incident before [[notary public|public notaries]] in the US.\n\nThe statements said that five survivors from ''U-27'' managed to board ''Nicosian'', while the rest were shot and killed on Herbert's orders while clinging to the merchant vessel's lifeboat falls. It was further stated that when Herbert ordered his Marines to board ''Nicosian'', he gave the order \"take no prisoners\". Four German sailors were found in ''Nicosian''{{'}}s engine room and propeller shaft tunnel, and were killed. According to the witness statements, ''U-27''{{'}}s commander was shot while swimming towards ''Baralong''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Memorandum of the German Government... and reply of His Majesty's Government thereto|work= |publisher=WWW Virtual Library |date= |url=http://www.vlib.us/wwi/resources/archives/texts/t050925/Baralong.html |accessdate=8 December 2012}}[note: the British reply is not included]</ref>\n\nThe memorandum demanded that the captain and crew of ''Baralong'' be tried for the murder of unarmed German sailors, threatening to \"take the serious decision of retribution for an unpunished crime\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Baralong Case|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15635604|accessdate=28 July 2013|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=6 January 1916|page=7}}</ref> [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] replied through the American ambassador that the incident could be grouped together with the Germans' sinking of SS ''Arabic'', their attack on a stranded British submarine on the neutral Dutch coast, and their attack on the steamship ''Ruel'', and suggested that they be placed before a tribunal composed of US Navy officers.<ref name=reg>Hesperides (2007) pp. 58\u201359</ref>\n\n===German reaction===\nA debate took place in the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] on 15 January 1916, where the incident was described as a \"cowardly murder\" and Grey's note as being \"full of insolence and arrogance\".{{citequote|date=January 2016}} It was announced that reprisals had been decided, but not what form they would take.<ref name=reg/>\n\nMeanwhile, the Military Bureau for the Investigation of Violations of the Laws of War ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4runtersuchungstelle f\u00fcr Verletzungen des Kriegsrechts}}) added ''Baralong'''s commander, whose name was known only as \"Captain William McBride\", to the Prussian Ministry of War's \"Black List of Englishmen who are Guilty of Violations of the Laws of War vis a vis Members of the German Armed Forces\".<ref>Alfred M. de Zayas, ''The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau 1939\u20131945'', page 8.</ref>\n\n''HMS Baralong''{{'}}s actions led the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' to cease adhering to the [[Prize Rules]] and to practise [[unrestricted submarine warfare]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} During the Second World War, it was cited{{by whom|date=January 2016}} as a reason for the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' to do the same.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} A German medal was issued commemorating the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.nmm.ac.uk/collections/objects/39815.html |title=Medal commemorating the sinking of 'U.27' by Q-ship 'Baralong', 1915 |work=The Collection |publisher=National Maritime Museum |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs a precaution to protect the ships against any reprisals against their crews, HMS ''Wyandra''{{clarify|Renamed when|date=December 2011}} was transferred to the Mediterranean, and took the name of sister ship ''Manica'', while ''Baralong''{{'}}s name was deleted from ''[[Lloyd's Register]]''.

Wilmot-Smith, was later awarded \u00a3170 prize bounty.<ref name=chatterton/>\n\n''U-41'' was in the process of sinking SS ''Urbino'' with gunfire when ''Baralong'' arrived on the scene, flying an American flag. When ''U-41'' surfaced near ''Baralong'', the latter opened fire while continuing to fly the American flag, and sank the U-boat.\n\n===Aftermath of the second incident===\nUnlike the neutral Americans in the first incident, the only witnesses to the second attack were the German and British sailors present. ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' Iwan Crompton, after returning to Germany from a prisoner-of-war camp, reported that ''Baralong'' had run down the lifeboat he was in; he leapt clear and was shortly after taken aboard ''Baralong''. The British crew denied that they had run down the lifeboat.<ref>Messimer, pp. 61-62</ref> Crompton later published an account of ''U-41''{{'}}s exploits in 1917, ''U-41: der zweite Baralong-Fall'', which called the sinking of ''U-41'' a \"second Baralong case\".<ref>Hadley (1995) p. 36</ref>\n\nThe event was also commemorated in a propaganda medal designed by the German engraver [[Karl Goetz]]. This was one of many medals that were popular in Germany from around 1910 to 1940.<ref>{{cite web|title=The sinking of 'U.41' by Q-ship 'Baralong', 1915|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/39816.html|website=Royal Museums, Greenwich|publisher=National Maritime Museum|accessdate=20 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unrestricted submarine warfare]]\n* [[Merchant raiders]]\n* [[Commerce raiding]]\n* [[Tonnage war]]\n\n==Notes==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bridgland |first=Tony |title=Sea Killers in Disguise: Q Ships and Decoy Raiders |publisher=Leo Cooper |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-85052-675-2 |chapter=The ''Baralong'': Germany is Outraged}}\n* {{cite book |last=Chatterton |first=E.

After the successful airing of a [[test pilot movie]] on February 22, 1993, ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering]]'', in May 1993 Warner Bros. commissioned the series for production as part of its [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]] (PTEN).<ref>{{cite web |title=Prime Time Entertainment Network announces expansion plans and programming slate for January 1994|author=Cynthia Lieberman|date=May 27, 1993 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PRIME+TIME+ENTERTAINMENT+NETWORK+ANNOUNCES+EXPANSION+PLANS+AND...-a013164529|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|accessdate=2011-12-16}}</ref>\n\nThe first season premiered in the US on January 26, 1994, and the series ultimately ran for the intended five seasons.

Major plotlines include ''Babylon 5'''s involvement in a millennia-old war between powerful, ancient alien races, and its resistance against the rise of a totalitarian government on Earth.\n\n==Setting==\n''Babylon 5'', set between the years 2257 and 2262, depicts a future where Earth has a unifying [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)#Early development|Earth government]] and has gained the technology for [[faster-than-light]] travel. Colonies within the solar system, and beyond, make up the [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]], and contact has been made with other [[Spacefaring#Spacefaring in popular culture|spacefaring]] species. Ten years earlier, Earth itself was nearly defeated in a war with the intellectual [[Minbari]], only to escape destruction when the Minbari unexpectedly surrendered at the brink of victory; since then, Earth has established peaceful relationships with them. Among the other species are the imperialist [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]]; the [[Narn]], who only recently gained independence from the Centauri empire; and the mysterious [[Vorlon]]s. Several dozen less powerful species from the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] also have diplomatic contact with the major races, including the [[Drazi]], [[Brakiri]], [[Vree]], [[Civilizations in Babylon 5#Markab|Markab]], and [[pak'ma'ra]]. An ancient and secretive race, the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]], unknown to humans but documented in many other races' religious texts, malevolently influence events to bring chaos and war among the known species.\n\nThe [[Babylon 5 (fictional space station)|''Babylon 5'' space station]] is located in the [[Epsilon Eridani]] system, at the [[Trojan (celestial body)|fifth Lagrangian point]] between the fictional planet [[Epsilon III]] and its moon.<ref>{{cite web |title=Babylon 5 Universe: The Station|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/universe/station-1.html|accessdate=2009-07-28|author=Straczynski, J.

Michael|date=November 16, 1994 |newsgroup=rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated |url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-14880 |accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes}}\n{{:List of Babylon 5 episodes}}\nThe five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258\u20132262. Each season shares its name with an episode that is central to that season's plot. As the series starts, the ''Babylon 5'' station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the much more powerful [[Minbari]], who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race during the [[Battle of the Line]].\n\n=== Season 1 \u2013 Year 2258 ===\n{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 1: Signs and Portents (1994)}}\nDuring 2258, [[Jeffrey Sinclair|Commander Jeffrey Sinclair]] is in charge of the station, assisted by executive officer [[Susan Ivanova]] and security chief [[Michael Garibaldi]]. Much of the story revolves around his gradual discovery that it was his capture by the Minbari at the Battle of the Line which ended the war against Earth. Upon capturing Sinclair, the Minbari came to believe that he was the reincarnation of [[List of Babylon 5 characters#V|Valen]], a great Minbari leader and hero of the last Minbari-Shadow war. Inferring that others of their species had been and were continuing to be reborn as humans, and in obedience to the edict that Minbari do not kill one another lest they harm the soul, they stopped the war just as [[Earth (Babylon 5)|Earth's]] final defenses were on the verge of collapse.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions between the Centauri Republic, an empire in decline, and the Narn Regime, a former dominion which rebelled and gained freedom from the Centauri, are increasing. Ambassador G'Kar of the Narn wishes for his people to strike back at the Centauri for what they did to his people, and Ambassador Londo Mollari of the Centauri wishes for his people to become again the great empire they once were. As part of these struggles, Mollari makes a deal with a mysterious ally, Mr. Morden, to strike back at the Narn, further heightening tensions. Further, a significant number of humans on Earth resent humanity's interactions with aliens, seeking to eliminate aliens on any Earth-owned property by any means possible, including those on ''Babylon 5''.\n\nIt is gradually revealed that [[Delenn|Ambassador Delenn]] is a member of the mysterious and powerful [[Grey Council]], the ruling body of the Minbari. Towards the end of 2258, she begins a transformation into a Minbari/human hybrid, ostensibly to build a bridge between the humans and Minbari. The year ends with the death of [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] president Luis Santiago. The death is officially ruled an accident, but some members of the military, including the staff of ''Babylon 5'', believe it to be an assassination.\n\n=== Season 2 \u2013 Year 2259 ===\n{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 2: The Coming of Shadows (1994\u20131995)}}\nAt the beginning of 2259, [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|Captain John Sheridan]] replaces Sinclair as the military governor of the station after Sinclair is reassigned as ambassador to Minbar. He and the command staff gradually learn that the assassination of President Santiago was arranged by his then\u2013Vice President, Morgan Clark, who has now become president. Conflict develops between the ''Babylon 5'' command staff and the [[Psi Corps]], an increasingly [[autocratic]] organization which oversees and controls the lives of human [[telepathy|telepaths]].\n\nThe Centauri homeworld prepares for the pending death of their current emperor, whose health has been failing. To assure their ascent into power, Ambassador Mollari works with Lord Refa to assassinate any challengers to the throne, while continuing to request services of the mysteries \"Shadows\" through their agent Mr. Morden to instigate conflict with the Narn. When the emperor dies, Mollari and Refa place the emperor's unstable nephew on the throne, through whom they conspire to start a full-scale war with the Narn, including the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] against the Narn homeworld to conquer it. Earth's government, prompted by the new war, becomes more totalitarian. Kosh and other Vorlons approach Sheridan and reveal themselves to be the enemies of the Shadows, and fearing that the Shadows have been behind many of these events, ask Sheridan for his help to fight them.\n\n=== Season 3 \u2013 Year 2260 ===\n{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 3: Point of No Return (1995\u20131996)}}\nEarth's government continues to become more [[xenophobia|xenophobic]], while on ''Babylon 5'', Sheridan and Delenn, who have become romantically involved, create a \"conspiracy of light\" to try to reveal the truth behind the Shadows' influence. When the Mars colony is bombed, Earth's government declares martial law, but Sheridan refuses to go along, and declares ''Babylon 5''{{'}}s independence from Earth. When Earth forces attempt to retake the station, Minbari forces help to fight them off.\n\nThe fate of ''Babylon 4'' is discovered when Sinclair returns to the station to request Sheridan's help: Sinclair had been destined to use time travel to take ''Babylon 4'' back in time to the previous Minbari-Shadow war, where he is transformed into the revered Minbari leader, Valen. During this, Sheridan briefly sees a vision of the downfall of the Centauri homeworld at the hands of the Shadows, and vows to prevent this future.\n\nAmbassador Mollari comes to realize his deal with the Shadows has become dangerous and attempts to sever ties with Mr. Morden; but this only serves to ingrain the Shadows within the Centauri homeworld further. Kosh informs Sheridan that the Shadows can be fought against with telepaths, but the Shadows later kill Kosh for revealing this information. Sheridan leads forces to attack Shadow vessels with Kosh's information. Sheridan's wife, thought dead on an archaeological dig on the planet Z'ha'dum years earlier, arrives at the station and tells Sheridan to come to Z'ha'dum. Knowing it is likely a Shadow trap, Sheridan travels there alone. Guided by Kosh's words, Sheridan flies a vessel loaded with explosives into the planet while jumping into a pit into the depths of the planet. Meanwhile, ''Babylon 5'' is facing attack by Shadow vessels, but the Shadows abandon their assault when Sheridan bombs Z'ha'dum.  Delenn senses the explosions and fears Sheridan is dead. Garibaldi, who was fighting in the battle, does not return to the station when the Shadows retreat.\n\n=== Season 4 \u2013 Year 2261 ===\n{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 4: No Surrender, No Retreat (1996\u20131997)}}\nSheridan returns from Z'ha'dum with the help of a strange being known as Lorien, who has given Sheridan exactly 20 more years to live as to complete his role in the galaxy. The Vorlons join in the war against the Shadows, but the other races become concerned when they find the Vorlons willing to destroy any planet that has been even tainted by Shadow influence. Sheridan learns that the Vorlons and Shadows had been tasked by the First Ones to care for the younger races in the galaxy, but due to differences of opinion, have been at war for eons, using the younger races to serve in a [[proxy war]]. With the help of the First Ones, Sheridan convinces the Vorlons and Shadows to move on from this galaxy, allowing the younger races to find their own way.\n\nGaribaldi returns to ''Babylon 5'' but without any explanation for his disappearance. The station staff recognize he is not the same as before he disappeared, and has been working with Mars tycoon William Edgars for unknown reasons, including kidnapping Sheridan. Later, it is discovered that Garibaldi was brainwashed by Bester of the Psi-Corps to seek out information about Edgars and reveal it back to Bester at the right time, this being about a virus developed by Edgars to destroy telepaths. Edgars is killed, and Bester releases Garibaldi of his brainwashing.\n\nWith the Vorlons and Shadows gone, Earth's totalitarian government attempts to use the captured Sheridan to use as a propaganda tool, but Garibaldi rescues him. A brief war breaks out on Earth, culminating in President Clark's suicide and allowing Earth's government to return to a more democratic state. However, Ivanova is critically injured in the war, and decides to leave Earthforce. Alongside this, the League of Non-Aligned Worlds are reorganized into a [[Interstellar Alliance (Babylon 5)|Interstellar Alliance]] with Earth, Minbari, Narm, and Centauri, acting as a United Nations across the galaxy, with the [[Anla'shok|Rangers]] as their enforcers. Sheridan is made president of the Alliance, and he and Delenn get married.\n\n=== Season 5 \u2013 Year 2262 and beyond ===\n{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 5: The Wheel of Fire (1998)}}\nIn 2262, Earthforce Captain [[Elizabeth Lochley]] is appointed to command ''Babylon 5'', which is now also the headquarters of the Interstellar Alliance. The station grows in its role as a sanctuary for rogue telepaths running from the [[Psi Corps]]. Sheridan and Delenn move to Minbari and raise a family, and Garibaldi also marries and settles down on Mars. G'kar becomes a religious icon for the Narn and goes on his own exploration of space.\n\nA species known as the Drakh, who had been loyal to the Shadows, influence events on Centauri Prime to cause the rest of the Alliance to go to war against the Centauri, leaving much of the planet in ruin. Mollari is forced by the Drakh to become the Centauri Emperor, coerced by the use of a Drakh parasite called a Keeper which can read and control one's thoughts, while Vir Cotto takes over as ambassador to the Alliance. Over the next several years, Mollari is forced to endure the Drakh's control, but when they kidnap Sheridan and Delenn, Mollari attempts to intercede, calling on G'Kar to kill him as to distract his Keeper to allow Sheridan and Delenn to escape. However, the Keeper senses the attack, and forces Mollari to kill G'Kar as well, fulfilling the prophecy that Mollari has seen years prior with the two dying at each other's throats. Cotto becomes Emperor in Mollari's place, expelling the Drakh and promising to restore the Centauri relationships with the Alliance.\n\nTwenty years after his return from Z'ha'dum, Sheridan feels his life fading. He has the Rangers contact all his old friends, who come for Minbari for a farewell party. The next day, Sheridan attempts to leave before Delenn finds out, but she stops him before he can depart. She knows he will soon die, and gives him her final goodbyes, and tells him it is a good day for a \"Sunday drive\". Alone, Sheridan revisits ''Babylon 5'' which is in the process of decommissioning, as the Alliance has found better locations and routes to serve its purpose; it is demolished some time later. Sheridan continues on to the area of space where the final Vorlon/Shadow encounter took place, and on the verge of his final breaths, is met by the First Ones, who offer Sheridan to come with them and travel beyond the rim of the galaxy with them. Sheridan's ship is found adrift and empty some days later.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Origin ===\nHaving worked on a number of television science fiction shows which had regularly gone over budget, creator J. Michael Straczynski concluded that a lack of long-term planning was to blame, and set about looking at ways in which a series could be done responsibly. Taking note of the lessons of mainstream television, which brought stories to a centralized location such as a hospital, police station, or law office, he decided that instead of \"[going] in search of new worlds, building them anew each week\", a fixed space station setting would keep costs at a reasonable level. A fan of sagas such as the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], ''[[Childhood's End]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' and the [[Lensman series|''Lensman'' series]], Straczynski wondered why no one had done a television series with the same epic sweep, and concurrently with the first idea started developing the concept for a vastly ambitious epic covering massive battles and other universe-changing events. Realizing that both the fixed-locale series and the epic could be done in a single series, he began to sketch the initial outline of what would become ''Babylon 5''.<ref name=\"GEnie-1992\">{{cite web<!-- Archive URL date taken from page metadata, main URL date taken is the one used for the entire document -->|url=http://www.midwinter.com/b5/GEnie/jms92-04|title=Babylon 5 (GEnie) posts by JMS for April, 1992|last=Straczynski|first=J.

Unable to get word one way or the other from parent company [[Warner Bros.]], and unwilling to short-change the story and the fans, Straczynski began preparing modifications to the fourth season in order to allow for both eventualities. Straczynski identified three primary [[narrative thread]]s which would require resolution: the Shadow war, Earth's slide into a dictatorship, and a series of sub-threads which branched off from those. Estimating they would still take around 27 episodes to resolve without having the season feel rushed, the solution came when the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] network commissioned two ''Babylon 5'' television films. Several hours of material was thus able to be moved into the films, including a three-episode arc which would deal with the background to the [[Earth\u2013Minbari War]], and a sub-thread which would have set up the sequel series, ''Crusade''. Further standalone episodes and plot-threads were dropped from season four, which could be inserted into ''Crusade'', or the fifth season, were it to be given the [[greenlight]].<ref name=\"writing\"/> The intended series finale, \"[[Sleeping in Light]]\", was filmed during season four as a precaution against cancellation. When word came that TNT had picked up ''Babylon 5'', this was moved to the end of season five and replaced with a newly filmed season four finale, \"[[The Deconstruction of Falling Stars]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=How will this play out |author=Straczynski, J.

Michael Straczynski to get a sense of the historical perspective of the major alien races, \"so I knew if they were a peaceful people or a warring people, cold climate etc. and then I would interpret what kind of sensibility that called for.\"<ref name=\"Bruice1\"/> Collaborating with other departments to establish co-ordinated visual themes for each race, a broad palette of colors was developed with Iacovelli, which he referred to as \"spicy brights\".<ref name=\"Iacovelli1\"/> These warm shades of grey and secondary colors, such as certain blues for the [[Minbari]], would often be included when designing both the costumes and relevant sets. As the main characters evolved, Bruice referred back to Straczynski and producer John Copeland who she viewed as \"surprisingly more accessible to me as advisors than other producers and directors\", so the costumes could reflect these changes. Ambassador [[Londo Mollari]]'s purple coat became dark blue and more tailored while his waistcoats became less patterned and brightly colored as Bruice felt \"Londo has evolved in my mind from a buffoonish character to one who has become more serious and darker.\"<ref name=\"Bruice2\"/>\n\nNormally there were three changes of costume for the primary actors; one for on set, one for the stunt double and one on standby in case of \"coffee spills\". For human civilians, garments were generally purchased [[Ready-to-wear|off-the-rack]] and altered in various ways, such as removing lapels from jackets and shirts while rearranging [[Hook-and-eye closure|closures]], to suggest future fashions. For some of the main female characters a more [[Haute couture|couture]] approach was taken, as in the suits worn by [[Talia Winters]] which Bruice described as being designed and fitted to within \"an inch of their life\". Costumes for the destitute residents of downbelow would be distressed through a combination of bleaching, sanding, dipping in dye baths and having stage blood added.<ref name=\"Bruice1\"/>\n\nLike many of the crew on the show, members of the costume department made onscreen [[Cameo appearance|cameos]]. During the season 4 episode \"[[Atonement (Babylon 5)|Atonement]]\", the tailors and costume supervisor appeared as the Minbari women fitting [[Zack Allan]] for his new uniform as the recently promoted head of security. His complaints, and the subsequent stabbing of him with a needle by costume supervisor Kim Holly, was a light-hearted reference to the previous security uniforms, a design carried over from the pilot movie which were difficult to work with and wear due to the combination of leather and wool.<ref name=\"Kim1\"/>\n\n=== Prosthetic makeup and animatronics ===\nWhile the original pilot film featured some [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] which were puppets and [[animatronics]], the decision was made early on in the show's production to portray most alien species as [[humanoid]] in appearance. Barring isolated appearances, fully [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] aliens were discounted as an idea due to the \"massive [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] power\"<ref name=\"JMSemotion\" /> required. Long-term use of puppets and animatronics was also discounted due to the technological limitations in providing convincing interaction with the human actors (\"...if you want any real ''emotion'' from the character, you're going {{notatypo|to have to have}} an actor inside\").<ref name=\"JMSemotion\">{{cite newsgroup |title=Alien looking aliens |author=Straczynski, J.

One of three conductors would also be required for any score that involved more than 6 musicians. Franke would direct recording sessions via six fibre optic digital telephone lines to transmit and receive video, music and the [[SMPTE timecode]]. The final edit and mixing of the tracks would take place in his Los Angeles studio. Initially concerned composing for an episodic television show could become \"annoying because of the repetition\", Franke found the evolving characters and story of ''Babylon 5'' afforded him the opportunity to continually \"push the envelope\".<ref name=\"ChrisFranke1\"/><ref name=\"ChrisFranke2\"/>\n\n{{quotation|Assembling music written for the series' final episode, Sleeping in Light succinctly encapsulates just how far Franke's sensibilities evolved over the course of Babylon 5's five-year production run \u2013 the synthesizer textures and martial percussion so long a fixture of the series' musical palette are now enhanced by strings and guitars that emphasize the deeply human emotional dimensions of the interstellar drama.

Three compilation albums were also produced, containing extensively re-orchestrated and remixed musical passages taken from throughout the series to create more elaborate suites.

Wars between separate alien civilizations are featured. The conflict between the [[Narn]] and the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] is followed from its beginnings as a minor territorial dispute amplified by historical animosity, through to its end, in which [[weapons of mass destruction]] are employed to subjugate and enslave a planet. The war is an attempt to portray a more sobering kind of conflict than usually seen on science fiction television. Informed by the events of the first [[Gulf War]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Prague Spring#Invasion|invasion of Prague]], the intent was to recreate these moments when \"the world held its breath\" and the emotional core of the conflict was the disbelief that the situation could have occurred at all, and the desperation to find a way to bring it to an end.<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=Coming of Shadows |author=Straczynski, J.

He only recovers physically and socially and breaks the cycle at the end of the season. His eventual replacement as Chief of Security, [[Zack Allan]], was given a second chance by Garibaldi after overcoming his own addiction to an unspecified drug. Dr. [[Stephen Franklin (Babylon 5)|Stephen Franklin]] develops an (initially unrecognized) addiction to injectable [[stimulant]] drugs while trying to cope with the chronic stress and work overload in Medlab, and wanders off to the homeless and deprived in Brown Sector, where he suffers through a severe [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] syndrome.

A number of short stories and novels were also produced between 1995 and 2001. Additional books were published by the gaming companies Chameleon Eclectic and [[Mongoose Publishing]], to support their desk-top strategy and [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] games.\n\nThree telefilms were released by [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|Turner Network Television]] (TNT) in 1998, after funding a fifth season of ''Babylon 5'', following the demise of the [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]] the previous year. In addition to ''[[Babylon 5: In the Beginning|In the Beginning]]'', ''[[Babylon 5: Thirdspace|Thirdspace]]'', and ''[[Babylon 5: The River of Souls|The River of Souls]]'', they released a re-edited special edition of the original 1993 telefilm, ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering|The Gathering]]''. In 1999, a fifth telefilm was also produced, ''[[Babylon 5: A Call to Arms|A Call to Arms]]'', which acted as a pilot movie for the spin-off series ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'', which TNT cancelled after 13 episodes had been filmed.\n\n[[Dell Publishing]] started publication of a series of ''Babylon 5'' novels in 1995, which were ostensibly considered canon within the TV series' continuity, nominally supervised by creator J. Michael Straczynski, with later novels in the line being more directly based upon Straczynski's own notes and story outlines. In 1997, [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] obtained the publication license from Warner Bros., and proceeded to release a number of original trilogies directly scenarized by Straczynski, as well as novelizations of three of the TNT telefilms (''In the Beginning, Thirdspace'', and ''A Call to Arms''). All of the Del Rey novels are considered completely canonical within the filmic ''Babylon 5'' universe.\n\nIn 2000, the [[Syfy Universal|Sci-Fi Channel]] purchased the rights to rerun the ''Babylon 5'' series, and premiered a new telefilm, ''[[Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers|The Legend of the Rangers]]'' in 2002, which failed to be picked up as a series. In 2007, the first in a planned anthology of straight-to-DVD short stories entitled, ''[[Babylon 5: The Lost Tales|The Lost Tales]]'', was released by [[Warner Home Video]], but no others were produced, due to funding issues.<ref>{{cite web |title=from jms: update|author=Straczynski, J.

He stated that he believed that Warner Bros. felt snubbed by having the show's initial run on a rival network, and would insist that all production on it must be handled within the Warner Bros. studios. While he holds the movie rights to ''Babylon 5'', Straczynski stated it was difficult to convince another studio to work with it, as they would want both television and movie rights within the same house.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/a-babylon-5-television-revival-or-movie-in-your-dreams-says-j-michael-straczynski | title=  A Babylon 5 Television Revival Or Movie?

Beginning with the original telefilm, ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering|The Gathering]]'', these were [[PAL]] tapes, showing video in the same [[Aspect ratio (image)#Current video standards|4:3 aspect ratio]] as the initial television broadcasts. By the release of Season 2, tapes included [[closed captioning]] of dialogue and [[Dolby Surround]] sound. [[Columbia House]] began distributing [[NTSC]] tapes, via mail order in 1997, followed by repackaged collector's editions and three-tape [[box sets|boxed sets]] in 1999, by which time the original pilot telefilm had been replaced by the re-edited TNT special edition. Additional movie and complete season boxed-sets were also released by Warner Bros. until 2000.\n\n[[Image Entertainment]] released ''Babylon 5'' [[laserdiscs]] between December 1998 and September 1999. Produced on double-sided 12-inch [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] discs, each contained two episodes displayed in the 4:3 broadcast aspect-ratio, with Dolby Surround audio and closed captioning for the dialogue. Starting with two TNT telefilms, ''[[Babylon 5: In the Beginning|In the Beginning]]'' and the re-edited special edition of ''The Gathering'', Seasons 1 and 5 were released simultaneously over a six-month period.

Each included a printed booklet containing episode summaries, with each disc containing audio options for German, French, and English, plus [[wikt:Special:Search/subtitle|subtitles]] in a wider range of languages, including Arabic and Dutch. Video was digitally remastered from original broadcast masters and displayed in [[anamorphic widescreen]] for superior presentation with remastered and remixed [[Dolby Digital]] [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]] sound. Disc 1 of each set contained an introduction to the season by [[J. Michael Straczynski]], while disc 6 included [[featurettes]] containing interviews with various production staff, as well as information on the [[fictional universe]], and a [[gag reel]]. Three episodes in each season also contained commentary from either Straczynski, members of the main cast, and/or the episode director.\n\nSince its initial release, a number of repackaged DVD boxed sets have been produced for various [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|regional markets]]. With slightly altered [[cover art]], they included no additional content, but the discs were more securely stored in slimline cases, rather than the early \"book\" format, with hard plastic pages used during the original release of the first three seasons.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"80%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 0\"|'''Initial DVD release'''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"| '''Episode box sets''' || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]] || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 4]]\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete First Season || Nov 5, 2002 || Oct 28, 2002 || Nov 27, 2002\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Second Season || April 29, 2003 || May 26, 2003 || Jul 9, 2003\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Third Season || Aug 12, 2003 || Nov 10, 2003 || Dec 19, 2003\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em\" align=\"left\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Fourth Season || Jan 6, 2004 || April 19, 2004 || Aug 19, 2004\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Fifth Season || April 13, 2004 || Jan 2005 || Dec 16, 2004\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series || Aug 17, 2004 || N/A || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Universe (inc. all movies and Crusade episodes)|| N/A || October 24, 2005 || N/A\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 0\"|'''Movie releases and box sets'''\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Gathering / In the Beginning || Dec 4, 2001 || N/A || Nov 21, 2001\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Gathering || N/A || April 8, 2002 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: In the Beginning || N/A || April 8, 2002 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Movie Collection || Aug 17, 2004 || N/A || Mar 2, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: Movie Box Set || N/A || Feb 21, 2005 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers || March 14, 2006 || Oct 24, 2005 || Nov 16, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Lost Tales || July 31, 2007 || Sep 3, 2007 || Jan 2, 2008\n|}\n\n=== Mastering problems ===\nWhile the series was in pre-production, studios were looking at ways for their existing shows to make the transition from the then-standard [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|4:3 aspect ratio]] to the [[widescreen]] formats that would accompany the next generation of televisions.

It was first written to run on [[BeBox]] hardware. BeOS was built for digital media work and was written to take advantage of modern hardware facilities such as [[symmetric multiprocessing]] by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth, pervasive multithreading, [[preemptive multitasking]] and a [[64-bit]] [[journaling file system]] known as [[Be File System|BFS]]. The BeOS GUI was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean, uncluttered design.\n\nThe [[application programming interface|API]] was written in [[C++]] for ease of programming. It has partial [[POSIX]] compatibility and access to a [[command-line interface]] through [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]], although internally it is not a [[Unix]]-derived operating system.\n\nBeOS used [[Unicode]] as the default encoding in the GUI, though support for input methods such as [[bidirectional text]] input was never realized.\n\nBeOS was positioned as a multimedia platform that  could be used by a substantial population of desktop users and a competitor to [[Classic Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was ultimately unable to achieve a significant market share, however, and proved commercially unviable for Be Inc. The company was acquired by [[Palm Inc.]] and today BeOS is mainly used and developed by a small population of enthusiasts.\n\nThe open-source OS [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]], a complete reimplementation of BeOS, is designed to start up where BeOS left off. Beta 1 of Haiku was released in September 2018, 6 years after Alpha 4.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Haiku Release 1 Beta 1|date=September 28, 2018|url=https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2018_09_28_haiku_r1_beta1/|work=Haiku-OS.org|volume=|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929134523/https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2018_09_28_haiku_r1_beta1/|archivedate=2018-09-29}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nInitially designed to run on [[AT&T Hobbit]]-based hardware, BeOS was later modified to run on [[PowerPC]]-based processors: first Be's own systems, later [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[PowerPC Reference Platform]] and [[Common Hardware Reference Platform]], with the hope that Apple would purchase or license BeOS as a replacement for its aging [[Classic Mac OS]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://macreate.net/reloaded/?q=node/view/149 | title=BeOS @ MaCreate | date=2004-11-24 | author=Tom | accessdate=2006-11-16 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324220739/http://macreate.net/reloaded/?q=node%2Fview%2F149 | archivedate=2005-03-24 | deadurl=yes | df= }}</ref> Apple CEO [[Gil Amelio]] started negotiations to buy Be Inc., but negotiations stalled when Be CEO [[Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e]] wanted $300 million;<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tom|first1=Hormby|title=The Rise and Fall of Apple\u2019s Gil Amelio|url=http://lowendmac.com/2013/the-rise-and-fall-of-apples-gil-amelio/|website=Low End Mac|publisher=Cobweb Publishing, Inc.|accessdate=28 March 2015}}</ref> Apple was unwilling to offer any more than $125 million.

The number of classification schemes and the variety of determinants used in those schemes, however, should be taken as strong indicators that biomes do not fit perfectly into the classification schemes created.\n\n===Holdridge (1947, 1964) life zones===\n{{Main|Holdridge life zones}}\nHoldridge classified climates based on the biological effects of temperature and [[rainfall]] on [[vegetation]] under the assumption that these two [[abiotic]] factors are the largest determinants of the types of vegetation found in a habitat. Holdridge uses the four axes to define 30 so-called \"humidity provinces\", which are clearly visible in his diagram.

His scheme can be seen as a simplification of Holdridge's; more readily accessible, but missing Holdridge's greater specificity.\n\nWhittaker based his approach on theoretical assertions and empirical sampling. He was in a unique position to make such a holistic assertion because he had previously compiled a review of biome classifications.<ref>Whittaker, Robert H., Botanical Review, Classification of Natural Communities, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Jan\u2013Mar 1962), pp. 1\u2013239.</ref>\n\n====Key definitions for understanding Whittaker's scheme====\n* [[Physiognomy]]: the apparent characteristics, outward features, or appearance of ecological communities or species.\n* Biome: a grouping of terrestrial ecosystems on a given continent that is similar in vegetation structure, physiognomy, features of the environment and characteristics of their animal communities.\n* [[Formation (vegetation)|Formation]]: a major kind of community of plants on a given continent.\n* Biome-type: grouping of convergent biomes or formations of different continents, defined by physiognomy.\n* Formation-type: a grouping of convergent formations.\n\nWhittaker's distinction between biome and formation can be simplified: formation is used when applied to [[plant communities]] only, while biome is used when concerned with both plants and animals. Whittaker's convention of biome-type or formation-type is simply a broader method to categorize similar communities.<ref name=\"Whittaker1975\">Whittaker, Robert H. Communities and Ecosystems.

Whittaker considered four main ecoclines in the terrestrial realm.<ref name=\"Whittaker1975\"/>\n# Intertidal levels: The wetness gradient of areas that are exposed to alternating water and dryness with intensities that vary by location from high to low tide\n# Climatic moisture gradient\n# Temperature gradient by altitude\n# Temperature gradient by latitude\n\nAlong these gradients, Whittaker noted several trends that allowed him to qualitatively establish biome-types:\n* The gradient runs from favorable to the extreme, with corresponding changes in productivity.\n* Changes in physiognomic complexity vary with how favorable of an environment exists (decreasing community structure and reduction of stratal differentiation as the environment becomes less favorable).\n* Trends in the diversity of structure follow trends in species diversity; alpha and beta species diversities decrease from favorable to extreme environments.\n* Each growth-form (i.e. grasses, shrubs, etc.) has its characteristic place of maximum importance along the ecoclines.\n* The same growth forms may be dominant in similar environments in widely different parts of the world.\n\nWhittaker summed the effects of gradients (3) and (4) to get an overall temperature gradient and combined this with a gradient (2), the moisture gradient, to express the above conclusions in what is known as the Whittaker classification scheme. The scheme graphs average annual precipitation (x-axis) versus average annual temperature (y-axis) to classify biome-types.\n\n====Biome-types====\n# Tropical rainforest\n# Tropical seasonal rainforest\n#* deciduous\n#* semideciduous\n# Temperate giant rainforest\n# Montane rainforest\n# Temperate deciduous forest\n# Temperate evergreen forest\n#* needleleaf\n#* sclerophyll\n# Subarctic-subalpin needle-leaved forests (taiga)\n# Elfin woodland\n# Thorn forests and woodlands\n# Thorn scrub\n# Temperate woodland\n# Temperate shrublands\n#* deciduous\n#* heath\n#* sclerophyll\n#* subalpine-needleleaf\n#* subalpine-broadleaf\n# Savanna\n# Temperate grassland\n# Alpine grasslands\n# Tundra\n# Tropical desert\n# Warm-temperate desert\n# Cool temperate desert scrub\n# Arctic-alpine desert\n# Bog\n# Tropical fresh-water swamp forest\n# Temperate fresh-water swamp forest\n# Mangrove swamp\n# Salt marsh\n# Wetland<ref>Whittaker, R.

He subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of North America in 1981, and the world in 1989. The Bailey system, based on climate, is divided into seven domains (polar, humid temperate, dry, humid, and humid tropical), with further divisions based on other climate characteristics (subarctic, warm temperate, hot temperate, and subtropical; marine and continental; lowland and mountain).<ref>http://www.fs.fed.us/land/ecosysmgmt/index.html Bailey System, US Forest Service</ref><ref>Bailey, R.

Consumers recognise needs or wants, and go through a process to satisfy these needs. Consumer behavior is the process they go through as customers, which includes types of products purchased, amount spent, frequency of purchases and what influences them to make the purchase decision or not. There is a lot that influences consumer behavior, with contributions from both internal and external factors<ref name=\":0\" /> (Szwacka-Mokrzycka, 2015). Internal factors include attitudes, needs, motives, preferences and perceptual processes, whilst external factors include marketing activities, social and economic factors, and cultural aspects<ref name=\":0\" /> (Szwacka-Mokrzycka, 2015). Doctor Lars Perner of the University of Southern California claims that there are also physical factors that influence consumer behavior, for example if a consumer is hungry, then this physical feeling of hunger will influence them so that they go and purchase a sandwich to satisfy the hunger<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/intro_Consumer_Behavior.html|title=Consumer Behaviour|last=Perner|first=Lars|date=2008|website=Consumer Psychologist|publisher=|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref> (Perner, 2008).\n\n'''Consumer decision making'''\n\nThere is a model described by Lars Perner which illustrates the decision making process with regards to consumer behavior. It begins with recognition of a problem, the consumer recognises a need or want which has not been satisfied. This leads the consumer to search for information, if it is a low involvement product then the search will be internal, identifying alternatives purely from memory. If the product is high involvement then the search be more thorough, such as reading reviews or reports or asking friends. The consumer will then evaluate his or her alternatives, comparing price, quality, doing trade-offs between products and narrowing down the choice by eliminating the less appealing products until there is one left. After this has been identified, the consumer will purchase the product. Finally the consumer will evaluate the purchase decision, and the purchased product, bringing in factors such as value for money, quality of goods and purchase experience<ref name=\":1\" /> (Model taken from Perner, 2008).\n\n'''How the 4P's influence consumer behavior'''\n\nThe [[Marketing mix|4 P's]] are a marketing tool, and stand for Price, Promotion, Product and Place or Product Placement<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Clemons|first=Eric|date=2008|title=How Information Changes Consumer Behavior and How Consumer Behavior Determines Corporate Strategy|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=32c58928-1d36-4594-90d4-e5f7569a77f1%40sessionmgr198&vid=0&hid=116&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl&preview=false#AN=34879420&db=bth|journal=Journal of Management Information Systems|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref> (Clemons, 2008).  Consumer behavior is influenced greatly by business to consumer marketing, so being a prominent marketing tool, the 4 P's will have an effect on consumer's behavior. The price of a good or service is largely determined by the market, as businesses will set their prices to be similar to that of other business so as to remain competitive whilst making a profit<ref name=\":2\" /> (Clemons, 2008). When market prices for a product are high, it will cause consumers to purchase less and use purchased goods for longer periods of time, meaning they are purchasing the product less often. Alternatively, when market prices for a product are low, consumers are more likely to purchase more of the product, and more often. The way that promotion influences consumer behavior has changed over time. In the past, large promotional campaigns and lots of advertising would convert into sales for a business, but nowadays businesses can have success on products with little or no advertising<ref name=\":2\" /> (Clemons, 2008). This is due to the internet, and in particular social media. They rely on word of mouth from consumers using social media, and as products trend online, so sales increase as products effectively promote themselves<ref name=\":2\" /> (Clemons, 2008). Thus, promotion by businesses does not necessarily result in consumer behavior trending towards purchasing products.  The way that product influences consumer behavior is through consumer willingness to pay, and consumer preferences<ref name=\":2\" /> (Clemons, 2008). This means that even if a company were to have a long history of products in the market, consumers will still pick a cheaper product over the company in question's product if it means they will pay less for something that is very similar<ref name=\":2\" /> (Clemons, 2008). This is due to consumer willingness to pay, or their willingness to part with their money they have earned. Product also influences consumer behavior through customer preferences. For example, take Pepsi vs Coca-Cola, a Pepsi drinker is less likely to purchase Coca-Cola, even if it is cheaper and more convenient. This is due to the preference of the consumer, and no matter how hard the opposing company tries they will not be able to force the customer to change their mind. Product placement in the modern era has little influence on consumer behavior, due to the availability of goods online<ref name=\":2\" /> (Clemons, 2008). If a customer can purchase a good from the comfort of their home instead of purchasing in-store, then the placement of products is not going to influence their purchase decision.\n\n==In management==\n\n'''Behavior outside of psychology includes''':\n\n===Organizational===\n\nIn management, behaviors are associated with desired or undesired focuses.  Managers generally note what the desired outcome is, but behavioral patterns can take over.  These patterns are the reference to how often the desired behavior actually occurs.  Before a behavior actually occurs, antecedents focus on the stimuli that influence the behavior that is about to happen.  After the behavior occurs, consequences fall into place.  Consequences consist of rewards or punishments.\n\n===Social behavior===\n{{Main|Social behavior}}\n\n== Behavior informatics ==\n[[Behavior informatics]]<ref name=\":3\"/> also called [[behavior computing]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Behavior Computing: Modeling, Analysis, Mining and Decision|last=Cao|first=L.|last2=Yu|first2=P.

Health behaviors are direct factors in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Health behaviors are influenced by the social, cultural and physical environments in which we live and work. They are shaped by individual choices and external constraints. Positive behaviors help promote health and prevent disease, while the opposite is true for risk behaviors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-229-x/2009001/deter/int3-eng.htm|title=Health behaviours|author=|date=11 January 2010|work=statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref> Health behaviors are early indicators of population health. Because of the time lag that often occurs between certain behaviors and the development of disease, these indicators may foreshadow the future burdens and benefits of health-risk and health-promoting behaviors. Health behaviors do not occur in isolation\u2014they are influenced and constrained by social and cultural norms.\n\n===Correlates===\n\nA variety of studies have examined the relationship between health behaviors and health outcomes (e.g., Blaxter 1990) and have demonstrated their role in both morbidity and mortality.\n\nThese studies have identified seven features of lifestyle which were associated with lower morbidity and higher subsequent long-term survival (Belloc and Breslow 1972):\n* Avoiding snacks\n* Eating  breakfast regularly\n* Exercising regularly\n* Maintaining a desirable body weight\n* Moderate alcohol intake\n* Not smoking\n* Sleeping 7\u20138h per night\n\nHealth behaviors impact upon individuals' quality of life, by delaying the onset of chronic disease and extending active lifespan. Smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, gaps in primary care services and low screening uptake are all significant determinants of poor health, and changing such behaviors should lead to improved health.\nFor example, in USA, Healthy People 2000, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (USDHHS), lists increased physical activity, changes in nutrition and reductions in tobacco, alcohol and drug use as important for health promotion and disease prevention.\n\n===Treatment approach===\n\nAny interventions done are matched with the needs of each individual in an ethical and respected manner. [[Health belief model|HBM]] encourages increasing individuals' perceived susceptibility to negative health outcomes and making individuals aware of the severity of such negative health behavior outcomes. E.g. through health promotion messages. In addition, the HBM suggests the need to focus on the benefits of health behaviors and the fact that barriers to action are easily overcome. The [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB) suggests using persuasive messages for tackling behavioral beliefs to increase the readiness to perform a behavior, called ''intentions''. TPB advocates the need to tackle normative beliefs and control beliefs in any attempt to change behavior. Challenging the normative beliefs isn't enough but to follow through the ''intention'' with self-efficacy from individual's mastery in problem solving and task completion is important to bring about a positive change.<ref>Gollwitzer 1993</ref> Self efficacy is often cemented through standard persuasive techniques.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|Medicine|Psychology|Sex|Sociology}}\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Applied behavior analysis]]\n* [[Behavioral cusp]]\n* [[Behavioral economics]]\n* [[Behavioral genetics]]\n* [[Behavioural sciences|Behavioral sciences]]\n* [[Behaviorism]]\n* [[Cognitive bias]]\n* [[Ethology]]\n* [[Evolutionary physiology]]\n* [[Experimental analysis of behavior]]\n* [[Human sexual behavior]]\n* [[Herd behavior]]\n* [[Instinct]]\n* [[Motivation]]\n* [[Normality (behavior)]]\n* [[Organizational studies]]\n* [[Radical behaviorism]]\n* [[Reasoning]]\n* [[Rebellion]]\n* [[Social relation]]\n* [[Theories of political behavior]]\n* [[Work behavior]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n;General\n* Cao, L.

It was fought between the citizens of [[History of Athens|Athens]], aided by [[Plataea]], and a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] force commanded by [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]]. The battle was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia, under King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], to subjugate [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. The Greek army decisively defeated the more numerous Persians, marking a turning point in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]].\n\nThe first Persian invasion was a response to Athenian involvement in the [[Ionian Revolt]], when Athens and [[Eretria]] had sent a force to support the cities of [[Ionia]] in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning [[Sardis]], but they were then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, Darius swore to burn down Athens and Eretria. According to [[Herodotus]], Darius had his bow brought to him and then shot an arrow \"upwards towards heaven\", saying as he did so: \"Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!\". Herodotus further writes that Darius charged one of his servants to say \"Master, remember the Athenians\" three times before dinner each day.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh5100.htm Herodotus Book 5: Terpsichore, 105] \"...he inquired into who the Athenians were; and when he had been informed, he asked for his bow, and having received it and placed an arrow upon the string, he discharged it upwards towards heaven, and as he shot into the air he said: \"Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!\" Having so said he charged one of his attendants, that when dinner was set before the king he should say always three times: \"Master, remember the Athenians.\"\"</ref>\n\nAt the time of the battle, [[Sparta]] and Athens were the two largest city-states in Greece. Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the [[Battle of Lade]] in 494 BC, Darius began plans to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], to subjugate the [[Cyclades]], and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching [[Euboea]] in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria. The Persian force then sailed for [[Attica]], landing in the bay near the town of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]]. The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. The Athenians also sent a message asking for support to the Spartans. When the messenger arrived in Sparta, the Spartans were involved in a religious festival and gave this as a reason for not coming to aid of the Athenians.\n\nThe Athenians and their allies chose a location for the battle, with marshes and mountainous terrain, that prevented the [[Achaemenid Empire#Cavalry|Persian cavalry]] from joining the Persian infantry. [[Miltiades]], the Athenian general, ordered a general attack against the Persian forces, composed primarily of missile troops. He reinforced his flanks, luring the Persians' best fighters into his center. The inward wheeling flanks enveloped the Persians, routing them. The Persian army broke in panic towards their ships, and large numbers were slaughtered. The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece, and the Persian force retreated to Asia. Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. After Darius died, his son [[Xerxes I]] restarted the preparations for a [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second invasion of Greece]], which finally began in 480 BC.\n\nThe Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars can be seen to begin at Marathon. The battle also showed the Greeks that they were able to win battles without the Spartans, as they had heavily relied on Sparta previously. This victory was largely due to the Athenians, and Marathon raised Greek esteem of them. Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society, the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in Mediterranean and European history.\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Main article|Herodotus}}\n\nThe main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. Herodotus, who has been called the \"Father of History\",<ref>Cicero, On the Laws I, 5</ref> was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his ''Enquiries'' (Greek \u2013 ''Historia''; English \u2013 ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440\u2013430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ended in 450 BC).<ref name = hxvi/> Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented \"history\" as we know it.<ref name = hxvi/> As Holland has it: \"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\"<ref name = hxvi>Holland, pp. xvi\u2013xvii.</ref>\n\nSome subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].<ref>Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g., [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&layout=&loc=1.22 I, 22]</ref><ref name = Fin15>Finley, p. 15.</ref> Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and may therefore have felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.<ref name = Fin15/> [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay ''[[On the malice of Herodotus]]'', describing Herodotus as \"''Philobarbaros''\" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.<ref>Holland, p. xxiv.</ref> A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm#1|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105636/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = January 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.<ref name = h377>Holland, p. 377.</ref> The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historia'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.<ref name = h377/> Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.<ref>Fehling, pp. 1\u2013277.</ref>\n\nThe Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&layout=&loc=11.28 Bibliotheca Historica]</ref> The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]]. Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]], also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.<ref>Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=9.81.1 IX, 81]</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main article|Greco-Persian Wars|Ionian Revolt|First Persian invasion of Greece}}\n\n[[File:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|A map showing the Greek world at the time of the battle]]\nThe first Persian invasion of Greece had its immediate roots in the [[Ionian Revolt]], the earliest phase of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the Greeks and Persians. In 500 BC the Persian Empire was still relatively young and highly expansionistic, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.<ref name = h47>Holland, pp. 47\u201355</ref><ref name = h58>Holland, pp. 58\u201362</ref><ref name=\"h203\"/> Moreover, the Persian King Darius was a [[usurper]], and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.<ref name = h47/> Even before the Ionian Revolt, Darius had begun to expand the empire into Europe, subjugating [[Thrace]], and forcing [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] to become [[Achaemenid Macedonia|a vassal]] of Persia.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=343}}  Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of ancient Greece may have been inevitable.<ref name = h58/> However, the Ionian Revolt had directly threatened the integrity of the Persian empire, and the states of mainland Greece remained a potential menace to its future stability.<ref name = h171>Holland, 171\u201378</ref> Darius thus resolved to subjugate and pacify Greece and the Aegean, and to punish those involved in the Ionian Revolt.<ref name = h171/><ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.105 V, 105]</ref>\n\nThe Ionian Revolt had begun with an unsuccessful [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|expedition]] against [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|Naxos]], a joint venture between the Persian satrap [[Artaphernes]] and the [[Miletus|Milesian]] tyrant [[Aristagoras]].<ref name = h154>Holland, pp. 154\u201357</ref> In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy.<ref name = h154/> The other [[Ionia]]n cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies.<ref name = h154/><ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.98 V, 97]</ref> Aristagoras then appealed to the states of mainland Greece for support, but only [[History of Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] offered to send troops.<ref name = h157>Holland, pp. 157\u201361</ref>\n\nThe involvement of Athens in the Ionian Revolt arose from a complex set of circumstances, beginning with the establishment of the [[Athenian Democracy]] in the late 6th century BC.<ref name = h157/>\n\nIn 510 BC, with the aid of [[Cleomenes I]], King of [[Sparta]], the Athenian people had expelled [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]], the [[tyrant]] ruler of Athens.<ref name = V65>Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.65 V, 65]</ref> With Hippias's father [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]], the family had ruled for 36 out of the previous 50 years and fully intended to continue Hippias's rule.<ref name = V65/> Hippias fled to [[Sardis]] to the court of the Persian [[satrap]], [[Artaphernes]] and promised control of Athens to the Persians if they were to help restore him.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.97 V, 96]</ref> In the meantime, Cleomenes helped install a pro-Spartan tyranny under [[Isagoras]] in Athens, in opposition to [[Cleisthenes]], the leader of the traditionally powerful [[Alcmaeonidae]] family, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the rule of Athens.<ref name = h131>Holland, pp. 131\u201332</ref> Cleisthenes, however, found himself being politically defeated by a coalition led by Isagoras and decided to change the rules of the game by appealing to the ''demos'' (the people), in effect making them a new faction in the political arena. This tactic succeeded, but the Spartan King, Cleomenes I, returned at the request of Isagoras and so Cleisthenes, the Alcmaeonids and other prominent Athenian families were exiled from Athens. When Isagoras attempted to create a narrow oligarchic government, the Athenian people, in a spontaneous and unprecedented move, expelled Cleomenes and Isagoras.<ref name = \"h133\">Holland, pp. 133\u201336</ref> Cleisthenes was thus restored to Athens (507 BC), and at breakneck speed began to reform the state with the aim of securing his position.

Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), but it is not clear why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans.<ref name = L59/> There are two main theories to explain this.<ref name = L59/>\n\nThe first theory is that the Persian cavalry left Marathon for an unspecified reason, and that the Greeks moved to take advantage of this by attacking. This theory is based on the absence of any mention of cavalry in Herodotus' account of the battle, and an entry in the ''[[Suda]]'' dictionary.<ref name = L59/> The entry ''\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u1f30\u03c0\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2'' (\"without cavalry\") is explained thus: <blockquote>The cavalry left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the Ionians climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the cavalry had left. And when [[Miltiades]] realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before battle.<ref>[[Suda]], entry ''Without cavalry''</ref></blockquote> There are many variations of this theory, but perhaps the most prevalent is that the cavalry were completing the time-consuming process of re-embarking on the ships, and were to be sent by sea to attack (undefended) Athens in the rear, whilst the rest of the Persians pinned down the Athenian army at Marathon.<ref name = h187/> This theory therefore utilises Herodotus' suggestion that after Marathon, the Persian army began to re-embark, intending to sail around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.<ref name = VI115>Herodotus [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng1:6.115.1 VI, 115]</ref> Thus, this re-embarcation would have occurred ''before'' the battle (and indeed have triggered the battle).<ref name = h191/>\n\nThe second theory is simply that the battle occurred because the Persians finally moved to attack the Athenians.<ref name = L59/> Although this theory has the Persians moving to the ''strategic'' offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the Persians by assuming that, seeing the Persians advancing, the Athenians took the ''tactical'' offensive, and attacked them.<ref name = L59/> Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply that there was some kind of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle.<ref name = L59/> It is also possible that both theories are correct: when the Persians sent the cavalry by ship to attack Athens, they simultaneously sent their infantry to attack at Marathon, triggering the Greek counterattack.\n\n=== Date of the battle ===\nHerodotus mentions for several events a date in the [[lunisolar calendar]], of which each Greek city-state used a variant.  Astronomical computation allows us to derive an absolute date in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]] which is much used by historians as the chronological frame. [[Philipp August B\u00f6ckh]] in 1855  concluded that the battle took place on September 12, 490 BC in the Julian calendar, and this is the conventionally accepted date.<ref name = date/>  However, this depends on when exactly the Spartans held their festival and it is possible that the Spartan calendar was one month ahead of that of Athens.

In order to face the Persians in battle, the Athenians had to summon all available [[hoplite]]s;<ref name = h187/> and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1.<ref name = L56/> Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear would cut the army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against.<ref name = h191/> Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered.<ref name = h187/> However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially had no need to seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, time worked in their favour, as every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer.<ref name = h187/><ref name = L59/> Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by waiting, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle.<ref name = L59/> Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians even more of a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.<ref name = h191/>\n\nThe Persian strategy, on the other hand, was probably principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and no match for hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].<ref name = L256>Lazenby, p. 256</ref>) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably a reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.<ref name = h191/>\n\nWhatever event eventually triggered the battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians to attack the Persians. If the first theory is correct (see [[#Prelude|above]]), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, and the threat of being outflanked made it imperative to attack.<ref name = h191/> Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them.<ref name = L59/> Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians;<ref>Lazenby, p. 67</ref> the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view.<ref name = L256/> If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements.<ref name = L59/> Alternatively, they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory\u2014they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.<ref name = L59/>\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:They crashed into Persian army with tremendous force.jpg|thumb|\"They crashed into the Persian army with tremendous force\", [https://archive.org/stream/storyofgreecetol00macg#page/136/mode/2up illustration] by Walter Crane in Mary Macgregor, ''The Story of Greece Told to Boys and Girls'', London: T.C. & E.C.

Most scholars believe that the Greeks had better equipment and used superior tactics. According to Herodotus, the Greeks were better equipped. They did not use bronze upper body armour at this time, but that of leather or linen. The [[phalanx]] formation proved successful, because the hoplites had a long tradition in hand-to-hand combat, whereas the Persian soldiers were accustomed to a very different kind of conflict. At Marathon, the Athenians thinned their centre in order to make their army equal in length to the Persian army,<ref>Herod. Histories 6.111,3</ref> not as a result of a tactical planning.<ref>Lazenby 258</ref> It seems that the Persian centre tried to return, realizing that their wings had broken, and was caught in the flanks by the victorious Greek wings. Lazenby (1993)  believes that the ultimate reason for the Greek success was the courage the Greeks displayed:\n<blockquote> Marathon was won because ordinary, amateur soldiers found the courage to break into a trot when the arrows begun to fall, instead of grinding to a halt, and when surprisingly the enemy wings fled, not to take the easy way out and follow them, but to stop and somehow come to the aid of the hard pressured centre.<ref>Lazenby p. 258</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Vic Hurley]], the Persian defeat is explained by the \"complete failure ... to field a representative army\", calling the battle the \"most convincing\" example of the fact that infantry-bowmen cannot defend any position while stationed in close-quarters and unsupported<ref>[[Vic Hurley]], ''Arrows Against Steel: The History of the Bow and how it Forever Changed Warfare'', Cerberus Books, 2011, {{ISBN|9780983475613}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j64zo7pzt3sC&lpg=PA66&pg=PA66 p. 66]</ref> (i.e. by fortifications, or failing to support them by [[Achaemenid Empire#Cavalry|cavalry and chariots]], as was the common Persian tactic).\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Main article|Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.<ref name = VI115/> As has been discussed [[#Prelude|above]], some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle.

This style had developed during internecine warfare amongst the Greeks; since each city-state fought in the same way, the advantages and disadvantages of the hoplite phalanx had not been obvious.<ref name = \"h194\">Holland, pp. 194\u201397</ref> Marathon was the first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how effective the hoplites could be in battle.<ref name = \"h194\"/> The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the [[Battle of Plataea]]), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon.<ref name = \"h344\">Holland, pp. 344\u201352</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Legends associated with the battle ===\n[[File:Pan satyre della Valle.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|Statue of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], [[Capitoline Museum]], Rome]]\n\nThe most famous legend associated with Marathon is that of the runner [[Pheidippides]] (or Philippides) bringing news to Athens of the battle, which is described [[#Marathon run|below]].\n\nPheidippides' run to Sparta to bring aid has other legends associated with it. Herodotus mentions that Pheidippides was visited by the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] on his way to Sparta (or perhaps on his return journey).<ref name = \"h187\"/> Pan asked why the Athenians did not honor him and the awed Pheidippides promised that they would do so from then on. The god apparently felt that the promise would be kept, so he appeared in battle and at the crucial moment he instilled the Persians with his own brand of fear, the mindless, frenzied fear that bore his name: \"[[panic]]\". After the battle, a sacred precinct was established for Pan in a grotto on the north slope of the Acropolis, and a sacrifice was annually offered.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.105 VI, 105]</ref>\n\nSimilarly, after the victory the festival of the ''Agroteras Thysia'' (\"sacrifice to the Agrot\u00e9ra\") was held at [[Agrae]] near [[Athens]], in honor of [[Artemis]] [[Agrotera]] (\"Artemis the Huntress\"). This was in fulfillment of a vow made by the city before the battle, to offer in sacrifice a number of goats equal to that of the [[Persia]]ns slain in the conflict. The number was so great, it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until the number was filled. [[Xenophon]] notes that at his time, 90 years after the battle, goats were still offered yearly.<ref>Plutarch, ''On the Malice of Herodotus'', 26</ref><ref>Xenophon, ''Anabasis'' III, 2</ref><ref>Aelian, ''Varia Historia'' II, 25</ref><ref>Aristophanes, ''The Knights'', 660</ref>\n\nPlutarch mentions that the Athenians saw the phantom of King [[Theseus]], the mythical hero of Athens, leading the army in full battle gear in the charge against the Persians,<ref>Plutarch, ''Theseus'', 35</ref> and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the [[Stoa Poikile]] fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes.<ref>Pausanias I, 15</ref> Pausanias also tells us that: <blockquote>They say too that there chanced to be present in the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor [[Echetlaeus]] (\"he of the Plough-tail\") as a hero.<ref name=\"Pausanias I, 32\"/></blockquote>\n\nAnother tale from the conflict is of the dog of Marathon. [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] relates that one hoplite brought his dog to the Athenian encampment. The dog followed his master to battle and attacked the Persians at his master's side. He also informs us that this dog is depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile.<ref>Aelian, ''On the Nature of Animals'' VII, 38</ref>\n\n=== Marathon run ===\n{{Main article|Marathon}}\nAccording to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named [[Pheidippides]] was sent to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for assistance before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta the day after he left.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.105 VI, 105\u201306]</ref> Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, in time to see the Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.<ref name = \"h198\">Holland, p. 198</ref>\n\n[[File:1896 Olympic marathon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Burton Holmes]]' photograph entitled ''\"1896: Three athletes in training for the marathon at the Olympic Games in Athens\"''.]]\nLater, in popular imagination, these two events became confused with each other, leading to a legendary but inaccurate version of events. This myth has Pheidippides running from Marathon to Athens after the battle, to announce the Greek victory with the word \"nenik\u0113kamen!\" ([[Ancient Greek|Attic]]: {{lang|grc|\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd}}; we've won!), whereupon he promptly died of exhaustion. Most accounts incorrectly attribute this story to Herodotus{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}; actually, the story first appears in [[Plutarch]]'s ''On the Glory of Athens'' in the 1st century AD, who quotes from [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heracleides of Pontus]]'s lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles.<ref>Plutarch, ''Moralia'', 347C</ref> [[Lucian of Samosata]] (2nd century AD) gives the same story but names the runner Philippides (not Pheidippides).<ref>Lucian, III</ref> It should be noted that in some medieval codices of Herodotus the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta before the battle is given as Philippides, and this name is also preferred in a few modern editions.<ref>Lazenby, p. 52</ref>\n\nWhen the idea of a modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] became a reality at the end of the 19th century, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the ancient glory of Greece.<ref name = AIMS/> The idea of organizing a \"marathon race\" came from [[Michel Br\u00e9al]], who wanted the event to feature in the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896 in Athens. This idea was heavily supported by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as the Greeks.<ref name = \"AIMS\">{{cite web|url=http://aimsworldrunning.org/marathon_history.htm|title=Marathon History|accessdate=2008-10-15|author=AIMS}}</ref> This would echo the legendary version of events, with the competitors running from Marathon to Athens.
