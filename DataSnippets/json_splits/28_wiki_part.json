Also, balance of trade does not mean that exports and imports are \"in balance\" with each other or anything else.\n\nIf a country exports a greater value than it imports, it has a '''trade surplus''' or '''positive balance''', and conversely, if a country imports a greater value than it exports, it has a '''trade deficit''' or '''negative balance.'''

They can be either, depending on circumstances.}}</ref>\n\n==Explanation==\n[[File:Balance of trade in goods and services (Eurozone countries).png|thumb|Balance of trade in goods and services (Eurozone countries)]]\n[[File:US Trade Balance 1980 2010.svg|thumb|US Trade Balance 1980 2010]]\n[[File:U.S. Trade Balance (1895\u20132015) and Trade Policies.png|thumb|U.S. Trade Balance and Trade Policy (1895\u20132015)]]\n[[File:U.K. balance of trade in goods (since 1870).png|thumb|U.K. balance of trade in goods (since 1870)]]\nThe balance of trade forms part of the [[current account]], which includes other transactions such as income from the [[net international investment position]] as well as international aid. If the current account is in surplus, the country's net international asset position increases correspondingly. Equally, a deficit decreases the net international asset position.\n\nThe trade balance is identical to the difference between a country's output and its domestic demand (the difference between what goods a country produces and how many goods it buys from abroad; this does not include money re-spent on foreign stock, nor does it factor in the concept of importing goods to produce for the domestic market).\n\nMeasuring the balance of trade can be problematic because of problems with recording and collecting data. As an illustration of this problem, when official data for all the world's countries are added up, exports exceed imports by almost 1%; it appears the world is running a positive balance of trade with itself. This cannot be true, because all transactions involve an equal [[credit (finance)|credit]] or [[debit]] in the account of each nation. The discrepancy is widely believed to be explained by transactions intended to launder money or evade taxes, smuggling and other visibility problems. Especially for developing countries, the transaction statistics are likely to be inaccurate.\n\nFactors that can affect the balance of trade include:\n* The cost of production (land, labor, capital, taxes, incentives, etc.) in the exporting economy ''vis-\u00e0-vis'' those in the importing economy;\n* The cost and availability of raw materials, intermediate goods and other inputs;\n* Currency exchange rate movements;\n* Multilateral, bilateral and unilateral taxes or restrictions on trade;\n* Non-tariff barriers such as environmental, health or safety standards;\n* The availability of adequate foreign exchange with which to pay for imports; and\n* Prices of goods manufactured at home (influenced by the responsiveness of supply)\n\nIn addition, the trade balance is likely to differ across the [[business cycle]]. In export-led growth (such as oil and early industrial goods), the balance of trade will shift towards exports during an economic expansion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} However, with domestic demand-led growth (as in the United States and Australia) the trade balance will shift towards imports at the same stage in the business cycle.\n\nThe monetary balance of trade is different from the physical balance of trade<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6542|title=Physical Trade Balance, OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref> (which is expressed in amount of raw materials, known also as Total Material Consumption). Developed countries usually import a lot of raw materials from developing countries. Typically, these imported materials are transformed into finished products, and might be exported after adding value. Financial trade balance statistics conceal material flow. Most developed countries have a large physical trade deficit, because they consume more raw materials than they produce. Many{{who|date=May 2016}} civil society organisations claim this imbalance is predatory and campaign for [[ecological debt]] repayment.\n\n==Historical examples==\n{{See also|Foreign trade of the United States}}\nMany countries in early modern Europe adopted a policy of [[mercantilism]], which theorized that a trade surplus was beneficial to a country, among other elements such as [[colonialism]] and [[trade barrier]]s with other countries and their colonies.  ([[Bullionism]] was an early philosophy supporting mercantilism.)\n[[File:Merchandise exports (1870-1992).png|thumb|Merchandise exports (1870\u20131992)]]\n[[File:Trade policy, exports and growth in selected European countries.png|thumb|Trade policy, exports and growth in selected European countries]]\n\nThe practices and abuses of mercantilism led the natural resources and cash crops of [[British North America]] to be exported in exchange for finished goods from Great Britain, a factor leading to the [[American Revolution]].

Trade deficits generated in tradeable goods such as manufactured goods or software may impact domestic employment to different degrees than do trade deficits in raw materials.\n\nEconomies which have savings surpluses, such as Japan and Germany, typically run trade surpluses. China, a high-growth economy, has tended to run trade surpluses. A higher savings rate generally corresponds to a trade surplus. Correspondingly, the U.S. with its lower savings rate has tended to run high trade deficits, especially with Asian nations.\n\n===In 2016===\n\n{|\n|+ Balance of trade in some  geographic zones\n|-\n| {{Graph:Chart \n|width=450 |height=200 \n|type=rect\n|yAxisTitle=\u20ac Millions\n|yAxisFormat:.3s\n|xAxisTitle=Geographic zone\n|xAxisAngle=-45\n|showValues=format:.3s, fontcolor:black, offset: 8\n|x=EU28\n-c2018,Russia,Canada,USA, Mexico,Brazil,China (-HK),Japan,S Korea,India,Singapoor\n|y1=32458 ,93263 ,-12640 ,-719571,-11908 ,43078,460490,34337,80617,-87070,42336\n|y2=1745852,257919 ,351398,1312826,337774 ,167346,1895055,582647 ,447572,235185,298013,\n|y3=1713393,164655 ,364039,2032397,349683 ,124267,1434565,548309 ,366954,322255,255677,\n|colors=#c0808080,#c0ff4040,#c00036cc\n|legend=Balance of trade, Import et exports (2016)\n|y1Title=Balance of trade\n|y2Title=Exports\n|y3Title=Imports\n}}\n|-\n| Sources: Eurostat 2016<ref>http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=BOOKMARK_DS-054606_QID_73860F21_UID_-3F171EB0&layout=GEO,L,X,0;INDIC_ET,L,Y,0;TIME,C,Z,0;SITC06,L,Z,1;INDICATORS,C,Z,2;&zSelection=DS-054606SITC06,TOTAL;DS-054606INDICATORS,OBS_FLAG;DS-054606TIME,2016;&rankName1=SITC06_1_2_-1_2&rankName2=INDICATORS_1_2_-1_2&rankName3=TIME_1_0_0_0&rankName4=GEO_1_2_0_0&rankName5=INDIC-ET_1_2_0_1&rStp=&cStp=&rDCh=&cDCh=&rDM=true&cDM=true&footnes=false&empty=false&wai=false&time_mode=NONE&time_most_recent=false&lang=EN&cfo=%23%23%23%2C%23%23%23.%23%23%23</ref>{{,}}<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/International_trade_in_goods/fr</ref>\n|}\n\n==Views on economic impact==\nThe notion that bilateral trade deficits are bad in and of themselves is overwhelmingly rejected by trade experts and economists.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/06/economists-take-aim-at-trump-trade-theory-again-peter-navarro-bilateral-multilateral-trade-deals-china-germany-national-security/|title=Economists Take Aim at Trump Trade Theory \u2014 Again|last=Gramer|first=Robbie|date=March 6, 2017|work=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]|access-date=March 12, 2017|quote=Navarro\u2019s comments drew skepticism from trade experts and economists across the political spectrum, who said that line of thinking on economics was flawed.

The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by 'creating' additional 'international money', and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium.

Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Geoffrey Crowther]], then editor of [[The Economist]], \"If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.\"<ref>{{cite book|author= Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons\n|year=1948|page=336}}</ref>\n\nThese ideas were informed by events prior to the [[Great Depression]] when \u2013 in the opinion of Keynes and others \u2013 international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.<ref>{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey| title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948|pages= 368\u201372}}</ref>\n\nInfluenced by Keynes, economics texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade.

However, in more recent years, since the end of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1971, with the increasing influence of [[monetarist]] schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns \u2013 and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses \u2013 have largely disappeared from [[mainstream economics]] discourse<ref>See for example, Krugman, P and Wells, R (2006). \"Economics\", Worth Publishers</ref> and Keynes' insights have slipped from view.<ref>although see Duncan, R (2005). \"The Dollar Crisis: Causes, Consequences, Cures\", Wiley</ref> They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]].<ref>See for example,{{cite web|url= http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/11/18/clearing-up-this-mess/|title=Clearing Up This Mess| date=18 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090123161345/http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/11/18/clearing-up-this-mess/| archivedate= 23 January 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n===Monetarist theory===\nPrior to 20th century monetarist theory, the 19th century economist and philosopher [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat]] expressed the idea that trade deficits actually were a manifestation of profit, rather than a loss. He proposed as an example to suppose that he, a Frenchman, exported French wine and imported British coal, turning a profit. He supposed he was in France, and sent a cask of wine which was worth 50 francs to England. The customhouse would record an export of 50 francs. If, in England, the wine sold for 70 francs (or the pound equivalent), which he then used to buy coal, which he imported into France, and was found to be worth 90 francs in France, he would have made a profit of 40 francs. But the customhouse would say that the value of imports exceeded that of exports and was trade deficit against the ledger of France.\n\nBy ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', Bastiat argued that the national trade deficit was an indicator of a successful economy, rather than a failing one. Bastiat predicted that a successful, growing economy would result in greater trade deficits, and an unsuccessful, shrinking economy would result in lower trade deficits. This was later, in the 20th century, echoed by economist [[Milton Friedman]].\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Milton Friedman]], a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Memorial Prize]]-winning economist and a proponent of [[monetarism]], contended that some of the concerns of trade deficits are unfair criticisms in an attempt to push macroeconomic policies favorable to exporting industries.\n\nFriedman argued that trade deficits are not necessarily important, as high exports raise the value of the currency, reducing aforementioned exports, and vice versa for imports, thus naturally removing trade deficits ''not due to investment''. Since 1971, when the Nixon administration decided to abolish fixed exchange rates, America's Current Account accumulated trade deficits have totaled $7.75 trillion as of 2010. This deficit exists as it is matched by investment coming into the United States \u2013 purely by the definition of the balance of payments, any current account deficit that exists is matched by an inflow of foreign investment.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. had experienced high inflation and Friedman's policy positions tended to defend the stronger dollar at that time. He stated his belief that these trade deficits were not necessarily harmful to the economy at the time since the currency comes back to the country (country A sells to country B, country B sells to country C who buys from country A, but the trade deficit only includes A and B). However, it may be in one form or another including the possible tradeoff of foreign control of assets. In his view, the \"worst-case scenario\" of the currency never returning to the country of origin was actually the best possible outcome: the country actually purchased its goods by exchanging them for pieces of cheaply made paper. As Friedman put it, this would be the same result as if the exporting country burned the dollars it earned, never returning it to market circulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ideachannel.tv/|title=TheIdeaChannel.tv|website=www.ideachannel.tv|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis position is a more refined version of the theorem first discovered by [[David Hume]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Hume, David|title=Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary}}</ref> Hume argued that England could not permanently gain from exports, because hoarding gold (i.e., currency) would make gold more plentiful in England; therefore, the prices of English goods would rise, making them less attractive exports and making foreign goods more attractive imports. In this way, countries' trade balances would balance out.\n\nFriedman presented his analysis of the balance of trade in ''[[Free to Choose]]'', widely considered his most significant popular work.\n\n===Trade balance\u2019s effects upon a nation's GDP===\nExports directly increase and imports directly reduce a nation's balance of trade (i.e. net exports). A trade surplus is a positive net balance of trade, and a trade deficit is a negative net balance of trade. Due to the balance of trade being explicitly added to the calculation of the nation's gross domestic product using the expenditure method of calculating gross domestic product (i.e. GDP), trade surpluses are contributions and trade deficits are \"drags\" upon their nation's GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenditure-method.asp|title=Expenditure Method|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=11 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/methodologies/index.htm#national_meth|title=Bureau of Economic Analysis|first=US Department of Commerce, BEA, Bureau of Economic|last=Analysis|website=www.bea.gov|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/gross-domestic-product|title=gross domestic product - Definition & Formula|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Balance of trade vs. balance of payments==\n{{prose|date=April 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50%\" | Balance of trade !! style = \"width:50%\" | Balance of payments\n|-\n| The balance of trade includes only visible imports and exports, i.e. imports and exports of merchandise.

(1875) ''Die Entstehung Der Alpen'' [''The Origin of the Alps'']. Vienna: W. Braunmuller.</ref>\n\nWhile the concept has a geological origin, it is an indication of the effect of both [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Matthew F. Maury]] on the [[Earth sciences]]. The biosphere's ecological context comes from the 1920s (see [[Vladimir I. Vernadsky]]), preceding the 1935 introduction of the term \"[[ecosystem]]\" by Sir [[Arthur Tansley]] (see [[Ecology (history)|ecology history]]). Vernadsky defined [[ecology]] as the science of the biosphere. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] concept for integrating [[astronomy]], [[geophysics]], [[meteorology]], [[biogeography]], [[evolution]], [[geology]], [[geochemistry]], [[hydrology]] and, generally speaking, all life and Earth sciences.\n\n=== Narrow definition ===\nGeochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms (the \"[[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]\" or \"[[Biota (ecology)|biota]]\" as referred to by biologists and ecologists). In this sense, the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model, the other three being ''[[geosphere]]'', ''[[hydrosphere]]'', and ''[[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]''. When these four component spheres are combined into one system, it is known as the [[Ecosphere (planetary)|Ecosphere]].

For example, the membrane around [[peroxisome]]s shields the rest of the cell from peroxides, chemicals that can be toxic to the cell, and the cell membrane separates a cell from its surrounding medium. Peroxisomes are one form of vacuole found in the cell that contain by-products of chemical reactions within the cell. Most organelles are defined by such membranes, and are called \"membrane-bound\" organelles.\n\n===Selective permeability===\n\nProbably the most important feature of a biomembrane is that it is a selectively permeable structure. This means that the size, charge, and other chemical properties of the atoms and molecules attempting to cross it will determine whether they succeed in doing so. Selective permeability is essential for effective separation of a cell or organelle from its surroundings. Biological membranes also have certain mechanical or elastic properties that allow them to change shape and move as required.\n\nGenerally, small hydrophobic molecules can readily cross phospholipid bilayers by simple [[diffusion]].<ref>Brown</ref>\n\nParticles that are required for cellular function but are unable to diffuse freely across a membrane enter through a membrane transport protein or are taken in by means of [[endocytosis]], where the membrane allows for a vacuole to join onto it and push its contents into the cell. Many types of specialized plasma membranes can separate cell from external environment: apical, basolateral, presynaptic and postsynaptic ones, membranes of flagella, cilia, [[microvillus]], [[filopodia]] and [[lamellipodia]], the [[sarcolemma]] of muscle cells, as well as specialized myelin and [[dendritic spine]] membranes of neurons. Plasma membranes can also form different types of \"supramembrane\" structures such as [[caveolae]], postsynaptic density, [[podosome]], [[invadopodium]], desmosome, [[hemidesmosome]], focal adhesion, and cell junctions. These types of membranes differ in lipid and protein composition.\n\nDistinct types of membranes also create intracellular organelles: endosome; smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum; sarcoplasmic reticulum; Golgi apparatus; lysosome; mitochondrion (inner and outer membranes); nucleus (inner and outer membranes); [[peroxisome]]; vacuole; cytoplasmic granules; cell vesicles (phagosome, [[autophagosome]], [[clathrin]]-coated vesicles, [[COPI]]-coated and [[COPII]]-coated vesicles) and secretory vesicles (including [[synaptosome]], [[acrosome]]s, melanosomes, and chromaffin granules).\nDifferent types of biological membranes have diverse lipid and protein compositions. The content of membranes defines their physical and biological properties. Some components of membranes play a key role in medicine, such as the efflux pumps that pump drugs out of a cell.\n\n=== Fluidity ===\nThe hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer is constantly in motion because of rotations around the bonds of lipid tails.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|title = Dynamic membrane protein topological switching upon changes in phospholipid environment|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/112/45/13874|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2015-11-10|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 4653158|pmid = 26512118|pages = 13874\u201313879|volume = 112|issue = 45|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1512994112|first = Heidi|last = Vitrac|first2 = David M.|last2 = MacLean|first3 = Vasanthi|last3 = Jayaraman|first4 = Mikhail|last4 = Bogdanov|first5 = William|last5 = Dowhan}}</ref> Hydrophobic tails of a bilayer bend and lock together.

This molecule is present in especially large amounts in the plasma membrane, where it constitutes approximately 20% of the lipids in the membrane by weight. Because cholesterol molecules are short and rigid, they fill the spaces between neighboring phospholipid molecules left by the kinks in their unsaturated hydrocarbon tails. In this way, cholesterol tends to stiffen the bilayer, making it more rigid and less permeable.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Essential Cell Biology third edition|last=Alberts, Bray, Hopkin, Johnson, Lewis, Raff, Roberts, Walter|first=Bruce, Dennis, Karen, Alexander, Julian, Martin, Keith, Peter|publisher=Garland Science, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC, an informa business|year=2010|isbn=978-0815341291|location=270 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA, and 2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, OX14 4RN, UK|pages=370|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nFor all cells, membrane fluidity is important for many reasons. It enables membrane proteins to diffuse rapidly in the plane of the bilayer and to interact with one another, as is crucial, for example, in [[cell signaling]]. It permits membrane lipids and proteins to diffuse from sites where they are inserted into the bilayer after their synthesis to other regions of the cell. It allows membranes to fuse with one another and mix their molecules, and it ensures that membrane molecules are distributed evenly between daughter cells when a cell divides. If biological membranes were not fluid, it is hard to imagine how cells could live, grow, and reproduce.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Osmosis]]\n* [[Membrane biology]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;General\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |author=von Heijne G, Rees D |title=Membranes: reading between the lines |journal=Curr.

It read:\n\n{{quote|His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.}}\n\nThe declaration was contained in a letter dated 2{{nbsp}}November 1917 from the United Kingdom's [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Arthur Balfour]] to [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]], a leader of the [[British Jews|British Jewish community]], for transmission to the [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The text of the declaration was published in the press on 9{{nbsp}}November 1917.\n\nImmediately following their declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the [[British War Cabinet]] began to consider the future of Palestine; within two months [[The Future of Palestine|a memorandum was circulated to the Cabinet]] by a Zionist Cabinet member, [[Herbert_Samuel,_1st_Viscount_Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], proposing the support of Zionist ambitions in order to enlist the support of Jews in the wider war. [[De Bunsen Committee|A committee]] was established in April 1915 by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[H. H. Asquith]] to determine their policy toward the [[Ottoman Empire]] including Palestine. Asquith, who had favored post-war reform of the Ottoman Empire, resigned in December 1916; his replacement [[David Lloyd George]], favored partition of the Empire. The first negotiations between the British and the [[Zionism|Zionists]] took place at a conference on 7 February 1917 that included [[Mark Sykes|Sir Mark Sykes]] and the Zionist leadership. Subsequent discussions led to Balfour's request, on 19 June, that Rothschild and [[Chaim Weizmann]] submit a draft of a public declaration. Further drafts were discussed by the British Cabinet during September and October, with input from Zionist and [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] Jews but with no representation from the local population in Palestine. \n\nBy late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a stalemate, with two of [[Allies of World War I|Britain's allies]] not fully engaged: the United States had yet to suffer a casualty, and the Russians were in the midst of a [[October revolution|revolution]] with [[Bolsheviks]] taking over the government. A [[Stalemate in Southern Palestine|stalemate in southern Palestine]] was broken by the [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]] on 31 October 1917. The release of the final declaration was authorised on 31 October; the preceding Cabinet discussion had referenced perceived propaganda benefits amongst the worldwide Jewish community for the Allied war effort.\n\nThe opening words of the declaration represented the first public expression of support for Zionism by a major political power. The term \"national home\" had no precedent in international law, and was intentionally vague as to whether a [[Jewish state]] was contemplated. The intended boundaries of Palestine were not specified, and the British government later confirmed that the words \"in Palestine\" meant that the Jewish national home was not intended to cover all of Palestine. The second half of the declaration was added to satisfy opponents of the policy, who had claimed that it would otherwise prejudice the position of the local population of Palestine and encourage [[antisemitism]] worldwide by \"stamping the Jews as strangers in their native lands\".  The declaration called for safeguarding the civil and religious rights for the [[Palestinian Arabs]], who composed the [[Demographic history of Palestine (region)|vast majority of the local population]], and also the rights of the Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine. The British government acknowledged in 1939 that the local population's views should have been taken into account, and recognised in 2017 that the declaration should have called for protection of the Palestinian Arabs' political rights.\n\nThe declaration had many long-lasting consequences. It greatly increased popular support for [[Zionism]] within [[Jewish diaspora|Jewish communities worldwide]], and became a core component of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]], the founding document of [[Mandatory Palestine]], which later became [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]]. As a result, it is considered a principal cause of the ongoing [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], often described as the world's most intractable conflict. Controversy remains over a number of areas, such as whether the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to [[Hussein ibn Ali al-Hashimi|the Sharif of Mecca]] in the [[McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence|McMahon\u2013Hussein correspondence]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Early British support ===\n\n[[File:Memorandum to Protestant Monarchs of Europe for the restoration of the Jews to Palestine, Colonial Times 1841.jpg|thumb|Lord Shaftesbury's \"Memorandum to Protestant Monarchs of Europe for the restoration of the Jews to Palestine\", as published in the [[Colonial Times]], in 1841]]\nEarly British political support for an increased Jewish presence in the [[Palestine (region)|region of Palestine]] was based upon geopolitical calculations.{{sfn|Renton|2007|p=2}}{{efn|group=lower-roman|Renton described this as follows: \"A crucial aspect of this depiction of the Declaration as a product of British benevolence, as opposed to realpolitik, was that the British had a natural and deep-rooted concern for the rights of Jews and specifically their national restoration, which was an ingrained part of British culture and history. Presented in this way, the Declaration was shown to be a natural, almost preordained event. Hence, Zionism was presented not just as the ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' of Jewish history but also of British history. The tendency of nationalist and Zionist histories to develop towards a single point of destiny and redemption allowed for, indeed required, such an explanation. The myth of British 'proto-Zionism', which has had such a longstanding influence on the historiography of the Balfour Declaration, was thus produced, so as to serve the needs of Zionist propagandists working for the British Government.\"{{sfn|Renton|2007|p=85}}}} This support began in the early 1840s{{sfn|Sch\u00f6lch|1992|p=44}} and was led by [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], following the [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u201333)|occupation of Syria]] and [[Peasants' revolt in Palestine|Palestine]] by [[separatism|separatist]] Ottoman governor [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]].{{sfn|Stein|1961|pp=5\u20139}}{{sfn|Liebreich|2004|pp=8\u20139}} French influence had grown in Palestine and the wider Middle East, and its role as protector of the [[Catholic church|Catholic]] communities [[R\u00e8glement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|began to grow]], just as Russian influence had grown as protector of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] in the same regions.

This engendered a permanent split in the Jewish world, between those who held to a halachic or religious-centric vision of their identity and those who adopted in part the racial rhetoric of the time and made the Jewish people into a nation. This was helped along by the wave of pogroms in Eastern Europe that set two million Jews to flight; most wound up in America, but some chose Palestine. A driving force behind this was the Hovevei Zion movement, which worked from 1882 to develop a Hebrew identity that was distinct from Judaism as a religion.\"{{sfn|LeVine|Mossberg|2014|p=211}}}}{{efn|group=lower-roman|name=Gelvin2014|Gelvin wrote: \"The fact that Palestinian nationalism developed later than Zionism and indeed in response to it does not in any way diminish the legitimacy of Palestinian nationalism or make it less valid than Zionism.

As we have seen, Zionism itself arose in reaction to anti-Semitic and exclusionary nationalist movements in Europe. It would be perverse to judge Zionism as somehow less valid than European anti-Semitism or those nationalisms. Furthermore, Zionism itself was also defined by its opposition to the indigenous Palestinian inhabitants of the region.

The Roumanians had been crushed. The Russian Army was demoralized. The French Army was unable at the moment to take the offensive on a large scale. The Italians had sustained a great defeat at Caporetto. Millions of tons of British shipping had been sunk by German submarines. No American divisions were yet available in the trenches. In this critical situation it was believed that Jewish sympathy or the reverse would make a substantial difference one way or the other to the Allied cause. In particular Jewish sympathy would confirm the support of American Jewry, and would make it more difficult for Germany to reduce her military commitments and improve her economic position on the eastern front... The Zionist leaders [Mr.&nbsp;Lloyd George informed us] gave us a definite promise that, if the Allies committed themselves to giving facilities for the establishment of a national home for the Jews in Palestine, they would do their best to rally Jewish sentiment and support throughout the world to the Allied cause.

The Zionist Movement was exceptionally strong in Russia and America... It was believed, also, that such a declaration would have a potent influence upon world Jewry outside Russia, and secure for the Entente the aid of Jewish financial interests. In America, their aid in this respect would have a special value when the Allies had almost exhausted the gold and marketable securities available for American purchases. Such were the chief considerations which, in 1917, impelled the British Government towards making a contract with Jewry.\"{{sfn|Lloyd George|1939|pp=724\u2013734}}}} Lloyd George described a total of nine factors motivating his decision as Prime Minister to release the declaration,{{sfn|Gelvin|2014|p=82''ff''}} including the additional reasons that a Jewish presence in Palestine would strengthen Britain's position on the [[Suez Canal]] and reinforce the route to their imperial dominion in India.{{sfn|Gelvin|2014|p=82''ff''}}\n\nThese geopolitical calculations were debated and discussed in the following years.{{sfn|Gelvin|2014|p=82''ff''}} Historians agree that the British believed that expressing support would appeal to Jews in Germany and the United States, given two of Woodrow Wilson's closest advisors were known to be avid Zionists;{{efn|group=lower-roman|Gelvin noted that \"The British did not know quite what to make of President Woodrow Wilson and his conviction (before America's entrance into the war) that the way to end hostilities was for both sides to accept \"peace without victory.\" Two of Wilson's closest advisors, [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Felix Frankfurter]], were avid Zionists. How better to shore up an uncertain ally than by endorsing Zionist aims? The British adopted similar thinking when it came to the [[Russia]]ns, who were in the midst of their revolution. Several of the most prominent revolutionaries, including [[Leon Trotsky]], were of [[Jews|Jewish]] descent.

But behind it all was the knowledge that, if Britain promoted such a policy, it would necessarily be up to her to implement it, and this would in turn mean that she would have to exercise political control over Palestine. One aim of the Balfour Declaration was thus to freeze out France (and anyone else) from any post-war presence in Palestine.\"{{sfn|Grainger|2006|p=178}} and Barr writes: \"To ward off the inevitable French pressure for an international administration once Palestine had been conquered, the British government now made its support for Zionism public.\"{{sfn|Barr|2011|p=60}}}}\n\nSome historians argue that the British government's decision reflected what [[James L. Gelvin|James Gelvin]], Professor of Middle Eastern History at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], calls 'patrician anti-Semitism' in the overestimation of Jewish power in both the United States and Russia.{{sfn|Gelvin|2014|p=82''ff''}} American Zionism was still in its infancy; in 1914 the Zionist Federation had a small budget of about $5,000 and only 12,000 members, despite an American Jewish population of three million.{{efn|group=lower-roman|Brysac and Meyer wrote: \"As the lawyer and historian David Fromkin has shrewdly noted, out of an estimated three million Jews living in the United States in 1914, a mere twelve thousand belonged to an amateurishly led Zionist Federation, which claimed but five hundred members in New York. Its annual budget prior to 1914 never exceeded $5,200, and the largest single gift it received totalled $200.\"{{sfn|Brysac|Meyer|2009|p=115}}}} But the Zionist organizations had recently succeeded, following a show of force within the American Jewish community, in arranging a Jewish congress to debate the Jewish problem as a whole.{{efn|group=lower-roman|Reinharz described this as follows: \"At the Zionist Emergency Conference in August 1914, Poalei-Zion demanded the convening of a Jewish congress which would debate the Jewish problem as a whole... During a year of fruitless discussions, the AJC would only agree only to a limited convention of specific organizations, rather than a congress based on democratic elections. In March 1916, therefore, the Zionists invited a number of other organizations to set up a congress. The internal strife among American Jewry, which had been so widely feared, broke out in full force... The elections were held in June, two months after the United States had entered the war; 325,000 voted, 75,000 of whom were from the Zionist workers' camp. This was an impressive demonstration of the ability of the immigrant Zionists to rally massive support. Immediately after came President Wilson's suggestion to Wise not to hold the congress while the war was on, and the opening session was thus postponed from 2 September 1917, until \"peace negotiations will be in prospect\". The PZCs acceptance of the deferment again aroused the ire of supporters of the congress, who described it as a degrading surrender.\"{{sfn|Reinharz|1988|pp=131\u2013145}}}} This impacted British and French government estimates of the balance of power within the American Jewish public.{{efn|group=lower-roman|name=Reinharz2|Reinharz wrote: \"British and French estimates of the balance of power in the American Jewish public were greatly affected by this success in the struggle for a congress. It was a victory for Zionists under the leadership of close advisers to the Wilson Administration, such as Brandeis and Frankfurter, against the desires of the bankers from Wall Street, the AJC, and the National Workers' Committee. It spurred an impressive growth in organized membership: from 7,500 in 200 Zionist societies in 1914 to 30,000 in 600 societies in 1918. One year later, the number of members reached 149,000. In addition, the FAZ and the PZC collected millions of dollars during the war years. This demonstration of support for Zionism among the masses of American Jews played a vital role in the British considerations which led to the Balfour Declaration. The American Government (or, at least, the State Department), which did not particularly want to support the Declaration, did so almost in spite of itself&nbsp;\u2013 apparently because of the growing strength of Zionists in the United States.\"{{sfn|Reinharz|1988|pp=131\u2013145}}}}\n\n[[Avi Shlaim]], Emeritus Professor of International Relations in the [[University of Oxford]], asserts that two main schools of thought have been developed on the question of the primary driving force behind the declaration,{{sfn|Shlaim|2005|pp=251\u2013270}} one presented in 1961 by Leonard Stein,{{sfn|Stein|1961}} a lawyer and former political secretary to the [[World Zionist Organization]], and the other in 1970 by Mayir Veret\u00e9, then Professor of Israeli History at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Veret\u00e9|1970}} Shlaim states that Stein does not reach any clear cut conclusions, but that implicit in his narrative is that the declaration resulted primarily from the activity and skill of the Zionists, whereas according to Veret\u00e9, it was the work of hard-headed pragmatists motivated by British imperial interests in the Middle East.{{sfn|Shlaim|2005|pp=251\u2013270}} Much of modern scholarship on the decision to issue the declaration focuses on the Zionist movement and rivalries within it,{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=50\u201351}} with a key debate being whether the role of Weizmann was decisive or whether the British were likely to have issued a similar declaration in any event.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=50\u201351}} Danny Gutwein, Professor of Jewish History at the [[University of Haifa]], proposes a twist on an old idea, asserting that Sykes's February 1917 approach to the Zionists was the defining moment, and that it was consistent with the pursuit of the government's wider agenda to [[Partition of the Ottoman Empire|partition the Ottoman Empire]].{{efn|group=lower-roman|Gutwein described the impact as follows: \"Sykes's approach to the Zionist-radical leadership in early 1917 led to a major transformation in Weizmann's political standing. From the outbreak of the war until Asquith's fall, it was Weizmann who sought paths to British statesmen and officials to request their aid, but his efforts were blocked due to his radical positions. Now, it was Sykes who approached Weizmann and Sokolow and requested their assistance to advance radical aims. The co-opting of Weizmann and the Zionist-radicals into Lloyd George's administration transformed them from lobbyists into partners, and Sykes used their help to promote three major goals of the radical policy: the fight against Wilson's \"peace without victory\" policy; the establishment of \"Greater Armenia\" as a Russian protectorate that included Turkish Armenia; and the replacement of joint British-French rule in Palestine, in the spirit of the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement, with an exclusive British protectorate.\"{{sfn|Gutwein|2016|pp=117\u2013152}}}}\n\n== Long-term impact ==\n\nThe declaration had two indirect consequences, the emergence of a Jewish state and a chronic state of conflict between Arabs and Jews throughout the Middle East.{{sfn|United Nations Division for Palestinian Rights|1978|ps=: \"It ultimately led to partition and to the problem as it exists today.

Black Hand members held important army and government positions. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Crown Prince Alexander]] was an enthusiastic and financial supporter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The group held influence over government appointment and policy. The Serbian government was fairly well informed of Black Hand activities.\nFriendly relations had fairly well cooled by 1914. The Black Hand was displeased with Prime Minister [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]]. They thought he did not act aggressively enough towards the Pan-Serb cause. They engaged in a bitter power struggle over several issues, such as who would control territories Serbia annexed in the [[Balkan Wars]]. By this point, disagreeing with the Black Hand was dangerous, as political murder was one of their tools.\n\nIt was also in 1914 that Apis allegedly decided that Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir-apparent of Austria, should be assassinated, as he was trying to pacify the Serbians, and if this happened then a revolution would never occur. Towards that end it is claimed that three young Bosnian Serbs were recruited to kill the Archduke. They were definitely trained in bomb throwing and marksmanship by current and former members of the Serbian military. [[Gavrilo Princip]], [[Nedeljko \u010cabrinovi\u0107]] and [[Trifko Grabe\u017e]] were smuggled across the border back into Bosnia via a chain of [[Underground Railroad|underground-railroad]] style contacts.\nThe decision to kill the Archduke was apparently initiated by Apis, and not sanctioned by the full Executive Committee (assuming Apis was involved at all, a question that remains in dispute<ref>Vladimer Dedijer, ''The Road to Sarajevo''</ref>). Those involved probably realized that their plot would result in war between Austria and Serbia, and had every reason to expect that Russia would side with Serbia. They likely did not, however, anticipate that the assassination would start a chain of events leading to World War I.\nOthers in the government and some of the Black Hand Executive Council were not as confident of Russian aid. Russia had let them down recently. When word of the plot allegedly percolated through Black Hand leadership and the Serbian government (the Prime Minister Pa\u0161i\u0107 was definitely informed of two armed men being smuggled across the border; it is not clear if Pa\u0161i\u0107 knew the planned assassination), Apis was supposedly told not to proceed. He may have made a half-hearted attempt to intercept the young assassins at the border, but they had already crossed. Other sources say the attempted 'recall' was only begun after the assassins had reached Sarajevo. This 'recall' appears to make Apis look like a loose cannon, and the young assassins as independent zealots. In fact, the 'recall' took place a full two weeks before the Archduke's visit. The assassins idled around in [[Sarajevo]] for a month. Nothing more was done to stop them.\n\n==Ideology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\nThe group encompassed a range of ideological outlooks, from conspiratorially-minded army officers to idealistic youths, sometimes tending towards republicanism, despite the acquisition of nationalistic royal circles in its activities (the movement's leader, Colonel [[Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107]] or \"Apis,\" had been instrumental in the [[May Overthrow|June 1903 coup]] which had brought King [[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] to the [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian throne]] following 45 years of rule by the rival [[Obrenovic|Obrenovi\u0107]] dynasty). The group was denounced as [[nihilism|nihilist]] by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] press and compared to the Russian [[People's Will]] and the [[Chinese Assassination Corps]].\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1938 a [[Konspiracija (secret society)|conspiracy group]] to overthrow the [[Yugoslav regency]] was founded by, among others, members of the [[Serbian Cultural Club]] (SKK).{{sfn|Kazimirovi\u0107|1995|p=653}} The organization was modeled after the Black Hand, including the recruitment process.{{sfn|Kazimirovi\u0107|1995|p=654}} Two members of the Black Hand, Antonije Anti\u0107, and Velimir Vemi\u0107 were the organization's military advisors.{{sfn|Ze\u010devi\u0107|2003|p=335}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Serbian Chetnik Organization]]\n*[[Young Bosnia]]\n*[[Serb revolutionary organizations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite news|last=Anti\u0107|first=Antonije|date=2010-11-20|title=\u0160kola gnezdo zavere|newspaper=Novosti|url=http://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:308440-Skola-gnezdo-zavere|ref={{harvid|Anti\u0107|2010-11-20}} }}\n* {{cite book|last=Apis|first=Dragutin T.

Such a board's powers, duties, and responsibilities are determined by government [[regulations]] (including the jurisdiction's [[corporations law]]) and the organization's own [[constitution]] and [[bylaws]]. These authorities may specify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and how often they are to meet.\n\nIn an organization with voting members, the board is accountable to, and might be subordinate to, the organization's full membership, which usually vote for the members of the board. In a [[stock corporation]], non-executive directors are voted for by the [[shareholder]]s and the board is the highest [[authority]] in the management of the corporation. The board of directors appoints the [[chief executive officer]] of the corporation and sets out the overall strategic direction. In corporations with dispersed ownership, the identification and nomination of directors (that shareholders vote for or against) are often done by the board itself, leading to a high degree of self-perpetuation. In a [[non-stock corporation]] with no general voting membership, the board is the supreme governing body of the institution;{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=9}} its members are sometimes chosen by the board itself.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.scc.virginia.gov/clk/befaq/vanon.aspx#a4 | title = How are the directors selected? | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Commonwealth of Virginia, State Corporation Commission, Business FAQs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/Stat0181.pdf | title = Chapter 181, Nonstock Corporations (Sect. 181.0804) | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Wisconsin Statutes Database }}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nOther names include '''board of directors and advisors''', '''[[board of governors]]''', '''board of managers''', '''[[Board of Regents|board of regents]]''', '''board of [[trustees]]''', or '''board of visitors'''.

For [[public corporations|companies with publicly trading stock]], these responsibilities are typically much more rigorous and complex than for those of other types.\n\nTypically, the board chooses one of its members to be the ''[[chairman]]'' (often now called the \"chair\" or \"chairperson\"), who holds whatever title is specified in the [[by-law]]s or [[articles of association]]. However, in membership organizations, the members elect the president of the organization and the president becomes the board chair, unless the by-laws say otherwise.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}}\n\n==Directors==\nThe directors of an organization are the persons who are members of its board. Several specific terms categorize directors by the presence or absence of their other relationships to the organization.<ref>This section was developed from numerous definitions in [http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/inside-director/ USLegal.com], [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html BusinessDictionary.com], [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/executive+director Dictionary.com], The Free Dictionary by Farlex ([http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Inside+Director \"inside director\"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/executive+director \"executive director\"]; [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/outside+director \"outside director\"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonexecutive+director \"nonexecutive director\"]), [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/executive-director Macmillan Dictionary], and  [http://www.economics-dictionary.com/definition/non-executive-director.html Economics-dictionary.com]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref>\n\n===Inside director===\nAn inside director is a director who is also an employee, officer, chief executive, major [[shareholder]], or someone similarly connected to the organization. Inside directors represent the interests of the entity's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], and often have special knowledge of its inner workings, its financial or market position, and so on.\n\nTypical inside directors are:\n* A [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) who may also be [[Chairman|chairman of the board]]\n* Other executives of the organization, such as its [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) or [[executive vice president]]\n* Large shareholders (who may or may not also be employees or officers)\n* Representatives of other stakeholders such as labor unions, major lenders, or members of the community in which the organization is located\n\nAn inside director who is employed as a manager or executive of the organization is sometimes referred to as an executive director (not to be confused with the title [[executive director]] sometimes used for the CEO position in some organizations). Executive directors often have a specified area of responsibility in the organization, such as finance, marketing, human resources, or production.<ref name=Ivestopedia>{{cite web|title=Executive Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executive-director.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Outside director===\n{{Main|Independent director}}\n\nAn outside director is a member of the board who is not otherwise employed by or engaged with the organization, and does not represent any of its stakeholders. A typical example is a director who is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of a firm in a different industry.<ref name=\"Investopedia 2\">{{cite web|title=Outside Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsidedirector.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> Outside directors are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way.\n\nOutside directors bring outside experience and perspectives to the board. For example, for a company that only serves a domestic market, the presence of CEOs from global multinational corporations as outside directors can help to provide insights on export and import opportunities and international trade options. One of the arguments for having outside directors is that they can keep a watchful eye on the inside directors and on the way the organization is run. Outside directors are unlikely to tolerate \"insider dealing\" between insider directors, as outside directors do not benefit from the company or organization. Outside directors are often useful in handling disputes between inside directors, or between shareholders and the board. They are thought to be advantageous because they can be objective and present little risk of conflict of interest. On the other hand, they might lack familiarity with the specific issues connected to the organization's governance and they might not know about the industry or sector in which the organization is operating.\n\n===Terminology {{anchor|Classification}}===\n*'''Director''' \u2013 a person appointed to serve on the board of an organization, such as an institution or business.\n*'''Inside director''' \u2013 a director who, in addition to serving on the board, has a meaningful connection to the organization\n*'''[[Outside director]]''' \u2013 a director who, other than serving on the board, has no meaningful connections to the organization\n*'''Executive director''' \u2013 an inside director who is also an executive with the organization.

For example, the nature of the business entity may be one that is traded on a public market (public company), not traded on a public market (a private, limited or closely held company), owned by family members (a family business), or exempt from income taxes (a non-profit, not for profit, or tax-exempt entity). There are numerous types of business entities available throughout the world such as a corporation, limited liability company, cooperative, business trust, partnership, private limited company, and public limited company.\n\nMuch of what has been written about boards of directors relates to boards of directors of business entities actively traded on public markets.<ref>See generally, Bowen, William G., The board book: an insider's guide for directors and trustees (2008 W.W. Norton & Co.); Murray, Alan S., Revolt in the boardroom: the new rules of power in corporate America (2007 Collins); Charan, Ram, Boards that deliver: advancing corporate governance from compliance to competitive advantage (2005 Jossey-Bass); Carver, John, Corporate boards that create value: governing company performance from the boardroom (2002 Jossey-Bass); Harvard Business Review on corporate governance (2000 Harvard Business School Press).</ref> More recently, however, material is becoming available for boards of private and closely held businesses including family businesses.<ref>See specifically Tutelman and Hause, The Balance Point: New Ways Business Owners Can Use Boards (2008 Famille Press).</ref>\n\nA [[board-only]] organization is one whose board is self-appointed, rather than being accountable to a base of members through elections; or in which the powers of the membership are extremely limited.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Membership organizations===\nIn [[Voluntary association|membership organizations]], such as a society made up of members of a certain profession or one advocating a certain cause, a board of directors may have the responsibility of running the organization in between meetings of the membership, especially if the membership meets infrequently, such as only at an [[annual general meeting]].{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481\u2013483}} The amount of powers and authority delegated to the board depend on the bylaws and rules of the particular organization. Some organizations place matters exclusively in the board's control while in others, the general membership retains full power and the board can only make recommendations.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481-483}}\n\nThe setup of a board of directors vary widely across organizations and may include provisions that are applicable to corporations, in which the \"shareholders\" are the members of the organization. A difference may be that the membership elects the officers of the organization, such as the president and the secretary, and the officers become members of the board in addition to the directors and retain those duties on the board.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}} The directors may also be classified as officers in this situation.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=572}} There may also be ex-officio members of the board, or persons who are members due to another position that they hold.

In this capacity they establish policies and make decisions on issues such as whether there is [[dividend]] and how much it is, [[Employee stock option|stock options]] distributed to employees, and the hiring/firing and [[Executive pay|compensation of upper management]].\n\n===Governance===\nTheoretically, the control of a company is divided between two bodies: the board of directors, and the [[shareholder]]s in [[general meeting]]. In practice, the amount of power exercised by the board varies with the type of company. In small private companies, the directors and the shareholders are normally the same people, and thus there is no real division of power. In large [[public company|public companies]], the board tends to exercise more of a supervisory role, and individual responsibility and management tends to be delegated downward to individual professional executives (such as a finance director or a marketing director) who deal with particular areas of the company's affairs.<ref name=CRI>[http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php Titles Associated with Executive Compensation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917083738/http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php |date=17 September 2012 }}| Compensation Resources Inc.</ref>\n\nAnother feature of boards of directors in large public companies is that the board tends to have more ''[[de facto]]'' power. Many shareholders grant proxies to the directors to vote their shares at general meetings and accept all recommendations of the board rather than try to get involved in management, since each shareholder's power, as well as interest and information is so small.  Larger institutional investors also grant the board proxies. The large number of shareholders also makes it hard for them to organize. However, there have been moves recently to try to increase [[shareholder activism]] among both institutional investors and individuals with small shareholdings.<ref name=CRI/>\n\nA contrasting view is that in large public companies it is upper management and not boards that wield practical power, because boards delegate nearly all of their power to the top executive employees, adopting their recommendations almost without fail.  As a practical matter, executives even choose the directors, with shareholders normally following management recommendations and voting for them.\n\nIn most cases, serving on a board is not a [[career]] unto itself. For major corporations, the board members are usually professionals or leaders in their field. In the case of outside directors, they are often senior leaders of other organizations. Nevertheless, board members often receive remunerations amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they often sit on the boards of several companies. Inside directors are usually not paid for sitting on a board, but the duty is instead considered part of their larger job description. Outside directors are usually paid for their services. These remunerations vary between corporations, but usually consist of a yearly or monthly salary, additional compensation for each meeting attended, stock options, and various other benefits. such as travel, hotel and meal expenses for the board meetings. [[Tiffany & Co.]], for example, pays directors an annual retainer of $46,500, an additional annual retainer of $2,500 if the director is also a chairperson of a committee, a per-meeting-attended fee of $2,000 for meetings attended in person, a $500 fee for each meeting attended via telephone, in addition to stock options and retirement benefits.<ref>[http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/a/aa2203a_2.htm Fees, CEO Evaluation, and Ownership Structure]  By Joshua Kennon, About.com</ref>\n\n===Two-tier system===\nIn some European and [[Asia]]n countries, there are two separate boards, an executive board for day-to-day business and a [[supervisory board]] (elected by the shareholders and employees) for supervising the executive board. In these countries, the CEO (chief executive or managing director) presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board and allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a [[conflict of interest]] and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] from the management [[civil service]]. In the United States, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee (operating committee or executive council), composed of the CEO and their direct reports (other C-level officers, division/subsidiary heads).\n\n===History===\n[[File:DirectiekamerVOC.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The [[meeting room]] of the {{ill|Heren XVII|nl}}, the [[Dutch East India Company]]'s board of directors, in the [[Oost-Indisch Huis]] (Amsterdam).

Until the end of the 19th century, it seems to have been generally assumed that the general meeting (of all shareholders) was the supreme organ of a company, and that the board of directors merely acted as an agent of the company subject to the control of the shareholders in general meeting.<ref>Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.), citing ''[[Isle of Wight Rly Co v Tahourdin]]'' (1884) LR 25 Ch D 320</ref>\n\nHowever, by 1906, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] had made it clear in the decision of ''[[Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame]]'' [1906] 2 Ch 34 that the division of powers between the board and the shareholders in general meaning depended on the construction of the [[Articles of Association (law)|articles of association]] and that, where the powers of management were vested in the board, the general meeting could not interfere with their lawful exercise. The articles were held to constitute a contract by which the members had agreed that \"the directors and the directors alone shall manage.\"<ref>''Per'' Cozens-Hardy LJ at 44</ref>\n\nThe new approach did not secure immediate approval, but it was endorsed by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Quin & Axtens v Salmon'' [1909] AC 442 and has since received general acceptance. Under English law, successive versions of [[Table A]] have reinforced the norm that, unless the directors are acting contrary to the law or the provisions of the Articles, the powers of conducting the management and affairs of the company are vested in them.\n\nThe modern doctrine was expressed in ''[[John Shaw & Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw]]'' [1935] 2 KB 113 by [[Frederick Greer, 1st Baron Fairfield|Greer LJ]] as follows:\n\n<blockquote>A company is an entity distinct alike from its shareholders and its directors. Some of its powers may, according to its articles, be exercised by directors, certain other powers may be reserved for the shareholders in general meeting. If powers of management are vested in the directors, they and they alone can exercise these powers. The only way in which the general body of shareholders can control the exercise of powers by the articles in the directors is by altering the articles, or, if opportunity arises under the articles, by refusing to re-elect the directors of whose actions they disapprove. They cannot themselves usurp the powers which by the articles are vested in the directors any more than the directors can usurp the powers vested by the articles in the general body of shareholders.\n</blockquote>\n\nIt has been remarked{{by whom|date=April 2016}} that this development in the law was somewhat surprising at the time, as the relevant provisions in [[Table A]] (as it was then) seemed to contradict this approach rather than to endorse it.<ref>\nSee Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.) at 185.\n</ref>\n\n=== Election and removal ===\n\n{{Globalise/US | section|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn most legal systems, the appointment and removal of directors is voted upon by the shareholders in general meeting{{efn|For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 303 of the Companies Act 1985.}} or through a [[proxy statement]].

In some legal systems, directors may also be removed by a resolution of the remaining directors (in some countries they may only do so \"with cause\"; in others the power is unrestricted).\n\nSome jurisdictions also permit the board of directors to appoint directors, either to fill a vacancy which arises on resignation or death, or as an addition to the existing directors.(''needs citation'')\n\nIn practice, it can be quite difficult to remove a director by a resolution in general meeting. In many legal systems, the director has a right to receive special notice of any resolution to remove him or her;{{efn|In the United Kingdom it is 28 days' notice, see sections 303(2) and 379 of the Companies Act 1985.}} the company must often supply a copy of the proposal to the director, who is usually entitled to be heard by the meeting.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 304(1) of the Companies Act 1985.

Also, directors received fewer votes when they did not regularly attend board meetings or received negative recommendations from a proxy advisory firm. The study also shows that companies often improve their corporate governance by removing [[poison pill]]s or classified boards and by reducing excessive CEO pay after their directors receive low shareholder support.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cai | first1 = J. | last2 = Garner | first2 = J.

In 2010, the ''New York Times'' noted that several directors who had overseen companies which had failed in the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]] had found new positions as directors.<ref>Craig S, Lattman P.

Law360.</ref>\n\n===Exercise of powers===\nThe exercise by the board of directors of its powers usually occurs in board meetings. Most legal systems require sufficient notice to be given to all directors of these meetings, and that a [[quorum]] must be present before any business may be conducted. Usually, a meeting which is held without notice having been given is still valid if all of the directors attend, but it has been held that a failure to give notice may negate resolutions passed at a meeting, because the persuasive oratory of a minority of directors might have persuaded the majority to change their minds and vote otherwise.<ref>See for example ''Barber's Case'' (1877) 5 Ch D 963 and ''Re Portuguese Consolidated Copper Mines'' (1889) 42 Ch D 160</ref>\n\nIn most [[common law]] countries, the powers of the board are vested in the board as a whole, and not in the individual directors.<ref>''[[Breckland Group Holdings Ltd v London and Suffolk Properties]]'' [1989] BCLC 100</ref> However, in instances an individual director may still bind the company by his acts by virtue of his [[ostensible authority]] (see also: [[Royal British Bank v Turquand|the rule in ''Turquand's Case'']]).\n\n===Duties===<!-- This section is linked from [[Corporate benefit]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\n{{main|Directors' duties|Fiduciary duties}}\n\nBecause directors exercise control and management over the organization, but organizations are (in theory) run for the benefit of the [[shareholder]]s, the law imposes strict duties on directors in relation to the exercise of their duties. The duties imposed on directors are [[fiduciary]] duties, similar to those that the law imposes on those in similar positions of trust: [[agency (law)|agents]] and [[trustee]]s.\n\nThe duties apply to each director separately, while the powers apply to the board jointly. Also, the duties are owed to the company itself, and not to any other entity.<ref>''Percival v Wright'' [1902] Ch 421</ref> This does not mean that directors can never stand in a fiduciary relationship to the individual shareholders; they may well have such a duty in certain circumstances.<ref>For example, if the board is authorised by the shareholders to negotiate with a takeover bidder. It has been held in New Zealand that \"depending upon all the surround circumstances and the nature of the responsibility which in a real and practical sense the director has assumed towards the shareholder,\" ''Coleman v Myers'' [1977] 2 NZLR 225</ref>\n\n==== \"Proper purpose\" ====\nDirectors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose. While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith. Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper.\n\nThe seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the [[United Kingdom Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision in {{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc]] |court=UKSC |division=|year=2015 |num=71 |date={{date|2015-12-02}} }}.  The case concerned the powers of directors under the [[articles of association]] of the company to disenfranchise voting rights attached to shares for failure to properly comply with notice served on the shareholders.  Prior to that case the leading authority was ''[[Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Ltd]]'' [1974] AC 821. The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new [[stock|shares]].<ref>Following ''[[Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd]]'' [1967] Ch 254</ref> It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. An argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital was rejected as too narrow, and it was held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.<ref>''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288</ref> If so, the mere fact that an incidental result (even if it was a desired consequence) was that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated, this would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.\n\nNot all jurisdictions recognised the \"proper purpose\" duty as separate from the \"good faith\" duty however.{{efn|This division was rejected in British Columbia in ''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288.}}\n\n==== \"Unfettered discretion\" ====\nDirectors cannot, without the consent of the company, fetter their [[discretion]] in relation to the exercise of their powers, and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings.{{efn|Although as Gower points out, as well understood as the rule is, there is a paucity of authority on the point. But see ''Clark v Workman'' [1920] 1 Ir R 107 and ''Dawson International plc v Coats Paton plc'' 1989 SLT 655.}} This is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose, and no personal advantage to the director.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract which binds the company to a certain course, even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval. The company remains bound, but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions (although that may involve a breach by the company of the [[contract]] that the board previously approved).\n\n====\"Conflict of duty and interest\"====\n\nAs fiduciaries, the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company. The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.\n\n=====Transactions with the company=====\n\nBy definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the [[conflict of interest]] or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In ''Aberdeen Ry v Blaikie'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that:\n\n:\"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into...\" (''emphasis'' added)\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle can be overridden in the company's constitution.\n\nIn many countries, there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions, and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 317 of the Companies Act 1985.}}\n\n===== Use of corporate property, opportunity, or information =====\nDirectors must not, without the informed consent of the company, use for their own profit the company's assets, [[corporate opportunity|opportunities]], or information. This prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company, and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success.\n\nIn ''[[Regal (Hastings) v Gulliver|Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378 the House of Lords, in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders,{{efn|In summary, the facts were as follows: Company A owned a cinema, and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas with a view to selling the entire undertaking as a [[going concern]]. They formed a new company (\"Company B\") to take the leases of the two new cinemas. But the lessor insisted on various stipulations, one of which was that Company B had to have a paid up [[share capital]] of not less than \u00a35,000 (a substantial sum at the time). Company A was unable to subscribe for more than \u00a32,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends. Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit. The shareholders of Company A sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their 3,000 shares in Company B \u2013 the very same shares which the shareholders in Company A had been asked to subscribe (through Company A) but refused to do so.}} held that:\n\n: \"(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in profit to themselves.\"\n\nAnd accordingly, the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made, and the shareholders received their windfall.\n\nThe decision has been followed in several subsequent cases,<ref>''Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley'' [1972] 1 WLR 443 (corporate information), ''[[Canadian Aero Service v. O'Malley]]'' (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (corporate opportunity) and ''Boardman v Phipps'' [1967] 2 AC 46 (corporate opportunity, which again, the company itself had declined to take up)</ref> and is now regarded as settled law.\n\n===== Competing with the company =====\nDirectors cannot compete directly with the company without a conflict of interest arising. Similarly, they should not act as directors of competing companies, as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other.\n\n==== Common law duties of care and skill ====\nTraditionally, the level of care and skill which has to be demonstrated by a director has been framed largely with reference to the non-executive director. In ''[[Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co]]'' [1925] Ch 407, it was expressed in purely subjective terms, where the court held that:\n\n: \"a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of ''his'' knowledge and experience.\" (''emphasis'' added)\n\nHowever, this decision was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain.\n\nHowever, a more modern approach has since developed, and in ''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498 the court held that the rule in ''Equitable Fire'' related only to skill, and not to diligence. With respect to diligence, what was required was:\n\n: \"such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf.\"\n\nThis was a dual subjective and objective test, and one deliberately pitched at a higher level.\n\nMore recently, it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively; in the United Kingdom, the statutory provisions relating to directors' duties in the new [[Companies Act 2006]] have been codified on this basis.<ref name=\"NormanGoddard\">''Norman v [[Theodore Goddard]]'' [1991] BCLC 1027</ref>\n\n==== Remedies for breach of duty ====\nIn most jurisdictions, the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties:\n# [[injunction]] or [[declaration (law)|declaration]]\n# [[damages]] or compensation\n# restoration of the company's property\n# [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of the relevant [[contract]]\n# [[account of profits]]\n# [[Termination of employment#Summary termination|summary dismissal]]\n\n====Current trends====\nHistorically, directors' duties have been owed almost exclusively to the company and its members, and the board was expected to exercise its powers for the [[corporate benefit|financial benefit]] of the company. However, more recently there have been attempts to \"soften\" the position, and provide for more scope for directors to act as good corporate citizens. For example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Companies Act 2006]] requires directors of companies \"to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole\" and sets out the following six factors regarding a director's duty to promote success:\n* the likely consequences of any decision in the long term\n* the interests of the company's employees\n* the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others\n* the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment\n* the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and\n* the need to act fairly as between members of a company\n\nThis represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors' duties are owed only to the company. Previously in the United Kingdom, under the [[Companies Act 1985]], protections for non-member stakeholders were considerably more limited (see for example, s.309 which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but which could only be enforced by the shareholders and not by the employees themselves). The changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism.<ref>[http://www.altassets.net/features/arc/2006/nz8451.php Director's duties]</ref>\n\n====The Board and Society====\n\nMost companies have weak mechanisms for bringing the voice of society into the board room. They rely on personalities who weren't appointed for their understanding of societal issues. Often they give limited focus (both through time and financial resource) to issues of corporate responsibility and sustainability. A Social Board <ref>Acre Resources LTD (2018), [https://www.acre.com/resources/the-case-for-a-social-board/ The Case for a Social Board], London, UK</ref> has society designed into its structure. It elevates the voice of society through specialist appointments to the board and mechanisms that empower innovation from within the organisation. Social Boards align themselves with themes that are important to society.These may include measuring worker pay ratios, linking personal social and environmental objectives to remuneration, integrated reporting, fair tax and B-Corp Certification. \n\nSocial Boards recognise that they are part of society and that they require more than a licence to operate to succeed.They balance short-term shareholder pressure against long-term value creation, managing the business for a plurality of stakeholders including employees, shareholders, supply chains and civil society.\n\n===United States===\n\n====Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act====\n\nThe [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] of 2002 has introduced new standards of accountability on boards of U.S. companies or companies listed on U.S. [[stock exchange]]s. Under the Act, directors risk large fines and prison sentences in the case of accounting crimes. [[Internal control]] is now the direct responsibility of directors.

Four Balkan states defeated the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the first war; one of the four, Bulgaria, suffered defeat in the second war. The Ottoman Empire lost the bulk of its territory in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Clark|2013|pp=45, 559}} The war set the stage for the [[July Crisis|Balkan crisis of 1914]] and thus served as a \"prelude to the [[First World War]]\".{{sfn|Hall|2000}}\n\nBy the early 20th century, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] had achieved independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule. In 1912 these countries formed the [[Balkan League]]. The First Balkan War had three main causes:{{sfn|Helmreich|1938}}{{sfn|Hall|2000}}\n\n# The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself, govern satisfactorily, or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples.\n# The [[Great Power]]s quarreled amongst themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms. This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution.\n# Most importantly, the Balkan League had been formed, and its members were confident that it could defeat the Turks.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire lost all its European territories to the west of the River [[Maritsa]] as a result of the two Balkan Wars, which thus delineated present-day Turkey's western border. A large influx of Turks started to flee into the [[Anatolia|Ottoman heartland]] from the lost lands. By 1914, the remaining core region of the Ottoman Empire had experienced a population increase of around 2.5 million because of the flood of immigration from the Balkans.\n\nCitizens of Turkey regard the Balkan Wars as a major disaster (''Balkan harbi facias\u0131'') in the [[Ottoman Empire#Defeat and dissolution (1908\u20131922)|nation's history]]. The unexpected fall and sudden relinquishing of Turkish-dominated European territories created a [[Psychological trauma|psycho-traumatic]] event amongst many Turks that is said{{by whom|date=December 2015}} to have triggered the ultimate [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|collapse]] of the empire itself within five years. [[Naz\u0131m Pasha]], Chief of Staff of the [[Ottoman Army]], was held responsible for the failure and was assassinated on 23 January 1913 during the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'\u00e9tat]].<ref>Gul Tokay. \"Ottoman diplomacy, the Balkan Wars and the Great Powers\".

The [[Second Balkan War]] began on 16 June 1913. Both Serbia and Greece, utilizing the argument that the war had been prolonged, repudiated important particulars of the pre-war treaty and retained occupation of all the conquered districts in their possession, which were to be divided according to specific predefined boundaries. Seeing the treaty as trampled, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] (made in secret by its former allies, Serbia and Greece) and commenced military action against them. The more numerous combined Serbian and Greek armies repelled the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked into [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] from the west and the south. [[Romania]], having taken no part in the conflict, had intact armies to strike with, invaded Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty between the two states. The Ottoman Empire also attacked Bulgaria and advanced in Thrace regaining [[Adrianople]]. In the resulting [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], Bulgaria lost most of the territories it had gained in the First Balkan War in addition to being forced to cede the ex-Ottoman south-third of [[Dobruja|Dobroudja province]] to [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Winston Churchill|title=[[The World Crisis]], 1911\u20131918|year=1931|publisher=Thornton Butterworth|p=278}}</ref>\n[[File:Map-of-Ottoman-Empire-1900.png|thumb|left|Map of the Ottoman Empire in 1900, with the names of the [[Vilayet|Ottoman provinces]].]]\n\n[[File:Balkan troubles1.jpg|thumb|Germany, France, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Britain attempting to keep the lid on the simmering cauldron of imperialist and nationalist tensions in the Balkans to prevent a general European war.

Serbia had gained substantial territory during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878]], while Greece acquired [[Thessaly]] in 1881 (although [[Treaty of Constantinople (1897)|it lost a small area]] back to the Ottoman Empire in 1897) and Bulgaria (an autonomous [[principality]] since 1878) incorporated the formerly distinct province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] (1885). All three countries, as well as Montenegro, sought additional territories within the large Ottoman-ruled region known as [[Rumelia]], comprising Eastern Rumelia, [[Albania]], Macedonia, and [[Thrace]].\n\n===Policies of the Great Powers===\nThroughout the 19th century, the [[Great Power]]s shared different aims over the \"[[Eastern Question]]\" and the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. [[Russia]] wanted access to the \"warm waters\" of the [[Mediterranean]] from the Black Sea; it pursued a [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavic]] foreign policy and therefore supported Bulgaria and Serbia. Britain wished to deny Russia access to the \"warm waters\" and supported the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, although it also supported a limited expansion of [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] as a backup plan in case integrity of the Empire was no longer possible. France wished to strengthen its position in the region, especially in the [[Levant]] (today's [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], the [[Palestinian territories]] and [[Israel]]).\n\n[[Habsburg]]-ruled [[Austria-Hungary]] wished for a continuation of the existence of the Ottoman Empire, since both were troubled multinational entities and thus the collapse of the one might weaken the other. The Habsburgs also saw a strong Ottoman presence in the area as a counterweight to the Serbian nationalistic call to their own Serb subjects in [[Bosnia]], Vojvodina and other parts of the empire. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], primary aim at the time seems to have been the denial of access to the [[Adriatic Sea]] to another major sea power. [[The German Empire]], in turn, under the \"[[Drang nach Osten]]\" policy, aspired to turn the Ottoman Empire into its own de facto colony, and thus supported its integrity.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Bulgaria and Greece contended for Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace. Ethnic Greeks sought the forced \"Hellenization\" of ethnic Bulgars, who sought \"Bulgarization\" of Greeks ([[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire#Bulgarians|Rise of nationalism]]). Both nations sent armed irregulars into Ottoman territory to protect and assist their ethnic kindred. From 1904, there was low intensity warfare in Macedonia between the Greek and Bulgarian bands and the Ottoman army (the [[Struggle for Macedonia]]). After the [[Young Turks|Young Turk revolution]] of July 1908, the situation changed drastically.\n\n===Young Turk Revolution===\n{{Main article|Young Turk Revolution}}\nThe 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] saw the reinstatement of constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire and the start of the [[Second Constitutional Era]]. When the revolt broke out, it was supported by intellectuals, the army, and almost all the ethnic minorities of the Empire, and forced Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to re-adopt the long defunct [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] and [[Ottoman parliament|parliament]]. Hopes were raised among the Balkan ethnicities of reforms and autonomy, and elections were held to form a representative, multi-ethnic, Ottoman parliament. However, following the Sultan's [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|attempted counter-coup]], the liberal element of the Young Turks was sidelined and the nationalist element became dominant.\n\nAt the same time, in October 1908, Austria-Hungary seized the opportunity of the Ottoman political upheaval to annex the ''de jure'' Ottoman province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it had occupied since 1878 (see ''[[Bosnian Crisis]]''). Bulgaria declared independence as it had done in 1878, but this time the independence was internationally recognised. The Greeks of the autonomous [[Cretan State]] proclaimed unification with Greece, though the opposition of the Great Powers prevented the latter action from taking practical effect. It has large influence in the consequent world order.\n\n===Reaction in the Balkan States===\n\nSerbia was frustrated in the north by Austria-Hungary's incorporation of Bosnia. In March 1909, Serbia was forced to accept the annexation and restrain anti-Habsburg agitation by Serbian nationalists. Instead, the Serbian government (PM: [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]]) looked to formerly Serb territories in the south, notably \"Old Serbia\" (the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] and the province of [[Kosovo]]).\n\nOn 15 August 1909, the [[Military League]], a group of Greek officers, took action against the government to reform their country's national government and reorganize the army. The Military League found itself unable to create a new political system, until the League summoned the Cretan politician [[Eleutherios Venizelos]] to Athens as its political adviser. Venizelos persuaded king [[George I of Greece#Later reign and assassination|George I]] to revise the constitution and asked the League to disband in favor of a National Assembly. In March 1910, the Military League dissolved itself.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9052680 \"Military League\"], Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online</ref>\n\nBulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of her independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia,<ref name=\"Congress\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/12.htm|title = THE BALKAN WARS|publisher=[[US Library of Congress]]| accessdate =15 April 2008 |quote=}}</ref> also looked to annex districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia. In August 1910, Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom.\n\n===Balkan League===\n{{Main article|Balkan League}}\n[[File:Bulgarian army adrinople.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bulgarian forces waiting to start their assault on [[Adrianople]]]]\n\nFollowing Italy's victory in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911\u20131912, the Young Turks fell from power after a coup. The Balkan countries saw this as an opportunity to attack the Ottoman Empire and fulfill their desires of expansion.\n\nWith the initial encouragement of Russian agents, a series of agreements was concluded between Serbia and Bulgaria in March 1912. Military victory against the Ottoman Empire would not be possible while it could bring reinforcements from Asia. The condition of the Ottoman railways of the time was not advanced, so most reinforcements would have to come by sea through the [[Aegean Sea]]. Greece was the only Balkan country with a navy powerful enough to deny use of the Aegean to the Ottoman Empire, thus a treaty between Greece and Bulgaria became necessary; it was signed in May 1912.\n\nMontenegro concluded agreements between Serbia and Bulgaria later that year. Bulgaria signed treaties with Serbia to divide the territory of northern Macedonia.\n\nThis alliance between Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro became known as the Balkan League; its existence was undesirable for all the Great Powers. The League was loose at best, though secret liaison officers were exchanged between the Greek and the Serbian army after the war began. Greece delayed the start of the war several times in the summer of 1912, to better prepare her navy, but Montenegro declared war on 8 October (25 September [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]). Following an ultimatum to the Ottoman Empire, the remaining members of the alliance entered the conflict on 17 October.\n\n==First Balkan War==\n{{Main article|First Balkan War}}\n[[File:Balkan belligerants 1914.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Territorial changes as a result of the First Balkan war, as of April 1913 showing the prewar agreed line of expansion between [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]]]\n[[File:King George I of Greece and Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria at Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The apple of discord: King [[George I of Greece]] and Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] at Thessaloniki, December 1912. Despite their alliance, Greco-Bulgarian antagonism over the city and Macedonia in general did not abate.]]\n\nThe three Slavic allies (Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro) had laid out extensive plans to coordinate their war efforts, in continuation of their secret prewar settlements and under close Russian supervision (Greece was not included). Serbia and Montenegro would attack in the theater of Sandjak, Bulgaria and Serbia in Macedonia and Thrace.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire's situation was difficult. Its population of about 26 million people provided a massive pool of manpower, but three quarters of the population and nearly all of [[Islam in the Ottoman Empire|the Muslim component]] lived in the Asian part of the Empire. Reinforcements had to come from Asia mainly by sea, which depended on the result of battles between the Turkish and Greek navies in the Aegean.\n\nWith the outbreak of the war, the Ottoman Empire activated three Army HQs: the Thracian HQ in [[Constantinople]], the Western HQ in Salonika, and the Vardar HQ in [[Skopje]], against the Bulgarians, the Greeks and the Serbians respectively. Most of their available forces were allocated to these fronts. Smaller independent units were allocated elsewhere, mostly around heavily fortified cities.\n\nMontenegro was the first that declared war on 8 October{{sfn|Hall|2000}} (25 September O.S.). Its main thrust was towards [[Shkodra]], with secondary operations in the [[Novi Pazar]] area. The rest of the Allies, after giving a common ultimatum, declared war a week later. Bulgaria attacked towards Eastern Thrace, being stopped only at the outskirts of [[Constantinople]] at the [[\u00c7atalca]] line and the isthmus of the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], while secondary forces captured Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. Serbia attacked south towards [[Skopje]] and [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] and then turned west to present-day [[Albania]], reaching the [[Adriatic]], while a second Army captured [[Kosovo]] and linked with the Montenegrin forces. Greece's main forces attacked from [[Thessaly]] into Macedonia through the [[Sarantaporo]] strait and after capturing [[Thessaloniki]] on 12 November (on 26 October 1912, [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]) expanded its occupied area and linked up with the Serbian army to the northwest, while its main forces turned east towards [[Kavala]], reaching the Bulgarians. Another Greek army attacked into [[Epirus]] towards [[Ioannina]].<ref name=\"BA01\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011972 Balkan Wars] Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.</ref>\n\nOn the naval front, the Ottoman fleet twice exited the [[Dardanelles]] and was twice defeated by the [[Greek Navy]], in the battles of [[Naval Battle of Elli|Elli]] and [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Lemnos]]. Greek dominance on the [[Aegean Sea]] made it impossible for the Ottomans to transfer the planned troops from the Middle East to the Thracian (against the Bulgarian) and to the Macedonian (against the Greeks and Serbians) fronts.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} According to E.J. Erickson the Greek Navy also played a crucial, albeit indirect role, in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing no less than three Thracian Corps (see [[First Balkan War]], the Bulgarian theater of operations), a significant portion of the Ottoman Army there, in the all-important opening round of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} After the defeating of the Ottoman fleet the Greek Navy was also free to liberate the islands of the Aegean. General [[Nikola Ivanov]] identified the activity of the Greek Navy as the chief factor in the general success of the allies.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}}{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=65}}\n\nIn January, after a successful coup by young army officers, the Ottoman Empire decided to continue the war. After a failed Ottoman counter-attack in the Western-Thracian front, Bulgarian forces, with the help of the Serbian Army, managed to conquer [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|Adrianople]], while Greek forces managed to take [[Ioannina]] after defeating the Ottomans in the [[battle of Bizani]]. In the joint Serbian-Montenegrin theater of operation, the Montenegrin army besieged and captured the [[Shkodra]], ending the Ottoman presence in Europe west of the \u00c7atalca line after nearly 500 years. The war ended officially with the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaty of London]] on 30(17) May 1913.\n\n==Second Balkan War==\n{{Main article|Second Balkan War}}\n[[File:With the conquered Turk (1913) cholera patients arriving.png|thumb|250px|[[Cholera]] was common among the soldiers of the combatant nations]]\n[[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912\u20131913)]]\n\nThough the Balkan allies had fought together against the common enemy, that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. In the original document for the Balkans league, Serbia promised Bulgaria most of Macedonia. But before the first war come to an end, Serbia (in violation of the previous agreement) and Greece revealed their plan to keep possession of the territories that their forces had occupied. This act prompted the tsar of Bulgaria to invade his allies. The Second Balkan War broke out on 29(16) June 1913 when Bulgaria attacked its erstwhile allies in the First Balkan War, Serbia and Greece, while Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire intervened later against Bulgaria, with Romania attacking Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty.\n\nWhen the Greek army had entered [[Thessaloniki]] in the First Balkan War ahead of the Bulgarian 7th division by only a day, they were asked to allow a Bulgarian battalion to enter the city. Greece accepted in exchange for allowing a Greek unit to enter the city of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]. The Bulgarian unit that entered Thessaloniki turned out to be a 18,000-strong division instead of the battalion, something which caused concern among the Greeks, who viewed it as a Bulgarian attempt to establish a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over the city. In the event, due to the urgently needed reinforcements in the Thracian front, Bulgarian Headquarters was soon forced to remove its troops from the city (while the Greeks agreed by mutual treaty to remove their units based in [[Serres]]) and transport them to Dedea\u011fa\u00e7 (modern [[Alexandroupolis]]), but still it left behind a battalion that started fortifying its positions.\n\nGreece had also allowed the Bulgarians to control the stretch of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople railroad that lay in Greek-occupied territory, since Bulgaria controlled the largest part of this railroad towards Thrace. After the end of the operations in Thrace\u2014and confirming Greek concerns\u2014Bulgaria was not satisfied with the territory it controlled in Macedonia and immediately asked Greece to relinquish its control over Thessaloniki and the land north of [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]], effectively handing over all Aegean Macedonia. These unacceptable demands, together with the Bulgarian refusal to demobilize its army after the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] had ended the common war against the Ottomans, alarmed Greece, which decided to also keep its army mobilized.\n\nSimilarly, in northern Macedonia, the tension between Serbia and Bulgaria due to the latter\u2019s aspirations over [[Vardar Macedonia]] generated many incidents between their respective armies, prompting Serbia to keep its army mobilized. Serbia and Greece proposed that each of the three countries reduce its army by one fourth, as a first step to facilitate a peaceful solution, but Bulgaria rejected it. Seeing the omens, Greece and Serbia started a series of negotiations and signed a treaty on 1 June(19 May) 1913. With this treaty, a mutual border was agreed between the two countries, together with an agreement for mutual military and diplomatic support in case of a Bulgarian or/and Austro-Hungarian attack. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], being well informed, tried to stop the upcoming conflict on 8 June, by sending an identical personal message to the Kings of Bulgaria and Serbia, offering to act as arbitrator according to the provisions of the 1912 Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. But Bulgaria, by making the acceptance of Russian [[arbitration]] conditional, in effect denied any discussion, causing Russia to repudiate its alliance with Bulgaria (see Russo-Bulgarian military convention signed 31 May 1902).\n\nThe Serbs and the Greeks had a military advantage on the eve of the war because their armies confronted comparatively weak Ottoman forces in the First Balkan War and suffered relatively light casualties{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}}, while the Bulgarians were involved in heavy fighting in Thrace. The Serbs and Greeks had time to fortify their positions in Macedonia. The Bulgarians also held some advantages, controlling internal communication and supply lines.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}}\n\nOn 29(16) June 1913, General Savov, under direct orders of Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]], issued attacking orders against both Greece and Serbia without consulting the Bulgarian government and without any official declaration of war.<ref name=\"macedonia-istinata\">{{cite web |date=Winter 1995|url = http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html|title = THE MACEDONIAN ENIGMA|publisher=Magazine: Australia &World Affairs, | accessdate =15 April 2008 | last=George Phillipov |quote=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420191403/http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| archivedate= 20 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> During the night of 30(17) June 1913, they attacked the Serbian army at [[Bregalnica river]] and then the Greek army in [[Nigrita]]. The Serbian army resisted the sudden night attack, while most of soldiers did not even know who they were fighting with, as Bulgarian camps were located next to Serbs and were considered allies. Montenegro's forces were just a few kilometers away and also rushed to the battle. The Bulgarian attack was halted.\n\nThe Greek army was also successful.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}} It retreated according to plan for two days while [[Thessaloniki]] was cleared of the remaining Bulgarian regiment. Then, the Greek army counter-attacked and defeated the Bulgarians at [[Battle of Kilkis|Kilkis]] (Kukush), after which the mostly Bulgarian town was destroyed and part of it's mostly bulgarian population massacred by the Greek army <ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=keWGAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA279&lpg=PA279&dq=kukush+massacre&source=bl&ots=Vl7nRdQrCQ&sig=U5ZmW08ZeHX49vRhVaDuR2ljpmA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2qv-p6O3dAhWmVN8KHXDYCWUQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=kukush+massacre&f=false|title=Report of the International Commission to Inquire Into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars|first=International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan|last=Wars|date=26 October 2018|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|via=Google Books}}</ref>.

Part proceeded east and occupied [[Western Thrace]]. The rest of the Greek army advanced up to the [[Struma River]] valley, defeating the Bulgarian army in the battles of [[Battle of Doiran (1913)|Doiran]] and Mt. Beles, and continued its advance to the north towards [[Sofia]]. In the [[Battle of Kresna Gorge|Kresna straits]], the Greeks were ambushed by the Bulgarian 2nd and 1st Army newly arrived from the Serbian front that had already taken defensive positions there following the Bulgarian victory at [[battle of Kalimanci|Kalimanci]].\n\n[[File:Battle of Kilkis1913.jpg|thumb|Greek lithograph of the [[Battle of Kilkis\u2013Lachanas]]]]\nBy 30 July, the Greek army was outnumbered by the counter-attacking Bulgarian army, which attempted to encircle the Greeks in a [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]-type battle, by applying pressure on their flanks.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=121}} The Greek army was exhausted and faced logistical difficulties. The battle was continued for 11 days, between 29 July and 9 August over 20&nbsp;km of a maze of forests and mountains with no conclusion. The Greek King, seeing that the units he fought were from the Serbian front, tried to convince the Serbs to renew their attack, as the front ahead of them was now thinner, but the Serbs declined. By then, news came of the Romanian advance toward Sofia and its imminent fall. Facing the danger of encirclement, Constantine realized that his army could no longer continue hostilities, agreed to [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]' proposal and accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice as this had been communicated through Romania.\n\nRomania had raised an army and declared war on Bulgaria on 10 July(27 June) as it had from 28(15) June officially warned Bulgaria that it would not remain neutral in a new Balkan war, due to Bulgaria's refusal to cede the fortress of Silistra as promised before the First Balkan war in exchange for Romanian neutrality. Its forces encountered little resistance and by the time the Greeks accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice they had reached [[Vrazhdebna]], 7 miles from the center of [[Sofia]].\n\nSeeing the military position of the Bulgarian army the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] decided to intervene. They attacked, and, finding no opposition, managed to recover eastern [[Thrace]] with its fortified city of [[Edirne|Adrianople]], regaining an area in Europe which was only slightly larger than the present-day European territory of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n==Reactions among the Great Powers during the wars==\n[[File:Bazar Tirana (ca. 1900)2.jpg|thumb|[[Tirana]] [[Bazaar]] at the turn of the 20th century.]]\n\nThe developments that led to the '''First Balkan War''' did not go unnoticed by the Great Powers, but although there was an official consensus between the European Powers over the [[Eastern Question|territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire]], which led to a stern warning to the Balkan states, unofficially each of them took a different diplomatic approach due to their conflicting interests in the area. As a result, any possible preventive effect of the common official warning was cancelled by the mixed unofficial signals, and failed to prevent or to stop the war:\n\n*[[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a prime mover in the establishment of the Balkan League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against its rival, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<ref name=\"Stowell1\">{{cite book | last = Stowell | first = Ellery Cory|authorlink=Ellery Cory Stowell | title =The Diplomacy Of The War Of 1914: The Beginnings Of The War (1915) | publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC. | year =2009 | isbn =978-1-104-48758-4 | page =94 }}</ref> But it was unaware of the Bulgarian plans over Thrace and Constantinople, territories on which it had long-held ambitions, and on which it had just secured a secret agreement of expansion from its allies France and Britain, as a reward for participating in the upcoming [[World War I|Great War]] against the [[Central Powers]].\n*[[French Third Republic|France]], not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a totally negative position against the war, firmly informing its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austria-Hungary if it resulted from the actions of the Balkan League. The French, however, failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the Balkan conflict.\n*The [[British Empire]], although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire's integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging Greek entry into the League in order to counteract Russian influence. At the same time, it encouraged Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace, preferring a Bulgarian Thrace to a Russian one, despite the assurances the British had given to the Russians in regard to their expansion there.\n*[[Austria-Hungary]], struggling for a port on the [[Adriatic]] and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation's expansion in the area. At the same time, the Habsburg empire had its own internal problems with significant Slav populations that campaigned against German-Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of Austrian-held Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria's Slav subjects. But Austria-Hungary failed to secure German backup for a firm reaction. Initially, Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] told the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that Germany was ready to support Austria in all circumstances\u2014even at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the [[German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912]] the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and passed notes to that effect to the Habsburgs. Consequently, no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austrian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania.\n*[[German Empire|Germany]], already heavily involved in internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Empire. But, in her effort to win Bulgaria for the [[Central Powers]], and seeing the [[Sick man of Europe|inevitability]] of Ottoman disintegration, was toying with the idea of replacing the Balkan area of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in her [[Treaty of San Stefano|San Stefano]] borders\u2014an idea that was based on the German origin of the [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Bulgarian King]] and his anti-Russian sentiments.\n\nThe '''Second Balkan war''' was a catastrophic blow to Russian policies in the Balkans, which for centuries had focused on access to the \"warm seas\". First, it marked the end of the Balkan League, a vital arm of the Russian system of defense against Austria-Hungary. Second, the clearly pro-Serbian position Russia had been forced to take in the conflict, mainly due to the disagreements over land partitioning between Serbia and Bulgaria, caused a permanent break-up between the two countries. Accordingly, Bulgaria reverted its policy to one closer to the [[Central Powers]]' understanding over an anti-Serbian front, due to its new national aspirations, now expressed mainly against Serbia. As a result, Serbia was isolated militarily against its rival Austria-Hungary, a development that eventually doomed Serbia in the coming war a year later. But, most damaging, the new situation effectively trapped Russian foreign policy: After 1913, Russia could not afford losing its last ally in this crucial area and thus had no alternatives but to unconditionally support Serbia when the crisis between Serbia and Austria broke out in 1914. This was a position that inevitably drew her, although unwillingly, into a World War with devastating results for her, since she was less prepared (both militarily and socially) for that event than any other Great Power.\n\nAustria-Hungary took alarm at the great increase in Serbia's territory at the expense of its national aspirations in the region, as well as Serbia's rising status, especially to Austria-Hungary's Slavic populations. This concern was shared by Germany, which saw Serbia as a satellite of Russia. This contributed significantly to the two Central Powers' willingness to go to war as soon as possible.\n\nFinally, when [[Black Hand (Serbia)|a Serbian backed organization]] assassinated [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|the heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne]], causing the 1914 [[July Crisis]], no-one could stop the conflict and the [[First World War]] broke out.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSoviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated in ''Voini I Narodo-Nacelenie Europi'' (1960) that in the first and second Balkan wars there were 122,000 killed in action, 20,000 dead of wounds, and 82,000 dead of disease.\n[[File:Zapleneti turski topovi od strana na srpskata vojska pred crkata vo Kumanovo, Balkanska vojna, 1912.tif|thumb|Captured Turkish cannons by the Serbian army, displayed in front of a church in [[Kumanovo]], 1912]]\n\n==All Balkan War conflicts==\n===First Balkan War conflicts===\n====Bulgarian-Ottoman battles====\n{| style=\"width:76%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This involves equipment recommendations, procurement, routine testing and preventative maintenance, through to decommissioning and disposal. This role is also known as a [[Biomedical Equipment Technician|Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET)]] or [[clinical engineering]]. \n\nBiomedical engineering has recently emerged as its own study, as compared to many other engineering fields.  Such an evolution is common as a new field transition from being an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] specialization among already-established fields, to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of [[research and development]], spanning a broad array of subfields (see below). Prominent biomedical engineering applications include the development of [[biocompatible]] [[prosthesis|prostheses]], various diagnostic and therapeutic [[medical device]]s ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants, common imaging equipment such as [[MRI]]s and [[EKG]]/ECGs, [[regeneration (biology)|regenerative]] tissue growth, pharmaceutical [[medication|drugs]] and therapeutic biologicals.\n\n==Bioinformatics==\n{{Main article|Bioinformatics}}\n\n'''Bioinformatics'''  is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines computer science, statistics, mathematics, and engineering to analyze and interpret biological data.\n\nBioinformatics is considered both an umbrella term for the body of biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as a reference to specific analysis \"pipelines\" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of genomics. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidate genes and nucleotides (SNPs). Often, such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organisational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences.\n\n==Biomechanics==\n{{Main article|Biomechanics}}\nBiomechanics is the study of the structure and function of the mechanical aspects of biological systems, at any level from whole [[organism]]s to [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and [[cell organelle]]s,<ref>[[R. McNeill Alexander]] (2005) ''Mechanics of animal movement'', [[Current Biology]] Volume 15, Issue 16, 23 August 2005, Pages R616-R619. {{DOI|10.1016/j.cub.2005.08.016}}</ref> using the methods of [[mechanics]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Hatze| first1=Herbert| year=1974| title=The meaning of the term biomechanics| journal=Journal of Biomechanics| volume= 7| issue =12| pages=189\u2013190| doi=10.1016/0021-9290(74)90060-8}}</ref>\n\n==Biomaterial==\n{{Main article|Biomaterial}}\n\nA '''biomaterial''' is any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with living systems. As a science, '''biomaterials''' is about fifty years old. The study of biomaterials is called '''biomaterials science or biomaterials engineering'''. It has experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into the development of new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue engineering and materials science.\n\n==Biomedical optics==\nBiomedical optics refers to the interaction of biological tissue and light, and how this can be exploited for sensing, imaging, and treatment.<ref>[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medphys/contacts/people/bcox/MPHYX910_Biomedical_Optics_notes_Nov2015.pdf Introduction to Biomedical Optics]</ref>\n\n==Tissue engineering==\n{{Main article|Tissue engineering}}\n\nTissue engineering, like genetic engineering (see below), is a major segment of [[biotechnology]] \u2013 which overlaps significantly with BME.\n\nOne of the goals of tissue engineering is to create artificial organs (via biological material) for patients that need organ transplants. Biomedical engineers are currently researching methods of creating such organs.

Unlike traditional breeding, an indirect method of genetic manipulation, genetic engineering utilizes modern tools such as molecular cloning and transformation to directly alter the structure and characteristics of target genes. Genetic engineering techniques have found success in numerous applications. Some examples include the improvement of crop technology (''not a medical application'', but see [[biological systems engineering]]), the manufacture of synthetic human insulin through the use of modified bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse (cancer mouse) for research.\n\n==Neural engineering==\n\n[[Neural engineering]] (also known as neuroengineering) is a discipline that uses engineering techniques to understand, repair, replace, or enhance neural systems. Neural engineers are uniquely qualified to solve design problems at the interface of living neural tissue and non-living constructs.\n\n==Pharmaceutical engineering==\n\n[[Pharmaceutical engineering]] is an interdisciplinary science that includes drug engineering, novel drug delivery and targeting, pharmaceutical technology, unit operations of [[Chemical Engineering]], and Pharmaceutical Analysis. It may be deemed as a part of [[pharmacy]] due to its focus on the use of technology on chemical agents in providing better medicinal treatment. The [[International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering|ISPE]] is an international body that certifies this now rapidly emerging interdisciplinary science.\n\n==Medical devices==\n\n{{Main article|Medical devices|medical equipment|Medical technology}}\n\nThis is an ''extremely broad category''\u2014essentially covering all health care products that do not achieve their intended results through predominantly chemical (e.g., pharmaceuticals) or biological (e.g., vaccines) means, and do not involve metabolism.\n\nA medical device is intended for use in:\n* the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or\n* in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.\n\nSome examples include [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]], [[infusion pump]]s, the [[heart-lung machine]], [[dialysis]] machines, [[artificial organ]]s, [[implant (medicine)|implants]], [[artificial limb]]s, [[corrective lenses]], [[cochlear implant]]s, [[ocular prosthetics]], [[facial prosthetics]], somato prosthetics, and [[dental implant]]s.\n[[File:Opampinstrumentation.svg|250px|right|thumb|Biomedical [[instrumentation amplifier]] schematic used in monitoring low voltage biological signals, an example of a biomedical engineering application of [[electronic engineering]] to [[electrophysiology]].]]\n\n[[Stereolithography]] is a practical example of ''medical modeling'' being used to create physical objects.

Devices in this category include tongue depressors, bedpans, elastic bandages, examination gloves, and hand-held surgical instruments and other similar types of common equipment.\n* Class II devices are subject to special controls in addition to the general controls of Class I devices. Special controls may include special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, and [[Postmarketing surveillance|postmarket surveillance]]. Devices in this class are typically non-invasive and include X-ray machines, PACS, powered wheelchairs, infusion pumps, and surgical drapes.\n* Class III devices generally require premarket approval (PMA) or premarket notification (510k), a scientific review to ensure the device's safety and effectiveness, in addition to the general controls of Class I.  Examples include replacement heart valves, hip and knee joint implants, silicone gel-filled breast implants, implanted cerebellar stimulators, implantable pacemaker pulse generators and endosseous (intra-bone) implants.\n\n===Medical imaging===\n{{Main article|Medical imaging}}\n\nMedical/biomedical imaging is a major segment of [[medical device]]s. This area deals with enabling clinicians to directly or indirectly \"view\" things not visible in plain sight (such as due to their size, and/or location).  This can involve utilizing ultrasound, magnetism, UV, radiology, and other means.\n\n[[File:brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An [[MRI]] scan of a human head, an example of a biomedical engineering application of [[electrical engineering]] to [[diagnostic imaging]]. [[:Image:brain chrischan 300.gif|Click here]] to view an animated sequence of slices.]]Imaging technologies are often essential to medical diagnosis, and are typically the most complex equipment found in a hospital including: [[fluoroscopy]], [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[nuclear medicine]], [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[PET-CT scanning|PET-CT scans]], projection radiography such as [[X-ray]]s and [[Computed tomography|CT scans]], [[tomography]], [[ultrasound]], [[optical microscopy]], and [[electron microscopy]].\n\n===Implants===\nAn implant is a kind of medical device made to replace and act as a missing biological structure (as compared with a transplant, which indicates transplanted biomedical tissue). The surface of implants that contact the body might be made of a biomedical material such as titanium, silicone or apatite depending on what is the most functional. In some cases, implants contain electronics, e.g. artificial pacemakers and cochlear implants. Some implants are bioactive, such as subcutaneous drug delivery devices in the form of implantable pills or [[drug-eluting stent]]s.\n\n[[File:Army prosthetic.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Artificial limb]]s: The right arm is an example of a [[prosthesis]], and the left arm is an example of [[Transradial prosthesis|myoelectric control]].]]\n[[File:Prosthetic eye.png|thumb|200px|A [[Ocular prosthesis|prosthetic eye]], an example of a biomedical engineering application of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[biocompatible material]]s to [[ophthalmology]].]]\n\n===Bionics===\n{{further information|Bionics#In medicine}}\nArtificial body part replacements are one of the many applications of bionics. Concerned with the intricate and thorough study of the properties and function of human body systems, bionics may be applied to solve some engineering problems. Careful study of the different functions and processes of the eyes, ears, and other organs paved the way for improved cameras, television, radio transmitters and receivers, and many other useful tools. These developments have indeed made our lives better, but the best contribution that bionics has made is in the field of biomedical engineering (the building of useful replacements for various parts of the human body). Modern hospitals now have available spare parts to replace body parts badly damaged by injury or disease [Citation Needed]. Biomedical engineers work hand in hand with doctors to build these artificial body parts.\n\n==Clinical engineering==\n{{Main article|Clinical engineering}}\n\n[[Clinical engineering]] is the branch of biomedical engineering dealing with the actual implementation of [[medical equipment]] and technologies in hospitals or other clinical settings. Major roles of clinical engineers include training and supervising [[Biomedical Equipment Technician|biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs)]], selecting technological products/services and logistically managing their implementation, working with governmental regulators on inspections/audits, and serving as technological consultants for other hospital staff (e.g. physicians, administrators, I.T., etc.). Clinical engineers also advise and collaborate with medical device producers regarding prospective design improvements based on clinical experiences, as well as monitor the progression of the state of the art so as to redirect procurement patterns accordingly.\n\nTheir inherent focus on ''practical'' implementation of technology has tended to keep them oriented more towards ''incremental''-level redesigns and reconfigurations, as opposed to revolutionary research & development or ideas that would be many years from clinical adoption; however, there is a growing effort to expand this time-horizon over which clinical engineers can influence the trajectory of biomedical innovation. In their various roles, they form a \"bridge\" between the primary designers and the end-users, by combining the perspectives of being both 1) close to the point-of-use, while 2) trained in product and process engineering. Clinical engineering departments will sometimes hire not just biomedical engineers, but also industrial/systems engineers to help address operations research/optimization, human factors, cost analysis, etc. Also see [[safety engineering]] for a discussion of the procedures used to design safe systems.\n\n==Rehabilitation engineering==\n{{Main article |Rehabilitation engineering}}\n\n'''Rehabilitation engineering''' is the systematic application of engineering sciences to design, develop, adapt, test, evaluate, apply, and distribute technological solutions to problems confronted by individuals with disabilities. Functional areas addressed through rehabilitation engineering may include mobility, communications, hearing, vision, and cognition, and activities associated with employment, independent living, education, and integration into the community.<ref name=\"EnderleBronzino2012\"/>\n\nWhile some rehabilitation engineers have master's degrees in rehabilitation engineering, usually a subspecialty of Biomedical engineering, most rehabilitation engineers have undergraduate or graduate degrees in biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, or electrical engineering. A Portuguese university provides an undergraduate degree and a master's degree in Rehabilitation Engineering and Accessibility.<ref name = BBC/><ref name=\"cnngrow\"/> Qualification to become a Rehab' Engineer in the UK is possible via a University BSc Honours Degree course such as Health Design & Technology Institute, Coventry University.<ref name=\"chicagoliver\"/>\n\nThe rehabilitation process for people with disabilities often entails the design of assistive devices such as Walking aids intended to promote inclusion of their users into the mainstream of society, commerce, and recreation.[[File:SinusRhythmLabels.svg|200px|right|thumb|Schematic representation of a normal ECG trace showing ''[[sinus rhythm]];'' an example of widely used clinical medical equipment (operates by applying [[electronic engineering]] to [[electrophysiology]] and [[medical diagnosis]]).]]\n\n==Regulatory issues==\n{{refimprove|section|date=August 2017}}\nRegulatory issues have been constantly increased in the last decades to respond to the many incidents caused by devices to patients. For example, from 2008 to 2011, in US, there were 119 FDA recalls of medical devices classified as class I. According to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), [[Class I recall]] is associated to \"a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death\"<ref>U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Medical & Radiation Emitting Device Recalls http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfres/res.cfm</ref>\n\nRegardless of the country-specific legislation, the main regulatory objectives coincide worldwide.<ref name=\":6\">World Health Organization (WHO), 2003 Medical Device Regulations Global overview and guiding principles. http://www.who.int/medical_devices/publications/en/MD_Regulations.pdf (last visit Sept 2013)</ref> For example, in the medical device regulations, a product must be: 1) safe ''and'' 2) effective and 3) for all the manufactured devices\n\nA product is safe if patients, users and third parties do not run unacceptable risks of physical hazards (death, injuries, \u2026) in its intended use. Protective measures have to be introduced on the devices to reduce residual risks at acceptable level if compared with the benefit derived from the use of it.\n\nA product is effective if it performs as specified by the manufacturer in the intended use. Effectiveness is achieved through clinical evaluation, compliance to performance standards or demonstrations of substantial equivalence with an already marketed device.\n\nThe previous features have to be ensured for all the manufactured items of the medical device. This requires that a quality system shall be in place for all the relevant entities and processes that may impact safety and effectiveness over the whole medical device lifecycle.\n\nThe medical device engineering area is among the most heavily regulated fields of engineering, and practicing biomedical engineers must routinely consult and cooperate with regulatory law attorneys and other experts.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the principal healthcare regulatory authority in the United States, having jurisdiction over medical ''devices, drugs, biologics, and combination'' products.  The paramount objectives driving policy decisions by the FDA are safety and effectiveness of healthcare products that have to be assured through a quality system in place as specified under [[Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations|21 CFR 829 regulation]]. In addition, because biomedical engineers often develop devices and technologies for \"consumer\" use, such as physical therapy devices (which are also \"medical\" devices), these may also be governed in some respects by the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]. The greatest hurdles tend to be 510K \"clearance\" (typically for Class 2 devices) or pre-market \"approval\" (typically for drugs and class 3 devices).\n\nIn the European context, safety effectiveness and quality is ensured through the \"Conformity Assessment\" that is defined as \"the method by which a manufacturer demonstrates that its device complies with the requirements of the European [[Medical Devices Directive|Medical Device Directive]]\". The directive specifies different procedures according to the class of the device ranging from the simple Declaration of Conformity (Annex VII) for Class I devices to EC verification (Annex IV), Production quality assurance (Annex V), Product quality assurance (Annex VI) and Full quality assurance (Annex II). The Medical Device Directive specifies detailed procedures for Certification. In general terms, these procedures include tests and verifications that are to be contained in specific deliveries such as the risk management file,  the technical file and the quality system deliveries.  The risk management file is the first deliverable that conditions the following design and manufacturing steps. Risk management stage shall drive the product so that product risks are reduced at an acceptable level with respect to the benefits expected for the patients for the use of the device. The [[technical file]] contains all the documentation data and records supporting medical device certification. FDA technical file has similar content although organized in different structure.  The Quality System deliverables usually includes procedures that ensure quality throughout all product life cycle. The same standard (ISO EN 13485) is usually applied for quality management systems in US and worldwide.\n\n[[File:Hip replacement Image 3684-PH.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Implants, such as [[artificial hip]] joints, are generally extensively regulated due to the invasive nature of such devices.]]\n\nIn the European Union, there are certifying entities named \"[[Notified Body|Notified Bodies]]\", accredited by European Member States. The Notified Bodies must ensure the effectiveness of the certification process for all medical devices apart from the class I devices where a declaration of conformity produced by the manufacturer is sufficient for marketing. Once a product has passed all the steps required by the Medical Device Directive, the device is entitled to bear a [[CE marking]], indicating that the device is believed to be safe and effective when used as intended, and, therefore, it can be marketed within the European Union area.\n\nThe different regulatory arrangements sometimes result in particular technologies being developed first for either the U.S. or in Europe depending on the more favorable form of regulation.  While nations often strive for substantive harmony to facilitate cross-national distribution, philosophical differences about the ''optimal extent'' of regulation can be a hindrance; more restrictive regulations seem appealing on an intuitive level, but critics decry the tradeoff cost in terms of slowing access to life-saving developments.\n\n===RoHS II===\nDirective 2011/65/EU, better known as RoHS 2 is a recast of legislation originally introduced in 2002. The original EU legislation \"Restrictions of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronics Devices\" (RoHS Directive 2002/95/EC) was replaced and superseded by 2011/65/EU published in July 2011 and commonly known as RoHS 2.\n[[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS]] seeks to limit the dangerous substances in circulation in electronics products, in particular toxins and heavy metals, which are subsequently released into the environment when such devices are recycled.\n\nThe scope of RoHS 2 is widened to include products previously excluded, such as medical devices and industrial equipment. In addition, manufacturers are now obliged to provide conformity risk assessments and test reports \u2013 or explain why they are lacking. For the first time, not only manufacturers, but also importers and distributors share a responsibility to ensure Electrical and Electronic Equipment within the scope of RoHS comply with the hazardous substances limits and have a CE mark on their products.\n\n===IEC 60601===\nThe new International Standard [[IEC 60601]] for home healthcare electro-medical devices defining the requirements for devices used in the home healthcare environment. IEC 60601-1-11 (2010) must now be incorporated into the design and verification of a wide range of home use and point of care medical devices along with other applicable standards in the IEC 60601 3rd edition series.\n\nThe mandatory date for implementation of the EN European version of the standard is June 1, 2013. The US FDA requires the use of the standard on June 30, 2013, while Health Canada recently extended the required date from June 2012 to April 2013.  The North American agencies will only require these standards for new device submissions, while the EU will take the more severe approach of requiring all applicable devices being placed on the market to consider the home healthcare standard.\n\n===AS/NZS 3551:2012===\n[[Standards Australia|AS/ANS 3551:2012]] is the Australian and New Zealand standards for the management of medical devices. The standard specifies the procedures required to maintain a wide range of medical assets in a clinical setting (e.g. Hospital).<ref name=\"Standards Australia\">{{cite web|url=http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/details.aspx?ProductID=1595659|title=AS/NZS 3551:2012 Management programs for medical equipment|last=|first=|date=2016-10-18|website=|publisher=Standards Australia|isbn=978-1-74342-277-9|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2016-10-18}}</ref> The standards are based on the IEC 606101 standards.\n\nThe standard covers a wide range of medical equipment management elements including, procurement, acceptance testing, maintenance (electrical safety and preventative maintenance testing) and decommissioning.\n\n==Training and certification==\n\n===Education===\n\nBiomedical engineers require considerable knowledge of both engineering and biology, and typically have a Bachelor's (B.Tech., B.S.) or Master's (M.S., M.Tech., M.S.E., or M.Eng.) or a doctoral (Ph.D.) degree in BME (Biomedical Engineering) or another branch of engineering with considerable potential for BME overlap. As interest in BME increases, many engineering colleges now have a Biomedical Engineering Department or Program, with offerings ranging from the undergraduate (B.Tech., B.S., B.Eng. or B.S.E.) to doctoral levels. Biomedical engineering has only recently been emerging as ''its own discipline'' rather than a cross-disciplinary hybrid specialization of other disciplines; and BME programs at all levels are becoming more widespread, including the [[Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering]] which actually includes so much biological science content that many students use it as a \"[[pre-med]]\" major in preparation for [[medical school]]. The number of biomedical engineers is expected to rise as both a cause and effect of improvements in medical technology.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics] - Profile for Engineers {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219092732/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm |date=February 19, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn the U.S., an increasing number of [[undergraduate]] programs are also becoming recognized by [[ABET]] as accredited bioengineering/biomedical engineering programs.

The reputation of many undergraduate degrees are also linked to the institution's graduate or research programs, which have some tangible factors for rating, such as research funding and volume, publications and citations. With BME specifically, the ranking of a university's hospital and medical school can also be a significant factor in the perceived prestige of its BME department/program.\n\n[[Graduate school|Graduate education]] is a particularly important aspect in BME. While many engineering fields (such as mechanical or electrical engineering) do not need graduate-level training to obtain an entry-level job in their field, the majority of BME positions do prefer or even require them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm#outlook|work=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|title=Job Outlook for Engineers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219172748/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm|archivedate=December 19, 2011|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Since most BME-related professions involve scientific research, such as in [[pharmaceutical]] and [[medical device]] development, graduate education is almost a requirement (as undergraduate degrees typically do not involve sufficient research training and experience). This can be either a Masters or Doctoral level degree; while in certain specialties a Ph.D. is notably more common than in others, it is hardly ever the majority (except in academia). In fact, the perceived need for some kind of graduate credential is so strong that some undergraduate BME programs will actively discourage students from majoring in BME without an expressed intention to also obtain a master's degree or apply to medical school afterwards.\n\nGraduate programs in BME, like in other scientific fields, are highly varied, and particular programs may emphasize certain aspects within the field. They may also feature extensive collaborative efforts with programs in other fields (such as the University's Medical School or other engineering divisions), owing again to the interdisciplinary nature of BME. M.S. and Ph.D. programs will typically require applicants to have an undergraduate degree in BME, or ''another engineering'' discipline (plus certain life science coursework), or ''life science'' (plus certain engineering coursework).\n\nEducation in BME also varies greatly around the world. By virtue of its extensive biotechnology sector, its numerous major universities, and relatively few internal barriers, the U.S. has progressed a great deal in its development of BME education and training opportunities. Europe, which also has a large biotechnology sector and an impressive education system, has encountered trouble in creating uniform standards as the European community attempts to supplant some of the national jurisdictional barriers that still exist. Recently, initiatives such as BIOMEDEA have sprung up to develop BME-related education and professional standards.<ref>{{cite web|date=September 2005|url=http://www.bmt.uni-stuttgart.de/biomedea/biomedea.htm|title=BIOMEDEA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506113817/http://www.bmt.uni-stuttgart.de/biomedea/biomedea.htm|archivedate=May 6, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Other countries, such as Australia, are recognizing and moving to correct deficiencies in their BME education.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lithgow, B.

The US model has generally been only to require the practicing engineers offering engineering services that impact the public welfare, safety, safeguarding of life, health, or property to be licensed, while engineers working in private industry without a direct offering of engineering services to the public or other businesses, education, and government need not be licensed. This is notably not the case in many other countries, where a license is as legally necessary to practice engineering as it is for law or medicine.\n\nBiomedical engineering is regulated in some countries, such as Australia, but registration is typically only recommended and not required.<ref>[http://www.nerb.org.au/aop/nper_areas_biomedical.cfm National Engineering Registration Board - Areas Of Practice - NPER Areas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105230101/http://www.nerb.org.au/aop/nper_areas_biomedical.cfm |date=January 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, mechanical engineers working in the areas of Medical Engineering, [[Bioengineering]] or Biomedical engineering can gain [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]] status through the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]].

For the second exam, called the Principles and Practices, Part 2, or the Professional Engineering exam, candidates may select a particular engineering discipline's content to be tested on; there is currently not an option for BME with this, meaning that any biomedical engineers seeking a license must prepare to take this examination in another category (which does not affect the actual license, since most jurisdictions do not recognize discipline specialties anyway).  However, the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) is, as of 2009, exploring the possibility of seeking to implement a BME-specific version of this exam to facilitate biomedical engineers pursuing licensure.\n\nBeyond governmental registration, certain private-sector professional/industrial organizations also offer certifications with varying degrees of prominence.  One such example is the Certified Clinical Engineer (CCE) certification for Clinical engineers.\n\n==Career prospects==\nIn 2012 there were about 19,400 biomedical engineers employed in the US, and the field was predicted to grow by 27% (much faster than average) from 2012 to 2022.<ref>Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor.

''[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]''.</ref>]]\nIn 1912\u20131913 the [[First Balkan War]] broke out when the nation-states of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] united in an [[Balkan League|alliance]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. As a result of the war, almost all remaining European territories of the [[Ottoman Empire]] were captured and partitioned among the allies. Ensuing events also led to the creation of an independent [[Albania]]n state. Bulgaria insisted on its status quo territorial integrity, divided and shared by the Great Powers next to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)]] in other boundaries and on the pre-war Bulgarian-Serbian agreement. Bulgaria was provoked by the backstage deals between its former allies, Serbia and Greece, on the allocation of the spoils at the end of the First Balkan War. At the time, Bulgaria was fighting at the main Thracian Front. Bulgaria marks the beginning of [[Second Balkan War]] when it attacked them. The Serbs and the Greeks repulsed single attacks, but when the Greek army invaded Bulgaria together with an unprovoked Romanian intervention in the back, Bulgaria collapsed. The Ottoman Empire used the opportunity to recapture [[Eastern Thrace]], establishing its new western borders that still stand today as part of modern Turkey.\n\nThe [[First World War]] was sparked in the Balkans in 1914 when members of [[Mlada Bosna]], a revolutionary organization with predominantly Serbian and pro-Yugoslav members, [[assassination in Sarajevo|assassinated]] the Austro-Hungarian heir [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina's capital, [[Sarajevo]]. That caused a war between the two countries which\u2014through the existing [[Allies of World War I|chains of alliances]]\u2014led to the First World War. The Ottoman Empire soon joined the [[Central Powers]] becoming one of the three empires participating in that alliance. The next year Bulgaria joined the [[Central Powers]] attacking Serbia, which was successfully fighting Austro-Hungary to the north for a year. That led to Serbia's defeat and the intervention of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] in the Balkans which sent an expeditionary force to establish a new [[Macedonian front|front]], the third one of that war, which soon also became static. The participation of Greece in the war three years later, in 1918, on the part of the Entente finally altered the balance between the opponents leading to the collapse of the common German-Bulgarian front there, which caused the exit of Bulgaria from the war, and in turn the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, ending the First World War.<ref>Encyclopedia of World War I, Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts, p.242</ref>\n\nWith the start of the [[Second World War]], all Balkan countries, with the exception of Greece, were allies of [[Nazi Germany]], having bilateral military agreements or being part of the [[Axis Pact]]. [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]] expanded the war in the Balkans by using its protectorate Albania to [[Greco-Italian War|invade Greece]]. After repelling the attack, the Greeks counterattacked, invading Italy-held Albania and causing Nazi Germany's intervention in the Balkans to help its ally.<ref>Europe in Flames, J.

Yugoslavia immediately disintegrated when those loyal to the Serbian King and the Croatian units mutinied.{{sfn | Schreiber, Stegemann and Vogel | 1995 | p=521}} Greece resisted, but, after two months of fighting, collapsed and was occupied. The two countries were partitioned between the three Axis allies, Bulgaria, Germany and Italy, and the [[Independent State of Croatia]], a puppet state of Italy and Germany.\n\nDuring the occupation the population suffered considerable hardship due to repression and starvation, to which the population reacted by creating a mass resistance movement.<ref>Inside Hitler's Greece:The Experience of Occupation, Mark Mazower, 1993</ref> Together with the early and extremely heavy winter of that year (which caused hundreds of thousands deaths among the poorly fed population), the German invasion had disastrous effects in the timetable of the [[Operation Barbarossa|planned invasion in Russia]] causing a significant delay,<ref>Hermann Goring: Hitler's Second-In-Command, Fred Ramen, 2002, p.61</ref> which had major consequences during the course of the war.<ref>The encyclopedia of codenames of World War II#Marita, Christopher Chant, 1986, p. 125\u20136</ref>\n\nFinally, at the end of 1944, the Soviets entered Romania and Bulgaria forcing the Germans out of the Balkans. They left behind a region largely ruined as a result of wartime exploitation.\n\n====Cold War====\nDuring the [[Cold War]], most of the countries on the Balkans were governed by communist governments. Greece became the first battleground of the emerging Cold War. The [[Truman Doctrine]] was the US response to the [[Greek Civil War|civil war]], which raged from 1944 to 1949. This civil war, unleashed by the [[Communist Party of Greece]], backed by communist volunteers from neighboring countries (Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia), led to massive American assistance for the non-communist Greek government. With this backing, Greece managed to defeat the partisans and, ultimately, remained the only non-communist country in the region.\n\nHowever, despite being under communist governments, [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1948) and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] (1961) fell out with the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia, led by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] (1892\u20131980), first propped up then rejected the idea of merging with [[Bulgaria]] and instead sought closer relations with the West, later even spearheaded, together with India and Egypt the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Albania on the other hand gravitated toward [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], later adopting an [[isolationism|isolationist]] position.\n\nAs the only non-communist countries, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] were (and still are) part of [[NATO]] composing the southeastern wing of the alliance.\n\n====Post\u2013Cold War====\nIn the 1990s, the transition of the regions' ex-Soviet bloc countries towards democratic free-market societies went peacefully with the exception of Yugoslavia. [[Yugoslav Wars|Wars between the former Yugoslav republics]] broke out after Slovenia and Croatia held free elections and their people voted for independence on their respective countries' referenda. Serbia in turn declared the dissolution of the union as unconstitutional and the [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslavian army]] unsuccessfully tried to maintain status quo. Slovenia and Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991, followed by the [[Ten-Day War]] in Slovenia. Till October 1991, the Army withdrew from Slovenia, and in Croatia, the [[Croatian War of Independence]] would continue [[Operation Storm|until 1995]]. In the ensuing 10 years armed confrontation, gradually all the other Republics declared independence, with [[Bosnian War|Bosnia being the most affected]] by the fighting. The long lasting wars resulted in a United Nations intervention and [[NATO intervention in Bosnia|NATO]] ground and air forces [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|took action against Serb forces]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Serbia]].\n\n[[File:Former Yugoslavia 2008.PNG|upright=1.15|thumb|State entities on the former territory of [[Yugoslavia]], 2008]]\nFrom the dissolution of Yugoslavia six republics achieved international recognition as sovereign republics, but these are traditionally included in Balkans: [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]].

After the [[Cubic atom|cubic model]] (1902), the [[plum-pudding model]] (1904), the [[Saturnian model]] (1904), and the [[Rutherford model]] (1911) came the ''Rutherford\u2013Bohr model'' or just ''Bohr model'' for short (1913). The improvement to the Rutherford model is mostly a quantum physical interpretation of it. \nThe model's key success lay in explaining the [[Rydberg formula]] for the spectral [[Hydrogen spectral series|emission lines]] of atomic [[hydrogen]]. While the Rydberg formula had been known experimentally, it did not gain a theoretical underpinning until the Bohr model was introduced. Not only did the Bohr model explain the reason for the structure of the Rydberg formula, it also provided a justification for its empirical results in terms of fundamental physical constants.\n\nThe Bohr model is a relatively primitive model of the [[hydrogen atom]], compared to the [[Atomic orbital|valence shell atom]]. As a theory, it can be derived as a [[Orders of approximation#First-order|first-order approximation]] of the hydrogen atom using the broader and much more accurate [[quantum mechanics]] and thus may be considered to be an [[obsolete scientific theory]]. However, because of its simplicity, and its correct results for selected systems (see below for application), the Bohr model is still commonly taught to introduce students to [[quantum mechanics]] or [[Energy level#Energy level diagrams|energy level diagrams]] before moving on to the more accurate, but more complex, valence shell atom. A related model was originally proposed by [[Arthur Erich Haas]] in 1910 but was rejected. The quantum theory of the period between [[Planck#Black-body radiation|Planck's discovery of the quantum]] (1900) and the advent of a full-blown [[quantum mechanics]] (1925) is often referred to as the [[old quantum theory]].\n\n== Origin ==\n[[File:Atome bohr couches electroniques KLM.svg|thumb|Bohr model showing maximum electrons per shell with shells labeled in [[X-ray notation]]]]\nIn the early 20th century, [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment|experiments by Ernest Rutherford]] established that [[atom]]s consisted of a diffuse cloud of negatively charged [[electron]]s surrounding a small, dense, positively charged [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]].<ref name=\"bohr1\">{{cite journal | author=Niels Bohr | title=On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules, Part I | journal=Philosophical Magazine | year=1913 | volume=26 | pages=1\u201324 | doi= 10.1080/14786441308634955| url=http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/bohr13/eng.pdf | issue=151}}</ref> Given this experimental data, Rutherford naturally considered a planetary-model atom, the [[Rutherford model]] of 1911 \u2013 electrons orbiting a solar nucleus \u2013 however, said planetary-model atom has a technical difficulty. The laws of classical mechanics (i.e. the [[Larmor formula]]), predict that the electron will release [[electromagnetic radiation]] while orbiting a nucleus. Because the electron would lose energy, it would rapidly spiral inwards, collapsing into the nucleus on a timescale of around 16 picoseconds.<ref>[http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/orbitdecay.pdf Olsen and McDonald 2005]</ref> This atom model is disastrous, because it predicts that all atoms are unstable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/7512|title=CK12 \u2013 Chemistry Flexbook Second Edition \u2013 The Bohr Model of the Atom|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlso, as the electron spirals inward, the emission would rapidly increase in frequency as the orbit got smaller and faster. This would produce a continuous smear, in frequency, of electromagnetic radiation. However, late 19th century experiments with [[electric discharge]]s have shown that atoms will only emit light (that is, electromagnetic radiation) at certain discrete frequencies.\n\nTo overcome this hard difficulty, [[Niels Bohr]] proposed, in 1913, what is now called the ''Bohr model of the atom''. He suggested that electrons could only have certain ''classical'' motions:\n# Electrons in atoms orbit the nucleus.\n# The electrons can only orbit stably, without radiating, in certain orbits (called by Bohr the \"stationary orbits\"<ref>{{cite journal | author=Niels Bohr | title=On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules, Part II Systems Containing Only a Single Nucleus | journal=Philosophical Magazine | year=1913 | volume=26 | pages=476\u2013502 | url=http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/bohr13b/eng.pdf | doi=10.1080/14786441308634993 | issue=153}}</ref>) at a certain discrete set of distances from the nucleus. These orbits are associated with definite energies and are also called energy shells or [[energy level]]s. In these orbits, the electron's acceleration does not result in radiation and energy loss as required by classical electromagnetics. The Bohr model of an atom was based upon Planck's quantum theory of radiation.\n# Electrons can only gain and lose energy by jumping from one allowed orbit to another, absorbing or emitting electromagnetic radiation with a frequency ''\u03bd'' determined by the energy difference of the levels according to the [[Planck relation]]:<blockquote><math>\\Delta E = E_2-E_1 = h \\nu,</math></blockquote> where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. The frequency of the radiation emitted at an orbit of period ''T'' is as it would be in classical mechanics; it is the reciprocal of the classical orbit period:<blockquote><math> \\nu = \\frac{1}{T}.</math></blockquote>\n# The angular momentum, ''L'',  of the orbiting electron is quantised such that:<blockquote><math> m_\\mathrm{e} v r = n \\hbar </math>\n</blockquote>\nwhere ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ... is called the [[principal quantum number]], and {{math|''\u0127'' {{=}} ''h''/2''\u03c0''}}. The lowest value of ''n'' is 1; this gives a smallest possible orbital radius of 0.0529&nbsp;nm known as the [[Bohr radius]]. Once an electron is in this lowest orbit, it can get no closer to the proton. Starting from the angular momentum quantum rule, Bohr<ref name=\"bohr1\" /> was able to calculate the [[Bohr model#Electron energy levels|energies of the allowed orbits]] of the hydrogen atom and other [[Bohr model#Shell model of the atom|hydrogen-like]] atoms and ions.\n\nOther points are:\n# Like Einstein's theory of the [[Photoelectric effect]], Bohr's formula assumes that during a quantum jump a ''discrete'' amount of energy is radiated. However, unlike Einstein, Bohr stuck to the ''classical'' [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell theory]] of the electromagnetic field. Quantization of the electromagnetic field was explained by the discreteness of the atomic [[Bohr model#Electron energy levels|energy levels]]; Bohr did not believe in the existence of [[photon]]s.\n# According to the Maxwell theory the frequency ''\u03bd'' of classical radiation is equal to the rotation frequency ''\u03bd''<sub>rot</sub> of the electron in its orbit, with [[harmonics]] at integer multiples of this frequency. This result is obtained from the Bohr model for jumps between energy levels ''E''<sub>''n''</sub> and ''E''<sub>''n''\u2212''k''</sub> when ''k'' is much smaller than ''n''. These jumps reproduce the frequency of the ''k''-th harmonic of orbit ''n''. For sufficiently large values of ''n'' (so-called [[Rydberg state]]s), the two orbits involved in the emission process have nearly the same rotation frequency, so that the classical orbital frequency is not ambiguous. But for small ''n'' (or large ''k''), the radiation frequency has no unambiguous classical interpretation. This marks the birth of the [[correspondence principle]], requiring quantum theory to agree with the classical theory only in the limit of large quantum numbers.\n# The [[BKS theory|Bohr-Kramers-Slater theory]] (BKS theory) is a failed attempt to extend the Bohr model, which violates the [[conservation of energy]] and [[Conservation of linear momentum|momentum]] in quantum jumps, with the conservation laws only holding on average.\n\nBohr's condition, that the angular momentum is an integer multiple of ''\u0127'' was later reinterpreted in 1924 by [[de Broglie]] as a [[standing wave]] condition: the electron is described by a wave and a whole number of wavelengths must fit along the circumference of the electron's orbit:\n:<math>n \\lambda = 2 \\pi r.</math>\n\nBohr described angular momentum of the electron orbit as 1/2h while [[de Broglie wavelength|de Broglie's wavelength]] of {{math|''\u03bb'' {{=}} ''h''/''p''}} described h divided by the electron momentum. In 1913, however, Bohr justified his rule by appealing to the correspondence principle, without providing any sort of wave interpretation. In 1913, the wave behavior of matter particles such as the electron (i.e., [[matter wave]]s) was not suspected.\n\nIn 1925, a new kind of mechanics was proposed, [[quantum mechanics]], in which Bohr's model of electrons traveling in quantized orbits was extended into a [[matrix mechanics|more accurate model]] of electron motion. The new theory was proposed by [[Werner Heisenberg]]. [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|Another form]] of the same theory, wave mechanics, was discovered by the Austrian physicist [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] independently, and by different reasoning. Schr\u00f6dinger employed de Broglie's matter waves, but sought wave solutions of a three-dimensional wave equation describing electrons that were constrained to move about the nucleus of a [[hydrogen-like atom]], by being trapped by the potential of the positive nuclear charge.\n\n== Electron energy levels ==\n[[File:Blausen 0342 ElectronEnergyLevels.png|thumb|Models depicting electron energy levels in hydrogen, helium, lithium, and neon]]\nThe Bohr model gives almost exact results only for a system where two charged points orbit each other at speeds much less than that of light. This not only involves one-electron systems such as the [[hydrogen atom]], singly ionized [[helium]], and doubly ionized [[lithium]], but it includes [[positronium]] and [[Rydberg states]] of any atom where one electron is far away from everything else. It can be used for [[K-line (x-ray)|K-line]] X-ray transition calculations if other assumptions are added (see [[#Moseley's law and calculation of K-alpha X-ray emission lines|Moseley's law]] below). In high energy physics, it can be used to calculate the masses of [[Quark|heavy quark]] [[meson]]s.\n\nCalculation of the orbits requires two assumptions.\n\n* '''Classical mechanics'''\n:The electron is held in a circular orbit by electrostatic attraction. The [[centripetal force]] is equal to the [[Coulomb law|Coulomb force]].\n::<math> {m_\\mathrm{e} v^2\\over r} = {Zk_\\mathrm{e} e^2 \\over r^2} </math>\n:where ''m''<sub>e</sub> is the [[electron]]'s mass, ''e'' is the charge of the electron, ''k''<sub>e</sub> is [[Coulomb's constant]] and ''Z'' is the atom's [[atomic number]]. It is assumed here that the mass of the nucleus is much larger than the electron mass (which is a good assumption). This equation determines the electron's speed at any radius:\n:: <math> v = \\sqrt{ Zk_\\mathrm{e} e^2 \\over m_\\mathrm{e} r}. </math>\n\n: It also determines the electron's total energy at any radius:\n:: <math> E= -{1\\over 2} m_\\mathrm{e} v^2\n </math>\n\n:The total energy is negative and inversely proportional to ''r''. This means that it takes energy to pull the orbiting electron away from the proton. For infinite values of ''r'', the energy is zero, corresponding to a motionless electron infinitely far from the proton. The total energy is half the [[potential energy]], which is also true for noncircular orbits by the [[virial theorem]].\n\n* '''A quantum rule'''\n\n:The [[angular momentum]] {{nowrap|''L'' {{=}} ''m''<sub>e</sub>''vr''}} is an integer multiple of ''\u0127'':\n::<math> m_\\mathrm{e} v r = n \\hbar </math>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! [[Correspondence principle#Bohr model|How The Equation Was Derived:]]\n|-\n| If an electron in an atom is moving on an orbit with period ''T'', classically the electromagnetic radiation will repeat itself every orbital period. If the coupling to the electromagnetic field is weak, so that the orbit doesn't decay very much in one cycle, the radiation will be emitted in a pattern which repeats every period, so that the Fourier transform will have frequencies which are only multiples of 1/''T''. This is the classical radiation law: the frequencies emitted are integer multiples of 1/''T''.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, this emission must be in quanta of light, of frequencies consisting of integer multiples of 1/''T'', so that classical mechanics is an approximate description at large quantum numbers. This means that the energy level corresponding to a classical orbit of period 1/''T'' must have nearby energy levels which differ in energy by ''h/T'', and they should be equally spaced near that level,\n\n:<math>\n\\Delta E_n= { h\\over T(E_n) }.\n</math>\n\nBohr worried whether the energy spacing 1/''T'' should be best calculated with the period of the energy state <math>E_n</math>, or <math>E_{n+1}</math>, or some average\u2014in hindsight, this model is only the leading semiclassical approximation.\n\nBohr considered circular orbits. Classically, these orbits must decay to smaller circles when photons are emitted. The level spacing between circular orbits can be calculated with the correspondence formula. For a Hydrogen atom, the classical orbits have a period ''T'' determined by [[Keplers laws|Kepler's third law]] to scale as ''r''<sup>3/2</sup>. The energy scales as 1/''r'', so the level spacing formula amounts to\n\n:<math>\n\\Delta E \\propto { 1 \\over r^{3\\over 2} } \\propto E^{3 \\over 2}.\n</math>\nIt is possible to determine the energy levels by recursively stepping down orbit by orbit, but there is a shortcut.\n\nThe angular momentum ''L'' of the circular orbit scales as {{radic|''r''}}. The energy in terms of the angular momentum is then\n:<math>E \\propto {1\\over r} \\propto {1 \\over L^2}</math>.\nAssuming, with Bohr, that quantized values of ''L'' are equally spaced, the spacing between neighboring energies is\n:<math>\n\\Delta E \\propto {1 \\over (L+\\hbar)^2 } - {1 \\over L^2} \\approx - {2\\hbar \\over L^3} \\propto - E^{3 \\over 2}.\n</math>\nThis is as desired for equally spaced angular momenta. If one kept track of the constants, the spacing would be ''\u0127'', so the angular momentum should be an integer multiple of ''\u0127'',\n:<math>\nL = {nh \\over 2\\pi} = n \\hbar ~ .\n</math>\n\nThis is how Bohr arrived at his model.\n|}\n\n:Substituting the expression for the velocity gives an equation for ''r'' in terms of n:\n::<math> m_{\\text{e}}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{k_{\\text{e}}Ze^2}{m_{\\text{e}}r}}r=n\\hbar </math>\n:so that the allowed orbit radius at any n is:\n::<math> r_n = {n^2\\hbar^2\\over Zk_\\mathrm{e} e^2 m_\\mathrm{e}} </math>\n\n:The smallest possible value of ''r'' in the hydrogen atom (Z=1) is called the [[Bohr radius]] and is equal to:\n:: <math>r_1 = {\\hbar^2 \\over k_\\mathrm{e} e^2 m_\\mathrm{e}} \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{m} </math>\n\n:The energy of the ''n''-th level for any atom is determined by the radius and quantum number:\n::<math> E = -{Zk_\\mathrm{e} e^2 \\over 2r_n } = - { Z^2(k_\\mathrm{e} e^2)^2 m_\\mathrm{e} \\over 2\\hbar^2 n^2} \\approx {-13.6Z^2 \\over n^2}\\mathrm{eV} </math>\n\nAn electron in the lowest energy level of hydrogen ({{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1}}) therefore has about 13.6 [[electronvolt|eV]] less energy than a motionless electron infinitely far from the nucleus. The next energy level ({{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}) is \u22123.4 eV. The third (''n'' = 3) is \u22121.51 eV, and so on. For larger values of ''n'', these are also the binding energies of a highly excited atom with one electron in a large circular orbit around the rest of the atom. The hydrogen formula also coincides with the [[Wallis product]].<ref>[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2015/nov/17/revealing-the-hidden-connection-between-pi-and-bohrs-hydrogen-model \"Revealing the hidden connection between pi and Bohr's hydrogen model.\" Physics World (November 17, 2015)]</ref>\n\nThe combination of natural constants in the energy formula is called the Rydberg energy (''R''<sub>E</sub>):\n:<math> R_\\mathrm{E} = { (k_\\mathrm{e} e^2)^2 m_\\mathrm{e} \\over 2 \\hbar^2} </math>\n\nThis expression is clarified by interpreting it in combinations that form more [[natural units]]:\n: <math>\\, m_\\mathrm{e} c^2 </math> is the [[rest mass energy]] of the electron (511 keV)\n: <math>\\, {k_\\mathrm{e} e^2 \\over \\hbar c} = \\alpha \\approx {1\\over 137} </math> is the [[fine structure constant]]\n: <math>\\, R_\\mathrm{E} = {1\\over 2} (m_\\mathrm{e} c^2) \\alpha^2</math>\n\nSince this derivation is with the assumption that the nucleus is orbited by one electron, we can generalize this result by letting the nucleus have a charge ''q'' = ''Z e'' where ''Z'' is the [[atomic number]]. This will now give us energy levels for hydrogenic atoms, which can serve as a rough order-of-magnitude approximation of the actual energy levels. So for nuclei with ''Z'' protons, the energy levels are (to a rough approximation):\n:<math> E_n = -{Z^2 R_\\mathrm{E} \\over n^2} </math>\n\nThe actual energy levels cannot be solved analytically for more than one electron (see [[n-body problem|''n''-body problem]]) because the electrons are not only affected by the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] but also interact with each other via the [[Coulomb Force]].\n\nWhen ''Z'' = 1/''\u03b1'' (Z \u2248 137), the motion becomes highly relativistic, and ''Z''<sup>2</sup> cancels the ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup> in ''R''; the orbit energy begins to be comparable to rest energy. Sufficiently large nuclei, if they were stable, would reduce their charge by creating a bound electron from the vacuum, ejecting the positron to infinity. This is the theoretical phenomenon of electromagnetic charge screening which predicts a maximum nuclear charge. Emission of such positrons has been observed in the collisions of heavy ions to create temporary super-heavy nuclei.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nThe Bohr formula properly uses the [[reduced mass]] of electron and proton in all situations, instead of the mass of the electron,\n:<math>m_\\text{red} = \\frac{m_\\mathrm{e} m_\\mathrm{p}}{m_\\mathrm{e} + m_\\mathrm{p}} = m_\\mathrm{e} ~\\frac{1}{1+m_\\mathrm{e}/m_\\mathrm{p}}~.</math>\nHowever, these numbers are very nearly the same, due to the much larger mass of the proton, about 1836.1 times the mass of the electron, so that the reduced mass in the system is the mass of the electron multiplied by the constant 1836.1/(1+1836.1) = 0.99946. This fact was historically important in convincing Rutherford of the importance of Bohr's model, for it explained the fact that the frequencies of lines in the spectra for singly ionized helium do not differ from those of hydrogen by a factor of exactly 4, but rather by 4 times the ratio of the reduced mass for the hydrogen vs. the helium systems, which was much closer to the experimental ratio than exactly 4.\n\nFor positronium, the formula uses the [[reduced mass]] also, but in this case, it is exactly the electron mass divided by 2. For any value of the radius, the electron and the positron are each moving at half the speed around their common center of mass, and each has only one fourth the kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is half what it would be for a single electron moving around a heavy nucleus.\n:<math> E_n = {R_\\mathrm{E} \\over 2 n^2 } ~~~~~~ </math> (positronium)\n\n== Rydberg formula ==\n\nThe [[Rydberg formula]], which was known empirically before Bohr's formula, is seen in Bohr's theory as describing the energies of transitions or [[Atomic electron transition|quantum jumps]] between orbital energy levels. Bohr's formula gives the numerical value of the already-known and measured [[Rydberg's constant]], but in terms of more fundamental constants of nature, including the electron's charge and [[Planck's constant]].\n\nWhen the electron gets moved from its original energy level to a higher one, it then jumps back each level until it comes to the original position, which results in a [[photon]] being emitted. Using the derived formula for the different energy levels of hydrogen one may determine the wavelengths of light that a hydrogen atom can emit.\n\nThe energy of a photon emitted by a hydrogen atom is given by the difference of two hydrogen energy levels:\n::<math>E=E_i-E_f=R_\\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{1}{n_{f}^2} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}^2} \\right) \\,</math>\nwhere {{math|''n''<sub>''f''</sub>}} is the final energy level, and {{math|''n''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is the initial energy level.\n\nSince the energy of a [[photon]] is\n::<math>E=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}, \\,</math>\nthe wavelength of the photon given off is given by\n::<math>\\frac{1}{\\lambda}=R \\left( \\frac{1}{n_{f}^2} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}^2} \\right). \\,</math>\n\nThis is known as the [[Rydberg formula]], and the Rydberg constant {{math|''R''}} is {{math|''R''<sub>E</sub>/''hc''}}, or {{math|''R''<sub>E</sub>/2''\u03c0''}} in [[natural units]]. This formula was known in the nineteenth century to scientists studying [[spectroscopy]], but there was no theoretical explanation for this form or a theoretical prediction for the value of {{math|''R''}}, until Bohr. In fact, Bohr's derivation of the Rydberg constant, as well as the concomitant agreement of Bohr's formula with experimentally observed spectral lines of the [[Lyman series|Lyman]] ({{math|''n<sub>f</sub>''}} =1), [[Balmer series|Balmer]] ({{math|''n<sub>f</sub>''}} =2), and [[Paschen series|Paschen]] ({{math|''n<sub>f</sub>''}} =3) series, and successful theoretical prediction of other lines not yet observed, was one reason that his model was immediately accepted.\n\nTo apply to atoms with more than one electron, the Rydberg formula can be modified by replacing {{math|''Z''}} with {{math|''Z\u2212b''}} or {{math|''n''}} with {{math|''n\u2212b''}} where {{math|''b''}} is constant representing a screening effect due to the inner-shell and other electrons (see [[Electron shell]] and the later discussion of the \"Shell Model of the Atom\" below). This was established empirically before Bohr presented his model.\n\n== Shell model of heavier atoms ==\nBohr extended the model of hydrogen to give an approximate model for heavier atoms. This gave a physical picture that reproduced many known atomic properties for the first time.\n\nHeavier atoms have more protons in the nucleus, and more electrons to cancel the charge. Bohr's idea was that each discrete orbit could only hold a certain number of electrons. After that orbit is full, the next level would have to be used. This gives the atom a [[electron configuration|shell structure]], in which each shell corresponds to a Bohr orbit.\n\nThis model is even more approximate than the model of hydrogen, because it treats the electrons in each shell as non-interacting. But the repulsions of electrons are taken into account somewhat by the phenomenon of [[Shielding effect|screening]]. The electrons in outer orbits do not only orbit the nucleus, but they also move around the inner electrons, so the effective charge Z that they feel is reduced by the number of the electrons in the inner orbit.\n\nFor example, the lithium atom has two electrons in the lowest 1s orbit, and these orbit at Z=2. Each one sees the nuclear charge of Z=3 minus the screening effect of the other, which crudely reduces the nuclear charge by 1 unit. This means that the innermost electrons orbit at approximately 1/4 the Bohr radius. The outermost electron in lithium orbits at roughly Z=1, since the two inner electrons reduce the nuclear charge by 2. This outer electron should be at nearly one Bohr radius from the nucleus. Because the electrons strongly repel each other, the effective charge description is very approximate; the effective charge Z doesn't usually come out to be an integer. But [[Moseley's law]] experimentally probes the innermost pair of electrons, and shows that they do see a nuclear charge of approximately Z\u22121, while the outermost electron in an atom or ion with only one electron in the outermost shell orbits a core with effective charge Z\u2212k where k is the total number of electrons in the inner shells.\n\nThe shell model was able to qualitatively explain many of the mysterious properties of atoms which became codified in the late 19th century in the [[periodic table of the elements]]. One property was the size of atoms, which could be determined approximately by measuring the [[viscosity]] of gases and density of pure crystalline solids. Atoms tend to get smaller toward the right in the periodic table, and become much larger at the next line of the table. Atoms to the right of the table tend to gain electrons, while atoms to the left tend to lose them. Every element on the last column of the table is chemically inert ([[noble gas]]).\n\nIn the shell model, this phenomenon is explained by shell-filling. Successive atoms become smaller because they are filling orbits of the same size, until the orbit is full, at which point the next atom in the table has a loosely bound outer electron, causing it to expand. The first Bohr orbit is filled when it has two electrons, which explains why helium is inert. The second orbit allows eight electrons, and when it is full the atom is neon, again inert. The third orbital contains eight again, except that in the more correct Sommerfeld treatment (reproduced in modern quantum mechanics) there are extra \"d\" electrons. The third orbit may hold an extra 10 d electrons, but these positions are not filled until a few more orbitals from the next level are filled (filling the n=3 d orbitals produces the 10 [[transition elements]]). The irregular filling pattern is an effect of interactions between electrons, which are not taken into account in either the Bohr or Sommerfeld models and which are difficult to calculate even in the modern treatment.\n\n== Moseley's law and calculation of K-alpha X-ray emission lines ==\nNiels Bohr said in 1962, \"You see actually the Rutherford work was not taken seriously. We cannot understand today, but it was not taken seriously at all. There was no mention of it any place. The great change came from Moseley.\"\n\nIn 1913 [[Henry Moseley]] found an empirical relationship between the strongest X-ray line emitted by atoms under electron bombardment (then known as the [[K-alpha]] line), and their atomic number {{math|''Z''}}. Moseley's empiric formula was found to be derivable from Rydberg and Bohr's formula (Moseley actually mentions only [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Antonius Van den Broek]] in terms of models). The two additional assumptions that '''[1]''' this X-ray line came from a transition between energy levels with quantum numbers 1 and 2, and '''[2]''', that the atomic number {{math|''Z''}} when used in the formula for atoms heavier than hydrogen, should be diminished by 1, to {{math|(''Z''\u22121)<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nMoseley wrote to Bohr, puzzled about his results, but Bohr was not able to help. At that time, he thought that the postulated innermost \"K\" shell of electrons should have at least four electrons, not the two which would have neatly explained the result. So Moseley published his results without a theoretical explanation.\n\nLater, people realized that the effect was caused by charge screening, with an inner shell containing only 2 electrons. In the experiment, one of the innermost electrons in the atom is knocked out, leaving a vacancy in the lowest Bohr orbit, which contains a single remaining electron. This vacancy is then filled by an electron from the next orbit, which has n=2. But the n=2 electrons see an effective charge of Z\u22121, which is the value appropriate for the charge of the nucleus, when a single electron remains in the lowest Bohr orbit to screen the nuclear charge +Z, and lower it by \u22121 (due to the electron's negative charge screening the nuclear positive charge). The energy gained by an electron dropping from the second shell to the first gives [[Moseley's law]] for K-alpha lines,\n::<math>E= h\\nu = E_i-E_f=R_\\mathrm{E} (Z-1)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1^2} - \\frac{1}{2^2} \\right) \\,</math>\nor\n::<math>f = \\nu = R_\\mathrm{v} \\left( \\frac{3}{4}\\right) (Z-1)^2 = (2.46 \\times 10^{15} \\operatorname{Hz})(Z-1)^2.</math>\n\nHere, '''''R''<sub>v</sub>''' = '''''R''<sub>E</sub>/''h''''' is the Rydberg constant, in terms of frequency equal to 3.28 x 10<sup>15</sup> Hz. For values of Z between 11 and 31 this latter relationship had been empirically derived by Moseley, in a simple (linear) plot of the square root of X-ray frequency against atomic number (however, for silver, Z = 47, the experimentally obtained screening term should be replaced by 0.4). Notwithstanding its restricted validity,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=M.A.B.

[http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/Users/smithb/website/coursenotes/qi/QILectureNotes2.pdf#page=17 \"Quantum Ideas: Week 2\" Lecture Notes], p.17. University of Oxford. Retrieved Jan. 23, 2015.</ref> Although mental pictures fail somewhat at these levels of scale, an electron in the lowest modern \"orbital\" with no orbital momentum, may be thought of as not to rotate \"around\" the nucleus at all, but merely to go tightly around it in an ellipse with zero area (this may be pictured as \"back and forth\", without striking or interacting with the nucleus). This is only reproduced in a more sophisticated semiclassical treatment like Sommerfeld's. Still, even the most sophisticated semiclassical model fails to explain the fact that the lowest energy state is spherically symmetric \u2013 it doesn't point in any particular direction.\n\nNevertheless, in the modern [[Phase space formulation|''fully quantum treatment in phase space'']], the proper deformation (careful full extension) of the semi-classical result adjusts the angular momentum value to the correct effective one. As a consequence, the physical ground state expression is obtained through a shift of the vanishing quantum angular momentum expression, which corresponds to spherical symmetry.\n\nIn modern quantum mechanics, the electron in hydrogen is a [[Electron cloud|spherical cloud of probability]] that grows denser near the nucleus. The rate-constant of probability-decay in hydrogen is equal to the inverse of the Bohr radius, but since Bohr worked with circular orbits, not zero area ellipses, the fact that these two numbers exactly agree is considered a \"coincidence\". (However, many such coincidental agreements are found between the semiclassical vs. full quantum mechanical treatment of the atom; these include identical energy levels in the hydrogen atom and the derivation of a [[fine structure constant]], which arises from the relativistic Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld model (see below) and which happens to be equal to an entirely different concept, in full modern quantum mechanics).\n\nThe Bohr model also has difficulty with, or else fails to explain:\n\n* Much of the spectra of larger atoms. At best, it can make predictions about the [[K-alpha]] and some L-alpha X-ray emission spectra for larger atoms, if ''two'' additional ad hoc assumptions are made (see [[Moseley's law]] above). Emission spectra for atoms with a single outer-shell electron (atoms in the [[lithium]] group) can also be approximately predicted. Also, if the empiric electron\u2013nuclear screening factors for many atoms are known, many other spectral lines can be deduced from the information, in similar atoms of differing elements, via the Ritz\u2013Rydberg combination principles (see [[Rydberg formula]]). All these techniques essentially make use of Bohr's Newtonian energy-potential picture of the atom.\n* the relative intensities of spectral lines; although in some simple cases, Bohr's formula or modifications of it, was able to provide reasonable estimates (for example, calculations by Kramers for the [[Stark effect]]).\n* The existence of [[fine structure]] and [[hyperfine structure]] in spectral lines, which are known to be due to a variety of relativistic and subtle effects, as well as complications from electron spin.\n* The [[Zeeman effect]] \u2013 changes in spectral lines due to external [[magnetic field]]s; these are also due to more complicated quantum principles interacting with electron spin and orbital magnetic fields.\n* The model also violates the [[uncertainty principle]] in that it considers electrons to have known orbits and locations, two things which cannot be measured simultaneously.\n* Doublets and Triplets: Appear in the spectra of some atoms: Very close pairs of lines. Bohr\u2019s model cannot say why some energy levels should be very close together.\n* Multi-electron Atoms: don\u2019t have energy levels predicted by the model. It doesn\u2019t work for (neutral) helium.\n* A rotating charge, such as the electron classically orbiting around the nucleus, would constantly lose energy in form of electromagnetic radiation (via various mechanisms: [[dipole radiation]], [[Bremsstrahlung]],...). But such radiation is not observed.\n\n== Refinements ==\n[[Image:Sommerfeld ellipses.svg|thumb|Elliptical orbits with the same energy and quantized angular momentum]]\n\nSeveral enhancements to the Bohr model were proposed, most notably the '''[[Old quantum theory|Sommerfeld model]]''' or '''[[Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld theory|Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld model]]''', which suggested that electrons travel in elliptical orbits around a nucleus instead of the Bohr model's circular orbits.<ref name=\"Akhlesh Lakhtakia Ed. 1996\" /> This model supplemented the quantized angular momentum condition of the Bohr model with an additional radial quantization condition, the '''[[William Wilson (English academic)|Wilson]]\u2013[[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] quantization condition'''<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=A.

The integral is the [[Action (physics)|action]] of [[action-angle coordinates]]. This condition, suggested by the [[correspondence principle]], is the only one possible, since the quantum numbers are [[adiabatic invariant]]s.\n\nThe Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld model was fundamentally inconsistent and led to many paradoxes. The [[magnetic quantum number]] measured the tilt of the orbital plane relative to the ''xy''-plane, and it could only take a few discrete values. This contradicted the obvious fact that an atom could be turned this way and that relative to the coordinates without restriction. The Sommerfeld quantization can be performed in different canonical coordinates and sometimes gives different answers. The incorporation of radiation corrections was difficult, because it required finding action-angle coordinates for a combined radiation/atom system, which is difficult when the radiation is allowed to escape. The whole theory did not extend to non-integrable motions, which meant that many systems could not be treated even in principle. In the end, the model was replaced by the modern [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] treatment of the [[hydrogen atom]], which was first given by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in 1925, using [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]]. The current picture of the hydrogen atom is based on the [[atomic orbitals]] of [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] which [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] developed in 1926.\n\nHowever, this is not to say that the Bohr-Sommerfeld model was without its successes. Calculations based on the Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld model were able to accurately explain a number of more complex atomic spectral effects. For example, up to first-order [[Perturbation theory|perturbations]], the Bohr model and quantum mechanics make the same predictions for the spectral line splitting in the [[Stark effect]]. At higher-order perturbations, however, the Bohr model and quantum mechanics differ, and measurements of the Stark effect under high field strengths helped confirm the correctness of quantum mechanics over the Bohr model. The prevailing theory behind this difference lies in the shapes of the orbitals of the electrons, which vary according to the energy state of the electron.\n\nThe Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld quantization conditions lead to questions in modern mathematics. Consistent semiclassical quantization condition requires a certain type of structure on the phase space, which places topological limitations on the types of symplectic manifolds which can be quantized. In particular, the symplectic form should be the [[curvature form]] of a [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] of a [[Charles Hermite|Hermitian]] [[line bundle]], which is called a [[Geometric quantization|prequantization]].\n\n== See also ==\n{| <!--split as 2 columns on all browsers -->\n| valign=top |\n* [[1913 in science]]\n* [[Balmer's Constant]]\n* [[Basic concepts of quantum mechanics]]\n* [[Franck\u2013Hertz experiment]] provided early support for the Bohr model.{{nb5}}\n| valign=top |\n* [[Free-fall atomic model]]\n* [[Inert pair effect]] is adequately explained by means of the Bohr model.\n* [[Introduction to quantum mechanics]]\n* [[Theoretical and experimental justification for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{More footnotes|date=December 2008}}\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Primary sources ===\n\n* {{cite journal | author=Niels Bohr | title=On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules, Part I | journal=Philosophical Magazine | year=1913 | volume=26 | pages=1\u201324 | doi= 10.1080/14786441308634955| url=http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/bohr13/eng.pdf | issue=151}}\n* {{cite journal | author=Niels Bohr | title=On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules, Part II Systems Containing Only a Single Nucleus | journal=Philosophical Magazine | year=1913 | volume=26 | pages=476\u2013502 | url=http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/bohr13b/eng.pdf | doi=10.1080/14786441308634993 | issue=153}}\n* {{cite journal | author=Niels Bohr | title=On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules, Part III Systems containing several nuclei| journal=Philosophical Magazine | year=1913 | volume=26 | pages=857\u2013875 | doi=10.1080/14786441308635031}}\n* {{cite journal | author=Niels Bohr | title=The spectra of helium and hydrogen | journal=Nature | year=1914 | volume=92 | pages=231\u2013232 | doi=10.1038/092231d0|bibcode = 1913Natur..92..231B | issue=2295}}\n* {{cite journal | author=Niels Bohr | title=Atomic Structure | journal=Nature | year=1921 | volume=107 | pages=104\u2013107 | doi=10.1038/107104a0|bibcode = 1921Natur.107..104B | issue=2682 | url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Bohr-Nature-1921.html}}\n* {{cite journal | author=A.

In 1997 [[Diageo]] sold the brand to [[Bacardi]].<ref>http://www.grovesandwhitnall.co.uk/gj-distillers-warrington/</ref> Its name originates from the popularity of gin in [[Indian subcontinent|India]] during the [[British Raj]] and \"Sapphire\" refers to the violet-blue [[Star of Bombay]] on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref name=\"bacardilimited1\">[http://www.bacardilimited.com/our-brands/bombay-sapphire-gin Bombay Sapphire]</ref> Bombay Sapphire is marketed in a flat-sided, sapphire-coloured bottle that bears a picture of [[Queen Victoria]] on the label.<ref name=\"bacardilimited1\"/>\n\nThe flavouring of the drink comes from a recipe of ten ingredients: [[almond]], [[lemon]] peel, [[liquorice]], [[juniper berries]], [[orris root]], [[angelica]], [[coriander]], [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]], [[cubeb]], and [[Aframomum melegueta|grains of paradise]]. Alcohol brought in from another supplier is evaporated three times using a carterhead still, and the alcohol vapours are passed through a mesh/basket containing the ten botanicals, in order to gain flavour and aroma. This is felt to give the gin a lighter, more floral taste compared to those gins that are created using a copper [[pot still]]. Water from [[Lake Vyrnwy]] is added to bring the strength of Bombay Sapphire down to 40.0% (UK, Canada, Australia). The blue colour comes from the bottle, not the gin.\n\n==Production==\n\n[[File:Bombay Sapphire distillery, Laverstoke 01.jpg|thumb|[[Laverstoke Mill]]]]\n[[File:Thomas Heatherwick glasshouses for the Bombay Sapphire distillery 01.jpg|thumb|Glasshouses by [[Thomas Heatherwick]] for growing the botanicals]]\n2011, plans were announced to move the manufacturing process to a new facility at [[Laverstoke Mill]] in [[Whitchurch, Hampshire]], including the restoration of the former [[De La Rue|Portal]]'s paper mill at the proposed site, and the construction of a visitor centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/news/9025413.Gin_firm___s_tonic_for_historic_mill/ |title=Gin firm\u2019s tonic for historic mill (From Andover Advertiser) |publisher=Andoveradvertiser.co.uk |date=2011-05-13 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref> \n\nPlanning permission was granted in February 2012, and the centre opened to the public in the autumn of  2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gintime.com/news/gintime-lowdown-with-will-brix/|title=Gintime Lowdown with Will Brix|date=23 October 2013|work=gintime.com|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gintime.com/news/a-first-glimpse-of-the-bombay-sapphire-distillery/ A first glimpse of the Bombay Sapphire distillery] ''Gintime'' 19 September 2014,</ref> The visitor centre included a new construction by [[Thomas Heatherwick]] of two glasshouses for plants used as botanicals in the production of Bombay Sapphire gin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heatherwick.com/distillery/ |title=Bombay Sapphire Distillery, Laverstoke, UK |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Heatherwick Studio |publisher=Heatherwick Studio |access-date=5 November 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nProduction and bottling of the drink is contracted out by Bacardi to G&J Greenall.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Haffner |url=http://www.just-drinks.com/news/new-gj-greenall-owners-plot-marketing-drive-eye-acquisitions_id104668.aspx?lk=dm |title=G&J Greenall eyes acquisitions, plots ad spend |publisher=Just-drinks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>\n\n==Varieties==\nBacardi also markets '''Bombay Original London Dry Gin''' (or '''Bombay Original Dry'''). Eight botanical ingredients are used in the production of the Original Dry Gin variety as opposed to the ten in Bombay Sapphire. ''[[Wine Enthusiast Magazine|Wine Enthusiast]]'' preferred Bombay Sapphire.<ref>Bombay Original London Dry Gin listing on Proof66: http://www.proof66.com/gin/bombay-original-gin.html</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, '''Bombay Sapphire East''' was launched in test markets in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. This variety has another two botanicals, lemongrass and black peppercorns, in addition to the original ten. It is bottled at 42% and was designed to counteract the sweetness of American [[tonic water]].\n\nA Special edition of Bombay Gin called '''Star of Bombay''' was produced in 2015 for the UK Market. It is bottled at 47.5% and is distilled from grain.\n\n==Design connection==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}\nThe brand started a series of [[design]] collaborations. Their first step into the design world was a series of advertisements featuring work from currently popular designers. Their works, varying from [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]] glasses to tiles and cloth patterns, are labelled as \u201cInspired by Bombay Sapphire\u201d. The campaign featured designers such as [[Marcel Wanders]], [[Yves Behar]], [[Karim Rashid]], [[Ulla Darni]], and [[Dror Benshetrit]] and performance artist Jurgen Hahn.\n\nFrom the success of this campaign, the company began a series of events and sponsored locations. The best known is the Bombay Sapphire Designer Glass Competition, held each year, where design students from all over the world can participate by designing their own \u201cinspired\u201d martini cocktail glass. The finalists (one from each participating country) are then invited to the yearly Salone del Mobile, an international design fair in Milano, where the winner is chosen.\n\nBombay Sapphire also endorses glass artists and designers with the Bombay Sapphire Prize, which is awarded every year to an outstanding design which features glass. Bombay Sapphire also showcases the designers' work in the Bombay Sapphire endorsed blue room, which is a design exhibition touring the world each year.\n\nFrom 2008 the Bombay Sapphire Designer Glass Competition final will be held at 100% Design in London, UK and the Bombay Sapphire Prize will take place in Milan at the Salone Del Mobile.\n\n==Evaluation==\nBombay Sapphire has been reviewed by several outside [[spirit ratings]] organizations to mixed success.  Recently, it was awarded a score of 92 (on a 100-point scale) from the [[Beverage Testing Institute]].  Ratings aggregator Proof66.com categorizes the Sapphire as a Tier 2 spirit, indicating highly favourable \"expert\" reviews.<ref>Bombay Sapphire listing on Proof66: http://www.proof66.com/gin/bombay-sapphire.html</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}\n* Bombay Sapphire was used in the video work ''Victoria Day (Bombay Sapphire)'', 2002 by contemporary artists [[Marina Roy]] and Abbas Akhavan.\n* Long time sports radio personality [[Jim Rome]] is known for his love of Bombay Sapphire Gin, which he often refers to as \"the Magic Blue\".\n* American hip-hop artist Wiz Khalifa and his 'Taylor Gang' are also known  for their love of Bombay Sapphire dry gin\n* Former Las Vegas, Nevada Mayor Oscar Goodman is known for his love of Bombay Sapphire Gin, and has served as a spokesman for the brand.\n* American musician Robert Earl Keen references \"a quart of Bombay gin\" in the song \"The road goes on forever\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.bombaysapphire.com/ Bombay Sapphire Homepage]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708083617/http://www.boozebasher.com/2007-07-04/gin/review-bombay-sapphire-gin/ BoozeBasher review of Bombay Sapphire]\n*[http://www.designerglasscompetition.com/ Bombay Sapphire Designer Glass Competition]\n*[http://www.bombaysapphireprize.com/ Bombay Sapphire Prize]\n*[http://www.dfnionline.com/article/Bombay-Sapphire-sparkles-in-latest-collaboration-1856077.html Bombay Sapphire sparkles in latest collaboration]\n\n[[Category:Gins]]\n[[Category:Bacardi]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:English distilled drinks]]", "sha1": "8mqwlp7grtoizbg3ay15hvrs6w7wbqr"}}, {"title": "Bob Wills", "ns": "0", "id": "4833", "revision": {"id": "863307013", "parentid": "863306936", "timestamp": "2018-10-09T23:33:47Z", "contributor": {"ip": "65.129.110.47"}, "comment": "/* Later years */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Tone|date=February 2018}}\n\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = Bob Wills\n| image               = Bob Wills photograph - Cropped.jpg\n| image_size          =\n| caption             = Wills c. 1946\n| background          = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| birth_name          = James Robert Wills\n| alias               = \"King of Western Swing\"\n| birth_date          = {{birth date|1905|3|6}}\n| birth_place         = {{nowrap|[[Limestone County, Texas]], U.S.}}\n| origin              = \n| death_date          = {{death date and age|1975|5|13|1905|3|6}}\n| death_place         = [[Fort Worth, Texas]], U.S.\n| genre               = [[Western swing]]\n| years_active        = 1929\u20121969\n| label               = [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]], [[OKeh Records|OKeh]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[MGM Records|MGM]], [[Liberty Records|Liberty]]\n| associated_acts     = [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]], [[Light Crust Doughboys]], [[Texas Playboys]]\n| website             =\n}}\n[[File:BobWillsBlueYodelNo1.ogg|thumb|BobWillsBlueYodelNo1]]\n\n'''James Robert Wills''' (March 6, 1905 \u2013 May 13, 1975) was an American [[Western swing]] musician, songwriter, and bandleader.

The band played regularly on [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] radio station [[KFAQ|KVOO]] and added [[Leon McAuliffe]] on steel guitar, pianist Al Stricklin, drummer Smokey Dacus, and a horn section that expanded the band's sound. Wills favored jazz-like arrangements and the band found national popularity into the 1940s with such hits as \"[[Steel Guitar Rag]]\", \"[[New San Antonio Rose]]\", \"[[Smoke on the Water (Red Foley song)|Smoke On The Water]]\", \"[[Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jima|Stars And Stripes On Iwo Jima]]\", and \"[[New Spanish Two Step]]\".\n\nWills and the Texas Playboys recorded with several publishers and companies, including [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]], [[Okeh]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], and [[MGM]], frequently moving. In 1950, he had two Top 10 hits, \"Ida Red Likes The Boogie\" and \"[[Faded Love (Bob Wills song)|Faded Love]]\", which were his last hits for a decade. Throughout the 1950s, he struggled with poor health and tenuous finances, but continued to perform frequently despite the decline in popularity of his earlier music as rock and roll took over. Wills had a heart attack in 1962 and a second one the next year, which forced him to disband the Playboys although Wills continued to perform solo.\n\nThe [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] inducted Wills in 1968 and the [[Texas State Legislature]] honored him for his contribution to American music.<ref name=\"state1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/html/SC00035F.htm |title=82(R) SCR 35 \u2013 Enrolled version \u2013 Bill Text|publisher=Legis.state.tx.us|accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref> \n\nIn 1972, Wills accepted a citation from the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] in Nashville.

He alternated barbering and fiddling even when he moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] after leaving Hall County in 1929. There he played in [[minstrel show|minstrel]] and [[medicine show]]s, and, as with other Texas musicians such as Ocie Stockard, continued to earn money as a barber. He wore [[blackface]] makeup to appear in comedy routines, something that was common at the time. \"He was playing his violin and singing.\" There were two guitars and a banjo player with him. \"Bob was in blackface and was the comic; he cracked jokes, sang, and did an amazing jig dance.\"<ref name=\"Bob Wills 1976. page 45\">''San Antonio Rose: The Life And Music Of Bob Wills''.

One source for this was when, as a very young boy, he would hear his father, grandfather, and cowboys give out loud cries when the music moved them.<ref>''San Antonio Rose: The Life And Music Of Bob Wills''.

Brown left the band in 1932 to form the Musical Brownies, the first true [[Western swing]] band.

They left Waco in January 1934 for [[Oklahoma City]]. Wills soon settled the renamed Texas Playboys in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], and began broadcasting noontime shows over the 50,000 watt [[KFAQ|KVOO]] [[radio station]]. Their 12:30\u20131:15&nbsp;p.m. Monday\u2013Friday broadcasts became a veritable institution in the region. Nearly all of the daily (except Sunday) shows originated from the stage of [[Cain's Ballroom]]. In addition, they played dances in the evenings, including regular ones at the ballroom on Thursdays and Saturdays.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nWills added a trumpet to the band inadvertently when he hired Everet Stover as an announcer, not knowing that he had played with the New Orleans symphony and had directed the governor's band in Austin. Stover, thinking he had been hired as a trumpeter, began playing with the band with no comment from Wills. Young sax player Zeb McNally was allowed to play with the band, although Wills initially discouraged it. With two horns in the band, Wills realized he would have to add a drummer to balance things and create a fuller sound. He hired the young, \"modern style musician\" Smoky Dacus.<ref name=\"Hubbin 1995. pages 76, 80\">''Hubbin' It''. Ruth Sheldon. 1995.

He became an enormous draw in Los Angeles, where many of his Texas, Oklahoma and regional fans had also relocated during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] in search of jobs. Monday through Friday, the band broadcast from 12:01 to 1:00&nbsp;p.m. PT over KMTR-AM (now KLAC) in Los Angeles.

For a very brief period in 1944, the Wills band included 23 members,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> and around mid-year he toured Northern California and the Pacific Northwest with 21 pieces in the orchestra.<ref>''San Antonio Rose: The Life And Music Of Bob Wills''.

According to Opry policy, drums and horns were considered pop instruments, inappropriate to country music. The Opry had two western swing bands on its roster, led by [[Pee Wee King]] and [[Paul Howard (musician)|Paul Howard]]. Neither were allowed to use their drummers at the Opry.  Wills' band at the time consisted of two fiddlers, two bass fiddles, two electric guitars, electric steel guitar, and a trumpet. Wills's then-drummer was Monte Mountjoy, who played in the Dixieland style. Wills battled Opry officials and refused to perform without his drummer. An attempt to compromise by keeping Mountjoy behind a curtain collapsed when Wills had his drums placed front and center onstage at the last minute.<ref>''Southwest Shuffle: Pioneers Of Honky Tonk, Western Swing, And Country Jazz'' by Rich Kienzle p 255</ref>\n\nIn 1945, Wills' dances were outdrawing those of [[Tommy Dorsey]] and Benny Goodman,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> and he moved to [[Fresno, California]]. Then in 1947 he opened the Wills Point nightclub in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and continued touring the Southwest and Pacific Northwest from Texas to Washington State. While based in Sacramento, his radio broadcasts over 50,000-watt [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]] were heard all over the West.<ref>Gerald W. Haslam. ''Workin' Man Blues: Country Music In California''.

Because he was in such demand, some places booked Wills any time he had an opening, regardless of how undesirable the date. The manager of a popular auditorium in the LA Basin town of Wilmington, California: \"Although Monday night dancing is frankly an experiment it was the only night of the week on which this outstanding band could be secured.\"<ref name=\"Bob Wills 1976. page 241\"/>\n\nDuring the postwar period, [[KGO (AM)|KGO]] radio in [[San Francisco]] syndicated a Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys show recorded at the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]]. Many of these recordings survive today as the Tiffany Transcriptions and are available on [[Compact disc|CD]].<ref name=\"WSJ\"/> They show off the band's strengths significantly, in part because the group was not confined to the three-minute limits of 78 RPM discs. On April 3, 1948, Wills and the Texas Playboys appeared for the inaugural broadcast of the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' on [[KWKH]], broadcasting from the Municipal Auditorium in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].\n\nWills and the Texas Playboys played dances throughout the West to more than 10,000 people every week. They held dance attendance records at [[Jantzen Beach]] in Portland, Oregon; in Santa Monica, California, and at the Oakland (California) Auditorium, where they drew 19,000 people in two nights.<ref name=\"Bob Wills 1976. page 252\">''San Antonio Rose: The Life And Music Of Bob Wills''.

It ended when he fired Duncan in the fall of 1948.\n\n===Later years===\nHaving lived a lavish lifestyle in California, Wills moved back to Oklahoma City in 1949, then went back on the road to maintain his payroll and Wills Point. He opened a second club, the Bob Wills Ranch House in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. Turning the club over to managers later revealed to be dishonest left Wills in desperate financial straits with heavy debts to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] for back [[tax]]es that caused him to sell many assets including, mistakenly, the rights to \"New San Antonio Rose\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} It wrecked him financially.\n\nIn 1950, Wills had two Top 10 hits, \"Ida Red Likes The Boogie\" and \"[[Faded Love (Bob Wills song)|Faded Love]]\". After 1950, radio stations began to increasingly specialize in one form or another of commercially popular music. Wills did not fit into the popular Nashville country and western stations, although he was usually labeled \"country and western\". Neither did he fit into the pop or middle of the road stations, although he played a good deal of pop music, and was not accepted in the pop music world.<ref>''San Antonio Rose: The Life And Music Of Bob Wills''. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 281. {{ISBN|0-252-00470-1}}.</ref>\n\nHe continued to tour and record through the 1950s into the early 1960s, despite the fact that Western swing's popularity, even in the Southwest, had greatly diminished. Bob could draw \"a thousand people on Monday night between 1950 and 1952, but he could not do that by 1956. Entertainment habits had changed.\"<ref>''San Antonio Rose: The Life And Music Of Bob Wills''. Charles R. Townsend. 1976.

The article quotes Wills as saying, \"Rock and Roll? Why, man, that's the same kind of music we've been playin' since 1928!&nbsp;... We didn't call it rock and roll back when we introduced it as our style back in 1928, and we don't call it rock and roll the way we play it now. But it's just basic rhythm and has gone by a lot of different names in my time. It's the same, whether you just follow a drum beat like in Africa or surround it with a lot of instruments.

He appeared twice on ABC-TV's ''[[Jubilee USA (TV series)|Jubilee USA]]'' and kept the band on the road into the 1960s. After two heart attacks, in 1965 he dissolved the Texas Playboys (who briefly continued as an independent unit) to perform solo with house bands. While he did well in Las Vegas and other areas, and made records for the [[Kapp Records]] label, he was largely a forgotten figure\u2014even though inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1968. A 1969 stroke left his right side paralyzed, ending his active career.  He did, however, recover sufficiently to appear in a wheelchair at various Wills tributes held in the early 70's. A revival of interest in his music, spurred by [[Merle Haggard]]'s 1970 album [[A Tribute To the Best Damn Fiddle Player In The World]], led to a 1973 reunion album, teaming Wills, who could only speak with difficulty, with key members of the early band, as well as Haggard. \n\nMay 26, 1975 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' (Milestones section) read: \"Died.

A 1970 [[tribute album]] by Haggard [[A_Tribute_to_the_Best_Damn_Fiddle_Player_in_the_World (or,_My_Salute_to_Bob_Wills)]] directed a wider audience to Wills' music, as did the appearance of younger \"revival\" bands like [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]] plus the growing popularity of longtime Wills disciple and fan [[Willie Nelson]]. By 1971, Wills recovered sufficiently to travel occasionally and appear at tribute concerts. In 1973 he participated in a final reunion session with members of some the Texas Playboys from the 1930s to the 1960s. Merle Haggard was invited to play at this reunion. The session, scheduled for two days, took place in December 1973, with the album to be titled ''For The Last Time''. Wills, speaking or attempting to holler, appeared on a couple tracks from the first day's session but suffered a stroke overnight. He had a more severe one a few days later. The musicians completed the album without him. Wills by then was comatose. He lingered until his death on May 13, 1975.\n\nIn addition to being inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1968,<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/1999/05/11/ent_swings.shtml#.VX3mK09VjME |title=Wills swings into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame &#124; Amarillo.com &#124; Amarillo Globe-News |publisher=Amarillo.com |date=1999-05-11 |accessdate=2015-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123161921/http://amarillo.com/stories/1999/05/11/ent_swings.shtml#.VX3mK09VjME |archive-date=November 23, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Wills was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970, the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in the Early Influence category along with the Texas Playboys in 1999, and received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2007.\n\nFrom 1974 until his 2002 death, [[Waylon Jennings]] performed a song he had written called \"[[Bob Wills Is Still The King]]\". Released as the B-side of a single that was a double-sided hit, it went to number one on the country charts.  The song has become a staple of [[classic country]] radio station formats.  In addition, [[The Rolling Stones]] performed this song live in [[Austin, Texas]] at [[Zilker Park]] on their [[A Bigger Bang Tour]], a shout-out to Wills.  This performance was included on their subsequent DVD ''[[The Biggest Bang]]''. In a 1968 issue of ''Guitar Player'', rock guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] said of Wills and the Playboys: \"I dig them. The Grand Ole Opry used to come on, and I used to watch that.  They used to have some pretty heavy cats, some heavy guitar players.\"  In fact, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys only performed on the Opry twice: in 1944 and 1948.  Hendrix almost surely referred to Nashville guitarists.\n\nWills ranked #27 in ''[[Country Music Television|CMT's]] 40 Greatest Men In Country Music'' in 2003.\n\nWills' upbeat 1938 song [[Ida Red]] was Chuck Berry's primary inspiration for creating his first [[Rock and Roll]] hit - [[Maybellene]].\n\n[[Fats Domino]] once remarked that he patterned his 1960 rhythm section after that of Bob Wills.<ref>''San Antonio Rose: The Life And Music Of Bob Wills''.

His mother, Rikkat Uyan\u0131k, was a famous singer in the early 1940s. His older brother, who was born during [[World War II]], was named Sava\u015f (\"war\" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) while he was named Bar\u0131\u015f (\"peace\" in Turkish) by his parents to celebrate the end of the war. At birth, he was additionally named Tosun Yusuf after his deceased uncle Yusuf called Tosun (literally: Joseph the Sturdy). However, this name was erased just before he attended the primary school.<ref name=\"h1\"/> Man\u00e7o is of partial [[Albanians|Albanian]] descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haksozhaber.net/arnavut-her-yerde-arnavuttur-21826yy.htm|title=\tarnavut-her-yerde-arnavuttur|date=2011-07-12|accessdate=2018-10-05}}</ref>\n\nIn primary school his head was shaven to prevent [[head lice]], a serious threat back then, which he cited among reasons for his later signature long hair.\n\nDuring his highschool days in [[Galatasaray High School]] (and later in \u015ei\u015fli Terakki High School) he formed his first band, '''Kafadarlar''' (\"The Buddies\"), allegedly upon seeing [[Erkin Koray]]'s band performing, all students of [[Deutsche Schule Istanbul]] (''\u0130stanbul Alman Lisesi''), a nearby highschool. Prof. Dr. Asaf Sava\u015f Akat, a famous economist in Turkey, played [[saxophone]], and [[guitarist]] Ender En\u00f6n made his own guitar because it was difficult to find a real one on the market in those years.\n\nIn 1962 and 1963, with his next band, '''Harmoniler''' (\"The Harmonies\"), he recorded cover versions of some of popular American [[Twist (dance)|twist]] songs and rearrangements of Turkish folk songs in [[rock and roll]] form, marking the beginning of the [[Anatolian rock]] movement, a synthesis of [[Turkish folk music]] and [[rock music|rock]]. In this period, his key visual and musical influence was [[Elvis Presley]].\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1963, he moved to Europe, travelling around [[Paris]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], where he formed bands with local musicians and recorded some singles mainly in English and in French but also in Turkish. Then, in 1964, Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o continued his studies at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. He toured with his band '''Les Mistigris''' (not related to [[Mistigris]]) in [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[France]] and [[Turkey]] until 1967.\n\nIn 1967, he suffered a serious car accident, after which he started to grow his signature mustache to disguise his scar.\n\nFrustrated by the difficulties of working with musicians from different nationalities, he formed '''Kayg\u0131s\u0131zlar''' (The Carefrees), featuring [[Mazhar Alanson]] and [[Fuat G\u00fcner]], future members of the band [[MF\u00d6]]. He recorded several singles and toured with the band, both domestically and internationally, until the band members revealed that they did not want to live abroad.\n\nIn 1970, he formed '''Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o Ve ... ''' (\"Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o and ...\") again with foreign musicians, to record his first hit single, both in Turkey and in Belgium, ''Da\u011flar Da\u011flar'' (Mountains, Mountains!), selling over 700,000 copies. Today, the song remains one of his most popular works.\n\n== 1970s ==\nAfter the success of \"Da\u011flar Da\u011flar\", Man\u00e7o recorded a couple of singles with [[Mo\u011follar]] (The Mongols), another influential Turkish Anatolian rock band. He then decided to return to Turkey where he recorded with the reformed Kayg\u0131s\u0131zlar for a short period. In 1971, his early works were compiled under his first full-length album ''D\u00fcnden Bug\u00fcne'', today commonly referred as ''Da\u011flar Da\u011flar''.\n\nIn 1972, he formed [[Kurtalan Ekspres]], a legend by itself, the band that would accompany him until his death. In 1975 until when he continued to release singles, he released his first non-compilation LP ''2023'', a [[concept album]] that includes many instrumental songs.\n\nAs a last attempt to reach international success, he released the LP titled ''Baris Mancho'' (1976), a strange transcription of his name, mostly with '''George Hayes Orchestra''' under [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] label, in Europe and South Africa. Although the album did not bring the fame he was expecting, it did reach the top of the charts in [[Romania]] and [[Morocco]]. The following year, the album was released in Turkey under the title ''Nick the Chopper''.  In 1975 he starred in the movie Baba Bize Eversene (Father make us marry) which is the only movie he ever starred during his career. The music of the movie consists of a compilation of tracks composed by Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o and Kurtalan Ekspres.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1980, he released three more albums in Turkey, partly consisting of compilations of older singles, namely ''Sakla Saman\u0131 Gelir Zaman\u0131'' (1977), ''Yeni Bir G\u00fcn'' (1979) and ''20. Sanat Y\u0131l\u0131 Disko Man\u00e7o'' (1980), all following a similar sound with ''2023''. All these albums are now rarity items, but most of the material from the era are available in later compilations ''Ben Bilirim'' and ''Sar\u0131 \u00c7izmeli Mehmet A\u011fa''.\n\n== 1980s ==\nIn 1981, Man\u00e7o released ''S\u00f6z\u00fcm Meclisten D\u0131\u015far\u0131'' with Kurtalan Ekspres, containing many hit songs including \"Alla Beni Pulla Beni\", \"Arkada\u015f\u0131m E\u015fek\", \"G\u00fclpembe\", \"Halhal\" and \"D\u00f6nence\" among others. The album remains as one of their most popular works and launched a boost of popularity for Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o during the 1980s.\n\n\"Arkada\u015f\u0131m E\u015fek\" (\"My Friend Donkey\"), quickly grew very popular among children (the song is about rural nostalgia and was not initially intended as a children's song).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Throughout his career, he went on to write many other songs primarily for children to achieve an iconic acceptance among Turkish children of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nOn the other hand, \"G\u00fclpembe\", composed by Kurtalan Ekspres bassist Ahmet G\u00fcven\u00e7, a requiem for Man\u00e7o's grandmother, caught older audiences and probably is the artist's most popular song, competing perhaps only with \"Da\u011flar Da\u011flar\".\n\nIn 1983, ''Esta\u011ffurullah, Ne Haddimize'' was released. It contained hit songs \"Halil \u0130brahim Sofras\u0131\" and \"Kol D\u00fc\u011fmeleri\", a new version of the artist's first song. \"Halil \u0130brahim Sofras\u0131\" exemplified Man\u00e7o's signature moral themed lyrics, a rare feature in [[Turkish pop music]].\n\nIn 1985, ''24 Ayar Man\u00e7o'' which included \"Gibi Gibi\" and a long conceptual song \"Lahburger\" was released. It also marked the beginning of the shift in Man\u00e7o's sound characterized with the heavy use of [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]] in contrast with his older works consisting of a group oriented rock based sound. In subsequent years, Man\u00e7o released ''De\u011fmesin Ya\u011fl\u0131 Boya'' (1986), ''Sahibinden \u0130htiya\u00e7tan'' (1988) and ''Dar\u0131s\u0131 Ba\u015f\u0131n\u0131za'' (1989), all containing a couple of hit songs and demonstrating his new sound.\n\n== ''7'den 77'ye'' and 1990s ==\n[[File:Erkan Umut & Baris Manco in Mexico 1998.jpg|thumb|right|Cameraman Erkan Umut and Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o in [[Teotihuacan]], [[Mexico]] in 1998.]]\n[[File:Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o museum01.JPG|thumb|right|Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o Museum.]]\n\nIn 1988, ''7'den 77'ye'' (''From 7 to 77''), a TV show directed and presented by Man\u00e7o, began to run on [[TRT 1]], the Turkish state television channel. It was a combined music, talk show, and documentary program which was a major hit during the eight years it stayed on air. Man\u00e7o traveled to almost 150 countries for the show. \"Adam Olacak \u00c7ocuk\", a section of his show dedicated to children, strengthened Man\u00e7o's popularity among the young generations.\n\nAlthough his fame continued in the 1990s thanks to the wide audience of his TV show, which was followed by all age groups, his musical works in this period were not as successful as those in the previous decades. The albums ''Mega Man\u00e7o'' (1992) and ''M\u00fcsadenizle \u00c7ocuklar'' (1995) were considered the weakest efforts of his career, despite the limited success of the 1992 children hit ''Ay\u0131'' (The Bear). On the other hand, in 1995 he toured in [[Japan]] with Kurtalan Ekspres, leading to ''Live In Japan'' (1996), his only live album. He released two albums in that country with some recognition as \"the man who writes songs about vegetables\", referring to \"Domates, Biber, Patl\u0131can\" (\"Tomato, Pepper, Aubergine\") and \"Nane, Limon Kabu\u011fu\" (Mint, Lemon Rind), two of his hit songs from the 1980s.\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Kanl\u0131caCemetery (6).jpg|thumb|The grave of Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o at [[Kanl\u0131ca Cemetery]] in [[Kanl\u0131ca]], [[Istanbul Province|Istanbul]]. ]]\n\nOn 31 January 1999, Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o died of a sudden heart attack before the release of his just finished last work ''Man\u00e7oloji'' (''Man\u00e7ology'' or ''Manchology'') (1999), a double album containing the new recordings of his hit songs along with an unfinished instrumental song \"40. Y\u0131l\" (\"The 40th Anniversary\"), celebrating his 40th year in music. His sudden death caused an almost unanimous shock in Turkey with millions of people mourning and tens of thousands of people attending his funeral.\n\nHe was interred at [[Kanl\u0131ca Cemetery]] in [[Istanbul]].<ref name=\"cha1\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nBar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o was one of the most influential Turkish musicians. In his early career he and his bands contributed to the [[Turkish rock]] movement by combining traditional Turkish music with [[rock music|rock]] influences, which is still one of the main trends of Turkish popular music.\n\nHis visual image, characterized by his long hair, mustache and big rings, softened the reaction of the otherwise conservative Turkish public opinion.\n\nMan\u00e7o pioneered the [[progressive rock]]-influenced [[Anatolian rock]] movement in the 1970s. His experimentation with electronic instruments in the late 1980s contributed to the 1990s sound of Turkish popular music.\n\nHis lyrics with diverse themes, mostly following a somewhat modernized version of the \"a\u015f\u0131k\" (wandering folk poets) tradition were heavily marginal in the popular music scene of the 1980s which was mostly dominated by love-themed lyrics.\n\nIn 2002, a tribute album was released under the name ''Y\u00fcre\u011fimdeki Bar\u0131\u015f \u015eark\u0131lar\u0131'' (\"Songs of Bar\u0131\u015f (Peace) In My Heart\"), featuring 15 popular Turkish artists of such diverse genres like [[arabesque music|arabesque]], pop and rock (both Anatolian and western style) demonstrating his wide range of influence.\n\n[[File:Manco Kosk Baris Manco.jpg|thumb|[[Wax sculpture]] of Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o at his house (''Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o Evi'') in the Moda quarter of Istanbul, today a museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barismanco.kadikoy.bel.tr/|title=Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o House Museum}}</ref>]]\n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Albums ===\n* D\u00fcnden Bug\u00fcne (1972) (Sayan)\n* 2023 (1975) (Yavuz Plak)\n* Sakla Saman\u0131 Gelir Zaman\u0131 (1976) (Yavuz)\n* Baris Mancho, released as Nick The Chopper in Turkey (1976) (CBS Disques/Grammofoonplaten S.A.B.V., CBS 81784, Yavuz LP)\n* Yeni Bir G\u00fcn (1979) (Yavuz ve Bur\u00e7 Plak\u00e7\u0131l\u0131k)\n* 20 Sanat Y\u0131l\u0131 Disco Man\u00e7o (1980) (T\u00fcrk\u00fcola)\n* S\u00f6z\u00fcm Meclisten D\u0131\u015far\u0131 (1981) (T\u00fcrk\u00fcola)\n* Esta\u011ffurullah ...

devised by [[New Zealand]]-based developer Mark Sibly. Being derived from [[BASIC]], Blitz syntax was designed to be easy to pick up for beginners first learning to program.  The languages are game-programming oriented but are often found general-purpose enough to be used for most types of application. The Blitz language evolved as new products were released, with recent incarnations offering support for more advanced programming techniques such as [[object-oriented programming|object-orientation]] and [[Multithreading (software)|multi-threading]].  This led to the languages losing their BASIC moniker in later years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blitzbasic.com|title=The Official Blitz Website|website=www.blitzbasic.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331013346/http://www.blitzbasic.com/|archivedate=31 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first iteration of the Blitz language was created for the [[Amiga]] platform and published by the [[Australia]]n firm Memory and Storage Technology.  Returning to [[New Zealand]], Blitz BASIC 2 was published several years later by Acid Software (a local Amiga game publisher).  Since then, Blitz compilers have been released on several [[Platform (computing)|platforms]]. Following the demise of the Amiga as a commercially viable platform, the Blitz BASIC 2 source code was released to the Amiga community. Development continues to this day under the name AmiBlitz.\n\n=== BlitzBasic ===\n[[Idigicon]] published BlitzBasic for [[Microsoft Windows]] in October 2000.  The language included a built-in API for performing basic 2D graphics and audio operations. Following the release of Blitz3D, BlitzBasic is often synonymously referred to as Blitz2D.\n\nRecognition of BlitzBasic increased when a limited range of \"free\" versions were distributed in popular UK computer magazines such as [[PC Format]]. This resulted in a legal dispute between the developer and publisher which was eventually resolved amicably.\n\n=== BlitzPlus ===\nIn February 2003, Blitz Research Ltd. released BlitzPlus also for Microsoft Windows. It lacked the 3D engine of Blitz3D, but did bring new features to the 2D side of the language by implementing limited Microsoft Windows control support for creating native [[GUI]]s.  Backwards compatibility of the 2D engine was also extended, allowing compiled BlitzPlus games and applications to run on systems that might only have [[DirectX]] 1.\n\n=== BlitzMax ===\n{{Infobox programming language\n| name                   = BlitzMax\n| logo                   =\n| paradigm               = [[imperative programming|imperative]], [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], [[modular programming|modular]], [[reflection (computer science)|reflective]]\n| year                   = 2004\n| designer               = Mark Sibly\n| developer              = [https://web.archive.org/web/20160331013346/http://www.blitzbasic.com/ Blitz Research Ltd.]\n| discontinued = Yes\n| latest release version = 1.51\n| latest release date    = {{release date and age|df=yes|2015|09|21}}\n| typing                 = [[static typing|Static]], [[weak typing|Weak]], [[strong typing|Strong]] (Optional)\n| implementations        =\n| dialects               =Official BlitzMax, bmx-ng\n| influenced_by          = BlitzBasic\n| influenced             = [[Monkey (programming language)|Monkey]]\n| operating_system       = [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]]\n}}\n\nThe first BlitzMax compiler was released in December 2004 for [[Mac OS X]]. This made it the first Blitz dialect that could be compiled on *nix platforms. Compilers for Microsoft Windows and [[Linux]] were subsequently released in May 2005. BlitzMax brought the largest change of language structure to the modern range of Blitz products by extending the type system to include object-oriented concepts and modifying the graphics API to better suit [[OpenGL]]. BlitzMax was also the first of the Blitz languages to represent strings internally using [[UCS2]], allowing native-support for string literals composed of non-[[ASCII]] characters.\n\nBlitzMax's platform-agnostic command-set allows developers to compile and run source code on multiple platforms. However the official compiler and build chain will only generate binaries for the platform that it is executing on. Unofficially, users have been able to get Linux and Mac OS X to cross-compile to the Windows platform.\n\nBlitzMax is also the first [[modularity (programming)|modular]] version of the Blitz languages, improving the extensibility of the command-set. In addition, all of the standard modules shipped with the compiler are open-source and so can be tweaked and recompiled by the programmer if necessary. The official BlitzMax [[cross-platform]] [[GUI]] module (known as MaxGUI) allows developers to write GUI interfaces for their applications on Linux ([[FLTK]]), Mac ([[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]]) and Windows. Various user-contributed modules extend the use of the language by wrapping such libraries as [[wxWidgets]], [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]], and [[Fontconfig]] as well as a selection of database modules. There are also a selection of third-party 3D modules available namely MiniB3D<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/topics.php?forum=119|title=Blitz News|website=www.blitzbasic.com|access-date=12 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126114117/http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/topics.php?forum=119|archive-date=26 January 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> - an open-source OpenGL engine which can be compiled and used on all three of BlitzMax's supported platforms.\n\nIn October 2007, BlitzMax 1.26 was released which included the addition of a [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]] module.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=72891#814878|title=BlitzMax update 1.26 now available!|website=www.blitzbasic.com|access-date=11 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526130312/http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=72891#814878|archive-date=26 May 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  BlitzMax 1.32 shipped new [[thread (computer science)|threading]] and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] scripting modules and most of the standard library functions have been updated so that they are [[unicode]] friendly.<ref>[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=83917#947391 BlitzMax V132 for Windows and MacIntel now up!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526130325/http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=83917#947391 |date=26 May 2011 }} on blitzbasic.com</ref>\n\n=== Blitz3D SDK ===\nBlitz3D SDK is a 3D graphics engine based on the engine in Blitz3D. It was marketed for use with [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], BlitzMax and [[PureBasic]], however it could also be used with other languages that follow compatible calling conventions. A game example for Blitz3d is [[SCP \u2013 Containment Breach]] which was made with Blitz3d\n\n=== Max3D module ===\nIn 2008, the source code to Max3D - a C++-based cross-platform 3D engine - was released under a [[BSD license]]. This engine focused on OpenGL but had an abstract backend for other graphics drivers (such as DirectX) and made use of several open-source libraries, namely [[Assimp]], [[Boost C++ Libraries|Boost]] and [[Open Dynamics Engine|ODE]].\n\nDespite the excitement in the Blitz community of Max3D being the eagerly awaited successor to Blitz3D, interest and support died off soon after the source code was released and eventually development came to a halt. There is no indication that Blitz Research will pick up the project again.\n\n=== Open-source release ===\nBlitzPlus was released as [[Open Source]] on 28 April 2014 under the [[zlib license]] on [[github.com]].<ref>[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Home/_index_.php BlitzPlus Source Code Released] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716133612/http://www.blitzbasic.com/Home/_index_.php |date=16 July 2016 }} by simonh (2014-04-29)</ref><ref>[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=102907 Blitz3D open sourced!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906075242/http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=102907 |date=6 September 2016 }} on Blitz3D Forums by (2014)</ref> Blitz3D followed soon after and was released as Open Source on 3 August 2014.<ref>[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Home/_index_.php Blitz3D Now Free and Open Source!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716133612/http://www.blitzbasic.com/Home/_index_.php |date=16 July 2016 }} by simonh (2014-08-03)</ref><ref>[https://github.com/blitz-research/blitz3d blitz3d] on github.com</ref> BlitzMax was later released as Open Source on 21 September 2015.<ref>[https://github.com/blitz-research/blitzmax blitzmax] on github.com</ref>\n\n==Sample code==\nThe following code creates a windowed application that shows the current time in binary and decimal format.

Bliss]] (1870\u20131955) and published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953. Although originally devised in the [[United States]], it was more commonly adopted by [[United Kingdom|British]] libraries.<ref name=\":2\">List of libraries using Bliss Classification. http://www.blissclassification.org.uk/bclink.shtml</ref> A second edition of the system (BC2) has been in ongoing development in Britain since 1977.\n\n==Origins of the system==\nHenry E. Bliss began working on the Bliss Classification system while working at the [[City College of New York|City College of New York Library]] as Assistant Librarian.<ref name=\":0\" /> He was a critic of [[Melvil Dewey]]'s work with the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]] and believed that organization of titles needed to be done with an intellectual mind frame. Being overly pragmatic or simply alphabetical, would be inadequate. In fact, Bliss is the only theorist who created an organizational scheme based on societal needs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broughton|first=Vanda|date=2008|title=Henry Evelyn Bliss \u2013 the other immortal, or a prophet without honour?|url=|journal=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|doi=10.1177/0961000607086620|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Bliss wanted a classification system that would provide distinct rules yet still be adaptable to whatever kind of collection a library might have, as different libraries have different needs. His solution was the concept of \"alternative location,\" in which a particular subject could be put in more than one place, as long as the library made a specific choice and used it consistently.\n\nBliss discusses his theories and basis of organization for the Bliss Classification for the first time in his 1910 article, \"A Modern Classification for Libraries, with Simple Notation, Mnemonics, and Alternatives\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Bliss|first=Henry E.|date=August 1910|title=A Modern Classification for Libraries, with Simple Notation, Mnemonics, and Alternatives|url=|journal=Library Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> This publication followed his 1908 reclassification of the City College collection. His work, ''Organization of Knowledge and the System of the Sciences'' was published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.blissclassification.org.uk/bchist.shtml|title=Bliss Classification Association : BC2 : History & description|website=www.blissclassification.org.uk|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe four broad underlying policies of the BC system are:<ref name=\":1\" /> \n* alternative location \n* brief, concise notation \n* organizing knowledge according to academic expertise \n* subjects moving gradually from topic to topic as they naturally related to one another.\nBliss deliberately avoided the use of the [[decimal separator|decimal point]] because of his objection to Dewey's system. Instead he used capital and lower-case letters, numerals, and every typographical symbol available on his extensive and somewhat eccentric [[typewriter]].\n\n==Adoption and change to BC2==\nIn 1967 the Bliss Classification Association was formed. Its first publication was the Abridged Bliss Classification (ABC), intended for school libraries. In 1977 it began to publish and maintain a revised version of Bliss's system, the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (Second Edition) or BC2. This retains only the broad outlines of Bliss's scheme, replacing most of the detailed notation with a new scheme based on the principles of [[faceted classification]]. 15 of approximately 28 volumes of schedules have so far been published. A revision of this nature has been considered by some to be a completely new system.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe City College library continued to use Bliss's system until 1967, when it switched to the [[Library of Congress]] system. It had become too expensive to train new staff members to use BC, and too expensive to maintain in general. Much of the Bliss stacks remain, however, as no-one has re-cataloged the books.\n\nThe case was different, however, in Britain. BC proved more popular there and also spread to other English-speaking countries. Part of the reason for its success was that libraries in teachers\u2019 colleges liked the way Bliss had organized the subject areas on teaching and education. By the mid-1950s the system was being used in at least sixty British libraries and in a hundred by the 1970s The Bliss Classification system has been found to be successful in academic, specialty, government, and law libraries. It has also found success in libraries outside of the United States of America, as many of these libraries do not have a history of using either the Dewey Decimal, or the Library of Congress classification system.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Bliss Classification system has been found to be successful in academic, specialty, government, and law libraries.

This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when women consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours.<ref name=\"cdc.gov\">\"Quick Stats: Binge Drinking.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. April 2008.[https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/quickstats/binge_drinking.htm].</ref>\n\n== Units of measurement ==\nThere are several different units in use around the world for defining blood alcohol concentration. Each is defined as either a mass of alcohol per volume of blood or a mass of alcohol per mass of blood (never a volume per volume). 1 milliliter of blood has a mass of approximately 1.06&nbsp;grams. Because of this, units by volume are similar but not identical to units by mass. In the U.S. the concentration unit 1% w/v (percent mass/volume, equivalent to 10&nbsp;g/l or 1&nbsp;g per 100&nbsp;ml) is in use. This is not to be confused with the amount of alcohol measured on the breath, as with a [[breathalyzer]]. The amount of alcohol measured on the breath is generally accepted as proportional to the amount of alcohol present in the blood at a rate of 1:2100. Therefore, a breathalyzer measurement of 0.10&nbsp;mg/L of breath alcohol converts to 0.0001\u00d72100 g/10dL, or 0.021 g/dL of blood alcohol (the units of the BAC in the United States). While a variety of units (or sometimes lack thereof) is used throughout the world, many countries use the g/L unit, which does not create confusion as percentages do. Usual units are highlighted in the table below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! Reference !! Unit !! Dimensions !! Equivalent to !!

Although the degree of impairment may vary among individuals with the same blood alcohol content, it can be measured objectively and is therefore legally useful and difficult to contest in court. Most countries disallow operation of motor vehicles and heavy machinery above prescribed levels of blood alcohol content. Operation of boats and aircraft is also regulated.\n\nThe alcohol level at which a person is considered legally impaired varies by country. The list below gives limits by country.

For example, on average the ratio of blood alcohol content to breath alcohol content (the ''partition ratio'') is 2100 to 1. In other words, there are 2100 parts of alcohol in the blood for every part in the breath. However, the actual ratio in any given individual can vary from 1300:1 to 3100:1, or even more widely.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Significance of variations in blood: breath partition coefficient of alcohol.| pmc=1689868 | pmid=793681|volume=2|year=1976|pages=1479\u201381|vauthors=Alobaidi TA, Hill DW, Payne JP |journal=Br Med J|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.6050.1479}}</ref>  This ratio varies not only from person to person, but within one person from moment to moment.  Thus a person with a true blood alcohol level of .08% but a partition ratio of 1700:1 at the time of testing would have a .10 reading on a Breathalyzer calibrated for the average 2100:1 ratio.\n\n==Metabolism and excretion==\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2007}}\nAlcohol is absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, but more slowly in the stomach than in the small or large intestine.  For this reason, alcohol consumed with food is absorbed more slowly, because it spends a longer time in the stomach.  Furthermore, [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] is present in the stomach lining.  After absorption, the alcohol passes to the liver through the [[hepatic portal vein]], where it undergoes a first pass of metabolism before entering the general bloodstream.<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of alcoholic beverages : technical, analytical and nutritional aspects|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-97665-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNc34oNpg0AC&pg=PT219|editor=Alan J.Buglass|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlcohol is removed from the bloodstream by a combination of [[metabolism]], excretion, and evaporation.\n\nAlcohol is metabolized mainly by the group of six [[enzyme]]s collectively called [[alcohol dehydrogenase]].  These convert the ethanol into [[acetaldehyde]] (an intermediate more toxic than ethanol).  The enzyme [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] then converts the acetaldehyde into non-toxic acetic acid.\n\nMany physiologically active materials are removed from the bloodstream (whether by [[metabolism]] or excretion) at a rate proportional to the current concentration, so that they exhibit [[exponential decay]] with a characteristic [[half-life#Half-life in biology and pharmacology|halflife]] (see [[pharmacokinetics]]). This is not true for alcohol, however. Typical doses of alcohol actually saturate the enzymes' capacity, so that alcohol is removed from the bloodstream at an approximately constant rate. This rate varies considerably between individuals. Another sex based difference is in the elimination of alcohol. People under 25{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, women<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/0-306-47138-8_9 |chapter=Gender Differences in Alcohol Metabolism |title=Recent Developments in Alcoholism |year=2002 |last1=Thomasson |first1=Holly R. |isbn=0-306-44921-8 |volume=12 |pages=163\u201372}}</ref> or with liver disease may process alcohol more slowly.  False High (BAC) readings are related to patients with proteinuria and hematuria, due to kidney-liver metabolism and failure (for example, Hematuria 1+ protenuria 1+ )\n\nSuch persons have impaired [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]], which causes acetaldehyde levels to peak higher, producing more severe [[hangover]]s and other effects such as flushing and tachycardia.  Conversely, members of certain ethnicities that traditionally did not use alcoholic beverages have lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenases and thus \"sober up\" very slowly, but reach lower aldehyde concentrations and have milder hangovers.  Rate of detoxification of alcohol can also be slowed by certain drugs which interfere with the action of alcohol dehydrogenases, notably [[aspirin]], [[furfural]] (which may be found in [[fusel alcohol]]), fumes of [[trichloroethylene|certain solvents]], many [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], and some [[pyrazole]] compounds. Also suspected of having this effect are [[cimetidine]] (Tagamet), [[ranitidine]] (Zantac), and [[paracetamol|acetaminophen]] ([[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]]) (paracetamol).\n\nCurrently, the only known substance that can increase the rate of metabolism of alcohol is [[fructose]]. The effect can vary significantly from person to person, but a 100&nbsp;g dose of fructose has been shown to increase alcohol metabolism by an average of 80%. Fructose also increases false positives of high BAC ratio readings in anyone with proteinuria and hematuria, due to kidney-liver metabolism.<ref name=\"#\">Fructose & ethanol\n* {{cite

Metabolism can be affected by numerous factors, including such things as body temperature, the type of alcoholic beverage consumed, and the amount and type of food consumed.\n\nIn an increasing number of states, laws have been enacted to facilitate this speculative task: the blood alcohol content at the time of driving is legally presumed to be the same as when later tested.  There are usually time limits put on this presumption, commonly two or three hours, and the defendant is permitted to offer evidence to rebut this presumption.\n\nForward extrapolation can also be attempted. If the amount of alcohol consumed is known, along with such variables as the weight and sex of the subject and period and rate of consumption, the blood alcohol level can be estimated by extrapolating forward. Although subject to the same infirmities as retrograde extrapolation\u2014guessing based upon averages and unknown variables\u2014this can be relevant in estimating BAC when driving and/or corroborating or contradicting the results of a later chemical test.\n\n== Highest recorded blood alcohol level/content ==\nThere have been reported cases of blood alcohol content higher than 1%:\n* In 1982, a 24-year-old woman was admitted to the UCLA emergency room with a serum alcohol content of 1.51%, corresponding to a BAC of 1.33%.

Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom [[advocacy]] and [[litigation]]. Their tasks include taking cases in superior [[court]]s and [[tribunal]]s, drafting legal [[pleading]]s, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions. Often, barristers are also recognised as ''[[jurist|legal scholars]]''.\n\nBarristers are distinguished from [[solicitor]]s, who have more direct access to clients, and may do transactional-type legal work. It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges, and they are rarely hired by clients directly. In some legal systems, including those of [[Scots law|Scotland]], [[Anglo-Dutch law|South Africa]], [[Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law#Scandinavian Law|Scandinavia]], [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Law of India|India]], [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], and the British Crown dependencies of [[Law of Jersey|Jersey]], [[Guernsey#Politics|Guernsey]] and the [[Manx Law|Isle of Man]], the word barrister is also regarded as an [[honorific]] title.\n\nIn a few jurisdictions, barristers are usually forbidden from \"conducting\" litigation, and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor, who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court, and [[legal writing|drafting]] court documents. In England and Wales, barristers may seek authorisation from the [[Bar Standards Board]] to conduct litigation. This allows a barrister to practise in a 'dual capacity', fulfilling the role of both barrister and solicitor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shensmithbarristers.co.uk/|title=Video: Introduction to ShenSmith Barristers by barristers, Sunil Rupasinha, and Dirk van Heck|publisher=ShenSmith barristers}}</ref>\n\nIn some countries with common law legal systems, such as [[New Zealand]] and some regions of [[Australia]], [[lawyer]]s are entitled to practise both as barristers and solicitors, but it remains a separate system of qualification to practise exclusively as a barrister.\n\n==Differences between barristers and other lawyers==\n\n===Differences===\n[[File:Scottish Court wigs (2013).JPG|thumb|left|190px|A barrister's wigs, Parliament Hall, Edinburgh]]\nA barrister, who can be considered as a jurist, is a lawyer who represents a litigant as advocate before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. A barrister speaks in court and presents the case before a judge or jury. In some jurisdictions, a barrister receives additional training in evidence law, ethics, and court practice and procedure. In contrast, a solicitor generally meets with clients, does preparatory and administrative work and provides legal advice. In this role, he or she may draft and review legal documents, interact with the client as necessary, prepare evidence, and generally manage the day-to-day administration of a lawsuit. A solicitor can provide a crucial support role to a barrister when in court, such as managing large volumes of documents in the case or even negotiating a settlement outside the courtroom while the trial continues inside.\n\nThere are other essential differences. A barrister will usually have [[rights of audience]] in the higher courts, whereas other legal professionals will often have more limited access, or will need to acquire additional qualifications to have such access. As in common law countries in which there is a split between the roles of barrister and solicitor, the barrister in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions is responsible for appearing in trials or pleading cases before the courts.\n\nBarristers usually have particular knowledge of case law, precedent, and the skills to \"build\" a case. When a solicitor in general practice is confronted with an unusual point of law, they may seek the \"opinion of counsel\" on the issue.<ref>In [[insurance]] contracts there is often the requirement to seek the expert opinion of counsel where the policy contains what is known as \"a [[QC clause]]\".</ref>\n\nIn most countries, barristers operate as sole practitioners, and are prohibited from forming partnerships or from working as a barrister as part of a corporation. (In 2009, the Clementi Report recommended the abolition of this restriction in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-services-review.org.uk/content/report/index.htm |title=Clementi report |publisher=Legal-services-review.org.uk |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2012-03-12}}</ref>) However, barristers normally band together into \"[[Chambers (law)|chambers]]\" to share clerks (administrators) and operating expenses. Some chambers grow to be large and sophisticated, and have a distinctly corporate feel. In some jurisdictions, they may be employed by firms of solicitors, banks, or corporations as in-house legal advisers.\n\nIn contrast, solicitors and attorneys work directly with the clients and are responsible for engaging a barrister with the appropriate expertise for the case. Barristers generally have little or no direct contact with their 'lay clients', particularly without the presence or involvement of the solicitor. All correspondence, inquiries, invoices, and so on, will be addressed to the solicitor, who is primarily responsible for the barrister's fees.\n\nIn court, barristers are often visibly distinguished from solicitors by their apparel. For example, in Ireland, England, and Wales, a barrister usually wears a horsehair wig, stiff collar, [[Bands (neckwear)|bands]], and a gown. Since January 2008, [[solicitor advocate]]s have also been entitled to wear wigs, but wear different gowns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Practice%20Directions/prac_dir_court_dress.pdf |title=Practice Direction |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328124913/http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Practice%20Directions/prac_dir_court_dress.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn many countries the traditional divisions between barristers and solicitors are breaking down. Barristers once enjoyed a monopoly on appearances before the higher courts, but in [[Great Britain]] this has now been abolished, and solicitor advocates can generally appear for clients at trial. Increasingly, firms of solicitors are keeping even the most advanced advisory and litigation work in-house for economic and client relationship reasons. Similarly, the prohibition on barristers taking instructions directly from the public has also been widely abolished. But, in practice, direct instruction is still a rarity in most jurisdictions, partly because barristers with narrow specializations, or who are only really trained for advocacy, are not prepared to provide general advice to members of the public.\n\nHistorically, barristers have had a major role in trial preparation, including drafting [[pleading]]s and reviewing evidence. In some areas of law, that is still the case. In other areas, it is relatively common for the barrister to receive the brief from the instructing solicitor to represent a client at trial only a day or two before the proceeding. Part of the reason for this is cost. A barrister is entitled to a 'brief fee' when a brief is delivered, and this represents the bulk of her/his fee in relation to any trial. They are then usually entitled to a 'refresher' for each day of the trial after the first. But if a case is settled before the trial, the barrister is not needed and the brief fee would be wasted. Some solicitors avoid this by delaying delivery of the brief until it is certain the case will go to trial.\n\n===Justification for a split profession===\nSome benefits of maintaining the split include:\n* Having an independent barrister reviewing a course of action gives the client a fresh and independent opinion from an expert in the field distinct from solicitors who may maintain ongoing and long-term relationships with the client.<ref>This view was expressed by Sir Owen Dixon, Chief Justice of Australia, [http://www.nswbar.asn.au/docs/about/what_is/dixon.php on his swearing in as Chief Justice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329141439/http://www.nswbar.asn.au/docs/about/what_is/dixon.php |date=March 29, 2014 }}</ref>\n* In many jurisdictions, judges are appointed from the bar. Since barristers do not have long-term client relationships, and are further removed from clients than solicitors, judicial appointees are more independent. \n* Having recourse to all of the specialist barristers at the bar can enable smaller firms, who could not maintain large specialist departments, to compete with larger firms.\n* A barrister acts as a check on the solicitor conducting the trial; if it becomes apparent that the claim or defence has not been properly conducted by the solicitor prior to trial, the barrister can (and usually has a duty to) advise the client of a separate possible claim against the solicitor.\n* Expertise in conducting trials, owing to the fact that barristers are specialist advocates. \n* In many jurisdictions, barristers must follow the [[cab-rank rule]], which obliges them to accept a brief if it is in their area of expertise and if they are available, facilitating access to justice for the unpopular.\n\nSome disadvantages of the split include:\n* A multiplicity of legal advisers can lead to less efficiency and higher costs, a concern to Sir [[David Clementi]] in his review of the English legal profession.<ref>[http://www.aiga.it/old/pdf/doc-57-871.pdf ''Review of the Regulatory Framework for Legal Services in England and Wales'', Sir Davuid Clementi, December 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140522/http://www.aiga.it/old/pdf/doc-57-871.pdf |date=April 13, 2014 }}</ref>\n* Because they are further removed from the client, barristers can be less familiar with the client's needs.\n\nA detailed examination of the justifications for a split legal profession and of the arguments in favour of a fused profession can be found in English solicitor Peter Reeve\u2019s 1986 book, ''Are Two Legal Professions Necessary?''<ref>London: Waterlow Publishers Limited, 1986 (foreword by Sir David Napley)</ref>\n\n==Regulation==\n[[Image:Gray's inn zzz.JPG|thumb|[[Gray's Inn]], [[London]]]]\nBarristers are regulated by the [[Bar association|Bar]] for the jurisdiction where they practise, and in some countries, by the [[Inns of Court|Inn of Court]] to which they belong. In some countries, there is external regulation.\n\nInns of Court, where they exist, regulate admission to the profession. Inns of Court are independent societies that are titularly responsible for the training, admission (calling), and discipline of barristers. Where they exist, a person may only be called to the Bar by an Inn, of which they must first be a member. In fact, historically, call to and success at the Bar, to a large degree, depended upon social connections made early in life.<ref>Daniel Duman, ''The English and Colonial Bars in the 19th Century'' (Routledge: London, 1983) {{ISBN|0-85664-468-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-85664-468-9}}</ref>\n\nA Bar collectively describes all members of the profession of barrister within a given jurisdiction. While as a minimum the Bar is an association embracing all its members, it is usually the case, either ''de facto'' or ''de jure'', that the Bar is invested with regulatory powers over the manner in which barristers practise.\n\n==Barristers around the world==\nIn the common law tradition, the respective roles of a lawyer \u2013 that is as legal adviser and advocate \u2013 were formally split into two separate, regulated sub-professions, the other being the office of solicitor. Historically, the distinction was absolute, but in the modern legal age, some countries that had a split legal profession now have a [[fused profession]] \u2013 anyone entitled to practise as a barrister may also practise as a solicitor, and vice versa. In practice, the distinction may be non-existent, minor, or marked, depending on the jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, such Australia, Scotland and Ireland, there is little overlap.\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:M Battye.jpg|[[Margaret Battye]], 1930s Australian court dress|thumb]]\nIn the Australian states of [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]], there is a split profession. Nevertheless, subject to conditions, barristers can accept direct access work from clients. Each state Bar Association regulates the profession and essentially has the functions of the English Inns of Court. In the states of [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]], as well as the [[Australian Capital Territory]], the professions of barrister and solicitor are fused, but an independent bar nonetheless exists, regulated by the Legal Practice Board of the state or territory. In [[Tasmania]] and the [[Northern Territory]], the profession is fused, although a very small number of practitioners operate as an independent bar.\n\nGenerally counsel dress in the traditional English manner (wig, gown, and [[jabot (neckwear)|jabot]]) before superior courts, although this is not usually done for interlocutory applications. Wigs and robes are still worn in the Supreme Court and the District Court in civil matters and is dependent on the judicial officer's attire. Robes and wigs are worn in all criminal cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswbar.asn.au/docs/professional/attire_state.php |title=NSWbar.asn.au |publisher=NSWbar.asn.au |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316140122/http://www.nswbar.asn.au/docs/professional/attire_state.php |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}</ref> In Western Australia, wigs are no longer worn in any court.\n\nEach year, the Bar Association appoints certain barristers of seniority and eminence to the rank of \"Senior Counsel\" (in most States and Territories) or \"Queen's Counsel\" (in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Victoria). Such barristers carry the title \"SC\" or \"QC\" after their name. The appointments are made after a process of consultation with members of the profession and the judiciary. Senior Counsel appear in particularly complex or difficult cases. They make up about 14 per cent of the bar in New South Wales.\n\n===Bangladesh===\nIn Bangladesh, the law relating to the Barristers is the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order,1972 (President Order No.46) as amended which is administered and enforced by the Bangladesh Bar Council. Bangladesh Bar Council is the supreme statutory body to regulate the legal professions in Bangladesh and ensure educational standard and regulatory compliance by the Advocates on roll of the Bar Council. The Bar Council, with the help of government, prescribes rules to regulate the profession. All law graduates educating from home or abroad have to write and pass the Bar Council Examination to be enrolled and admitted as professional Advocates to practice law both as Barristers & Solicitors. The newly enrolled advocates are permitted to start practice in the lower (District) courts after admitting as members of the local (District) Bar Associations. After two years of Practice in lower court the Advocates are eligible to be enrolled in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. By passing the Bar Council Examination, the advocates are issued with certificates of enrollment and permission in prescribed form to practise in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court also. Only those advocates who became Barristers in U.K. maintain their honorific title of barristers. In Bangladesh there is an association called Barristers' Association of Bangladesh that represents the such U.K. bases barristers.[10]\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada (except [[Quebec]]), the professions of barrister and solicitor are fused, and many lawyers refer to themselves with both names, even if they do not practise in both areas.<ref>Stephen Waddams, ''Introduction to the Study of Law'', 7th ed (Toronto: Carswell, 2010) at 128.</ref> In colloquial parlance within the Canadian legal profession, lawyers often term themselves as \"litigators\" (or \"barristers\"), or as \"solicitors\", depending on the nature of their law practice though some may in effect practise as both litigators and solicitors. However, \"litigators\" would generally perform all litigation functions traditionally performed by barristers and solicitors; in contrast, those terming themselves \"solicitors\" would generally limit themselves to legal work not involving practice before the courts (not even in a preparatory manner as performed by solicitors in England), though some might practise before chambers judges. As is the practice in many other Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia, Canadian litigators are \"gowned\", but without a wig, when appearing before courts of \"superior jurisdiction\". All law graduates from Canadian Law schools, and NCA certificates of Qualification (Internationally trained lawyers) from the Federation of Law Society of Canada after having completed more than a year article-ship in law firms write the Bar and Solicitor examinations as prescribed by their professional regulating body, the Law Societies (e.g. Law Society of Upper Canada). The passed candidates are called to the degree of Barrister-at-law and issued with Certificate of Barristers and Solicitors and admit to practice in Her Majesty's Bar within the control of the Society.  \n\nThe situation is somewhat different in Quebec as a result of its [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition. The profession of solicitor, or ''avou\u00e9'', never took hold in colonial Quebec, so attorneys<ref>Here the term ''attorney'' may be preferable as an ''avocat'' is very much like an American attorney in that he/she may be both a trial and case lawyer.</ref> (''avocats'') have traditionally been a fused profession, arguing and preparing cases in contentious matters, whereas Quebec's other type of lawyer, [[civil law notary|civil-law notaries]] (''notaires''), handle out-of-court non-contentious matters. However, a number of areas of non-contentious [[private law]] are not monopolized by notaries so that attorneys often specialise in handling either trials, cases, advising, or non-trial matters. The only disadvantage is that attorneys cannot draw up [[public instrument]]s that have the same force of law as [[act (document)|notarial acts]]. Most large law firms in Quebec offer the full range of legal services of law firms in common-law provinces. Intending Quebec attorneys must earn a bachelor's degree in civil law, pass the provincial bar examination, and successfully complete a legal internship to be admitted to practice. Attorneys are regulated by the Quebec Law Society (''Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec'').\n\n===France===\nIn France, ''avocats'', or attorneys, were, until the 20th century, the equivalent of barristers. The profession included several grades ranked by seniority: ''avocat-stagiaire'' (trainee, who was already qualified but needed to complete two years (or more, depending on the period) of training alongside seasoned lawyers), ''avocat'', and ''avocat honoraire'' (senior barrister). Since the 14th century and during the course of the 19th and 20th in particular, French barristers competed in territorial battles over respective areas of legal practice against the ''conseil juridique'' (legal advisor, transactional solicitor) and ''avou\u00e9'' (procedural solicitor), and expanded to become the generalist legal practitioner, with the notable exception of ''notaires'' (notaries), who are ministry appointed lawyers (with a separate qualification) and who retain exclusivity over conveyancing and probate. After the 1971 and 1990 legal reforms, the ''avocat'' was fused with the ''avou\u00e9'' and the ''conseil juridique'', making the ''avocat'' (or, if female, ''avocate'') an all-purpose lawyer for matters of contentious jurisdiction, analogous to an American attorney. French attorneys usually do not (although it they are entitled to) act both as litigators (trial lawyers) and legal consultants (advising lawyers), known respectively as ''avocat plaidant'' and ''avocat-conseil''. This distinction is however purely informal and does not correspond to any difference in qualification or admission to the roll. All intending attorneys must pass an examination to be able to enrol in one of the ''Centre r\u00e9gional de formation \u00e0 la profession d'avocat (CRFPA)'' (Regional centre for the training of lawyers). The ''CRFPA'' course has a duration of two years and is a mix between classroom teachings and internships. Its culmination is the ''stage final'' (final training), where the intending attorney spends 6 months in a law firm (generally in his/her favoured field of practice and in a firm in which he/she hopes to be recruited afterwards). The intending attorney then needs to pass the ''Certificat d'Aptitude \u00e0 la Profession d'Avocat (CAPA)'', which is the last professional examination allowing him/her to join a court's bar (''barreau''). It is generally recognised that the first examination is much more difficult than the CAPA and is dreaded by most law students. Each bar is regulated by a Bar Council (''Ordre du barreau'').\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany, no distinction is made and lawyers may plead at all courts with the exception of the civil branch of the Federal Court of Justice (''Bundesgerichtshof'') to which fewer than fifty lawyers are admitted <ref>\u00a7 78 of the ''Zivilprozessordnung''.</ref> as of 10 August 2018. See the  [http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/DE/DasGericht/ExterneVerfahrensbeteiligte/ZugelasseneRechtsanwaelte/zugelasseneRechtsanwaelte_node.html ''list of lawyers admitted to the Bundesgerichtshof'']. Those lawyers may not plead at other courts, almost only deal with litigation, and are usually instructed by a lawyer who represented the client in the lower courts. However, these restrictions do not apply to criminal cases, nor to pleadings at courts of the other court systems (labour, administrative, taxation, and social courts, as well as the EU court system).\n\n===Hong Kong===\n{{main article|Hong Kong Bar Association}}\nThe legal profession in Hong Kong is also divided into two branches: barristers and solicitors.\n\nIn the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] and the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]], as a general rule, only barristers and [[solicitor-advocate]]s are allowed to speak on behalf of any party in open court. This means that solicitors are restricted from doing so. In these two courts, barristers dress in the traditional English manner, as do the judges and other lawyers.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the rank of Queen's Counsel was granted prior to the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong]] from the [[United Kingdom]] to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1997. After the handover, the rank has been replaced by [[Senior Counsel]] [[post-nominal letters]]: SC. Senior Counsel may still, however, style themselves as silks, like their British counterparts.\n\n===India===\nIn [[Law of India|India]], the law relating to the Barrister is the Advocates Act, 1961 introduced and thought up by [[Ashoke Kumar Sen]], the then law minister of India, which is a law passed by the Parliament and is administered and enforced by the [[Bar Council of India]]. Under the act, the Bar Council of India is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country. For this purpose, the Bar Council of India is authorized to pass regulations and make orders in individual cases and also generally.\n\nEach State has a Bar Council of its own whose function is to enroll the Barristers willing to practise predominately within the territorial confines of that State and to perform the functions of the Bar Council of India within the territory assigned to them. Therefore, each law degree holder must be enrolled with a (single) State Bar Council to practise in India. However, enrollment with any State Bar Council does not restrict the Barrister from appearing before any court in India, even though it is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the State Bar Council which he is enrolled in.\nThe advantage with having the State Bar Councils is that the work load of the Bar Council of India can be divided into these various State Bar Councils and also that matters can be dealt with locally and in an expedited manner. However, for all practical and legal purposes, the Bar Council of India retains with it, the final power to take decisions in any and all matters related to the legal profession on the whole or with respect to any \nThe process for being entitled to practise in India is twofold. First, the applicant must be a holder of a law degree from a recognized institution in India (or from one of the four recognised Universities in the United Kingdom) and second, must pass the enrollment qualifications of the Bar Council of the state where he/she seeks to be enrolled. For this purpose, the Bar Council of India has an internal Committee whose function is to supervise and examine the various institutions conferring law degrees and to grant recognition to these institutions once they meet the required standards. In this manner the Bar Council of India also ensures the standard of education required for practising in India are met with. As regards the qualification for enrollment with the State Bar Council, while the actual formalities may vary from one State to another, yet predominately they ensure that the application has not been a bankrupt /criminal and is generally fit to practise before courts of India.\nEnrollment with a Bar Council also means that the law degree holder is recognized as a Barrister and is required to maintain a standards of conduct and professional demeanor at all times, both on and off the profession. The Bar Council of India also prescribes \"Rules of Conduct\" to be observed by the Barristers in the courts, while interacting with clients and even otherwise.\n\n===Ireland===\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], admission to the Bar by the Chief Justice of Ireland is restricted to those on whom a Barrister-at-Law degree (B.L.) has first been conferred. [[King's Inns|The Honorable Society of King's Inns]]<!-- without a \"u\" --><ref>Note: the historical spelling variant ''Honorable'', not the contemporary Honourable</ref> is the only educational establishment which runs vocational courses for barristers in the Republic and degrees of Barrister-at-Law can only be conferred by King's Inns. King's Inns are also the only body with the capacity to call individuals to the bar and to disbar them.\n\nMost Irish barristers choose to be governed thereafter by the [[Bar Council of Ireland]], a quasi-private entity. Senior members of the profession may be selected for elevation to the Inner Bar, when they may describe themselves as Senior Counsel (\"S.C.\"). Admission to the Inner Bar is made by declaration before the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]], [[patent of precedence|patents of precedence]] having been granted by the [[Government of Ireland|Government]]. Irish barristers are sole practitioners and may not form chambers or partnerships if they wish to remain members of the Bar Council's Law Library.\n\nTo practise under the Bar Council of Ireland's rules, a newly qualified barrister is apprenticed to an experienced barrister of at least seven years' experience. This apprenticeship is known as [[pupillage]] or [[devilling]]. Devilling is compulsory for those barristers who wish to be members of the Law Library and lasts for one legal year. It is common to devil for a second year in a less formal arrangement but this is not compulsory.\n\n===Israel===\nIn Israel there is no distinction between barristers and solicitors, even though the judicial system is based mostly on English common law, as a continuation of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate in Palestine]].\n\n===Japan===\nJapan adopts a unified system. However, there are certain classes of qualified professionals who are allowed to practise in certain limited areas of law, such as scriveners (''\"shiho shoshi\"'', qualified to handle title registration, deposit, and certain petite court proceedings with additional certification), tax accountants (''\"zeirishi\"'', qualified to prepare tax returns, provide advice on tax computation and represent a client in administrative tax appeals) and patent agents (''\"benrishi\"'', qualified to practise patent registration and represent a client in administrative patent appeals). Only the lawyers (''\"bengoshi\"'') can appear before court and are qualified to practise in any areas of law, including, but not limited to, areas that those qualified law-related professionals above are allowed to practise. Most attorneys still focus primarily on court practice and still a very small number of attorneys give sophisticated and expertised legal advice on a day-to-day basis to large corporations.\n\n===Netherlands===\nThe [[Netherlands]] used to have a semi-separated legal profession comprising the lawyer and the ''procureur'', the latter resembling, to some extent, the profession of barrister. Under that system, lawyers were entitled to represent their clients in law, but were only able to file cases before the court at which they were registered. Cases falling under the jurisdiction of another court had to be filed by a ''procureur'' registered at that court, in practice often another lawyer exercising both functions. Questions were raised on the necessity of the separation, given the fact that its main purpose \u2013 the preservation of the quality of the legal profession and observance of local court rules and customs \u2013 had become obsolete. For that reason, the ''procureur'' as a separate profession was abolished and its functions merged with the legal profession in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocatenorde.nl/2118/consumenten/Nieuws/afschaffing-procuraat-per-1-september-2008-definitief.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426091455/http://www.advocatenorde.nl/2118/consumenten/Nieuws/afschaffing-procuraat-per-1-september-2008-definitief.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 April 2012 |title=Afschaffing procuraat per 1 September 2008 definitief |publisher=Nederlandse Orde van Advocaten |date=22 August 2008 |accessdate=2012-01-04 }}</ref> Currently, lawyers can file cases before any court, regardless of where they are registered. The only notable exception concerns cases brought before the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Supreme Court]], which have to be handled by lawyers registered in the district of [[South Holland]], mainly for qualitative reasons.\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn New Zealand, the professions are not formally fused but practitioners are enrolled in the High Court as \"Barristers and Solicitors\". They may choose, however, to practise as barristers sole. About 15% practise solely as barristers, mainly in the larger cities and usually in \"chambers\" (following the British terminology). They receive \"instructions\" from other practitioners, at least nominally. They usually conduct the proceedings in their entirety.\n\nAny lawyer may apply to become a [[Queen's Counsel]] (QC) to recognize long standing contribution to the legal profession but this status is only conferred on those practising as solicitors in exceptional circumstances. This step, referred to as \"being called to the inner bar\" or \"taking silk\", is considered highly prestigious and has been a step in the career of many New Zealand judges.\n\nUnlike other jurisdictions, the term \"junior barrister\" is popularly used to refer to a lawyer who holds a practising certificate as a barrister, but is employed by another, more senior barrister. Generally, junior barristers are within their first five years of practise and are not yet qualified to practise as barristers sole. Barristers sole (i.e. barristers who are not employed by another barrister) who are not Queen's Counsel are never referred to as junior barristers.\n\n===Nigeria===\nIn [[Nigeria]], there is no formal distinction between barristers and solicitors. All students who pass the bar examinations \u2013 offered exclusively by the [[Nigerian Law School]] \u2013 are called to the Nigerian bar, by the Body of Benchers. Lawyers may argue in any Federal trial or appellate court as well as any of the courts in Nigeria's 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The Legal Practitioner's Act, refers to Nigerian lawyers as Legal Practitioners, and following their [[call to the Bar]], Nigerian lawyers enter their names in the register or Roll of Legal Practitioners kept at the Supreme Court. Perhaps for this reason, a Nigerian lawyer is also often referred to as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, and many Nigerian lawyers term themselves Barrister-at-Law complete with the postnominal initials \"B.L.\".\n\nThe vast majority of Nigerian lawyers combine contentious and non-contentious work, although there is a growing tendency for practitioners in the bigger practices to specialise in one or the other. In colloquial parlance within the Nigerian legal profession, lawyers may for this reason be referred to as \"litigators\" or as \"solicitors\".\n\nConsistent with the practice in England and elsewhere in the Commonwealth, senior members of the profession may be selected for elevation to the Inner Bar by conferment of the rank of [[Senior Advocate of Nigeria]] (SAN).\n\n===Pakistan===\nIn [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]] to practice as a Barrister, law graduates have to complete three steps. They have to pass the Bar Practice and Training Course (BPTC), be Called to the Bar by an Inn of Court from England and Wales and attain a licence to practice as an advocate in the Courts of Pakistan from the relevant Bar Council, provincial or federal.\n\n===Poland===\nIn [[Poland]], there are two main types of legal professions: [[advocate]] and legal counsel. Both are regulated and these professions are restricted only for people who graduated five-year law studies, have at least three years of experience and passed five difficult national exams (civil law, criminal law, company law, administrative law and ethic) or have a doctor of law degree. Before 2015, the only difference was that advocates have a right to represent clients before the court in all cases and the legal advisors could not represent clients before the court in criminal cases. Presently, the legal advisors can also represent clients in criminal cases so currently, the differences between this professions are only historical significance.\n\n===South Africa===\n{{main article|Advocate#Advocates in South Africa}}\nIn [[South Africa]] the employment and practise of advocates (as barristers are known in South Africa) is consistent with the rest of the Commonwealth. Advocates carry the rank of Junior or Senior Counsel (SC), and are mostly briefed and paid by solicitors (known as [[Attorneys in South Africa|attorneys]]). They are usually employed in the higher courts, particularly in the Appeal Courts where they often appear as specialist counsel. South African solicitors (attorneys) follow a practice of referring cases to Counsel for an opinion before proceeding with a case, when Counsel in question practises as a specialist in the case law at stake. Aspiring advocates currently spend one year in pupillage (formerly only six months) before being admitted to the bar in their respective provincial or judicial jurisdictions. The term 'Advocate' is sometimes used in South Africa as a title, e. g. 'Advocate John Doe, SC' ('Advokaat' in Afrikaans) in the same fashion as 'Dr. John Doe' for a medical doctor.\n\n===South Korea===\nIn South Korea, there is no distinction between the judiciary and lawyers. Previously, a person who has passed the national bar exam after two years of national education is able to become a judge, prosecutor, or \"lawyer\" in accordance to their grades upon graduation. As a result of changes from implementing an accommodated law school system, there are two standard means of becoming a lawyer. Under the current legal system, to be a judge or a prosecutor, lawyers need to practise their legal knowledge. A \"lawyer\" does not have any limitation of practice.\n\n===Spain===\nSpain has a division but it does not correspond to the division in Britain between barristers/advocates and solicitors. ''Procuradores'' represent the litigant procedurally in court, generally under the authority of a power of attorney executed by a civil law notary, while ''abogados'' represent the substantive claims of the litigant through trial advocacy. ''Abogados'' perform both transactional work and advise in connection with court proceedings, and they have full right of audience in front of the court. The court proceeding is carried out with ''abogados'', not with procuradores. In a nutshell, procuradores are court agents that operate under the instructions of an ''abogado''. Their practice is confined to the locality of the court to which they are admitted.\n\n===United States===\nThe United States does not draw a distinction between lawyers as pleaders (barristers) and lawyers as agents (or solicitors). All lawyers who have passed a [[bar examination]] and have been admitted to practice may prosecute or defend in the courts of the state where they are admitted. Historically, a distinction was made, and a separate label for barristers (called \"counselors\", hence the expression \"attorney ''and'' counselor at law\") existed in certain states, though both professions have long since been fused into the all-purpose attorney.<ref>Berger, Marylin J. \"A Comparative Study of British Barristers and American Legal Practice and Education\". (Northwestern Journal of International Business and Law: 1983). Retrieved 04-07-2018. https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1152&context=njilb</ref> Attorneys specializing in court procedure, combining advocacy and case preparation, are called ''trial attorneys'' or ''litigators''.\n\n[[South Carolina]] no longer requires attorneys to be licensed separately to plead in a courtroom. Additionally, some state appellate courts require attorneys to obtain a separate certificate of admission to plead and practise in the appellate court. Federal courts require specific admission to that court's bar to practise before it. At the state appellate level and in Federal courts, there is generally no separate examination process, although some U.S. district courts require an examination on practices and procedures in their specific courts. Unless an examination is required, admission is usually granted as a matter of course to any licensed attorney in the state where the court is located. Some federal courts will grant admission to any attorney licensed in any U.S. jurisdiction.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====England and Wales====\n{{main article|Barristers in England and Wales}}\n[[File:Photograph of Helena Normanton c. 1930 (22770439042).jpg|thumb|[[Helena Normanton]], first female British barrister.]]\nAlthough with somewhat different laws, [[England]] and [[Wales]] are considered within the United Kingdom [[England and Wales|a single united and unified legal jurisdiction]] for the purposes of both civil and criminal law, alongside Scotland and Northern Ireland, the other two legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom. England and Wales are covered by a common bar (an organisation of barristers) and a single law society (an organisation of solicitors).\n\nThe profession of barrister in England and Wales is a separate profession from that of solicitor. It is, however, possible to hold the qualification of both barrister and solicitor at the same time. It is not necessary to leave the bar to qualify as a solicitor.\n\nBarristers are regulated by the [[Bar Standards Board]], a division of the [[General Council of the Bar]]. A barrister must be a member of one of the [[Inns of Court]], which traditionally educated and regulated barristers. There are four Inns of Court: [[Lincoln's Inn|The Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn]], [[Gray's Inn|The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn]], [[Middle Temple|The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple]], and [[Inner Temple|The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple]]. All are situated in central London, near the [[Royal Courts of Justice]]. They perform scholastic and social roles, and in all cases, provide financial aid to student barristers (subject to merit) through scholarships. It is the Inns that actually \"call\" the student to the Bar at a ceremony similar to a graduation. Social functions include dining with other members and guests and hosting other events.\n\nLaw graduates wishing to work and be known as barristers must take the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC \u2013 previously Bar Vocational Course or BVC) at one of the institutions authorised by the Bar Council to offer the BPTC.<ref>Qualification details of English Bar, [http://thepupillagepages.com/ thepupillagepages.com]</ref> On successful completion of the BPTC student barristers are \"called\" to the bar by their respective inns and are elevated to the degree of \"Barrister\". However, before they can practise independently they must first undertake 12 months of [[pupillage]]. The first six months of this period is spent shadowing more senior practitioners, after which pupil barristers may begin to undertake some court work of their own. Following successful completion of this stage, most barristers then join a set of Chambers, a group of counsel who share the costs of premises and support staff whilst remaining individually self-employed.\n\nIn December 2014 there were just over 15,500 barristers in independent practice, of whom about ten percent are [[Queen's Counsel]] and the remainder are [[junior barrister]]s. Many barristers (about 2,800) are employed in companies as 'in-house' counsel, or by local or national government or in academic institutions.\n\nCertain barristers in England and Wales are now instructed directly by members of the public.<ref>[http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/about/find-a-barrister/public-access-directory/ Public Access Directory of The Bar Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229171106/http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/about/find-a-barrister/public-access-directory/ |date=December 29, 2011 }}</ref> Members of the public may engage the services of the barrister directly within the framework of the [[Public Access Scheme]]; a solicitor is not involved at any stage. Barristers undertaking public access work can provide legal advice and representation in court in almost all areas of law (see the Public Access Information on the Bar Council website)<ref>[http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/guidance/publicaccessinformationforlayclients/ Barcouncil.org.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322204941/http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/guidance/publicaccessinformationforlayclients/ |date=March 22, 2010 }}</ref> and are entitled to represent clients in any court or tribunal in England and Wales. Once instructions from a client are accepted, it is the barrister (rather than the solicitor) who advises and guides the client through the relevant legal procedure or litigation.\n\nBefore a barrister can undertake Public Access work, they must have completed a special course. At present, about one in 20 barristers has so qualified. There is also a separate scheme called 'Licensed Access', available to certain nominated classes of professional client; it is not open to the general public. Public access work is experiencing a huge surge at the bar, with barristers taking advantage of the new opportunity for the bar to make profit in the face of legal aid cuts elsewhere in the profession.\n\nThe ability of barristers to accept such instructions is a recent development; it results from a change in the rules set down by the General Council of the Bar in July 2004. The Public Access Scheme has been introduced as part of the drive to open up the legal system to the public and to make it easier and cheaper to obtain access to legal advice. It further reduces the distinction between solicitors and barristers. The distinction remains however because there are certain aspects of a solicitor's role that a barrister is not able to undertake.\n\nSome honorific suffixes to signify notable barristers may be ''[[Esquire]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Esquire (definition)|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/esquire|website=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref> Even though the term ''barrister-at-law'' is sometimes seen, and was once very common, it has never been formally correct in England and Wales. Barrister is the only correct nomenclature.<ref>This was confirmed by the Professional Conduct Committee of the Bar Council when it changed its rules on the usage of the description by individuals in 1970, Annual Statement of the Bar Council, 1969/70.</ref>\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nIn April 2003 there were 554 barristers in independent practice in [[Northern Ireland]]. 66 were [[Queen's Counsel]] (QCs), barristers who have earned a high reputation and are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor as senior advocates and advisers.\n\nThose barristers who are not QCs are called Junior Counsel and are styled \"BL\" or \"Barrister-at-Law\". The term ''junior'' is often misleading since many members of the Junior Bar are experienced barristers with considerable expertise.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[Bencher]]s are, and have been for centuries, the governing bodies of the four [[Inns of Court]] in London and [[King's Inns]], Dublin. The Benchers of the [[Inn of Court of Northern Ireland]] governed the Inn until the enactment of the Constitution of the Inn in 1983, which provides that the government of the Inn is shared between the Benchers, the Executive Council of the Inn and members of the Inn assembled in General Meeting.\n\nThe Executive Council (through its Education Committee) is responsible for considering Memorials submitted by applicants for admission as students of the Inn and by Bar students of the Inn for admission to the degree of Barrister-at-Law and making recommendations to the Benchers. The final decisions on these Memorials are taken by the Benchers. The Benchers also have the exclusive power of expelling or suspending a Bar student and of disbarring a barrister or suspending a barrister from practice.\n\nThe Executive Council is also involved with: education; fees of students; calling counsel to the Bar, although call to the Bar is performed by the [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]] on the invitation of the Benchers; administration of the Bar Library (to which all practising members of the Bar belong); and liaising with corresponding bodies in other countries.\n\nThe Bar Council is responsible for the maintenance of the standards, honour and independence of the Bar and, through its Professional Conduct Committee, receives and investigates complaints against members of the Bar in their professional capacity.\n\n====Scotland====\n{{main article|Advocate}}\n\nIn Scotland, an [[advocate]] is, in all respects except name, a barrister, but there are significant differences in professional practice.\n\nIn Scotland, admission to and the conduct of the profession is regulated by the [[Faculty of Advocates]] (as opposed to an Inn).\n\n=== Crown dependencies and UK Overseas Territories===\n\n====Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey====\nIn the [[Bailiwick of Jersey]], there are solicitors (called ''ecrivains'') and advocates (French ''avocat''). In the Bailiwicks of Jersey and [[Guernsey]] and on the [[Isle of Man]], Advocates perform the combined functions of both solicitors and barristers.\n\n====Gibraltar====\n[[Gibraltar]] is a British Overseas Territory boasting a legal profession based on the common law. The legal profession includes both barristers and solicitors with most barristers also acting as solicitors. Admission and Disciplinary matters in Gibraltar are dealt with by the Bar Council of Gibraltar and the Supreme Court of Gibraltar. In order for barristers or solicitors to be admitted as practising lawyers in Gibraltar they must comply with the Supreme Court Act 1930 as amended by the Supreme Court Amendment Act 2015 which requires, amongst other things, for all newly admitted lawyers as of the 1 July 2015 to undertake a year's course in Gibraltar law at the University of Gibraltar. Solicitors also have right of audience in Gibraltar's courts.\n\n==Popular culture==\n* ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'' (UK) - classic courtroom series\n* ''[[Kavanagh Q.C.]]'' (1995\u20132001) (UK)\n* ''[[North Square]]'' (2000) (UK) - [[Channel 4]] court drama series contains interactions between barristers and solicitors\n* ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' (2001) - Main character Mark Darcy is described as a 'top barrister.'\n* ''[[Silk (TV series)|Silk]]'' (2011\u20132014) (UK) - [[BBC]] court drama series\n* ''[[Rake (Australian TV series)|Rake]]'' (2010-2014) - Australian TV series based on the story of a colourful barrister\n* [[Sydney Carton]] - central character, a barrister, in Charles Dickens's ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''\n* ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', in which the central character is the barrister Sir Wilfred Robards, QC\n* [[Arnold Timsh]] - Target in The Knife of Dunwall, an expansion on the video game Dishonored\n\n==See also==\n* [[Barristers' Ball]]\n* [[Legal professions in England and Wales]]\n* [[Electoral registration in the United Kingdom#Registration process from 1832|Revising Barrister]]\n* [[Special Pleader]]\n* [[Serjeant-at-law]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Abel, Richard L.

Gen.]] [[George Meade]]'s [[Army of the Potomac]] defeated attacks by Confederate [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]], halting Lee's invasion of the North.\n\nAfter his success at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] in [[Virginia]] in May 1863, Lee led his army through the [[Shenandoah Valley]] to begin his second invasion of the North\u2014the [[Gettysburg Campaign]]. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], or even [[Philadelphia]]. Prodded by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] moved his army in pursuit, but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade.\n\nElements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there, his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]], and soon reinforced with two [[corps]] of Union [[infantry]]. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] | title = Battle of Gettysburg | url = https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Gettysburg| access-date =3 July 2012 | date = 15 February 2017 | publisher = [[Britannica.com]]}}</ref>\n\nOn the second day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at [[Little Round Top]], the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Wheatfield|Wheatfield]], [[Devil's Den]], and the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Peach Orchard|Peach Orchard]]. On the Union right, Confederate [[demonstration (military)|demonstrations]] escalated into full-scale assaults on [[Culp's Hill]] and [[Cemetery Hill]]. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.\n\nOn the third day of battle, fighting resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the east and south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on [[Cemetery Ridge]], known as [[Pickett's Charge]]. The charge was repulsed by Union [[Civil War rifles|rifle]] and artillery fire, at great loss to the Confederate army.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Savage War:A Military History of the Civil War|last1=Murray|first1=Williamson|last2=Hsieh|first2=Wayne Wei-siang|chapter=The War in the East, 1863|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|page=278|year=2016|ISBN=978-0-69-116940-8}}</ref>\n\nLee led his army on a torturous [[Retreat from Gettysburg|retreat back to Virginia]].

Lee decided upon a second invasion of the North (the first was the unsuccessful [[Maryland Campaign]] of September 1862, which ended in the bloody [[Battle of Antietam]]). Such a move would upset [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S.]] plans for the summer campaigning season and possibly reduce the pressure on the besieged Confederate garrison at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. The invasion would allow the Confederates to live off the bounty of the rich Northern farms while giving war-ravaged [[Virginia]] a much-needed rest. In addition, Lee's 72,000-man army<ref name=BM260/> could threaten Philadelphia, [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and possibly strengthen the growing peace movement in the North.<ref>Coddington, pp. 8\u20139; Eicher, p. 490.</ref>\n\n===Initial movements to battle===\nThus, on June 3, Lee's army began to shift northward from [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]. Following the death of [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson]], Lee reorganized his two large corps into three new corps, commanded by [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]] (First Corps), Lt. Gen. [[Richard S. Ewell]] (Second), and Lt. Gen. [[A.P. Hill]] (Third); both Ewell and Hill, who had formerly reported to Jackson as division commanders, were new to this level of responsibility. The Cavalry Division remained under the command of Maj. Gen. [[J.E.B. Stuart]].<ref>Eicher, pp. 489\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe Union Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], consisted of seven infantry corps, a cavalry corps, and an Artillery Reserve, for a combined strength of more than 100,000 men.<ref name=BM125/>\n\nThe first major action of the campaign took place on June 9 between cavalry forces at [[Battle of Brandy Station|Brandy Station]], near [[Culpeper, Virginia]]. The 9,500 Confederate cavalrymen under Stuart were surprised by Maj. Gen. [[Alfred Pleasonton]]'s [[combined arms]] force of two cavalry divisions (8,000 troopers) and 3,000 infantry, but Stuart eventually repulsed the Union attack. The inconclusive battle, the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war, proved for the first time that the Union horse soldier was equal to his Southern counterpart.<ref>Symonds, p. 36.</ref>\n\nBy mid-June, the Army of Northern Virginia was poised to cross the Potomac River and enter [[Maryland]]. After defeating the Union garrisons at [[Second Battle of Winchester|Winchester]] and [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]], Ewell's Second Corps began crossing the river on June 15. Hill's and Longstreet's corps followed on June 24 and 25. Hooker's army pursued, keeping between the U.S. capital and Lee's army. The Union army crossed the Potomac from June 25 to 27.<ref>Trudeau, pp. 45, 66.</ref>\n\nLee gave strict orders for his army to minimize any negative impacts on the civilian population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YmsFAAAAQAAJ&printsec=titlepage#PRA1-PA323,M1|title=The Rebellion Record: A Diary of American Events, with Documents, Narratives Illustrative Incidents, Poetry, Etc|first=Frank|last=Moore|date=September 25, 1864|publisher=Putnam|via=Google Books}}</ref> Food, horses, and other supplies were generally not seized outright, although quartermasters reimbursing Northern farmers and merchants with [[Confederate States of America dollar|Confederate money]] were not well received. Various towns, most notably [[York, Pennsylvania]], were required to pay indemnities in lieu of supplies, under threat of destruction. During the invasion, the Confederates seized some 40 northern [[African Americans]]. A few of them were escaped fugitive [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]], but most were freemen; all were sent south into slavery under guard.<ref name=\"Symonds, pp. 49\u201354\"/><ref name=JWLoewenP350/><ref name=BDSimpson072015/>\n\nOn June 26, elements of Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Early]]'s division of Ewell's Corps occupied the town of Gettysburg after chasing off newly raised Pennsylvania [[militia]] in a series of minor skirmishes. Early laid the borough under tribute, but did not collect any significant supplies. Soldiers burned several railroad cars and a [[covered bridge]], and destroyed nearby rails and [[telegraph]] lines. The following morning, Early departed for adjacent [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]].<ref>Nye, pp. 272\u201378.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in a controversial move, Lee allowed J.E.B. Stuart to take a portion of the army's cavalry and ride around the east flank of the Union army. Lee's orders gave Stuart much latitude, and both generals share the blame for the long absence of Stuart's cavalry, as well as for the failure to assign a more active role to the cavalry left with the army. Stuart and his three best brigades were absent from the army during the crucial phase of the approach to Gettysburg and the first two days of battle. By June 29, Lee's army was strung out in an arc from [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] ({{convert|28|mi|km}} northwest of Gettysburg) to [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]] ({{convert|30|mi|km}} north of Gettysburg) to near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Wrightsville, Pennsylvania|Wrightsville]] on the [[Susquehanna River]].<ref>Symonds, pp. 41\u201343; Sears, pp. 103\u2013106; Esposito, text for Map 94 ([https://archive.fo/20100607100747/http://www.military.com/Resources/ResourceFileView/civilwar_maps_map34_largerview.htm Map 34b] in the online version); Eicher, pp. 504\u2013507; McPherson, p. 649.</ref>\n\nIn a dispute over the use of the forces defending the [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] garrison, Hooker offered his resignation, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] and General-in-Chief [[Henry W. Halleck]], who were looking for an excuse to rid themselves of him, immediately accepted. They replaced Hooker early on the morning of June 28 with Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade, then commander of the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]].<ref>Sears, p. 123; Trudeau, p. 128.</ref>\n\nOn June 29, when Lee learned that the Army of the Potomac had crossed the Potomac River, he ordered a concentration of his forces around [[Cashtown-McKnightstown, Pennsylvania|Cashtown]], located at the eastern base of [[South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] and {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} west of Gettysburg.<ref>Coddington, pp. 181, 189.</ref> On June 30, while part of Hill's Corps was in Cashtown, one of Hill's brigades, North Carolinians under [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]], ventured toward Gettysburg. In his memoirs, Maj. Gen. [[Henry Heth]], Pettigrew's division commander, claimed that he sent Pettigrew to search for supplies in town\u2014especially shoes.<ref>Eicher, pp. 508\u2013509, discounts Heth's claim because the previous visit by Early to Gettysburg would have made the lack of shoe factories or stores obvious. However, many mainstream historians accept Heth's account: Sears, p. 136; Foote, p. 465; Clark, p. 35; Tucker, pp. 97\u201398; Martin, p. 25; Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 25.</ref>\n\nWhen Pettigrew's troops approached Gettysburg on June 30, they noticed Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]] arriving south of town, and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth what he had seen, neither general believed that there was a substantial Union force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant [[Reconnaissance-in-force|reconnaissance in force]] the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, July 1, two brigades of Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.<ref>Eicher, p. 508; Tucker, pp. 99\u2013102.</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union===\n{| style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#9cf;\"|Key commanders ('''[[Army of the Potomac]]''')\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=3>\nFile:George G.

These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at [[Cemetery Hill]], [[Cemetery Ridge]], and [[Culp's Hill]]. Buford understood that if the Confederates could gain control of these heights, Meade's army would have difficulty dislodging them.<ref>Sears, pp. 155\u201358.</ref>\n\n[[File:First shot marker.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|First shot monument]]\nConfederate General Henry Heth's division advanced with two brigades forward, commanded by Brig.

[[William Gamble (USA)|William Gamble's]] cavalry brigade, who raised determined resistance and delaying tactics from behind fence posts with fire from their breechloading [[carbine]]s.<ref>Martin, pp. 80\u201381. The troopers carried single-shot, breechloading carbines manufactured by [[Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company|Sharps]], Burnside, and others. It is a modern myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, they were able to fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle.</ref> Still, by 10:20&nbsp;a.m., the Confederates had pushed the Union cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]] (Maj. Gen. [[John F. Reynolds]]) finally arrived.<ref>Symonds, p. 71; Coddington, p. 266; Eicher, pp. 510\u201311.</ref>\n\nNorth of the pike, Davis gained a temporary success against Brig. Gen. [[Lysander Cutler]]'s brigade but was repulsed with heavy losses in an action around an unfinished railroad bed cut in the ridge. South of the pike, Archer's brigade assaulted through Herbst (also known as McPherson's) Woods. The U.S. [[Iron Brigade]] under Brig. Gen. [[Solomon Meredith]] enjoyed initial success against Archer, capturing several hundred men, including Archer himself.<ref>Tucker, pp. 112\u201317.</ref>\n\nGeneral Reynolds was shot and killed early in the fighting while directing troop and artillery placements just to the east of the woods. Shelby Foote wrote that the Union cause lost a man considered by many to be \"the best general in the army.\"<ref>Foote, p. 468</ref> Maj. Gen. [[Abner Doubleday]] assumed command. Fighting in the Chambersburg Pike area lasted until about 12:30&nbsp;p.m. It resumed around 2:30&nbsp;p.m., when Heth's entire division engaged, adding the brigades of Pettigrew and Col. [[John M. Brockenbrough]].<ref>Tucker, p. 184; Symonds, p. 74; Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 269\u201375.</ref>\n\nAs Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigade came on line, they flanked the 19th Indiana and drove the Iron Brigade back. The 26th North Carolina (the largest regiment in the army with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. By the end of the three-day battle, they had about 152 men standing, the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South.<ref>Busey and Martin, pp. 298, 501.</ref> Slowly the Iron Brigade was pushed out of the woods toward Seminary Ridge. Hill added Maj. Gen. [[William Dorsey Pender]]'s division to the assault, and the I Corps was driven back through the grounds of the [[Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg|Lutheran Seminary]] and Gettysburg streets.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 275\u201393.</ref>\n\nAs the fighting to the west proceeded, two divisions of Ewell's Second Corps, marching west toward Cashtown in accordance with Lee's order for the army to concentrate in that vicinity, turned south on the Carlisle and Harrisburg roads toward Gettysburg, while the Union [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]] (Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]]) raced north on the Baltimore Pike and Taneytown Road. By early afternoon, the U.S. line ran in a semicircle west, north, and northeast of Gettysburg.<ref>Clark, p. 53.</ref>\n\nHowever, the U.S. did not have enough troops; Cutler, whose brigade was deployed north of the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air. The leftmost division of the XI Corps was unable to deploy in time to strengthen the line, so Doubleday was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage his line.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 158.</ref>\n\nAround 2 p.m., the Confederate Second Corps divisions of Maj. Gens. [[Robert E. Rodes]] and Jubal Early assaulted and out-flanked the Union I and XI Corps positions north and northwest of town. The Confederate brigades of Col. [[Edward A. O'Neal]] and Brig. Gen. [[Alfred Iverson, Jr.|Alfred Iverson]] suffered severe losses assaulting the I Corps division of Brig. Gen. [[John C. Robinson]] south of Oak Hill. Early's division profited from a blunder by Brig. Gen. [[Francis C. Barlow]], when he advanced his XI Corps division to Blocher's Knoll (directly north of town and now known as Barlow's Knoll); this represented a [[Salient (military)|salient]]<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 230.</ref> in the corps line, susceptible to attack from multiple sides, and Early's troops overran Barlow's division, which constituted the right flank of the Union Army's position. Barlow was wounded and captured in the attack.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 156\u2013238.</ref>\n\nAs U.S. positions collapsed both north and west of town, Gen. Howard ordered a retreat to the high ground south of town at Cemetery Hill, where he had left the division of Brig. Gen. [[Adolph von Steinwehr]] in reserve.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 294.</ref> Maj. Gen. [[Winfield S. Hancock]] assumed command of the battlefield, sent by Meade when he heard that Reynolds had been killed. Hancock, commander of the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]] and Meade's most trusted subordinate, was ordered to take command of the field and to determine whether Gettysburg was an appropriate place for a major battle.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 337\u201338; Sears, pp. 223\u201325.</ref> Hancock told Howard, \"I think this the strongest position by nature upon which to fight a battle that I ever saw.\" When Howard agreed, Hancock concluded the discussion: \"Very well, sir, I select this as the battle-field.\" Hancock's determination had a morale-boosting effect on the retreating Union soldiers, but he played no direct tactical role on the first day.<ref>Martin, pp. 482\u201388.</ref>\n\nGeneral Lee understood the defensive potential to the Union if they held this high ground. He sent orders to Ewell that Cemetery Hill be taken \"if practicable.\" Ewell, who had previously served under Stonewall Jackson, a general well known for issuing peremptory orders, determined such an assault was not practicable and, thus, did not attempt it; this decision is considered by historians to be a great missed opportunity.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 344; Eicher, p. 517; Sears, p. 228; Trudeau, p. 253. Both Sears and Trudeau record \"if possible.\"</ref>\n\nThe first day at Gettysburg, more significant than simply a prelude to the bloody second and third days, ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged. About one quarter of Meade's army (22,000 men) and one third of Lee's army (27,000) were engaged.<ref>Martin, p. 9, citing Thomas L. Livermore's ''Numbers & Losses in the Civil War in America'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1900).</ref>\n\n==Second day of battle==\n[[File:Gettysburg Day2 Plan.png|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Robert E.

Two of Longstreet's brigades were on the road: Brig. Gen. [[George Pickett]], had begun the 22 mile (35&nbsp;km) march from Chambersburg, while Brig. Gen. E. M. Law had begun the march from Guilford. Both arrived late in the morning. Law completed his 28-mile (45&nbsp;km) march in eleven hours.<ref>Longstreet, From Manassas to Appomattox: Memoirs of the Civil War in America, (Philadelphia:J. B. Lippincott, 1896), pp. 364, 365</ref>\n\nThe Union line ran from Culp's Hill southeast of the town, northwest to Cemetery Hill just south of town, then south for nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1|spell=in}} along Cemetery Ridge, terminating just north of Little Round Top. Most of the XII Corps was on Culp's Hill; the remnants of I and XI Corps defended Cemetery Hill; II Corps covered most of the northern half of Cemetery Ridge; and III Corps was ordered to take up a position to its flank. The shape of the Union line is popularly described as a \"fishhook\" formation.\n\nThe Confederate line paralleled the Union line about a mile (1,600&nbsp;m) to the west on Seminary Ridge, ran east through the town, then curved southeast to a point opposite Culp's Hill. Thus, the Union army had interior lines, while the Confederate line was nearly {{convert|5|mi|km|sigfig=1|spell=in}} long.<ref>Clark, p. 74; Eicher, p. 521.</ref>\n\nLee's battle plan for July 2 called for a general assault of Meade's positions. On the right, Longstreet's First Corps was to position itself to attack the Union left flank, facing northeast astraddle the [[Emmitsburg]] Road, and to roll up the U.S.line. The attack sequence was to begin with Maj. Gens. [[John Bell Hood]]'s and [[Lafayette McLaws]]'s divisions, followed by Maj. Gen. [[Richard H. Anderson]]'s division of Hill's Third Corps.<ref>James Longstreet, From Manassas to Appomattox. (Philadelphia, PA: J. R. Lippincott company, 1896), p. 365.</ref>\n\nOn the left, Lee instructed Ewell to position his Second Corps to attack Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill when he heard the gunfire from Longstreet's assault, preventing Meade from shifting troops to bolster his left. Though it does not appear in either his or Lee's Official Report, Ewell claimed years later that Lee had changed the order to simultaneously attack, calling for only a \"diversion\", to be turned into a full-scale attack if a favorable opportunity presented itself.<ref>Sears, p. 255; Clark, p. 69.</ref><ref name=\"Edward Porter Alexander 1907 p. 408\">Edward Porter Alexander, Military Memoirs of a Confederate. (New York: Charles Scribner & Sons, 1907), p. 408</ref>\n\nLee's plan, however, was based on faulty intelligence, exacerbated by Stuart's continued absence from the battlefield. Though Lee personally reconnoitered his left during the morning, he did not visit Longstreet's position on the Confederate right. Even so, Lee rejected suggestions that Longstreet move beyond Meade's left and attack the Union flank, capturing the supply trains and effectively blocking Meade's escape route.<ref>Longstreet, From Manassas to Appomattox: Memoirs of the Civil War in America, (Philadelphia:J.

Gen. [[Lafayette McLaws]], advanced, they unexpectedly found Maj. Gen. [[Daniel Sickles]]'s III Corps directly in their path. Sickles had been dissatisfied with the position assigned him on the southern end of Cemetery Ridge. Seeing ground better suited for artillery positions a half mile (800&nbsp;m) to the west\u2014 centered at the Sherfy farm's Peach Orchard\u2014he violated orders and advanced his corp to the slightly higher ground along the Emmitsburg Road, moving away from Cemetery Ridge. The new line ran from Devil's Den, northwest to the Peach Orchard, then northeast along the Emmitsburg Road to south of the Codori farm. This created an untenable salient at the Peach Orchard; Brig. Gen. [[Andrew A. Humphreys]]'s division (in position along the Emmitsburg Road) and Maj. Gen. [[David B. Birney]]'s division (to the south) were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread out over a longer front than their small corps could defend effectively.<ref>Pfanz, ''Second Day'', pp. 93\u201397; Eicher, pp. 523\u201324.</ref> The Confederate artillery was ordered to open fire at 3:00&nbsp;p.m.<ref>Longstreet, From Manassas to Appomattox: Memoirs of the Civil War in America, p. 369</ref> After failing to attend a meeting at this time of Meade's corps commanders, Meade rode to Sickles' position and demanded an explanation of the situation. Knowing a Confederate attack was imminent and a retreat would be endangered, Meade refused Sickles' offer to withdraw.<ref>Eicher</ref>\n\nMeade was forced to send 20,000 reinforcements:<ref>Harman, p. 59.</ref> the entire V Corps, Brig. Gen. [[John C. Caldwell]]'s division of the II Corps, most of the XII Corps, and portions of the newly arrived VI Corps. Hood's division moved more to the east than intended, losing its alignment with the Emmitsburg Road,<ref>Harman, p. 57.</ref> attacking Devil's Den and Little Round Top. McLaws, coming in on Hood's left, drove multiple attacks into the thinly stretched III Corps in the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Wheatfield|Wheatfield]] and overwhelmed them in Sherfy's [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Peach Orchard|Peach Orchard]]. McLaws's attack eventually reached Plum Run Valley (the \"Valley of Death\") before being beaten back by the [[Pennsylvania Reserves]] division of the V Corps, moving down from Little Round Top. The III Corps was virtually destroyed as a combat unit in this battle, and Sickles's leg was amputated after it was shattered by a cannonball. Caldwell's division was destroyed piecemeal in the Wheatfield. Anderson's division, coming from McLaws's left and starting forward around 6 p.m., reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge, but could not hold the position in the face of counterattacks from the II Corps, including an almost suicidal bayonet charge by the [[1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry|1st Minnesota]] regiment against a Confederate brigade, ordered in desperation by Hancock to buy time for reinforcements to arrive.<ref>Sears, pp. 312\u201324; Eicher, pp. 530\u201335; Coddington, p. 423.</ref>\n\nAs fighting raged in the Wheatfield and Devil's Den, Col. [[Strong Vincent]] of V Corps had a precarious hold on Little Round Top, an important hill at the extreme left of the Union line. His brigade of four relatively small regiments was able to resist repeated assaults by Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]]'s brigade of Hood's division. Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], had realized the importance of this position, and dispatched Vincent's brigade, an artillery battery, and the 140th New York to occupy Little Round Top mere minutes before Hood's troops arrived. The defense of Little Round Top with a bayonet charge by the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|20th Maine]], ordered by Col. [[Joshua L. Chamberlain]] but possibly led by Lt. [[Holman S. Melcher]], was one of the most fabled episodes in the Civil War and propelled Col. Chamberlain into prominence after the war.<ref>Eicher, pp. 527\u201330; Clark, pp. 81\u201385.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.gdg.org/Research/People/Chamberlain/flash.html|title = Who saved Little Round Top?|access-date = February 21, 2016|publisher = Camp Chase Gazette|last = Morgan|first = James|quote = \"Col.

With reinforcements from the I and XI Corps, Greene's men held off the Confederate attackers, though giving up some of the lower earthworks on the lower part of Culp's Hill.<ref>Eicher, pp. 537\u201338; Sauers, p. 835; Pfanz, ''Culp's Hill'', pp. 205\u201334; Clark, pp. 115\u201316.</ref>\n\nEarly was similarly unprepared when he ordered [[Harry T. Hays]]' and [[Isaac E. Avery]]'s Brigades to attack the Union XI Corps positions on East Cemetery Hill. Once started, fighting was fierce: Col. [[Andrew L. Harris]] of the Union 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, came under a withering attack, losing half his men. Avery was wounded early on, but the Confederates reached the crest of the hill and entered the Union breastworks, capturing one or two batteries. Seeing he was not supported on his right, Hays withdrew. His right was to be supported by [[Robert E. Rodes]]' Division, but Rodes\u2014like Early and Johnson\u2014had not been ordered up in preparation for the attack. He had twice as far to travel as Early; by the time he came in contact with the Union skirmish line, Early's troops had already begun to withdraw.<ref>Report of Maj. Gen. R. E.

The Confederates attacked, and the second fight for Culp's Hill ended around 11 a.m. Harry Pfanz judged that, after some seven hours of bitter combat, \"the Union line was intact and held more strongly than before.\"<ref>Pfanz, ''Culp's Hill'', pp. 284\u2013352; Eicher, pp. 540\u201341; Coddington, pp. 465\u201375.</ref>\n\nLee was forced to change his plans. Longstreet would command Pickett's Virginia division of his own First Corps, plus six brigades from Hill's Corps, in an attack on the U.S. II Corps position at the right center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Prior to the attack, all the artillery the Confederacy could bring to bear on the U.S. positions would bombard and weaken the enemy's line.<ref>Eicher, p. 542; Coddington, pp. 485\u201386.</ref>\n\nMuch has been made over the years of General Longstreet's objections to General Lee's plan. In his memoirs, Longstreet described their discussion as follows:\n\n{{quote|[Lee] rode over after sunrise and gave his orders. His plan was to assault the enemy's left centre by a column to be composed of McLaws's and Hood's divisions reinforced by Pickett's brigades. I thought that it would not do; that the point had been fully tested the day before, by more men, when all were fresh; that the enemy was there looking for us, as we heard him during the night putting up his defences; that the divisions of McLaws and Hood were holding a mile [1,600 m] along the right of my line against twenty thousand men, who would follow their withdrawal, strike the flank of the assaulting column, crush it, and get on our rear towards the Potomac River; that thirty thousand men was the minimum of force necessary for the work; that even such force would need close co-operation on other parts of the line; that the column as he proposed to organize it would have only about thirteen thousand men (the divisions having lost a third of their numbers the day before); that the column would have to march a mile [1,600 m] under concentrating battery fire, and a thousand yards [900 m] under long-range musketry; that the conditions were different from those in the days of Napoleon, when field batteries had a range of six hundred yards [550 m] and musketry about sixty yards [55 m].\n\nHe said the distance was not more than fourteen hundred yards [1280 m]. General Meade's estimate was a mile or a mile and a half [1.6 or 2.4 km] (Captain Long, the guide of the field of Gettysburg in 1888, stated that it was a trifle over a mile). He then concluded that the divisions of McLaws and Hood could remain on the defensive line; that he would reinforce by divisions of the Third Corps and Pickett's brigades, and stated the point to which the march should be directed. I asked the strength of the column. He stated fifteen thousand. Opinion was then expressed that the fifteen thousand men who could make successful assault over that field had never been arrayed for battle; but he was impatient of listening, and tired of talking, and nothing was left but to proceed.<ref>Longstreet, From Manassas to Appomattox: Memoirs of the Civil War in America, (Philadelphia:J.

The monument to the 72nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment (\"Baxter's Philadelphia Fire Zouaves\") appears at right, the Copse of Trees to the left.]]\n\n===The largest artillery bombardment of the war===\nAround 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns began an artillery bombardment that was probably the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Henry Jackson Hunt]], at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.<ref>See discussion of varying gun estimates in [[Pickett's Charge]] article footnote.</ref>\n\n===Pickett's Charge===\nAround 3 p.m., the cannon fire subsided, and 12,500 Southern soldiers stepped from the ridgeline and advanced the three-quarters of a mile (1,200 m) to Cemetery Ridge in what is known to history as \"[[Pickett's Charge]]\". As the Confederates approached, there was fierce flanking artillery fire from Union positions on Cemetery Hill and north of Little Round Top, and musket and canister fire from Hancock's II Corps. In the Union center, the commander of artillery had held fire during the Confederate bombardment (in order to save it for the infantry assault, which Meade had correctly predicted the day before), leading Southern commanders to believe the Northern cannon batteries had been knocked out. However, they opened fire on the Confederate infantry during their approach with devastating results. Nearly one half of the attackers did not return to their own lines.\n\nAlthough the U.S. line wavered and broke temporarily at a jog called the \"Angle\" in a low stone fence, just north of a patch of vegetation called the Copse of Trees, reinforcements rushed into the breach, and the Confederate attack was repulsed. The farthest advance of Brig. Gen. [[Lewis A. Armistead]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[George Pickett]]'s division at the Angle is referred to as the \"[[High-water mark of the Confederacy]]\", arguably representing the closest the South ever came to its goal of achieving independence from the Union via military victory.<ref>McPherson, pp. 661\u201363; Clark, pp. 133\u201344; Symonds, pp. 214\u201341; Eicher, pp. 543\u201349.</ref> Union and Confederate soldiers locked in hand-to-hand combat, attacking with their rifles, bayonets, rocks and even their bare hands. Armistead ordered his Confederates to turn two captured cannons against Union troops, but discovered that there was no ammunition left, the last [[Canister shot|double canister]] shots having been used against the charging Confederates. Armistead was wounded shortly afterward three times.\n\n===Cavalry battles===\nThere were two significant cavalry engagements on July 3. Stuart was sent to guard the Confederate left flank and was to be prepared to exploit any success the infantry might achieve on Cemetery Hill by flanking the U.S. right and hitting their trains and lines of communications. {{convert|3|mi|km|sigfig=1|spell=In}} east of Gettysburg, in what is now called \"East Cavalry Field\" (not shown on the accompanying map, but between the York and Hanover Roads), Stuart's forces collided with U.S. cavalry: Brig. Gen. [[David McMurtrie Gregg]]'s division and Brig. Gen. Custer's brigade. A lengthy mounted battle, including hand-to-hand sabre combat, ensued. Custer's charge, leading the 1st Michigan Cavalry, blunted the attack by [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton's]] brigade, blocking Stuart from achieving his objectives in the U.S. rear.\n\nMeanwhile, after hearing news of the day's victory, Brig. Gen. [[Judson Kilpatrick]] launched a cavalry attack against the infantry positions of Longstreet's Corps southwest of [[Big Round Top]]. Brig. Gen. [[Elon J. Farnsworth]] protested against the futility of such a move, but obeyed orders. Farnsworth was killed in the attack, and his brigade suffered significant losses.<ref>Eicher, pp. 549\u201350; Longacre, pp. 226\u201331, 240-44; Sauers, p. 836; Wert, pp. 272\u201380.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Casualties===\n[[File:Battle of Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|\"The Harvest of Death\": Union dead on the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, photographed July 5 or July 6, 1863, by [[Timothy H.

Union casualties were 23,055 (3,155 killed, 14,531 wounded, 5,369 captured or missing),<ref name=Ucasualties/> while Confederate casualties are more difficult to estimate. Many authors have referred to as many as 28,000 Confederate casualties,<ref>Examples of the varying Confederate casualties for July 1\u20133 are Sears, p. 498 (22,625); Coddington, p. 536 (20,451, \"and very likely more\"); Trudeau, p. 529 (22,874); Eicher, p. 550 (22,874, \"but probably actually totaled 28,000 or more\"); McPherson, p. 664 (28,000); Esposito, map 99 (\"near 28,000\"); Clark, p. 150 (20,448, \"but probably closer to 28,000,\" which he inaccurately cites as a nearly 40% loss); Woodworth, p. 209 (\"at least equal to Meade's and possibly as high as 28,000\"); [https://web.archive.org/web/20110513133710/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/pa002.htm NPS] (28,000)</ref> and Busey and Martin's more recent 2005 work, ''Regimental Strengths and Losses at Gettysburg'', documents 23,231 (4,708 killed, 12,693 wounded, 5,830 captured or missing).<ref name=Ccasualties/> Nearly a third of Lee's general officers were killed, wounded, or captured.<ref>Glatthaar, p. 282.</ref> The casualties for both sides during the entire campaign were 57,225.<ref>Sears, p. 513.</ref>\n\nIn addition to being the deadliest battle of the war in terms of total casualties, Gettysburg also had the highest number of generals killed in action of any battle in the war. The Confederacy lost generals [[Paul Jones Semmes]], [[William Barksdale]], [[William Dorsey Pender]], [[Richard B. Garnett|Richard Garnett]], and [[Lewis Armistead]], as well as [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]] during the retreat after the battle. The Union lost Generals [[John F. Reynolds|John Reynolds]], [[Samuel K. Zook]], [[Stephen H. Weed]], and [[Elon J. Farnsworth]], as well as [[Strong Vincent]], who after being mortally wounded was given a deathbed promotion to brigadier general. Additional senior officer casualties included the wounding of Union Generals [[Dan Sickles]] (lost a leg), [[Francis C. Barlow]], and [[Winfield Scott Hancock]]. For the Confederacy, Major General [[John Bell Hood]] lost the use of his left arm, while Major General [[Henry Heth]] received a shot to the head on the first day of battle (though incapacitated for the rest of the battle, he remarkably survived without long term injuries, credited in part due to his hat stuffed full of paper dispatches). Confederate Generals [[James Kemper]] and [[Isaac R. Trimble]] were severely wounded during Pickett's charge and captured during the Confederate retreat. General [[James J. Archer]], in command of a brigade that most likely was responsible for killing Reynolds, was taken prisoner shortly after Reynolds' death.\n\nThe following tables summarize casualties by corps for the Union and Confederate forces during the three-day battle.<ref>Busey and Martin, pp. 125\u201347, 260\u2013315.

Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Lee had reformed his lines into a defensive position on Seminary Ridge the night of July 3, evacuating the town of Gettysburg. The Confederates remained on the battlefield, hoping that Meade would attack, but the cautious Union commander decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later be criticized. Both armies began to collect their remaining wounded and bury some of the dead. A proposal by Lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by Meade.<ref>Eicher, p. 550; Coddington, pp. 539\u201344; Clark, pp. 146\u201347; Sears, p. 469; Wert, p. 300.</ref>\n\nLee started his Army of Northern Virginia in motion late the evening of July 4 towards [[Fairfield, Pennsylvania|Fairfield]] and Chambersburg. Cavalry under Brig. Gen. [[John D. Imboden]] was entrusted to escort the miles-long wagon train of supplies and wounded men that Lee wanted to take back to Virginia with him, using the route through Cashtown and Hagerstown to [[Williamsport, Maryland]]. Meade's army followed, although the pursuit was half-spirited. The recently rain-swollen Potomac trapped Lee's army on the north bank of the river for a time, but when the Union troops finally caught up, the Confederates had forded the river. The [[Battle of Williamsport|rear-guard action at Falling Waters]] on July 14 added some more names to the long casualty lists, including General Pettigrew, who was mortally wounded.<ref>Clark, pp. 147\u201357; Longacre, pp. 268\u201369.</ref> General [[James Kemper]], severely wounded during Pickett's charge, was captured during Lee's retreat.\n\nIn a brief letter to Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck written on July 7, Lincoln remarked on the two major Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. He continued:\n\n{{Quote|Now, if Gen. Meade can complete his work so gloriously prosecuted thus far, by the literal or substantial destruction of Lee's army, the rebellion will be over.<ref>Coddington, p. 564.</ref>}}\n\nHalleck then relayed the contents of Lincoln's letter to Meade in a telegram. Despite repeated pleas from Lincoln and Halleck, which continued over the next week, Meade did not pursue Lee's army aggressively enough to destroy it before it crossed back over the Potomac River to safety in the South. The campaign continued into Virginia with light engagements until July 23, in the minor [[Battle of Manassas Gap]], after which Meade abandoned any attempts at pursuit and the two armies took up positions across from each other on the [[Rappahannock River]].<ref>Coddington, pp. 535\u201374; Sears, pp. 496\u201397; Eicher, p. 596; Wittenberg et al., ''One Continuous Fight'', pp. 345\u201346..</ref>\n\n===Union reaction to the news of the victory===\nThe news of the Union victory electrified the North. A headline in ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' proclaimed \"VICTORY! [[Battle of Waterloo|WATERLOO]] ECLIPSED!\" New York diarist [[George Templeton Strong]] wrote:<ref>McPherson, p. 664.</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|The results of this victory are priceless. ... The charm of Robert E. Lee's invincibility is broken. The Army of the Potomac has at last found a general that can handle it, and has stood nobly up to its terrible work in spite of its long disheartening list of hard-fought failures. ... [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] are palsied and dumb for the moment at least. ... Government is strengthened four-fold at home and abroad.|George Templeton Strong|Diary, p. 330.}}\n\nHowever, the Union enthusiasm soon dissipated as the public realized that Lee's army had escaped destruction and the war would continue. Lincoln complained to Secretary of the Navy [[Gideon Welles]] that \"Our army held the war in the hollow of their hand and they would not close it!\"<ref>Donald, p. 446; Woodworth, p. 217.</ref> Brig. Gen. [[Alexander S. Webb]] wrote to his father on July 17, stating that such Washington politicians as \"[[Salmon P. Chase|Chase]], [[William H. Seward|Seward]] and others,\" disgusted with Meade, \"write to me that Lee really won that Battle!\"<ref>Coddington, p. 573.</ref>\n\n===Effect on the Confederacy===\nIn fact, the Confederates had lost militarily and also politically. During the final hours of the battle, Confederate Vice President [[Alexander Stephens]] was approaching the Union lines at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], under a [[White flag|flag of truce]]. Although his formal instructions from [[President of the Confederate States|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] had limited his powers to negotiate on prisoner exchanges and other procedural matters, historian [[James M. McPherson]] speculates that he had informal goals of presenting peace overtures. Davis had hoped that Stephens would reach Washington from the south while Lee's victorious army was marching toward it from the north. President Lincoln, upon hearing of the Gettysburg results, refused Stephens's request to pass through the lines. Furthermore, when the news reached London, any lingering hopes of European recognition of the Confederacy were finally abandoned. [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]] wrote, \"The disasters of the rebels are unredeemed by even any hope of success. It is now conceded that all idea of intervention is at an end.\"<ref>McPherson, pp. 650, 664.</ref>\n\nCompounding the effects of the defeat would be the end of the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], which surrendered to Grant's Federal armies in the West on July 4, the day after the Gettysburg battle.\n\nThe immediate reaction of the Southern military and public sectors was that Gettysburg was a setback, not a disaster. The sentiment was that Lee had been successful on July 1 and had fought a valiant battle on July 2\u20133, but could not dislodge the Union Army from the strong defensive position to which it fled. The Confederates successfully stood their ground on July 4 and withdrew only after they realized Meade would not attack them. The withdrawal to the Potomac that could have been a disaster was handled masterfully. Furthermore, the Army of the Potomac had been kept away from Virginia farmlands for the summer and all predicted that Meade would be too timid to threaten them for the rest of the year. Lee himself had a positive view of the campaign, writing to his wife that the army had returned \"rather sooner than I had originally contemplated, but having accomplished what I proposed on leaving the Rappahannock, viz., relieving the Valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his Army north of the Potomac.\" He was quoted as saying to Maj. John Seddon, brother of the Confederate secretary of war, \"Sir, we did whip them at Gettysburg, and it will be seen for the next six months that ''that army'' will be as quiet as a sucking dove.\" Some Southern publications, such as the ''Charleston Mercury'', criticized Lee's actions in the campaign and on August 8, he offered his resignation to President Davis, who quickly rejected it.<ref>Gallagher, ''Lee and His Army'', pp. 86, 93, 102-05; Sears, pp. 501\u2013502; McPherson, p. 665, in contrast to Gallagher, depicts Lee as \"profoundly depressed\" about the battle.</ref>\n\nGettysburg became a postbellum focus of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|\"Lost Cause\"]], a movement by writers such as Edward A. Pollard and Jubal Early to explain the reasons for the Confederate defeat in the war. A fundamental premise of their argument was that the South was doomed because of the overwhelming advantage in manpower and industrial might possessed by the North. However, they claim it also suffered because Robert E. Lee, who up until this time had been almost invincible, was betrayed by the failures of some of his key subordinates at Gettysburg: Ewell, for failing to seize Cemetery Hill on July 1; Stuart, for depriving the army of cavalry intelligence for a key part of the campaign; and especially Longstreet, for failing to attack on July 2 as early and as forcefully as Lee had originally intended. In this view, Gettysburg was seen as a great lost opportunity, in which a decisive victory by Lee could have meant the end of the war in the Confederacy's favor.<ref>Gallagher, ''Lee and His Generals'', pp. 207\u2013208; Sears, p. 503; Woodworth, p. 221. Gallagher's essay \"Jubal A. Early, The Lost Cause, and Civil War History: A Persistent Legacy\" in ''Lee and His Generals'' is a good overview of the Lost Cause movement.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, General Pickett was asked why Confederates lost at Gettysburg.

Although not seen as overwhelmingly significant at the time, particularly since the war continued for almost two years, in retrospect it has often been cited as the [[Turning point of the American Civil War|\"turning point\"]], usually in combination with the fall of Vicksburg the following day.<ref name=TP/> This is based on the observation that after Gettysburg Lee's army conducted no more strategic offensives\u2014his army merely reacted to the initiative of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1864 and 1865\u2014and by the speculative viewpoint of the Lost Cause writers that a Confederate victory at Gettysburg might have resulted in the end of the war.<ref>McPherson, p. 665; Gallagher, ''Lee and His Generals'', pp. 207\u2013208.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=[The Army of the Potomac] had won a victory.

It is inarguable that Lee's offensive on July 3 was turned back decisively and his campaign in Pennsylvania was terminated prematurely (although the Confederates at the time argued that this was a temporary setback and that the goals of the campaign were largely met). However, when the more common definition of \"decisive victory\" is intended\u2014an indisputable military victory of a battle that determines or significantly influences the ultimate result of a conflict\u2014historians are divided. For example, [[David J. Eicher]] called Gettysburg a \"strategic loss for the Confederacy\" and [[James M. McPherson]] wrote that \"Lee and his men would go on to earn further laurels. But they never again possessed the power and reputation they carried into Pennsylvania those palmy summer days of 1863.\"<ref>Eicher, p. 550; McPherson, p. 665</ref>\n\nHowever, Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones wrote that the \"strategic impact of the Battle of Gettysburg was ... fairly limited.\" Steven E. Woodworth wrote that \"Gettysburg proved only the near impossibility of decisive action in the Eastern theater.\" Edwin Coddington pointed out the heavy toll on the Army of the Potomac and that \"after the battle Meade no longer possessed a truly effective instrument for the accomplishments of his task. The army needed a thorough reorganization with new commanders and fresh troops, but these changes were not made until Grant appeared on the scene in March 1864.\" Joseph T. Glatthaar wrote that \"Lost opportunities and near successes plagued the Army of Northern Virginia during its Northern invasion,\" yet after Gettysburg, \"without the distractions of duty as an invading force, without the breakdown of discipline, the Army of Northern Virginia [remained] an extremely formidable force.\" [[Ed Bearss]] wrote, \"Lee's invasion of the North had been a costly failure. Nevertheless, at best the Army of the Potomac had simply preserved the strategic stalemate in the Eastern Theater ...\"<ref>Hattaway and Jones, p. 415; Woodworth, p. xiii; Coddington, p. 573; Glatthaar, p. 288; Bearss, p. 202.</ref> Furthermore, the Confederacy soon proved it was still capable of winning significant victories over the Northern forces in both the East ([[Battle of Cold Harbor]]) and West ([[Battle of Chickamauga]]).\n\nPeter Carmichael refers to the military context for the armies, the \"horrendous losses at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, which effectively destroyed Lee's offensive capacity,\" implying that these cumulative losses were not the result of a single battle. Thomas Goss, writing in the U.S. Army's ''Military Review'' journal on the definition of \"decisive\" and the application of that description to Gettysburg, concludes: \"For all that was decided and accomplished, the Battle of Gettysburg fails to earn the label 'decisive battle'.\"<ref>Carmichael, p. xvii; {{cite journal|last=Goss|first=Major Thomas|date=July\u2013August 2004|title=Gettysburg's \"Decisive Battle\"|journal=Military Review|pages=11\u201316|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/milreview/goss.pdf|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}</ref> The military historian [[John Keegan]] agrees. Gettysburg was a landmark battle, the largest of the war and it would not be surpassed. The Union had restored to it the belief in certain victory, and the loss dispirited the Confederacy. If \"not exactly a decisive battle\", Gettysburg was the end of Confederate use of Northern Virginia as a military buffer zone, the setting for Grant's [[Overland Campaign]].<ref>Keegan, pp. 202, 239.</ref>\n\n===Lee vs. Meade===\n[[File:George G. Meade Standing.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Photo of a balding and bearded George Meade in a military uniform. The somewhat thin figure is standing while holding a kepi.|George G. Meade]]\nPrior to Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee had established a reputation as an almost invincible general, achieving stunning victories against superior numbers\u2014although usually at the cost of high casualties to his army\u2014during the [[Seven Days Battles|Seven Days]], the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]] (including the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]]), [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], and [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]]. Only the [[Maryland Campaign]], with its tactically inconclusive [[Battle of Antietam]], had been less than successful. Therefore, historians have attempted to explain how Lee's winning streak was interrupted so dramatically at Gettysburg. Although the issue is tainted by attempts to portray history and Lee's reputation in a manner supporting different partisan goals, the major factors in Lee's loss arguably can be attributed to: (1) his overconfidence in the invincibility of his men; (2) the performance of his subordinates, and his management thereof; (3) his failing health, and (4) the performance of his opponent, George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac.\n\n[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Photo of white-haired and bearded Robert E. Lee in a double breasted gray uniform with three stars on his collar|Robert E. Lee]]\nThroughout the campaign, Lee was influenced by the belief that his men were invincible; most of Lee's experiences with the Army of Northern Virginia had convinced him of this, including the great victory at Chancellorsville in early May and the rout of the Union troops at Gettysburg on July 1. Since morale plays an important role in military victory when other factors are equal, Lee did not want to dampen his army's desire to fight and resisted suggestions, principally by Longstreet, to withdraw from the recently captured Gettysburg to select a ground more favorable to his army. War correspondent Peter W. Alexander wrote that Lee \"acted, probably, under the impression that his troops were able to carry any position however formidable. If such was the case, he committed an error, such however as the ablest commanders will sometimes fall into.\" Lee himself concurred with this judgment, writing to President Davis, \"No blame can be attached to the army for its failure to accomplish what was projected by me, nor should it be censured for the unreasonable expectations of the public\u2014I am alone to blame, in perhaps expecting too much of its prowess and valor.\"<ref>Sears, pp. 499\u2013500; Glatthaar, p. 287; Fuller, p. 198, states that Lee's \"overweening confidence in the superiority of his soldiers over his enemy possessed him.\"</ref>\n\nThe most controversial assessments of the battle involve the performance of Lee's subordinates. The dominant theme of the Lost Cause writers and many other historians is that Lee's senior generals failed him in crucial ways, directly causing the loss of the battle; the alternative viewpoint is that Lee did not manage his subordinates adequately, and did not thereby compensate for their shortcomings.<ref>For example, Sears, p. 504: \"In the final analysis, it was Robert E. Lee's inability to manage his generals that went to the heart of the failed campaign.\" Glatthaar, pp. 285\u201386, criticizes the inability of the generals to coordinate their actions as a whole. Fuller, p. 198, states that Lee \"maintained no grip over the operations\" of his army.</ref> Two of his corps commanders\u2014[[Richard S. Ewell]] and [[A.P. Hill]]\u2014had only recently been promoted and were not fully accustomed to Lee's style of command, in which he provided only general objectives and guidance to their former commander, [[Stonewall Jackson]]; Jackson translated these into detailed, specific orders to his division commanders.<ref>Fuller, p. 195, for example, refers to orders to Stuart that \"were as usual vague.\" Fuller, p. 197, wrote \"As was [Lee's] custom, he relied on verbal instructions, and left all details to his subordinates.\"</ref> All four of Lee's principal commanders received criticism during the campaign and battle:<ref>Woodworth, pp. 209\u201310.</ref>\n* [[James Longstreet]] suffered most severely from the wrath of the Lost Cause authors, not the least because he directly criticized Lee in postbellum writings and became a [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] after the war. His critics accuse him of attacking much later than Lee intended on July 2, squandering a chance to hit the Union Army before its defensive positions had firmed up. They also question his lack of motivation to attack strongly on July 2 and 3 because he had argued that the army should have maneuvered to a place where it would force Meade to attack them. The alternative view is that Lee was in close contact with Longstreet during the battle, agreed to delays on the morning of July 2, and never criticized Longstreet's performance. (There is also considerable speculation about what an attack might have looked like before Dan Sickles moved the III Corps toward the Peach Orchard.)<ref>Sears, pp. 501\u2013502; McPherson, pp. 656\u201357; Coddington, pp. 375\u201380; A more detailed collection of historical assessments of Longstreet at Gettysburg may be found in [[James Longstreet#Gettysburg]].</ref>\n* [[J.E.B. Stuart]] deprived Lee of cavalry intelligence during a good part of the campaign by taking his three best brigades on a path away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the engagement on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability for the situation originate in the relatively vague orders issued by Lee, but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent for the failure of the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.<ref>Sears, p. 502; A more detailed collection of historical assessments of Stuart in the Gettysburg Campaign may be found in [[J.E.B. Stuart#Gettysburg]].</ref>\n* [[Richard S. Ewell]] has been universally criticized for failing to seize the high ground on the afternoon of July 1. Once again the disagreement centers on Lee's orders, which provided general guidance for Ewell to act \"if practicable.\" Many historians speculate that Stonewall Jackson, if he had survived Chancellorsville, would have aggressively seized Culp's Hill, rendering Cemetery Hill indefensible, and changing the entire complexion of the battle. A differently worded order from Lee might have made the difference with this subordinate.<ref>McPherson, p. 654; Coddington, pp. 317\u201319; Eicher, pp. 517\u201318; Sears, p. 503.</ref>\n* [[A.P. Hill]] has received some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused the battle to begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians point out that Hill kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement in the remainder of the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for [[Pickett's Charge]].<ref>Sears, pp. 502\u2013503.</ref>\n\n[[File:WinfieldSHancock.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Photo of dark-haired and bearded Winfield S. Hancock in a dark uniform with a determined look|Winfield S. Hancock]]\nIn addition to Hill's illness, Lee's performance was affected by heart troubles, which would eventually lead to his death in 1870; he had been diagnosed with [[pericarditis]] by his staff physicians in March 1863, though modern doctors believe he had in fact suffered a heart attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://civilwarmed.blogspot.com/2008/06/medical-department-18-lees-health-at.html|title=Civil War Medicine (and Writing): Medical Department #18 - Lee's Health at Gettysburg|first=Jim|last=Schmidt|date=June 25, 2008|publisher=}}</ref> He wrote to Jefferson Davis that his physical condition prevented him from offering full supervision in the field, and said, \"I am so dull that in making use of the eyes of others I am frequently misled.\"<ref>Sears, p. 500.</ref>\n\nAs a final factor, Lee faced a new and formidable opponent in [[George G. Meade]], and the Army of the Potomac fought well on its home territory. Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as [[Winfield S. Hancock]] to make decisions where and when they were needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some of his predecessors, stood his ground throughout the battle in the face of fierce Confederate attacks.\n\nLee was quoted before the battle as saying Meade \"would commit no blunders on my front and if I make one ... will make haste to take advantage of it.\" That prediction proved to be correct at Gettysburg. Stephen Sears wrote, \"The fact of the matter is that George G. Meade, unexpectedly and against all odds, thoroughly outgeneraled Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg.\" Edwin B. Coddington wrote that the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac received a \"sense of triumph which grew into an imperishable faith in [themselves]. The men knew what they could do under an extremely competent general; one of lesser ability and courage could well have lost the battle.\"<ref>Sears, p. 506; Coddington, p. 573.</ref>\n\nMeade had his own detractors as well. Similar to the situation with Lee, Meade suffered partisan attacks about his performance at Gettysburg, but he had the misfortune of experiencing them in person. Supporters of his predecessor, Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], lambasted Meade before the [[U.S. Congress]]'s [[Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]], where [[Radical Republicans]] suspected that Meade was a [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] and tried in vain to relieve him from command. [[Daniel E. Sickles]] and [[Daniel Butterfield]] accused Meade of planning to retreat from Gettysburg during the battle. Most politicians, including Lincoln, criticized Meade for what they considered to be his half-hearted pursuit of Lee after the battle. A number of Meade's most competent subordinates\u2014[[Winfield S. Hancock]], [[John Gibbon]], [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], and [[Henry J. Hunt]], all heroes of the battle\u2014defended Meade in print, but Meade was embittered by the overall experience.<ref>Sears, pp. 505\u2013507.</ref>\n\n==Battlefield preservation==\n{{Geobox|Protected area\n| image            = CW Arty M1857 Napoleon front.jpg\n| image_caption        = M1857 12-Pounder \"Napoleon\" at Gettysburg National Military Park\n[[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]].\n| country           = United States\n| country_flag        = 1\n| state            = Pennsylvania\n| state_flag         = 1\n| region_type         = County\n| region           = [[Adams County, Pennsylvania|Adams]]\n| municipality        = [[Cumberland Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland]]\n| municipality1        = [[Franklin Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania|Franklin]]<!--Lohr's Hill first artillery shot west of Marsh Creek--><br />[[Straban Township, Pennsylvania|Straban]]\n| parent_type         = Campaign<br />Theater\n| parent           = [[Gettysburg Campaign|Gettysburg]]<br />[[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]]\n| range_type         = Landform\n| range            = <small>[[Devil's Den#Description|Gettysburg sill]] on the [[Newark Group|\"Gettysburg<br />plain\"]]<ref name=Brown>{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Andrew |year=2006 |origyear=1962 |title=GEOLOGY and the Gettysburg Campaign \u2014Eleventh printing |url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/education/es5/es5.pdf |location=Pennsylvania |publisher=Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey |accessdate=2010-02-19 <!--|quote=''the Round Tops, Cemetery Ridge, Cemetery Hill, and [[Culp's Hill|Culps Hill]] \u2026are the '''[[outcrop]] of a diabase sill'''\u2026the '''Gettysburg sill'''\u2026that about 200 million years ago intruded the Triassic sandstones and shales that floor the broad [[Gettysburg plain]].''-->}}</ref> ([[York Haven]] [[Diabase]])<ref name=Smith>{{cite web |last=Smith II |first=R.C. & Keen, R.

Although Gettysburg is one of the best known of all Civil War battlefields, it too faces threats to its preservation and interpretation.

At the [[1913 Gettysburg reunion|50th anniversary (1913)]], veterans re-enacted Pickett's Charge in a spirit of reconciliation, a meeting that carried great emotional force for both sides. At the [[1938 Gettysburg reunion|75th anniversary (1938)]], 2500 veterans attended, and there was a ceremonial mass hand-shake across a stone wall. This was recorded on sound film, and some Confederates can be heard giving the [[Rebel Yell]].\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was depicted in the 1993 film ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'', based on [[Michael Shaara]]'s 1974 novel ''[[The Killer Angels]]''. The film and novel focused primarily on the actions of [[Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]], [[John Buford]], [[Robert E. Lee]], and [[James Longstreet]] during the battle. The first day focused on Buford's cavalry defense, the second day on Chamberlain's defense at [[Little Round Top]], and the third day on [[Pickett's Charge]].\n\nThe south winning the Battle of Gettysburg is a popular premise for a [[point of divergence]] in [[American Civil War alternate histories]]. Here are some examples which either depict or make significant reference to an alternate Battle of Gettysburg (sometimes simply inserting [[fantasy]] or [[sci-fi]] elements in an account of the battle):\n*Novels: ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' by [[Ward Moore]]; ''If the South Had Won the Civil War'' by [[Mackinlay Kantor]]; Civil War Trilogy (''[[Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War|Gettysburg]], [[Grant Comes East]], [[Never Call Retreat]]'') by [[Newt Gingrich]], [[William R.

It is lagered with [[beech]]wood chips in the aging vessel. While beechwood chips are used in the maturation tank, there is little to no flavor contribution from the wood, mainly because they are boiled in [[sodium bicarbonate]] [baking soda] for seven hours for the very purpose of removing any flavor from the wood. The maturation tanks that Anheuser-Busch uses are horizontal and, as such, [[flocculation]] of the yeast occurs much more quickly. Anheuser-Busch refers to this process as a secondary fermentation, with the idea being that the chips give the yeast more surface area to rest on. This is also combined with a [[Brewing#Conditioning|krausening]] procedure that re-introduces wort into the chip tank, therefore reactivating the fermentation process. By placing the beechwood chips at the bottom of the tank, the yeast remains in suspension longer, giving it more time to reabsorb and process green beer flavors, such as [[acetaldehyde]] and [[diacetyl]], that Anheuser-Busch believes are off-flavors which detract from overall drinkability.{{clarify|date=December 2012}}\n[[Image:Budweiser beverage delivery truck Romulus Michigan.JPG|thumb|Budweiser beverage delivery truck, [[Romulus, Michigan]]]]\n\nSome drinkers prefer the lightness of beers like Budweiser and consume it as a refreshment or for its inebriating effects.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://beer.themanroom.com/beer-memberrating.php?&id=54 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109193130/http://beer.themanroom.com/beer-memberrating.php?&id=54 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=January 9, 2009 | publisher=themanroom.com | title=Member's forum Rating}}</ref> Several beer writers consider it to be bland.<ref>[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000776.html Hops to lighten your step] beerhunter.com</ref><ref>[http://www.realbeer.com/news/articles/news-001477.php A Bud by any other name] realbeer.com</ref> The beer is light-bodied with faint sweet notes and negligible bitterness, leading to reviews characterizing it as a \"beer of underwhelming blandness\".<ref>{{cite book | page=84 | title=The Beer Bible | last=Simpson | first = Willie | publisher=John Fairfax Publications | isbn = 978-1-921190-86-5 | year=2007 | location=Sydney}}</ref> Even Adolphus Busch disliked the beer he marketed in the United States.<ref>Edward McClelland, [http://www.salon.com/life/food/eat_drink/2008/07/17/budweiser \"The rise and fall of an American beer\"] ''[[Salon (website)Salon]]'' July 17, 2008</ref> But based upon sales alone, it became the second most popular American brewed [[pale lager]] among North American beer consumers.\n\nBudweiser and ''Bud Light'' are sometimes advertised as [[vegan]] beers, in that their ingredients and conditioning do not use animal by-products.

Most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery. The vicinity of the Bermuda Triangle is amongst the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the Americas, [[Europe]] and the Caribbean islands. Cruise ships and pleasure craft regularly sail through the region, and commercial and private aircraft routinely fly over it.\n\n[[Popular culture]] has attributed various disappearances to the [[paranormal]] or activity by [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]].

Kusche's research revealed a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz's accounts and statements from eyewitnesses, participants, and others involved in the initial incidents. Kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported, such as the disappearance of round-the-world yachtsman [[Donald Crowhurst]], which Berlitz had presented as a mystery, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Another example was the ore-carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an ''Atlantic'' port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the ''Pacific'' Ocean. Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle's mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it. Often his research was simple: he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather, that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories.\n\nKusche concluded that:\n* The number of ships and aircraft reported missing in the area was not significantly greater, proportionally speaking, than in any other part of the ocean.\n* In an area frequented by [[tropical cyclone]]s, the number of disappearances that did occur were, for the most part, neither disproportionate, unlikely, nor mysterious.\n* Furthermore, Berlitz and other writers would often fail to mention such storms or even represent the disappearance as having happened in calm conditions when meteorological records clearly contradict this.\n* The numbers themselves had been exaggerated by sloppy research. A boat's disappearance, for example, would be reported, but its eventual (if belated) return to port may not have been.\n* Some disappearances had, in fact, never happened. One plane crash was said to have taken place in 1937, off [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], in front of hundreds of witnesses; a check of the local papers revealed nothing.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n* The legend of the Bermuda Triangle is a manufactured mystery, perpetuated by writers who either purposely or unknowingly made use of misconceptions, faulty reasoning, and sensationalism.<ref name=\"Kusche, 1975\"/>\n\nIn a 2013 study, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] identified the world's 10 most dangerous waters for shipping, but the Bermuda Triangle was not among them.<ref>{{cite news|url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22806362|title =Study finds shipwrecks threaten precious seas|date =7 June 2013|accessdate = 7 June 2013|publisher =BBC News/science}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2013/0610/Bermuda-Triangle-doesn-t-make-the-cut-on-list-of-world-s-most-dangerous-oceans | title=Bermuda Triangle doesn't make the cut on list of world's most dangerous oceans | work=The Christian Science Monitor | accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Further responses===\nWhen the [[Channel 4|UK Channel 4]] television program ''The Bermuda Triangle'' (1992)<ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/477884 |title=Equinox: The Bermuda Triangle |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref> was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the ''Equinox'' series, the marine insurance market [[Lloyd's of London]] was asked if an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the Bermuda Triangle area. Lloyd's determined that large numbers of ships had not sunk there.<ref name=\"WoodsHole Bermuda\"/> Lloyd's does not charge higher rates for passing through this area. [[United States Coast Guard]] records confirm their conclusion. In fact, the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis.<ref name=\"Kusche, 1975\"/>\n\nThe Coast Guard is also officially skeptical of the Triangle, noting that they collect and publish, through their inquiries, much documentation contradicting many of the incidents written about by the Triangle authors. In one such incident involving the 1972 explosion and sinking of the tanker {{SS|V. A.

This has led to the production of vast amounts of material on topics such as the Bermuda Triangle. They were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate, but its producers continue to market it. Accordingly, they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books, TV specials, and other media that support the Triangle mystery, and against well-researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint.\n\n== Explanation attempts ==\nPersons accepting the Bermuda Triangle as a real phenomenon have offered a number of explanatory approaches.\n\n===Paranormal explanations===\nTriangle writers have used a number of supernatural concepts to explain the events. One explanation pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost continent of [[Atlantis]].

In principle, the term ''borough'' designates a self-governing walled town, although in practice, official use of the term varies widely.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Beowulf - burg.jpg|thumb|A burg in the ''[[Beowulf]]'']]\nThe word ''borough'' derives from common [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/burgz|burgz]]}}, meaning \"fort\": compare with ''bury'', ''burgh'' and ''brough'' (England), {{lang|sco|burgh}} (Scotland), {{lang|de|Burg}} (Germany), {{lang|da|borg}} (Scandinavia), {{lang|nl|burcht}}, ''burg'' (Dutch), {{lang|fy|boarch}} (West Frisian), and the Germanic borrowing present in neighbouring [[Indo-European languages]] such as {{lang|it|borgo}} (Italian), {{lang|fr|bourg}} (French), {{lang|es|burgo}} (Spanish and Portuguese), {{lang|ro|burg}} (Romanian), {{lang|kjv|purg}} ([[Kajkavian]]), {{lang|bn-Latn|durgo}} ({{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c1\u09b0\u09cd\u0997}}, [[Bengali language|Bengali]]), {{lang|hi-Latn|durg}} ({{lang|hi|\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0917}}, Hindi) and {{lang|fa-Latn|arg}} ({{lang|fa|\u0627\u0631\u06af}}, [[Persian language|Persian]]). The incidence of these words as suffixes to place names (for example, [[Aldeburgh]], [[Bamburgh]], [[Tilbury]], [[Tilburg]], [[Strasbourg]] ([[Strossburi]] in the local dialect), [[Luxembourg]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Grundisburgh]], [[Hamburg]], [[Gothenburg]]) usually indicates that they were once fortified settlements.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], boroughs were settlements in England that were granted some [[self-government]]; burghs were the Scottish equivalent. In [[medieval England]], boroughs were also entitled to elect members of [[Parliament of England|parliament]]. The use of the word ''borough'' probably derives from the burghal system of [[Alfred the Great]]. Alfred set up a system of defensive strong points ([[Burh]]s); in order to maintain these particular settlements, he granted them a degree of autonomy. After the [[Norman Conquest]], when certain towns were granted self-governance, the concept of the burh/borough seems to have been reused to mean a self-governing settlement.\n\nThe concept of the borough has been used repeatedly (and often differently) throughout the world. Often, a borough is a single town with its own local government. However, in some cities it is a subdivision of the city (for example, [[Borough (New York City)|New York City]], [[London]], and [[Montreal]]). In such cases, the borough will normally have either limited powers delegated to it by the city's local government, or no powers at all. In other places, such as the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]], ''borough'' designates a whole [[region]]; Alaska's largest borough, the [[North Slope Borough, Alaska|North Slope Borough]], is comparable in area to the entire [[United Kingdom]], although its population is less than that of [[Swanage]] on England's south coast with around 9,600 inhabitants. In [[Australia]], a ''borough'' was once a self-governing small town, but this designation has all but vanished, except for the only remaining borough in the country, which is the [[Borough of Queenscliffe]].\n\nBoroughs as administrative units are to be found in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the United Kingdom, more specifically in England and [[Northern Ireland]]. Boroughs also exist in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]] and formerly in [[Ontario]], in some states of the United States, in [[Israel]], formerly in [[New Zealand]] and only one left in Australia.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''borough'' derives from the [[Old English]] word ''burh'', meaning a [[fortress|fortified]] settlement. Other English derivatives of ''burh'' include ''bury'', ''brough'' and ''burgh''. There are obvious [[cognates]] in other [[Indo-European languages]]. For example; ''burgh'' in [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Middle English]]; ''burg'' in [[German language|German]] and [[Old English]],<ref>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition (2000)</ref> ''borg'' in Scandinavian languages; ''parcus'' in [[Latin]] and ''pyrgos'' in [[Greek language|Greek]], ''\u0628\u0631\u062c'' (borj) in [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nA number of other European languages have cognate words that were borrowed from the Germanic languages during the [[Middle Ages]], including ''brog'' in [[Irish language|Irish]], ''bwr'' or ''bwrc'', meaning \"wall, rampart\" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], ''bourg'' in [[French language|French]], ''burg'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (in Catalonia there is a town named ''Burg''), ''[[wikt:borgo|borgo]]'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''burgo'' in Portuguese and Spanish (hence the place-name [[Burgos]]) and the ''-bor'' of [[Maribor]] in Slovenian.\n\nThe 'burg' element, which means \"castle\" or \"fortress\", is often confused with 'berg' meaning \"hill\" or \"mountain\" (c.f. [[iceberg]], [[inselberg]]). Hence the 'berg' element in [[Bergen]] or [[Heidelberg]] relates to a hill, rather than a fort. In some cases, the 'berg' element in place names has converged towards burg/borough; for instance Farnborough, from ''fernaberga'' (fern-hill).\n\n==Pronunciation==\nIn many parts of England, \"borough\" is pronounced {{IPAc-en|audio=en-borough.ogg|\u02c8|b|\u028cr|\u0259}} as an independent word, and as {{IPAc-en|b|\u0259r|\u0259}} when a suffix of a place-name. As a suffix, it is sometimes spelled \"-brough\".\n\nIn the United States, \"borough\" is pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|\u028cr|o\u028a}}. When appearing as the suffix \"-burg(h)\" in place-names, it is pronounced {{IPAc-en|b|\u025cr|\u0261}}.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], the term \"borough\" is an occasionally used term for a local government area. Currently there is only one borough in Australia, the [[Borough of Queenscliffe]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], although there have been more in the past. However, in some cases it can be integrated into the council's name instead of used as an official title, such as the [[Municipality of Kingborough]] in [[Tasmania]].\n\n===Canada===\n{{main|Municipal government in Canada}}\nIn [[Quebec]], the term '''borough''' is generally used as the English translation of [[arrondissement]], referring to an administrative division of a municipality, or a district. Only eight municipalities in Quebec are divided into boroughs. See [[List of boroughs in Quebec]].\n\nIt was previously used in [[Metropolitan Toronto]], [[Ontario]], to denote suburban municipalities including Scarborough, York, North York, Etobicoke prior to their conversion into cities. The Borough of [[East York]] was the last Toronto municipality to hold this status, relinquishing it upon becoming part of the [[City of Toronto]] on January 1, 1998.\n\n===Colombia===\nThe [[Municipalities of Colombia|Colombian Municipalities]] are subdivided into boroughs with a local executive and an administrative board for local government.\nThese Boroughs are divided in neighborhoods.\n\nBy the way the principal cities had boroughs with the same features as the European or American cities, including [[Soacha]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]], [[La Estrella, Colombia|La Estrella]], [[Sabaneta, Antioquia|Sabaneta]], [[Envigado]] and [[Itag\u00fc\u00ed]] on [[Medell\u00edn]].\n\n===Republic of Ireland===\n{{anchor|Ireland}}\nThe [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]] replaced the urban-only second-tier local government units with new urban and rural units termed \"[[municipal district (Ireland)|municipal district]]s\". The abolished units included five which were termed \"boroughs\", namely [[Clonmel]], [[Drogheda]], [[Kilkenny]], [[Sligo]], and [[Wexford]]. However, the municipal districts containing four of these are styled \"borough districts\"; the exception is Kilkenny, whose district is the \"Municipal District of Kilkenny City\", because of Kilkenny's [[City status in Ireland|city status]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0001/sec0019.html#sec19|title=Local Government Reform Act 2014, Section 19 (insertion of section 22A into the Local Government Act 2001)|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nEarlier Irish boroughs include the 117 parliamentary boroughs of the [[Irish House of Commons]], of which 80 were disfranchised by the [[Acts of Union 1800]] and all but 11 abolished under the [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]]. The six largest of those eleven became [[county borough]]s under the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]], of which those in the Republic were reclassed as \"cities\" under the [[Local Government Act 2001]]. [[Galway]] was a borough from 1937 until promoted to county borough in 1985,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1937/en/act/prv/0003|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140811192019/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1937/en/act/prv/0003|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 August 2014|title=Local Government (Galway) Act, 1937|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1985/en/act/pub/0007/index.html|title=Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref> and [[Corporation of D\u00fan Laoghaire|D\u00fan Laoghaire was a borough]] from 1930 until merged into [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]] county in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1930/en/act/pub/0027|title=Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=5 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723000338/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1930/en/act/pub/0027/|archivedate=23 July 2015|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0031/|title=Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=5 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811065338/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0031/|archivedate=11 August 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Israel===\nUnder Israeli law, inherited from [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] municipal law, the possibility of creating a municipal borough exists. However, no borough was actually created under law until 2005\u20132006, when [[Neve Monosson]] and [[Maccabim-Re'ut]], both communal settlements (Heb: '''''yishuv kehilati''''') founded in 1953 and 1984, respectively, were declared to be autonomous municipal boroughs (Heb: '''''vaad rova ironi'''''), within their mergers with the towns of [[Yehud]] and [[Modi'in]]. Similar structures have been created under different types of legal status over the years in Israel, notably [[Qiryat Chaim|Kiryat Haim]] in [[Haifa]], [[Jaffa]] in [[Tel Aviv-Yafo]] and [[Ramot]] and [[Gilo]] in [[Jerusalem]]. However, Neve Monosson is the first example of a full municipal borough actually declared under law by the Minister of the Interior, under a model subsequently adopted in [[Maccabim-Re'ut]] as well.\n\nIt is the declared intention of the Interior Ministry to use the borough mechanism in order to facilitate municipal mergers in Israel, after a 2003 wide-reaching merger plan, which, in general, ignored the sensitivities of the communal settlements, and largely failed.\n\n===Mexico===\nIn [[Mexico]] as translations from [[English language|English]] to Spanish applied to [[Mexico City]], the word ''borough'' has resulted in a '''delegaci\u00f3n''' (delegation), referring to the 16 administrative areas within the Mexican Federal District. Also the [[Municipalities of Mexico|municipalities]] of some [[States of Mexico|states]] are administratively subdivided into boroughs, as shown in [[Municipality of Mexicali#Boroughs]]. ('''see''': [[Boroughs of Mexico]] and [[Municipalities of Mexico City]])\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the municipalities of [[Rotterdam]] and [[Amsterdam]] are divided into administrative boroughs, or [[deelgemeente]]n, which have their own borough council and a borough mayor. Other large cities are usually divided into districts, or [[Stadsdeel|stadsdelen]], for census purposes.\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[New Zealand]] formerly used the term borough to designate self-governing towns of more than 1,000 people, although 19th century census records show many boroughs with populations as low as 200.<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~sooty/nzcensus1881.html 1881 census summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115213109/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~sooty/nzcensus1881.html |date=2009-01-15 }}</ref> A borough of more than 20,000 people could become a city by proclamation. Boroughs and cities were collectively known as municipalities, and were [[enclave]]s separate from their surrounding counties. Boroughs proliferated in the suburban areas of the larger cities: By the 1980s there were 19 boroughs and three cities in the area that is now the City of Auckland.\n\nIn the 1980s, some boroughs and cities began to be merged with their surrounding counties to form [[district]]s with a mixed urban and rural population. A [[1989 local government reforms|nationwide reform of local government in 1989]] completed the process. Counties and boroughs were abolished and all boundaries were redrawn. Under the new system, most territorial authorities cover both urban and rural land. The more populated councils are classified as cities, and the more rural councils are classified as districts. Only [[Kawerau]] District, an enclave within [[Whakatane|Whakatane District]], continues to follow the tradition of a small town council that does not include surrounding rural area.\n\n===Trinidad and Tobago===\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]], a Borough is a unit of [[Local Government]]. There are 3 boroughs in The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago:\n* [[Chaguanas]]\n* [[Arima]]\n* [[Point Fortin]]\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====England and Wales====\n{{main|History of local government in England|Borough status in the United Kingdom}}\n\n=====Ancient and municipal boroughs=====\n{{Main|Ancient borough|Municipal borough}}\nDuring the medieval period many towns were granted self-governance by the Crown, at which point they became referred to as boroughs. The formal status of borough came to be conferred by [[Royal Charter]]. These boroughs were generally governed by a self-selecting corporation (i.e., when a member died or resigned his replacement would be by [[co-option]]). Sometimes boroughs were governed by [[bailiffs]] or headboroughs.\n\nDebates on the Reform Bill (eventually the [[Reform Act 1832]]) had highlighted the variations in systems of governance of towns, and a [[Royal Commission]] was set up to investigate the issue. This resulted in a regularisation of municipal government ([[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]). 178 of the ancient boroughs were reformed as ''municipal boroughs'', with all municipal corporations to be elected according to a standard franchise based on property ownership. The unreformed boroughs either lapsed in borough status, or were reformed (or abolished) at a later time. Several new municipal boroughs were formed in the new industrial cities after the bill enacted, according to the provisions of the bill.\n\nAs part of a large-scale reform of local government in England and Wales [[Local Government Act 1972|in 1974]], municipal boroughs were finally abolished (having become increasingly irrelevant). However, the civic traditions of many boroughs were continued by the grant of a [[Royal Charter|charter]] to their successor district councils. In smaller boroughs, a [[Parish councils in England|town council]] was formed for the area of the abolished borough, while [[charter trustees]] were formed in other former boroughs. In each case, the new body was allowed to use the regalia of the old corporation, and appoint ceremonial office holders such as sword and mace bearers as provided in their original charters. The council or trustees may apply for an [[Order in Council]] or [[Royal Licence]] to use the former borough [[coat of arms]].\n\n=====Parliamentary boroughs=====\n{{Further|Reform Act 1832}}\n\n[[Simon de Montfort's Parliament|From 1265]], two burgesses from each borough were summoned to the [[Parliament of England]], alongside two [[knight]]s from each [[county]]. Thus parliamentary constituencies were derived from the ancient boroughs. Representation in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] was decided by the House itself, which resulted in boroughs being established in some small settlements for the purposes of parliamentary representation, despite their possessing no actual corporation.\n\nAfter the Reform Act, which disenfranchised many of the [[rotten borough]]s (boroughs that had declined in importance, had only a small population, and had only a handful of eligible voters), parliamentary constituencies began to diverge from the ancient boroughs. While many ancient boroughs remained as municipal boroughs, they were disenfranchised by the Reform Act.\n\n=====County boroughs=====\n{{Main|County borough}}\n\nThe [[Local Government Act 1888]] established a new sort of borough \u2013 the county borough. These were designed to be 'counties-to-themselves'; administrative divisions to sit alongside the new administrative counties. They allowed urban areas to be administered separately from the more rural areas. They, therefore, often contained pre-existing municipal boroughs, which thereafter became part of the second tier of local government, below the administrative counties and county boroughs.\n\nThe county boroughs were, like the municipal boroughs, abolished in 1974, being reabsorbed into their parent counties for administrative purposes.\n\n=====Metropolitan boroughs=====\n{{Main|Metropolitan borough}}\n\nIn 1899, as part of a reform of local government in the [[County of London]], the various parishes in London were reorganised as new entities, the 'metropolitan boroughs'. These were reorganised further when [[Greater London]] was formed out of Middlesex and the County of London in 1965.\n\nWhen the new metropolitan counties ([[Greater Manchester]], [[Merseyside]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[Tyne and Wear]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], and [[West Yorkshire]]) were created in 1974, their sub-divisions also became metropolitan boroughs; in many cases these metropolitan boroughs recapitulated abolished county boroughs (for example, [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]]). The metropolitan boroughs possessed slightly more autonomy from the metropolitan county councils than the shire county districts did from their county councils.\n\nWith the abolition of the metropolitan county councils in 1986, these metropolitan boroughs became independent, and continue to be so at present.\n\n=====Other current uses=====\nElsewhere in England a number of [[districts of England|districts]] and [[unitary authority]] areas are called \"borough\". Until 1974, this was a status that denoted towns with a certain type of local government (a [[municipal corporation]], or a self-governing body). Since 1974, it has been a purely ceremonial style granted by royal charter to districts which may consist of a single town or may include a number of towns or rural areas. Borough status entitles the council chairman to bear the title of [[Mayors in England|mayor]]. Districts may apply to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]] for the grant of borough status upon advice of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]].\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nIn [[Northern Ireland]], local government was reorganised in 1973. Under the legislation that created the 26 [[districts of Northern Ireland]], a district council whose area included an existing [[municipal borough]] could resolve to adopt the charter of the old municipality and thus continue to enjoy borough status. Districts that do not contain a former borough can apply for a charter in a similar manner to English districts.\n\n====Scotland====\n{{hatnote|See: [[Burgh]]}}\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Borough (United States)}}\nIn the United States, a borough is a unit of [[local government]] below the level of the [[U.S. state|state]].

It has been suggested that the town's name comes from an archaic word in the [[Cornish language]] \"bod\" (meaning a dwelling; the later word is \"bos\") and a contraction of \"menegh\" (monks). The \"monks' dwelling\" may refer to an early monastic settlement instituted by St. Guron, which [[Saint Petroc|St. Petroc]] took as his site. Guron is said to have departed to [[St Goran]] on the arrival of Petroc.\n\nThe hamlets of Cooksland, [[Dunmere, Cornwall|Dunmere]] and [[Turfdown]] are in the parish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.explorebritain.info/browse/cornwall/ |title=Cornwall; Explore Britain|publisher=Explorebritian.info|accessdate=17 September 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602231052/http://www.explorebritain.info/browse/cornwall/ |archivedate=2 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Saint Petroc|St. Petroc]] founded a monastery in Bodmin in the 6th century<ref>[[Doble, G.

The first was the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]] when a Cornish army, led by [[Michael An Gof]], a [[blacksmith]] from [[St. Keverne]] and [[Thomas Flamank]], a [[lawyer]] from Bodmin, marched to [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] in London where they were eventually defeated by 10,000 men of the King's army under Baron Daubeny. Then, in the autumn of 1497, [[Perkin Warbeck]] tried to usurp the throne from [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. Warbeck was proclaimed King Richard IV in Bodmin but Henry had little difficulty crushing the uprising. In 1549, Cornishmen, allied with other rebels in neighbouring [[Devon]], rose once again in rebellion when the staunchly Protestant [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] tried to impose a new [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]]. The lower classes of Cornwall and Devon were still strongly attached to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religion and again a Cornish army was formed in Bodmin which marched across the border into Devon to lay siege to [[Exeter]]. This became known as the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]]. Proposals to translate the Prayer Book into Cornish were suppressed and in total 4,000 people were killed in the rebellion.<ref>Sturt, John (1987) Revolt in the West: the Western Rebellion of 1549. Exeter: Devon Books</ref>\n\n===Bodmin Borough Police===\nThe Borough of Bodmin was one of the 178 municipal boroughs which under the auspices of the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] was mandated to create an electable council and a Police Watch Committee responsible for overseeing a police force in the town. The new system directly replaced the Parish Constables that had policed the borough since time immemorial and brought paid, uniformed and accountable law enforcement for the first time. Bodmin Borough Police was the municipal police force for the Borough of Bodmin from 1836 to 1866. The creation of the [[Cornwall Constabulary]] in 1857 put pressure on smaller municipal police forces to merge with the county. The two-man force of Bodmin came under threat almost immediately, but it would take until 1866 for the Mayor of Bodmin and the Chairman of the Police Watch Committee to agree on the terms of amalgamation. After a public enquiry, the force was disbanded in January 1866 and policing of the borough was deferred to the county from thereon.\n\n===\"Bodmin Town\"===\nThe song \"Bodmin Town\" was collected from the Cornishman William Nichols at [[Whitchurch, Devon|Whitchurch]], [[Devon]], in 1891 by [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] who published a version in his ''A Garland of Country Song'' (1924).<ref>A more authentic version based on the Baring-Gould MSS. appeared in 1974 in Gordon Hitchcock's ''Songs of the West Country''.--Dave Arthur's notes on Martyn Wyndham Read's ''Andy's Gone'' Broadside BRO 134.</ref>\n\n==Churches==\n\n===Parish church of St Petroc===\n{{Main article|St Petroc's Church, Bodmin}}\n[[File:St Petroc's Church, Bodmin - geograph.org.uk - 51028.jpg|thumb|St Petroc's Church]]\nThe existing church building is dated 1469\u201372 and was until the building of [[Truro Cathedral]] the largest church in Cornwall.

The aim is to carry the ball from the \"Salting Pool\" via the old [[A30 road|A30]], along Callywith Road, then through Castle Street, Church Square and Honey Street to finish at the Turret Clock in Fore Street.

For his services to the [[King of Spain]], he was granted a vast stretch of land on the east shore of San Francisco Bay (the ''contra costa'', \"opposite shore\") for a ranch, including that portion that now comprises the City of Berkeley.\n\nLuis Peralta named his holding \"[[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]]\". The primary activity of the ranch was raising cattle for meat and hides, but hunting and farming were also pursued. Eventually, Peralta gave portions of the ranch to each of his four sons. What is now Berkeley lies mostly in the portion that went to Peralta's son [[Jos\u00e9 Domingo Peralta|Domingo]], with a little in the portion that went to another son, Vicente. No artifact survives of the Domingo or Vicente ranches, but their names survive in Berkeley street names (Vicente, Domingo, and Peralta). However, legal title to all land in the City of Berkeley remains based on the original Peralta land grant.\n\nThe Peraltas' Rancho San Antonio continued after [[Alta California]] passed from Spanish to Mexican sovereignty after the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. However, the advent of U.S. sovereignty after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], and especially, the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], saw the Peraltas' lands quickly encroached on by [[squatter]]s and diminished by dubious legal proceedings. The lands of the brothers Domingo and Vicente were quickly reduced to reservations close to their respective ranch homes. The rest of the land was surveyed and parceled out to various American claimants (''See'' [[Kellersberger's Map]]).\n\nPolitically, the area that became Berkeley was initially part of a vast [[Contra Costa County]]. On March 25, 1853, Alameda County was created from a division of Contra Costa County, as well as from a small portion of [[Santa Clara County]]. The area that became Berkeley was then the northern part of the \"Oakland Township\" subdivision of Alameda County. During this period, \"Berkeley\" was mostly a mix of open land, farms, and ranches, with a small, though busy, wharf by the bay.\n\n[[File:Indian rock.jpg|thumb|center|800px|The city as seen from [[Indian Rock Park]] in the North Berkeley Hills. Berkeley is in the foreground, with the [[Berkeley Marina]] and [[C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Park]] just beyond.]]\n\n===Late 19th century===\nIn 1866, Oakland's private [[College of California]] looked for a new site. It settled on a location north of Oakland along the foot of the [[Berkeley Hills|Contra Costa Range]] (later called the Berkeley Hills) astride [[Strawberry Creek]], at an elevation about {{convert|500|ft}} above the bay, commanding a view of the Bay Area and the Pacific Ocean through the [[Golden Gate]].\n\nAccording to the ''Centennial Record of the University of California'', \"In 1866\u2026at [[Founders' Rock]], a group of College of California men watched two ships standing out to sea through the [[Golden Gate]]. One of them, [[Frederick Billings]], thought of the lines of the Anglo-Irish Anglican Bishop [[George Berkeley]], 'westward the course of empire takes its way,' and suggested that the town and college site be named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Irish philosopher.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Stadtman |editor-first=Verne |title=The Centennial Record of the University of California |publisher=[[Regents of the University of California]] |year=1967 |page=114 |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4v19n9zb;NAAN=13030&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00219&toc.depth=1&toc.id=div00219&brand=calisphere}}</ref> The philosopher's name is pronounced ''BARK-lee'', but the city's name, to accommodate [[American English]], is pronounced ''BERK-lee''.<ref>{{cite web |title=George Berkeley \u2013 Biography |publisher=[[European Graduate School]] |url=http://www.egs.edu/library/george-berkeley/biography/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225225047/http://www.egs.edu/library/george-berkeley/biography/ |archivedate=February 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe College of California's ''College Homestead Association'' planned to raise funds for the new campus by selling off adjacent parcels of land. To this end, they laid out a plat and street grid that became the basis of Berkeley's modern street plan. Their plans fell far short of their desires, and they began a collaboration with the State of California that culminated in 1868 with the creation of the public [[University of California]].\n\nAs construction began on the new site, more residences were constructed in the vicinity of the new campus. At the same time, a settlement of residences, saloons, and various industries grew around the wharf area called \"[[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]]\". A [[horsecar]] ran from [[Temescal, Oakland, California|Temescal]] in Oakland to the university campus along what is now [[Telegraph Avenue]]. The first post office opened in 1872.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|601}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1870s, the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] reached its terminus in Oakland. In 1876, a branch line of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], was laid from a junction with the mainline called Shellmound (now a part of Emeryville) into what is now [[Downtown Berkeley, California|downtown Berkeley]]. That same year, the mainline of the transcontinental railroad into Oakland was re-routed, putting the right-of-way along the bay shore through Ocean View.\n\nThere was a strong prohibition movement in Berkeley at this time. In 1876, the state enacted the ''mile limit law'', which forbade sale or public consumption of alcohol within one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) of the new University of California.<ref>Berkeley Gazette. 1900 April 9</ref> Then, in 1899 Berkeley residents voted to make their city an alcohol-free zone. Scientists, scholars and religious leaders spoke vehemently of the dangers of alcohol.<ref>Berkeley 1900: Daily Life at the Turn of the Century, by Richard Schwartz. 2000. page 187</ref>\n\nIn 1878, the people of Ocean View and the area around the university campus, together with local farmers, [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as the Town of Berkeley. The first elected trustees of the town were the slate of [[Denis Kearney]]'s [[Workingman's Party]], who were particularly favored in the working class area of the former Ocean View, now called \"West Berkeley\". The area near the university became known for a time as \"East Berkeley\".\n\nThe modern age came quickly to Berkeley, no doubt due to the influence of the university. [[Electric light]]s were in use by 1888. The telephone had already come to town. Electric [[streetcar]]s soon replaced the [[horsecar]]. A silent film of one of these early streetcars in Berkeley can be seen at the [[Library of Congress]] website: \"A Trip To Berkeley, California\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/00694420/|title=Trip to Berkeley, California, Lcmp003 M3a29754|publisher=Library of Congress}}<!-- https://www.loc.gov/collections/san-francisco-earthquake-and-fire-1897-to-1916/?q=lcmp003%20m3a29754 --></ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\n[[File:Oakland 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of Oakland and Berkeley area in 1917]]\n\nBerkeley's slow growth ended abruptly with the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|Great San Francisco earthquake of 1906]]. The town and other parts of the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] escaped serious damage, and thousands of refugees flowed across the Bay.  Among them were most of San Francisco's painters and sculptors, who between 1907 and 1911 created one of the largest art colonies west of Chicago.  Artist and critic [[Jennie V.

They bear those names today, a legacy of the failed referendum.\n\nIn 1909, the citizens of Berkeley adopted a new charter, and the Town of Berkeley became the City of Berkeley. Rapid growth continued up to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Crash of 1929]]. The [[Great Depression]] hit Berkeley hard, but not as hard as many other places in the U.S., thanks in part to the university.\n\nOn September 17, 1923, [[1923 Berkeley Fire|a major fire]] swept down the hills toward the university campus and the downtown section. Around 640 structures burned before a late afternoon sea breeze stopped its progress, allowing firefighters to put it out.\n\nThe next big growth occurred with the advent of [[World War II]], when large numbers of people moved to the Bay Area to work in the many war industries, such as the immense [[Kaiser Shipyards]] in nearby [[Richmond, California|Richmond]]. One who moved out, but played a big role in the outcome of the War was U.C. Professor and Berkeley resident [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. During the war, an Army base, [[Camp Ashby]], was temporarily sited in Berkeley.\n\n[[File:Berkeley, California. University of California Lawn Forum.

In the 1950s, [[McCarthyism]] induced the university to demand a loyalty oath from its professors, many of whom refused to sign the oath on the principle of freedom of thought. In 1960, a U.S. House committee ([[HUAC]]) came to San Francisco to investigate the influence of communists in the Bay Area. Their presence was met by protesters, including many from the university. Meanwhile, a number of U.C. students became active in the [[civil rights movement]]. Finally, in 1964, the university provoked a massive student protest by banning distribution of political literature on campus. This protest became the [[Free Speech Movement]]. As the [[Vietnam War]] rapidly escalated in the ensuing years, so did student activism at the university, particularly that organized by the [[Vietnam Day Committee]].\n\n{{See also|1960s Berkeley protests}}\n\nBerkeley is strongly identified with the rapid social changes, civic unrest, and political upheaval that characterized the late 1960s.<ref>[http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1054/files/berkeley%20shattuck%20context%2005-28-2015.pdf \"Shattuck Avenue: Commercial Corridor Historic Context and Survey\"]. City of Berkeley. Retrieved October 5, 2017.</ref> In that period, Berkeley\u2014especially [[Telegraph Avenue]]\u2014became a focal point for the [[hippie]] movement, which spilled over the Bay from San Francisco. Many hippies were apolitical drop-outs, rather than students, but in the heady atmosphere of Berkeley in 1967\u20131969 there was considerable overlap between the hippie movement and the radical left. An iconic event in the Berkeley Sixties scene was a conflict over a parcel of university property south of the contiguous campus site that came to be called \"[[People's Park, Berkeley|People's Park]].\"\n\n[[File:People's-Park.jpg|thumbnail|left|People's Park with Unit 2 in the background]]\n\nThe battle over the disposition of People's Park resulted in a month-long occupation of Berkeley by the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] on orders of then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. In the end, the park remained undeveloped, and remains so today. A spin-off, ''People's Park Annex'', was established at the same time by activist citizens of Berkeley on a strip of land above the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] subway construction along Hearst Avenue northwest of the U.C. campus. The land had also been intended for development, but was turned over to the city by BART and is now [[Ohlone Park]].\n\nThe era of large public protest in Berkeley waned considerably with the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. While the 1960s were the heyday of liberal activism in Berkeley, it remains one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic cities in the United States.\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\n====Housing and zoning changes====\n[[File:Berkeley BART Station 1973 Postcard.jpg|thumb|Shattuck Avenue at Center Street in downtown Berkeley as seen in 1973]]\nThe Berkeley population declined in the 1970s, partly due to an exodus to the suburbs. Some moved because of the rising cost of living throughout the Bay Area, and others because of the decline and disappearance of many industries in West Berkeley.\n\nIncreasing enrollment at the university led to replacement of older buildings by large apartment buildings, especially in older parts of the city near the University and downtown. Increasing enrollment also led the university to wanting to redevelop certain places of Berkeley, especially Southside, but more specifically People's Park.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Don|date=|title=Iconography and locational conflict from the underside: Free speech, People's Park, and the politics of homelessness in Berkeley, California|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/096262989290046V|journal=Political Geography|volume=2|pages=152\u2013169|via=|doi=10.1016/0962-6298(92)90046-V|year=1992}}</ref> [[Preservationists]] passed the Neighborhood Protection Ordinance in 1973 by ballot measure and the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance in 1974 by City Council.

This era also saw major developments in Berkeley's environmental and food culture. Berkeley's last Republican mayor, [[Wallace J.S. Johnson]], left office in 1971. [[Alice Waters]] opened [[Chez Panisse]] in 1971.  The first curbside recycling program in the U.S. was started by the [[Ecology Center (Berkeley)|Ecology Center]] in 1973.

Exposed in the Berkeley Hills are cherts and shales of the Claremont Formation (equivalent to the [[Monterey Formation]]), conglomerate and sandstone of the Orinda Formation and lava flows of the Moraga Volcanics. Of similar age to the Moraga Volcanics (extinct), within the Northbrae neighborhood of Berkeley, are outcroppings of erosion resistant rhyolite. These [[rhyolite]] formations can be seen in several city parks and in the yards of a number of private residences. [[Indian Rock Park]] in the northeastern part of Berkeley near the Arlington/Marin Circle features a large example.\n\n====Earthquakes====\nBerkeley is traversed by the [[Hayward Fault Zone]], a major branch of the [[San Andreas Fault]] to the west. No large earthquake has occurred on the Hayward Fault near Berkeley in historic times (except possibly in 1836), but seismologists warn about the geologic record of large temblors several times in the deeper past. The current assessment is that a Bay Area earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater within the next 30 years is likely, with the Hayward Fault having the highest likelihood among faults in the Bay Area of being the epicenter.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/ucerf/|title = 2008 Bay Area Earthquake Probabilities|date = |accessdate = June 26, 2015|website = USGS|publisher = USGS|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150629012606/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/ucerf/|archive-date = June 29, 2015|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Moreover, like much of the Bay Area, Berkeley has many areas of some risk to [[soil liquefaction]], with the flat areas closer to the shore at low to high susceptibility.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/alameda/|title = U.S. Geological Survey Liquefaction Hazard Maps|accessdate = February 18, 2015|website = U.S. Geological Survey|publisher = USGS|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150219045641/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/alameda/|archive-date = February 19, 2015|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1868 Hayward earthquake]] did occur on the southern segment of the Hayward Fault<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1868/10/22/87584244.pdf |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 22, 1868 |title=Earthquake in San Francisco and Neighboring Places }}</ref> in the vicinity of today's city of [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] (hence, how the fault got its name). This quake destroyed the county seat of Alameda County then located in [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] and it subsequently moved to Oakland. It was strongly felt in San Francisco, causing major damage.  It was regarded as the \"Great San Francisco earthquake\" prior to 1906. It produced a furrow in the ground along the fault line in Berkeley, across the grounds of the new [[State Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind]] then under construction, which was noted by one early University of California professor. Although no significant damage was reported to most of the few Berkeley buildings of the time, the 1868 quake did destroy the vulnerable adobe home of Domingo Peralta in north Berkeley.<ref>Lawson, A. C. (ed.), ''The California Earthquake of April 18, 1906'', 1908, Reprinted 1969 by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. This is a comprehensive report on the 1906 earthquake, published by the State Earthquake Investigation Commission, and comprises two volumes and an atlas. It contains a discussion of the 1868 Hayward Fault earthquake and its effects, and includes a number of photos taken by Lawson himself of damage in Berkeley caused by the 1906 quake. The report is available from the USGS. {{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/events/1906calif/18april/references.php |title=1906 Earthquake \u2013 References |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov}}</ref>\n\nToday, evidence of the Hayward Fault's \"creeping\" is visible at various locations in Berkeley. Cracked roadways, sharp jogs in streams, and springs mark the fault's path. However, since it cuts across the base of the hills, the creep is often concealed by or confused with slide activity. Some of the slide activity itself, however, results from movement on the Hayward Fault.\n\nA notorious segment of the Hayward Fault runs lengthwise down the middle of [[California Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]] at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon on the University of California campus.<ref>[https://haywardfaultucberkeley.pressbooks.com/chapter/the-california-memorial-stadium/ ''The Hayward Fault at the Campus of University of California, Berkeley: A Guide to a Brief Walking Tour'', Horst Rademacher, Pressbooks, 2017, Chapter 5]</ref> Photos and measurements<ref>[http://seismo.berkeley.edu/hayward/ucb_campus.htm]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> show the movement of the fault through the stadium.\n\n===Climate===\nBerkeley has a cool summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (type [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|Csb]] in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]), with dry summers and wet winters. Berkeley's location directly opposite the [[Golden Gate]] ensures that typical eastward [[San Francisco fog|fog]] flow blankets the city more often than its neighbors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ephemeris.sjaa.net/0107/b.html |title=Jane Houston Jones.

SJAA Ephemeris July 2001 |publisher=Ephemeris.sjaa.net |date=July 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}</ref> The summers are cooler than a typical Mediterranean climate thanks to [[upwelling]] ocean currents along the California coast. These help produce cool and foggy nights and mornings.\n\nWinter is punctuated with rainstorms of varying ferocity and duration, but also produces stretches of bright sunny days and clear cold nights. It does not normally snow, though occasionally the hilltops get a dusting. Spring and fall are transitional and intermediate, with some rainfall and variable temperature. Summer typically brings night and morning low clouds or fog, followed by sunny, warm days. The warmest and driest months are typically June through September, with the highest temperatures occurring in September. Mid-summer (July\u2013August) is often a bit cooler due to the sea breezes and fog common then.\n\nIn a year, there are an average of 2.9 days with highs of {{convert|90.0|\u00b0F}} or higher, and an average of 0.8 days with lows of {{convert|32|\u00b0F}} or lower. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|107|\u00b0F}} on June 15, 2000 and July 16, 1993, and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|24|\u00b0F}} on December 22, 1990.\n\nJanuary is normally the wettest month, averaging {{convert|5.13|in|mm}} of precipitation. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|25.40|in|mm}}, falling on an average of 63.7 days each year. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|14.49|in|mm}} in February 1998. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|6.98|in|mm}} on January 4, 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/040693.pdf|format=PDF|title=Climatography of the United States : No. 20 : 1971-2000|publisher=Cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov|accessdate=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725104836/http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/040693.pdf|archive-date=July 25, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As in most of California, the heaviest rainfall years are usually associated with warm water [[El Ni\u00f1o]] episodes in the Pacific (e.g., 1982\u201383; 1997\u201398), which bring in drenching \"[[pineapple express]]\" storms. In contrast, dry years are often associated with cold Pacific [[La Ni\u00f1a]] episodes. Light snow has fallen on rare occasions. Snow has generally fallen every several years on the higher peaks of the [[Berkeley Hills]].<ref>Western Regional Climate Center Web site</ref>\n\nIn the late spring and early fall, strong [[Diablo wind|offshore winds]] of sinking air typically develop, bringing heat and dryness to the area. In the spring, this is not usually a problem as vegetation is still moist from winter rains, but extreme dryness prevails by the fall, creating a danger of wildfires. In September 1923 a major fire swept through the neighborhoods north of the university campus, stopping just short of downtown. (''See'' [[1923 Berkeley fire]]). On October 20, 1991, gusty, hot winds fanned a conflagration along the Berkeley\u2013Oakland border, killing 25 people and injuring 150, as well as destroying 2,449 single-family dwellings and 437 apartment and condominium units.

An example of these efforts, to create and maintain space for those who cannot fight for themselves, lies in the movement to preserve People's Park as a place for the homeless population to call its own, instead of destroying it to make room for more student housing in the area.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Don|date=|title=The End of Public Space?People's Park, Definitions of the Public, and Democracy|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01797.xa#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xMTExL2ouMTQ2Ny04MzA2LjE5OTUudGIwMTc5Ny54YT9uZWVkQWNjZXNzPXRydWVAQEAw|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The efforts made by the community to create and maintain space for the homeless population in Berkeley did not stop there. With the history of homelessness and lack of affordable housing, there has been masses of organizations opening up with the sole mission to help this vulnerable population with not only housing assistance, but other symptoms that derive from homelessness. These organizations have stemmed from church groups, non-profits, even the UC. One of the many UC Berkeley student run programs that focuses on assisting the homeless is the [[Suitcase Clinic]]. The Suitcase Clinic was established in the late 1980s by undergraduate and graduate level students to provide direct medical services to the homeless and underrepresented population of Berkeley.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinbach|first=Alan|date=|title=The Berkeley Suitcase Clinic: Homeless Services by Undergraduate and Medical Student Team|url=http://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Citation/2001/05000/The_Berkeley_Suitcase_Clinic__Homeless_Services_by.58.aspx|journal=Academic Medicine|volume=76|pages=524|via=|doi=10.1097/00001888-200105000-00058}}</ref> Services provided by students have altered over the years to cater to the needs of the homeless population, and now include not only professional medical and dental support, but also health education, foot-washing, child care, a hot meal, and services that promote mental well-being.<ref>http://www.suitcaseclinic.org</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\nBerkeley is served by [[Amtrak]] ([[Capitol Corridor]]), [[AC Transit]], [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] ([[Ashby (BART station)|Ashby]], [[Downtown Berkeley Station]] and [[North Berkeley (BART)|North Berkeley]]) and bus shuttles operated by major employers including [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] and [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. The [[Eastshore Freeway]] ([[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] and [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]]) runs along the bay shoreline. Each day there is an influx of thousands of cars into the city by commuting UC faculty, staff and students, making parking for more than a few hours an expensive proposition.\n\nBerkeley has one of the highest rates of bicycle and pedestrian commuting in the nation. Berkeley is the safest city of its size in California for pedestrians and cyclists, considering the number of injuries per pedestrian and cyclist, rather than per capita.<ref>[http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/contentdisplay.aspx?id=8512 Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety in Berkeley], City of Berkeley.</ref>\n\n[[File:IMAG4107-berkeley-etna-and-dwight.jpg|thumb|A street closed off into two dead ends by traffic calming barriers.  A gap in the middle allows passage by bikes and emergency vehicles.]]\nBerkeley has modified its original grid roadway structure through use of diverters and barriers, moving most traffic out of neighborhoods and onto arterial streets (visitors often find this confusing, because the diverters are not shown on all maps). Berkeley maintains a separate grid of arterial streets for bicycles, called [[Bicycle Boulevards]], with bike lanes and lower amounts of car traffic than the major streets they often parallel.\n\nBerkeley hosts [[car sharing]] networks including [[Uhaul Car Share]], and [[Zipcar]]. Rather than owning (and parking) their own cars, members share a group of cars parked nearby. Web- and telephone-based reservation systems keep track of hours and charges. Several \"pods\" (points of departure where cars are kept) exist throughout the city, in several downtown locations, at the Ashby and North Berkeley BART stations, and at various other locations in Berkeley (and other cities in the region). Using alternative transportation is encouraged.\n\nBerkeley has had recurring problems with [[parking meter]] vandalism. In 1999, over 2,400 Berkeley meters were jammed, smashed, or sawed apart.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/01/25/BAG664HDH31.DTL \"Chicanery tops meters in Berkeley\"], ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref> Starting in 2005 and continuing into 2006, Berkeley began to phase out mechanical meters in favor of more centralized electronic meters.\n\n===Transportation history===\nThe first commuter service to San Francisco was provided by the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]]'s [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], a [[standard gauge]] [[steam railroad]], which terminated in downtown Berkeley, and connected in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] (at a locale then known as \"Shellmound\") with trains to the [[Oakland Long Wharf|Oakland ferry pier]] as well as with the Central Pacific main line starting in 1876. The Berkeley Branch line was extended from Shattuck and University to Vine Street (\"Berryman's Station\") in 1878. Starting in 1882, Berkeley trains ran directly to the Oakland Pier.<ref>''Berkeley Gazette'', January 22, 1903</ref> In the 1880s, [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] assumed operations of the Berkeley Branch under a lease from its own paper affiliate, the Northern Railway. In 1911, Southern Pacific electrified this line and the several others it constructed in Berkeley, creating its [[East Bay Electric Lines]] division. The huge and heavy cars specially built for these lines were called the \"Red Trains\" or the \"Big Red Cars.\" The Shattuck line was extended and connected with two other Berkeley lines (the Ninth Street Line and the California Street line) at Solano and Colusa (the \"Colusa [[Wye (rail)|Wye]]\"). At this time, the [[Northbrae Tunnel]] and Rose Street Undercrossing were constructed, both of which still exist. (The Rose Street Undercrossing is not accessible to the public, being situated between what is now two backyards.) The fourth Berkeley line was the Ellsworth St. line to the university campus. The last Red Trains ran in July 1941.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ford |first=Robert S. |title=Red Trains in the East Bay: The History of the Southern Pacific Transbay Train and Ferry System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PT8fAQAAIAAJ |year=1977 |series=Interurbans Specials |volume=65 |publisher=[[Interurban Press]] |location=Glendale, California |isbn=0-916374-27-0}}</ref>\n\nThe first electric rail service in Berkeley was provided by several small [[streetcar]] companies starting in 1891. Most of these were eventually bought up by the [[Key System]] of [[Francis \"Borax\" Smith]] who added lines and improved equipment. The Key System's streetcars were operated by its East Bay Street Railways division. Principal lines in Berkeley ran on Euclid, The Arlington, College, Telegraph, Shattuck, San Pablo, University, and Grove (today's Martin Luther King Jr. Way). The last streetcars ran in 1948, replaced by buses.\n\nThe first electric commuter interurban-type trains to San Francisco from Berkeley were put in operation by the Key System in 1903, several years before the Southern Pacific electrified its steam commuter lines. Like the SP, Key trains ran to a pier serviced by the Key's own fleet of [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|ferryboats]], which also docked at the Ferry Building in San Francisco. After the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] was built, the Key trains ran to the [[Transbay Terminal]] in San Francisco, sharing tracks on the lower deck of the Bay Bridge with the SP's red trains and the [[Sacramento Northern]] Railroad. It was at this time that the Key trains acquired their letter designations, which were later preserved by Key's public successor, AC Transit. Today's F bus is the successor of the F train. Likewise, the E, G and the H. Before the Bridge, these lines were simply the Shattuck Avenue Line, the Claremont Line, the Westbrae Line, and the Sacramento Street Line, respectively.\n\nAfter the Southern Pacific abandoned transbay service in 1941, the Key System acquired the rights to use its tracks and [[overhead lines|catenary]] on Shattuck north of Dwight Way and through the Northbrae Tunnel to The Alameda for the F-train. The SP tracks along Monterey Avenue as far as Colusa had been acquired by the Key System in 1933 for the H-train, but were abandoned in 1941. The Key System trains stopped running in April 1958.<ref>{{cite book |last=Demoro |first=Harre W. |title=The Key Route: Transbay Commuting by Train and Ferry, Part 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p0wfAQAAIAAJ |year=1985 |series=Interurbans Specials |volume=95 |publisher=[[Interurban Press]] |location=Glendale, California |isbn=0-916374-66-1}}</ref> On December 15, 1962, the Northbrae Tunnel was opened to auto traffic.<ref>[http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/Californiahighways/chpw_1963_marapr.pdf ''California Highways and Public Works'', March-April 1963, pp.61-64]</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Top employers===\n[[File:CampanileMtTamalpiasSunset-original.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sather Tower]] at the University of California]]\nAccording to the city's 2016 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/Finance/Home/Comprehensive_Annual_Financial_Report_%28CAFR%29.aspx |title=list of current and past City of Berkeley CAFR's |publisher=Ci.berkeley.ca.us |date= |accessdate=June 19, 2014}}</ref> the top employers in the city are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!

It has many nice restaurants and small shops. \n*Ashby Avenue ([[California State Route 13|Highway 13]]), which also runs from Berkeley's bayshore to the hills, connects with the Warren Freeway and [[California State Route 24|Highway 24]] leading to the [[Caldecott Tunnel]], named for a former Berkeley mayor.\n*[[San Pablo Avenue]] ([[California State Route 123|Highway 123]]) runs north\u2013south through West Berkeley, connecting [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] to the south and [[Albany, California|Albany]] to the north.\n*[[Telegraph Avenue]], which runs north-south from the university campus to Oakland, historically the site of much of the [[hippie]] culture of Berkeley.\n*Martin Luther King Jr. Way, which until 1984 was called Grove St, runs north-south a few blocks west of Shattuck Avenue, connecting Oakland and the freeways to the south with the neighborhoods and other communities to the north.\n*Sacramento Street is one of the four streets with a median in Berkeley, running from Hopkins Street from the north to Alcatraz Ave in the south.\n*[[Solano Avenue]], a major street for shopping and restaurants, runs east-west near the north end of Berkeley, continuing into Albany. Since 1974, Solano Avenue has hosted the annual Solano Avenue Stroll and Parade<ref>[http://www.solanoavenueassn.org/events/solano-avenue-stroll/ Solano Avenue Stroll and Parade]</ref> of the twin-cities of Albany and Berkeley, the East Bay's largest street festival.\n\n===Freeways===\n*The [[Eastshore Freeway]] ([[Interstate 80 in California|I-80]] and [[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]]) runs along Berkeley's bayshore with exits at Ashby Avenue, University Avenue and Gilman Street.\n\n===Bicycle and pedestrian paths===\n*[[Ohlone Greenway]]\n*[[San Francisco Bay Trail]]\n*[[Berkeley I-80 bridge]] \u2013 opened in 2002, an arch-suspension bridge spanning Interstate 80, for bicycles and pedestrians only, giving access from the city at the foot of Addison Street to the [[San Francisco Bay Trail]], the [[Eastshore State Park]] and the [[Berkeley Marina]].\n*Berkeley's Network of Historic Pathways \u2013 Berkeley has a network of historic pathways that link the winding neighborhoods found in the hills and offer panoramic lookouts over the East Bay. A complete guide to the pathways may be found at [[Berkeley Path Wanderers Association]] website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://berkeleypaths.org|title=Berkeley Path Wanderers Association|publisher=Berkeleypaths.org|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{See also|List of Berkeley neighborhoods}}\n[[File:Claremonthotel03192006.JPG|thumb|The Claremont Resort at the heart of the Claremont neighborhood]]\n\nBerkeley has a number of distinct neighborhoods.\nSurrounding the [[University of California, Berkeley Campus Architecture|University of California campus]] are the most densely populated parts of the city. West of the campus is [[Downtown Berkeley, California|Downtown Berkeley]], the city's traditional commercial core; home of the [[civic center]], the city's only public [[Berkeley High School (California)|high school]], the busiest [[Downtown Berkeley Station|BART station]] in Berkeley, as well as a major transfer point for [[AC Transit]] buses. South of the campus is the [[Southside, Berkeley, California|Southside]] neighborhood, mainly a [[student ghetto]], where much of the university's [[UC Berkeley student housing|student housing]] is located. The busiest stretch of [[Telegraph Avenue]] is in this neighborhood. North of the campus is the quieter [[Northside, Berkeley, California|Northside]] neighborhood, the location of the [[Graduate Theological Union]].\n\nFarther from the university campus, the influence of the university quickly becomes less visible. Most of Berkeley's neighborhoods are primarily made up of detached houses, often with separate in-law units in the rear, although larger apartment buildings are also common in many neighborhoods. Commercial activities are concentrated along the major avenues and at important intersections.\n\nIn the southeastern corner of the city is the [[Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Claremont District]], home to the [[Claremont Resort|Claremont Hotel]]; and the [[Elmwood, Berkeley, California|Elmwood District]], with a small shopping area on College Avenue. West of Elmwood is [[South Berkeley, Berkeley, California|South Berkeley]], known for its weekend [[flea market]] at the [[Ashby (BART station)|Ashby Station]].\n\nWest of (and including) San Pablo Avenue, a major commercial corridor, is [[West Berkeley, Berkeley, California|West Berkeley]], the historic commercial center of the city, and the former unincorporated town of [[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]]. West Berkeley contains the remnants of Berkeley's industrial area, much of which has been replaced by retail and office uses, as well as residential live/work loft space, with the decline of manufacturing in the United States. The areas of South and West Berkeley are in the midst of redevelopment. Some residents have opposed redevelopment in this area. Along the shoreline of San Francisco Bay at the foot of University Avenue is the [[Berkeley Marina]].

It is much more likely that the name derives from the 'Bold Adventure' tin-working area which was in operation near Jamaica Inn during the 1840s-1850s <ref>R. D. Penhallurick ''Tin in Antiquity'' (2008) Maney; p. 207</ref>\n\n==Jamaica Inn==\nBolventor is the location of the famous [[Jamaica Inn]] [[coaching inn]]. It is bypassed by a [[dual carriageway]] section of the [[A30 road|A30]] trunk road; before the bypass was built the hamlet straddled the A30 road.\n\n[[Daphne du Maurier]], a former resident, chose Bolventor as the setting for her novel about Cornish [[smuggling|smugglers]] titled ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]''.  The inn that inspired the novel, Jamaica Inn, has stood beside the main road through the village since 1547. It is now a tourist attraction in its own right and dominates the hamlet.\n\n==Church==\n[[File:Holy Trinity Church, Bolventor - geograph.org.uk - 794080.jpg|thumb|Holy Trinity Church, Bolventor]]\nThe small [[Church (building)|church]] (dedicated to the Holy Trinity) that lies to the east of the hamlet closed some years ago. A mile from Bolventor there was a chapel of St Luke (from the 13th to the early 16th century): the font is now at the church of [[Tideford]].<ref>''Cornish Church Guide'' (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 62</ref> Bolventor parish was established in 1846 (before that date the village was in St Neot parish) but has now been merged with [[Altarnun]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Cornwall|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Hamlets in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Bodmin Moor]]", "sha1": "khz5x50vqgss9lciskp1j6xsv2i1j9y"}}, {"title": "Bengal", "ns": "0", "id": "4862", "revision": {"id": "866750133", "parentid": "866748802", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T09:29:51Z", "contributor": {"ip": "108.68.82.2"}, "comment": "/* Demographics */ minor clarif", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses}}\n{{EngvarB|date=April 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2016}}\n{{Infobox region\n| name = Bengal\n| native_name = <small> {{unbulleted list |{{nobold|{{lang|bn|'''\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be / \u09ac\u0999\u09cd\u0997'''}}}}\n| {{small|''{{transl|bn|B\u0101ngl\u0101 / B\u00f4ng\u00f4}}''}}}}</small>\n| type = Region in [[Asia]]\n| image_skyline =Map_of_Bengal.svg\n| imagesize = 280px\n| image_caption = Location of Bengal\n| subdivision_type = Continent\n| subdivision_name = [[Asia]]\n| subdivision_type1 = Countries\n| subdivision_name1 = {{ubl| {{flag|Bangladesh}}   | {{flag|India}} ([[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]]'s [[Barak Valley]])}}\n| parts_type = Principal Cities\n| parts_style = list\n| p1 ={{flagicon|Bangladesh}} [[Dhaka]]\n| p2 ={{flagicon|India}} [[Kolkata]]\n| p3 = {{flagicon|Bangladesh}} [[Chittagong]]\n| area_total_km2 = 236322\n| population_as_of = 2011\n| population_total = 250 million ~ 300&nbsp;million\n| population_density_km2 = 1070\n| population_demonym = [[Bengalis|Bengali]]\n| blank1_name  = {{nowrap|Official languages}}\n| blank1_info  = '''[[Bangladesh]]''' \u2013 [[Bengali language|Bengali]]<ref name=\"bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd\">{{cite book |title=The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh |chapter=Article 3.

Politically both Bangladesh and Indian Bengal are socialist, with left wing parties dominating the region's politics.\n\n=== Bangladeshi Republic ===\n{{Main|Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Bangabhaban.jpg|thumb|[[Bangabhaban]] (the ''House of Bengal'') is the official residence of the [[president of Bangladesh]]]]\nThe state of Bangladesh is a [[parliamentary republic]] based on the [[Westminster system]], with a [[Constitution of Bangladesh|written constitution]] and a [[President of Bangladesh|President]] elected by parliament for mostly ceremonial purposes. The [[Government of Bangladesh|government]] is headed by a [[Prime Minister]], who is appointed by the President from among the popularly elected 300 [[Members of Parliament]] in the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]], the national parliament. The Prime Minister is traditionally the leader of the single largest party in the Jatiyo Sangshad. Under the constitution, [[Islam]] is recognized as the [[state religion]]; while Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and people of all other denomiations are stated to enjoy equal rights.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1990, Bangladesh had a [[presidential system]] of government. Since the 1990s, it was administered by non-political technocratic [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker governments]] on four occasions, the last being under military-backed emergency rule in 2007 and 2008. The [[Awami League]] and the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) are the two largest political parties in Bangladesh.\n\nBangladesh is a prominent member of the [[United Nations]], being the largest contributor of [[peacekeeping]] forces in the world and a key promoter of [[multilateral diplomacy]]. It is also a member of [[SAARC]], the [[Developing 8 Countries]], [[BIMSTEC]], the [[World Trade Organization]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], the [[OIC]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. A [[developing country]] with high levels of poverty, Bangladesh has achieved significant strides in [[human development (humanity)|human development]] compared to its neighbors.\n\n=== Indian Bengal ===\n{{Main|West Bengal|Tripura|Assam|Seven Sister States}}\n[[File:Garden with Writers Building at Rear - Central Kolkata.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Writers' Building]], the former official seat of the [[Government of West Bengal]]]]\n[[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] (home to the [[Barak Valley]]) are provincial states of the [[India|Republic of India]], with local [[State governments of India|executives]] and [[Vidhan Sabha|assemblies]]- features shared with other states in the Indian federal system. The [[president of India]] appoints a [[governor]] as the ceremonial representative of the [[Government of India|union government]]. The governor appoints the [[chief minister]] on the nomination of the [[legislative assembly]]. The chief minister is the traditionally the leader of the party or coalition with most seats in the assembly. [[President's rule]] is often imposed in Indian states as a direct intervention of the union government led by the [[prime minister of India]].\n\nEach state has popularly elected members in the Indian lower house of parliament, the [[Lok Sabha]]. Each state nominates members to the Indian upper house of parliament, the [[Rajya Sabha]].\n\nThe state legislative assemblies also play a key role in electing the ceremonial president of India. The former president of India, [[Pranab Mukherjee]], was a native of West Bengal and a leader of the [[Indian National Congress]].\n\nThe two major political forces in the Bengali-speaking zone of India are the [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] and the [[Trinamool Congress]], with the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Indian National Congress]] being minor players.\n\n=== Crossborder relations ===\n{{Main|Bangladesh-India relations}}\n\nIndia and Bangladesh are the world's second and eighth most populous countries respectively. [[Bangladesh-India relations]] began on a high note in 1971 when India played a major role in the [[liberation of Bangladesh]], with the Indian Bengali populace and media providing overwhelming support to the independence movement in the former East Pakistan. The two countries had a twenty five-year friendship treaty between 1972 and 1996. However, differences over river sharing, border security and access to trade have long plagued the relationship. In more recent years, a consensus has evolved in both countries on the importance of developing good relations, as well as a strategic partnership in South Asia and beyond. Commercial, cultural and defense cooperation have expanded since 2010, when Prime Ministers [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Manmohan Singh]] pledged to reinvigorate ties.\n\nThe Bangladesh High Commission in [[New Delhi]] operates a Deputy High Commission in [[Kolkata]] and a consular office in [[Agartala]]. India has a High Commission in [[Dhaka]] with consulates in [[Chittagong]] and [[Rajshahi]]. Frequent international air, bus and rail services connect major cities in Bangladesh and Indian Bengal, particularly the three largest cities- Dhaka, Kolkata and Chittagong. Undocumented immigration of Bangladeshi workers is a controversial issue championed by right-wing nationalist parties in India but finds little sympathy in West Bengal.<ref name=natwarspeech>{{cite web |url=http://www.mea.gov.in/incoming-visit-detail.htm |title=Address by External Affairs Minister Shri Natwar Singh at India-Bangladesh Dialogue Organised by Centre for Policy Dialogue and India International Centre |date=7 August 2005 |website=Speeches |publisher=Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi |accessdate=28 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505224301/http://www.mea.gov.in/incoming-visit-detail.htm?2663 |archive-date=5 May 2016 |dead-url=no}}</ref> India has since fenced the border which has been criticized by Bangladesh.<ref name=migrHindu>{{cite magazine |last=Chattopadhyay |first=S.S. |date=June 2007 |title=Constant traffic |magazine=Frontline |volume=24 |issue=11 |publisher=The Hindu |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2411/stories/20070615003701400.htm |accessdate=26 February 2008 |ref=harv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417025216/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2411/stories/20070615003701400.htm |archive-date=17 April 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Bangladesh|Demographics of West Bengal|Languages of Bangladesh}}\n{{Multiple image\n | perrow = 2\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | width = 180\n | image1 = BD Map admin.svg\n | caption1 = [[Districts of Bangladesh]]\n | image2 = WestBengalDistrictscurrent.png\n | caption2 = [[Districts of West Bengal]]\n | image3 = Eid Prayers in Rajarbagh, Dhaka on 6 October 2014.jpg\n | caption3 = [[Bengali Muslims]] taking part in mass prayer of [[Eid al-Fitr]]\n | image4 = Bakul Bagan Sarbojanin Arnab Dutta 2011.jpg\n | caption4 = [[Bengali Hindu]] priests performing [[Durga Puja]] rituals\n | image5 = Ful Biju-Chengi river-Khagrachori-Biplob Rahman.jpg\n | caption5 = [[Buddhist]] [[Chakma people]] enjoying one of their festivals in south-eastern [[Bangladesh]]\n}}\nThe Bengal region is one of the [[Population density|most densely populated areas]] in the world.

The [[Bangladesh taka]] is an official standard bearer of this tradition, while the [[Indian rupee]] is also written as taka in Bengali script on all of its banknotes. The [[history of the taka]] dates back centuries. Bengal was home one of the world's earliest coin currencies in the first millennium BCE. Under the Delhi Sultanate, the taka was introduced by [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] in 1329. Bengal became the stronghold of the taka. The silver currency was the most important symbol of sovereignty of the [[Sultanate of Bengal]]. It was traded on the [[Silk Road]] and replicated in [[Nepal]] and China's [[Tibet]]an protectorate. The [[Pakistani rupee]] was scripted in Bengali as taka on its banknotes until Bangladesh's creation in 1971.\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Bengali literature}}\n{{Main|Bengali literature|Indian English literature|Bangladeshi English literature}}\n[[File:Tagore Iran.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rabindranath Tagore]], known as the Bengali Shakespeare, being hosted at the Parliament of [[Iran]] in the 1930s]]\nBengali literature has a rich heritage.

The [[Bengali language]] and [[Bengali script|script]] evolved circa 1000&nbsp;CE from [[Magadhi Prakrit]].

Bengali literature in the medieval age was often either religious (e.g. [[Chandidas]]), or adaptations from other languages (e.g. [[Alaol]]). During the [[Bengal Renaissance]] of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[Bengali literature]] was modernised through the works of authors such as [[Michael Madhusudan Dutta]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], [[Satyendranath Dutta]] and [[Jibanananda Das]].

To sum to zero, the force of the water must point oppositely to the sum of the centrifugal and gravity forces, which means the surface of the water must adjust so its normal points in this direction. (A very similar problem is the design of a [[Centripetal force#Example: The banked turn|banked turn]], where the slope of the turn is set so a car will not slide off the road. The analogy in the case of rotating bucket is that the element of water surface will \"slide\" up or down the surface unless the normal to the surface aligns with the vector resultant formed by the [[vector addition]] '''F'''<sub>g</sub> + '''F'''<sub>Cfgl</sub>.)\n\nAs ''r'' increases, the centrifugal force increases according to the relation (the equations are written per unit mass):\n:<math>F_{\\mathrm{Cfgl}} =  m \\mathit{\\Omega}^2 r \\ , </math>\nwhere ''\u03a9'' is the constant rate of rotation of the water. The gravitational force is unchanged at\n:<math>F_{\\mathrm{g}} = mg \\ , </math>\nwhere ''g'' is the [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration due to gravity]]. These two forces add to make a resultant at an angle ''\u03c6'' from the vertical given by\n:<math>\\tan \\varphi =\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{Cfgl}}}{F_{\\mathrm{g}}} = \\frac { \\mathit{\\Omega}^2 r }{g} \\ ,</math>\nwhich clearly becomes larger as ''r'' increases. To ensure that this resultant is normal to the surface of the water, and therefore can be effectively nulled by the force of the water beneath, the normal to the surface must have the same angle, that is,\n:<math>\\tan \\varphi = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}h}{\\mathrm{d}r} \\ , </math>\nleading to the ordinary differential equation for the shape of the surface:\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}h}{\\mathrm{d}r}  =  \\frac { \\mathit{\\Omega}^2 r }{g} \\ ,</math>\nor, integrating:\n:<math> h(r) =h(0) + \\frac{1}{2g} \\left( \\mathit{\\Omega} r \\right)^2 \\ ,</math>\nwhere ''h''(0) is the height of the water at ''r'' = 0. In words, the surface of the water is parabolic in its dependence upon the radius.\n\n===Potential energy===\nThe shape of the water's surface can be found in a different, very intuitive way using the interesting idea of the [[potential energy]] associated with the centrifugal force in the co-rotating frame.\nIn a reference frame uniformly rotating at angular rate \u03a9, the fictitious centrifugal force is [[conservative force|conservative]] and has a potential energy of the form:<ref name=Carmichael>{{cite book |page=78 |author= Robert Daniel Carmichael |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LKAgAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fictitious+Christoffel+potential#PPA78,M1 |title=The Theory of Relativity |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=1920   }}</ref><ref name= Weber>{{cite book |title=Essential mathematical methods for physicists |author=Hans J.

Notice that at [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] the surface adopts a shape such that an element of volume at any location on its surface has the same potential energy as at any other. That being so, no element of water on the surface has any incentive to move position, because all positions are equivalent in energy. That is, equilibrium is attained. On the other hand, were surface regions with lower energy available, the water occupying surface locations of higher potential energy would move to occupy these positions of lower energy, inasmuch as there is no barrier to lateral movement in an ideal liquid.\n\nWe might imagine deliberately upsetting this equilibrium situation by somehow momentarily altering the surface shape of the water to make it different from an equal-energy surface. This change in shape would not be stable, and the water would not stay in our artificially contrived shape, but engage in a transient exploration of many shapes until non-ideal frictional forces introduced by sloshing, either against the sides of the bucket or by the non-ideal nature of the liquid, killed the oscillations and the water settled down to the equilibrium shape.\n\nTo see the principle of an equal-energy surface at work, imagine gradually increasing the rate of rotation of the bucket from zero. The water surface is flat at first, and clearly a surface of equal potential energy because all points on the surface are at the same height in the gravitational field acting upon the water. At some small angular rate of rotation, however, an element of surface water can achieve lower potential energy by moving outward under the influence of the centrifugal force. Because water is incompressible and must remain within the confines of the bucket, this outward movement increases the depth of water at the larger radius, increasing the height of the surface at larger radius, and lowering it at smaller radius. The surface of the water becomes slightly concave, with the consequence that the potential energy of the water at the greater radius is increased by the work done against gravity to achieve the greater height. As the height of water increases, movement toward the periphery becomes no longer advantageous, because the reduction in potential energy from working with the centrifugal force is balanced against the increase in energy working against gravity. Thus, at a given angular rate of rotation, a concave surface represents the stable situation, and the more rapid the rotation, the more concave this surface. If rotation is arrested, the energy stored in fashioning the concave surface must be dissipated, for example through friction, before an equilibrium flat surface is restored.\n\nTo implement a surface of constant potential energy quantitatively, let the height of the water be  <math>h(r)\\,</math>: then the potential energy per unit mass contributed by gravity is <math>g h(r) \\ </math>  and the total potential energy per unit mass on the surface is\n:<math>{U} = {U}_0 + gh(r) - \\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2 r^2\\,</math>\n\nwith <math>{U}_0</math> the background energy level independent of ''r''. In a static situation (no motion of the fluid in the rotating frame), this energy is constant independent of position ''r''.  Requiring the energy to be constant, we obtain the [[Parabola|parabolic]] form:\n\n:<math>h(r) =  \\frac{\\Omega^2}{2g}r^2 + h(0) \\ , </math>\n\nwhere ''h(0)'' is the height at ''r'' = 0 (the axis). See Figures 1 and 2.\n\nThe principle of operation of the [[centrifuge]] also can be simply understood in terms of this expression for the potential energy, which shows that it is favorable energetically when the volume far from the axis of rotation is occupied by the heavier substance.\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-2}}\n*[[Centrifugal force]]\n*[[Rotational gravity]]\n*[[Inertial frame of reference]]\n*[[Mach's principle]]\n*[[Mechanics of planar particle motion]]\n{{Col-2-of-2}}\n*[[Philosophy of space and time#Absolutism and relationalism|Philosophy of space and time: Absolutism vs. relationalism]]\n*[[Rotating reference frame]]\n*[[Rotating spheres]]\n*[[Sagnac effect]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Brian Greene |title=[[The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality]] |chapter= Chapter 2, The Universe and the Bucket |isbn=0-375-41288-3 |publisher=A A Knopf |year=2004}}\n* The isotropy of the [[cosmic background radiation]] is another indicator that the universe does not rotate.

The word [[breviary]], in general, refers to a collection of Christian orders of prayers and readings, such as contained in [[Anglican]] or [[Lutheran]] resources. It may also be used to refer to an abridged version of any text or a brief account or summary of some subject, but is primarily used to refer to a Christian liturgical book. The volume containing the daily hours of Catholic prayer was published as the ''Breviarium Romanum'' (Roman Breviary) until the reforms of Paul VI, when it became known as the [[Liturgy of the Hours]]. However, these terms are used interchangeably to refer to the Office in all its forms. This entry deals with the Roman Breviary prior to the changes introduced by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1974.\n\n==Origin of name==\nThis word breviary (Lat. Breviarium), signifies in its primary acceptation an abridgment, or a compendium. It is often employed in this sense by Christian authors, e.g. Breviarium fidei, Breviarium in psalmos, Breviarium canonum, Breviarium regularum. In liturgical language Breviary has a special meaning, indicating a book furnishing the regulations for the celebration of Mass or the canonical Office, and may be met with under the titles Breviarium Ecclesiastici Ordinis, or Breviarium Ecclesi\u00e6 Romins\u00e6 (Roman\u00e6). In the ninth century Alcuin uses the word to designate an office abridged or simplified for the use of the laity. [[Prudentius of Troyes]], about the same period, composed a Breviarium Psalterii (v. inf. V. HISTORY). In an ancient inventory occurs Breviarium Antiphonarii, meaning \"Extracts from the Antiphonary\". In the \"Vita Aldrici\" occurs \"sicut in plenariis et breviariis Ecclesi\u00e6 ejusdem continentur\". Again, in the inventories in the catalogues, such notes as these may be met with: \"Sunt et duo cursinarii et tres benedictionales Libri; ex his unus habet obsequium mortuorum et unus Breviarius\", or, \"Pr\u00e6ter Breviarium quoddam quod usque ad festivitatem S. Joannis Baptist\u00e6 retinebunt\", etc. Monte Cassino about A.D. 1100 obtained a book titled \"Incipit Breviarium sive Ordo Officiorum per totam anni decursionem\".\n\nFrom such references, and from others of a like nature, Quesnel gathers that by the word Breviarium was at first designated a book furnishing the rubrics, a sort of [[Directorium|Ordo]]. The title Breviary, as we employ it\u2014that is, a book containing the entire canonical office\u2014appears to date from the eleventh century.\n\n[[Pope Gregory VII|St. Gregory VII]] having, indeed, abridged the order of prayers, and having simplified the Liturgy as performed at the Roman Court, this abridgment received the name of Breviary, which was suitable, since, according to the etymology of the word, it was an abridgment. The name has been extended to books which contain in one volume, or at least in one work, liturgical books of different kinds, such as the Psalter, the Antiphonary, the Responsoriary, the Lectionary, etc. In this connection it may be pointed out that in this sense the word, as it is used nowadays, is illogical; it should be named a Plenarium rather than a Breviarium, since, liturgically speaking, the word Plenarium exactly designates such books as contain several different compilations united under one cover. This is pointed out, however, simply to make still clearer the meaning and origin of the word; and section V will furnish a more detailed explanation of the formation of the Breviary.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stuartbreviary.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart's]] personal breviary, which she took with her to the scaffold, is preserved in the [[National Library of Russia]] of [[St. Petersburg]]]]\n\n===Early history===\nThe canonical hours of the Breviary owe their remote origin to the [[Old Covenant]] when God commanded the Aaronic priests to offer morning and evening sacrifices. Other inspiration may have come from David's words in the Psalms \"Seven times a day I praise you\" (Ps. 119:164), as well as, \"the just man meditates on the law day and night\" (Ps. 1:2). Regarding Daniel \"Three times daily he was kneeling and offering prayers and thanks to his God\" (Dan. 6:10).\n\nIn the early days of Christian worship the [[Bible|Sacred Scriptures]] furnished all that was thought necessary, containing as it did the books from which the lessons were read and the psalms that were recited. The first step in the evolution of the Breviary was the separation of the Psalter into a choir-book. At first the president of the local church (bishop) or the leader of the choir chose a particular psalm as he thought appropriate. From about the 4th century certain psalms began to be grouped together, a process that was furthered by the monastic practice of daily reciting the 150 psalms. This took so much time that the monks began to spread it over a week, dividing each day into hours, and allotting to each hour its portion of the Psalter. St Benedict in the 6th century drew up such an arrangement, probably, though not certainly, on the basis of an older Roman division which, though not so skilful, is the one in general use. Gradually there were added to these psalter choir-books additions in the form of antiphons, responses, collects or short prayers, for the use of those not skilful at improvisation and metrical compositions. [[Jean Beleth]], a 12th-century liturgical author, gives the following list of books necessary for the right conduct of the canonical office: the Antiphonarium, the Old and New Testaments, the ''Passionarius (liber)'' and the ''Legendarius'' (dealing respectively with martyrs and saints), the ''Homiliarius'' (homilies on the Gospels), the ''Sermologus'' (collection of sermons) and the works of the Fathers, besides, of course, the ''Psalterium'' and the ''Collectarium''. To overcome the inconvenience of using such a library the Breviary came into existence and use. Already in the 9th century [[Prudentius, bishop of Troyes]], had in a ''Breviarium Psalterii'' made an abridgment of the Psalter for the laity, giving a few psalms for each day, and Alcuin had rendered a similar service by including a prayer for each day and some other prayers, but no lessons or homilies. The Breviary rightly so called, however, only dates from the 11th century; the earliest MS. containing the whole canonical office is of the year 1099 and is in the Mazarin library. Gregory VII (pope 1073\u20131085), too, simplified the liturgy as performed at the Roman court, and gave his abridgment the name of Breviary, which thus came to denote a work which from another point of view might be called a Plenary, involving as it did the collection of several works into one. There are several extant specimens of 12th-century Breviaries, all Benedictine, but under Innocent III (pope 1198\u20131216) their use was extended, especially by the newly founded and active Franciscan order. These preaching friars, with the authorization of Gregory IX, adopted (with some modifications, e.g. the substitution of the \"Gallican\" for the \"Roman\" version of the Psalter) the Breviary hitherto used exclusively by the Roman court, and with it gradually swept out of Europe all the earlier partial books (Legendaries, Responsories), &c., and to some extent the local Breviaries, like that of Sarum. Finally, [[Pope Nicholas III|Nicholas III]] (pope 1277\u20131280) adopted this version both for the curia and for the basilicas of Rome, and thus made its position secure.\n\n===Local and regular breviaries===\nThe Benedictines and Dominicans have Breviaries of their own. The only other types that merit notice are:\n# the Mozarabic Breviary, once in use throughout all Spain, but now confined to a single foundation at Toledo; it is remarkable for the number and length of its hymns, and for the fact that the majority of its [[collects]] are addressed to God the Son;\n# the Ambrosian, now confined to Milan, where it owes its retention to the attachment of the clergy and people to their traditionary rites, which they derive from St Ambrose.\n\n===Early modern reforms===\nUntil the council of Trent every bishop had full power to regulate the Breviary of his own diocese; and this was acted upon almost everywhere. Each monastic community, also, had one of its own. Pius V (pope 1566\u20131572), however, while sanctioning those which could show at least 200 years of existence, made the Roman obligatory in all other places. But the influence of the [[Roman rite]] has gradually gone much beyond this, and has superseded almost all the local uses. The Roman has thus become nearly universal, with the allowance only of additional offices for saints specially venerated in each particular diocese. The Roman Breviary has undergone several revisions: The most remarkable of these is that by [[Francisco de Qui\u00f1ones|Francis Quignonez]], cardinal of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (1536), which, though not accepted by Rome (it was approved by Clement VII and Paul III, and permitted as a substitute for the unrevised Breviary, until Pius V in 1568 excluded it as too short and too modern, and issued a reformed edition (''Breviarium Pianum'', Pian Breviary) of the old Breviary), formed the model for the still more thorough reform made in 1549 by the [[Church of England]], whose daily morning and evening services are but a condensation and simplification of the Breviary offices. Some parts of the prefaces at the beginning of the English Prayer-Book are free translations of those of Quignonez. The Pian Breviary was again altered by [[Sixtus V]] in 1588, who introduced the revised [[Vulgate]], in 1602 by Clement VIII (through [[Baronius]] and Bellarmine), especially as concerns the rubrics; and by Urban VIII (1623\u20131644), a purist who altered the text of certain hymns.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries a movement of revision took place in France, and succeeded in modifying about half the Breviaries of that country. Historically, this proceeded from the labours of [[Jean de Launoy]] (1603\u20131678), \"le d\u00e9nicheur des saints\", and [[Louis S\u00e9bastien le Nain de Tillemont]], who had shown the falsity of numerous lives of the saints; while theologically it was produced by the Port Royal school, which led men to dwell more on communion with God as contrasted with the invocation of the saints. This was mainly carried out by the adoption of a rule that all antiphons and responses should be in the exact words of Scripture, which, of course, cut out the whole class of appeals to created beings. The services were at the same time simplified and shortened, and the use of the whole Psalter every week (which had become a mere theory in the Roman Breviary, owing to its frequent supersession by saints' day services) was made a reality. These reformed French Breviaries\u2014e.g. the Paris Breviary of 1680 by Archbishop [[Fran\u00e7ois de Harlay]] (1625\u20131695) and that of 1736 by Archbishop [[Charles-Gaspard-Guillaume de Vintimille du Luc]] (1655\u20131746)\u2014show a deep knowledge of Holy Scripture, and much careful adaptation of different texts.\n\n===Later modern reforms===\nDuring the pontificate of [[Pius IX]] a strong Ultramontane movement arose against the French Breviaries of 1680 and 1736. This was inaugurated by [[Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert|Montalembert]], but its literary advocates were chiefly [[Prosper Gu\u00e9ranger|Dom Gueranger]], a learned Benedictine monk, abbot of [[Solesmes, Sarthe|Solesmes]], and [[Louis Veuillot]] (1813\u20131883) of the Univers; and it succeeded in suppressing them everywhere, the last diocese to surrender being Orleans in 1875. The Jansenist and Gallican influence was also strongly felt in Italy and in Germany, where Breviaries based on the French models were published at Cologne, M\u00fcnster, Mainz and other towns. Meanwhile, under the direction of Benedict XIV (pope 1740\u20131758), a special congregation collected much material for an official revision, but nothing was published. In 1902, under Leo XIII, a commission under the presidency of Monsignor [[Louis Duchesne]] was appointed to consider the Breviary, the Missal, the Pontifical and the Ritual.\n\nSignificant changes came in 1910 with the [[reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X]]. This revision modified the traditional psalm scheme so that, while all 150 psalms were used in the course of the week, these were said without repetition. Those assigned to the Sunday office underwent the least revision, although noticeably fewer psalms are recited at Matins, and both Lauds and Compline are slightly shorter due to psalms (or in the case of Compline the first few verses of a psalm) being removed. Pius X was probably influenced by earlier attempts to eliminate repetition in the psalter, most notably the liturgy of the Benedictine congregation of St. Maur. However, since Cardinal Quignonez's attempt to reform the Breviary employed this principle\u2014albeit with no regard to the traditional scheme\u2014such notions had floated around in the western Church, and can particularly be seen in the Paris Breviary.\n\n[[Pope Pius XII]] introduced optional use of a new translation of the Psalms from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] to a more classical [[Latin]]. Most breviaries published in the late 1950s and early 1960s used this \"Pian Psalter\".\n\n[[Pope John XXIII]] also revised the Breviary in 1960, introducing changes drawn up by his predecessor Pope Pius XII. The most notable alteration is the shortening of most feasts from nine to three lessons at Matins, keeping only the Scripture readings (the former lesson i, then lessons ii and iii together), followed by either the first part of the patristic reading (lesson vii) or, for most feasts, a condensed version of the former second Nocturn, which was formerly used when a feast was reduced in rank and commemorated.\n\n===Manuscripts and printed editions===\nBefore the rise of the [[Mendicant Orders|mendicant orders]] (wandering [[friar]]s) in the thirteenth century, the daily services were usually contained in a number of large volumes. The first occurrence of a single manuscript of the [[Canonical hours|daily office]] was written by the [[Benedictine]] order at [[Monte Cassino]] in [[Italy]] in 1099. By a strange twist, the [[Benedictine]]s were not a [[Mendicant Orders|mendicant order]], but a stable, [[monastery]]-based order, and single-volume [[breviaries]] are rare from this early period.\n\nThe arrangement of the [[Psalms]] in the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] had a profound impact upon the breviaries used by secular and monastic clergy alike, until 1911 when Pope St. [[Pius X]] introduced his reform of the Roman Breviary. In many places, every diocese, order or ecclesiastical province maintained its own edition of the breviary.\n\nHowever, mendicant friars travelled frequently and needed a shortened, or abbreviated, daily office contained in one portable book, and single-volume breviaries flourished from the thirteenth century onwards. These abbreviated volumes soon became very popular and eventually supplanted the [[Catholic Church]]'s [[Curia]] office, previously said by non-monastic [[clergy]].\n\nBefore the advent of [[printing]], breviaries were written by hand and were often richly decorated with initials and miniature illustrations telling stories in the lives of [[Christ]] or the [[saint]]s, or stories from the [[Bible]]. Later printed breviaries usually have [[woodcut]] illustrations, interesting in their own right but the poor relation of the beautifully [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] breviaries.\n\nThe beauty and value of many of the Latin Breviaries were brought to the notice of English churchmen by one of the numbers of the Oxford ''[[Tracts for the Times]]'', since which time they have been much more studied, both for their own sake and for the light they throw upon the English Prayer-Book.\n\nFrom a bibliographical point of view some of the early printed Breviaries are among the rarest of literary curiosities, being merely local. The copies were not spread far, and were soon worn out by the daily use made of them. Doubtless many editions have perished without leaving a trace of their existence, while others are known by unique copies. In Scotland the only one which has survived the convulsions of the 16th century is ''[[Aberdeen Breviary]]'', a Scottish form of the Sarum Office (the [[Sarum Rite]] was much favoured in Scotland as a kind of protest against the jurisdiction claimed by the diocese of York), revised by [[William Elphinstone]] (bishop 1483\u20131514), and printed at Edinburgh by [[Walter Chepman|Walter Chapman]] and [[Androw Myllar]] in 1509\u20131510. Four copies have been preserved of it, of which only one is complete; but it was reprinted in facsimile in 1854 for the Bannatyne Club by the munificence of the [[Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch|Duke of Buccleuch]]. It is particularly valuable for the trustworthy notices of the early history of Scotland which are embedded in the lives of the national saints. Though enjoined by royal mandate in 1501 for general use within the realm of Scotland, it was probably never widely adopted. The new Scottish ''Proprium'' sanctioned for the Catholic province of St Andrews in 1903 contains many of the old Aberdeen collects and antiphons.\n\nThe Sarum or Salisbury Breviary itself was very widely used. The first edition was printed at Venice in 1483 by Raynald de Novimagio in folio; the latest at Paris, 1556, 1557. While modern Breviaries are nearly always printed in four volumes, one for each season of the year, the editions of the Sarum never exceeded two parts.\n\n== Contents of the Roman Breviary==\nAt the beginning stands the usual introductory matter, such as the tables for determining the date of Easter, the calendar, and the general rubrics. The Breviary itself is divided into four seasonal parts\u2014winter, spring, summer, autumn\u2014and comprises under each part:\n# the Psalter;\n# ''Proprium de Tempore'' (the special office of the season);\n# ''Proprium Sanctorum'' (special offices of saints);\n# ''Commune Sanctorum'' (general offices for saints);\n# Extra Services.\n\nThese parts are often published separately.\n\n=== The Psalter ===\n{{main|Latin Psalters}}\nThis psalm book is the very backbone of the Breviary, the groundwork of the Catholic prayer-book; out of it have grown the antiphons, responsories and versicles. Until the 1911 reform, the psalms were arranged according to a disposition dating from the 8th century, as follows: Psalms 1-108, with some omissions, were recited at Matins, twelve each day from Monday to Saturday, and eighteen on Sunday. The omissions were said at Lauds, Prime and Compline. Psalms 109-147 (except 117, 118, and 142) were said at Vespers, five each day. Psalms 148-150 were always used at Lauds, and give that hour its name. The text of this Psalter is that commonly known as the Gallican. The name is misleading, for it is simply the second revision (A.D. 392) made by Jerome of the old ''Itala'' version originally used in Rome. Jerome's first revision of the ''Itala'' (A.D. 383), known as the Roman, is still used at St Peter's in Rome, but the \"Gallican\", thanks especially to St Gregory of Tours, who introduced it into Gaul in the 6th century, has ousted it everywhere else. The Antiphonary of Bangor proves that Ireland accepted the Gallican version in the 7th century, and the English Church did so in the 10th.\n\nFollowing the 1911 reform, Matins was reduced to nine Psalms every day, with the other psalms redistributed throughout Prime, Terce, Sext, and Compline. For Sundays and special feasts Lauds and Vespers largely remained the same, Psalm 118 remained distributed at the Little Hours and Psalms 4, 90, and 130 were kept at Compline.\n\n=== The ''Proprium de Tempore'' ===\nThis contains the office of the seasons of the Christian year (Advent to Trinity), a conception that only gradually grew up. There is here given the whole service for every Sunday and weekday, the proper antiphons, responsories, hymns, and especially the course of daily Scripture reading, averaging about twenty verses a day, and (roughly) arranged thus:\n* Advent: Isaiah\n* Epiphany to Septuagesima: Pauline Epistles\n* Lent: patristic homilies (Genesis on Sundays)\n* Passiontide: Jeremiah\n* Easter to Pentecost: Acts, Catholic epistles and Revelation\n* Pentecost to August: Samuel and Kings\n* August to Advent: Wisdom books, Maccabees, Prophets\n\n=== The ''Proprium Sanctorum'' ===\nThis contains the lessons, psalms and liturgical formularies for saints' festivals, and depends on the days of the secular month. The readings of the second Nocturn are mainly hagiological biography, with homilies or papal documents for certain major feasts, particularly those of Jesus and Mary. Some of this material has been revised by [[Leo XIII]], in view of archaeological and other discoveries. The third Nocturn consists of a homily on the Gospel which is read at that day's Mass. Covering a great stretch of time and space, they do for the worshipper in the field of church history what the Scripture readings do in that of biblical history.\n\n=== The ''Commune Sanctorum'' ===\nThis comprises psalms, antiphons, lessons, &c., for feasts of various groups or classes (twelve in all); e.g. apostles, martyrs, confessors, virgins, and the Blessed Virgin Mary. These offices are of very ancient date, and many of them were probably in origin proper to individual saints. They contain passages of great literary beauty. The lessons read at the third nocturn are patristic homilies on the Gospels, and together form a rough summary of theological instruction.\n\n=== Extra services ===\nHere are found the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead (obligatory on All Souls' Day), and offices peculiar to each diocese.\n\n== Elements of the Hours ==\nIt has already been indicated, by reference to Matins, Lauds, &c., that not only each day, but each part of the day, has its own office, the day being divided into liturgical \"hours.\" A detailed account of these will be found in the article [[Canonical Hours]]. Each of the hours of the office is composed of the same elements, and something must be said now of the nature of these constituent parts, of which mention has here and there been already made. They are: psalms (including canticles), antiphons, responsories, hymns, lessons, little chapters, versicles and collects.\n\n=== Psalms ===\nBefore the 1911 reform, the multiplication of saints' festivals, with practically the same festal psalms, tended to repeat the about one-third of the Psalter, with a correspondingly rare recital of the remaining two-thirds. Following this reform, the entire Psalter is again generally recited each week, with the festal psalms restricted to only the highest-ranking feasts. As in the Greek usage and in the Benedictine, certain canticles like the Song of Moses (Exodus xv.), the [[Song of Hannah]] (1 Sam. ii.), the prayer of Habakkuk (iii.), the prayer of Hezekiah (Isaiah xxxviii.) and other similar Old Testament passages, and, from the New Testament, the [[Magnificat]], the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]] and the [[Nunc dimittis]], are admitted as psalms.\n\n=== Antiphons ===\nThe antiphons are short liturgical forms, sometimes of biblical, sometimes of patristic origin, used to introduce a psalm. The term originally signified a chant by alternate choirs, but has quite lost this meaning in the Breviary.\n\n=== Responsories ===\nThe responsories are similar in form to the antiphons, but come at the end of the psalm, being originally the reply of the choir or congregation to the precentor who recited the psalm.\n\n=== Hymns ===\nThe hymns are short poems going back in part to the days of [[Prudentius]], [[Synesius]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and [[Ambrose of Milan|Ambrose]] (4th and 5th centuries), but mainly the work of medieval authors.\n\n=== Lessons ===\nThe lessons, as has been seen, are drawn variously from the Bible, the [[Acts of the Saints]] and the [[Fathers of the Church]]. In the primitive church, books afterwards excluded from the canon were often read, e.g. the letters of [[Clement of Rome]] and the [[Shepherd of Hermas]]. In later days the churches of Africa, having rich memorials of martyrdom, used them to supplement the reading of Scripture. Monastic influence accounts for the practice of adding to the reading of a biblical passage some patristic commentary or exposition. Books of homilies were compiled from the writings of SS. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Hilary of Poitiers|Hilary]], [[Athanasius]], [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]], [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] and others, and formed part of the library of which the Breviary was the ultimate compendium. In the lessons, as in the psalms, the order for special days breaks in upon the normal order of ferial offices and dislocates the scheme for consecutive reading. The lessons are read at Matins (which is subdivided into three nocturns).\n\n=== Little chapters ===\nThe little chapters are very short lessons read at the other \"hours.\"\n\n=== Versicles ===\nThe versicles are short responsories used after the little chapters in the minor hours. They appear after the hymns in Lauds and Vespers.\n\n=== Collects ===\nThe collects come at the close of the office and are short prayers summing up the supplications of the congregation. They arise out of a primitive practice on the part of the bishop (local president), examples of which are found in the [[Didache|Didach\u0113]] (Teaching of the Apostles) and in the letters of Clement of Rome and Cyprian. With the crystallization of church order improvisation in prayer largely gave place to set forms, and collections of prayers were made which later developed into [[Sacramentary|Sacramentaries]] and [[Orational]]s. The collects of the Breviary are largely drawn from the Gelasian and other Sacramentaries, and they are used to sum up the dominant idea of the festival in connection with which they happen to be used.\n\n==Celebration==\nBefore 1910, the difficulty of harmonizing the ''Proprium de Tempore'' and the ''Proprium Sanctorum'', to which reference has been made, was only partly met in the thirty-seven chapters of general rubrics. Additional help was given by a kind of Catholic Churchman's Almanack, called the ''Ordo Recitandi Divini Officii'', published in different countries and dioceses, and giving, under every day, minute directions for proper reading. In 1960, John XXIII simplified the rubrics governing the Breviary in order to make it easier to use.\n\nEvery cleric in Holy Orders, and many other members of religious orders, must publicly join in or privately read aloud (i.e. using the lips as well as the eyes\u2014it takes about two hours in this way) the whole of the Breviary services allotted for each day. In large churches where they were celebrated the services were usually grouped; e.g. Matins and Lauds (about 7.30 A.M.); Prime, Terce (High Mass), Sext, and None (about 10 A.M.); Vespers and Compline (4 P.M.); and from four to eight hours (depending on the amount of music and the number of high masses) are thus spent in choir.\n\nLay use of the Breviary has varied throughout the Church's history. In some periods laymen did not use the Breviary as a manual of devotion to any great extent. The late Medieval period saw the recitation of certain hours of the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin, which was based on the Breviary in form and content, becoming popular among those who could read, and [[Bishop Challoner]] did much to popularise the hours of Sunday Vespers and Compline (albeit in English translation) in his ''Garden of the Soul'' in the eighteenth century. The Liturgical Movement in the twentieth century saw renewed interest in the Offices of the Breviary and several popular editions were produced, containing the vernacular as well as the Latin.\n\nThe complete pre-Pius X Roman Breviary was translated into English (by the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|Marquess of Bute]] in 1879; new ed. with a trans, of the Martyrology, 1908), French and German. Bute's version is noteworthy for its inclusion of the skilful renderings of the ancient hymns by J.H. Newman, J.M. Neale and others. Several editions of the Pius X Breviary were produced during the twentieth century, including a notable edition prepared with the assistance of the sisters of [[Stanbrook Abbey]] in the 1950s. Two editions in English and Latin were produced in the following decade, which conformed to the rubrics of 1960, published by Liturgical Press and Benziger in the United States. These used the Pius XII psalter. [[Baronius Press]]'s revised edition of the Liturgical Press edition uses the older Gallican psalter of St. Jerome. This edition was published and released in 2012 for pre-orders only.  In 2013, the publication has resumed printing and is available on Baronius' website.\n\nUnder Pope [[Benedict XVI]]'s [[motu proprio]] [[Summorum Pontificum]], Catholic bishops, priests, and deacons are again permitted to use the 1961 edition of the Roman Breviary, promulgated by [[Pope John XXIII]] to satisfy their obligation to recite the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] every day.\n\nIn 2008, an ''i-breviary'' was launched, which combines the ancient breviaries with the latest computer technology.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Catholicism}}\n* [[Book of Hours]]\n* [[Canonical Hours]]\n* [[Horologion]]\n* [[Latin psalters]]\n* [[Little Office of Our Lady]]\n* [[Liturgical books of the Roman Rite]]\n* [[Liturgy of the Hours]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* F.

Doc and Skinner became friends due to their parents\u2019 religiousness and both had an interest in contraptions and gadgets.  They had set up a telegraph line between their houses to send messages to each other, although they had to call each other on the telephone due to the confusing messages sent back and forth.  During one summer, Doc and Skinner started an elderberry business to gather berries and sell them door to door.  They had found out that when they picked the ripe berries, the unripe ones came off the branches too, so they built a device that was able to separate them.  The device was a bent piece of metal to form a trough. They would pour water down the trough into a bucket, and the ripe berries would sink into the bucket and the unripe ones would be pushed over the edge to be thrown away.<ref>Skinner, B. (1976).

Hamilton was known for being a strong fraternity college.  Skinner had thought that his fraternity brothers were respectful and did not haze or mistreat the newcomers, instead, they helped out the other boys with courses or other activities.  Freshmen were called \u201c\u2018slimers\u2019\u201d who had to wear small green knit hats and greet everyone that they passed for punishment.  The year before Skinner entered Hamilton, there was a hazing accident that caused the death of a student.  The freshman was asleep in his bed when he was pushed onto the floor, where he smashed his head, resulting in his death.  Skinner had a similar incident where two freshmen captured him and tied him to a pole, where he should have stayed all night, but he had a razor blade in his shoe for emergency and managed to cut himself free.<ref>Skinner, B.

After receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in English literature in 1926, he attended Harvard University, where he would later research, teach, and eventually become a prestigious board member. While he was at Harvard, a fellow student, Fred Keller, convinced Skinner that he could make an [[experimental science]] from the study of behavior. This led Skinner to invent his prototype for the [[Skinner Box]] and to join Keller in the creation of other tools for small experiments.<ref name=\"B.F. Skinner 2013\" /> After graduation, he unsuccessfully tried to write a great novel while he lived with his parents, a period that he later called the Dark Years.<ref name=\"B.F. Skinner 2013\" /> He became disillusioned with his literary skills despite encouragement from the renowned poet [[Robert Frost]], concluding that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with [[John B. Watson]]'s ''Behaviorism'' led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own version of behaviorism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=B. F.

Ten days before his death, he was given the lifetime achievement award by the American Psychological Association and gave a talk in an auditorium concerning his work.<ref>The Famous People. (2017). B. F. Skinner biography</ref>\n\nA controversial figure, Skinner has been depicted in many different ways. He has been widely revered for bringing a much-needed scientific approach to the study of human behavior; he has also been vilified for attempting to apply findings based largely on animal experiments to human behavior in real-life settings.\n\n== Contributions to psychological theory ==\n\n===Behaviorism===\n{{Main|Behaviorism|Radical behaviorism}}\nSkinner called his approach to the study of behavior [[radical behaviorism]].<ref>''About Behaviorism'' Ch. 1 ''Causes of Behavior'' \u00a7 3 ''Radical Behaviorism'' B. F. Skinner 1974 {{ISBN|0-394-71618-3}}</ref> This philosophy of behavioral science assumes that behavior is a consequence of environmental histories of reinforcement (see [[Applied behavior analysis]]). In contrast to the approach of [[cognitive science]], behaviorism does not accept private events such as thinking, perceptions, and unobservable emotions as causes of an organism's behavior. However, in contrast to methodological behaviorism, Skinner's radical behaviorism did accept thoughts, emotions, and other \"private events\" as responses subject to the same rules as overt behavior. In his words: \n<blockquote>\n The position can be stated as follows: what is felt or introspectively observed is not some nonphysical world of [[consciousness]], mind, or mental life but the observer's own body. This does not mean, as I shall show later, that introspection is a kind of psychological research, nor does it mean (and this is the heart of the argument) that what are felt or introspectively observed are the causes of the behavior. An organism behaves as it does because of its current structure, but most of this is out of reach of introspection. At the moment we must content ourselves, as the methodological behaviorist insists, with a person's genetic and environment histories. What are introspectively observed are certain collateral products of those histories.\n<br/>...<br/>\nIn this way we repair the major damage wrought by [[mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]]. When what a person does [is] attributed to what is going on inside him, investigation is brought to an end. Why explain the explanation? For twenty five hundred years people have been preoccupied with feelings and mental life, but only recently has any interest been shown in a more precise analysis of the role of the environment. Ignorance of that role led in the first place to mental fictions, and it has been perpetuated by the explanatory practices to which they gave rise.<ref>''ibid''. pp. 18\u221220 of the paperback edition which had the redacted typo s/it/is/.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Theoretical structure===\nSkinner's behavioral theory was largely set forth in his first book, ''Behavior of Organisms''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=B.F.|title=Behavior of Organisms|date=1938|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}</ref> Here he gave a systematic description of the manner in which environmental variables control behavior. He distinguished two sorts of behavior\u2014respondent and operant\u2014which are controlled in different ways.  ''Respondent'' behaviors are elicited by stimuli, and may be modified through respondent conditioning, which is often called \"Pavlovian conditioning\" or \"[[classical conditioning]]\", in which a neutral stimulus is paired with an eliciting stimulus. ''Operant'' behaviors, in contrast, are \"emitted\", meaning that initially they are not induced by any particular stimulus. They are strengthened through operant conditioning, sometimes called \"instrumental conditioning\", in which the occurrence of a response yields a reinforcer. Respondent behaviors might be measured by their latency or strength, operant behaviors by their rate. Both of these sorts of behavior had already been studied experimentally, for example, respondents by Pavlov,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pavlov|first1=I. P.|title=Conditioned Reflexes|date=1927|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford}}</ref> and operants by Thorndike.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thorndike|first1=E. L.|title=Animal Intelligence: Experimental Studies|date=1911|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}</ref> Skinner's account differed in some ways from earlier ones,<ref name=\"Jenkins\">Jenkins, H.M. \"Animal Learning and Behavior\", Ch. 5, in Hearst, E. \"The First Century of Experimental Psychology\" (1979) Erlbaum: Hillsdale, N. J.</ref> and was one of the first accounts to bring them under one roof.\n\nThe idea that behavior is strengthened or weakened by its consequences raises several questions.  Among the most important are these: (1) Operant responses are strengthened by reinforcement, but where do they come from in the first place?  (2) Once it is in the organism's repertoire, how is a response directed or controlled?  (3) How can very complex and seemingly novel behaviors be explained?{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=great questions, but were they raised by Skinner, and, if so, a source/reference should be given. If not, were they simply put here by a WP editor?}}\n\n====Origin of operant behavior====\nSkinner's answer to the first question was very much like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a \"new\" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment; a variation that is followed by reinforcement is strengthened and becomes prominent in that individual's behavioral repertoire. \"Shaping\" was Skinner's term for the gradual modification of behavior by the reinforcement of desired variations. As discussed later in this article, Skinner believed that \"superstitious\" behavior can arise when a response{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=not really needing \"clarification\" but is the best word here?}} happens to be followed by reinforcement to which it is actually unrelated.\n\n====Control of operant behavior====\nThe second question, \"how is operant behavior controlled?\" arises because, to begin with, the behavior is \"emitted\" without reference to any particular stimulus.  Skinner answered this question by saying that a stimulus comes to control an operant if it is present when the response is reinforced and absent when it is not.  For example, if lever-pressing only brings food when a light is on, a rat, or a child, will learn to press the lever only when the light is on. Skinner summarized this relationship by saying that a discriminative stimulus (e.g. light) sets the occasion for the reinforcement (food) of the operant (lever-press). This [[three-term contingency]] (stimulus-response-reinforcer) is one of Skinner's most important concepts, and sets his theory apart from theories that use only pair-wise associations.<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/>\n\n====Explaining complex behavior====\nMost behavior of humans cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one, and Skinner devoted a great deal of effort to the problem of behavioral complexity. Some complex behavior can be seen as a sequence of relatively simple responses, and here Skinner invoked the idea of \"chaining.\"  Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a \"conditioned reinforcer.\" For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may also be used to reinforce \"turning around\" in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence \"noise - turn-around - light - press lever - food.\" Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.\n\nHowever, Skinner recognized that a great deal of behavior, especially human behavior, cannot be accounted for by gradual shaping or the construction of response sequences.<ref name=\"Contingencies\">Skinner, B. F. (1966) Contingencies of Reinforcement, New York; Appleton-Century-Crofts. reprinted 2013, B. F. Skinner Foundation.</ref> Complex behavior often appears suddenly in its final form, as when a person first finds his way to the elevator by following instructions given at the front desk. To account for such behavior, Skinner introduced the concept of rule-governed behavior. First, relatively simple behaviors come under the control of verbal stimuli: the child learns to \"jump\", \"open the book\", and so on.  After a large number of responses come under such verbal control, a sequence of verbal stimuli can evoke an almost unlimited variety of complex responses.<ref name=\"Contingencies\"/>\n\n===Reinforcement===\n{{Main|Reinforcement}}\nReinforcement, a key concept of [[behaviorism]], is the primary process that shapes and controls behavior, and occurs in two ways, \"positive\" and \"negative.\"  In ''The Behavior of Organisms'' (1938), Skinner defined \"negative reinforcement\" to be synonymous with [[punishment]], that is, the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Subsequently, in ''Science and Human Behavior'' (1953), Skinner redefined negative reinforcement. In what has now become the standard set of definitions, positive reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the occurrence of some event (e.g., praise after some behavior is performed), whereas negative reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the removal or avoidance of some aversive event (e.g., opening and raising an umbrella over your head on a rainy day is reinforced by the cessation of rain falling on you).\n\nBoth types of reinforcement strengthen behavior, or increase the probability of a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied ([[positive reinforcement]]) or something removed or avoided ([[negative reinforcement]]). Punishment is the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation) or the removal of a desirable stimulus ([[negative punishment]] or punishment by contingent withdrawal). Though punishment is often used to suppress behavior, Skinner argued that this suppression is temporary and has a number of other, often unwanted, consequences.<ref>Skinner, B. F. Science and Human Behavior (1953) New York: Macmillan</ref> Extinction is the absence of a rewarding stimulus, which weakens behavior.\n\nWriting in 1981, Skinner pointed out that Darwinian natural selection is, like reinforced behavior, \"selection by consequences.\" Though, as he said, natural selection has now \"made its case\", he regretted that essentially the same process, \"reinforcement\", was less widely accepted as underlying human behavior.<ref name=Skinner1981>{{Cite journal |date=July 31, 1981 |author=Skinner, B.F |title=Selection by Consequences |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=213 |issue=4507 |pages=501\u2013504 |doi=10.1126/science.7244649 |url=http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

B. Ferster, he did an extensive analysis of the various ways in which reinforcements could be arranged over time, which he called \"[[schedules of reinforcement]].\"<ref name=\"Schedules\">Ferster, C. B. and Skinner, B. F.  Schedules of Reinforcement.  New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1957</ref>\n\nThe most notable schedules of reinforcement studied by Skinner were continuous, interval (fixed or variable), and ratio (fixed or variable). All are methods used in [[operant conditioning]].\n\n* '''Continuous reinforcement (CRF)''' \u2014 each time a specific action is performed the subject receives a reinforcement. This method is effective when teaching a new behavior because it quickly establishes an association between the target behavior and the reinforcer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Different Types of Reinforcement Scedules|url=http://autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/sites/autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/files/Reinforcement-Table1.pdf|website=autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu|publisher=National Professional Development Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref>\n* '''Interval Schedules''' \u2014 based on the time intervals between reinforcements<ref name=\"Psychology 2nd Edition\">Psychology 2nd Edition</ref>\n**'''Fixed Interval Schedule (FI)''': A procedure in which reinforcements are presented at fixed time periods, provided that the appropriate response is made. This schedule yields a response rate that is low just after reinforcement and becomes rapid just before the next reinforcement is scheduled.\n**'''Variable Interval Schedule (VI)''': A procedure in which behavior is reinforced after random time durations following the last reinforcement. This schedule yields steady responding at a rate that varies with the average frequency of reinforcement.\n*'''Ratio Schedules''' \u2014 based on the ratio of responses to reinforcements<ref name=\"Psychology 2nd Edition\"/>\n**'''Fixed Ratio Schedule (FR)''':  A procedure in which reinforcement is delivered after a specific number of responses have been made.\n**'''Variable Ratio Schedule (VR)''': A procedure in which reinforcement comes after a number of responses that is randomized from one reinforcement to the next (ex. slot machines). The lower the number of responses required, the higher the response rate tends to be. Ratio schedules tend to produce very rapid responding, often with breaks of no responding just after reinforcement if a large number of responses is required for reinforcement.<ref>Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M. Wegner. (2011). Schedules of Reinforcement. Psychology second edition.</ref>\n\n==Scientific inventions==\n\n=== Operant conditioning chamber ===\n{{Main|Operant conditioning chamber}}\nAn [[operant conditioning chamber]] (also known as a ''Skinner Box'') is a laboratory apparatus used in the experimental analysis of animal behavior.  It was invented by Skinner while he was a graduate student at [[Harvard University]]. As used by Skinner, the box had a lever (for rats), or a disk in one wall (for pigeons). A press on this \"manipulandum\" could deliver food to the animal through an opening in the wall, and responses reinforced in this way increased in frequency. By controlling this reinforcement together with discriminative stimuli such as lights and tones, or punishments such as electric shocks, experimenters have used the operant box to study a wide variety of topics, including schedules of reinforcement, discriminative control, delayed response (\"memory\"), punishment, and so on. By channeling research in these directions, the operant conditioning chamber has had a huge influence on course of research in animal learning and its applications. It enabled great progress on problems that could be studied by measuring the rate, probability, or force of a simple, repeatable response. However, it discouraged the study of behavioral processes not easily conceptualized in such terms\u2014spatial learning, in particular, which is now studied in quite different ways, for example, by the use of the [[Water maze (neuroscience)|water maze]].<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/>\n\n=== Cumulative recorder ===\n\nThe cumulative recorder makes a pen-and-ink record of simple repeated responses. Skinner designed it for use with the [[Operant chamber]] as a convenient way to record and view the rate of responses such as a lever press or a key peck.  In this device, a sheet of paper gradually unrolls over a cylinder.  Each response steps a small pen across the paper, starting at one edge; when the pen reaches the other edge, it quickly resets to the initial side. The slope of the resulting ink line graphically displays the rate of the response; for example, rapid responses yield a steeply sloping line on the paper, slow responding yields a line of low slope. The cumulative recorder was a key tool used by Skinner in his analysis of behavior, and it was very widely adopted by other experimenters, gradually falling out of use with the advent of the laboratory computer.{{citation needed |date=May 2016}}  Skinner's major experimental exploration of response rates, presented in his book with C.

Reportedly it had some success in these goals.<ref name=\"snopes\" />\n\nThe air crib was a controversial invention.

The machine embodies key elements of Skinner\u2019s theory of learning and had important implications for education in general and classroom instruction in particular.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=B. F.|title=Why we need teaching machines|journal=Harvard Educational Review|year=1961|volume=31|pages=377\u2013398}}</ref>\n\nIn one incarnation, the machine was a box that housed a list of questions that could be viewed one at a time through a small window. (See picture). There was also a mechanism through which the learner could respond to each question. Upon delivering a correct answer, the learner would be rewarded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/smcneil/cuin6373/idhistory/1950.html|title=Programmed Instruction and Task Analysis|publisher=College of Education, University of Houston}}</ref>\n\nSkinner advocated the use of teaching machines for a broad range of students (e.g., preschool aged to adult) and instructional purposes (e.g., reading and music). For example, one machine that he envisioned could teach rhythm. He wrote:<blockquote>A relatively simple device supplies the necessary contingencies. The student taps a rhythmic pattern in unison with the device. \"Unison\" is specified very loosely at first (the student can be a little early or late at each tap) but the specifications are slowly sharpened. The process is repeated for various speeds and patterns. In another arrangement, the student echoes rhythmic patterns sounded by the machine, though not in unison, and again the specifications for an accurate reproduction are progressively sharpened. Rhythmic patterns can also be brought under the control of a printed score.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner | first1 = B.F. | year = 1961 | title = Teaching machines | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue = | pages = 90\u2013112 | doi = 10.2307/1926170 }}</ref></blockquote>The instructional potential of the teaching machine stemmed from several factors: it provided automatic, immediate and regular reinforcement without the use of aversive control; the material presented was coherent, yet varied and novel; the pace of learning could be adjusted to suit the individual. As a result, students were interested, attentive, and learned efficiently by producing the desired behavior, \"learning by doing.\"<ref>Skinner, B. F. and Holland, J. \"The Analysis of Behavior: A Program for Self Instruction\", 1961, p.387</ref>\n\nTeaching machines, though perhaps rudimentary, were not rigid instruments of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved based upon the students' performance. For example, if a student made many incorrect responses, the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions\u2014the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently if they make few errors. Multiple-choice formats were not well-suited for teaching machines because they tended to increase student mistakes, and the contingencies of reinforcement were relatively uncontrolled.\n\nNot only useful in teaching explicit skills, machines could also promote the development of a repertoire of behaviors that Skinner called self-management. Effective self-management means attending to stimuli appropriate to a task, avoiding distractions, reducing the opportunity of reward for competing behaviors, and so on. For example, machines encourage students to pay attention before receiving a reward. Skinner contrasted this with the common classroom practice of initially capturing students\u2019 attention (e.g., with a lively video) and delivering a reward (e.g., entertainment) before the students have actually performed any relevant behavior. This practice fails to reinforce correct behavior and actually counters the development of self-management.\n\nSkinner pioneered the use of teaching machines in the classroom, especially at the primary level. Today computers run software that performs similar teaching tasks, and there has been a resurgence of interest in the topic related to the development of adaptive learning systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philmcrae.com/2/post/2013/04/rebirth-of-the-teaching-maching-through-the-seduction-of-data-analytics-this-time-its-personal1.html|title=Rebirth of the Teaching Machine through the Seduction of Data Analytics: This Time It's Personal|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Pigeon-guided missile ===\n{{Main|Project Pigeon}}\nDuring World War II, the [[US Navy]] required a weapon effective against surface ships, such as the German [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'' class]] battleships.

Lenses projected an image of distant objects onto a screen in front of each bird.

Skinner argued that education has two major purposes: (1) to teach repertoires of both verbal and nonverbal behavior; and (2) to interest students in learning. He recommended bringing students\u2019 behavior under appropriate control by providing reinforcement only in the presence of stimuli relevant to the learning task. Because he believed that human behavior can be affected by small consequences, something as simple as \"the opportunity to move forward after completing one stage of an activity\" can be an effective reinforcer <!-- What is this a citation from? -->. Skinner was convinced that, to learn, a student must engage in behavior, and not just passively receive information. (Skinner, 1961, p.&nbsp;389).\n\nSkinner believed that effective teaching must be based on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, if a child is forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of [[rote learning]] and [[school discipline|punitive discipline]] in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.<ref name=\"Holland\">Holland, J. (1992). B.F Skinner. Pittsburgh: American Psychologist</ref>\n\nBecause teachers are primarily responsible for modifying student behavior, Skinner argued that teachers must learn effective ways of teaching. In ''The Technology of Teaching'', Skinner has a chapter on why teachers fail (pages 93\u2013113): He says that teachers have not been given an in-depth understanding of [[teaching]] and [[learning]]. Without knowing the science underpinning teaching, teachers fall back on procedures that work poorly or not at all, such as:\n:* using aversive techniques (which produce escape and avoidance and undesirable emotional effects);\n:* relying on telling and explaining (\"Unfortunately, a student does not learn simply when he is shown or told.\" p.&nbsp;103);\n:* failing to adapt learning tasks to the student's current level;\n:* failing to provide positive reinforcement frequently enough.\n\nSkinner suggests that any age-appropriate skill can be taught. The steps are\n#Clearly specify the action or performance the student is to learn.\n#Break down the task into small achievable steps, going from simple to complex.\n#Let the student perform each step, reinforcing correct actions.\n#Adjust so that the student is always successful until finally the goal is reached.\n#Shift to intermittent reinforcement to maintain the student's performance.\nSkinner's views on education are extensively presented in his book ''The Technology of Teaching''. They are also reflected in [[Fred S. Keller]]'s ''Personalized System of Instruction'' and [[Ogden Lindsley|Ogden R. Lindsley]]'s ''[[Precision teaching|Precision Teaching]]''.\n\n== ''Walden Two'' and ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' ==\nSkinner is popularly known mainly for his books ''[[Walden Two]]'' and ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]],'' (for which he made the cover of ''[[TIME]]'' Magazine).<ref>{{cite web |title=B.F.

Skinner, (1968). \"The Design of Experimental Communities\", ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (Volume 16). New York: Macmillan, 1968, pages 271-275.</ref> in 1940s United States. The productivity and happiness of citizens in this community is far greater than in the outside world because the residents practice scientific social planning and use operant conditioning in raising their children.\n\n''Walden Two'', like [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'', champions a lifestyle that does not support war, or foster competition and social strife. It encourages a lifestyle of minimal consumption, rich social relationships, personal happiness, satisfying work, and leisure.<ref>Ramsey, Richard David, ''Morning Star: The Values-Communication of Skinner's '''Walden Two''''', Ph.D. dissertation, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, December 1979, available from University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, MI.

The community still exists and continues to use the Planner-Manager system and other aspects of the community described in Skinner's book, though behavior modification is not a community practice.<ref>{{cite book|title=Living Walden Two: B. F. Skinner's Behaviorist Utopia and Experimental Communities|author=Hilke Kuhlman|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date= Oct 1, 2010|page=87}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', Skinner suggests that a technology of behavior could help to make a better society. We would, however, have to accept that an [[autonomous agent]] is not the driving force of our actions. Skinner offers alternatives to punishment, and challenges his readers to use science and modern technology to construct a better society.\n\n== Political views ==\nSkinner's political writings emphasized his hopes that an effective and human science of behavioral control \u2013 a technology of human behavior \u2013 could help with problems as yet unsolved and often aggravated by advances in technology such as the [[atomic bomb]]. Indeed, one of Skinner's goals was to prevent humanity from destroying itself.<ref>see Beyond Freedom and Dignity, 1974 for example</ref> He saw political activity as the use of aversive or non-aversive means to control a population. Skinner favored the use of [[positive reinforcement]] as a means of control, citing [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s novel ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'' as an example of literature that \"did not fear the power of positive reinforcement.\"<ref name=\"W2\"/>\n\nSkinner's book, ''Walden Two'', presents a vision of a decentralized, localized society, which applies a practical, scientific approach and behavioral expertise to deal peacefully with social problems. (For example, his views led him to oppose corporal punishment in schools, and he wrote a letter to the California Senate that helped lead it to a ban on spanking.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nanette |last=Asimov |title=Spanking Debate Hits Assembly |work=SFGate|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=January 30, 1996 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/01/30/MN71634.DTL&hw=spanking+debate&sn=009&sc=334 |accessdate=March 2, 2008}}</ref>) Skinner's [[utopia]] is both a thought experiment and a [[rhetoric]]al piece. In ''Walden Two'', Skinner answers the problem that exists in many utopian novels \u2013 \"What is the Good Life?\" The book's answer is a life of friendship, health, art, a healthy balance between work and leisure, a minimum of unpleasantness, and a feeling that one has made worthwhile contributions to a society in which resources are ensured, in part, by minimizing consumption. \n{{quote|If the world is to save any part of its resources for the future, it must reduce not only consumption but the number of consumers.|B.

Buckley Jr, ''On the Firing Line'', p.&nbsp;87.}}\n\n== Superstition in the pigeon ==\nOne of Skinner's experiments examined the formation of [[superstition]] in one of his favorite experimental animals, the [[pigeon]]. Skinner placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon \"at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird's behavior.\" He discovered that the pigeons associated the delivery of the food with whatever chance actions they had been performing as it was delivered, and that they subsequently continued to perform these same actions.<ref>[http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/financial-markets/content/sessions/session-8-human-foibles-fraud-manipulation-and ECON 252, Lecture 8] by Professor Robert Schiller at Yale University</ref>\n\n{{quote|One bird was conditioned to turn counter-clockwise about the cage, making two or three turns between reinforcements. Another repeatedly thrust its head into one of the upper corners of the cage. A third developed a 'tossing' response, as if placing its head beneath an invisible bar and lifting it repeatedly. Two birds developed a pendulum motion of the head and body, in which the head was extended forward and swung from right to left with a sharp movement followed by a somewhat slower return.<ref name=superstition>Skinner, B. F. \"'Superstition' in the Pigeon\", ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' #38, 1947.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Pigeon/|title=Classics in the History of Psychology -- Skinner (1948)|publisher=}}</ref>}}\n\nSkinner suggested that the pigeons behaved as if they were influencing the automatic mechanism with their \"rituals\", and that this experiment shed light on human behavior:\n\n{{quote|The experiment might be said to demonstrate a sort of superstition. The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking. There are many analogies in human behavior. Rituals for changing one's fortune at cards are good examples. A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many unreinforced instances. The bowler who has released a ball down the alley but continues to behave as if she were controlling it by twisting and turning her arm and shoulder is another case in point. These behaviors have, of course, no real effect upon one's luck or upon a ball half way down an alley, just as in the present case the food would appear as often if the pigeon did nothing\u2014or, more strictly speaking, did something else.<ref name=superstition />}}\n\nModern behavioral psychologists have disputed Skinner's \"superstition\" explanation for the behaviors he recorded. Subsequent research (e.g. Staddon and Simmelhag, 1971), while finding similar behavior, failed to find support for Skinner's \"adventitious reinforcement\" explanation for it. By looking at the timing of different behaviors within the interval, Staddon and Simmelhag were able to distinguish two classes of behavior: the ''terminal response'', which occurred in anticipation of food, and ''interim responses'', that occurred earlier in the interfood interval and were rarely contiguous with food. Terminal responses seem to reflect classical (as opposed to operant) conditioning, rather than adventitious reinforcement, guided by a process like that observed in 1968 by Brown and Jenkins in their \"autoshaping\" procedures. The causation of interim activities (such as the schedule-induced [[polydipsia]] seen in a similar situation with rats) also cannot be traced to adventitious reinforcement and its details are still obscure (Staddon, 1977).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The basis of superstitious behavior: chance contingency, stimulus substitution, or appetitive behavior?|first1=W|last1=Timberlake|first2=G A|last2=Lucas|date=November 1, 1985|publisher=|journal=J Exp Anal Behav|volume=44|issue=3|pages=279\u2013299|doi=10.1901/jeab.1985.44-279|pmid=4086972|pmc=1348192}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n=== J. E. R. Staddon ===\nAs understood by Skinner, ascribing ''dignity'' to individuals involves giving them credit for their actions. To say \"Skinner is brilliant\" means that Skinner is an originating force. If Skinner's [[determinism|determinist]] theory is right, he is merely the focus of his environment. He is not an originating force and he had no choice in saying the things he said or doing the things he did. Skinner's environment and genetics both allowed and compelled him to write his book. Similarly, the environment and genetic potentials of the advocates of freedom and dignity cause them to resist the reality that their own activities are deterministically grounded. [[J. E. R. Staddon]] (''The New Behaviorism, 2nd Edition'', 2014) has argued the [[Compatibilism|compatibilist position]]; Skinner's determinism is not in any way contradictory to traditional notions of reward and punishment, as he believed.<ref>Staddon, J.

Among Chomsky's criticisms were that Skinner's laboratory work could not be extended to humans, that when it was extended to humans it represented '[[Scientism|scientistic]]' behavior attempting to emulate science but which was not scientific, that Skinner was not a scientist because he rejected the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] of theory testing, and that Skinner had no science of behavior.<ref>A.

Knight is best known as the head coach of the [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]] from 1971 to 2000.

He has also been praised for running clean programs (none of his teams was ever sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations), and most of his players graduated. However, Knight has also sparked controversy: he famously threw a chair across the court during a game, was once arrested for [[assault]], and regularly displayed a combative nature during encounters with members of the press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/23171291 |title=Pat Knight to mine for players in Indiana |publisher=Nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=2008-02-15 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref> Knight remains \"the object of near fanatical devotion\" from many of his former players and Indiana fans.<ref name=\"darkside\">{{cite news|title=A dark side of Knight|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/thenetwork/news/2000/03/14/knight_indiana/|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=CNN/Si|date=10 September 2000}}</ref> Nevertheless, his combative nature and unacceptable pattern of behavior led to his firing from Indiana University in 2000.<ref>http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100606</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Knight joined [[ESPN]] as a men's college basketball studio analyst during Championship Week and for coverage of the NCAA Tournament.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3269476 |title=Bob Knight joins ESPN for Championship Week and NCAA Tournament |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2008-02-29 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref> He continued covering college basketball for ESPN through the 2014\u201315 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2015/04/02/bob-knight-not-renewed-espn |title=Source: ESPN will not renew contract of college hoops analyst Bob Knight |publisher=si.com |date=2015-04-02 |accessdate=2015-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nKnight was born in 1940 [[Massillon, Ohio]], and grew up in [[Orrville, Ohio]].<ref name=\"www2.indystar.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/k/knight_bob/knight.html |title=Bob Knight |work=Indianapolis Star |date=2008-02-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419194719/http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/k/knight_bob/knight.html |archivedate=2010-04-19|accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref> Knight began playing organized basketball at [[Orrville High School]]. He continued at [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] in 1958 when he played for [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] coach [[Fred R. Taylor|Fred Taylor]]. Despite being a star player in high school, he played a reserve role as a forward on the [[1959\u201360 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|1960 Ohio State Buckeyes team]] that won the NCAA Championship and featured future Hall of Fame players [[John Havlicek]] and [[Jerry Lucas]]. The Buckeyes lost to the [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati Bearcats]] in each of the next two NCAA Championship games, of which Knight was also a part.\n\nDue in part to the star power of those Ohio State teams, Knight usually received scant playing time, but that did not prevent him from making an impact. In the 1961 NCAA Championship game, Knight came off the bench with 1:41 on the clock and Cincinnati leading Ohio State, 61-59. In the words of then-Ohio State assistant coach [[Frank Truitt]],\n<blockquote>Knight got the ball in the left front court and faked a drive into the middle.

In six seasons at West Point, Knight won 102 games, with his first as a head coach coming against [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]. One of his players was [[Mike Krzyzewski]], who later served as his assistant before becoming a Hall of Fame head coach at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]. [[Mike Silliman]] was another of Knight's players at Army, and Knight was quoted as saying, \"Mike Silliman is the best player I have ever coached.\"\n\nDuring his tenure at Army, Knight gained a reputation for having an explosive temper.  For example, after Army's 66-60 loss to BYU and Hall of Fame coach [[Stan Watts]] in the semifinals of the [[1966 National Invitation Tournament|1966 NIT]], Knight completely lost control, kicking lockers and verbally blasting the officials.  Embarrassed, he later went to Watts' hotel room and apologized.  Watts forgave him, and is quoted as saying, \"I want you to know that you're going to be one of the bright young coaches in the country, and it's just a matter of time before you win a national championship.\"<ref>Rock, Brad, and Lee Warnick.

The following season, 1973\u201374, Indiana once again captured a Big Ten title. In the two following seasons, [[1974\u201375 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1974\u201375]] and [[1975\u201376 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1975\u201376]], the Hoosiers were undefeated in the regular season and won 37-consecutive Big Ten games, including two more Big Ten championships. The [[1974\u201375 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1974\u201375]] Hoosiers swept the entire Big Ten by an average of 22.8 points per game. However, in an 83\u201382 win against [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]] they lost consensus All-American forward [[Scott May]] to a broken left arm. With May's injury keeping him to 7 minutes of play, the No. 1 Hoosiers lost to [[1974\u201375 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] 92\u201390 in the [[1975 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Mideast Regional]].

The following season, in [[1980\u201381 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1980\u201381]], Thomas and the Hoosiers once again won a conference title and won the [[1981 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1981 NCAA tournament]], Knight's second national title. In 1982\u20131983, with the strong play of [[Uwe Blab]] and All-Americans [[Ted Kitchel]] and [[Randy Wittman]], the No. 1 ranked Hoosiers were favorites to win another national championship. However, with an injury to All-American [[Ted Kitchel]] mid-season, the Hoosiers' prospects were grim. Knight asked for fan support to rally around the team and, when the team ultimately won the Big Ten title, he ordered that a banner be hung for the team in [[Assembly Hall (Bloomington)|Assembly Hall]] as a tribute to the fans, who he credited with inspiring the team to win its final three home games. Nevertheless, in the tournament Kitchel's absence was felt and the team lost to Kentucky in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1983 Sweet Sixteen]].\n\n[[File:Knight with young fans.jpg|thumb|Knight with young fans at [[Frank Truitt]]'s house in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], summer of 1988]]\nThe [[1985\u201386 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1985\u201386]] Hoosiers were profiled in a best-selling book ''[[A Season on the Brink]]''.

Teams from these three seasons spent all but two of the 53 poll weeks in the top 10, and 38 of them in the top 5. They captured two Big Ten crowns in 1990\u201391 and [[1992\u201393 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1992\u201393]], and during the [[1991\u201392 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1991\u201392]] season reached the [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four]]. During the [[1992\u201393 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1992\u201393]] season, the 31\u20134 Hoosiers finished the season at the top of the [[AP Poll]], but were defeated by [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] in the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Elite Eight]]. Teams from this era included [[Greg Graham]], [[Pat Knight]], All-Americans [[Damon Bailey]] and [[Alan Henderson]], and National Player of the Year [[Calbert Cheaney]].\n\nThroughout the mid and late 1990s Knight continued to experience success with continual NCAA tournament appearances and a minimum of 19 wins each season. However, 1993 would be Knight's last conference championship and 1994 would be his last trip to the Sweet Sixteen.\n\n====Dismissal from Indiana====\nOn March 14, 2000 (just before Indiana was to begin play in the NCAA tournament), the [[CNN Sports Illustrated]] network ran a piece on Knight in which former player [[Neil Reed]] claimed he had been choked by Knight during a 1997 practice.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Knight Tape: Video captures encounter between IU coach, ex-player|publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|date=2000-09-09|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/thenetwork/news/2000/04/11/knight_cnnsi/|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref> Knight denied the claims in the story.

Brand asked Knight to resign on September 10, and when Knight refused, Brand relieved him of his coaching duties effective immediately. Knight's dismissal was met with outrage from students. That night, thousands of Indiana students marched from Indiana University's Assembly Hall to Brand's home, burning Brand in [[effigy]].<ref name=\"Fired\" />\n\nHarvey was supported by some and vilified by many who claim he had intentionally set up Knight.

He led the team to postseason appearances in each of his first four years at the school (three NCAA Championship tournaments and one NIT). After a rough 2006 season, the team improved in 2007, finishing 21\u201313 and again making it to the NCAA Championship tournament, where it lost to [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] in the first round. The best performance by the Red Raiders under Knight came in 2005 when they advanced as far as the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]]. In both 2006 and 2007 under Knight, Texas Tech defeated two Top 10-ranked teams in consecutive weeks. During Knight's first six years at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders won 126 games, an average of 21 wins per season.\n\n===Retirement===\nOn February 4, 2008, Knight announced his retirement.

This required players to be unselfish, disciplined, and effective in setting and using [[screen (basketball)|screens]] to get open.\n\nKnight's motion offense didn't take shape until he began coaching at Indiana. Prior to that, at Army, he ran a \"reverse action\" that involved reversing the ball from one side of the floor to the other and screening along with it.<ref name=\"walker\"/> According to Knight, it was a \"West Coast offense\" that [[Pete Newell]] used exclusively during his coaching career. After being exposed to the [[Princeton offense]], Knight instilled more cutting with the offense he employed, which evolved into the motion offense that he ran for most of his career.<ref name=\"walker\"/> Knight continued to develop the offense, instituting different cuts over the years and putting his players in different scenarios.\n\nKnight was well known for the extreme preparation he put into each game and practice.

Although he opposed the rule change throughout his life, it did complement his offense well by improving the spacing on the floor.<ref name=\"walker\"/> He sardonically said at the time that he supported institution of the three point shot because if a team's offense was functioning efficiently enough to get a layup the team should be rewarded with three points for that basket.

Players with the ball are expected to hold the ball for two seconds to see where they are going to take it. Screens are supposed to be held for two seconds, as well.\n\nOn defense Knight was known for emphasizing tenacious \"man-to-man\" defense where defenders contest every pass and every shot, and help teammates when needed.

He was named the National Coach of the Year four times (1975, 1976, 1987, 1989) and Big Ten Coach of the Year eight times (1973, 1975, 1976, 1980, 1981, 1989, 1992, 1993). In 1975 he was a unanimous selection as National Coach of the Year, an honor he was accorded again in 1976 by the Associated Press, United Press International, and ''Basketball Weekly''. In 1987 he was the first person to be honored with the [[Naismith College Coach of the Year|Naismith Coach of the Year Award]]. In 1989 he garnered National Coach of the Year honors by the AP, UPI, and the United States Basketball Writers Association. Knight was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 1991.\n\n[[File:Coach-k-knight.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Army point-guard [[Mike Krzyzewski]] and Coach Knight, circa 1968]]\nOn November 17, 2006, Knight was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the [[National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame]].

In August 2003, he was honored as the first inductee in The Vince Lombardi Titletown Legends.\n\n===Coaching tree===\n{{Main article|Coaching legacy of Bob Knight}}\nA number of Knight's assistant coaches, players, and managers have gone on to be coaches. Among them are Hall of Fame Duke coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]], UCLA coach [[Steve Alford]], [[Murry Bartow]] and NBA coaches [[Randy Wittman]], [[Mike Woodson]], [[Keith Smart]], [[Isiah Thomas]], Evansville Coach [[Marty Simmons]], St. Louis Coach [[Jim Crews]], [[Lawrence Frank]] and [[Texas Tech]] coach [[Chris Beard (basketball)|Chris Beard]].\n\n==In the media==\n\n===Books about Knight===\nIn 1986 author [[John Feinstein]] published ''[[A Season on the Brink]]'', which detailed the [[1985\u201386 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1985\u201386 season]] of the [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]]. Granted almost unprecedented access to the Indiana basketball program, as well as insights into Knight's private life, the book quickly became a major best-seller and spawned a new genre, as a legion of imitators wrote works covering a single year of a sports franchise. In the book Feinstein depicts a coach who is quick with a violent temper, but also one who never cheats and strictly follows all of the NCAA's rules.\n\nTwo years later, author Joan Mellen penned the book ''Bob Knight: His Own Man'' ({{ISBN|0-380-70809-4}}), in part to rebut Feinstein's ''A Season on the Brink''. Mellen deals with seemingly all the causes celebres in Knight's career and presents the view that he is more sinned against than sinning.\n\nA number of close associates and friends of Knight have also written books about him. Former player and current [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] head basketball coach [[Steve Alford]] wrote ''Playing for Knight: My Six Seasons with Bobby Knight'', published in 1990.\n\nKnight's autobiography, written with longtime friend and sports journalist Bob Hammel, was titled ''Knight: My Story'' and published in 2003. Three years later Steve Delsohn and Mark Heisler wrote ''Bob Knight: An Unauthorized Biography''.\n\n===Film and television===\nKnight has appeared or been featured in numerous films and television productions. In 1994 a feature film titled ''[[Blue Chips]]'' featured a character named Pete Bell, a volatile but honest college basketball coach under pressure to win who decides to blatantly violate NCAA rules to field a competitive team after a sub-par season. It starred [[Nick Nolte]] as Bell and NBA star [[Shaquille O'Neal]] as Neon Bodeaux, a once-in-a-lifetime player Bell woos to his school with gifts and other perks. The coach's temper and wardrobe were modeled after Knight's, though at no time had Knight been known to illegally recruit. Knight himself appears in the movie and coaches against Nolte in the film's climactic game.\n\n[[ESPN]]'s first feature-length film was ''[[A Season on the Brink]]'', a 2002 TV adaptation from John Feinstein's book. In the movie Knight is played by veteran character actor [[Brian Dennehy]]. ESPN also featured Knight in a [[reality television|reality show]] titled ''[[Knight School (U.S. TV series)|Knight School]]'', which followed a handful of Texas Tech students as they competed for the right to join the basketball team as a non-scholarship player.\n\nKnight made a cameo appearance as himself in the 2003 film ''[[Anger Management (film)|Anger Management]]''. In 2008, Knight appeared in a commercial as part of [[Volkswagen]]'s Das Auto series where Max, a 1964 black [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] interviews famous people. When Knight talked about Volkswagen winning the best resale value award in 2008, Max replied, \"At least one of us is winning a title this year.\" This prompted Knight to throw his chair off the stage and walk out saying, \"I may not be retired.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Angry Bob Knight Yells At Volkswagen|publisher=Jalopnik|url=http://jalopnik.com/377439/angry-bob-knight-yells-at-volkswagen|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref>\n\nKnight also made an appearance in a TV commercial for [[Guitar Hero: Metallica]] with fellow coaches [[Mike Krzyzewski]], [[Rick Pitino]], and [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]], in a parody of [[Tom Cruise]] in ''[[Risky Business]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/sports/story/1464998.html |title=Roy, Coach K take a turn as 'Guitar Heroes' |last=van der Horst |first=Roger |date=2009-03-31 |work=[[The News & Observer]] |accessdate=2009-03-31 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Knight produced three instructional coaching DVD libraries\u2014on motion offense, man-to-man defense, and instilling mental toughness\u2014with Championship Productions.\n\n==Personal life and charitable donations==\n[[File:Bobknight.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Knight with his son [[Pat Knight|Pat]] while coaching at Texas Tech.]]\nKnight married the former Nancy Falk<ref name=\"BK: TUB\">{{cite book|last1=Delsohn|first1=Steve|last2=Heisler|first2=Mark|title=Bob Knight : the unauthorized biography|date=2006|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9780743243483|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk_rW5ls5ZMC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=bob+knight+nancy+falk&source=bl&ots=EX6Cvmh0S7&sig=KsiYLXgapWB0zAxwW7Oe7tpss-M&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3hdqatbPMAhVBv44KHVqaB00Q6AEIRDAK#v=onepage&q=bob%20knight%20nancy%20falk&f=false|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref> on April 17, 1963.

Pat played at Indiana from 1991 to 1995 and served as head coach at [[Lamar Cardinals basketball|Lamar]] from the time of his father's retirement until he was dismissed in 2014.  Pat Knight coached Texas Tech after his father's retirement before he moved to Lamar. In 1988, Knight married his second wife, Karen Vieth Edgar, a former Oklahoma high school basketball coach.<ref>http://fabwags.com/karen-vieth-knight-bob-knights-wife/</ref>\n\nKnight has a high regard for education and has made generous donations to the schools he has been a part of, particularly libraries. At [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] Knight endowed two chairs, one in history and one in law. He also raised nearly $5 million for the Indiana University library system by championing a library fund to support the library's activities. The fund was ultimately named in his honor.{{citation needed|date = March 2015}}\n\nWhen Knight came to Texas Tech in 2001, he gave $10,000 to the library, the first gift to the Coach Knight Library Fund which has now collected over $300,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2007/11/30/LaVida/A.Knights.Tale.Tech.Library.Honors.Coach.Knight.For.Donations.Generosity-3124358.shtml?reffeature=htmlemailedition |title=A Knight's Tale: Tech library honors coach Knight for donations, generosity - La Vida |publisher=Media.www.dailytoreador.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> On November 29, 2007, the Texas Tech library honored this with ''A Legacy of Giving: The Bob Knight Exhibit''.<ref>\nSamples, Ben. \u201cExhibit Honoring Coach Bob Knight Opens.\u201d today.ttu.edu.

Near the end of the game, Bob Knight went to the Kentucky bench where the official was standing to complain about a call. Before he left, Knight hit Kentucky coach [[Joe B. Hall]] in the back of the head.<ref>{{cite web|title=Recapping the rivalry|url=http://kentucky.247sports.com/Article/Recapping-the-top-5-games-in-the-Kentucky-Indiana-hoops-rivalry-52292|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> UK's assistant coach Lynn Nance, a former FBI agent who was about 6 feet 5 inches, had to be restrained by Hall from hitting Knight. Hall later said, \"It publicly humiliated me.\"<ref>''Atlanta Constitution Journal'', 28 February 1982.{{verify source|date=April 2017}}</ref> Knight said the slap to the head was something he has done, \"affectionately\" to his own players for years. \"But maybe someone would not like that,\" he said. \"If Joe didn't like it, I offer an apology.

Early in his tenure while he jogged in the practice facility during basketball practice, Knight yelled at him to leave, using more than one expletive. Blubaugh pinned Knight to a wall, and told him never to repeat his performance. He never did.<ref>[http://newsok.com/article/5559704| \"Doug Blubaugh was tougher than he was good,\" NewsOK, Barry Tramel, 10 August 2017]</ref>\n\n===1980s===\n* In a game at Bloomington on January 31, 1981 between Indiana and Purdue, Hoosier star [[Isiah Thomas]] allegedly hit Purdue guard [[Roosevelt Barnes (American football)|Roosevelt Barnes]] in what some critics described as a \"sucker punch\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Challen|first=Paul|title=The Isiah Thomas Story|year=2004|publisher=ECW Press|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55022-662-2}}</ref> Video replay shown by Knight later showed Barnes had mistakenly thrown the first punch, and that Thomas was merely reacting to this. When the two schools played their second game of the season at Purdue on February 7, 1981, Knight claimed a number of derisive chants were directed at him, his wife, and Indiana University. In response Knight invited Purdue athletic director George King on his weekly television show to discuss the matter, but King declined. Therefore, in place of King, Knight brought onto the show a \"jackass\" (male [[donkey]]) wearing a Purdue hat as a representative of Purdue.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=John|title=Knight Infamous Prankster|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|date=26 March 1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Knight & the Purdue Mascot|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdm4Oi1YRZY|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> The [[1980\u201381 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1980\u201381 Hoosiers]] would go on to win the [[1981 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1981 NCAA National Championship]], the school's fourth national title.\n* On Saturday, February 23, 1985 during a game at Bloomington between Purdue and Indiana, just five minutes into the game, a scramble for a loose ball resulted in a foul call on Indiana's Marty Simmons. Immediately after the resumption of play, a foul was called on Indiana's Daryl Thomas. Knight, irate, insisted the first of the two calls should have been for a [[jump ball]] and ultimately received a [[technical foul]]. Purdue's Steve Reid stepped to the [[free throw line]] to shoot the resulting free throws, but before he could, Knight grabbed a red plastic chair from Indiana's bench and threw it across the floor toward the basket in front of Reid. Knight was charged with second and third technical fouls and was ejected from the game. He apologized for his actions the next day and was given a one-game suspension and two years probation from the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]]. Since the incident, Knight has occasionally joked about throwing the chair by saying that he saw an old lady standing on the opposite sideline and threw her the chair so she could sit down.<ref>{{cite news|title=Knight chair toss resonates 20 years later|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/7008442/|accessdate=6 May 2012|newspaper=NBC Sports|date=21 February 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bobby Knight Throws a Chair|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvRO2GE4x4M|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>\n* Women's groups nationwide were outraged by Knight's comments during an April 1988 interview with [[Connie Chung]] in which he said, \"I think that if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it.\" The same comment had already gotten weatherman [[Tex Antoine]] fired from [[WABC-TV]] in New York twelve years earlier and would ultimately derail the Texas gubernatorial bid of [[Clayton Williams]] two years later.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/big12/2006-11-14-knight-timeline_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Bob Knight's outburst timeline | date=2006-11-14 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> Knight's comment was in reference to an Indiana basketball game in which he felt the referees were making poor calls against the Hoosiers.\n\n===1990s===\n* At a practice leading up to an Indiana\u2013Purdue game in West Lafayette in 1991, Knight unleashed a torrent of expletives and threats designed to motivate his Indiana team.

The bullwhip had been given to Knight as a gift from his team. Several black leaders complained at the racial connotations of the act, given that Cheaney was a black student.<ref>(''Knight: My Story'', pg. 297.)</ref>\n* In January 1993, Knight mentioned the arrival of [[Ivan Renko]] to his team as a trick meant to expose disreputable basketball recruiting experts. Even though Renko was completely fictitious, several recruiting services started listing him as a prospect.\n* Knight was recorded berating an NCAA volunteer at a March 1995 post-game press conference following a 65\u201360 loss to Missouri in the first round of the NCAA tournament held in Boise, Idaho. The volunteer, Rance Pugmire, informed the press that Knight would not be attending the press conference, when in reality, Knight was running a few minutes late and had planned on attending per NCAA rules. Knight was shown saying: \"You've only got two people that are going to tell you I'm not going to be here. One is our SID [Sports Information Director], and the other is me. Who the hell told you I wasn't going to be here? I'd like to know. Do you have any idea who it was? ... Who? ... They were from Indiana, right? ...

Towards the end of the interview, Knight talked about his son, Pat, who had also been dismissed by the university, wanting an opportunity to be a head coach. Schaap, thinking that Knight was finished, attempted to move on to another subject, but Knight insisted on continuing about his son. Schaap repeatedly tried to ask another question when Knight shifted the conversation to Schaap's style of interviewing, notably chastising him about interruptions.

In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists had minimalist album covers featuring [[Xerox art|xeroxed]] black-and-white pictures and/or writing.<ref name=billzebub/> This was partly a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork.<ref name=billzebub/> Many purist black metal artists have continued this style. Black metal album covers are typically dark and tend to be atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example [[Burzum]]'s ''[[Filosofem]]'' and Emperor's ''[[In the Nightside Eclipse]]'') while others are violent, sexually transgressive, sacrilegious, or iconoclastic (for example [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]]'s ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'' and [[Dimmu Borgir]]'s ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'').\n\n=== Production ===\nThe earliest black metal artists had very limited resources, which meant that recordings would often be done in homes or basements,{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} giving their recordings a distinctive \"[[lo-fi]]\" quality. However, even when success allowed access to professional studios, many artists instead chose to continue making lo-fi recordings.<ref name=chronicles/><ref name=murdermusic/> Artists believed that by doing so, they would both stay true to the genre's underground roots as well as make the music sound more \"raw\" or \"cold\".<ref name=murdermusic/> A well-known example of this approach is on the album ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' by [[Darkthrone]], a band who Johnathan Selzer of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine says \"represent the [[DIY]] aspect of black metal.\"<ref name=murdermusic/> In addition, lo-fi production was used to keep black metal inaccessible or unappealing to mainstream music fans and those who are [[Poseur|not committed]].

Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.\n\nAnother major influence on black metal was the Swedish band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (a.k.a. [[Quorthon]]), created \"the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal\".{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=21}} Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the shrieked vocals that came to define black metal.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} The band played in this style on their first four albums: ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'' (1984), ''[[The Return\u2026\u2026]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988).

They developed the style of their 1980s forebears into a distinct genre. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed by Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch of Stigma Diabolicum/Thorns and [[Euronymous|\u00d8ystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth]] of Mayhem.<ref name=billzebub/><ref name=guardian/> Fenriz of Darkthrone described it as being \"derived from Bathory\"<ref name=untilthelight>{{cite video |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |medium=motion picture |publisher=Variance Films}}</ref> and noted that \"those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s\".<ref name=revolver>Kory Grow: [http://www.revolvermag.com/uncategorized/web-exclusive-interview-darkthrones-fenriz-part-2-his-thoughts-on-transilva.html ''WEB-EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: DARKTHRONE'S FENRIZ, PART 2!

Artists were bitterly opposed to Christianity and presented themselves as misanthropic Devil worshippers who wanted to spread terror, hatred and evil.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27, 33, 41}} They professed to be serious in their views and vowed to act on them.

Many, such as Infernus and Gaahl of Gorgoroth, continue to praise the church burnings, with the latter saying \"there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them\".<ref name=sam/> Others, such as Necrobutcher and Kjetil Manheim of Mayhem and [[Abbath]] of Immortal,<ref name=sam /> see the church burnings as having been futile. Manheim claimed that many arsons were \"just people trying to gain acceptance\" within the black metal scene.<ref name=onceuponatime/> [[Watain]] vocalist Erik Danielsson respected the attacks, but said of those responsible: \"the only Christianity they defeated was the last piece of Christianity within themselves.

Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. In May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of four churches, and for possession of 150&nbsp;kg of explosives.

The music is usually slow to mid paced with rare blast beat usage, without any abrupt changes and generally features slowly developing, sometimes repetitive melodies and riffs, which separate it from other black metal styles.

The company originally concentrated on the creation of game [[Porting|ports]] for other studios' games before beginning development of their own software in 1993 with games like ''[[Rock n' Roll Racing]]'' and ''[[The Lost Vikings]]''. In 1994 the company became '''Chaos Studios, Inc.''', then Blizzard Entertainment after being acquired by distributor [[Davidson & Associates]].\n\nShortly thereafter, Blizzard released ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]''. Blizzard created several other video games, including ''[[Warcraft]]'' sequels, the ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'' series, the ''[[StarCraft]]'' series, and in 2004 the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.

CUC then merged with a hotel, real-estate, and car-rental franchiser called [[HFS Corporation]] to form [[Cendant]] in 1997. In 1998 it became apparent that CUC had engaged in accounting fraud for years before the merger. Cendant's stock lost 80% of its value over the next six months in the ensuing widely discussed accounting scandal. The company sold its consumer software operations, Sierra On-line (which included Blizzard) to French publisher [[Havas]] in 1998, the same year Havas was purchased by [[Vivendi]].

Some scholars have suggested that Galileo's agreement was only obtained after some initial resistance. Otherwise, the formal injunction purporting to have been served on him during his meeting with Bellarmine [[#disputedinjunction|(see earlier footnote)]] would have been contrary to the Pope's instructions [[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|(Fantoli. 2005, pp.121, 124)]].</ref>\n\nWhen Galileo later complained of rumours to the effect that he had been forced to abjure and do penance, Bellarmine wrote out a certificate denying the rumors, stating that Galileo had merely been notified of the decree and informed that, as a consequence of it, the Copernican doctrine could not be \"defended or held\".<ref>Blackwell [[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(1991, p.127)]]. Unlike the previously mentioned formal injunction [[#disputedinjunction|(see earlier footnote)]], this milder restriction would have allowed Galileo to continue using and teaching the mathematical content of Copernicus's theory as a purely theoretical device for predicting the apparent motions of the planets.

In August 1590 [[Pope Sixtus V]] decided to place the first volume of the ''Disputationes'' on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]] because Bellarmine argued in it that the Pope is not the temporal ruler of the whole world and that temporal rulers do not derive their authority to rule from God but from the [[consent of the governed]]. However Sixtus died before the revised Index was published, and the next Pope, [[Pope Urban VII|Urban VII]], removed the book from the Index during his brief twelve-day reign.<ref>Galileo, Bellarmine and the Bible, Richard J Blackwell, University of Notre Dame Press 1991 p.30</ref>\n\nIn 1597 he wrote the ''[[Catechism]]'' (''Dottrina cristiana'') in two versions (short and full) which has been translated to 50 [[language]]s, becoming one of the greatest [[bestseller]]s and the official teaching of the [[Catholic Church|Church]] in the 17th to 19th centuries.\n\n===Venetian Interdict===\n{{main|Venetian Interdict}}\nUnder [[Pope Paul V]] (reigned 1605&ndash;1621), a major conflict arose between [[Venice]] and the [[Papacy]]. [[Paolo Sarpi]], as spokesman for the Republic of Venice, protested against the papal [[interdict]], and reasserted the principles of the [[Council of Constance]] and of the [[Council of Basel]], denying the pope's authority in secular matters. Bellarmine wrote three rejoinders to the Venetian theologians, and may have warned Sarpi of an impending murderous attack, when in September 1607, an unfrocked friar and brigand by the name of Rotilio Orlandini planned to kill Sarpi for the sum of 8,000 crowns.<ref>''The Cambridge Modern History, Volume 4: Fra Paolo Sarpi'' (Cambridge University Press 1906), p. 671</ref> Orlandini's plot was discovered, and when he and his accomplices crossed from Papal into Venetian territory they were arrested.<ref>Robertson, Alexander (1893) ''Fra Paolo Sarpi: the Greatest of the Venetians'', London: Sampson, Low, Marston & Co. pp. 114\u2013117</ref>\n\n===Allegiance oath controversy and papal authority===\n{{details|Oath of Allegiance of James I of England}}\nBellarmine also became involved in controversy with King [[James I of England]].

C\u2019est \u00e0 partir donc de cette p\u00e9riode qu\u2019il faudra retrouver certains traits des voyages fictionnels, que j\u2019appelle matrices\u202f, qui hantent encore notre imaginaire, et que l\u2019on retrouve dans les s\u00e9jours Erasmus contemporains\" (Cicchelli Vincenzo, \u00ab Les legs du voyage de formation \u00e0 la Bildung cosmopolite \u00bb, Le T\u00e9l\u00e9maque, 2010/2 (n\u00b0 38), p. 57-70.

In a ''Bildungsroman'', the goal is maturity, and the protagonist achieves it gradually and with difficulty. The genre often features a main conflict between the main character and society. Typically, the values of society are gradually accepted by the protagonist and he/she is ultimately accepted into society\u2014the protagonist's mistakes and disappointments are over. In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.\n\n[[Franco Moretti]] \"argues that the main conflict in the ''Bildungsroman'' is the myth of modernity with its overvaluation of youth and progress as it clashes with the static teleological vision of happiness and reconciliation found in the endings of [[Goethe]]'s ''Wilhelm Meister'' and even [[Jane Austen]]'s ''Pride and Prejudice''\".<ref>Carol Lazzaro-Weis, ''The Female \"Bildungsroman\": Calling It into Question'', NWSA Journal, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1990), pp. 16-34.</ref>\n\nThere are many variations and subgenres of ''Bildungsroman'' that focus on the growth of an individual. An ''Entwicklungsroman'' (\"development novel\") is a story of general growth rather than self-cultivation. An ''Erziehungsroman'' (\"education novel\") focuses on training and formal schooling,<ref>David H. Malone, ''Faculty Development, or Faculty Life as a \"Bildungsroman\"'', Profession (1979), pp. 46-50.</ref> while a ''[[K\u00fcnstlerroman]]'' (\"artist novel\") is about the development of an artist and shows a growth of the self.<ref name=\"Werlock2010p387\">{{cite book |author=Werlock, James P. |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWuyTK_0eBsC&pg=PA387 |title=The Facts on File companion to the American short story |volume=2 |page=387}}</ref> Furthermore, some memoirs and published journals can be regarded as ''Bildungsroman'' although being predominantly factual (e.g. \"[[The Dharma Bums]]\" by [[Jack Kerouac]] or'' [[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'' by [[Che Guevara|Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara]]).<ref>\"[http://www.realteachertutors.com.au/motorcycle-diaries-che-guevara-hsc-english-discovery/ The Motorcycle Diaries by Che Guevara\u2013HSC English Discovery]\", ''Real Teacher Tutors''.

This sense of ''{{lang|la|baccalarius}}'' or ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus}}'' is first attested at the [[University of Paris]] in the 13th century in the system of degrees established under the auspices of [[Pope Gregory IX]] as applied to scholars still ''{{lang|la|in statu pupillari}}''. There were two classes of ''{{lang|la|baccalarii}}'': the ''{{lang|la|baccalarii cursores}}'', theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course, and the ''{{lang|la|baccalarii dispositi}}'', who had completed the course and were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees.<ref>{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Bachelor |volume=3 |page=132 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Victorian era]], the term [[eligible bachelor]] was used in the context of [[upper class]] [[arranged marriage|matchmaking]], denoting a young man who was not only unmarried and eligible for marriage, but also considered \"eligible\" in financial and social terms for the prospective bride under discussion. Also in the Victorian era, the term \"[[confirmed bachelor]]\" denoted a man who was resolute to remain unmarried.\n\nBy the later 19th century, the term \"bachelor\" had acquired the general sense of \"unmarried man\". The expression [[bachelor party]] is recorded 1882. In 1895, a feminine equivalent \"bachelor-girl\" was coined, replaced in US English by \"[[bachelorette]]\" by the mid-1930s. After [[World War II]], this terminology came to be seen as antiquated and has been mostly replaced by the gender-neutral term \"[[single person|single]]\" (first recorded 1964). In England and Wales, the term \"bachelor\" remained the official term used for the purpose of marriage registration until 2005, when it was abolished in favor of \"single.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=R.I.P Bachelors and Spinsters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4141996.stm|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=14 September 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn certain [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Arab]] countries, \"bachelor\" can refer to men who are single as well as immigrant men married to a spouse residing in their country of origin (due to the high added cost of sponsoring a spouse onsite),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/hundreds-of-bachelors-crammed-in-squalid-and-dilapidated-buildings-1.194725 |title=Hundreds of 'bachelors' crammed in squalid and dilapidated buildings |publisher=GulfNews.com |date=2009-05-03 |accessdate=2015-11-25}}</ref> and a colloquial term \"executive bachelor\" is also used in rental and sharing accommodation advertisements to indicate availability to [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] bachelors in particular.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130125101719/http://www.google.com/search?q=executive-bachelor]</ref>\n\n==History==\nBachelors have been subject to [[penal law]]s in many countries, most notably in [[Ancient history|Ancient]] [[Sparta]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].<ref name=\"Baynes 1878, pp. 196\u2013197\"/> At Sparta, men unmarried after a certain age were subject to various penalties ({{lang-grc-gre|\u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1}}, ''atim\u00eda''): they were forbidden to watch women's gymnastics; during the winter, they were made to march naked through the [[agora]] singing a song about their dishonor;<ref name=\"Baynes 1878, pp. 196\u2013197\"/> and they were not provided with the traditional respect due to the elderly.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Lyc''., 15.</ref> Some [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] laws were similar.<ref>Schomann, ''Gr.

These include [[cosmic radiation]] and [[environmental radioactivity]] from such as [[naturally occurring radioactive material]]s including [[radon]] and [[radium]], and man-made [[fallout]] from [[nuclear weapons testing]] and [[nuclear accident]]s.\n\n==Definition==\nBackground radiation is defined by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] as \"Dose or dose rate (or an observed measure related to the dose or dose rate) attributable to all sources other than the one(s) specified.<ref name=\"IAEA Safety Glossary 2007\">IAEA Safety Glossary 2007</ref> So a distinction is made between dose which is already in a location, which is defined here as being \"background\", and the dose due to a deliberately introduced and specified source. This is important where radiation measurements are taken of a specified radiation source, where the existing background may affect this measurement. An example would be measurement of radioactive contamination in a gamma radiation background, which could increase the total reading above that expected from the contamination alone.\n\nHowever, if no radiation source is specified as being of concern, then the total radiation dose measurement at a location is generally called the '''background radiation''', and this is usually the case where an ambient dose rate is measured for environmental purposes.\n\n==Background dose rate examples==\n\nBackground radiation varies with location and time, and the following table gives examples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"background:#ececec;\"\n|+ Average annual human exposure to ionizing radiation in [[millisievert]]s (mSv) per year\n|-\n!

Detectable amounts occur naturally in [[soil]], rocks, water, air, and vegetation, from which it is inhaled and ingested into the body. In addition to this ''internal exposure'', humans also receive ''external exposure'' from radioactive materials that remain outside the body and from cosmic radiation from space. The worldwide average natural [[effective radiation dose|dose]] to humans is about {{convert|2.4|mSv|mrem|abbr=on|lk=on}} per year.<ref name=UNSCEAR2008 /> This is four times the worldwide average artificial radiation exposure, which in 2008 amounted to about {{convert|0.6|mSv|mrem|lk=on}} per year. In some rich countries, like the US and Japan, artificial exposure is, on average, greater than the natural exposure, due to greater access to [[medical imaging]].

This exposure is in most cases of little or no concern to society, but in certain situations the introduction of health protection measures needs to be considered, for example when working with uranium and thorium ores and other Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material ([[NORM]]). These situations have become the focus of greater attention by the Agency in recent years.\" <ref>[http://www-ns.iaea.org/tech-areas/rw-ppss/exposure-to-natural-radiation.asp?s=3 IAEA Safety and Security website retrieved 20/12/15]</ref>\n\n===Terrestrial sources===\n{{main|Environmental radioactivity}}\n'''Terrestrial radiation''', for the purpose of the table above, only includes sources that remain external to the body. The major [[radionuclide]]s of concern are [[potassium]], [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] and their decay products, some of which, like [[radium]] and [[radon]] are intensely radioactive but occur in low concentrations. Most of these sources have been decreasing, due to [[radioactive decay]] since the formation of the Earth, because there is no significant amount currently transported to the Earth. Thus, the present activity on earth from [[uranium-238]] is only half as much as it originally was because of its 4.5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] year half-life, and [[potassium-40]] (half-life 1.25 billion years) is only at about 8% of original activity. But during the time that humans have existed the amount of radiation has decreased very little.\n\nMany shorter half-life (and thus more intensely radioactive) isotopes have not decayed out of the terrestrial environment because of their on-going natural production. Examples of these are [[radium]]-226 (decay product of thorium-230 in decay chain of uranium-238) and radon-222 (a decay product of [[radium]]-226 in said chain).\n\nThorium and uranium (and their daughters) primarily undergo [[alpha decay|alpha]] and [[beta decay]], and aren't easily detectable. However, many of their [[daughter product]]s are strong gamma emitters. Thorium-232 is detectable via a 239&nbsp;keV peak from [[lead-212]], 511, 583 and 2614&nbsp;keV from [[thallium-208]], and 911 and 969&nbsp;keV from [[actinium-228]]. Uranium-238 manifests as 609, 1120, and 1764&nbsp;keV peaks of bismuth-214 (''cf.'' the same peak for atmospheric radon). Potassium-40 is detectable directly via its 1461&nbsp;keV gamma peak.<ref name=\"DetNuc\"/>\n\nThe level over the sea and other large bodies of water tends to be about a tenth of the terrestrial background. Conversely, coastal areas (and areas by the side of fresh water) may have an additional contribution from dispersed sediment.<ref name=\"DetNuc\"/>\n\n===Airborne sources===\nThe biggest source of natural background radiation is airborne [[radon]], a radioactive gas that emanates from the ground. Radon and its [[isotope]]s, parent [[radionuclide]]s, and [[decay product]]s all contribute to an average inhaled dose of 1.26&nbsp;[[Sievert#Common SI usage|mSv/a]] (millisievert [[wikt:per annum|per year]]). Radon is unevenly distributed and varies with weather, such that much higher doses apply to many areas of the world, where it represents a [[Health effects of radon|significant health hazard]]. Concentrations over 500 times the world average have been found inside buildings in Scandinavia, the United States, Iran, and the Czech Republic.<ref name=\"UNSCEAR2006E\">{{cite book|author=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|title=Effects of Ionizing Radiation |date=2006 |publication-date=2008 |publisher=United Nations|location=New York|isbn=978-92-1-142263-4|volume=II|chapter=Annex E: Sources-to-effects assessment for radon in homes and workplaces|url=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2006/09-81160_Report_Annex_E_2006_Web.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> Radon is a decay product of uranium, which is relatively common in the Earth's crust, but more concentrated in ore-bearing rocks scattered around the world. Radon seeps out of these [[ores]] into the atmosphere or into ground water or infiltrates into buildings. It can be inhaled into the lungs, along with its [[decay product]]s, where they will reside for a period of time after exposure.\n\nAlthough radon is naturally occurring, exposure can be enhanced or diminished by human activity, notably house construction. A poorly sealed basement in an otherwise well insulated house can result in the accumulation of radon within the dwelling, exposing its residents to high concentrations. The widespread construction of well insulated and sealed homes in the northern industrialized world has led to radon becoming the primary source of background radiation in some localities in northern North America and Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Basement sealing and suction ventilation reduce exposure. Some building materials, for example [[lightweight concrete]] with [[alum shale]], [[phosphogypsum]] and Italian [[tuff]], may emanate radon if they contain [[radium]] and are porous to gas.<ref name=UNSCEAR2006E />\n\nRadiation exposure from radon is indirect. Radon has a short half-life (4 days) and decays into other solid particulate [[Decay chain#Radium series|radium-series]] radioactive nuclides. These radioactive particles are inhaled and remain lodged in the lungs, causing continued exposure. Radon is thus assumed to be the second leading cause of [[lung cancer]] after [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], and accounts for 15,000 to 22,000 cancer deaths per year in the US alone.<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/radon Radon and Cancer: Questions and Answers \u2013 National Cancer Institute (USA)]</ref>{{better source|date=December 2012}}<!--Radon may also dissolve in groundwater and be ingested, producing a dose to the stomach and the foetus.

The doses are expressed in microsieverts per hour.]]\nThe Earth and all living things on it are constantly bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from [[proton]]s to [[iron]] and larger [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] derived sources outside our [[solar system]]. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an [[air shower (physics)|air shower]] of secondary radiation, including [[X-ray]]s, [[muon]]s, [[proton]]s, [[alpha particle]]s, [[pion]]s, [[electron]]s, and [[neutron]]s. The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies in different parts of the world based largely on the [[geomagnetic field]] and altitude. For example, the city of [[Denver]] in the United States (at 1650 meters elevation) receives a cosmic ray dose roughly twice that of a location at sea level.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://www.units.miamioh.edu/ehso/radiationtraining/backgroundradiation/index.htm\n | title =Background Radiation & Other Sources of Exposure \n | last =\n | first =\n | date =\n | website =Radiation Safety Training\n | publisher =[[Miami University]]\n | access-date =30 September 2016\n | quote = }}</ref> This radiation is much more intense in the upper [[troposphere]], around 10&nbsp;km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for [[airline]] crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment. During their flights airline crews typically get an additional occupational dose between {{cvt|2.2|mSv|mrem}} per year <ref>{{cite web|title=Radiation Exposure During Commercial Airline Flights|accessdate=2011-03-17|url=http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/commercialflights.html}}</ref> and 2.19 mSv/year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/commercialflights.html|title=Radiation exposure during commercial airline flights|author=Health Physics Society|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref>, according to various studies.\n\nSimilarly, cosmic rays cause higher background exposure in [[astronaut]]s than in humans on the surface of Earth. Astronauts in low [[orbit]]s, such as in the [[International Space Station]] or the [[Space Shuttle]], are partially shielded by the [[magnetic field]] of the Earth, but also suffer from the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] which accumulates cosmic rays and results from the Earth's magnetic field. Outside low Earth orbit, as experienced by the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts who traveled to the [[Moon]], this background radiation is much more intense, and represents a considerable obstacle to potential future long term human exploration of the [[moon landing|moon]] or [[Human mission to Mars|Mars]].\n\nCosmic rays also cause [[Nuclear transmutation|elemental transmutation]] in the atmosphere, in which secondary radiation generated by the cosmic rays combines with [[atomic nuclei]] in the atmosphere to generate different [[nuclide]]s. Many so-called [[cosmogenic nuclide]]s can be produced, but probably the most notable is [[carbon-14]], which is produced by interactions with [[nitrogen]] atoms. These cosmogenic nuclides eventually reach the Earth's surface and can be incorporated into living organisms. The production of these nuclides varies slightly with short-term variations in solar cosmic ray flux, but is considered practically constant over long scales of thousands to millions of years. The constant production, incorporation into organisms and relatively short [[half-life]] of carbon-14 are the principles used in [[radiocarbon dating]] of ancient biological materials, such as wooden artifacts or human remains.\n\nThe cosmic radiation at sea level usually manifests as 511&nbsp;keV gamma rays from annihilation of [[positron]]s created by nuclear reactions of high energy particles and gamma rays. At higher altitudes there is also the contribution of continuous [[bremsstrahlung]] spectrum.<ref name=\"DetNuc\"/>\n\n===Food and water===\nTwo of the essential elements that make up the human body, namely potassium and carbon, have radioactive isotopes that add significantly to our background radiation dose.

The flux is dependent on geomagnetic latitude, with a maximum near the magnetic poles. At solar minimums, due to lower solar magnetic field shielding, the flux is about twice as high vs the solar maximum. It also dramatically increases during solar flares.

This includes both offsite \"natural background radiation\" and any medical radiation doses. This value is not typically measured or known from surveys, such that variations in the total dose to individual workers is not known. This can be a significant confounding factor in assessing radiation exposure effects in a population of workers who may have significantly different natural background and medical radiation doses. This is most significant when the occupational doses are very low.\n\nAt an [[IAEA]] conference in 2002, it was recommended that occupational doses below 1\u20132 mSv per year do not warrant regulatory scrutiny.<ref>http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1145_web.pdf</ref>\n\n===Nuclear accidents===\nUnder normal circumstances, nuclear reactors release small amounts of radioactive gases, which cause small radiation exposures to the public.

To the present day, there were two major ''civilian'' accidents \u2013 the [[Chernobyl accident]] and the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] \u2013 which caused substantial contamination. The Chernobyl accident was the only one to cause immediate deaths.\n\nTotal doses from the Chernobyl accident ranged from 10 to 50 mSv over 20 years for the inhabitants of the affected areas, with most of the dose received in the first years after the disaster, and over 100 mSv for [[Liquidator (Chernobyl)|liquidators]].

Radiation treatment for various diseases also accounts for some dose, both in individuals and in those around them.\n\n===Consumer items===\nCigarettes contain polonium-210, originating from the decay products of radon, which stick to tobacco leaves.

This dose is not readily comparable to the radiation protection limits, since the latter deal with whole body doses, while the dose from smoking is delivered to a very small portion of the body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q3137.html|title=Doses from cigarette smoking|author=Dade W. Moeller|work=Health Physics Society|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref>\n\n==Radiation metrology==\nIn a radiation metrology laboratory, '''background radiation''' refers to the measured value from any incidental sources that affect an instrument when a specific radiation source sample is being measured. This background contribution, which is established as a stable value by multiple measurements, usually before and after sample measurement, is subtracted from the rate measured when the sample is being measured.\n\nThis is in accordance with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] definition of background as being \"Dose or dose rate (or an observed measure related to the dose or dose rate) attributable to all sources other than the one(s) specified.<ref name=\"IAEA Safety Glossary 2007\"/>\n\nThe same issue occurs with radiation protection instruments, where a reading from an instrument may be affected by the background radiation. An example of this is a [[scintillation detector]] used for surface contamination monitoring. In an elevated gamma background the scintillator material will be affected by the background gamma, which will add to the reading obtained from any contamination which is being monitored. In extreme cases it will make the instrument unusable as the background swamps the lower level of radiation from the contamination. In such instruments the background can be continually monitored in the \"Ready\" state, and subtracted from any reading obtained when being used in \"Measuring\" mode.\n\nRegular Radiation measurement is carried out at multiple levels.  Government agencies compile radiation readings as part of environmental monitoring mandates, often making the readings available to the public and sometimes in near-real-time.  Collaborative groups and private individuals may also make real-time readings available to the public.  Instruments used for radiation measurement include the [[Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube]] and the [[Scintillation detector]].  The former is usually more compact and affordable and reacts to several radiation types, while the latter is more complex and can detect specific radiation energies and types.  Readings indicate radiation levels from all sources including background, and real-time readings are in general unvalidated, but correlation between independent detectors increases confidence in measured levels.\n\n'''List of near-real-time government radiation measurement sites, employing multiple instrument types:'''\n* Europe and Canada: European Radiological Data Exchange Platform

In the play, he is at first an ally to [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]] (both are generals in the King's army) and they meet the [[Three Witches]] together. After prophesying that Macbeth will become king, the witches tell Banquo that he will not be king himself, but that his descendants will be. Later, Macbeth in his lust for power sees Banquo as a threat and has him murdered by two hired assassins; Banquo's son, [[Fleance]], escapes. Banquo's ghost returns in a later scene, causing Macbeth to react with alarm during a public feast.\n\nShakespeare borrowed the character of Banquo from ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles]]'', a history of Britain published by [[Raphael Holinshed]] in 1587. In ''Chronicles'' Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth in the murder of the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character to please [[James I of England|King James]], who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.\n\n==Sources==\n{{See also|Holinshed's Chronicles}}\n[[Image:Macbeth and Banquo encountering the witches - Holinshed Chronicles.gif|alt=Two men on horseback meet three women.

Why Shakespeare's Banquo is so different from the character described by Holinshed and Boece is not known, though critics have proposed several possible explanations. First among them is the risk associated with portraying the king's ancestor as a murderer and conspirator in the plot to overthrow a rightful king, as well as the author's desire to flatter a powerful patron. But Shakespeare may also simply have altered Banquo's character because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder. There was, however, a need to provide a dramatic contrast to Macbeth; a role that many scholars argue is filled by Banquo.<ref name=\"note\"/> Similarly, when [[Jean de Schelandre]] wrote about Banquo in his ''[[Stuartide]]'' in 1611, he also changed the character by portraying him as a noble and honourable man\u2014the critic D. W. Maskell describes him as \"...Schelandre's paragon of valour and virtue\"\u2014probably for reasons similar to Shakespeare's.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Transformation of History into Epic: The \"Stuartide\" (1611) of Jean de Schelandre |last=Maskell |first=D.

Banquo's loyalty to Macbeth, rather than [[Malcolm (Macbeth)|Malcolm]], after Duncan's death makes him a passive accomplice in the coup: Malcolm, as Prince of Cumberland, is the rightful heir to the throne and Macbeth a usurper. Daniel Amneus argued that ''Macbeth'' as it survives is a revision of an earlier play, in which Duncan granted Macbeth not only the title of Thane of Cawdor, but the \"greater honor\"<ref>[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T13.html#104 ''Macbeth'', Act 1, Scene 3, line 104.]</ref> of Prince of Cumberland (i.e. heir to the throne of Scotland).

In the next scene, Banquo and Macbeth, returning from the battle together, encounter the [[Three Witches]], who predict that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor, and then king. Banquo, sceptical of the witches, challenges them to predict his own future, and they foretell that Banquo will never himself take the throne, but will beget a line of kings. Banquo remains sceptical after the encounter, wondering aloud if evil can ever speak the truth. He warns Macbeth that evil will offer men a small, hopeful truth only to catch them in a deadly trap.<ref>[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T13.html ''Macbeth.''

Macbeth, for example, eagerly accepts the Three Witches' prophecy as true and seeks to help it along. Banquo, on the other hand, doubts the prophecies and the intentions of these seemingly evil creatures. Whereas Macbeth places his hope in the prediction that he will be king, Banquo argues that evil only offers gifts that lead to destruction. Banquo steadily resists the temptations of evil within the play, praying to heaven for help, while Macbeth seeks darkness, and prays that evil powers will aid him. This is visible in act two; after Banquo sees Duncan to bed, he says: \"There's husbandry in heaven, / Their candles are all out\".<ref name=\"shakespeare-navigators.com\">[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T21.html#4 ''Macbeth'', Act 2, Scene 1, lines 4\u20135.]</ref> This premonition of the coming darkness in association with Macbeth's murders is repeated just before Banquo is killed: \"it will be rain to-night\",<ref>[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T33.html#16 ''Macbeth'', Act 3, Scene 3, line 16.]</ref> Banquo tells his son Fleance.<ref>{{cite book |last=Watson |first=Robert N. |chapter=\"Thriftless Ambition,\" Foolish Wishes, and the Tragedy of Macbeth |title=William Shakespeare's Macbeth |editor1-first=Harold |editor1-last=Bloom |series=Modern Critical Interpretations |location=New York |publisher=Chelsea House Publishers |year=1987 |isbn=0-87754-930-3 |pages=133\u201368}}</ref>\n\nBanquo's status as a contrast to Macbeth makes for some tense moments in the play. In act two, scene one, Banquo meets his son Fleance and asks him to take both his sword and his dagger (\"Hold, take my sword&nbsp;... Take thee that too\"<ref name=\"shakespeare-navigators.com\"/>). He also explains that he has been having trouble sleeping due to \"cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!\"<ref>[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T21.html#8 ''Macbeth'', Act 2, Scene 1, lines 8\u20139.]</ref> On Macbeth's approach, he demands the sword returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king as Macbeth's accomplice to take the throne for his own family, as the Three Witches prophesied to him. In this reading, his good nature is so revolted by these thoughts that he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure they do not come true, but is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands them back.<ref>{{cite journal |title= A Note on \"Macbeth,\" Act II, Scene 1 |last=Westbrook |first=Perry D. |journal=[[College English]] |date=January 1946 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=219\u201320 |doi=10.2307/371197 |publisher=[[National Council of Teachers of English]]}}</ref> Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams have less to do with killing the king and more to do with Macbeth. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night. Then, when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had dreams about Macbeth's deeds, takes back his sword as a precaution in this case.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Banquo, Loyal Subject |last=Henneberger |first=Olive |journal=College English |date=October 1946 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=18\u201322 |doi=10.2307/370443 |publisher=National Council of Teachers of English}}</ref>\n\nMacbeth eventually sees that Banquo can no longer be trusted to aid him in his evil, and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne. Thus he has him murdered.<ref name=\"note\"/> Banquo's ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force, in this case to Macbeth's impending death. His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calderwood |first=James L. |title=If It Were Done: Macbeth and Tragic Action |location=Amherst |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Press]] |year=1986 |pages=96\u20137 |isbn=978-0-87023-534-4}}</ref>\n\n===Ghost scenes===\nWhen Macbeth returns to the witches later in the play, they show him an apparition of the murdered Banquo, along with eight of his descendants. The scene carries deep significance: King James, on the throne when ''Macbeth'' was written, was believed to be separated from Banquo by nine generations. What Shakespeare writes here thus amounts to a strong support of James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, a very real fulfilment of the witches' prophecy to Banquo that his sons would take the throne.<ref>{{cite journal |title=\"Macbeth\": King James's Play |last=Williams |first=George Walton |journal=[[South Atlantic Review]] |date=May 1982 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=12\u201321 |doi=10.2307/3199207}}</ref> This apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Apparitions in Macbeth, Part II |last=Crawford |first=A.

Banquo's triumph over death appears symbolically, insofar as he literally takes Macbeth's seat during the feast. Shocked, Macbeth uses words appropriate to the metaphor of usurpation, describing Banquo as \"crowned\" with wounds. The spirit drains Macbeth's manhood along with the blood from his cheeks; as soon as Banquo's form vanishes, Macbeth announces: \"Why, so; being gone, / I am a man again.\"<ref>[http://www.clicknotes.com/macbeth/T34.html#106 ''Macbeth'', Act 3, Scene 4, lines 106\u2013107.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603033725/http://www.clicknotes.com/macbeth/T34.html |date=3 June 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"Calder\">{{cite book |last=Calderwood |first=James L. |title=If It Were Done: Macbeth and Tragic Action |location=Amherst |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Press]] |year=1986 |pages=126\u20139 |isbn=978-0-87023-534-4}}</ref>\n\nLike the vision of Banquo's lineage, the banquet scene has also been the subject of criticism. Critics have questioned whether not one, but perhaps two ghosts appear in this scene: Banquo and Duncan. Scholars arguing that Duncan attends the banquet state that Macbeth's lines to the Ghost could apply equally well to the slain king. \"Thou canst not say I did it\", for example, can mean that Macbeth is not the man who actually killed Banquo, or it can mean that Duncan, who was asleep when Macbeth killed him, cannot claim to have seen his killer. To add to the confusion, some lines Macbeth directs to the ghost, such as \"Thy bones are marrowless\",<ref>[http://www.clicknotes.com/macbeth/T34.html#94 ''Macbeth'', Act 3, Scene 4, line 91.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603033725/http://www.clicknotes.com/macbeth/T34.html |date=3 June 2010 }}</ref> cannot rightly be said of Banquo, who has only recently died.<ref name=\"Furness\">{{cite book |title=Macbeth |editor1-last=Furness |editor1-first=Horace Howard |editor1-link=Horace Howard Furness |publisher=Classic Books |year=2007 |isbn=0-7426-5283-1 |pages=167\u20139}}</ref>\n\nScholars debate whether Macbeth's vision of Banquo is real or a hallucination. Macbeth had already seen a hallucination before murdering Duncan: a knife hovering in the air. Several performances of the play have even ignored the stage direction to have the Ghost of Banquo enter at all, heightening the sense that Macbeth is growing mad, since the audience cannot see what he claims to see. Scholars opposing this view claim that while the dagger is unusual, ghosts of murdered victims are more believable, having a basis in the audience's superstitions. Spirits in other Shakespeare plays\u2014notably ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]''\u2014exist in ambiguous forms, occasionally even calling into question their own presence.<ref name=\"Calder\"/><ref name=\"Furness\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Bradley |first=A.

Bradley |title=Shakespearean Tragedy |location=Boston |publisher=Adamant Media |year=2003 |isbn=1-4212-0849-0 |pages=492\u20133}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of a character being confronted at a triumphant feast with a reminder of their downfall is not unique to Shakespeare and may originate from the [[Belshazzar's feast]] episode of the Bible. The term 'ghost at the feast' has entered popular culture, and is often used as a metaphor for a subject a person would rather avoid considering, or (considering the general plot of ''Macbeth'') a reminder of a person's unpleasant past or likely future.\n\n==Performances and interpretations==\n[[File:Macbeth-07-Lee.jpg|left|300px|thumb|[[Canada Lee]] as Banquo in the [[Federal Theatre Project]] production of ''[[Voodoo Macbeth|Macbeth]]'' (1936)]]\nBanquo's role, especially in the banquet ghost scene, has been subject to a variety of interpretations and mediums. Shakespeare's text states: \"Enter Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeth's place.\"<ref>[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T34.html#36 ''Macbeth'', Act 3, Scene 4.]</ref> Several television versions have altered this slightly, having Banquo appear suddenly in the chair, rather than walking onstage and into it. Special effects and camera tricks also allow producers to make the ghost disappear and reappear, highlighting the fact that ''only'' Macbeth can see it.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Imperial Theme: \"Macbeth\" on Television |last=Jones |first=Claude E.  |journal=The Quarterly of Film Radio and television |date=April 1955 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=292\u20138 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |doi=10.1525/fq.1955.9.3.04a00070}}</ref>\n\nStage directors, unaided by post-production effects and camera tricks, have used other methods to depict the ghost. In the late 19th century, elaborate productions of the play staged by [[Henry Irving]] employed a wide variety of approaches for this task. In 1877 a green silhouette was used to create a ghostlike image; ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear in the middle of the scene, and then again from the midst of the audience. In 1895 a shaft of blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo's spirit. In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play (Banquo and Macbeth were told of their future through [[palmistry]]); he used Macbeth's shadow as the ghost.<ref name=\"Barnet\">{{cite book |last=Barnet |first=Sylvan |chapter=''Macbeth'' on Stage and Screen |title=Macbeth |editor1-first=Sylvan |editor1-last=Barnet |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1963 |isbn=0-451-52444-6 |pages=186\u2013200}}</ref> In 1936 [[Orson Welles]] directed the [[Federal Theatre Project]] [[Voodoo Macbeth|production of the play]], with an African-American cast that included [[Canada Lee]] in the role of Banquo.<ref name=\"Barnet\"/>\n\nFilm adaptations have approached Banquo's character in a variety of ways. [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1957 adaptation ''[[Throne of Blood]]'' makes the character into Capitan Miki (played by [[Minoru Chiaki]]), slain by Macbeth's equivalent (Captain Washizu) when his wife explains that she is with child. News of Miki's death does not reach Washizu until after he has seen the ghost in the banquet scene.

So Parliament initiated two actions. The [[Self-denying Ordinance]], with the notable exception of [[Oliver Cromwell]], forbade members of parliament from serving as officers in the Parliamentary armies. This created a distinction between the civilians in Parliament, who tended to be Presbyterian and conciliatory to the Royalists in nature, and a corps of professional officers, who tended to Independent politics, to whom they reported. The second action was legislation for the creation of a Parliamentary-funded army, commanded by Lord General [[Thomas Fairfax]], which became known as the [[New Model Army]] (originally new-modelled Army).{{sfn|Rogers|1968|pp=207\u2013211}}\n\nWhile this proved to be a war winning formula, the New Model Army, being organized and politically active, went on to dominate the politics of the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] and by 1660 was widely disliked. The New Model Army was paid off and disbanded at the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660. For many decades the excesses of the New Model Army under [[the Protectorate]] of Oliver Cromwell was a horror story and the Whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army.<ref>Lord Macaulay ''The History of England from the accession of James the Second'' (C.H.

In 1694, a board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of English, Irish and Scots regiments serving in the Netherlands; the regiment which became known as the [[Scots Greys]] were designated the 4th Dragoons because there were three English regiments raised prior to 1688, when the Scots Greys were first placed in the English establishment. In 1713, when a new board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of several regiments, the seniority of the Scots Greys was reassessed and based on their June 1685 entry into England.

The campaign of English republican Protector [[Oliver Cromwell]] involved uncompromising treatment of the Irish towns (most notably [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]]) which supported the Royalists during the [[English Civil War]]. The English Army (and the subsequent British Army) remained in Ireland primarily to suppress Irish revolts or disorder.  In addition to its conflict with Irish nationalists, it was faced with the prospect of battling Anglo-Irish and [[Ulster-Scots|Ulster Scots]] in Ireland who were angered by unfavourable taxation of Irish produce imported into Britain.

The army's structure is broadly similar to the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]], in that the four-star (general-equivalent) field commands have been eliminated. Under the Army 2020 Command structure, the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] is in charge of Army Headquarters. There are four lieutenant-general posts in Army headquarters: the [[Deputy Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Deputy Chief of the General Staff]], the [[Commander Field Army]], the Commander [[Home Command (British Army)|Home Command]] and the Commander [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482984/20151201-FOI201510480_76137_CFA_Restructure_ArmySec.pdf|title=Freedom of Information Act answer from Army Headquarters|publisher=Army Headquarters|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref> Army Headquarters is responsible for providing forces at operational readiness for employment by the [[Permanent Joint Headquarters]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe command structure is hierarchical, with [[Division (military)|divisions]] and [[brigade]]s controlling groups of units. Major units are [[regiment]]/[[battalion]]-sized, and minor units are [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized units (or [[platoons]]). All units are Regular (full-time) or [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] (part-time).<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nNaming conventions of units differ for historical reasons, creating some confusion; the term \"battalion\" in the infantry is synonymous with a cavalry, artillery or engineer regiment, and the infantry \"company\" is synonymous with an engineer or cavalry squadron and an artillery battery. The table below illustrates the different names for equivalent units.<ref name=\"SAS\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Infantry\n!Cavalry\n!Artillery\n!Engineers\n|-\n|Regiment (two or more battalions grouped for administration)\n|No equivalent\n|No equivalent\n|No equivalent\n|-\n|Battalion \n|Regiment\n|Regiment\n|Regiment\n|-\n|Company\n|Squadron\n|Battery\n|Squadron\n|-\n|Platoon\n|Troop\n|Troop\n|Troop\n|}\nAdding to the confusion is the tendency of units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures. Although the [[Royal Artillery]] consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] and [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] are not [[corps]]-sized, but corps in this instance are administrative branches consisting of several battalions or regiments.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Operational structure ===\n{{See also|Administrative structure of the field forces of the British Army}}\nThe field forces of the British Army after the [[Army 2020]] reforms are organised in garrison as:\n* Reaction forces: A modified [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] and an armoured division ([[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]]) of three armoured infantry brigades (1st, 12th and 20th Armoured Infantry Brigades).

An example of a battlegroup in the Reactive Force (e.g. the 1st Brigade) would be two companies of armoured infantry (e.g. from the 1st Battalion of the Mercian Regiment), one squadron of heavy armour (e.g. A Squadron of the Royal Tank Regiment), a company of engineers (e.g. B Company of the 22nd Engineer Regiment), a battery of artillery (e.g. D Battery of the 1st Regiment of the Royal Horse Artillery) and smaller attachments from medical, logistic and intelligence units. Typically organised and commanded by a battlegroup headquarters and named after the unit which provided the most combat units, in this example it would be the 1 Mercian Battlegroup). This creates a self-sustaining mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, typically 600 to 1,000 soldiers commanded by a lieutenant colonel.<ref name=\"SAS\" />\n\nThe table below demonstrates how three or four battlegroups make up a [[brigade]] and three or four brigades make up a [[Division (military)|division.]]  A division is currently the largest unit the British Army is capable of deploying independently, although it could be grouped with three or four other divisions from a multi-national coalition to form a [[corps]].<ref name=\"SAS\">{{cite web | title = British Army Formation & Structure | publisher = WhoDaresWins.com | year = 2011 | url = http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-formation-structure-setup.html | accessdate = 15 April 2011}}\n</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Type of unit\n![[Division (military)|Division]]\n![[Brigade]]\n![[Battlegroup (army)|Battlegroup]]\n![[Battalion]], Regiment\n![[Company (military unit)|Company]], [[Squadron (cavalry)|Squadron]]\n![[Platoon]], [[Troop]]\n![[Section (military unit)|Section]]\n![[Fireteam|Fire Team]]\n|-\n!Contains\n|3 brigades\n|3\u20134 battalions (battlegroups)\n|Combined arms unit\n|4\u20136 companies\n|3 platoons\n|3 sections\n|2 fire teams\n|4 individuals\n|-\n!Personnel\n|15,000\n|5,000\n|700\u20131,000\n|720\n|120\n|30\n|8\u201310\n|4\n|-\n!Commanded by\n|[[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Maj-Gen]]\n|[[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brig]]\n|[[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lt Col]]\n|[[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lt Col]]\n|[[Major (United Kingdom)|Maj]]\n|[[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Capt]], [[Lieutenant|Lt]] or [[2nd Lieutenant#United Kingdom and Commonwealth|2nd Lt]]\n|[[Corporal#United Kingdom|Cpl]]\n|[[Chosen man|LCpl]]\n|}\n\n==== Special forces ====\n[[File:uk-sas.svg|upright|thumb|alt=Emblem of a winged sword with the motto, \"Who dares, wins\"|SAS [[cap badge]]]]\nThe British Army contributes two of the three [[special forces]] formations to the [[United Kingdom Special Forces]] directorate: the [[Special Air Service#22 SAS Regiment|Special Air Service]] and [[Special Reconnaissance Regiment]]s.<ref name=\"PPUK\">{{cite web|accessdate=26 March 2010|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|title=Special Reconnaissance Regiment|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050405/wmstext/50405m01.htm#50405m01.html_sbhd5}}</ref> The [[Special Air Service]] consists of one regular-army and two reserve regiments.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=26 March 2010 |publisher=[[Defence Analytical Services Agency]] |title=UK Defence Statistics 2009 |url=http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/UK-defence-statistics-compendium/2009/2009.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201230645/http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/UK-defence-statistics-compendium/2009/2009.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2014 }}</ref> The regular regiment, 22 SAS, has its headquarters and depot in [[Hereford]] and consists of five squadrons (A, B, D, G and Reserve) and a training wing.<ref>{{harvnb|Fremont-Barnes|2009|p=62}}</ref> 22 SAS is supported by two reserve regiments: [[Artists Rifles|21 SAS]] and 23 SAS\u2014collectively, the Special Air Service (Reserve) (SAS [R])\u2014under the command of the [[1st Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade]].<ref>Army Briefing Note 120/14, Newly formed Force Troops Command Specialist Brigades: \"It commands all of the Army's Intelligence, Surveillance and Electronic Warfare assets, and is made up of units specifically from the former 1 Military Intelligence Brigade and 1 Artillery Brigade, as well as 14 Signal Regiment, 21 and 23 SAS\u00ae.\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Special Reconnaissance Regiment]] (SRR), formed in 2005, performs close reconnaissance and special surveillance tasks.<ref name=\"PPUK\"/> The [[Special Forces Support Group]], under the operational control of the Director of Special Forces, provides operational manoeuvring support to the United Kingdom Special Forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060420/wmstext/60420m01.htm|title=Special Forces Support Group|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== {{anchor|Locally raised units of British Overseas Territories}}Local units ====\n[[File:1939 Dominion and Colonial Regiments.jpg|thumb|left|1939 Dominion and Colonial Regiments]]\n[[File:1945 Order of Precedence of the British Army.jpg|thumb|1945 Order of Precedence of the British Army]]\nThe British Army historically included many units from what are now separate [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] ''realms''. When the [[English Empire]] was established in North America, Bermuda, and the West Indies in the early Seventeenth Century there was no standing English Army, only the Militia, and this was extended to the colonies. Colonial Militias defended colonies single-handedly at first against Indigenous peoples and European competitors. Once the standing English Army, later the British Army, came into existence, the colonial Militias fought side-by-side with it in a number of wars, including the [[Seven Years' War]]. Some of the colonial Militias rebelled during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. Militia fought alongside the regular British Army (and Native allies) in defending British North America from their former countrymen during the [[War of 1812|American War of 1812]]. With the growth of the Empire around the world, ''Non-European'' (i.e., non-white, except for officers) units were recruited in many colonies and [[protectorate]]s, but most were deemed auxiliaries and not part of the British Army. The [[West India Regiment]]s were an exception, as they were fully incorporated into the British Army, but were kept outside of Europe and non-whites were denied commissions. Locally raised units in strategically-located colonies (including Bermuda, Gibraltar, Malta) and the Channel Islands were generally more fully integrated into the British Army as evident from their appearances in British Army Lists, unlike units such as [[King's African Rifles]]. The larger colonies (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, et cet.) mostly achieved [[Dominion|Commonwealth Dominion]] status before or after the First World War and were granted granted full legislative independence in 1931. While remaining within the British Empire, this placed their governments on a par with the British Government, and hence their military units comprised separate armies (e.g. the [[Australian Army]]), although Canada retained the term Militia for its military forces until the Second World War. From the 1940s, these Dominions and many colonies chose full independence, usually becoming [[Commonwealth realm]]s (as member states of the Commonwealth are known today).<ref>{{cite web | title=Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 | work=National Archives of Australia: Documenting a Democracy | url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 | accessdate=8 August 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050716075624/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 | archivedate=16 July 2005 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{citation| url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding+Canadian+throne/7651371/story.html| last=Bowden| first=James| first2=Philippe| last2=Lagass\u00e9| title=Succeeding to the Canadian throne| date=6 December 2012| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| accessdate=6 December 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110062651/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding%2BCanadian%2Bthrone/7651371/story.html| archivedate=10 January 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nUnits raised in [[Self-governing colony|self-governing]] and [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]] that are part of the British Realm remain under UK control.

Savage]] (1954). The adjective ''Bayesian'' itself dates to the 1950s;  the derived ''Bayesianism'', ''neo-Bayesianism'' is of 1960s coinage.<ref>\n\"The works of [[Abraham Wald|Wald]], ''Statistical Decision Functions'' (1950) and [[Leonard J.

A [[Dutch book]] is made when a clever gambler places a set of bets that guarantee a profit, no matter what the outcome of the bets. If a [[bookmaker]] follows the rules of the Bayesian calculus in the construction of his odds, a Dutch book cannot be made.\n\nHowever, [[Ian Hacking]] noted that traditional Dutch book arguments did not specify Bayesian updating: they left open the possibility that non-Bayesian updating rules could avoid Dutch books. For example, [[Ian Hacking|Hacking]] writes<ref>Hacking (1967, Section 3, page 316), Hacking (1988, page 124)</ref> \"And neither the Dutch book argument, nor any other in the personalist arsenal of proofs of the probability axioms, entails the dynamic assumption. Not one entails Bayesianism. So the personalist requires the dynamic assumption to be Bayesian.

Salt could lose its savour.\"\n\nIn fact, there are non-Bayesian updating rules that also avoid Dutch books (as discussed in the literature on \"[[probability kinematics]]\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skyrms|first=Brian|date=1987-01-01|title=Dynamic Coherence and Probability Kinematics|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=54|issue=1|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1086/289350|jstor=187470}}</ref> following the publication of [[Richard Jeffrey|Richard C.

Johann Pfanzagl completed the ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' by providing an axiomatization of subjective probability and utility, a task left uncompleted by von Neumann and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]: their original theory supposed that all the agents had the same probability distribution, as a convenience.<ref>Pfanzagl (1967, 1968)</ref> Pfanzagl's axiomatization was endorsed by Oskar Morgenstern: \"Von Neumann and I have anticipated...[the question whether probabilities] might, perhaps more typically, be subjective and have stated specifically that in the latter case axioms could be found from which could derive the desired numerical utility together with a number for the probabilities (cf. p. 19 of The [[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]).

To meet the needs of science and of human limitations, Bayesian statisticians have developed \"objective\" methods for specifying prior probabilities.\n\nIndeed, some Bayesians have argued the prior state of knowledge defines ''the'' (unique) prior probability-distribution for \"regular\" statistical problems; cf. [[well-posed problem]]s. Finding the right method for constructing such \"objective\" priors (for appropriate classes of regular problems) has been the quest of statistical theorists from Laplace to [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Harold Jeffreys]], and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]]. These theorists and their successors have suggested several methods for constructing \"objective\" priors (Unfortunately, it is not clear how to assess the relative \"objectivity\" of the priors proposed under these methods):\n* [[principle of maximum entropy|Maximum entropy]]\n* [[Haar measure|Transformation group analysis]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9-Miguel Bernardo|Reference analysis]]\n\nEach of these methods contributes useful priors for \"regular\" one-parameter problems, and each prior can handle some challenging [[statistical model]]s (with \"irregularity\" or several parameters). Each of these methods has been useful in Bayesian practice. Indeed, methods for constructing \"objective\" (alternatively, \"default\" or \"ignorance\") priors have been developed by avowed subjective (or \"personal\") Bayesians like [[James Berger (statistician)|James Berger]] ([[Duke University]]) and [[Jos\u00e9-Miguel Bernardo]] ([[University of Valencia|Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia]]), simply because such priors are needed for Bayesian practice, particularly in science.<ref name=\"refa\">Bernardo, J.

As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to improve the league's commercial viability and promote its popularity, and he helped make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and preeminent sports attraction in the United States (US). He was posthumously inducted into the charter class of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nBell played football at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where as [[quarterback]], he led his team to an appearance in the [[1917 Rose Bowl]]. After being drafted into the US Army during World War I, he returned to complete his collegiate career at Penn and went on to become an assistant football coach with the [[Penn Quakers football|Quakers]] in the 1920s. During the [[Great Depression]], he was an assistant coach for the [[Temple Owls football|Temple Owls]] and a co-founder and co-owner of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].\n\nWith the Eagles, Bell led the way in cooperating with the other NFL owners to establish the [[National Football League Draft]] in order to afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available players. He subsequently became sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the team and bought a share in the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. During [[World War II]], Bell astutely argued against the league suspending operations until the war's conclusion.\n\nAfter the war, he was elected NFL commissioner and sold his ownership in the Steelers. As commissioner, he implemented a proactive anti-gambling policy, negotiated a merger with the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), and unilaterally crafted the entire league schedule with an emphasis on enhancing the dramatic effect of late-season matches. During the [[Golden Age of Television]], he tailored the game's rules to strengthen its appeal to mass media and enforced a policy of blacking out local broadcasts of home contests to safeguard ticket receipts. Amid criticism from franchise owners and under pressure from [[United States Congress|Congress]], he unilaterally recognized the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] and facilitated in the development of the first pension plan for the players. He survived to oversee the [[1958 NFL Championship Game|\"Greatest Game Ever Played\"]] and to envision what the league would become in the future.\n\n==Early life (1895\u20131932)==\nBell was born de Benneville Bell,<ref>Didinger with Lyons: 6; cf.

He is the son of Jayne (Quinlan), of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, and John George Costas, an electrical engineer of [[Greek American|Greek]] descent. His father's ancestry can be traced back to the island of [[Kalymnos]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] in Greece.  As Costas stated on [[Ken Burns]]' [[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]], he had a very poor relationship with his father. Costas graduated from [[Commack School District|Commack High School South]] and attended [[Syracuse University]] in [[Syracuse, New York]].\n\n==Broadcasting career==\n\n===Early career===\nIn 1973, Costas began his professional career at [[WSYR-TV|WSYR TV]] and [[WSYR (AM)|radio]] in Syracuse, while still completing his communications degree at the [[S.I.

His sportscasting career began while attending Syracuse University, serving as an announcer for the [[Syracuse Blazers]] minor-league hockey team playing in the [[Eastern Hockey League]] and [[North American Hockey League]].\n\nAfter graduating in 1974 at the age of 22, Costas went to [[KMOX]] radio in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], calling play-by-play for the [[Spirits of St. Louis]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] in 1974. He was a prominent contributor to the ABA book ''[[Loose Balls]]: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association''. He is extensively quoted on many topics.

One of his most memorable broadcasts occurred on June 23, 1984 (in what would go down in baseball lore as \"[[The Sandberg Game]]\").<ref name=\"chicagocubsonline1\">{{cite web|author=Neil on June 23, 2009 |url=http://chicagocubsonline.com/archives/2009/06/1984cubs_2.php |title=Looking Back at '84: The Sandberg Game |publisher=ChicagoCubsOnline.com |date= June 23, 2009 |accessdate= July 16, 2012}}</ref> Costas, along with Tony Kubek, was calling the Saturday baseball ''[[Major League Baseball on NBC|Game of the Week]]'' from Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]]. The game between the [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] and [[1984 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in particular was cited for putting [[Ryne Sandberg]] (as well as the [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|1984 Cubs]] in general, who would go on to make their first postseason appearance since [[1945 Chicago Cubs season|1945]]) \"on the map\". In the ninth inning, the Cubs, trailing 9\u20138, faced the premier relief pitcher of the time, [[Bruce Sutter]]. Sandberg, then not known for his power, slugged a home run to left field against the Cardinals' ace closer.<ref name=\"chicagocubsonline1\" /> Despite this dramatic act, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. Sandberg came up again in the tenth inning, facing a determined Sutter with one man on base. Sandberg then shocked the national audience by hitting a second home run, even farther into the left field bleachers, to tie the game again.<ref name=\"chicagocubsonline1\" /> The Cubs went on to win in the 11th inning.<ref>[http://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2008/2/9/5390/94355 The Top 20 Cub HR Of All Time \u2013 #4 Ryne Sandberg 6/23/1984 \u2013 Bleed Cubbie Blue<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> When Sandberg hit that second home run, Costas said, ''\"Do you believe it?!\"'' The Cardinals' [[Willie McGee]] hit for the cycle in the same game.\n\nWhile hosting Game 4 of the [[1988 World Series]] between the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] on [[NBC]], Costas angered many members of the Dodgers (especially the team's manager, [[Tommy Lasorda]]) by commenting before the start of the game that the Dodgers quite possibly were about to put up the weakest-hitting lineup in World Series history.<ref>{{cite news|author= Ostler, Scott |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-20/sports/sp-5478_1_dodger-lineup |title=This Is One Incredible Stunt They're Pulling Off | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= October 20, 1988|accessdate= July 31, 2012}}</ref> That comment ironically fired up the Dodgers' competitive spirit. Later (while being interviewed by NBC's [[Marv Albert]]), after the Dodgers had won Game 4 (en route to a 4\u20131 series victory), Lasorda sarcastically suggested the MVP of the 1988 World Series should be Bob Costas.\n\nBesides calling the [[1989 American League Championship Series]] for NBC, Costas also filled-in for a suddenly ill [[Vin Scully]], who had come down with [[laryngitis]], for Game 2 of the [[1989 National League Championship Series]] alongside [[Tom Seaver]]. Game 2 of the NLCS took place on Thursday, October 5, which was an off day for the ALCS. NBC then decided to fly Costas from Toronto to Chicago to substitute for Scully on Thursday night. Afterward, Costas flew back to Toronto, where he resumed work on the ALCS the next night.\n\nCostas anchored NBC's pre- and post-game shows for NFL broadcasts and the pre and post-game shows for numerous World Series and [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]s during the 1980s (the first being for the [[1982 World Series]]). Costas did not get a shot at doing play-by-play (as the games on NBC were previously called by Vin Scully) for an All-Star Game until [[1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1994]] and a World Series until [[1995 World Series|1995]] (when NBC split the coverage with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] under \"[[The Baseball Network]]\" umbrella), when NBC regained Major League Baseball rights after a four-year hiatus (when the broadcast network television contract moved over to [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Costas Prepares For (long) Offseason|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-10-07/sports/8902030046_1_bob-costas-broadcast-baseball-baseball-game|author=Jim Sarni|newspaper=Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=October 7, 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Du Brow|first=Rick|date= |title=NBC's Team Player Has His Eye on the Ball : Sportscasting: With CBS' surprise sacking of Brent Musburger, Bob Costas would seem the obvious replacement\u2014but he's sticking with his baseball-less network.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-05/entertainment/ca-1120_1_bob-costas|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location= |access-date= }}</ref> exclusively). It was not until [[1997 World Series|1997]] when Costas finally got to do play-by-play for a World Series from start to finish. Costas ended up winning a [[Sports Emmy Award]] for [[Outstanding Sports Personality, Play-by-Play]].\n\nIn [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]], Costas teamed with his then-[[NBC]] colleague Joe Morgan to call two weekday night telecasts for [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]]. The first was on [[Wednesday Night Baseball|Wednesday]], August 25 with [[1999 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] playing against the [[1999 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]]. The second was on Tuesday, September 21 with the [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] playing against the [[1999 New York Mets season|New York Mets]].\n\n====NASCAR====\nIn November 2017, it was announced that Costas would alongside [[Krista Voda]], co-anchor [[NASCAR on NBC|NBC]]'s pre-race coverage leading into the [[2017 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR Cup Series]] [[Ford EcoBoost 400|finale]] from [[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2017/11/bob-costas-nascar-danica-espn-goodell/|title= Extra Points: Costas, Danica, ESPN, NFL Commish|last= |first= |date=November 18, 2017|website=Sports Media Watch|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> In addition to hosting pre-race coverage, Costas would conduct a live interview with incoming NBC broadcaster [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], who was running his final race.\n\n====National Basketball Association====\nWhen NBC gained the NBA network contract from [[NBA on CBS|CBS]] in [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990]], Costas hosted the telecasts and was teamed in the studio with ex-[[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] coach [[Pat Riley]]. He also hosted the studio program ''[[NBA Showtime|Showtime]]'' and did play-by-play for the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game|1991 All-Star Game]]. In [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997]], Costas began a three-year stint as the lead play-by-play man for ''[[NBA on NBC|The NBA on NBC]]''. NBC enlisted Costas' services after they were forced to (temporarily) remove [[Marv Albert]] from their broadcasts due to lingering personal and legal problems at the time. Costas teamed with [[Isiah Thomas]] and [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] for NBA telecasts from [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997]] to [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|2000]]. He stepped aside following the [[2000 NBA Finals]] in favor of a returning Albert. While this, in essence, ended his active role on the ''NBA on NBC'' program (by this point, [[Hannah Storm]] and briefly, [[Ahmad Rash\u0101d]] had replaced Costas on studio anchoring duties), Costas would return to do play-by-play for selected playoff games. He returned to call some games of the [[2002 NBA Playoffs]] after Albert was injured in a car accident two days before the playoffs. Costas also co-anchored (with [[Hannah Storm]]) NBC's NBA Finals coverage in [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], which was their last to-date (before the NBA's network television contract moved to [[NBA on ABC|ABC]]).\n\n====Professional football====\nNBC Sports allowed Costas to opt out from having to cover the [[XFL]]. He publicly denigrated the league throughout its existence and remains a vocal critic of the league and its premise.\n\nIn [[2006 NFL season|2006]], Costas returned to NFL studio hosting duties for NBC's new ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'', hosting its pre-game show ''[[Football Night in America]]''. Costas last hosted NFL telecasts for NBC in [[1992 NFL season|1992]] before being replaced in the studio by [[Jim Lampley]] and subsequently, [[Greg Gumbel]].  Before becoming the studio host for ''[[NFL on NBC|The NFL on NBC]]'' in [[1984 NFL season|1984]], Costas did play-by-play of NFL games with analyst [[Bob Trumpy]].\n\nCostas is nicknamed \"Rapping Roberto\" by New York City's ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' sports media columnist Bob Raissman.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/story/451507p-380022c.html | title=NBC out-Foxed in opener | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | author=Raissman, Bob | date=September 12, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Al Michaels]] also called him \"Rapping Roberto\" during the telecast between the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and the [[2006 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on September 10, 2006, in response to Costas calling him \"Alfalfa\".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2006-09-10-weekend_x.htm | title=Scores, injury updates early fodder for NBC's Sunday-night NFL show | work = [[USA Today]] | author= Hiestand, Michael | date= September 11, 2006}}</ref>\n\n====National Hockey League====\nCostas hosted [[NHL on NBC|NBC's coverage]] of the [[2008 NHL Winter Classic|2008]], [[2009 NHL Winter Classic|2009]], and the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic]].<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=346955 NHL.com \u2013 2008 NHL Winter Classic]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> He was scheduled to host coverage of the [[2011 NHL Winter Classic|2011]] event as well but, due to the game's postponement, Costas only hosted pre-game coverage before leaving to go to [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] for his duties with NBC's NFL coverage the next night.

At the World Championships, four Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned substance [[Triamterene]], a diuretic used to dilute urine samples to mask the presence of anabolic steroids.

During that period, Costas also served as the imaging voice of Clear Channel-owned [[KLOU]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], during that station's period as \"My 103.3\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://formatchange.com/1033-klou-becomes-my-1033/|title=103.3 KLOU becomes \"My 103.3\" - Format Change Archive|date=18 June 2007|publisher=}}</ref> Like ''Later'', Costas' radio shows have focused on a wide variety of topics and have not been limited to sports discussion.\n\nCostas hosted ''[[Later (talk show)|Later with Bob Costas]]'' on NBC from 1988 until 1994. This late night show created by [[Dick Ebersol]], coming on at 1:30&nbsp;a.m. as the third program in NBC's nightly lineup after ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', was something of a break from the typical TV talk show format of the era, featuring Costas and a single guest conversing for the entire half hour, without a band, opening monologue or studio audience. On several occasions, Costas held the guest over for multiple nights. The show was taped in [[GE Building]]'s studios 3B or 8H at the [[Rockefeller Center|Rockefeller Plaza]], with Costas interviewing the guest for 45 minutes to an hour before turning the material over to editors who condensed it down to 22 minutes plus commercial breaks.<ref>{{YouTube|pmyB934SsDI|Later 1994}}.</ref> More popular guests were given two or three part interviews that ran consecutive nights. In August 1991, [[Mel Brooks]] became the only guest for four consecutive nights in the series' history. The program was critically acclaimed, and twice nominated for Emmy's during its {{frac|5|1|2}}-year run, with Costas as host. It won the Emmy Award for Best Informational Series in 1993.\n\nCostas decided to leave ''Later'' after six seasons, having grown tired of the commute to New York City from his home in St. Louis and wishing to lighten his workload in order to spend more time with his family. He also turned down an offer from [[David Letterman]], who moved to [[CBS]] in 1995, to follow him there and become the first host of ''[[The Late Late Show (U.S. TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'', which was being developed by Letterman's company to air at 12:30 after the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-01/entertainment/ca-15250_1_late-night</ref>\n\nIn June 2005, Costas was named by [[CNN]] president [[Jonathan Klein (CNN)|Jonathan Klein]] as a regular substitute anchor for [[Larry King]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'' for one year. Costas, as well as Klein, have said Costas was not trying out for King's position on a permanent basis. [[Nancy Grace]] was also named a regular substitute host for the show.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/09/entertainment/main700753.shtml | title=CNN Hires Bob Costas | publisher= Associated Press (via [[CBS News]]) | date= June 9, 2005}}</ref> On August 18, 2005, Costas refused to host a ''Larry King Live'' broadcast where the subject was missing teenager [[Natalee Holloway]]. Costas said that because there were no new developments in the story, he felt it had no news value, and he was uncomfortable with television's drift in the direction of tabloid-type stories.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/arts/television/24cost.html | title=Bob Costas Says No to Hour on Aruba | website= The New York Times | date= August 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in October 2011, Costas was a correspondent for ''[[Rock Center with Brian Williams]]''.

[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283207/ 'On the Record with Bob Costas' (2001)\"]. [[Internet Movie Database]].</ref> ''On the Record with Bob Costas'' was similar to the format of the old ''Later'' program as they both concentrated on in-depth interviews. In 2005, ''On the Record with Bob Costas'' was revamped to become ''[[Costas Now]]'', a monthly issue oriented sports program that occasionally employed a town hall style format.\n\nIn [[2002 NFL season|2002]], Costas began a stint as co-host of HBO's long-running series ''[[Inside the NFL]]''. Costas remained host of ''Inside the NFL'' through the end of the [[2007 NFL season]]. He hosted the show with [[Cris Collinsworth]] and former NFL legends [[Dan Marino]] and [[Cris Carter]]. The program aired each week during the NFL season.\n\nCostas left HBO to sign with [[MLB Network]] in February 2009.\n\n===MLB Network===\nAt the channel's launch on January 1, 2009, Costas hosted the premiere episode of ''All Time Games'', a presentation of the recently discovered [[kinescope]] of Game 5 of the [[1956 World Series]]. During the episode, he held a forum with [[Don Larsen]], who pitched MLB's only postseason [[perfect game]] during that game, and [[Yogi Berra]], who caught the game.\n\nCostas joined the network full-time on February 3, 2009. He hosts a regular interview show titled ''MLB Network Studio 42 with Bob Costas'' as well as special programming and provides play-by-play for select live baseball game telecasts.<ref>Press release (February 3, 2009).

The Astros went on to win 8-2. Unfortunately, Costas and his color commentator [[Jim Kaat]] received criticism for their \"bantering about minutia\" and misidentification of plays. Costas also went on to become an [[internet meme]] after using the term the \"sacks were juiced\" to describe the bases being loaded.<ref>http://www.weei.com/blogs/alex-reimer/please-keep-bob-costas-away-red-sox-playoff-games</ref>\n\n===NFL Network===\nAs aforementioned, Costas hosted ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' on NBC and [[NFL Network]] in [[2016 NFL season|2016]], having returned to broadcasting after a brief absence.\n\n===Other appearances===\nCostas provided significant contributions to the [[Ken Burns]], [[PBS]] mini series ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' as well as its follow-up ''[[Baseball (TV series)|The 10th Inning]]''. He also appears in another PBS film, ''[[A Time for Champions]]'', produced by [[St. Louis]]'s [[KETC|Nine Network of Public Media]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeforchampions.org/ |title=Time for Champions |publisher=Time for Champions |date= |accessdate= February 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Interests==\n\n===Love of baseball===\nCostas is a devoted baseball fan. He's been suggested as a potential [[Commissioner of Baseball|commissioner]] and wrote ''Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball'' in [[2000 in literature|2000]]. For his 40th birthday, then [[Oakland Athletics]] manager [[Tony La Russa]] allowed Costas to manage the club during a spring training game. The first time Costas visited baseball legend [[Stan Musial]]'s St. Louis eatery, he left a [[United States dollar|$]]3.31 tip on a ten dollar tab in homage to Musial's lifetime batting average (.331). Costas delivered the [[eulogy]] at [[Mickey Mantle]]'s [[funeral]]. In eulogizing Mantle, Costas described the baseball legend as ''\"a fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic\".'' Costas has even carried a [[1958 New York Yankees season|1958]] Mickey Mantle [[baseball card]] in his wallet. Costas also delivered the eulogy for Musial after his death in early 2013.\n\nCostas was outspoken about his disdain for Major League Baseball instituting a playoff [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]]. Costas believed it diminishes the significance and drama of winning a divisional championship. He prefers a system in which winning the wild card puts a team at some sort of disadvantage, as opposed to an equal level with teams who outplayed them over a 162-game season. Or, as explained in his book ''Fair Ball'', have only the three division winners in each league go to the postseason, with the team with the best record receiving a buy-in to the League Championship Series. Once, on the air on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Inside the NFL]]'', he mentioned that the NFL regular season counted for something, but baseball's was beginning to lose significance. With the advent of the second wild card, Costas has said he feels the format has improved, since there is now a greater premium placed on finishing first. He has suggested a further tweak: Make the wild card round a best two of three, instead of a single game, with all three games, if necessary, on the homefield of the wild card of the better record.\n\nCostas serves as a member of the advisory board of the [[Baseball Assistance Team]], a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties.\n\n===Political views===\n\n====George W. Bush====\n\nOn May 26, 2007, Costas discussed the presidency of [[George W. Bush]] on his radio show, stating he liked Bush personally, and had been optimistic about his presidency, but said the course of the Iraq war, and other mis-steps have led him to conclude Bush's presidency had \"tragically failed\" and considered it \"overwhelmingly evident, even if you're a conservative Republican, if you're honest about it, this is a failed administration.\"<ref>''Costas on the Radio'', May 26, 2007.</ref> The following summer, Costas interviewed Bush during the president's appearance at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.<ref name=\"ostrow2008\">{{cite news|last=Ostrow|first=Joanne| date = August 10, 2008 | title=Bob Costas, redeemed |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2008/08/10/bob-costas-redeemed/215/| publisher = ''Ostrow Off the Record'' (blog of ''[[The Denver Post]]'') |accessdate= August 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Gun culture controversy===\nDuring a segment on the ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' halftime show on December 2, 2012, Costas paraphrased [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] columnist [[Jason Whitlock]] in regard to [[Jovan Belcher]]'s murder-suicide the day prior, stating that the United States' [[Gun culture#Present-day gun culture in the United States|gun culture]] was causing more [[domestic violence|domestic dispute]]s to result in death, and that it was likely Belcher and his girlfriend would not have died had he not possessed a gun.<ref name=bi-costasbelcher>{{cite web|title=Bob Costas Got Blasted For His Gun-Control Monologue After Jovan Belcher's Murder-Suicide|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bob-costas-gun-control-jovan-belcher-chiefs-murder-suicide-kasandra-perkins-2012-12|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCritics interpreted his remarks as support for [[gun control]], resulting in mostly negative reactions. Many (including former Republican Presidential candidates [[Mike Huckabee]] and [[Herman Cain]])<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc/> felt that Costas should not have used a program typically viewed as entertainment to publicize political views on sensitive topics, [[Lou Dobbs]] criticized his remarks for supporting the abolition of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] by quoting a [[sports writer]], while [[Andrew Levy]] remarked that he had been given a civics lecture by someone who had \"gotten rich thanks in part to a sport that destroys men's bodies and brains.\"<ref name=nydn-costasguns>{{cite news|title=ob Costas delivers anti-gun message on Sunday Night Football one day after NFL player Jovan Belcher kills girlfriend, himself|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/costas-delivers-anti-gun-message-sunday-night-football-article-1.1212138|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref> However, liberal reporter [[Erik Wemple]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised Costas for speaking out for gun control on the broadcast, commenting that the incident's connection to the NFL provided him with an obligation to acknowledge the incident during the halftime show, stating that \"the things that [NFL players] do affect the public beyond whether their teams cover the point spread.

Costas did suggest that more regulation be placed on America's gun culture:<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc>{{cite news|last=Pengelly|first=Martin|title=Bob Costas defends 'gun culture' comments in MSNBC interview|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/05/bob-costas-gun-comments-msnbc-interview|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=9 December 2012|location=London|date=December 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Now, do I believe that we need more comprehensive and more sensible gun control legislation? Yes I do. That doesn't mean repeal the Second Amendment. That doesn't mean a prohibition on someone having a gun to protect their home and their family. It means sensible and more comprehensive gun control legislation. But even if you had that, you would still have the problem of what Jason Whitlock wrote about, and what I agree with. And that is a gun culture in this country.<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc/></blockquote>\n\n===2014 Winter Olympics===\nDuring his coverage of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], Costas was criticized by some conservative members of the media, including [[Michelle Malkin]] and [[Glenn Beck]] for supposedly praising [[Vladimir Putin]]'s role in defusing tensions surrounding Syria, and Iran.<ref name=\"NBC Steers Clear\">{{cite news|last1=Farhi|first1=Paul|title=In coverage of Olympics, NBC has largely steered clear of controversy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/olympics/in-coverage-of-olympics-nbc-has-largely-steered-clear-of-controversy/2014/02/21/5e68a088-99aa-11e3-80ac-63a8ba7f7942_story.html|accessdate=28 October 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=February 21, 2014}}</ref> Several media commentators, including [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Bernard Goldberg]], defended Costas' remarks as factually correct and pointed out that Costas had also voiced considerable criticism of both Russia and Putin while broadcasting from [[Sochi]].

However, the network announced shortly before the game that [[Liam McHugh]] would instead join [[Dan Patrick]] as a co-host, leading to speculation that NBC removed Costas from the NFL's biggest game over his comments. Costas has denied such, stating that it made more sense for McHugh, who had been hosting [[Thursday Night Football|Thursday night games]] that aired on NBC, to serve in that capacity. \"It wouldn't be right for me to parachute in,\" claimed Costas.<ref>{{cite news| author = Putterman, Alex | url=http://awfulannouncing.com/nbc/bob-costas-wont-work-super-bowl-nbc-prompting-question-whether-anti-nfl-comments-blame.html | work = [[Awful Announcing]] | title= Bob Costas won't work Super Bowl for NBC, even though he's also not working the Olympics| date= January 22, 2018 | accessdate = January 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Jill Sutton & Bob Costas at 2014 MIFF.jpg|thumb|Costas and Jill Sutton at the 2014 [[Miami International Film Festival]]]]\nCostas was married from 1983 to 2001 to Carole \"Randy\" Randall Krummenacher.

The town, first mentioned in 902, grew up by the castle ''{{lang|de|Babenberch}}'' which gave its name to the [[Babenberg]] family. On their extinction it passed to the [[Saxony|Saxon]] house.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bamberg|volume=3|pages=301-302}}</ref> The area was Christianized chiefly by the monks of the [[Rule of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Fulda Abbey]], and the land was under the spiritual authority of the [[Diocese of W\u00fcrzburg]].\n\nIn 1007, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] made Bamberg a family inheritance, the seat of a separate [[diocese]]. The Emperor's purpose in this was to make the Diocese of W\u00fcrzburg less unwieldy in size and to give Christianity a firmer footing in the districts of [[Franconia]], east of Bamberg. In 1008, after long negotiations with the Bishops of W\u00fcrzburg and [[Diocese of Eichst\u00e4tt|Eichst\u00e4tt]], who were to cede portions of their dioceses, the boundaries of the new diocese were defined, and [[Pope John XVIII]] granted the papal confirmation in the same year. Henry II ordered the building of a new [[Bamberg Cathedral|cathedral]], which was consecrated 6 May 1012. The church was enriched with gifts from the [[pope]], and Henry had it dedicated in honor of him. In 1017 Henry also founded [[Michaelsberg Abbey, Bamberg|Michaelsberg Abbey]] on the Michaelsberg (\"Mount St. Michael\"), near Bamberg, a Benedictine abbey for the training of the clergy. The emperor and his wife [[Cunigunde of Luxemburg|Kunigunde]] gave large temporal possessions to the new diocese, and it received many privileges out of which grew the secular power of the bishop.

While he was here he placed the diocese in direct dependence on the [[Holy See]]. He also personally consecrated some of Bamberg's churches. For a short time Bamberg was the centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In 1248 and 1260 the see obtained large portions of the estates of the [[Duke of Merania|Counts of Meran]], partly through purchase and partly through the appropriation of extinguished fiefs. The old [[Bishopric of Bamberg]] was composed of an unbroken territory extending from [[Schl\u00fcsselfeld]] in a northeasterly direction to the [[Franconian Forest]], and possessed in addition estates in the Duchies of [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[Salzburg]], in the [[Nordgau (Bavaria)|Nordgau]] (the present [[Upper Palatinate]]), in [[Thuringia]], and on the [[Danube]].

When the secularization of church lands took place (1802) the diocese covered {{convert|3305|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and had a population of 207,000. Bamberg thus lost its independence in 1802, becoming part of [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] in 1803.\n\nBamberg was first connected to the German rail system in 1844, which has been an important part of its infrastructure ever since. After a communist uprising took control over Bavaria in the years following [[World War I]], the state government fled to Bamberg and stayed there for almost two years before the Bavarian capital of [[Munich]] was retaken by ''[[Freikorps]]'' units (see [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]). The first republican constitution of Bavaria was passed in Bamberg, becoming known as the ''Bamberger Verfassung'' (Bamberg Constitution).\n\nIn February 1926 Bamberg served as the venue for the [[Bamberg Conference]], convened by [[Adolf Hitler]] in his attempt to foster unity and to stifle dissent within the then-young [[Nazi party]].

From northeast to southwest, the town is divided into first the Regnitz plain, then one large and several small islands formed by two arms of the Regnitz (''{{lang|de|Inselstadt}}''), and finally the part of town on the hills, the \"Hill Town\" (''{{lang|de|Bergstadt}}'').\n\n===The seven hills of Bamberg===\nBamberg extends over seven hills, each crowned by a beautiful church.

The town established a documentation centre in 2005 to support World Heritage activities.\nSome of the main sights are:\n\n* [[Bamberg Cathedral]] (1237), with the tombs of Emperor Henry II and [[Pope Clement II]]\n* ''{{lang|de|Alte Hofhaltung}}'', residence of the bishops in the 16th and 17th centuries\n* ''{{lang|de|Neue Residenz}}'', residence of the bishops after the 17th century\n* [[Bamberg State Library]] in the New Residence\n* Old town hall (1386), built in the middle of the Regnitz river, accessible by two bridges\n* ''{{lang|de|Klein-Venedig}}'' (\"Little Venice\"), a colony of fishermen's houses from the 19th century along one bank of the river Regnitz\n* [[Michaelsberg Abbey, Bamberg|Michaelsberg Abbey]], built in the 12th century on one of Bamberg's \"Seven Hills\"\n* {{lang|de|[[Altenburg (Bamberg)|Altenburg]]}}, castle, former residence of the bishops\n\n; Cathedral:\n[[Bamberg Cathedral]] is a late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building with four towers. It was founded in 1004 by Emperor Henry II, finished in 1012<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> and consecrated on 6 May 1012. It was later partially destroyed by fire in 1081. The new cathedral, built by Saint [[Otto of Bamberg]], was consecrated in 1111 and in the 13th century received its present late-Romanesque form.\n\nThe cathedral is {{convert|94|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|28|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|26|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, and the four towers are each about {{convert|81|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. It contains many historic works of art, such as the marble tomb of the founder and his wife, considered one of the greatest works of the sculptor [[Tilman Riemenschneider]], and carved between 1499 and 1513. Another treasure of the cathedral is an [[equestrian statue]] known as the [[Bamberg Horseman]] (''{{lang|de|Der Bamberger Reiter}}'').<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> This statue, possibly depicting the emperor [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]], most likely dates to the second quarter of the 13th century. The statue also serves as a symbol of the town of Bamberg.\n\n; {{lang|de|Neue Residenz}}:\nThe ''{{lang|de|Neue Residenz}}'' (New Residence) (1698\u20131704) was initially occupied by the prince-bishops, and from 1864 to 1867 by the deposed King [[Otto of Greece]]. Its ''{{lang|de|Rosengarten}}'' (Rose Garden) overlooks the town. It has over 4500 roses.<ref>{{cite web |title=The World\u2019s 10 Most Beautiful Gardens Revealed |url=http://www.onlineread.org/10-beautiful-gardens-around-world/ |publisher=onlineread.org |accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n; {{lang|de|Altenburg}}:\n[[Image:AltenburgEingang.jpg|thumb|left|Bamberg [[Altenburg (Bamberg)|Altenburg]]]]\n\nThe {{lang|de|[[Altenburg (Bamberg)|Altenburg]]}} is located on the highest of Bamberg's seven hills. It was mentioned for the first time in 1109.<ref>[http://www.roadstoruins.com/altenburg.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411093159/http://www.roadstoruins.com/altenburg.htm |date=April 11, 2013 }}</ref>  Between 1251 and 1553 it was the residence of Bamberg's bishops. Destroyed in 1553 by [[Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach]], it was used, after scanty repairs, only as a prison, and increasingly decayed.\n\nIn 1801, A. F. Marcus bought the castle and completely repaired it. His friend, the famous German writer [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], who was very impressed by the building, lived there for a while. The next owner, Anton von Greifenstein, in 1818 founded an association to save the castle. This society still maintains the whole property today. The Altenburg today houses a restaurant.\n\n; Other sights:\nOther churches are the ''{{lang|de|Jakobskirche}}'', an 11th-century Romanesque [[basilica]]; the ''{{lang|de|St. Martinskirche}}''; the ''{{lang|de|Marienkirche}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Obere Pfarrkirche}}'' (1320\u20131387), which has now been restored to its original pure [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style. The ''{{lang|de|[[Michaelskirche, Bamberg|Michaelskirche]]}}'', 12th century Romanesque (restored), on the Michaelsberg, was formerly the church of the [[Rule of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Michaelsberg Abbey, Bamberg|Michaelsberg Abbey]] secularized in 1803 and now contains the ''{{lang|de|B\u00fcrgerspital}}'', or [[almshouse]], and the [[museum]] and municipal art collections.\n\nOf the bridges connecting the sections of the lower town the ''{{lang|de|Obere Br\u00fccke}}'' was completed in 1455. Halfway across this, on an island, is the ''{{lang|de|Rathaus}}'' or town hall (rebuilt 1744-1756). The lyceum, formerly a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college, contains a natural history museum. The old palace (''{{lang|de|Alte Hofhaltung}}'') was built in 1591 on the site of an old residence of the counts of [[Babenberg]]. Monuments include the Maximilian fountain (1880), with statues of [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King Maximilian I of Bavaria]], the emperor Henry II and his wife, [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] and [[Otto of Bamberg|Saint Otto]], bishop of Bamberg.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThere are also underground tunnels beneath the town. These were originally constructed as mines which supplied sandstone which could be used for construction or as an abrasive cleaner. Mining came to an end in 1920 but a {{convert|7.5|mi|km|adj=on}} tunnel network remained. The tunnels were used as an [[air raid shelter]] during World War II.  A part of the network can be visited on a guided tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123065934/http://www.stripes.com/military-life/travel/bamberg-underground-tour-holds-deeper-understanding-of-city-s-history-1.63408|title=Bamberg: Underground tour holds deeper understanding of city's history - Travel - Stripes|author=|date=23 January 2015|website=archive.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Beer ===\nBamberg is known for its smoked [[Rauchbier]] and is home to nine breweries, [[Brauerei F\u00e4ssla]], [[Brauerei Greifenklau]], Brauerei Heller-Trum ([[Schlenkerla]]), [[Brauerei Kaiserdom]], [[Brauerei Keesmann|Keesmann Br\u00e4u]], [[Klosterbr\u00e4u Bamberg|Klosterbr\u00e4u]], [[Brauerei Mahr|Mahrs Br\u00e4u]] and [[Brauerei Spezial]], and one [[brewpub]], [[Ambr\u00e4usianum Bamberg|Ambr\u00e4usianum]]. Every August there is a five-day ''{{lang|de|Sandkerwa}}'', a [[kirmess]] celebrated with beers.<ref>[http://www.sandkerwa.de/startseite/ Sandkerwa Bamberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823025923/http://www.sandkerwa.de/startseite/ |date=2013-08-23 }} (German)</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nThe [[University of Bamberg]], named Otto-Friedrich University, offers higher education in the areas of [[social science]], [[business studies]] and the [[humanities]], and is attended by more than 13,000 students. The University of Applied Sciences Bamberg offers higher education in the areas of [[public health]]. Bamberg is also home to eight secondary schools ([[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]]):\n* Clavius-Gymnasium\n* [[Dientzenhofer]]-Gymnasium\n* Eichendorff-Gymnasium\n* [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]-Gymnasium\n* Franz-Ludwig-Gymnasium\n* Kaiser-Heinrich-Gymnasium\n* Maria-Ward-Gymnasium\n* Theresianum\nThere are also numerous other institutes for primary, secondary, technical, vocational and adult education.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n===Transport===\n\n==== Railway ====\nThe [[InterCityExpress]] main line #28 ([[Munich]] - [[Nuremberg]] - [[Leipzig]] - [[Berlin]] / [[Hamburg]]) runs through [[Bamberg station]] on the [[Nuremberg\u2013Bamberg railway|Nuremberg\u2013Bamberg]] and the [[Bamberg\u2013Hof railway|Bamberg\u2013Hof lines]]. It takes less than two hours to Munich on the train and with the [[Nuremberg\u2013Erfurt high-speed railway]] through the Thuringian mountains finished in 2017 less than three hours to Berlin.\n\nEast-west connections are poorer. Bamberg is connected to other towns in eastern Upper Franconia such as [[Bayreuth]], [[Coburg]], and [[Kronach]] via the [[Bamberg\u2013Hof railway|Bamberg\u2013Hof line]] with trains usually running at least every hour. Connections on the [[W\u00fcrzburg\u2013Bamberg railway|W\u00fcrzburg\u2013Bamberg line]] to the west are hourly regional trains to W\u00fcrzburg, which is fully connected to the ICE network. Tourists arriving at [[Frankfurt International Airport]] can take advantage of the new direct connection from Frankfurt main station.\n\n==== Motorways ====\nBamberg is not near any of the major (i.e. single-digit) [[autobahns]]. But it is nevertheless well connected to the network in all directions: the [[Bundesautobahn 70|A70]] from [[Schweinfurt]] (connecting to the [[Bundesautobahn 7|A7]] there) to Bayreuth (connecting to the [[Bundesautobahn 9|A9]]) runs along the northern edge of the town. The [[Bundesautobahn 73|A73]] on the eastern side of town connects Bamberg to Nuremberg (connecting to the [[Bundesautobahn 9|A9]]) and [[Thuringia]], ending at [[Suhl]].\n\n==== Air transport ====\nBamberg is served by [[Bamberg-Breitenau Airfield]]. Mostly public aircraft operate there. It used to be a military airport. (IATA-Code: ZCD, ICAO-Code: EDQA) It is also possible to charter public flights to and from this airport.\n\nMost international tourists who travel by plane arrive at [[Frankfurt International Airport]] or [[Munich Airport]]. The nearest major airport is [[Nuremberg Airport]] which can be reached within half an hour by car or one hour by train and subway.\n\n==== Water transport ====\n[[File:Bamberg-Liebherr-crane-4295172.jpg|thumb|Cranes in Bamberg harbor]]\nBoth the [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal]] and its predecessor, the [[Ludwig Canal]], begin near Bamberg. The Ludwig Canal was opened in 1846 but closed in 1950 after damage during the [[World War II|second world war]]. With the completion of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in 1992, uninterrupted water transport was again made possible between the [[North Sea]] and the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==== Local public transport ====\nLocal public transport within Bamberg relies exclusively on buses. More than 20 routes connect the outlying quarters and some villages in the vicinity to the central bus station. In addition, there are several \"Night Lines\" (the last of these, though, tend to run around midnight) and some [[park-and-ride]] lines from parking lots on the periphery to the town centre. <br />A short-lived tram system existed in the 1920s.\n\n=== Military bases ===\nBamberg was an important base for the Bavarian, German and then American military stationed at [[Warner Barracks in Bamberg, Germany|Warner Barracks]]. Warner Barracks was closed in the fall of 2014, with the last battalion leaving being the 54th Engineer Battalion and returned to the German government. In 2016, a large part of the facility was taken over by the [[German Federal Police]] for training purposes.\nMuna Kasserne was a small base occupied by the 504th Maintenance Company, 71st Maintenance Bn. It was part of Warner Barracks although located separately.\n\n==Governance==\nBamberg is an urban district, or ''kreisfreie Stadt''. Its town council (''Stadtrat'') and its mayor (''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'') are elected every six years, though not in the same year. Thus, the last municipal election for the town council was in 2014, for the mayor in 2012. As an exception to the six-year term, the term starting in 2012 will take eight years to synchronize the elections with those in the rest of Bavaria.\n\nAs of the elections of 16 March 2014, the 44 member strong town council comprises 12 [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] councillors, 10 [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] councillors, 8 [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]] councillors, 4 councillors of the ''Bamberger B\u00fcrger-Block'' and 4 of the ''Freie W\u00e4hler'' (Free Voters), both local political movements. These five parties achieved the number of councillors necessary to form a [[parliamentary group]]. In addition, there are 3 councillors of the ''Bamberger Unabh\u00e4ngige B\u00fcrger'' and the 1 councillor each of the ''Bamberger Realisten'', the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] and the ''Bamberger Linke Liste''.\n\nThe previous council, elected on 2 March 2008, was composed of 15 [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] councillors, 10 [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] councillors, 7 [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]] councillors, 5 councillors of the Bamberger B\u00fcrger-Block and 3 of the Freie W\u00e4hler (Free Voters), both local political movements. These five parties achieved the number of councillors necessary to form a [[parliamentary group]]. In addition, there were 2 councillors of the ''Bamberger Realisten'' and one of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] and the [[Republicans (Germany)|Republikaner]], making them ineligible for caucus status.\n\n=== Mayors since 1945 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Years\n!Mayor\n!Party\n|-\n|1945\u20131958\n|[[Luitpold Weegmann]]\n|[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]\n|-\n|1958\u20131982\n|[[Theodor Mathieu]]\n|[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]\n|-\n|1982\u20131994\n|[[Paul R\u00f6hner]]\n|[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]\n|-\n|1994\u20132006\n|[[Herbert Lauer]]\n|Independent\n|-\n|2006\u2013Present\n|[[Andreas Starke]]\n|[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]\n|}\n\n=== Town twinning===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\nBamberg is [[town twinning|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Bedford]], [[United Kingdom]]\n* {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Esztergom]], [[Hungary]]\n* {{flagicon|Austria}} [[Feldkirchen in K\u00e4rnten|Feldkirchen]], [[Austria]]\n* {{flagicon|Czech Republic}} [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]\n* {{flagicon|France}} [[Rodez]], [[France]]\n* {{flagicon|Austria}} [[Villach]], [[Austria]]\n* {{flagicon|United States}} [[Fredonia, New York]], [[United States]]\n* {{flagicon|Japan}} [[Nagaoka, Niigata]], [[Japan]]\n\n== Notable people==\n\n[[File:Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Prince de Neufch\u00e2tel et de Wagram, mar\u00e9chal de France (1753-1815).jpg|thumb|130px|Louis-Alexandre Berthier 1808]]\n\n=== A-K ===\n* [[Annette von Aretin]] (1920\u20132006), first television announcer of the [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]]\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Adam Bader|de}}, (1789 in Bamberg; \u2020 1870 in Berlin), [[tenor]]\n* [[Dorothee B\u00e4r]] (born 1978), Member of Parliament (CSU), State Secretary of the Federal Minister of Transport and Digital Infrastructure\n* [[Wilhelm Batz]], (1916\u20131988), [[Luftwaffe]], ace\n* [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]], (1753\u20131815), Chief of Staff to Napoleon Bonaparte\n* [[Joachim Camerarius]] (1500\u20131574), humanist, polymath and poet\n* [[Claudia Ciesla]], (born 1987), Polish-German actress\n* [[Pope Clement II]], (died 1047), bishop of Bamberg from 1040\u201346\n* [[Christopher Clavius]], (1538\u20131612), mathematician, astronomer and Jesuit\n* [[Conrad III of Germany]], (1093-1152), king of Germany\n* [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], (c. 975-1040), empress consort, regent of the Holy Roman Empire and wife of Henry II\n* [[Stefan Dassler]] (born 1962), non-fiction author\n* [[G\u00fcnther Denzler]] (born 1948), former district administrator of Bamberg (CSU)\n* [[Karlheinz Deschner]] (1924\u20132014), writer and critic of religion and the church\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Gottfried Diener (philogist)|de|3=Gottfried Diener|lt=Gottfried Diener}} (1907\u20131987), philologist and Goethe researcher\n* [[Ignaz Dollinger]] (1770\u20131841), physician\n* [[Ignaz von Dollinger]] (1799\u20131890), important Catholic theologian and church historian\n* [[Curt Echtermeyer]], also known as Curt Bruckner (1896\u20131971), painter\n* [[Erich Ebermayer]] (1900\u20131970), writer\n* [[Hans Ehard]] (1887\u20131980), lawyer and politician\n* [[G\u00fcnter Faltin]] (born 1944), university teacher\n* [[Heinrich Finck]] (1444\u20131527), conductor and composer\n* [[Klaus-Dieter Fritsche]] (born 1953), jurist and politician (CSU), \n* [[Karl von Gareis]] (1844\u20131923), a lawyer and author, member of the Reichstag\n* [[Nora-Eugenie Gomringer]], (born 1980), poet and writer\n* [[Thomas Gottschalk]] (born 1950), moderator, TV-presenter, actor\n* [[Lukas G\u00f6rtler]] (born 1994), football player\n* [[Hans Grassmann]] (born 1960), physicist and author\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Joseph Heller (collector)|de|3=Joseph Heller (Bamberg)|lt=Joseph Heller}} (1798\u20131849), collector, today Helleriana in Bamberg State Library\n* [[Karl H\u00f6ller]] (1907\u20131987), composer\n* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], (1770\u20131831), German philosopher\n* [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], (973-1024), Holy Roman Emperor\n* [[E.

Mumy worked again with Harris on the retrospective special ''Lost In Space: Forever'' (1998), where they reprised their roles in a scene written by Mumy (Harris rewrote his own lines). This occurred the year after the rest of the cast (including both Mumy and Harris) stated in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' article that the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] planned to do a ''Lost in Space'' marathon while promoting a new movie. Harris was to appear in the planned TV movie, ''Lost in Space: The Journey Home'', but died before production was scheduled to start, in 2002, and it was subsequently cancelled.

Tocquigny said that at age five, Mumy was too young to watch his mentor's show ''[[The Third Man (TV series)|The Third Man]]'', which would have been aired late at night, but he was old enough to see ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lifelessonsnetwork/2010/09/22/bill-mumy-of-lost-in-space-fame-shares-his-life-lessons| title=Bill Mumy of Lost in Space fame shares his life lessons| publisher=[[BlogTalkRadio]]| date=September 22, 2010| accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nOn June 14, 2006, Mumy got to work with Harris one last time, though posthumously. Years before Harris died, he recorded voice work for the animated short ''[[The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas]],'' narrating the film and playing the part of The Bolt.

Mumy noted: \"I never really had too many uncomfortable moments working with any actor. I was comfortable working with most everybody. It\u2019s just the more that Jonathan and I did together, the more he changed the character. He really changed the character of Dr. Smith himself. He really turned him from a snarling saboteur villain to this bumbling insulting kook. The more he played it for comedy, the more Irwin Allen liked it. The show really went the way that Jonathan led it. But we had great chemistry together, and we never had a bad day. We were always prepared, as was Bobby May who was inside the robot. When we had our work to do\u2014and I think this is a very big reason [for] the way it went\u2014they\u2019d get us done in a couple of takes. Nobody screwed up.

Napoleon turned the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' against every major European power and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He installed members of his family on the thrones of client states, extending the power of the dynasty.\n\nThe House of Bonaparte formed the [[Imperial House of France (First French Empire)|Imperial House of France]] during the French Empire, together with some non-Bonaparte family members. In addition to holding the title of [[Emperor of the French]], the Bonaparte dynasty held various other titles and territories during the Napoleonic Wars, including their ancestral [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], the [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Kingdom of Spain]], the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], the [[Kingdom of Holland]], and the [[Kingdom of Naples (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Naples]]. The dynasty held power for around a decade until the Napoleonic Wars began to take their toll. Making very powerful enemies, such as [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], as well as royalist (particularly [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]) restorational movements in France, Spain, the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]], and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], the dynasty eventually collapsed due to the final defeat of Napoleon at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and the restoration of former dynasties by the [[Congress of Vienna]].\n\nDuring the reign of Napoleon I, the Imperial Family consisted of the Emperor's immediate relations \u2013 his wife, son, siblings, and some other close relatives, namely [[Joachim Murat]], [[Joseph Fesch]], and [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]].\n\nBetween 1852 and 1870, there was a [[Second French Empire]], when a member of the Bonaparte dynasty again ruled France: [[Napoleon III]], the youngest son of [[Louis Bonaparte]]. However, during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u20131871, the dynasty was again ousted from the Imperial Throne. Since that time, there has been a series of pretenders. Supporters of the Bonaparte family's claim to the [[throne of France]] are known as [[Bonapartists]]. Current head [[Jean-Christophe, Prince Napol\u00e9on]], has a Bourbon mother.\n\n==Italian origins==\nThe Bonaparte (originally ''Buonaparte'') family were [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]] in the Italian towns of [[Sarzana]], [[San Miniato]] and [[Florence, Italy|Florence]]. The name derives from Italian: ''buona'' (\"good\") and ''parte'' (\"part\" or \"side\").\n \nGianfaldo Buonaparte was the first known Buonaparte at Sarzana around 1200. His descendant Giovanni Buonaparte in 1397 married Isabella Calandrini, a cousin of later cardinal [[Filippo Calandrini]]. Giovanni became mayor of Sarzana and was named commissioner of the [[Lunigiana]] by [[Giovanni Maria Visconti]] in 1408. Their great-grandson Francesco Buonaparte was an equestrian [[mercenary]] at the service of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] [[Bank of Saint George]]. In 1490, he went to the island of [[Corsica]], which was controlled by the bank. In 1493, he married the daughter of Guido da Castelletto, representative of the Bank of Saint George in [[Ajaccio]], Corsica. Most of their descendants during subsequent generations were members of the Ajaccio town council. Napoleon's father, [[Carlo Buonaparte]], received a [[patent of nobility]] from the King of France in 1771.<ref name=Horricks/>\n\nThere also existed a Buonaparte family in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], however its eventual relation with the Sarzana and San Miniato families is unknown. [[Jacopo Buonaparte]] of San Miniato was a friend and advisor to [[Medici]] [[Pope Clement VII]]. Jacopo was also a witness to and wrote an account of the [[sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]], which is one of the most important historical documents recounting that event.<ref>Jacopo Bonaparte: ''Sac de Rome''. \u00c9crit EN 1527 par Jacques Bonaparte. T\u00e9moin oculaire, hrsgg. by Bonaparte, Napol\u00e9on Louis, Florenz 1850</ref> Two of Jacopo's nephews, Pier Antonio Buonaparte and Giovanni Buonaparte, however, took part in the 1527 Medici rebellion, after which they were banished from Florence and later were restored by [[Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence]]. Jacopo's brother Benedetto Buonaparte maintained political neutrality.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The partbooks of a Florentine ex-patriate: new light on Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Ms. Magl.

Due to his indisputable popularity in France both among the people and in the army, he successfully took part in the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]], overthrew the [[French Directory|Directory]] with the help of his brother, [[Lucien Bonaparte]], president of the [[Council of Five Hundred]], and participated in the creation of a new Constitution, which allowed him to become the First Consul of France on 10 November 1799. 2 December 1804, he crowned himself Emperor of the French and ruled from 1804 to 1814, and again in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]] after his return from Elba.\n\nFollowing his conquest of most of Western Europe, Napoleon I made his elder brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] (1768\u20131844) king first of Naples (1806\u20131808) and then of Spain (1808\u20131813), his younger brother [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]] (1778\u20131846) King of Holland (1806\u20131810; subsequently forcing his abdication after his failure to subordinate Dutch interests to those of France), and his youngest brother [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|J\u00e9r\u00f4me]] (1784\u20131860) King of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], the short-lived realm created from some of the states of northwestern Germany (1807\u20131813).\n\nNapoleon's son [[Napoleon II|Napol\u00e9on Fran\u00e7ois Charles Joseph]] (1811\u20131832) was created King of Rome (1811\u20131814) and was later styled as Napol\u00e9on II by loyalists of the dynasty, though he only ruled for two weeks after his father's abdication.\n\nLouis-Napol\u00e9on (1808\u20131873), son of Louis, was President of France (1848\u20131852) and then Emperor of the French (1852\u20131870), reigning as [[Napoleon III]]. His son, [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial]] (1856\u20131879), died fighting the [[Zulu people|Zulu]]s in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], today the South African province of [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. With his death, the family lost much of its remaining political appeal, though claimants continue to assert their right to the imperial title. A political movement for Corsican independence surfaced in the 1990s which included a Bonapartist restoration in its programme.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Crowns held by the family==\n\n===Emperors of the French===\n*[[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] (1804\u20131814, 1815), also [[King of Italy]] (1805\u20131814) and [[Elba|Emperor in Elba]] (1814\u20131815) and [[Co-Prince of Andorra]] (1804\u20131814, 1815)\n*[[Napoleon II]] (1815), styled as King of Rome from birth, but never reigned and also [[Z\u00e1kupy#Duke of Reichstadt|Duke of Reichstadt]] 1818\u20131832, but never visited the town)\n*[[Napoleon III]] (1852\u20131870), also [[Co-Prince of Andorra]] (1852\u20131870)\n\n===Kings of Holland===\n*[[Louis Bonaparte|Louis I]] (1806\u20131810)\n*[[Napol\u00e9on Louis Bonaparte|Louis II]] (1810), also [[Grand Duchy of Berg|Grand Duke of Berg]] (1809\u20131813)\n\n===King of Naples===\n*[[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph I]] (1806\u20131808)\n\n===King of Westphalia===\n*[[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|J\u00e9r\u00f4me I]] (1807\u20131813)\n\n===King of Spain===\n*[[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph I]] (1808\u20131813)\n\n===Grand Duchess of Tuscany===\n* [[Elisa Bonaparte]] (1809\u20131814), also [[Principality of Lucca and Piombino|Princess of Lucca and Piombino]] (1805\u20131814)\n\n==Heads of the House of Bonaparte (since 1852)==\n{{see also|Line of succession to the French throne (Bonapartist)}}\n*[[Napol\u00e9on III]] (1852\u20131873)\n*[[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Napol\u00e9on IV Eug\u00e8ne]] (1873\u20131879), son of Napol\u00e9on III\n*[[Victor, Prince Napol\u00e9on|Napol\u00e9on V Victor]] (1879\u20131926), grandson of Napol\u00e9on I's youngest brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]]\n*[[Louis, Prince Napol\u00e9on|Napol\u00e9on VI Louis]] (1926\u20131997), son of Napol\u00e9on V Victor\nDisputed since 1997:\n*[[Charles, Prince Napol\u00e9on|Napol\u00e9on VII Charles]] (1997\u2013present), son of Napol\u00e9on VI Louis\n*[[Jean-Christophe, Prince Napol\u00e9on|Napol\u00e9on VII Jean-Christophe]] (1997\u2013present), grandson of Napol\u00e9on VI Louis\n\n==The family tree==\n{{House of Bonaparte}}\n[[Carlo Buonaparte|'''Carlo'''-Maria]] ([[Ajaccio]], 1746\u2013[[Montpellier]], 1785) married [[Letizia Ramolino|Maria Letizia Ramolino]] (Ajaccio, 1750\u2013Rome, 1836) in 1764.

Beta sheets consist of '''beta strands''' (also '''\u03b2-strand''') connected laterally by at least two or three backbone [[hydrogen bond]]s, forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet. A \u03b2-strand is a stretch of [[peptide|polypeptide]] chain typically 3 to 10 [[amino acid]]s long with backbone in an extended conformation. The supramolecular association of \u03b2-sheets has been implicated in formation of the protein aggregates and fibrils observed in many human diseases, notably the [[amyloidosis|amyloidoses]] such as [[Alzheimer's disease]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:1gwe antipar betaSheet both.png|thumb|right|500px| An example of a 4-stranded [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] \u03b2-sheet fragment from a crystal structure of the enzyme [[catalase]] ([[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] file 1GWE at 0.88&nbsp;\u00c5 resolution). a) Front view, showing the antiparallel hydrogen bonds (dotted) between peptide NH and CO groups on adjacent strands. Arrows indicate chain direction, and electron density contours outline the non-hydrogen atoms. Oxygen atoms are red balls, nitrogen atoms are blue, and hydrogen atoms are omitted for simplicity; sidechains are shown only out to the first sidechain carbon atom (green). b) Edge-on view of the central two \u03b2-strands in a, showing the righthanded ''twist'' and the ''pleat'' of C<sup>\u03b1</sup>s and sidechains that alternately stick out in opposite directions from the sheet.]]\nThe first \u03b2-sheet structure was proposed by [[William Astbury]] in the 1930s. He proposed the idea of hydrogen bonding between the [[peptide bond]]s of parallel or antiparallel extended \u03b2-strands. However, Astbury did not have the necessary data on the bond geometry of the amino acids in order to build accurate models, especially since he did not then know that the [[peptide bond]] was planar. A refined version was proposed by [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Robert Corey]] in 1951. Their model incorporated the planarity of the peptide bond which they previously explained as resulting from keto-enol [[tautomerization]].\n\n==Structure and orientation==\n\n===Geometry===\nThe majority of \u03b2-strands are arranged adjacent to other strands and form an extensive [[hydrogen bond]] network with their neighbors in which the [[amine|N\u2212H]] groups in the backbone of one strand establish [[hydrogen bond]]s with the [[carbonyl|C=O]] groups in the backbone of the adjacent strands. In the fully extended \u03b2-strand, successive side chains point straight up, then straight down, then straight up, etc. Adjacent \u03b2-strands in a \u03b2-sheet are aligned so that their C<sup>\u03b1</sup> atoms are adjacent and their side chains point in the same direction. The \"pleated\" appearance of \u03b2-strands arises from tetrahedral chemical bonding at the C<sup>\u03b1</sup> atom; for example, if a side chain points straight up, then the bond to the C\u2032 must point slightly downwards, since its bond angle is approximately 109.5\u00b0. The pleating causes the distance between C{{su|p=\u03b1|b=''i''}} and C{{su|p=\u03b1|b=''i'' + 2}} to be approximately {{cvt|6|\u00c5|nm|lk=on}}, rather than the {{cvt|7.6|\u00c5|nm}} expected from two fully extended ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]'' [[peptide bond|peptide]]s. The \"sideways\" distance between adjacent C<sup>\u03b1</sup> atoms in [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] \u03b2-strands is roughly {{cvt|5|\u00c5|nm}}.\n[[File:Ramachandran plot general 100K.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Ramachandran (''\u03c6'',&nbsp;''\u03c8'') plot of about 100,000 high-resolution data points, showing the broad, favorable region around the conformation typical for \u03b2-sheet amino acid residues.]]\nHowever, \u03b2-strands are rarely perfectly extended; rather, they exhibit a twist.

[[Oxygen]] atoms are colored <span style=\"color:red;\">'''red'''</span> and [[nitrogen]] atoms colored <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''blue'''</span>.\n}}\nBecause peptide chains have a directionality conferred by their [[N-terminal end|N-terminus]] and [[C-terminal end|C-terminus]], \u03b2-strands too can be said to be directional. They are usually represented in protein topology diagrams by an arrow pointing toward the C-terminus. Adjacent \u03b2-strands can form [[hydrogen bond]]s in antiparallel, parallel, or mixed arrangements.\n\nIn an antiparallel arrangement, the successive \u03b2-strands alternate directions so that the N-terminus of one strand is adjacent to the C-terminus of the next. This is the arrangement that produces the strongest inter-strand stability because it allows the inter-strand hydrogen bonds between carbonyls and amines to be planar, which is their preferred orientation. The peptide backbone dihedral angles (''\u03c6'',&nbsp;''\u03c8'') are about (\u2013140\u00b0,&nbsp;135\u00b0) in antiparallel sheets. In this case, if two atoms C{{su|p=\u03b1|b=''i''}} and C{{su|p=\u03b1|b=''j''}} are adjacent in two [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] \u03b2-strands, then they form two mutual backbone hydrogen bonds to each other's flanking [[peptide bond|peptide groups]]; this is known as a '''close pair''' of hydrogen bonds.\n\nIn a parallel arrangement, all of the N-termini of successive strands are oriented in the same direction; this orientation may be slightly less stable because it introduces nonplanarity in the inter-strand hydrogen bonding pattern. The dihedral angles (''\u03c6'',&nbsp;''\u03c8'') are about (\u2013120\u00b0,&nbsp;115\u00b0) in parallel sheets. It is rare to find less than five interacting parallel strands in a motif, suggesting that a smaller number of strands may be unstable, however it is also fundamentally more difficult for parallel \u03b2-sheets to form because strands with N and C termini aligned necessarily must be very distant in sequence. There is also evidence that parallel \u03b2-sheet may be more stable since small amyloidogenic sequences appear to generally aggregate into \u03b2-sheet fibrils composed of primarily parallel \u03b2-sheet strands, where one would expect anti-parallel fibrils if anti-parallel were more stable.\n\nIn parallel \u03b2-sheet structure, if two atoms C{{su|p=\u03b1|b=''i''}} and C{{su|p=\u03b1|b=''j''}} are adjacent in two [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] \u03b2-strands, then they do ''not'' hydrogen bond to each other; rather, one residue forms hydrogen bonds to the residues that flank the other (but not vice versa). For example, residue ''i'' may form hydrogen bonds to residues ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and ''j''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1; this is known as a '''wide pair''' of hydrogen bonds. By contrast, residue ''j'' may hydrogen-bond to different residues altogether, or to none at all.\n\nFinally, an individual strand may exhibit a mixed bonding pattern, with a parallel strand on one side and an antiparallel strand on the other. Such arrangements are less common than a random distribution of orientations would suggest, suggesting that this pattern is less stable than the anti-parallel arrangement, however bioinformatic analysis always struggles with extracting structural thermodynamics since there are always numerous other structural features present in whole proteins. Also proteins are inherently constrained by folding kinetics as well as folding thermodynamics, so one must always be careful in concluding stability from bioinformatic analysis.\n\nThe [[hydrogen bond]]ing of \u03b2-strands need not be perfect, but can exhibit localized disruptions known as [[beta bulge|\u03b2-bulge]]s.\n\nThe hydrogen bonds lie roughly in the plane of the sheet, with the [[peptide bond|peptide]] [[carbonyl]] groups pointing in alternating directions with successive residues; for comparison, successive carbonyls point in the ''same'' direction in the [[alpha helix]].\n\n===Amino acid propensities===\nLarge aromatic residues ([[tyrosine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[tryptophan]]) and \u03b2-branched amino acids ([[threonine]], [[valine]], [[isoleucine]]) are favored to be found in \u03b2-strands in the ''middle'' of \u03b2-sheets. Different types of residues (such as [[proline]]) are likely to be found in the ''edge'' strands in \u03b2-sheets, presumably to avoid the \"edge-to-edge\" association between proteins that might lead to aggregation and [[amyloid]] formation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Richardson JS, Richardson DC | title = Natural beta-sheet proteins use negative design to avoid edge-to-edge aggregation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 5 | pages = 2754\u20139 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11880627 | pmc = 122420 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.052706099 }}</ref>\n\n==Common structural motifs==\n[[File:Beta hairpin.png|thumb|right|upright=0.6|The [[beta hairpin|\u03b2-hairpin]] motif]]\n[[File:Anthrax toxin protein key motif.svg|left|thumb|The Greek-key motif]]\nA very simple [[structural motif]] involving \u03b2-sheets is the [[beta hairpin|\u03b2-hairpin]], in which two antiparallel strands are linked by a short loop of two to five residues, of which one is frequently a [[glycine]] or a [[proline]], both of which can assume the dihedral-angle conformations required for a tight [[turn (biochemistry)|turn]] or a [[beta bulge loop|\u03b2-bulge loop]].

For example, the [[flavodoxin fold]] has a five-stranded, parallel \u03b2-sheet with topology 21345; thus, the edge strands are \u03b2-strand 2 and \u03b2-strand 5 along the backbone. Spelled out explicitly, \u03b2-strand 2 is H-bonded to \u03b2-strand 1, which is H-bonded to \u03b2-strand 3, which is H-bonded to \u03b2-strand 4, which is H-bonded to \u03b2-strand 5, the other edge strand. In the same system, the Greek key motif described above has a 4123 topology. The [[secondary structure]] of a \u03b2-sheet can be described roughly by giving the number of strands, their topology, and whether their [[hydrogen bond]]s are parallel or antiparallel.\n\n\u03b2-sheets can be ''open'', meaning that they have two edge strands (as in the [[flavodoxin fold]] or the [[immunoglobulin fold]]) or they can be ''closed [[beta-barrel|\u03b2-barrel]]s'' (such as the [[TIM barrel]]). [[beta-barrel|\u03b2-Barrels]] are often described by their ''stagger'' or ''shear''. Some open \u03b2-sheets are very curved and fold over on themselves (as in the [[SH3 domain]]) or form horseshoe shapes (as in the [[ribonuclease inhibitor]]). Open \u03b2-sheets can assemble face-to-face (such as the [[beta-propeller domain|\u03b2-propeller domain]] or [[immunoglobulin fold]]) or edge-to-edge, forming one big \u03b2-sheet.\n\n==Dynamic features==\n\n\u03b2-pleated sheet structures are made from extended \u03b2-strand polypeptide chains, with strands linked to their neighbours by [[hydrogen bonds]]. Due to this extended backbone conformation, \u03b2-sheets resist [[stretching]]. \u03b2-sheets in proteins may carry out [[low-frequency collective motion in proteins and DNA|low-frequency]] accordion-like motion as observed by the [[Raman spectroscopy]]<ref name=\"pmid7115900\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Painter PC, Mosher LE, Rhoads C | title = Low-frequency modes in the Raman spectra of proteins | journal = Biopolymers | volume = 21 | issue = 7 | pages = 1469\u201372 | date = July 1982 | pmid = 7115900 | doi = 10.1002/bip.360210715 }}</ref> and analyzed with the quasi-continuum model.<ref name=\"pmid4052563\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chou KC | title = Low-frequency motions in protein molecules.

In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the [[Raurici]] at the site of ''Basel-Gasfabrik'', to the northwest of the Old City, likely identical with the town of ''Arialbinnum'' mentioned on the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]''.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Teuteberg: ''Basler Geschichte,'' p. 49.</ref> The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an ''[[Basel oppidum|oppidum]]'' on the site of [[Basel Minster]], probably in reaction to the [[Gallic War|Roman invasion of Gaul]].\n\nIn [[Roman Gaul]], [[Augusta Raurica]] was established some {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a ''[[castra]]'' (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic ''oppidum''. The city of Basel eventually grew around the ''castra''. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Germania Superior]]. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the ''[[Provincia Maxima Sequanorum]]'' formed by [[Diocletian]].\n\nThe Germanic confederation of the [[Alemanni]] attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the [[Battle of Solicinium]] (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the [[Swiss Plateau]]. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\n\nThe [[Duchy of Alemannia]] fell under [[Francia|Frankish]] rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the [[Bishopric of Basel]]. Based on the evidence of a third ''solidus''{{clarify|date=August 2018}}{{Fix|text=Does this mean a coin worth one third of a solidus?}} with the inscription ''Basilia fit'', Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmb.ch/en/collection/object/basel-kopie-vom-gold-triens-des-muenzmeisters-gunso-anfangs-7-jh-vs.html|title=Basel.

At the partition of the [[Carolingian Empire]], Basel was first given to [[West Francia]], but it passed to [[East Francia]] with the [[treaty of Meerssen]] of 870.\n\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a [[Magyar invasion]] in 917.

Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market.<ref name=\"habicht\"/>\n\nIn 1347, [[Black Death|the plague came to Europe]] but it did not reach Basel until June 1349.

They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors - young orphans - were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the [[1356 Basel earthquake|Basel earthquake of 1356]] which destroyed much of the city along with a [[R\u00f6tteln Castle|number of castles]] in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - BASILEA.png|thumb|right|1493 woodcut of Basle, from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]]]\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known [[Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen]] was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century [[Council of Basel]] (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of [[antipope Felix V]]. In 1459, [[Pope Pius II]] endowed the [[University of Basel]], where such notables as [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Paracelsus]] later taught.

The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after [[Ash Wednesday]] and continuing day and night for exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\n\n[[Basel Tattoo]], founded in 2006 by the local [[Top Secret Drum Corps]], has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the [[Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo|Edinburgh Military Tattoo]].<ref name= \"swissinfo\">[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Basels_tattoo_spins_to_success.html?cid=995834 Basel's tattoo spins to success]. swissinfo.ch, written 2008-7-15, retrieved 2012-7-13</ref> The Basel Tattoo annual parade, with an estimated 125,000 visitors, is considered the largest event in Basel.

It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-[[humanoid]] roles, and the first to have detailed [[martial arts]] and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second edition of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by [[Steve Jackson Games]] as an official [[List of GURPS books|''GURPS'' supplement]] in 1992.\n\nAs [[rabbit]]s, [[player character]]s are faced with dangers mirroring those in the real world. The only true \"[[monster]]s\" in the game are humans, but there are many predators and natural hazards.

Ewalt]], in his book ''Of Dice and Men'', commented that ''Bunnies & Burrows'' \"pushed setting even farther\" than other early RPGs like ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and ''[[En Garde!]]'', as the \"player characters were intelligent rabbits and had to compete for food, avoid predators, and deal with internal warren politics\".<ref name=ODaM>{{cite book | first=David M. | last=Ewalt | authorlink= David M.

In 2010, the Bundaberg Distilling Company was inducted into the [[Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leaders.slq.qld.gov.au/inductees/|title=Hall of Fame|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame]]|publisher=[[State Library of Queensland]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023083836/http://leaders.slq.qld.gov.au/inductees/|archive-date=23 October 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=23 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Queensland State Archives 324 Bundaberg Rum Distillery Burnett River Bundaberg c 1931.png|thumb|left|Bundaberg Rum Distillery, Burnett River, Bundaberg., Circa 1931.]]\nBundaberg Rum originated because the local sugar mills had a problem with what to do with the waste [[molasses]] after the sugar was extracted (it was heavy, difficult to transport and the costs of converting it to stock feed were rarely worth the effort). Sugar men first began to think of the profits that could be made from distilling. The vital meeting was held at the Royal Hotel on 1 August 1885, W M C Hickson served as the chairman, and other notables in attendance included all the big sugar mill owners of that time, W G Farquhar, F L Nott, T Austin, S McDougall, T Penny, S H Bravo and A H Young, all to become the first directors of the Company. They started with a capital of [[pound sterling|\u20a4]]5,000.<ref>{{citation|title=Bundy A Centenary History|first=Keith|last=Dunstan}}</ref>\n\nThe Bundaberg Distilling Company began its operations in 1888.\n\nBundaberg rum was first produced in 1889, production ceased from 1907 to 1914 and from 1936 to 1939 after fires, the second of which caused rum from the factory to spill into the nearby [[Burnett River]].<ref>{{citation|first=Julia|last=Robinson|title=Voices of Queensland: words from the sunshine state|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2001}}</ref>\n\nChristsen Pty Ltd operated their own Bundaberg Rum bottling plant in Bourbong Street, Bundaberg at the rear of their large grocery and hardware business in the centre of town. The spirit was sold at UP and OP strength from their business. Spokesperson for the original family, Mr Rod Patch, recalls the origins of the shape of the current \"Bundy Bottle\". It originated from the Bushells Coffee Chicory bottle that Bundaberg residents sold to his grandfather at the firm for one penny a bottle, after which they were washed and filled with the spirit. The shape remains the same but the capacity has been increased to the current 700ml. Patch's great grandfather, Hans Truval Christsen, a  Danish immigrant from Copenhagen and his son Frederick Christsen had an employment policy of employing staff from [[the Salvation Army]] faith in the rum bottling process as they were less likely to be tempted to sample the spirit. The Christsen family supported settlement farming families through hard times and these good deeds were acknowledged with the naming of Christsen Park at Bargara Beach.\n\n[[File:BundabergRumFactory.jpg|thumb|right|Bundaberg Rum Factory, Circa 2014.]]\nIn 1961, the company introduced the [[polar bear]] as its unusual choice of mascot, to imply that the rum could ward off the coldest chill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bundabergrum.com.au/explore/distillery/chapter/03 |title=Bundaberg Rum website \u2013 history section |accessdate=26 March 2008 |work=Bundaberg Rum website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923195147/http://www.bundabergrum.com.au/explore/distillery/chapter/03 |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the Bundaberg Rum company and [[Distillation|distillery]] were sold to British company [[Diageo]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.just-drinks.com/news/diageo-acquires-bundaberg-rum-from-bundaberg-sugar-group-ltd_id78650.aspx |title=Diageo acquires Bundaberg Rum from Bundaberg Sugar Group Ltd|author=Diageo PLC|publisher=Just-Drinks|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213221626/http://www.just-drinks.com/news/diageo-acquires-bundaberg-rum-from-bundaberg-sugar-group-ltd_id78650.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014|date=6 December 2000}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a decision by Diageo to relocate the bottling operations of Queensland's iconic drink, \"Bundaberg Rum\", to the western Sydney suburb of [[Huntingwood, New South Wales|Huntingwood]] resulted in local job losses in the city that bears its name.

The first [[trail|path]] to the summit was built at the same time as the observatory and was designed to allow [[pony|ponies]] to carry up supplies, with a maximum gradient of one in five.<ref name=\"Roy\"/> The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular, all the more so after the arrival of the [[West Highland Railway]] in Fort William in 1894.<ref name=\"MacLennan\"/> Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a [[rack railway]] to the summit, none of which came to fruition.<ref name=\"Hodgkiss 117\"/>\n\nIn 2000, the Ben Nevis Estate, comprising all of the south side of the mountain including the summit, was bought by the Scottish conservation charity the [[John Muir Trust]].\n\nIn 2016, the height of Ben Nevis was officially remeasured to be 1344.527m by [[Ordnance Survey]]. The height of Ben Nevis will therefore be shown on new Ordnance Survey maps as {{convert|1,345|m|ft|0|adj=ri0}} instead of the now obsolete value of {{convert|1,344|m|ft|0|adj=ri0}}.<ref name=\"OS revision\"/>\n\n== Ascent routes ==\n[[File:Path Up Ben Nevis.JPG|thumb|left|An old postcard view showing the path up Ben Nevis]]\nThe 1883 Pony Track to the summit (also known as the ''Ben Path'', the ''Mountain Path'' or the ''Tourist Route'') remains the simplest and most popular route of ascent. It begins at [[Achintee, Fort William|Achintee]] on the east side of Glen Nevis about {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Fort William town centre, at around 20 metres above sea level. Bridges from the Visitor Centre and the [[youth hostel]] now allow access from the west side of Glen Nevis.<ref name=\"OS\"/><ref name=\"Butterfield 97\">Butterfield, ''The High Mountains'', p. 97</ref> The path climbs steeply to the saddle by Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe (colloquially known as the 'Halfway Lake') at 570&nbsp;m, then ascends the remaining 700 metres up the stony west flank of Ben Nevis in a series of zig-zags. The path is regularly maintained but running water, uneven rocks and loose scree make it hazardous and slippery in places. Thanks to the zig-zags, the path is not unusually steep apart from in the initial stages, but inexperienced walkers should be aware that the descent is relatively arduous and wearing on the knees.\n\n[[File:Carn Mor Dearg arete.jpg|thumb|right|The CMD Ar\u00eate under deep snow in spring, from the summit of [[C\u00e0rn M\u00f2r Dearg]]]]\nA route popular with experienced [[hillwalking|hillwalkers]] starts at Torlundy, a few miles north-east of Fort William on the [[A82 road]], and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends C\u00e0rn M\u00f2r Dearg and continues along the C\u00e0rn M\u00f2r Dearg Ar\u00eate (\"CMD Ar\u00eate\") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a [[head for heights]].<ref>Butterfield, ''The High Mountains'', p. 98</ref> In common with other approaches on this side of the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.<ref name=\"Butterfield 97\"/>\n\nIt is also possible to climb Ben Nevis from the Nevis Gorge car park at Steal at the head of the road up Glen Nevis, either by the south-east ridge or via the summit of C\u00e0rn Dearg (south-west). These routes require mild scrambling, are shorter and steeper than the Pony Track, and tend only to be used by experienced hill walkers.\n\n[[File:Ben Nevis summit.jpg|thumb|left|The summit survival shelter (centre) atop the ruined observatory.

Classic rock routes include ''Rubicon Wall'' on Observatory Buttress (Severe)&nbsp;\u2013 whose second ascent in 1937, when it was considered the hardest route on the mountain, is described by [[W.

Work to upgrade the mountain track started in November 2015 after two contracts were awarded to McGowan Ltd. & Cairngorm Wilderness Contracts. Both contractors immediately started bagging stone from high up Ben Nevis to be brought down to by helicopter to replace crumbling steps and stabilise eroding parts of the path. The project will eventually upgrade 3.5&nbsp;km of the mountain track from the starting point at Achintee all the way up to John's Wall; this year the maintenance was focused on a difficult middle section which was most in need of attention. After six months of hard work and battling with the weather, the contractors have now upgraded 1&nbsp;km of the mountain track which is roughly 30% of the overall maintenance this project will carry out. The next contracted works will resume towards the end of September, after the Ben Nevis Race, for stage two of the project.\n\nVolunteer effort has already been a huge help and will continue to be a large contributing factor to the overall upgrade of the mountain track. Nevis Landscape Partnership are working closely with National Trust for Scotland to run [http://www.nts.org.uk/thistlecamps/ Thistle Camp Working Holidays] which will focus on much-needed maintenance on the first section of the Ben Nevis footpath and allow outdoor enthusiasts to actively be a part of maintaining and protecting the United Kingdom's highest mountain for this generation and many more to come.[[File:Allt a' Mhuilinn.JPG|thumb|left|Path to the CIC Hut alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn]]\n\n== Ben Nevis Distillery ==\nThe [[Ben Nevis Distillery]] is a [[single malt Scotch|single malt whisky]] distillery at the foot of the mountain, near Victoria Bridge to the north of Fort William.

During this period, rum was cheaply made and not considered a refined drink, and rarely sold in upmarket taverns.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Facundo began attempting to \"tame\" rum by isolating a proprietary strain of yeast still used in Bacardi production. This yeast gives Bacardi rum its flavour profile. After experimenting with several techniques he hit upon filtering the rum through charcoal, which removed impurities. In addition to this, Facundo aged the rum in white oak barrels, which had the effect of mellowing the drink. The final product was the first clear, or \"white\" rum in the world.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nMoving from the experimental stage to a more commercial endeavour, he and his brother Jos\u00e9 set up a [[Santiago de Cuba]] distillery they bought in 1862, which housed a [[still]] made of copper and [[cast iron]].

In his book ''Bacardi, The Hidden War'', [[Hernando Calvo Ospina]] outlines the political element to the family's money. Ospina describes how the Bacardi family and the company left Cuba after the Castro regime confiscated the company's Cuban assets on 15 October 1960, particularly nationalizing and banning all private property on the island as well as all bank accounts. However, due to concerns over the previous Cuban leader, [[Fulgencio Batista]], the company had started foreign branches a few years before the revolution; the company moved the ownership of its trademarks, assets and proprietary formulas out of the country to the Bahamas prior to the revolution and also built plants in Puerto Rico and Mexico after Prohibition to save import taxes on rum being imported to the United States. This helped the company survive after the communist government confiscated all Bacard\u00ed assets in the country without any compensation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bacardi: The Hidden War|author=Hernando Calvo Ospina|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2002 |ISBN=978-0745318738}}</ref>\n\nOspina also explains the close ties Bacard\u00ed family members had to the US political elite as well as to organizations of state such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. The family funded various [[Cuban exile]] organizations, such as [[CANF]].\n\nMore recently, Bacardi lawyers were influential in the drafting of the 1996 [[Helms-Burton Act]], which sought to extend the scope of the [[United States embargo against Cuba]].<ref>[http://library.thinkquest.org/18355/the_helms-burton_act.html The Helms-Burton Act] from thinkquest.org</ref> In 1999, [[Otto Reich]], a lobbyist in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] on behalf of Bacardi, drafted section 211 of the [[Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act, FY1999]] ({{USPL|105|277}}), a bill that became known as the Bacardi Act. Section 211 denied trademark protection to products of Cuban businesses expropriated after the Cuban revolution, a provision sought by Bacardi. The act was aimed primarily at the [[Havana Club]] brand in the United States. The brand was created by the Jos\u00e9 Arechabala S.A. and nationalised without compensation in the Cuban revolution, the Arechabala family left Cuba and stopped producing rum. They therefore allowed the US trademark registration for \"Havana Club\" to lapse in 1973. Taking advantage of the lapse, the Cuban government registered the mark in the United States in 1976.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite news | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/incoming/article1941675.html | title=Havana Club rum dispute isn\u2019t over yet | work=Miami Herald | date=20 July 2012 | accessdate=11 January 2015 | author=Whitefield|first = Mimi}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Ann Louise Bardach |title= Cuba Confidential |publisher= Penguin Books |date=2002 |page=131}}</ref> This new law was drafted to invalidate the trademark registration.

The main brand of rum in Cuba is [[Havana Club]], produced by a company that was confiscated and nationalized by the government during the revolution. Bacardi later bought the brand from the original owners, the Arechabala family. The Cuban government, in partnership with the French company [[Pernod Ricard]], sells its Havana Club products internationally, except in the United States and its territories. Bacardi created its own line of Havana Club rum based on the original recipe from the Arechabala family, manufactures it in Puerto Rico, and sells it in the United States. Bacardi continues to fight in the courts, attempting to legalize their own [[Havana Club (Bacardi)|Havana Club]] trademark outside the United States.<ref>[http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=55761&ct_id=1 Caribbean Business: Bacardi wins round in Havana Club fight] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109025423/http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=55761&ct_id=1 |date=9 January 2015 }} Retrieved 30 May 2011.</ref> Drinks now made in the former Cuban Bacardi distillery are sold in Cuba under the name Caney.\n\nDespite having no production facilities in Cuba today, Bacardi in the UK has recently decided to re-emphasize its Cuban heritage, primarily for commercial reasons. Facing increased competition in the rum market from the now international brand Havana Club, the company concluded that it was important for sales to associate its rum with Cuba. TV advertisements with slogans of \"Welcome to the Latin Quarter\" are but one example of this. In 1998, under the distinctive bat logo, the phrase \"company founded in Santiago de Cuba in 1862\" was added.\n\nBacardi has faced criticism and legal problems for supposedly attempting to encourage consumers to believe that they were purchasing rum made in Cuba, rather than just marking its heritage. Bacardi adverts in Spain, since 1966, had described a popular combination of rum and Coke as \"rum and coke\". However, after 1998, it began to describe the drink as [[Cuba Libre]]&nbsp;\u2013 literally translated as \"Free Cuba\", which is the original name of the drink and what it is mostly called in Latin America. In this instance, Bacardi faced a legal ruling from the Spanish Association of Advertising Users which forced the company to stop the advert. They concluded that it could \"mislead the viewer as to the true nature of the product\", as the advert contained so much Caribbean imagery, one might conclude it came from Cuba.<ref>Ospina (2002), p.&nbsp;79.</ref>{{Clarify|date=January 2013|reason=Who is the Spanish Association of Advertising Users, and how do they have the power of law?

He lived at [[Finca Vig\u00eda]], in the small town of San Francisco de Paula, located very close to Bacardi's [[Modelo Brewery]] for Hatuey Beer in [[Cotorro, Havana]].\n\nIn 1954, Compa\u00f1\u00eda Ron Bacardi S.A. threw Hemingway a party when he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] \u2013 soon after the publication of his novel ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' (1952) \u2013 in which he honored the company by mentioning its Hatuey beer. Hemingway also mentioned Bacardi and Hatuey in his novels ''[[To Have and Have Not]]'' (1937) and ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1940). [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]] wrote an account of the festivities for the periodical ''Cicl\u00f3n'', titled \"El Viejo y la Marca\" (\"The Old Man and the Brand\", a play on \"El Viejo y el Mar\", the book's [[Spanish language|Spanish]] title). In his account he described how \"on one side there was a wooden stage with two streamers&nbsp;\u2013 Hatuey beer and Bacardi rum&nbsp;\u2013 on each end and a Cuban flag in the middle. Next to the stage was a bar, at which people crowded, ordering daiquiris and beer, all free.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cabrera Infante|first=Guillermo|title=El viejo y la marca|journal=Cicl\u00f3n|year=1956}}</ref> A sign at the event read \"Bacardi rum welcomes the author of ''The Old Man and the Sea''\".\n\nIn his article \"The Old Man and the Daiquiri\", Wayne Curtis writes about how Hemingway's \"home bar also held a bottle of Bacardi rum\".

Exiled Cuban architect Enrique Gutierrez created a building that was hurricane-proof, using a system of steel cables and pulleys which allow the building to move slightly in the event of a strong shock. The steel cables are anchored into the bedrock and extend through marble-covered shafts up to the top floor, where they are led over large pulleys. Outside, on both sides of the eight-story building, more than 28,000 tiles painted and fired by Brazilian artist Francisco Brennard, depicting abstract blue flowers, were placed on the walls according to the artist's exact specifications.\n\nIn 1972, the Company commissioned the square building in the plaza. Architect Ignacio Carrera-Justiz used cantilevered construction, a style invented by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Wright observed how well trees with taproots withstood hurricane-force winds. The building, raised 47 feet off the ground around a central core, features four massive walls, made of sections of inch-thick hammered glass mural tapestries, designed and manufactured in France. The design came from a painting by German artist Johannes M. Dietz.\n\nIn 2006, Bacardi USA leased a 15-story headquarters complex in [[Coral Gables, Florida]].

Both Auxiliaries and Black and Tans had Irish members.}}</ref><ref>Padraig Og O Ruairc, Blood on the Banner, The Republican Struggle in Clare, pp. 332\u201333</ref>  Their role was to help the RIC maintain control and fight the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), the army of the [[Irish Republic]]. The nickname \"Black and Tans\" arose from the colours of the improvised uniforms they initially wore, composed of mixed [[khaki]] British Army and [[rifle green]] RIC uniform parts. The Black and Tans became known for their attacks on civilians and civilian property.\n\nThe Black and Tans were sometimes confused with the [[Auxiliary Division]], a [[counter-insurgency]] unit of the RIC made up of former British officers.<ref>O'Connell, T.

The issue of Home Rule was shelved with the outbreak of [[World War I]], and in 1916 [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] staged the [[Easter Rising]] against British rule in an attempt to establish a republic. Growing support amongst the Irish populace for the republican [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] political party saw it win 73 out of 105 seats in the [[Irish general election, 1918]].  On 21 January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in established themselves as the [[First D\u00e1il]], which then declared an independent [[Irish Republic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/about/history/|title=History, Houses of the Oireachtas|first=Houses of the|last=Oireachtas|website=www.oireachtas.ie|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref> They also declared the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) the official army of the state, which in the same month began the [[Irish War of Independence]].

There was no shortage of recruits, many of them unemployed First World War army veterans, and by November 1921 about 9,500 men had joined. This sudden influx of men led to a shortage of RIC uniforms, and the new recruits were issued with [[khaki]] army uniforms (usually only trousers) and dark green RIC or blue [[British police]] surplus tunics, caps and belts. These uniforms differentiated them from the British Army and the regular RIC, and gave rise to the force's nickname: Christopher O'Sullivan wrote in the ''[[Limerick Echo]]'' on 25 March 1920 that, meeting a group of recruits on a train at [[Limerick Junction]], the attire of one reminded him of the [[Scarteen]] [[fox hunting|Hunt]], whose  \"Black and Tans\" nickname derived from the colouration of its [[Kerry Beagle]]s.<ref name=\"Spellissy1998\">{{cite book| last = Spellissy| first = S\u00e9an| title = The history of Limerick City| date = December 1998| publisher = Celtic Bookshop| isbn = 978-0-9534683-0-0| pages = 87\u201388 }}<!--| accessdate = 9 August 2010--></ref> Ennis comedian [[Mike Nono]] elaborated the joke in Limerick's Theatre Royal, and the nickname soon took hold,<ref name=\"Spellissy1998\" /> persisting even after the men received full RIC uniforms.

The first men arrived on 25 March 1920. The British government also raised another unit, the [[Auxiliary Division]] of the constabulary, known as the Auxiliaries or Auxies, consisting of ex-army officers. The Black and Tans aided the Auxiliaries in the British government's attempts to break both the IRA and the D\u00e1il. The Blacks and Tans were meant to back up the RIC in the struggle against the IRA, playing a defensive-reactive role whereas the role of the \"Auxies\" were those of heavily armed, mobile units meant for offensive operations in the Irish countryside intended to hunt down and destroy IRA units. At least part of the infamy of the Blacks and Tans is undeserved as many of the war crimes attributed to the Blacks and Tans were actually the work of the \"Auxies\".<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  Spain \n  | first = Adam\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Review of ''The Black and Tans'' by DM Leeson\n  | work =\n  | publisher = ''Irish Independent''\n  | date=17 September 2011| url = http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/review-history-the-black-and-tans-by-dm-leeson-26772652.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2015-11-29}}</ref>\n\n==Conduct==\n{{See also |Timeline of the Irish War of Independence}}\n\n[[File:Outside the London and North Western Hotel in Dublin, April 21, 1921.jpg|thumb|A group of Black and Tans and Auxiliaries outside the London and North Western Hotel in Dublin following an attack by the IRA, April 1921]]\n\nTemporary Constables were paid the relatively good wage of 10 [[shilling]]s (half a [[Pound sterling#Pre-decimal|pound]]) a day, plus full board and lodging.

He was killed during an IRA attack on the RIC barracks in [[Rathmore, County Kerry|Rathmore]], County Kerry, on 11 July 1920.\n\nThe Black and Tans were not subject to strict discipline in their first months and, as a result, their deaths at the hands of the IRA in 1920 were often repaid with arbitrary reprisals against the civilian population. In the summer of 1920, the Black and Tans burned and sacked many small towns and villages in Ireland, beginning with [[Tuam]] in [[County Galway]] in July 1920 and also including [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], [[Balbriggan]], [[Knockcroghery]], [[Thurles]] and [[Templemore]] amongst many others. In November 1920, the Tans \"besieged\" [[Tralee]] in revenge for the IRA abduction and killing of two local RIC men. They closed all the businesses in the town, let no food in for a week and shot dead three local civilians. On 14 November, the Tans were suspected of abducting and murdering a Roman Catholic priest, Father [[Michael Griffin (Irish priest)|Michael Griffin]], in [[Galway]]. His body was found in a bog in [[Barna]] a week later. From October 1920 to July 1921, the Galway region was \"remarkable in many ways\", most notably the level of police brutality towards suspected IRA members, which was far above the norm in the rest of Ireland.<ref name=\"Augusteijn pages 938-940\"/>   On the night of 11 December 1920, they sacked [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Burning of Cork|destroying a large part of the city centre]].\n\nIn January 1921, the British Labour Commission produced a report on the situation in Ireland which was highly critical of the government's security policy. It said the government, in forming the Black and Tans, had \"liberated forces which it is not at present able to dominate\". However, since 29 December 1920, the British government had sanctioned \"official reprisals\" in Ireland \u2013 usually meaning burning property of IRA men and their suspected sympathisers. Taken together with an increased emphasis on discipline in the RIC, this helped to curb the random atrocities the Black and Tans committed since March 1920 for the remainder of the war, if only because reprisals were now directed from above rather than being the result of a spontaneous desire for revenge.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2017}}\n\nMany of the activities popularly attributed to the Black and Tans may have been committed by the [[Auxiliary Division]]; For instance, [[Tom\u00e1s Mac Curtain]], the Mayor of Cork, was assassinated in March 1920 by local RIC men under the command of an Inspector General who had been a 'plague on the local Catholic population' and the shooting dead of 13 civilians at [[Croke Park]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] was supposedly carried out by the regular RIC, although a small detachment of Auxiliaries were also present. Most Republicans did not make a distinction, and \"Black and Tans\" was often used as a catch-all term for all police groups.\n\n===Government policy and reaction===\nThe actions of the Black and Tans alienated public opinion in both Ireland and Great Britain. Their violent tactics encouraged the Irish public to increase their covert support of the IRA, while the British public pressed for a move towards a peaceful resolution. [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Edward Wood]] MP, better known as the future Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, rejected force and urged the British government to make an offer to the Irish \"conceived on the most generous lines\".<ref>[[Frederick Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]], ''Halifax'' (Hamish Hamilton, 1965), p. 122.</ref> Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]] MP, another future Foreign Secretary, was also horrified at the tactics being used. [[Lionel Curtis]], writing in the imperialist journal ''[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]]'', wrote: \"If the British Commonwealth can only be preserved by such means, it would become a negation of the principle for which it has stood\".<ref>Lionel Curtis, ''The Round Table'', Vol. XI, No. 43 (June 1921), p. 505.</ref> The [[George V of the United Kingdom|King]], senior Anglican bishops, MPs from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties, [[Oswald Mosley]], [[Jan Smuts]], the [[Trades Union Congress]] and parts of the press were increasingly critical of the actions of the Black and Tans. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] said of the British peace offer: \"It is not fear of losing more lives that has compelled a reluctant offer from England but it is the shame of any further imposition of agony upon a people that loves liberty above everything else\".<ref>Lawrence James, ''The Rise and Fall of the British Empire'' (Abacus, 1998), p. 384.</ref>\n\nAbout 7,000 Black and Tans served in Ireland in 1920\u201322. More than one-third left the service before they were disbanded along with the rest of the RIC in 1922, an extremely high wastage rate, and well over half received government pensions. A total of 404 members of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] died in the conflict and more than 600 were wounded but it is not clear how many of these were regular RIC men and how many were Black and Tans or Auxiliaries.\n\nThose who returned to civilian life sometimes had problems re-integrating. At least two former Black and Tans were hanged for murder in Britain and another wanted for murder committed suicide before the police could arrest him.<ref>Bennett, Richard ''The Black and Tans''(London 1959), p. 222</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDue to the ferocity of the Tans' behaviour in Ireland and the numerous [[war crimes]] they committed, feelings continue to run high regarding their actions. \"Black and Tan\" or \"Tan\" remains a pejorative term for the British in Ireland{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}, and the reputation of the Tans is still hated in Ireland. The term can still stir bad reactions because of their remembered brutality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/nike-forced-to-run-like-hell-away-over-black-and-tan-trainer-branding-187151.html|title=Nike forced to run like hell away over Black and Tan trainer branding|date=15 March 2012|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref> One of the best known Irish Republican songs is [[Dominic Behan]]'s \"[[Come out Ye Black and Tans]]\".

The city of Heidelberg had begun to install [[coal-gas]] street lighting, and so the university laid gas lines to the new laboratory.\n\nThe designers of the building intended to use the gas not just for illumination, but also in burners for laboratory operations.  For any burner lamp, it was desirable to maximize the temperature and minimize luminosity.  However, existing laboratory burner lamps left much to be desired not just in terms of the heat of the flame, but also regarding economy and simplicity.\n\nWhile the building was still under construction in late 1854, Bunsen suggested certain design principles to the university's mechanic, [[Peter Desaga]], and asked him to construct a prototype. Similar principles had been used in an earlier burner design by [[Michael Faraday]], as well as in a device patented in 1856 by the gas engineer R. W. Elsner. The Bunsen/Desaga design succeeded in generating a hot, sootless, non-luminous flame by mixing the gas with air in a controlled fashion before combustion.  Desaga created adjustable slits for air at the bottom of the cylindrical burner, with the flame igniting at the top.  By the time the building opened early in 1855 Desaga had made 50 burners for Bunsen's students.  Two years later Bunsen published a description, and many of his colleagues soon adopted the design.  Bunsen burners are now used in laboratories all around the world.<ref>{{cite book| author = Ihde, Aaron John | title = The development of modern chemistry| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&pg=PA233| date = 1984| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-64235-2| pages = 233\u2013236 }}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:Bunsen_burner_flame_types.jpg|thumb|left|Bunsen burner flames depend on air flow in the throat holes (on the burner side, not the needle valve for gas flow): 1. air hole closed (safety flame used for lighting or default), 2. air hole slightly open, 3. air hole half-open, 4. air hole fully open (roaring blue flame).]]\nThe device in use today safely burns a continuous stream of a flammable [[gas]] such as [[natural gas]] (which is principally [[methane]]) or a [[liquefied petroleum gas]] such as [[propane]], [[butane]], or a mixture of both.\n\nThe hose barb is connected to a gas nozzle on the laboratory bench with rubber tubing.  Most laboratory benches are equipped with multiple gas nozzles connected to a central gas source, as well as vacuum, [[nitrogen]], and steam nozzles.  The gas then flows up through the base through a small hole at the bottom of the barrel and is directed upward. There are open slots in the side of the tube bottom to admit air into the stream using the [[Venturi effect]], and the gas burns at the top of the tube once ignited by a flame or spark.  The most common methods of lighting the burner are using a [[match]] or a [[spark lighter]].\n\nThe amount of air mixed with the gas stream affects the completeness of the [[combustion]] reaction.  Less air yields an incomplete and thus cooler reaction, while a gas stream well mixed with air provides oxygen in a [[stoichiometric]] amount and thus a complete and hotter reaction.  The air flow can be controlled by opening or closing the slot openings at the base of the barrel, similar in function to the [[Choke valve|choke]] in a [[carburettor]].\n\n[[File:Laboratory tripod with other lab equipments.jpg|thumb|A Bunsen burner situated below a [[Tripod (laboratory)|tripod]]]]\nIf the collar at the bottom of the tube is adjusted so more air can mix with the gas before combustion, the flame will burn hotter, appearing blue as a result.  If the holes are closed, the gas will only mix with ambient air at the point of combustion, that is, only after it has exited the tube at the top.  This reduced mixing produces an incomplete reaction, producing a cooler but brighter yellow, which is often called the \"safety flame\" or \"[[luminous flame]]\".  The yellow flame is [[luminosity|luminous]] due to small [[soot]] particles in the flame, which are heated to [[incandescence]]. The yellow flame is considered \"dirty\" because it leaves a layer of carbon on whatever it is heating.  When the burner is regulated to produce a hot, blue flame, it can be nearly invisible against some backgrounds. The hottest part of the flame is the tip of the inner flame, while the coolest is the whole inner flame. Increasing the amount of fuel gas flow through the tube by opening the [[needle valve]] will increase the size of the flame.  However, unless the airflow is adjusted as well, the flame temperature will decrease because an increased amount of gas is now mixed with the same amount of air, starving the flame of oxygen.\n\nGenerally, the burner is placed underneath a [[Tripod (laboratory)|laboratory tripod]], which supports a [[Beaker (glassware)|beaker]] or other container. The burner will often be placed on a suitable [[heatproof mat]] to protect the laboratory bench surface.\n\nA Bunsen burner is also regularly used in microbiology labs to work sterile. The burner is placed on the bench (working surface in the lab), where it creates an aseptic region, in which microbiologist can work<ref>Youtube movie to show proper use of bunsen burner https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRadiLXkqoU.</ref><ref>PDF on how to work in the lab  http://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/safety/sop/SOP_Spreading_Bacterial_Cultures.pdf.</ref>\n\n==Variants==\nOther burners based on the same principle exist. The most important alternatives to the Bunsen burner are:\n* [[Teclu burner]] \u2013 The lower part of its tube is conical, with a round screw nut below its base. The gap, set by the distance between the nut and the end of the tube, regulates the influx of the air in a way similar to the open slots of the Bunsen burner. The Teclu burner provides better mixing of air and fuel and can achieve higher flame temperatures than the Bunsen burner.<ref>{{cite journal|title =  Ein neuer Laboratoriums-Brenner|first = Nicolae|last = Teclu|authorlink = Nicolae Teclu|journal = [[J.

They, along with other large whales were mythologized and indistinguishable from sea monsters. Even after the first specimens were described, the blue whale went by many names and scientists often described their specimens as new species. Descriptions and illustrations were inaccurate. The taxonomy was eventually resolved, but many mysteries remained.<ref name=Bortolotti /><ref name=small />\n\nThe blue whale rose from relative obscurity in the 1970s, after the release of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.<ref name=Bortolotti />\n\nToday, the blue whale is renowned for being the largest animal ever to have lived. In part because of its legendary status, many misconceptions still exist. For example, its size is often exaggerated. Many popular sources give the maximum length as {{convert|110|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} or more. While such lengths were reported in the whaling records, they were not scientifically verified and were probably exaggerated. Virtually all books and articles that mention the blue whale claim that it can reach {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}. This is probably true (the largest verified specimen was {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|disp=comma}}<ref name=pop /> but is highly misleading as the average size is much smaller.<ref name=Bortolotti /><ref>\"Sizing ocean giants: patterns of intraspecific size variation in marine megafauna\" by Craig R.

The Antarctic blue whale population is growing at the relatively rapid rate of about 7.3% per year, but it was hunted to such a low level that it remains at a tiny fraction of pre-whaling numbers.<ref name=Ant /> The global population still requires protection, but it is not in immediate danger of extinction.<ref name=Bortolotti />\n\nOther myths and misconceptions include that the blue whale's arteries can be swum through, that the heartbeat can be heard from 19 miles away, and that the blue whale penis is 16 feet long.<ref name=Bortolotti />\n\n== Museums ==\n[[File:Blue-Whale-Balaenoptera musculus-NHM-2017-PNG-001.png|thumb|The blue whale skeleton in the [[Natural History Museum, London]]]]\n\nThe [[Natural History Museum, London#Major specimens and exhibits|Natural History Museum]] in London contains a famous mounted skeleton and life-size model of a blue whale, which were both the first of their kind in the world, but have since been replicated at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].

Shortly after coming to power in November 1917, the party changed its name to the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (\u0420\u041a\u041f(\u0431)) and was generally known as the Communist Party after that point. However, it was not until 1952 that the party formally dropped the word \"Bolshevik\" from its name. See [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] article for the timeline of name changes.}} The Bolsheviks, or Reds, came to power in Russia during the [[October Revolution]] phase of the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and founded the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR). With the Reds defeating the [[White movement|Whites]] and others during the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917\u20131922, the RSFSR became the chief constituent of the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) in December 1922.\n\nThe Bolsheviks, founded by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Alexander Bogdanov]], were by 1905 a major organization consisting primarily of workers under a democratic internal hierarchy governed by the principle of [[democratic centralism]], who considered themselves the leaders of the revolutionary [[proletariat|working class]] of Russia. Their beliefs and practices were often referred to as [[Bolshevism]].\n\n== History of the split ==\n{{Marxism\u2013Leninism sidebar|Related}}\n[[File:Kustodiev The Bolshevik.jpg|left|thumb|''Bolshevik'', [[Boris Kustodiev]], 1920]]\nIn the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|2nd Congress of the RSDLP]] held in Brussels and London during August 1903, Lenin and [[Julius Martov]] disagreed over the membership rules. Lenin wanted members \"who recognise the Party Programme and support it by material means<ref>{{cite book|last =Service|first =Robert|title=Lenin : a biography |date=2010|publisher=Pan|location=London|isbn = 978-0-33051838-3 | page = 154}}</ref> and by personal participation in one of the party's organisations\". Martov suggested \"by regular personal assistance under the direction of one of the party's organisations\". Lenin advocated limiting party membership to a smaller core of active members as opposed to \"[[Card-carrying Communists|card carriers]]\" who might only be active in party branches from time to time or not at all. This active base would develop the cadre, a core of \"[[professional revolutionaries]]\", consisting of loyal communists who would spend most of their time organising the party toward a mass revolutionary party capable of leading a [[Proletarian revolution|workers' revolution]] against the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsarist]] autocracy.\n\nA main source of the factions could be directly attributed to Lenin's steadfast opinion and unwillingness to \"bear opinions which were contrary to his own\".{{Sfn | Shub | 1976 | p =76}}{{Attribution needed|date=November 2015}} It was obvious at early stages in Lenin's revolutionary practices that he would not be willing to concede on any party policy that conflicted with his own predetermined ideas. It was the loyalty that he had to his own self-envisioned utopia that caused the party split. Lenin was seen even by fellow party members as being so narrow minded that he believed that there were only two types of people: \"Friend and enemy\u2014those who followed him, and all the rest\".{{Sfn | Pipes | 1995 | p = 104}} [[Leon Trotsky]], one of Lenin's fellow revolutionaries (though they had differing views as to how the revolution and party should be handled), compared Lenin in 1904 to the French revolutionary [[Maximilien Robespierre]].{{Sfn | Pipes | 1995 | p = 104}} Lenin's view of politics as verbal and ideological warfare and his inability to accept criticism even if it came from his own dedicated followers was the reason behind this accusation.\n\nThe root of the split was a book titled ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'' that Lenin wrote while serving a sentence of exile. In Germany, the book was published in 1902. In Russia, strict censorship outlawed its publication and distribution.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1995 | p = 106}} One of the main points of Lenin's writing was that a revolution can only be achieved by the strong leadership of one person (or of a very select few people) over the masses. After the proposed revolution had successfully overthrown the government, this individual leader must release power to allow socialism to fully encompass the nation. Lenin also wrote that revolutionary leaders must dedicate their entire lives to the cause in order for it to be successful. Lenin said that if professional revolutionaries did not maintain control over the workers, then they would lose sight of the party's objective and adopt opposing beliefs, even abandon the revolution entirely.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1995 | p = 106}} Lenin's view of a socialist intelligentsia showed that he was not a complete supporter of Marxist theory, which also created some party unrest. For example, Lenin agreed with the Marxist idea of eliminating social classes, but in his utopian society there would still be visible distinctions between those in politics and the common worker. Most party members considered unequal treatment of workers immoral and were loyal to the idea of a completely [[classless society]], therefore Lenin's variations caused the party internal dissonance. Although the party split of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks would not become official until 1903, the differences originally began to surface with the publication of ''What Is To Be Done?''. Through the influence of the book, Lenin also undermined another group of reformers known as \"Economists\", who were pushing for economic reform while wanting to leave the government relatively unchanged and who failed to recognize the importance of uniting the working population behind the party's cause.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stalin|first1=J. V.|title=History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Short Course)|date=2016|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329947207|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=L5YkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Formation+of+the+Russian+social-democratic+labor+party.+Appearance+of+the+bolshevik+%26+the+menshevik+groups+within+the+party.+New+York:+International+Publishers.+1939&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim59ve5ujaAhVjk-AKHeyiCIMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOther than the debate between Lenin and  Martov Lenin felt membership should require support of the party program, financial contributions and involvement in a party organization whereas Martov did not see the need for joining Party organizations, internal unrest also rose over the structure that was best suited for Soviet power.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stalin|first1=Joseph|title=History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1939/x01/index.htm|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref> As discussed in ''What Is To Be Done?'', Lenin firmly believed that a rigid political structure was needed to effectively initiate a formal revolution. This idea was met with opposition from his once close followers including Julius Martov, Georgy Plekhanov, Leon Trotsky and Pavel Axelrod.{{Sfn | Tucker | 1975}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}} Plekhanov and Lenin's major dispute arose addressing the topic of nationalizing land or leaving it for private use. Lenin wanted to nationalize to aid in collectivization whereas Plekhanov thought worker motivation would remain higher if individuals were able to maintain their own property. Those who opposed Lenin and wanted to continue on the Marxist path towards complete socialism and disagreed with his strict party membership guidelines became known as \"softs\" while Lenin supporters became known as \"hards\".{{Sfn | Tucker | 1975 | p = xxxviii}}\n\nThe base of active and experienced members would be the recruiting ground for this professional core. Sympathizers would be left outside and the party would be organised based on the concept of [[democratic centralism]]. Martov, until then a close friend of Lenin, agreed with him that the core of the party should consist of professional revolutionaries, but he argued that party membership should be open to sympathizers, revolutionary workers and other fellow travelers.\n\nThe two had disagreed on the issue as early as March\u2013May 1903, but it was not until the Congress that their differences became irreconcilable and split the party.<ref>{{Citation | last = Getzler | first = Israel | author-link = Israel Getzler | title = Martov: A Political Biography of a Russian Social Democrat | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | origyear = 1967 | ISBN = 0-521-52602-7 | p = 78}}.</ref> At first, the disagreement appeared to be minor and inspired by personal conflicts. For example, Lenin's insistence on dropping less active editorial board members from ''[[Iskra]]'' or Martov's support for the Organizing Committee of the Congress which Lenin opposed, The differences quickly grew and the split became irreparable.\n\n=== Origins of the name ===\nThe two factions were originally known as \"hard\" (Lenin's supporters) and \"soft\" (Martov's supporters), but the terminology soon changed to \"Bolsheviks\" and \"Mensheviks\", from the Russian ''bolshinstvo'' (\"majority\") and ''menshinstvo'' (\"minority\").<ref>{{cite book| last = Wilson | first = Edmund|title=To the Finland Station|date=1977|publisher = Fontana |location=London|isbn=0-00-632420-7|page= 402|authorlink = Edmund Wilson}}</ref> On the other hand, Martov's supporters won the vote concerning the question of party membership. Neither Lenin nor Martov had a firm majority throughout the Congress as delegates left or switched sides. At the end, the Congress was evenly split between the two factions.\n\nFrom 1907 on, English language articles sometimes used the term \"Maximalist\" for \"Bolshevik\" and \"Minimalist\" for \"Menshevik\", which proved confusing since there was also a \"Maximalist\" faction within the Russian [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]] in 1904\u20131906 (which after 1906 formed a separate [[Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries Maximalists]]) and then again after 1917.<ref>{{Citation | first = \u00c9tienne | last = Antonelli | title = Bolshevik Russia | publisher = AA Knopf | year = 1920 | others = Charles A.

In 1907, 22% of Bolsheviks were under 20, 37% were 20\u201324 and 16% were 25\u201329. By 1905, 62% of the members were industrial workers (3% of the population in 1897).<ref>{{Citation | first = Abraham | last = Ascher | title = The Revolution of 1905 | page = 4}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Tony | last = Cliff | title = Lenin and the Revolutionary Party | page = 37}}.</ref> 22% of Bolsheviks were gentry (1.7% of the total population), 38% were uprooted peasants, compared with 19% and 26% for the Mensheviks. In 1907, 78.3% of the Bolsheviks were Russian and 10% were Jewish (34% and 20% for the Mensheviks). Total membership was 8,400 in 1905, 13,000 in 1906 and 46,100 by 1907 (8,400, 18,000 and 38,200 for the Mensheviks). By 1910, both factions together had fewer than 10,000 members.<ref>{{Citation | first = Richard | last = Pipes | title = The Russian Revolution | pages = 364\u20135}}.</ref>\n\n=== Beginning of the 1905 Revolution (1903\u20131905) ===\nThe two factions were in a state of flux in 1903\u20131904 with many members changing sides. The founder of Russian Marxism, [[Georgy Plekhanov]], who was at first allied with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, parted ways with them by 1904. Trotsky at first supported the Mensheviks, but he left them in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks. He remained a self-described \"non-factional social democrat\" until August 1917, when he joined Lenin and the Bolsheviks as their positions assembled and he came to believe that Lenin was right on the issue of the party.\n\nAll but one member of the Central Committee were arrested in [[Moscow]] in early 1905. The remaining member, with the power of appointing a new one, was won over by the Bolsheviks.<ref>{{Citation | first = Tim | last = McDaniel | title = Autocracy, capitalism, and revolution in Russia | page = 246}}.</ref>\n\nThe lines between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks hardened in April 1905 when the Bolsheviks held a Bolsheviks-only meeting in London, which they called the 3rd Party Congress. The Mensheviks organised a rival conference and the split was thus formalised.\n\nThe Bolsheviks played a relatively minor role in the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]] and were a minority in the [[Saint Petersburg Soviet]] of Workers' Deputies led by Trotsky. However, the less significant Moscow Soviet was dominated by the Bolsheviks. These [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] became the model for those formed in 1917.\n\n=== Mensheviks (1906\u20131907) ===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}\nAs the Russian Revolution of 1905 progressed, Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and smaller non-Russian social democratic parties operating within the Russian Empire attempted to reunify at the [[4th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|4th (Unification) Congress of the RSDLP]] held in April 1906 at [[Folkets hus]], [[Norra Bantorget]] in [[Stockholm]]. When the Mensheviks struck an alliance with the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Bund]], the Bolsheviks found themselves in a minority.\n\nHowever, all factions retained their respective factional structure and the Bolsheviks formed the [[Bolshevik Centre]], the ''de facto'' governing body of the Bolshevik faction within the RSDLP. At the Fifth Congress held in London in May 1907, the Bolsheviks were in the majority, but the two factions continued functioning mostly independently of each other.\n\n=== Split between Lenin and Bogdanov (1908\u20131910) ===\nTensions had existed between Lenin and [[Alexander Bogdanov]] as early as 1904. Lenin had fallen out with [[Nikolai Valentinov]] after the latter had introduced him to [[Ernst Mach]]'s Empiriocriticism, a viewpoint that Bogdanov had been exploring and developing as Empiriomonism. Having worked as co-editor with Plekhanov on ''Zayra'' he had come to agree with the latter's rejection of Bogdanov's Empiriomonism.<ref name = Left-Bol>{{cite book|last= Biggart|first= John|title= Alexander Bogdanov, left-Bolshevism and the Proletkult 1904\u20131932|date=1989 | publisher =University of East Angla| location= Norwich| asin = B001ON1IY4 | asin-tld=co.uk}}</ref> With the defeat of the revolution in mid-1907 and the adoption of a new, highly restrictive election law, the Bolsheviks began debating whether to boycott the new parliament known as the [[Third Duma]]. Lenin, [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and others argued for participating in the Duma while Bogdanov, [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]] and others argued that the social democratic faction in the Duma should be recalled.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=Bertram D.|title= Three Who Made a Revolution|date=1966|publisher=Penguin|location= London | isbn = 0-14-020783-X|page=410|authorlink=Bertram Wolfe}}</ref> The latter became known as [[recallists]] (\"otzovists\" in Russian). A smaller group within the Bolshevik faction demanded that the RSDLP central committee should give its sometimes unruly Duma faction an ultimatum, demanding complete subordination to all party decisions. This group became known as \"[[ultimatists]]\" and was generally allied with the recallists.\n\nWith most Bolshevik leaders either supporting Bogdanov or undecided by mid-1908 when the differences became irreconcilable, Lenin concentrated on undermining Bogdanov's reputation as a philosopher. In 1909, he published a scathing book of criticism entitled ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]]'' (1909),<ref>{{Citation | place = Moscow | date = May 1909 | publisher = Zveno Publishers | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/ | title = Materialism & Empiriocriticism}}.</ref> assaulting Bogdanov's position and accusing him of philosophical idealism.<ref>{{Citation | first = Alan | last = Woods | title = Bolshevism: The Road to Revolution | publisher = Wellred | year = 1999 | ISBN = 1-900007-05-3 | url = http://www.marxist.com/bolshevism/part3-5.html | chapter = Part Three: The Period of Reaction}}.</ref> In June 1909, Bogdanov proposed the formation of Party Schools as Proletarian Universities at a Bolshevik mini-conference in [[Paris]] organised by the editorial board of the Bolshevik magazine ''[[Proletary]]'' in June 1909. However, this was not accepted and Lenin tried to expel him from the Bolshevik faction.<ref>{{Citation | title = A Documentary History of Communism in Russia | editor-first = Robert V | editor-last = Daniels | publisher = UPNE | year = 1993 | ISBN = 0-87451-616-1 | page = 33}}.</ref> Bogdanov was then involved with setting up [[Vpered]], which ran the Capri Party School from August to December 1909.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Marot | first = John Eric | title = Alexander Bogdanov, Vpered, and the Role of the Intellectual in the Workers' Movement | journal = Russian Review | volume = 49 | issue = 3 (Special Issue on Alexander Bogdanov) | pages = 241\u201364 | publisher = Blackwell | date = July 1990 | jstor = 130152}}</ref>\n\n=== Final attempt at party unity (1910) ===\nWith both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks weakened by splits within their ranks and by [[Tsar]]ist repression, they were tempted to try to re-unite the party. In January 1910, Leninists, recallists and various Menshevik factions held a meeting of the party's Central Committee in Paris. Kamenev and Zinoviev were dubious about the idea, but they were willing to give it a try under pressure from \"conciliator\" Bolsheviks like [[Victor Nogin]].\n\nOne of the more underlying reasons that aided in preventing any reunification of the party was the Russian police. The police were able to infiltrate both parties' inner circles by sending in spies who then reported on the opposing party's intentions and hostilities.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1995 | p =109}}  This allowed the tensions to remain high between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In turn, it prevented them from uniting on common ground which could have possibly sped up the entire revolution.\n\nLenin was firmly opposed to any re-unification, but was outvoted within the Bolshevik leadership. The meeting reached a tentative agreement and one of its provisions made Trotsky's [[Vienna]]-based ''[[Pravda]]'' a party-financed central organ. Kamenev, Trotsky's brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910 when Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations.\n\n=== Forming a separate party (1912) ===\nThe factions permanently broke off relations in January 1912 after the Bolsheviks organised a Bolsheviks-only [[Prague Party Conference]] and formally expelled Mensheviks and recallists from the party. As a result, they ceased to be a faction in the RSDLP and instead declared themselves an independent party, called [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)]] \u2013 or RSDLP(b). Unofficially, the party has been referred to as the [[Bolshevik Party]]. Throughout the century, the party adopted a number of different names. In 1918, RSDLP(b) became [[All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] and remained so until 1925. From 1925\u20131952, the name was [[All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] and from 1952\u20131991 [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].\n\nAs the party split became permanent and politically recognized in 1912 due to an all Bolshevik meeting of Congress, further divisions became evident. One of the most notable differences was how each faction decided to fund its revolution. The Mensheviks decided to fund their revolution through membership dues while Lenin often resorted to much more drastic measures since he required a higher budget.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1995 | p = 108}} One of the common methods the Bolsheviks used was committing bank robberies, one of which in 1907 resulted in the party gaining over 250,000 rubles which is the equivalent of about $125,000.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1995 | p =108}} Bolsheviks were in constant need of money because Lenin practiced his beliefs exercised in his writings that revolutions must be led by individuals who devote their entire life to the cause. To compensate, he awarded them with salaries for their sacrifice and dedication. This measure was taken to help ensure that the revolutionists stayed focused on their duties and motivated them to perform their jobs. Lenin also used the party money to print and copy pamphlets which were distributed in cities and at political rallies in attempts to expand their operations.  This was an obvious difference between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks party beliefs. Both factions also managed to gain funds simply by receiving donations from wealthy supporters.\n\n[[File:Russian Constituent Assembly Election 1917.png|thumb|The elections to the [[Russian Constituent Assembly election, 1917|Russian Constituent Assembly]] took place in November 1917 in which the Bolsheviks came second with 23.9% of the vote and dissolved the Assembly in January 1918<ref>\"[http://www.jewhistory.ort.spb.ru/eng/main/sprav.php?id=1374 The Constituent Assembly]\".</ref>]]\nFurther differences in party agendas became evident as the beginning of [[World War I]] loomed near. [[Joseph Stalin]] was especially eager for the start of the war, hoping that it would turn into a war between classes or essentially a [[Russian Civil War]].{{Sfn | Pipes | 1995 | p = 111}} This desire for war was fueled by Lenin's vision that the workers and peasants would resist joining the war effort and therefore be more compelled to join the socialist movement. Through the increase in support Russia would then be forced to withdraw from the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] in order to resolve her internal conflict. Unfortunately for the Bolsheviks, Lenin's assumptions were incorrect and despite his and the party's attempts to push for a civil war through involvement in two conferences in 1915 and 1916 in Switzerland it remained in the minority in calling for the ceasefire by the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] in World War I.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1995 | p = 111}}\n\t\nAlthough the Bolshevik leadership decided to form a separate party, convincing pro-Bolshevik workers within Russia to follow suit proved difficult. When the first meeting of the Fourth Duma was convened in late 1912, only one out of six Bolshevik deputies, [[Matvei Muranov]] (another one, Roman Malinovsky, was later exposed as an [[Okhrana]] agent), voted to break away from the Menshevik faction within the Duma on 15 December 1912.<ref>{{Citation | first = Robert B | last = McKean | title = St. Petersburg Between the Revolutions: workers and revolutionaries, June 1907 \u2013 February 1917 | place = New Haven | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 1990 | pages = 140\u20131}}.</ref> The Bolshevik leadership eventually prevailed and the Bolsheviks formed their own Duma faction in September 1913.\n\nOne final difference between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks was simply how ferocious and tenacious the party was willing to be in order to achieve its goals. Lenin was open minded to retreating on political ideas if he saw the guarantee of long term gains benefiting the party. This practice was commonly seen trying to recruit peasants and uneducated workers by promising them how glorious life would be after the revolution. His approach was \"land seizure for the peasants and national self-determination for the minorities \u2013 as nothing more than temporary concessions\".{{Sfn | Pipes | 1995 | p = 108}}\n\nIn 1918, the party renamed itself the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at Lenin's suggestion. In 1925, this was changed to All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). At the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]] in 1952 the Bolshevik Party was renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union according to Stalin's suggestion.\n\n== Derogatory usage of \"Bolshevik\" ==\n[[File:Nieder mit dem Bolschewismus.

The [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Poles]] commanded by [[Piotr Dunin]], consisting of some 2000 mercenares and Poles, decisively defeated the 2700 man army of the [[Teutonic Knights]] commanded by [[Fritz Raweneck]] and [[Kaspar Nostyc]]. Auxiliary forces sent by duke [[Eric II of Pomerania]], an ally of the Polish king, did not enter the battle.\n\n==Polish forces==\nThe Polish forces consisted mostly of the mercenaries hired by the Polish king, [[Casimir IV of Poland|Casimir IV the Jagiellon]] and the city of Danzig ([[Gda\u0144sk]]). This army included 1000 cavalry, of which 112 were heavy cavalry, and another 1000 of infantry. 1000 cavalry and 400 infantry were mercenaries hired by Polish king, while the rest were units from Danzig ([[Gda\u0144sk]]).\n\n==Teutonic forces==\nMost of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic army]], under the command of Fritz Raweneck and Kaspar Nostyc, were troops gathered from the nearby castles Mewe ([[Gniew]]), Stargard ([[Starogard Gda\u0144ski]]), [[Nowe]], [[Skarszewy]] and [[Kiszewy]]. This army totalled 1000 cavalry and 400 infantry. Raweneck also had the supply chain ([[tabor (formation)|tabors]]), cannons and up to 1300 auxiliary infantry of Pomeranian peasants, used mainly for fortification works.\n\n==Battle==\nThe battle started in the evening. Adopting a relatively new tactic, Polish units built a fortified camp on the Hussite model consisting of wagons linked by a chain surrounded by a deep ditch ([[Tabor (formation)|tabor]]). The units of Raveneck and his subordinate, Kaspar Nostyc (commander from Conitz ([[Chojnice]]) also created a tabor. Piotr Dunin decided not to wait for the enemy and attacked first, setting infantry with crossbows on the left, defended by cavalry between the tabor and the coast of the nearby lake of Rogo\u017anica. Raveneck placed cavalry in front of his tabor, and infantry behind it, without any strategic plan. The first phase of the battle was started by a charge of Polish heavy cavalry under [[Pawe\u0142 Jasie\u0144ski]]. Fierce fighting continued for three hours and ended without a clear winner. After a short pause at midday, Teutonic units were able to push the Poles back; however, they found themselves under very heavy fire from crossbows of the Polish infantry, which caused huge losses and a withdrawal. During this fight Raveneck was wounded. He stopped his soldiers and tried to attack again, but this charge ended with a total defeat - Raveneck died and the rest of the cavalry surrendered or escaped. The Teutonic infantry tried to defend themselves at the tabor but its resistance was broken by a quick attack of Polish cavalry.\n\n==Casualties==\nThe Teutonic Order's army lost around 1000 soldiers, including some 300 cavalrymen. Fifty soldiers were captured. The Teutonic commander was also killed in battle and was buried in the \u017barnowiec chapter church.\n\nThe Poles lost just 100 soldiers, although 150 later died from their wounds. Among the dead on the Polish side was [[Maciej Hagen]] from Gda\u0144sk. Piotr Dunin was wounded twice.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe direct result of the battle of \u015awiecino was that the city of Danzig and Pomerania were freed from the danger of an attack by the Teutonic Order. As a result, the royal and municipal armed forces could be used elsewhere in the war, mainly to protect the Vistula waterway and to capture the Teutonic held strongholds. This way that Teutonic forces in Prussia on the right bank of Vistula were cut off from supplies from Western Europe.\n\nThe psychological significance of the battle was that this was the first open field battle won by the royal forces, so it increased the morale of the Polish forces and lowered the morale of the Teutonic Knights. Many military historians say that the battle of \u015awiecino was the turning point of the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]], leading to the final Polish victory in 1466.\n\n==External links==\n* [ \u015awiecino near \u017barnowiec Lake]\n* [http://www.zamek.malbork.com.pl/index.php?m=02&p=11 Malbork Castle - Battle of \u015awiecino]\n\n==References==\n* Janusz Sikorski, ''Zarys historii wojskowo\u015bci powszechnej do ko\u0144ca wieku XIX.

Bubbles, who also sketched and painted privately, is best known for his distinctive contribution to the design practices associated with the British independent music scene of the 1970s and 1980s. His record sleeves, laden with symbols and riddles, were his most recognisable output.\n\n==Early life==\nFulcher was born in Tranmere Road, [[Whitton, London|Whitton]], [[Middlesex]] (now Greater London), in July 1942. He attended [[Isleworth and Syon School|Isleworth Grammar School]]. In 1958 he embarked on a retail display course for a National Diploma in Design (NDD) at the art school of [[Richmond upon Thames College|Twickenham College of Technology]].<ref>[[Reasons to Be Cheerful (book)|Reasons to Be Cheerful]]: The Life & Work Of Barney Bubbles, Paul Gorman (Adelita 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-9552017-3-8}}</ref> During his five years at the college Fulcher received a multi-disciplinary education that included training in cardboard design, display and packaging, skills that would be utilised later in his record sleeve work.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Michael Tucker + Associates===\nAfter leaving college in 1963 Fulcher worked as an assistant at the design company Michael Tucker + Associates in London.<ref name=\"The Life 2010\">[[Reasons to Be Cheerful (book)|Reasons to Be Cheerful]]: The Life & Work Of Barney Bubbles, 2nd edition, Paul Gorman (Adelita 2010) {{ISBN|978-0-9552017-4-5}}</ref> Its clients included [[Pirelli]]. In a rare interview in November 1981 in ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', Bubbles described Tucker's discipline as \"very Swiss; very hard; unjustified, very grey; and he taught me ''everything'' about typography.\" Tucker's studio produced the posters for [[Hugh Hudson]]'s Pirelli-sponsored film ''The Tortoise & The Hare'' (1967), for which Fulcher designed the poster lettering on a freelance basis.<ref name=\"The Life 2010\"/>\n\n===The Conran Group===\nIn May 1965, Fulcher was recruited by The Conran Group as senior graphic designer alongside [[Stafford Cliff]], [[Virginia Clive-Smith]] and [[John Muggeridge]]. He produced a variety of commercial commissions for Conran, including the Norman-style archer logo for [[Strongbow cider]] and items for Conran's new homewares chain [[Habitat (retailer)|Habitat]]. Fulcher also established an association with [[Justin de Blank]], a director at Conran, which blossomed when de Blank left to launch his own upmarket provisions company and restaurant business in 1968.\n\n===A1 Good Guyz and other early activities===\nBetween 1965 and 1966 Fulcher organised happenings, parties and other events under the name ''A1 Good Guyz'' with two graduates of Twickenham Art College, David Wills and Roy Burge.\n\nIn 1967 Fulcher became known as Barney Bubbles, though he did not change his name by [[deed poll]] for several more years. The name came about when Fulcher was operating a light show that created a bubble effect by mixing oils and water on projection slides. These lightshows were for groups including [[The Gun (band)|the Gun]] and [[Quintessence (English band)|Quintessence]] at underground venues including [[the Roundhouse]], [[Jim Haynes]]'s Drury Lane [[Arts Lab]], the [[Electric Cinema, Notting Hill|Electric Cinema]] and [[Middle Earth]].\n\nWith Wills, Bubbles undertook freelance design commissions, including a redesign of ''Motor Racing'' magazine and a recipe book for the English Egg Marketing Board. With a team of contributors Bubbles and Wills art-directed [[Oz (magazine)|''Oz'']] magazine issue 12, dubbed ''The Tax Dodge Special'' and published in May 1968.\n\n===Teenburger Designs===\n[[File:Brinsleyschwarzeponymous.jpg|thumb|right|The original UK LP sleeve of [[Brinsley Schwarz]]'s ''Brinsley Schwarz'' (1970) designed by Barney Bubbles]]\n\nEarly in 1969, Bubbles took the lease on a three-storey building at 307 [[Portobello Road]] in Notting Hill Gate, West London. He converted the ground-floor space into a graphic art studio, which he named Teenburger Designs. With a business association established with two entrepreneurs, Edward Molton and Stephen Warwick, and with [[John Muggeridge]] from Conran serving briefly as an assistant, he set about working primarily for the music industry. His first record sleeve design was for [[Quintessence (English band)|Quintessence]]'s LP ''[[In Blissful Company]]'' (1969). The gatefold sleeve design uses illustrations by Gopala on the front and back, and contains a monochrome glued-in booklet inside.\n\nTeenburger also provided record sleeve designs for the bands [[Brinsley Schwarz]] and [[Red Dirt (band)|Red Dirt]], as well as [[Vertigo Records|Vertigo]] artists such as [[Cressida (progressive rock band)|Cressida]], [[Gracious!]] and Dr Z, whose LP ''Three Parts To My Soul'' is particularly noted for its complex and colourful fold-out sleeve.\n\nFollowing the closure of Teenburger in 1970 as a result of the disappearance of Molton and Warwick, Bubbles worked as the designer of the underground newspaper [[Friends (magazine)|''Friends'']] (later renamed ''Frendz'').<ref>Days in the Life: Voices from the English Underground, 1961\u20131971, Jonathon Green (Pimlico 1998) {{ISBN|978-0-7126-6665-7}}</ref>\n\n===Hawkwind (and other 1970s rock)===\n[[File:In Search of Space - Hawkwind.jpg|thumb|left|The original UK LP sleeve of [[Hawkwind]]'s ''[[In Search of Space]]'' designed by Barney Bubbles]]\n\nWhile he was working at Friends, Bubbles formed an association with [[Hawkwind]] and became responsible for a run of their album sleeves, including ''[[In Search of Space]]'', ''[[Doremi Fasol Latido]]'' and ''[[Space Ritual]]''. Bubbles engaged in many aspects of the group's visual identity, titling releases and designing posters, adverts, stage decoration and performance plans, some of which were adorned with mystical and mock-Teutonic insignia. In 1972 Bubbles produced the triple LP package ''[[Glastonbury Fayre]]''. This comprised a six-panel fold-out card sleeve, two poster inserts, a booklet and a cut-out and build miniature pyramid, housed in a clear vinyl bag (with two sleeve variations and three label variations).\n\nFrom 1973 onwards, Bubbles increasingly avoided credits for his artwork, typically working anonymously or occasionally adopting alternative pseudonyms. During this period he designed album sleeves and additional material for such acts as the [[Sutherland Brothers]], [[Kevin Coyne]], [[Edgar Broughton Band]], [[Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers]], [[Quiver (Rock band)|Quiver]], the [[Kursaal Flyers]] and [[Michael Moorcock|Michael Moorcock and the Deep Fix]].\n\nIn 1976 his design relationship with Hawkwind came to an end. It was rekindled once, in 1978, for the [[Hawklords]] spin-off, but otherwise continued only with design commissions for projects involving the band's saxophonist [[Nik Turner]].\n\n===Stiff, Radar and F Beat (and other punk and new wave)===\n[[File:Carlenecest.jpg|thumb|right|The original UK LP sleeve of [[Carlene Carter]]'s ''[[C'est C Bon]]'' designed by Barney Bubbles]]\nBarney Bubbles joined [[Stiff Records]] as designer and art director early in 1977. With the label's co-founder [[Jake Riviera]] he generated a body of creative work that helped to secure Stiff's reputation as an exciting new independent label. Bubbles created sleeves for bands including [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Ian Dury]] and [[Wreckless Eric]]. Often these were accompanied by quirky logos such as the face logo for [[Ian Dury#The Blockheads|Blockhead]], advertisements and promotional items. The marketing of Elvis Costello's ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' included advertisements in three UK music papers from which a poster of Costello could be constructed, and the first 1,000 pressings contained an insert headed ''Help Us Hype Elvis'', which, if completed and returned to Stiff, ensured that a friend would receive a free copy.\n\nWhen Riviera left Stiff in late 1977, Bubbles joined him at his new label [[Radar Records]] and later at Riviera's [[F-Beat Records]]. At these labels, Bubbles created more designs for Elvis Costello, as well as other artists such as [[Nick Lowe]], [[Carlene Carter]] and [[Clive Langer]] & The Boxes.\n\nBubbles also maintained his freelance output, producing designs for [[Peter Jenner]] (Ian Dury and [[Billy Bragg]]'s manager), and others. He created a prodigious output by working for such bands, musicians and performers as [[Vivian Stanshall]], [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]], [[Big Star]], [[Johnny Moped]], [[Whirlwind]], Billy Bragg, [[Clover (band)|Clover]], [[the Sinceros]], [[Roger Chapman]], [[Phillip Goodhand-Tait]], [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]], [[Inner City Unit]] and [[the Psychedelic Furs]]. As a result, his work appeared on releases by labels such as Aura, [[Chiswick]], [[Utility]], [[Go! Discs]], [[Epic Records|Epic]], [[Charisma]], [[CBS]], [[Line Records]], [[United Artists Records|United Artists]] and [[Riddle Records]]. His signature style emerged as one that was colourful, playful, loaded with geometry, art-history and music-history references, jokes, cryptograms and symbols. The overriding appetite was for going against the grain of accepted design standards.

Basic English is, in essence, a simplified subset of regular English. It was presented in Ogden's book ''Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar'' (1930).\n\nOgden's Basic, and the concept of a simplified English, gained its greatest publicity just after the Allied victory in [[World War II]] as a means for world peace. Although Basic English was not built into a program, similar simplifications have been devised for various international uses. Ogden's associate [[I. A. Richards]] promoted its use in schools in China.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886748,00.html Time Magazine. Dec. 31, 1945. ''Education: Globalingo'']</ref> More recently, it has influenced the creation of [[Voice of America]]'s [[Special English]] for news broadcasting, and [[Simplified Technical English]], another English-based controlled language designed to write technical manuals.\n\nWhat survives today of Ogden's Basic English is the basic 850-word list used as the beginner's vocabulary of the English language taught worldwide, especially in [[Asia]].<ref>Edmond H Weiss ''The Elements of International English Style'', pp. 17-18, M. E. Sharpe, 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-7656-1572-5}}</ref>\n\n== Design principles ==\nOgden tried to simplify English while keeping it normal for native speakers, by specifying grammar restrictions and a [[controlled natural language|controlled small vocabulary]] which makes an extensive use of [[Paraphrase|paraphrasing]]. Most notably, Ogden allowed only 18 verbs, which he called \"operators\".  His ''General Introduction'' says \"There are no 'verbs' in Basic English\", with the underlying assumption that, as noun use in English is very straightforward but verb use/conjugation is not, the elimination of verbs would be a welcome simplification.<ref>A good summary in Bill Templer: ''Towards a People's English: Back to BASIC in EIL'' [http://www.hltmag.co.uk/sep05/mart05.htm#C5 Humanising Language Teaching] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204112933/http://www.hltmag.co.uk/sep05/mart05.htm#C5 |date=December 4, 2008 }}.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|What the World needs most is about 1,000 more dead languages\u2014and one more alive.|C. K. Ogden, The System of Basic English}}\n\n== Word lists ==\nOgden's word lists include only word roots, which in practice are extended with the defined set of affixes and the full set of forms allowed for any available word (noun, pronoun, or the limited set of verbs).<ref>See [http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordthere.html the list of words which are assumed and not counted] for details.</ref> The 850 core words of Basic English are found in Wiktionary's [[wikt:Appendix:Basic English word list|Basic English word list]]. This core is theoretically enough for everyday life. However, Ogden prescribed that any student should learn an additional 150-word list for everyday work in some particular field, by adding a list of 100 words particularly useful in a general field (e.g., science, verse, business, etc.), along with a 50-word list from a more specialised subset of that general field, to make a [[wikt:Appendix:1000 basic English words|basic 1000-word]] vocabulary for everyday work and life.\n\nMoreover, Ogden assumed that any student already should be familiar with (and thus may only review) a core subset of around 200 \"international\" words.<ref>[http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpi.html Ogden's \"International Word\" List\u2014Alphabetic]</ref> Therefore, a first-level student should graduate with a core vocabulary of around 1200 words. A realistic general core vocabulary could contain 2000 words (the core 850 words, plus 200 international words, and 1000 words for the general fields of trade, economics, and science). It is enough for a \"standard\" English level.<ref>[http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpn.html Ogden's Basic English Next Steps]</ref><ref>[http://ogden.basic-english.org/word2000.html Ogden's Basic English Combined Word Lists]</ref> This 2000 word vocabulary represents \"what any learner should know\". At this level students could start to move on their own.\n\nOgden's [[:simple:Wikipedia:Basic English combined wordlist|Basic English 2000 word list]] and Voice of America's [[:simple:Wikipedia:VOA Special English Word Book|Special English 1500 word list]] serve as dictionaries for the [[Simple English Wikipedia]].\n\n== Rules ==\n<!-- Please do not remove or change this Copyvio message until the issue is settled -->\n{{Nobots}}\n{{Copyvio/core\n|url=http://ogden.basic-english.org/rules.html and possibly http://ogden.basic-english.org/basiceng.html\n|month = October\n|day = 9\n|year = 2018\n|time = 23:42\n|timestamp = 20181009234218}}\n<!-- Do not use the \"Copyvio/core\" template directly; the above line is generated by \"subst:Copyvio|url\" -->\nThe [[grammar|word use]] of Basic English is similar to full English, but the rules are much simpler, and there are fewer [[wikt:exception|exceptions]].

Hall, Jr.]].</ref>\n\nAs a teaching aid for [[ESL|English as a Second Language]], Basic English has been criticised for the choice of the core vocabulary and for its grammatical constraints.<ref>For instance, by proponents of Essential World English. See [http://www.langmaker.com/outpost/eswldeng.htm a summary of EWE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818175724/http://www.langmaker.com/outpost/eswldeng.htm |date=August 18, 2006 }} for instance and, again, the linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]].</ref>\n\nIn 1944, [[readability]] expert [[Rudolf Flesch]] published an article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', \"How Basic is Basic English?\" in which he claimed, \"It's not basic, and it's not English.\" The essence of his complaint is that the vocabulary is too restricted, and, as a result, the text ends up being awkward and more difficult than necessary. He also argues that the words in the Basic vocabulary were arbitrarily selected, and notes that there had been no empirical studies showing that it made language simpler.<ref name=\"Flesch\">Flesch, R. F. \"How Basic is Basic English?\" 'Harper's Magazine'', March 1944. pp.&nbsp;339-343.''</ref>\n\n== Literary references ==\nIn the novel ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', published in 1933, [[H. G. Wells]] depicted Basic English as the [[lingua franca]] of a new elite that after a prolonged struggle succeeds in uniting the world and establishing a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government]]. In the future world of Wells' vision, virtually all members of humanity know this language.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944 [[George Orwell]] was a proponent of Basic English, but in 1945 he became critical of [[universal language]]s. Basic English later inspired his use of [[Newspeak]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Illich |first=Ivan |authorlink=Ivan Illich |author2=Barry Sanders |title=ABC: The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind |year=1988 |publisher=[[North Point Press]] |location=[[San Francisco]] |language= |isbn=0-86547-291-2 |pages=109 |quote=The satirical force with which Orwell used Newspeak to serve as his portrait of one of those totalitarian ideas that he saw taking root in the minds of intellectuals everywhere can be understood only if we remember that he speaks with shame about a belief that he formerly held...

Brass instruments are also called ''labrosones'', literally meaning \"lip-vibrated instruments\".<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Baines\n | first = Anthony\n | authorlink =\n | coauthors =\n | title = Brass instruments: their history and development\n | publisher = Dover Publications\n | year = 1993\n | location =\n | page = 300\n | url =\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 0-486-27574-4}}</ref>\n\nThere are several factors involved in producing different [[Pitch of brass instruments|pitches on a brass instrument]]. [[Slide (wind instrument)|Slides]], [[valve]]s, [[Crook (music)|crooks]] (though they are rarely used today), or [[Key (instrument)|keys]] are used to change vibratory length of tubing, thus changing the available [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]], while the player's [[embouchure]], lip tension and air flow serve to select the specific harmonic produced from the available series.\n\nThe view of most scholars (see [[organology]]) is that the term \"brass instrument\" should be defined by the way the sound is made, as above, and not by whether the instrument is actually made of [[brass]]. Thus one finds brass instruments made of wood, like the [[alphorn]], the [[cornett]], the [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]] and the [[didgeridoo]], while some [[woodwind instrument]]s are made of brass, like the [[saxophone]].\n\n== Families ==\nModern brass instruments generally come in one of two families:\n* '''Valved''' brass instruments use a set of valves (typically three or four but as many as seven or more in some cases) operated by the player's fingers that introduce additional tubing, or [[Crook (music)|crooks]], into the instrument, changing its overall length. This family includes all of the modern brass instruments except the [[trombone]]: the [[trumpet]], [[German horn|horn]] (also called [[French horn]]), [[euphonium]], and [[tuba]], as well as the cornet, [[flugelhorn]], [[tenor horn|tenor horn (alto horn)]], [[baritone horn]], [[sousaphone]], and the [[mellophone]]. As valved instruments are predominant among the brasses today, a more thorough discussion of their workings can be found below. The valves are usually [[piston valve]]s, but can be [[rotary valve]]s; the latter are the norm for the horn (except in France) and are also common on the tuba.\n* '''Slide''' brass instruments use a slide to change the length of tubing. The main instruments in this category are the trombone family, though valve trombones are occasionally used, especially in [[jazz]]. The trombone family's ancestor, the [[sackbut]], and the folk instrument [[Bazooka (instrument)|bazooka]] are also in the slide family.\n{{Brass}}\n\nThere are two other families that have, in general, become functionally obsolete for practical purposes. Instruments of both types, however, are sometimes used for [[historically informed performance|period-instrument performances]] of Baroque or Classical pieces. In more modern compositions, they are occasionally used for their intonation or tone color.\n* '''Natural''' brass instruments only play notes in the instrument's [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. These include the [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]] and older variants of the trumpet and horn. The [[natural trumpet|trumpet was a natural brass instrument]] prior to about 1795, and the [[natural horn|horn before about 1820]]. In the 18th century, makers developed interchangeable [[Crook (music)|crooks]] of different lengths, which let players use a single instrument in more than one key. Natural instruments are still played for period performances and some ceremonial functions, and are occasionally found in more modern scores, such as those by [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]].\n* '''Keyed or Fingered''' brass instruments used holes along the body of the instrument, which were covered by fingers or by finger-operated pads (keys) in a similar way to a [[woodwind instrument]]. These included the cornett, serpent, [[ophicleide]], [[keyed bugle]] and [[keyed trumpet]]. They are more difficult to play than valved instruments.\n\n=== Bore taper and diameter ===\nBrass instruments may also be characterised by two generalizations about geometry of the [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]], that is, the tubing between the mouthpiece and the flaring of the tubing into the [[Bell (wind)#Parts|bell]]. Those two generalizations are with regard to\n* the degree of taper or conicity of the bore and\n* the diameter of the bore with respect to its length.\n\n==== Cylindrical vs. conical bore ====\nWhile all modern valved and slide brass instruments consist in part of conical and in part of cylindrical tubing, they are divided as follows:\n* '''Cylindrical bore''' brass instruments are those in which approximately constant diameter tubing predominates. Cylindrical bore brass instruments are generally perceived as having a brighter, more penetrating tone quality compared to conical bore brass instruments. The trumpet, and all trombones are cylindrical bore. In particular, the slide design of the trombone necessitates this.\n* '''Conical bore''' brass instruments are those in which tubing of constantly increasing diameter predominates. Conical bore instruments are generally perceived as having a more mellow tone quality than the cylindrical bore brass instruments. The \"[[Brass band (British style)|British brass band]]\" group of instruments fall into this category. This includes the flugelhorn, [[cornet]], [[alto horn|tenor horn (alto horn)]], baritone horn, horn, euphonium and tuba. Some conical bore brass instruments are more conical than others. For example, the flugelhorn differs from the cornet by having a higher percentage of its tubing length conical than does the cornet, in addition to possessing a wider bore than the cornet. In the 1910s and 1920s, the [[E.A. Couturier]] company built brass band instruments utilizing a patent for a continuous conical bore without cylindrical portions even for the valves or tuning slide.\n\n==== Whole-tube vs. half-tube ====\nThe second division, based on bore diameter in relation to length,<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Bombardon|volume=4|page=182|first=Kathleen |last=Schlesinger|authorlink=Kathleen Schlesinger}}</ref> determines whether the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental tone]] or the first [[overtone]] is the lowest [[Harmonic series (music)#Partial|partial]] practically available to the player:\n\n{{rquote|right|Neither the horns nor the trumpet could produce the 1st note of the harmonic series ... A horn giving the C of an open 8&nbsp;ft organ pipe had to be {{convert|16|ft|0|abbr=on}}. long. Half its length was practically useless ... it was found that if the calibre of tube was sufficiently enlarged in proportion to its length, the instrument could be relied upon to give its fundamental note in all normal circumstances. \u2013 Cecil Forsyth, ''Orchestration'', p. 86<ref name=\"Forsyth_Orchestration\">[https://books.google.com/books/download/ORCHESTRATION.pdf?id=m9_CTe8qNWIC&output=pdf ''Orchestration''], Forsyth, Cecil; MacMillan Books, 1922.</ref>}}\n\n* '''Whole-tube''' instruments have larger bores in relation to tubing length, and can play the fundamental tone with ease and precision. The tuba and euphonium are examples of whole-tube brass instruments.\n* '''Half-tube''' instruments have smaller bores in relation to tubing length and cannot easily or accurately play the fundamental tone. The second partial (first overtone) is the lowest note of each tubing length practical to play on half-tube instruments. The trumpet and horn are examples of half-tube brass instruments.\n\nFor half tube instruments the 'fundamental', although half the frequency of the second harmonic, is in fact a pedal note rather than a true fundamental<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/brassacoustics.html#pedal|title=Brass instrument (lip reed) acoustics: an introduction|author=|date=|website=newt.phys.unsw.edu.au}}</ref>\n\n=== Other brass instruments ===\nThe instruments in this list fall for various reasons outside the scope of much of the discussion above regarding families of brass instruments.\n* [[Alphorn]] (wood)\n* [[Conch (instrument)|Conch]] ([[animal shell|shell]])\n* [[Didgeridoo]] ([[wood]], [[Australia]])\n* [[Natural horn]] (no valves or slides\u2014except tuning crooks in some cases)\n* [[Jazzophone]]\n* [[Keyed bugle]] (keyed brass)\n* [[Keyed trumpet]] (keyed brass)\n* [[Serpent (instrument)|Serpent]] (keyed brass)\n* [[Ophicleide]] (keyed brass)\n* [[Shofar]] ([[horn (anatomy)|animal horn]])\n* [[Vladimirskiy rozhok]] (wood, [[Russia]])\n* [[Vuvuzela]] (simple short horn, origins disputed but achieved fame or notoriety through many [[plastic]] examples in the [[2010 World Cup]])\n* [[Lur]]\n\n=={{anchor|Valves}} Valves==\n<!--Valve (music) redirects here-->\n{{Main|Brass Instrument Valves}}\n[[File:Brass-instrument-keys-2759.jpg|thumb|right|Brass instrument piston valves]]\n[[Image:Dugattyus szelep.png|thumb|right|Piston valve]]\n[[Image:Forgoszelep.png|thumb|right|Rotary valve]]\n[[Image:Brass instrument slides.svg|thumb|right|Slide]]\nValves are used to change the length of tubing of a brass instrument allowing the player to reach the notes of various harmonic series. Each valve pressed diverts the air stream through additional tubing, individually or in conjunction with other valves. This lengthens the vibrating air column thus lowering the fundamental tone and associated harmonic series produced by the instrument. Designs exist, although rare, in which this behaviour is reversed, i.e., pressing a valve removes a length of tubing rather than adding one. One modern example of such an ascending valve is the Yamaha YSL-350C trombone,<ref name=\"YSL-350C\"/> in which the extra valve tubing is normally engaged to pitch the instrument in B{{music|flat}}, and pressing the thumb lever removes a whole step to pitch the instrument in C. Valves require regular [[lubrication]].\n\nA core standard valve layout based on the action of three valves had become almost universal by (at latest) 1864 as witnessed by [[Arban method|Arban's Method]] published in that year. The effect of a particular combination of valves may be seen in the table below. This table is correct for the core 3-valve layout on almost any modern valved brass instrument. The most common four-valve layout is a superset of the well-established 3-valve layout and is noted in the table, despite the exposition of four-valve and also five-valve systems (the latter used on the tuba) being incomplete in this article.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Valve combination and effect on pitch\n!Valve combination !!Effect on pitch !!Interval !!Tuning problems\n|-\n|2 ||{{1/2}} step ||[[Minor second]] ||\n|-\n|1 ||1 step ||[[Major second]] ||\n|-\n|1+2 or 3 ||{{frac|1|1|2}} step ||[[Minor third]] ||Very Slightly sharp\n|-\n|2+3 ||2 steps ||[[Major third]] ||Slightly sharp\n|-\n|1+3 or 4 ||{{frac|2|1|2}} steps ||[[Perfect fourth]] ||Sharp (1+3 only)\n|-\n|1+2+3 or 2+4 ||3 steps ||[[Tritone]] ||Very sharp (1+2+3 only)\n|-\n|1+4 ||{{frac|3|1|2}} steps ||[[Perfect fifth]] ||\n|-\n|1+2+4 or 3+4 ||4 steps ||[[Augmented fifth]] ||Flat\n|-\n|2+3+4 ||{{frac|4|1|2}} steps ||[[Major sixth]] ||Slightly sharp\n|-\n|1+3+4 ||5 steps ||[[Minor seventh]] ||Sharp\n|-\n|1+2+3+4 ||{{frac|5|1|2}} steps ||[[Major seventh]] ||Very sharp\n|}\n\n===Tuning===\nSince valves ''lower'' the pitch, a valve that makes a pitch too low (flat) creates an interval wider than desired, while a valve that plays sharp creates an interval narrower than desired. [[Intonation (music)|Intonation]] deficiencies of brass instruments that are independent of the tuning or temperament system are inherent in the physics of the most popular valve design, which uses a small number of valves in combination to avoid redundant and heavy lengths of tubing<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090727085204/http://music.ou.edu/applied/horn/intonation.html Understanding Brass Instrument Intonation], University of Oklahoma Horn Studio</ref> (this is entirely separate from the slight deficiencies between [[Classical music|Western music's]] dominant [[Equal temperament|equal (even) temperament system]] and the [[Just intonation|just (not equal) temperament]] of the harmonic series itself). Since each lengthening of the tubing has an inversely proportional effect on pitch ([[Pitch of brass instruments]]), while pitch perception is logarithmic, there is no way for a simple, uncompensated addition of length to be correct in every combination when compared with the pitches of the open tubing and the other valves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/brassacoustics.html#valves|title=Brass instrument (lip reed) acoustics: an introduction|website=www.phys.unsw.edu.au|access-date=2017-12-10}}</ref>\n\n====Absolute tube length====\nFor example, given a length of tubing equaling 100 units of length when open, one may obtain the following tuning discrepancies:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Valve combination and creation of pitch discrepancies\n!Valve(s) !!Desired pitch !!Necessary valve length !!Component tubing length !!Difference !!Slide positions\n|-\n|Open tubing ||A{{music|#}}/B{{music|b}} ||0 || \u2013 || \u2013 ||1\n|-\n|2 ||A ||5.9 || \u2013 || \u2013 ||2\n|-\n|1 ||G{{music|#}}/A{{music|b}} ||12.2 || \u2013 || \u2013 ||3\n|-\n|1+2 or 3 ||G ||18.9 ||18.1 ||0.8 ||4\n|-\n|2+3 ||F{{music|#}}/G{{music|b}} ||25.9 ||24.8 ||1.1 ||5\n|-\n|1+3 or 4 ||F ||33.5 ||31.1 ||2.4 ||6 or T\n|-\n|1+2+3 or 2+4 ||E ||41.4 ||37 ||4.4 ||7 or T+2\n|-\n|1+4 ||D{{music|#}}/E{{music|b}} || \u2013 ||45.7 || \u2013 ||T+3\n|-\n|1+2+4 or 3+4 ||D || \u2013 ||52.4 || \u2013 ||T+4\n|-\n|2+3+4 ||C{{music|#}}/D{{music|b}} || \u2013 ||58.3 || \u2013 ||T+5\n|-\n|1+3+4 ||C || \u2013 ||64.6 || \u2013 ||T+6\n|-\n|1+2+3+4 ||B || \u2013 ||70.5 || \u2013 ||T+7\n|}\n\nPlaying notes using valves (notably 1st + 3rd and 1st + 2nd + 3rd) requires [[#Valve tuning compensation|compensation]] to adjust the tuning appropriately, either by the player's lip-and-breath control, via mechanical assistance of some sort, or, in the case of horns, by the position of the stopping hand in the bell.

For the first and third valves this is often designed to be adjusted as the instrument is played, to account for the deficiencies in the valve system.\n[[Image:Trumpet valve bypass.svg|thumb|Trumpet valve bypass (depressed)]]\n\nIn most trumpets and cornets, the compensation must be provided by extending the third valve slide with the third or fourth finger, and the first valve slide with the left hand thumb (see [[#Trigger or throw|Trigger or throw]] below). This is used to lower the pitch of the 1\u20133 and 1\u20132\u20133 valve combinations. On the trumpet and cornet, these valve combinations correspond to low D, low C{{music|sharp}}, low G, and low F{{music|sharp}}, so chromatically, to stay in tune, one must use this method.\n\nIn instruments with a fourth valve, such as tubas, euphoniums, [[piccolo trumpet]]s, etc. that valve lowers the pitch by a perfect fourth; this is used to compensate for the sharpness of the valve combinations 1\u20133 and 1\u20132\u20133 (4 replaces 1\u20133, 2\u20134 replaces 1\u20132\u20133). All three normal valves may be used in addition to the fourth to increase the instrument's range downwards by a perfect fourth, although with increasingly severe [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] problems.\n\nWhen four-valved models without any kind of compensation play in the corresponding register, the sharpness becomes so severe that players must finger the note a half-step below the one they are trying to play. This eliminates the note a half-step above their open fundamental.\n\nManufacturers of low brass instruments may choose one or a combination of four basic approaches to compensate for the tuning difficulties, whose respective merits are subject to debate:\n\n==== Compensation system ====\nIn the Compensation system, each of the first two (or three) valves has an additional set of tubing extending from the back of the valve. When the third (or fourth) valve is depressed in combination with another one, the air is routed through both the usual set of tubing plus the extra one, so that the pitch is lowered by an appropriate amount. This allows compensating instruments to play with accurate intonation in the octave below their open second partial, which is critical for tubas and euphoniums in much of their repertoire.\n\nThe compensating system was applied to horns to serve a different purpose. It was used to allow a double horn in F and B{{music|flat}} to ease playing difficulties in the high register. In contrast to the system in use in tubas and euphoniums, the default 'side' of the horn is the longer F horn, with secondary lengths of tubing coming into play when the first, second or third valves are pressed; pressing the thumb valve takes these secondary valve slides and the extra length of main tubing out of play to produce a shorter B{{music|flat}} horn. A later \"full double\" design has completely separate valve section tubing for the two sides, and is considered superior, although rather heavier in weight.\n\n==== Additional valves ====\nInitially, compensated instruments tended to sound stuffy and blow less freely due to the air being doubled back through the main valves. In early designs, this led to sharp bends in the tubing and other obstructions of the air-flow. Some manufacturers therefore preferred adding more \u2018straight\u2019 valves instead, which for example could be pitched a little lower than the 2nd and 1st valves and were intended to be used instead of these in the respective valve combinations. While no longer featured in euphoniums for decades, many professional tubas are still built like this, with five valves being common on CC- and BB{{music|flat}}-tubas and five or six valves on F-tubas.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nCompensating double horns can also suffer from the stuffiness resulting from the air being passed through the valve section twice, but as this really only affects the longer F side, a compensating double can be very useful for a 1st or 3rd horn player, who uses the F side less.\n\n==== Additional sets of slides on each valve ====\nAnother approach was the addition of two sets of slides for different parts of the range. Some euphoniums and tubas were built like this, but today, this approach has become highly exotic for all instruments except horns, where it is the norm, usually in a double, sometimes even triple configuration.\n\n==== Trigger or throw ====\n<!--[[Throw (music)]], [[Throw (instrument)]], [[Throw (brass instrument)]], [[Throw (musical instrument)]], [[Trigger (music)]], [[Trigger (instrument)]], [[Trigger (brass instrument)]], and [[Trigger (musical instrument)]] redirect directly here.-->\n[[File:Yamaha Flugelhorn YFH-8310Z.jpg|thumb|Flugelhorn with three pistons and a trigger]]\n\nSome valved brass instruments provide '''triggers''' or '''throws''' that manually lengthen (or, less commonly, shorten) the main tuning slide, a valve slide, or the main tubing. These mechanisms alter the pitch of notes that are naturally sharp in a specific register of the instrument, or shift the instrument to another playing range. Triggers and throws permit speedy adjustment while playing.\n\nTrigger is used in two senses:\n* A trigger can be a mechanical lever that lengthens a slide when pressed in a contrary direction. Triggers are sprung in such a way that they return the slide to its original position when released.\n* The term \"trigger\" also describes a device that lengthens certain brass instruments' main length of tubing to shift its range to another playing range, as with [[#Trombone|certain trombones]].\n\nA throw is a simple metal grip for the player's finger or thumb, attached to a valve slide. The general term \"throw\" can describe a u-hook, a saddle (u-shaped grips), or a ring (ring-shape grip) in which a player's finger or thumb rests. A player extends a finger or thumb to lengthen a slide, and retracts the finger to return the slide to its original position.\n\n====Examples of instruments that use triggers or throws====\n\n=====Trumpet or cornet=====\nTriggers or throws are sometimes found on the first valve slide. They are operated by the player's thumb and are used to adjust a large range of notes using the first valve, most notably the player's written top line F, the A above directly above that, and the B{{music|flat}} above that. Other notes that require the first valve slide, but are not as problematic without it include the first line E, the F above that, the A above that, and the third line B{{music|flat}}.\n\nTriggers or throws are often found on the third valve slide. They are operated by the player's fourth finger, and are used to adjust the lower D and C{{music|#}}. Trumpets typically use throws, whilst cornets may have a throw or trigger.\n\n=====Trombone=====\n{{Main|Types of trombone#F attachment}}\n\nTrombone triggers are primarily but not exclusively<ref name=\"YSL-350C\">[http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail.html?CNTID=2265&CTID=242600 Yamaha Catalog YSL-350C] {{Webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090428193549/https://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail.html?CNTID=2265&CTID=242600 |date=2009-04-28 }} with ascending B{{music|flat}}/C rotor</ref> installed on the F-trigger, bass, and contrabass trombones<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/List/ModelSeriesListHE.html?CTID=242800|title=Yamaha Catalog \"Professional Trombones\"|author=|date=|website=yamaha.com}}</ref> to alter the length of tubing, thus making certain ranges and pitches more accessible.\n\n=====Euphoniums=====\nA euphonium occasionally has a trigger on valves other than 2 (especially 3), although many professional quality euphoniums, and indeed other brass band instruments, have a trigger for the main tuning slide.<ref>The [[Besson (company)|Besson]] Prestige [https://web.archive.org/web/20110102123040/http://www.besson.com/en/instruments.php?mode=productDetails&pid=42 euphonium].</ref>\n\n=== Mechanism ===\nThe two major types of valve mechanisms are ''[[rotary valve]]s'' and ''[[piston valve]]s''. The first piston valve instruments were developed just after the start of the 19th century. The ''St\u00f6lzel valve'' (invented by [[Heinrich St\u00f6lzel]] in 1814) was an early variety. In the mid 19th century the ''Vienna valve'' was an improved design. However many professional musicians preferred rotary valves for quicker, more reliable action, until better designs of piston valves were mass manufactured towards the end of the 19th century. Since the early decades of the 20th century, piston valves have been the most common on brass instruments except for the orchestral horn and the tuba.<ref>[http://www.public.asu.edu/~jqerics/about_articles.htm The Early Valved Horn] by John Q. Ericson, Associate Professor of horn at Arizona State University</ref> See also the article [[Brass Instrument Valves]].\n\n==Sound production in brass instruments==\nBecause the player of a brass instrument has direct control of the prime vibrator (the lips), brass instruments exploit the player's ability to select the [[harmonic]] at which the instrument's column of air vibrates. By making the instrument about twice as long as the equivalent woodwind instrument and starting with the second harmonic, players can get a good range of notes simply by varying the tension of their lips (see [[embouchure]]).\n\nMost brass instruments are fitted with a removable [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]. Different shapes, sizes and styles of mouthpiece may be used to suit different embouchures, or to more easily produce certain tonal characteristics. Trumpets, trombones, and tubas are characteristically fitted with a cupped mouthpiece, while horns are fitted with a conical mouthpiece.\n\nOne interesting difference between a [[woodwind instrument]] and a brass instrument is that woodwind instruments are non-directional. This means that the sound produced propagates in all directions with approximately equal volume. Brass instruments, on the other hand, are highly directional, with most of the sound produced traveling straight outward from the bell. This difference makes it significantly more difficult to record a brass instrument accurately. It also plays a major role in some performance situations, such as in marching bands.\n\n==Manufacture==\n===Metal===\nTraditionally the instruments are normally made of [[brass]], [[Metal polishing|polish]]ed and then [[lacquer]]ed to prevent [[corrosion]]. Some higher quality and higher cost instruments use [[gold]] or [[silver]] plating to prevent corrosion.\n\nAlternatives to brass include other alloys containing significant amounts of [[copper]] or silver. These alloys are [[biostatic]] due to the [[oligodynamic effect]], and thus suppress growth of [[mold]]s, [[fungi]] or [[bacteria]]. Brass instruments constructed from [[stainless steel]] or [[aluminium]] have good sound quality but are rapidly colonized by microorganisms and become unpleasant to play.\n\nMost higher quality instruments are designed to prevent or reduce [[galvanic corrosion]] between any steel in the valves and springs, and the brass of the tubing. This may take the form of desiccant design, to keep the valves dry, [[sacrificial zinc]]s, replaceable valve cores and springs, plastic insulating washers, or nonconductive or noble materials for the valve cores and springs. Some instruments use several such features.{{Nonspecific|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe process of making the large open end (bell) of a brass instrument is called ''metal beating''. In making the bell of, for example, a trumpet, a person lays out a pattern and shapes [[sheet metal]] into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped mandrel, and butts the seam, using a notching tool. The seam is brazed, using a [[oxy-fuel welding and cutting|torch]] and smoothed using a hammer or file. A draw bench or arbor press equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a mandrel. A [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]] is used to [[metal spinning|spin]] the bell head and to form a bead at the edge of bell head. Previously shaped bell necks are annealed, using a hand torch to soften the metal for further bending. Scratches are removed from the bell using abrasive-coated cloth.\n\n===Other materials===\n[[File:The Trombone Show (color).JPG|thumb|upright|Quartet with plastic trombones]]\nA few specialty instruments are made from wood. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nInstruments made mostly from plastic emerged in the 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass.<ref name=\"pBone\">{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=Mike|title=pBone plastic trombone|url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/pages/jazz-instrument-reviews/71-brass/12744-pbone-plastic-trombone|website=Jazzwise Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2016|date=20 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|date = 2 May 2013|title = Korg UK takes on distribution of Tromba|accessdate = 12 July 2013|website = Musical Instrument Professional|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130505114137/http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|archive-date = 5 May 2013|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour. The sound plastic instruments produce is different from the one of brass, lacquer, gold or silver. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players.\n\n==Ensembles==\n{{Main|Brass section}}\nBrass instruments are one of the major classical instrument families and are played across a range of [[musical ensemble]]s.\n\n[[Orchestra]]s include a varying number of brass instruments depending on music style and era, typically:\n* two to three trumpets\n* two to four [[French horn]]s\n* two [[tenor trombone]]s\n* one [[bass trombone]]\n* one [[tuba]]\n** [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[classical period (music)|classical period]] orchestras may include valveless trumpets or [[Bugle (instrument)|bugles]], or have valved trumpets/cornets playing these parts, and they may include valveless horns, or have valved horns playing these parts.\n** [[Romantic music|Romantic]], [[20th century classical music|modern]], and [[Contemporary classical music|contemporary]] orchestras may include larger numbers of brass including more exotic instruments.\n\n[[Concert band]]s generally have a larger brass section than an orchestra, typically:\n* four to six trumpets or [[cornet]]s\n* four French horns\n* two to four tenor trombones\n* one to two bass trombones\n* two to three [[euphonium]]s or [[baritone horn]]s\n* two to three tubas\n\n[[Brass band (British style)|British brass bands]] are made up entirely of brass, mostly conical bore instruments.

Yuval investigated Christian reports of these events and stated that they were greatly distorted with claims that if Jews could kill their own children, they could also kill the children of Christians. Yuval rejects the blood libel story as a fantasy of some Christians which could not contain any element of truth in it due to the precarious nature of the Jewish minority's existence in Christian Europe.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/827036.html | title = And if it's not good for the Jews? | author = Lily Galili | publisher = Ha'aretz | date = 18 February 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-18}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Two Nations in Your Womb: Perceptions of Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' by Israel J.

William's hagiographer, [[Thomas of Monmouth]], claimed that every year there is an international council of Jews at which they choose the country in which a child will be killed during Easter, because of a Jewish prophecy that states that the killing of a Christian child each year will ensure that the Jews will be restored to the Holy Land. In 1144, England was chosen, and the leaders of the Jewish community delegated the Jews of Norwich to perform the killing.

Langmuir, Speculum, Vol. 47, No. 3 (July 1972), pp. 459\u2013482.</ref> The case is mentioned by [[Matthew Paris]] and [[Chaucer]], and thus has become well-known. Its notoriety sprang from the intervention of the Crown, the first time an accusation of ritual killing had been given royal credibility.\n\nThe eight-year-old Hugh disappeared at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] on 31 July 1255. His body was probably discovered on 29 August,  in a well. A Jew named Copin or Koppin confessed to involvement. He confessed to [[John Lexington|John of Lexington]], a servant of the crown, and relative of the Bishop of Lincoln. The church stood to gain from the establishment of a martyr's cult. Copin's confession was probably on return for the promise that his life should be spared. He is said to have confessed that the boy had been crucified by the Jews, who had assembled at Lincoln for that purpose. [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], who had reached Lincoln at the beginning of October, had Copin executed and 91 of the Jews of Lincoln seized and sent up to London, where 18 of them were executed. The rest were pardoned at the intercession of the Franciscans or Dominicans.<ref>See Langmuir (1972), p479; Jacobs, ''Jewish Ideals'', pp.&nbsp;192\u2013224</ref> Within a few decades, Jews would be [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled from all of England]] in 1290 and not allowed to return until 1657.\n\n===Continental Europe===\n[[File:Ritualmord-Legende.jpg|thumb|[[Simon of Trent]] blood libel. Illustration in Hartmann Schedel's Weltchronik, 1493]]\n\nMuch like the blood libel of England, the history of blood libel in continental Europe consists of unsubstantiated claims made about the (sometimes) discovered corpses of Christian children. There were frequently associated supernatural events speculated about these discoveries and corpses, events which were often attributed by contemporaries to miracles. Also, just as in England, these accusations in continental Europe typically resulted in the execution of numerous Jews \u2014 sometimes even all, or close to all, the Jews in one town. These accusations and their effects also, in some cases, led to royal interference on behalf of the Jews.\n\nThomas of Monmouth's story of the annual Jewish meeting to decide which local community would kill a Christian child also quickly spread to the continent. An early version appears in ''Bonum Universale de Apibus'' ii. 29, \u00a7 23, by [[Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9]] (a monastery near Cambray). Thomas wrote \"It is quite certain that the Jews of every province annually decide by lot which congregation or city is to send Christian blood to the other congregations.\" Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9 also believed that since the time when the Jews called out to [[Pontius Pilate]], \"His blood be on us, and on our children\" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:25|NIV}}), they have been afflicted with hemorrhages, a condition equated with male menstruation:<ref>Albert Ehrman, \"The Origins of the Ritual Murder Accusation and Blood Libel,\" Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Spring 1976): 86</ref>\n\n<blockquote>A very learned Jew, who in our day has been converted to the (Christian) faith, informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them, toward the close of his life, made the following prediction: 'Be assured that relief from this secret ailment, to which you are exposed, can only be obtained through Christian blood (\"''solo sanguine Christiano''\").' This suggestion was followed by the ever-blind and impious Jews, who instituted the custom of annually shedding Christian blood in every province, in order that they might recover from their malady.</blockquote>\n\nThomas added that the Jews had misunderstood the words of their prophet, who by his expression \"''solo sanguine Christiano''\" had meant not the blood of any Christian, but that of Jesus{{snd}} the only true remedy for all physical and spiritual suffering.  Thomas did not mention the name of the \"very learned\" proselyte, but it may have been [[Nicholas Donin]] of [[La Rochelle]], who in 1240 had a disputation on the [[Talmud]] with [[Yechiel of Paris]], and who in 1242 caused the burning of numerous Talmudic manuscripts in Paris. It is known that Thomas was personally acquainted with this Nicholas. Nicholas Donin and another Jewish convert, Theobald of Cambridge, are greatly credited with the adoption and the belief of the blood libel myth in Europe.<ref>Albert Ehrman, \"The Origins of the Ritual Murder Accusation and Blood Libel,\" Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Spring 1976): 88.</ref>\n\nThe first known case outside England was in [[Blois]], France, in 1171.

His local status as a saint was removed in 1965 by [[Pope Paul VI]].\n\nChristopher of Toledo, also known as Christopher of La Guardia or \"the [[Holy Child of La Guardia]]\", was a four-year-old Christian boy supposedly murdered by two Jews and three [[Converso]]s (converts to Christianity).

Doubleday, 2005. {{ISBN|0-385-50848-4}}</ref> that this case was constructed by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] to facilitate the [[Alhambra decree|expulsion of Jews from Spain]]. He was canonized by [[Pope Pius VII]] in 1805. Christopher has since been removed from the canon.\n\nIn a case at Tyrnau (Nagyszombat, today [[Trnava]], [[Slovakia]]), the absurdity, even the impossibility, of the statements forced by torture from women and children shows that the accused preferred death as a means of escape from the torture, and admitted everything that was asked of them. They even said that Jewish men menstruated, and that the latter therefore practiced the drinking of Christian blood as a remedy.\n\nAt B\u00f6sing (Bazin, today [[Pezinok]], [[Slovakia]]), it was charged that a nine-year-old boy had been bled to death, suffering cruel torture; thirty Jews confessed to the crime and were publicly burned.

The [[Pope|Papacy]] generally opposed them, although it had problems in enforcing its opposition.\n\nIn 1911, the ''[[Dictionnaire apolog\u00e9tique de la foi catholique]]'', an important French Catholic encyclopedia, published an analysis of the blood libel accusations.<ref>English translation [http://counterenlightenment.blogspot.com/2011/04/blood-libel-view-from-1911.html here].</ref> This may be taken as being broadly representative of educated Catholic opinion in continental Europe at that time. The article noted that the popes had generally refrained from endorsing the blood libel, and it concluded that the accusations were unproven in a general sense, but it left open the possibility that some Jews had committed ritual murders of Christians.  Other contemporary Catholic sources (notably the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] periodical ''[[La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica]]'') promoted the blood libel as truth.<ref>As shown by David Kertzer in ''The Popes Against the Jews'' (New York, 2001), pp. 161\u201363.</ref>\n\nToday, the accusations are almost entirely discredited in Catholic circles, and the cults associated with them have fallen into disfavour.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=February 2018}}  For example, [[Simon of Trent]] was deleted from the Calendar of Saints in 1965 and does not appear in the current (2000) edition of the [[Roman Martyrology]].\n\n===Papal pronouncements===\n* [[Pope Innocent IV]] took action against the blood libel: \"5 July 1247 \"Mandate to the prelates of Germany and France to annul all measures adopted against the Jews on account of the ritual murder libel, and to prevent accusation of Arabs on similar charges\" (The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492\u20131404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, pp.&nbsp;188\u2013189, 193\u2013195, 208).  In 1247, he wrote also that \"Certain of the clergy, and princes, nobles and great lords of your cities and dioceses have falsely devised certain godless plans against the Jews, unjustly depriving them by force of their property, and appropriating it themselves;... they falsely charge them with dividing up among themselves on the Passover the heart of a murdered boy...In their malice, they ascribe every murder, wherever it chance to occur, to the Jews. And on the ground of these and other fabrications, they are filled with rage against them, rob them of their possessions without any formal accusation, without confession, and without legal trial and conviction, contrary to the privileges granted to them by the Apostolic See... Since it is our pleasure that they shall not be disturbed,... we ordain that ye behave towards them in a friendly and kind manner. Whenever any unjust attacks upon them come under your notice, redress their injuries, and do not suffer them to be visited in the future by similar tribulations\" (''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1910), Vol. 8, pp.&nbsp;393\u2013394). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08017a.htm]\n* [[Pope Gregory X]] (1271\u20131276) issued a letter which criticized the practice of blood libels and forbade arrests and persecution of Jews based on a blood libel, ''... unless which we do not believe they be caught in the commission of the crime.''<ref name=\"gregx\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g10-jews.html | title=Medieval Sourcebook: Gregory X: Letter on Jews, (1271-76) - Against the Blood Libel | author=[[Pope Gregory X]] | accessdate=2007-05-07 }}</ref>\n* [[Pope Paul III]], in a bull of 12 May 1540, made clear his displeasure at having learned, through the complaints of the Jews of Hungary, Bohemia and Poland, that their enemies, looking for a pretext to lay their hands on the Jews' property, were falsely attributing terrible crimes to them, in particular that of killing children and drinking their blood.\n* [[St. Pius V]] in the bull ''Hebraeorum gens sola'' (26 February 1569), by which he expelled Jews from all the cities of the [[Papal States]] except Rome and Ancona,<ref>Gianfranco Miletto, \"The Human Body as a Musical Instrument in the Sermons of Judah Moscato\", in ''The Jewish Body: Corporeality, Society, and Identity in the Renaissance and Early Modern Period'', edited by Giuseppe Veltri and Maria Diemling (Leiden, 2009), p. 384.</ref> made multiple accusations of wrong-doing against the Jews, including usury, theft, receiving stolen goods, pimping, divination and magic.

Emily found lost and broken things and displayed them in the window, so their owners could come and collect them; the shop did not sell anything. \n\nShe would leave the object in front of her favourite stuffed toy, the large, saggy, pink and white striped cat named Bagpuss, originally intended by Firmin to be a retired Indian Army cat who entertained children in the hospital with his \"visible\" thoughts appearing in a \"thinks bubble\" above his head. When Postgate and Firmin were asked to develop this character for a BBC programme Postgate placed him in the shop with other characters and his \"thinks bubble\" became a way to illustrate the stories and mend or explore the objects that Emily had found. Emily then recited a verse:<ref name=\"Smallfilms\"/>\n\n{{quote|Bagpuss, dear Bagpuss<br />Old Fat Furry Catpuss<br />Wake up and look at this thing that I bring<br />Wake up, be bright, be golden and light<br />Bagpuss, oh hear what I sing}}\n\nWhen Emily had left, Bagpuss woke up. The programme shifted from sepia to colour [[stop motion]] film, and various toys in the shop came to life: Gabriel the toad (who, unlike most Smallfilms characters, could move by a special device beneath his can without the use of stop motion animation) and a [[rag doll]] called Madeleine. The wooden woodpecker bookend became the drily academic Professor [[Yaffle]] (based on the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], whom Postgate had once met),<ref>[[Channel 4]] News, 9 December 2008.</ref> while the mice carved on the side of the \"mouse organ\" (a small mechanical [[pipe organ]] that played rolls of music) woke up and scurried around, singing in high-pitched voices. [[Sandra Kerr]] and [[John Faulkner (musician)|John Faulkner]] provided the voices of Madeleine and Gabriel respectively, and put together and performed all the [[folk song]]s. All the other voices (including the narrator and one out-of-tune mouse) were provided by [[Oliver Postgate|Postgate]], who also wrote the stories.\n\nThe toys discussed what the new object was; someone (usually Madeleine) would tell a story related to the object (shown in an animated thought bubble over Bagpuss's head), often with a song, accompanied by Gabriel on the [[banjo]] (which often sounded a lot more like a guitar), and then the mice, singing in high-pitched squeaky harmony to the tune of ''[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]'' as they worked, mended the broken object. There was much banter between the characters, with the pompous Yaffle constantly finding fault with the playful mice: his complaint, 'Those mice are never serious!' became his main catchphrase. However, peace was always restored by the end of the episode, usually thanks to the timely intervention of Bagpuss, Gabriel or Madeleine. The newly mended thing was then placed in the shop window, so that whoever had lost it would see it as they went past, and could come in and claim it. Then Bagpuss would start yawning again, and as he fell asleep the narrator would speak as the colour faded to sepia and they all became toys again.\n\n{{quote|And so their work was done.<br />  Bagpuss gave a big yawn and settled down to sleep<br />And, of course, when Bagpuss goes to sleep,<br />All his friends go to sleep too.<br />The mice were ornaments on the mouse organ.<br />Gabriel and Madeleine were just dolls.<br />And Professor Yaffle was a carved, wooden [[bookend]] in the shape of a woodpecker.<br />Even Bagpuss himself, once he was asleep, was just an old, saggy cloth cat,<br />Baggy, and a bit loose at the seams,<br />But Emily loved him.}}\n\n==Title sequence==\nThe scene is set at the turn of the 20th century, with Emily Firmin playing the part of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] child Emily.<ref>Postgate, Oliver (2000) ''Seeing Things-A Memoir'' {{ISBN|978-1-84767-840-9}}</ref> The first antique village vignette is a cropped image of [[Horrabridge]] taken in 1898, though nothing is known of the other photo of the children with the pram.<ref>{{cite web| title =Francis Frith Archive|url=http://www.francisfrith.com/horrabridge/| accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref> The shop window was at the Firmin family home in [[Blean]].<ref name=\"BBC\" />\n\n==Episodes==\nThe episodes used to be on at 1:45pm on BBC1 and the titles of the episodes each refer in some way to the object Emily found.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.smallfilms.co.uk/bagpuss/stories.htm\n|title=The Stories|publisher=Smallfilms\n|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Episode&nbsp; !!

Scenes featuring him playing the banjo and singing would have taken quite a bit of time if filmed with the stop-frame method, so Peter Firmin created a mechanism that helped him control Gabriel through a hole in his can.The character was based on a real toad that lived in the basement area of the flat that Peter and Joan Firmin rented in Twickenham beside the River Thames. Peter first made Gabriel (named after Walter Gabriel in [[List of The Archers characters|''The Archers'']], a long-running British radio soap opera) for his live ITV programme \"The Musical Box\". Oliver chose him as one of the characters in Bagpuss and Peter made a new, slightly larger version.\n\nProfessor Yaffle was created as the Bookend who had access to \"facts\".  The BBC did not like Peter's first character, a man in top hat made from black Irish [[bog oak]] called \"Professor Bogwood\". They thought it was too frightening and asked for a non-human instead.\n\nBagpuss is now retired. First he lived with [[Rupert Bear]] in the Rupert Bear Museum in Canterbury, part of the [[Canterbury Heritage Museum]]. After its closure at the end of 2017, he and Rupert Bear moved to the [[Beaney House of Art and Knowledge]] in [[Canterbury]].\n\n[[File:Bagpuss in Canterbury.jpg|thumb|The original Bagpuss doll in the Beaney House of Art and Knowledge in Canterbury, June 2018]]\n\nMost of the stories and songs used in the series are based on folk songs and [[fairy tale]]s from around the world.\n\n==Recognition==\nIn 1987 the [[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] awarded [[honorary degrees]] to Postgate and Firmin.

''Na\u00efve Set Theory''.</ref>\nUnlike [[Set theory#Axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]], which are defined using formal logic, na\u00efve set theory is defined informally, in natural language.

Na\u00efve set theory suffices for many purposes, while also serving as a stepping-stone towards more formal treatments. \n\n==Method==\nA '''na\u00efve theory''' in the sense of \"na\u00efve set theory\" is a non-formalized theory, that is, a theory that uses a [[natural language]] to describe sets and operations on sets. The words '''and''', '''or''', '''if ... then''', '''not''', '''for some''', '''for every''' are treated as in ordinary mathematics. As a matter of convenience, use of na\u00efve set theory and its formalism prevails even in higher mathematics &ndash; including in more formal settings of set theory itself.\n\nThe first development of [[set theory]] was a na\u00efve set theory. It was created at the end of the 19th&nbsp;century by [[Georg Cantor]] as part of his study of [[infinite set]]s<ref>{{harvnb|Cantor|1874}}</ref> and developed by [[Gottlob Frege]] in his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''.\n\nNa\u00efve set theory may refer to several very distinct notions. It may refer to\n* Informal presentation of an axiomatic set theory, e.g. as in ''[[Naive Set Theory (book)|Na\u00efve Set Theory]]'' by [[Paul Halmos]].\n* Early or later versions of [[Georg Cantor]]'s theory and other informal systems.\n* Decidedly inconsistent theories (whether axiomatic or not), such as a theory of [[Gottlob Frege]]<ref>{{harvnb|Frege|1893}} In Volume 2, Jena 1903. pp. 253-261 Frege discusses the antionomy in the afterword.</ref> that yielded [[Russell's paradox]], and theories of [[Giuseppe Peano]]<ref>{{harvnb|Peano|1889}} Axiom 52. chap. IV produces antinomies.</ref> and [[Richard Dedekind]].\n\n===Paradoxes===\nThe assumption that any property may be used to form a set, without restriction, leads to [[paradox]]es.  One common example is [[Russell's paradox]]: there is no set consisting of \"all sets that do not contain themselves\". Thus consistent systems of na\u00efve set theory must include some limitations on the principles which can be used to form sets.\n\n===Cantor's theory===\nSome believe that [[Georg Cantor]]'s set theory was not actually implicated in the set-theoretic paradoxes (see Fr\u00e1polli 1991). One difficulty in determining this with certainty is that Cantor did not provide an axiomatization of his system. By 1899, Cantor was aware of some of the paradoxes following from unrestricted interpretation of his theory, for instance [[Cantor's paradox]]<ref name=Letter_to_Hilbert>Letter from Cantor to [[David Hilbert]] on September 26, 1897, {{harvnb|Meschkowski|Nilson|1991}} p. 388.</ref> and the [[Burali-Forti paradox]],<ref>Letter from Cantor to [[Richard Dedekind]] on August 3, 1899, {{harvnb|Meschkowski|Nilson|1991}} p. 408.</ref> and did not believe that they discredited his theory.<ref name=Letters_to_Dedekind>Letters from Cantor to [[Richard Dedekind]] on August 3, 1899 and on August 30, 1899, {{harvnb|Zermelo|1932}} p. 448 (System aller denkbaren Klassen) and {{harvnb|Meschkowski|Nilson|1991}} p. 407. (There is no set of all sets.)</ref> Cantor's paradox can actually be derived from the above (false) assumption{{what|date=April 2017}} using for {{math|''P''(''x'') \"''x''}} is a [[cardinal number]]\". Frege explicitly axiomatized a theory in which a formalized version of na\u00efve set theory can be interpreted, and it is ''this'' formal theory which [[Bertrand Russell]] actually addressed when he presented his paradox, not necessarily a theory Cantor, who, as mentioned, was aware of several paradoxes, presumably had in mind.\n\n===Axiomatic theories===\nAxiomatic set theory was developed in response to these early attempts to understand sets, with the goal of determining precisely what operations were allowed and when.\n\n===Consistency===\nA na\u00efve set theory is not ''necessarily'' inconsistent, if it correctly specifies the sets allowed to be considered. This can be done by the means of definitions, which are implicit axioms. It is possible to state all the axioms explicitly, as in the case of Halmos' ''Na\u00efve Set Theory'', which is actually an informal presentation of the usual axiomatic [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]]. It is \"na\u00efve\" in that the language and notations are those of ordinary informal mathematics, and in that it doesn't deal with consistency or completeness of the axiom system.\n\nLikewise, an axiomatic set theory is not necessarily consistent: not necessarily free of paradoxes. It follows from [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]] that a sufficiently complicated [[first order logic]] system (which includes most common axiomatic set theories) cannot be proved consistent from within the theory itself &ndash; even if it actually is consistent. However, the common axiomatic systems are generally believed to be consistent; by their axioms they do exclude ''some'' paradoxes, like [[Russell's paradox]]. Based on [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|G\u00f6del's theorem]], it is just not known &ndash; and never can be &ndash; if there are ''no'' paradoxes at all in these theories or in any first-order set theory.\n\nThe term ''na\u00efve set theory'' is still today also used in some literature{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} to refer to the set theories studied by Frege and Cantor, rather than to the informal counterparts of modern axiomatic set theory.\n\n===Utility===\nThe choice between an axiomatic approach and other approaches is largely a matter of convenience. In everyday mathematics the best choice may be informal use of axiomatic set theory.  References to particular axioms typically then occur only when demanded by tradition, e.g. the [[axiom of choice]] is often mentioned when used. Likewise, formal proofs occur only when warranted by exceptional circumstances. This informal usage of axiomatic set theory can have (depending on notation) precisely the ''appearance'' of na\u00efve set theory as outlined below. It is considerably easier to read and write (in the formulation of most statements, proofs, and lines of discussion) and is less error-prone than a strictly formal approach.\n\n== Sets, membership and equality ==\nIn na\u00efve set theory, a '''set''' is described as a well-defined collection of objects. These objects are called the '''elements''' or '''members''' of the set. Objects can be anything: numbers, people, other sets, etc. For instance, 4 is a member of the set of all even [[integer]]s. Clearly, the set of even numbers is infinitely large; there is no requirement that a set be finite.\n\n[[File:Passage with the set definition of Georg Cantor.png|thumb|Passage with the original set definition of Georg Cantor]]\nThe definition of sets goes back to [[Georg Cantor]]. He wrote 1915 in his article ''[http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=pdf&no_cache=1&IDDOC=36218 Beitr\u00e4ge zur Begr\u00fcndung der transfiniten Mengenlehre]'':\n\n<blockquote>\u201cUnter einer 'Menge' verstehen wir jede Zusammenfassung M von bestimmten wohlunterschiedenen Objekten m unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens (welche die 'Elemente' von M genannt werden) zu einem Ganzen.\u201d \u2013 Georg Cantor</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u201cA set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our thought\u2014which are called elements of the set.\u201d \u2013 Georg Cantor</blockquote>\n\n[[File:First usage of the symbol \u2208.png|thumb|right|First usage of the symbol \u03f5 in the work ''[https://archive.org/details/arithmeticespri00peangoog Arithmetices principia nova methodo exposita]'' by [[Giuseppe Peano]].]]\n\n=== Note on consistency ===\nIt does ''not'' follow from this definition ''how'' sets can be formed, and what operations on sets again will produce a set. The term \"well-defined\" in \"well-defined collection of objects\" cannot, by itself, guarantee the consistency and unambiguity of what exactly constitutes and what does not constitute a set. Attempting to achieve this would be the realm of axiomatic set theory or of axiomatic '''class theory'''.\n\nThe problem, in this context, with informally formulated set theories, not derived from (and implying) any particular axiomatic theory, is that there may be several widely differing formalized versions, that have both different sets and different rules for how new sets may be formed, that all conform to the original informal definition. For example, Cantor's verbatim definition allows for considerable freedom in what constitutes a set. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Cantor was particularly interested in sets containing cats and dogs, but rather only in sets containing purely mathematical objects. An example of such a class of sets could be the [[von Neumann universe]]. But even when fixing the class of sets under consideration, it is not always clear which rules for set formation are allowed without introducing paradoxes.\n\nFor the purpose of fixing the discussion below, the term \"well-defined\" should instead be interpreted as an ''intention'', with either implicit or explicit rules (axioms or definitions), to rule out inconsistencies. The purpose is to keep the often deep and difficult issues of consistency away from the, usually simpler, context at hand. An explicit ruling out of ''all'' conceivable inconsistencies (paradoxes) cannot be achieved for an axiomatic set theory anyway, due to G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem, so this does not at all hamper the utility of na\u00efve set theory as compared to axiomatic set theory in the simple contexts considered below. It merely simplifies the discussion. Consistency is henceforth taken for granted unless explicitly mentioned.\n\n=== Membership ===\nIf ''x'' is a member of a set ''A'', then it is also said that ''x'' '''belongs to''' ''A'', or that ''x'' is in ''A''. This is denoted by ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A''. The symbol \u2208 is a derivation from the lowercase Greek letter [[epsilon]], \"\u03b5\", introduced by [[Giuseppe Peano]] in 1889 and shall be the first letter of the word [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%90%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AF \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af] (means \"is\"). The symbol \u2209 is often used to write ''x''&nbsp;\u2209&nbsp;''A'', meaning \"x is not in A\".\n\n=== Equality ===\nTwo sets ''A'' and ''B'' are defined to be '''[[Equality (mathematics)|equal]]''' when they have precisely the same elements, that is, if every element of ''A'' is an element of ''B'' and every element of ''B'' is an element of ''A''. (See [[axiom of extensionality]].) Thus a set is completely determined by its elements; the description is immaterial. For example, the set with elements 2, 3, and 5 is equal to the set of all [[prime number]]s less than 6.\nIf the sets ''A'' and ''B'' are equal, this is denoted symbolically as ''A''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''B'' (as usual).\n\n=== Empty set ===\nThe [[empty set]], often denoted \u00d8 and sometimes <math>\\{\\}</math>, is a set with no members at all. Because a set is determined completely by its elements, there can be only one empty set. (See [[axiom of empty set]].) Although the empty set has no members, it can be a member of other sets. Thus \u00d8 \u2260 {\u00d8}, because the former has no members and the latter has one member. In mathematics, the only sets with which one needs to be concerned can be built up from the empty set alone.({{harvtxt|Halmos|1974}})\n\n== Specifying sets ==\nThe simplest way to describe a set is to list its elements between curly braces (known as defining a set ''extensionally''). Thus {{math|{1, 2}<nowiki/>}} denotes the set whose only elements are {{math|1}} and {{math|2}}.\n(See [[axiom of pairing]].)\nNote the following points:\n*The order of elements is immaterial; for example, {{math|{1, 2} {{=}} {2, 1}<nowiki/>}}.\n*Repetition ([[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]) of elements is irrelevant; for example, {{math|{1, 2, 2} {{=}} {1, 1, 1, 2} {{=}} {1, 2}<nowiki/>}}.\n(These are consequences of the definition of equality in the previous section.)\n\nThis notation can be informally abused by saying something like {{math|{dogs}<nowiki/>}} to indicate the set of all dogs, but this example would usually be read by mathematicians as \"the set containing the single element ''dogs''\".\n\nAn extreme (but correct) example of this notation is {{math|{}<nowiki/>}}, which denotes the empty set.\n\nThe notation {{math|{''x''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''P''(''x'')}<nowiki/>}}, or sometimes {{math|{''x''&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;''P''(''x'')}<nowiki/>}}, is used to denote the set containing all objects for which the condition {{math|''P''}} holds (known as defining a set ''intensionally'').\nFor example, {{math|{''x''&nbsp;: ''x''&nbsp;}} \u2208 '''R'''} denotes the set of [[real number]]s, {{math|{''x''&nbsp;: ''x''&nbsp;has blonde hair}<nowiki/>}} denotes the set of everything with blonde hair.\n\nThis notation is called [[set-builder notation]] (or \"'''set comprehension'''\", particularly in the context of [[Functional programming]]).\nSome variants of set builder notation are:\n*{{math|{''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;: ''P''(''x'')}<nowiki/>}} denotes the set of all {{math|''x''}} that are already members of {{math|''A''}} such that the condition {{math|''P''}} holds for {{math|''x''}}. For example, if {{math|'''Z'''}} is the set of [[integer]]s, then {{math|{''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''Z'''&nbsp;: ''x''&nbsp;is&nbsp;even}<nowiki/>}} is the set of all [[even and odd numbers|even]] integers. (See [[axiom of specification]].)\n*{{math|{''F''(''x'')&nbsp;: ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A''}<nowiki/>}} denotes the set of all objects obtained by putting members of the set {{math|''A''}} into the formula {{math|''F''}}. For example, {{math|{2''x''&nbsp;: ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''Z'''}<nowiki/>}} is again the set of all even integers. (See [[axiom of replacement]].)\n*{{math|{''F''(''x'')&nbsp;: ''P''(''x'')}<nowiki/>}} is the most general form of set builder notation. For example, {{math|{''x'''s&nbsp;owner&nbsp;: ''x''&nbsp;is a dog}<nowiki/>}} is the set of all dog owners.\n\n== Subsets ==\nGiven two sets ''A'' and ''B'', ''A'' is a '''[[subset]]''' of ''B'' if every element of ''A'' is also an element of ''B''.\nIn particular, each set ''B'' is a subset of itself; a subset of ''B'' that is not equal to ''B'' is called a '''proper subset'''.\n\nIf ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', then one can also say that ''B'' is a '''superset''' of ''A'', that ''A'' is '''contained in''' ''B'', or that ''B'' '''contains''' ''A''. In symbols, ''A''&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''B'' means that ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', and ''B''&nbsp;\u2287&nbsp;''A'' means that ''B'' is a superset of ''A''.\nSome authors use the symbols \u2282 and \u2283 for subsets, and others use these symbols only for ''proper'' subsets. For clarity, one can explicitly use the symbols \u228a and \u228b to indicate non-equality.\n\nAs an illustration, let '''R''' be the set of real numbers, let '''Z''' be the set of integers, let ''O'' be the set of odd integers, and let ''P'' be the set of current or former [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]].\nThen ''O'' is a subset of '''Z''', '''Z''' is a subset of '''R''', and (hence) ''O'' is a subset of '''R''', where in all cases ''subset'' may even be read as ''proper subset''.\nNote that not all sets are comparable in this way. For example, it is not the case either that '''R''' is a subset of ''P'' nor that ''P'' is a subset of '''R'''.\n\nIt follows immediately from the definition of equality of sets above that, given two sets ''A'' and ''B'', ''A''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''B'' if and only if ''A''&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''B'' and ''B''&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''A''. In fact this is often given as the definition of equality. Usually when trying to [[mathematical proof|prove]] that two sets are equal, one aims to show these two inclusions. Note that the [[empty set]] is a subset of every set (the statement that all elements of the empty set are also members of any set ''A'' is [[vacuously true]]).\n\nThe set of all subsets of a given set ''A'' is called the '''[[power set]]''' of ''A'' and is denoted by <math>2^A</math> or <math>P(A)</math>; the \"''P''\" is sometimes in a [[Script (typefaces)|script]] font. If the set ''A'' has ''n'' elements, then <math>P(A)</math> will have <math>2^n</math> elements.\n\n== Universal sets and absolute complements ==\nIn certain contexts, one may consider all sets under consideration as being subsets of some given [[universe (mathematics)|universal set]].\nFor instance, when investigating properties of the [[real number]]s '''R''' (and subsets of '''R'''), '''R''' may be taken as the universal set. A true universal set is not included in standard set theory (see '''[[#Paradoxes|Paradoxes]]''' below), but is included in some non-standard set theories.\n\nGiven a universal set '''U''' and a subset ''A'' of '''U''', the '''[[complement (set theory)|complement]]''' of ''A'' (in '''U''') is defined as\n:''A''<sup>C</sup>&nbsp;:= {''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''U'''&nbsp;: ''x''&nbsp;\u2209&nbsp;''A''}.\nIn other words, ''A''<sup>C</sup> (\"''A-complement''\"; sometimes simply ''A''', \"''A-prime''\" ) is the set of all members of '''U''' which are not members of ''A''.\nThus with '''R''', '''Z''' and ''O'' defined as in the section on subsets, if '''Z''' is the universal set, then ''O<sup>C</sup>'' is the set of even integers, while if '''R''' is the universal set, then ''O<sup>C</sup>'' is the set of all real numbers that are either even integers or not integers at all.\n\n== Unions, intersections, and relative complements ==\nGiven two sets ''A'' and ''B'', their '''[[union (set theory)|union]]''' is the set consisting of all objects which are elements of ''A'' or of ''B'' or of both (see [[axiom of union]]). It is denoted by ''A''&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;''B''.\n\nThe '''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]''' of ''A'' and ''B'' is the set of all objects which are both in ''A'' and in ''B''. It is denoted by ''A''&nbsp;\u2229&nbsp;''B''.\n\nFinally, the '''[[complement (set theory)|relative complement]]''' of ''B'' relative to ''A'', also known as the '''set theoretic difference''' of ''A'' and ''B'', is the set of all objects that belong to ''A'' but ''not'' to ''B''. It is written as ''A''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''B'' or ''A''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''B''.\n\nSymbolically, these are respectively\n:''A''&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;B&nbsp;:= {''x''&nbsp;: (''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A'')&nbsp;[[logical disjunction|or]] (''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''B'')};\n:''A''&nbsp;\u2229&nbsp;''B''&nbsp;:= {''x''&nbsp;: (''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A'')&nbsp;[[logical conjunction|and]] (''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''B'')}&nbsp;= {''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;: ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''B''}&nbsp;= {''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''B''&nbsp;: ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A''};\n:''A''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''B''&nbsp;:= {''x''&nbsp;: (''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A'')&nbsp;and&nbsp;[[negation|not]] (''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''B'') }&nbsp;= {''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;: not (''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''B'')}.\n\nNotice that ''A'' doesn't have to be a subset of ''B'' for ''B''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''A'' to make sense; this is the difference between the relative complement and the absolute complement (''A''<sup>C</sup> = ''U''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''A'') from the previous section.\n\nTo illustrate these ideas, let ''A'' be the set of left-handed people, and let ''B'' be the set of people with blond hair. Then ''A''&nbsp;\u2229&nbsp;''B'' is the set of all left-handed blond-haired people, while ''A''&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;''B'' is the set of all people who are left-handed or blond-haired or both. ''A''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''B'', on the other hand, is the set of all people that are left-handed but not blond-haired, while ''B''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''A'' is the set of all people who have blond hair but aren't left-handed.\n\nNow let ''E'' be the set of all human beings, and let ''F'' be the set of all living things over 1000 years old. What is ''E''&nbsp;\u2229&nbsp;''F'' in this case? No living human being is [[Oldest people|over 1000 years old]], so ''E''&nbsp;\u2229&nbsp;''F'' must be the [[empty set]] {}.\n\nFor any set ''A'', the power set <math>P(A)</math> is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] under the operations of union and intersection.\n\n== Ordered pairs and Cartesian products ==\nIntuitively, an '''[[ordered pair]]''' is simply a collection of two objects such that one can be distinguished as the ''first element'' and the other as the ''second element'', and having the fundamental property that, two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their ''first elements'' are equal and their ''second elements'' are equal.\n\nFormally, an ordered pair with '''first coordinate''' ''a'', and '''second coordinate''' ''b'', usually denoted by (''a'', ''b''), can be defined as the set <nowiki>{{</nowiki>''a''<nowiki>}</nowiki>,&nbsp;<nowiki>{</nowiki>''a'', ''b''<nowiki>}}</nowiki>.\n\nIt follows that, two ordered pairs (''a'',''b'') and (''c'',''d'') are equal if and only if ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c'' and ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''d''.\n\nAlternatively, an ordered pair can be formally thought of as a set {a,b} with a [[total order]].\n\n(The notation (''a'', ''b'') is also used to denote an [[open interval]] on the [[real number line]], but the context should make it clear which meaning is intended. Otherwise, the notation ]''a'', ''b''[ may be used to denote the open interval whereas (''a'', ''b'') is used for the ordered pair).\n\nIf ''A'' and ''B'' are sets, then the '''[[Cartesian product]]''' (or simply '''product''') is defined to be:\n:''A''&nbsp;\u00d7 ''B''&nbsp;= {(''a'',''b'')&nbsp;: ''a'' is in ''A'' and ''b'' is in ''B''}.\nThat is, ''A''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''B'' is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate is an element of ''A'' and whose second coordinate is an element of ''B''.\n\nThis definition may be extended to a set ''A''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''B''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''C'' of ordered triples, and more generally to sets of ordered [[n-tuple]]s for any positive integer ''n''.\nIt is even possible to define infinite [[Cartesian product]]s, but this requires a more recondite definition of the product.\n\nCartesian products were first developed by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] in the context of [[analytic geometry]]. If '''R''' denotes the set of all [[real number]]s, then '''R'''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;:=&nbsp;'''R'''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;'''R''' represents the [[Euclidean plane]] and '''R'''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;:=&nbsp;'''R'''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;'''R'''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;'''R''' represents three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].\n\n== Some important sets ==\nThere are some ubiquitous sets that for which the notation is almost universal. Some of these are listed below. In the list, ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' refer [[natural number]]s, and ''r'' and ''s'' are [[real number]]s.\n# [[Natural number]]s are used for counting. A [[blackboard bold]] capital '''N''' (<math>\\mathbb{N}</math>) often represents this set.\n# [[Integer]]s appear as solutions for ''x'' in equations like ''x'' + ''a'' = ''b''. A blackboard bold capital '''Z''' (<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>) often represents this set (from the German ''Zahlen'', meaning ''numbers'').\n# [[Rational number]]s appear as solutions to equations like ''a'' + ''bx'' = ''c''. A blackboard bold capital '''Q''' (<math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>) often represents this set (for ''[[quotient]]'', because R is used for the set of real numbers).\n# [[Algebraic number]]s appear as solutions to [[polynomial]] equations (with integer coefficients) and may involve [[Nth root|radicals]] (including <math>i=\\sqrt{-1\\,}</math>) and certain other [[irrational number]]s. A '''Q''' with an overline (<math>\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}</math>) often represents this set. The overline denotes the operation of [[algebraic closure]].\n# [[Real number]]s represent the \"real line\" and include all numbers that can be approximated by rationals. These numbers may be rational or algebraic but may also be [[transcendental number]]s, which cannot appear as solutions to polynomial equations with rational coefficients. A blackboard bold capital '''R''' (<math>\\mathbb{R}</math>) often represents this set.\n# [[Complex number]]s are sums of a real and an imaginary number: <math>r+s\\,i</math>. Here either <math>r</math> or <math>s</math> (or both) can be zero; thus, the set of real numbers and the set of strictly imaginary numbers are subsets of the set of complex numbers, which form an [[algebraic closure]] for the set of real numbers, meaning that every polynomial with coefficients in <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> has at least one [[Root of a function|root]] in this set. A blackboard bold capital '''C''' (<math>\\mathbb{C}</math>) often represents this set. Note that since a number <math>r+s\\,i</math> can be identified with a point <math>(r,s)</math> in the plane, <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> is basically \"the same\" as the [[Cartesian product]] <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>\u00d7<math>\\mathbb{R}</math> (\"the same\" meaning that any point in one determines a unique point in the other and for the result of calculations, it doesn't matter which one is used for the calculation, as long as multiplication rule is appropriate for <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>).\n\n== Paradoxes in early set theory ==\n{{main|Paradox}}\nThe unrestricted formation principle of sets referred to as the [[Axiom schema of specification#Unrestricted comprehension|axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension]],\n:''If'' {{math|''P''}} ''is a property, then there exists a set'' {{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : ''P''(''x'')}<nowiki/>}} ('''false'''),<ref name=Jech>{{harvnb|Jech|2002}} p. 4.</ref>\nis the source of several early appearing paradoxes:\n*{{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : ''x'' is an ordinal}<nowiki/>}} leads 1897 to the [[Burali-Forti paradox]], the first published [[antinomy]].\n*{{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : ''x'' is a cardinal}<nowiki/>}} produced [[Cantor's paradox]] in 1897.<ref name=Letter_to_Hilbert/>\n*{{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : {} {{=}} {}<nowiki/>}<nowiki/>}} yielded '''Cantor's second antinomy''' in the year 1899.<ref name=Letters_to_Dedekind/> Here the property {{math|''P''}} is true for all {{math|''x''}}, whatever {{math|''x''}} may be, so {{math|''Y''}} would be a [[universal set]], containing everything.\n*{{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : ''x'' \u2209 ''x''}<nowiki/>}}, i.e. the set of all sets that do not contain themselves as elements gave [[Russell's paradox]] 1902.\n\nIf the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension is weakened to the [[axiom schema of specification]] or '''axiom schema of separation''',\n:''If'' {{math|''P''}} ''is a property, then for any set'' {{math|''X''}} ''there exists a set'' {{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' \u2208 ''X'' : ''P''(''x'')}<nowiki/>}},<ref name=Jech/>\nthen all the above paradoxes disappear.<ref name=Jech/> There is a corollary. With the axiom schema of separation as an axiom of the theory, it follows, as a theorem of the theory:\n:''The set of all sets does not exist''.\nOr, more spectacularly (Halmos' phrasing<ref>{{citation|last=Halmos|year=1974|title=Na\u00efve Set Theory|chapter=2}}</ref>): There is no [[Domain of discourse|universe]]. ''Proof'': Suppose that it exists and call it {{math|''U''}}. Now apply the axiom schema of separation with {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''U''}} and for {{math|''P''(''x'')}} use {{math|''x'' \u2209 ''x''}}. This leads to Russell's paradox again. Hence {{math|''U''}} can't exist in this theory.<ref name=Jech/>\n\nRelated to the above constructions is formation of the set\n*{{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : (''x'' \u2208 ''x'') \u2192 {} \u2260 {}<nowiki/>}<nowiki/>}}, where the statement following the implication certainly is false. It follows, from the definition of {{math|''Y''}}, using the usual inference rules (and some afterthought when reading the proof in the linked article below) both that {{math|''Y'' \u2208 ''Y'' \u2192 {} \u2260 {}<nowiki/>}} and {{math|''Y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} holds, hence {{math|{} \u2260 {}<nowiki/>}}. This is [[Curry's paradox#Naive set theory|Curry's paradox]].\n\nIt is (perhaps surprisingly) not the possibility of {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''x''}} that is problematic. It is again the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension allowing {{math|(''x'' \u2208 ''x'') \u2192 {} \u2260 {}<nowiki/>}} for {{math|''P''(''x'')}}. With the axiom schema of specification instead of unrestricted comprehension, the conclusion {{math|''Y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} doesn't hold and, hence {{math|{} \u2260 {}<nowiki/>}} is not a logical consequence.\n\nNonetheless, the possibility of {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''x''}} is often removed explicitly<ref>{{citation|last=Halmos|year=1974|title=Na\u00efve Set Theory}} See discussion around Russell's paradox.</ref> or, e.g. in ZFC, implicitly,<ref name=\"Jech 2002\">{{harvnb|Jech|2002}} Section 1.6.</ref> by demanding the [[axiom of regularity]] to hold.<ref name=\"Jech 2002\"/> One consequence of it is\n:''There is no set'' {{math|''X''}} ''for which'' {{math|''X'' \u2208 ''X''}},\nor, in other words, no set is an element of itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Jech|2002}} p. 61.</ref>\n\nThe axiom schema of separation is simply too weak (while unrestricted comprehension is a very strong axiom&mdash;too strong for set theory) to develop set theory with its usual operations and constructions outlined above.<ref name=Jech/> The axiom of regularity is of a restrictive nature as well. Therefore, one is led to the formulation of other axioms to guarantee the existence of enough sets to form a set theory. Some of these have been described informally above and many others are possible. Not all conceivable axioms can be combined freely into consistent theories. For example, the [[axiom of choice]] of ZFC is incompatible with the conceivable '''every set of reals is [[Lebesgue measurable]]'''. The former implies the latter is false.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Algebra of sets]]\n* [[Axiomatic set theory]]\n* [[Internal set theory]]\n* [[Set theory]]\n* [[Set (mathematics)]]\n* [[Partially ordered set]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2011}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki, N.]], ''Elements of the History of Mathematics'', John Meldrum (trans.), Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, 1994.\n*{{citation|first=Georg|last=Cantor|author-link=Georg Cantor|title=Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen|journal=[[Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik|J.

A simple murmured phonation, {{IPA|[\u0266]}} (not actually a [[fricative consonant]], as a literal reading of the IPA chart would suggest), can sometimes be heard as an [[allophone]] of English {{IPA|/h/}} between vowels, such as in the word ''behind'', for some speakers.\n\nIn the context of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]] like [[Sanskrit]] and [[Hindi]] and comparative [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European studies]], murmured consonants are often called ''voiced aspirated'', as in the Hindi and Sanskrit stops normally denoted ''bh, dh, \u1e0dh, jh,'' and ''gh'' and the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] phoneme ''g\u02b7\u02b0''. From an articulatory perspective, that terminology is incorrect, as murmur is a different type of phonation from [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]]. However, murmured and aspirated stops are acoustically similar in that in both cases there is a delay in the onset of full voicing. In the history of several languages, like [[Greek language|Greek]] and some [[varieties of Chinese]], murmured stops have developed into aspirated stops.\n\nThere is some confusion as to the nature of murmured phonation. The IPA and authors such as [[Peter Ladefoged]] equate phonemically contrastive murmur with ''breathy voice'' in which the vocal folds are held with lower tension (and further apart) than in modal voice, with a concomitant increase in airflow and slower vibration of the glottis. In that model, murmur is a point in a continuum of glottal aperture between modal voice and breath phonation (voicelessness).\n\nOthers, such as Laver, Catford, Trask and the authors of the [[Voice Quality Symbols]] (VoQS), equate murmur with ''whispery voice'' in which the vocal folds or, at least, the anterior part of the vocal folds vibrates, as in modal voice, but the arytenoid cartilages are held apart to allow a large turbulent airflow between them. In that model, murmur is a compound phonation of approximately modal voice plus whisper.\n\nIt is possible that the realization of murmur varies among individuals or languages. The IPA uses the term \"breathy voice\", but VoQS uses the term \"whispery voice\". Both accept the term \"murmur\", popularised by Ladefoged.<ref>Trask (1996) \"breathy voice\", \"murmur\", \"whispery voice\", in ''A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology''.</ref>\n\n==Transcription==\nA stop with murmured release or a murmured nasal is transcribed in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] as {{IPA|[b\u02b1], [d\u02b1], [\u0261\u02b1], [m\u02b1]}} etc. or as {{IPA|[b\u0324], [d\u0324], [\u0261\u0308], [m\u0324]}} etc. Murmured vowels are most often written {{IPA|[a\u0324], [e\u0324],}} etc.\n\nIn VoQS, the notation {{IPA|{V\u0324}}} is used for whispery voice (or murmur), and {{IPA|{V\u02b0}}} is used for breathy voice. Some authors, such as Laver, suggest the alternative transcription {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u1e05\u1ea1\u027e}}}} (rather than IPA {{angle bracket|{{IPA|b\u0324a\u0324\u027e}}}}) as the correct analysis of [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] {{IPA|/b\u0266a\u027e/}}, but it could be confused with the replacement of modal voicing in voiced segments with [[whispering|whispered]] phonation, conventionally transcribed with the diacritic {{IPA|\u25cc\u0323}}.<ref>Laver (1994) ''Principles of Phonetics'', p. 354</ref>\n\n==Methods of production==\nThere are several ways to produce murmured sounds such as {{IPAblink|\u0266}}. One is to hold the vocal folds apart, so that they are lax as they are for {{IPA|[h]}}, but to increase the volume of airflow so that they vibrate loosely. A second is to bring the vocal folds closer together along their entire length than in voiceless {{IPA|[h]}}, but not as close as in modally voiced sounds such as vowels. This results in an airflow intermediate between {{IPA|[h]}} and vowels, and is the case with English intervocalic /h/. A third is to constrict the glottis, but separate the [[arytenoid cartilage]]s that control one end. This results in the vocal folds being drawn together for voicing in the back, but separated to allow the passage of large volumes of air in the front. This is the situation with Hindi.\n\nThe distinction between the latter two of these realizations, vocal folds somewhat separated along their length (''breathy voice'') and vocal folds together with the arytenoids making an opening (''whispery voice''), is phonetically relevant in [[Hmong language|White Hmong]] (''Hmong Daw'').<ref>Fulop & Golston (2008), ''Breathy and whispery voicing in White Hmong'', http://zimmer.csufresno.edu/~chrisg/index_files/FulopGolston2009.pdf. Retrieved 17 June 2012.</ref>\n\n==Phonological property==\nA number of languages use breathy voicing in a phonologically contrastive way. Many [[Indo-Aryan languages]], such as [[Hindi]], typically have a four-way contrast among plosives and affricates (voiced, murmured, [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], aspirated) and a two-way contrast among nasals (voiced, murmured). The [[Nguni languages]] within the southern branch of the [[Bantu languages]], including [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Southern Ndebele language|Southern Ndebele]] and [[Swazi language|Swazi]], also have contrastive murmur. In the case of Xhosa, there is a four-way contrast analogous to Indic in oral [[click consonant|clicks]], and similarly a two-way contrast among nasal clicks, but a three-way contrast among plosives and affricates (murmured, aspirated, and [[ejective consonant|ejective]]), and two-way contrasts among fricatives (voiceless and murmured) and nasals (voiced and murmured).\n\nIn some Bantu languages, historically murmured stops have been phonetically devoiced,<ref>Traill, Anthony, James S. M. Khumalo and Paul Fridjhon (1987). Depressing facts about Zulu. African Studies 46: 255-274.</ref> but the four-way contrast in the system has been retained. In all five of the southeastern Bantu languages named, the murmured stops (even if they are realised phonetically as devoiced aspirates) have a marked tone-lowering (or tone-depressing) effect on the following [[tautosyllabic]] vowels. For this reason, such stop consonants are frequently referred to in the local linguistic literature as 'depressor' stops.\n\nSwazi, and to a greater extent Phuthi, display good evidence that breathy voicing can be used as a morphological property independent of any consonant voicing value.

Then, there exist integers ''x'' and ''y'' such that {{nowrap|''ax'' + ''by'' &#61; ''d''}}. More generally, the integers of the form {{nowrap|''ax'' + ''by''}} are exactly the multiples of ''d''.}}\n\nThe integers ''x'' and ''y'' are called '''B\u00e9zout coefficients''' for (''a'', ''b''); they are not unique. A pair of B\u00e9zout coefficients can be computed by the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]]. If both ''a'' and ''b'' are nonzero, the extended Euclidean algorithm produces one of the two pairs such that <math>|x|\\le \\left |\\frac{b}{d}\\right |</math> and <math>|y|\\le\\left |\\frac{a}{d}\\right |</math>\n(equality may occur only if one of ''a'' and ''b'' is a multiple of the other).\n\nMany other theorems in elementary number theory, such as  [[Euclid's lemma]] or [[Chinese remainder theorem]], result from B\u00e9zout's identity.\n\nA [[B\u00e9zout domain]] is an [[integral domain]] in which B\u00e9zout's identity holds. In particular, B\u00e9zout's identity holds in [[principal ideal domain]]s. Every theorem that results from B\u00e9zout's identity is thus true in all these domains.\n\n==Structure of solutions==\n\nWhen one pair of B\u00e9zout coefficients {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} has been computed (e.g., using [[extended Euclidean algorithm]]), all pairs can be represented in the form\n\n:<math>\\left(x+k\\frac{b}{\\gcd(a,b)},\\ y-k\\frac{a}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\right),</math>\nwhere {{math|''k''}} is an arbitrary integer and the fractions simplify to integers.\n\nAmong these pairs of B\u00e9zout coefficients, exactly two of them satisfy \n:<math> |x| \\le \\left |\\frac{b}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\right |\\quad \\text{and}\\quad |y| \\le \\left |\\frac{a}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\right |,</math>\nand equality may occur only if one of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} divides the other.\n\nThis relies on a property of [[Euclidean division]]: given two integers ''c'' and ''d'', if ''d'' does not divide ''c'', there is exactly one pair {{math|(''q'',''r'')}} such that {{math|1=''c'' = ''dq'' + ''r''}} and {{math|1=0 < ''r'' < {{!}}''d''{{!}}}}, and another one such that {{math|1=''c'' = ''dq'' + ''r''}} and {{math|1=-{{!}}''d''{{!}} < ''r'' < 0}}.\n\nThe two pairs of small B\u00e9zout's coefficients are obtained from the given one {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} by choosing for {{math|''k''}} in the above formula either of the two integers next to <math>\\frac{-x}{b/\\gcd(a,b)}</math>.\n\nThe Extended Euclidean algorithm always produces one of these two minimal pairs.\n\n===Example===\n\nLet ''a'' = 12 and ''b'' = 42, gcd (12, 42) = 6. Then we have the following B\u00e9zout's identities, with the B\u00e9zout coefficients written in red for the minimal pairs and in blue for the other ones.\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\vdots \\\\\n12 &\\times \\color{blue}{-10} & + \\;\\; 42  &\\times \\color{blue}{3} &= 6 \\\\\n12 &\\times \\color{red}{-3} & + \\;\\;42  &\\times \\color{red}{1} &= 6 \\\\\n12 &\\times \\color{red}{4}  & + \\;\\;42  &\\times\\color{red}{-1} &= 6 \\\\\n12 &\\times \\color{blue}{11} & + \\;\\;42  &\\times \\color{blue}{-3} &= 6 \\\\\n12 &\\times \\color{blue}{18} & + \\;\\;42  &\\times \\color{blue}{-5} &= 6 \\\\\n\\vdots\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIf {{math|1=(x, y) = (18, -5)}} is the original pair of B\u00e9zout coefficients, then <math>\\frac{-18}{42/6} \\in [-3, -2]</math> yields the minimal pairs via {{math|1=''k'' = -3}} resp. {{math|1=''k'' = -2}}: {{math|1=(18-3\u22c57, -5+3\u22c52) = (-3, 1)}} and {{math|1=(18-2\u22c57, -5+2\u22c52) = (4, -1)}}.\n\n==Proof==\nGiven any nonzero integers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, let <math>S=\\{ax+by \\mid x,y\\in\\mathbb{Z} </math> and <math> ax+by>0\\}.</math> The set {{mvar|S}} is nonempty since it contains either {{mvar|a}} or {{math|\u2013''a''}} (with {{math|1=''x'' = \u00b11}} and {{math|1=''y'' = 0}}). Since {{mvar|S}} is a nonempty set of positive integers, it has a minimum element <math>d = as + bt</math>, by the [[Well-ordering principle]]. To prove that {{mvar|d}} is the greatest common divisor of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, we must prove that {{mvar|d}} is a common divisor of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, and that for any other common divisor {{mvar|c}}, one has {{math|''c'' < ''d''}}.\n\nThe [[Euclidean division]] of {{mvar|a}} by {{mvar|d}} may be written\n:<math>a=dq+r\\quad\\text{with}\\quad 0\\le r<d.</math>\nThe remainder {{mvar|r}} is in <math>S\\cup \\{0\\}</math>, because\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nr  & = a - qd \\\\\n& = a - q(as+bt)\\\\\n& = a(1-qs) - bqt.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nAs {{mvar|d}} is the smallest positive integer in {{mvar|S}}, the remainder {{mvar|r}} is necessarily 0, and this implies that {{mvar|d}} is a divisor of {{mvar|a}}. Similarly {{mvar|d}} is also a divisor of {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|d}} is a common divisor of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}.\n\nNow, let {{mvar|c}} be any common divisor of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}; that is there exist {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} such that\n{{math|1=''a'' = ''cu''}} and {{math|1=''b'' = ''cv''}}. One has thus\n:<math>\\begin{align}d&=as + bt\\\\\n& =cus+cvt\\\\\n&=c(us+vt).\\end{align} </math>\nThat is {{mvar|c}} is a divisor of {{mvar|d}}, and, therefore {{math|''c'' \u2264 ''d''}}\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===For three or more integers===\n\nB\u00e9zout's identity can be extended to more than two integers: if \n:<math>\\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) = d</math>\n\nthen there are integers <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n</math> such that\n\n:<math>d = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \\cdots + a_n x_n</math>\n\nhas the following properties:\n* ''d'' is the smallest positive integer of this form\n* every number of this form is a multiple of ''d''\n\n===For polynomials===\n{{main|Polynomial greatest common divisor#B\u00e9zout's identity and extended GCD algorithm}}\nB\u00e9zout's identity works for [[univariate polynomial]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] exactly in the same ways as for integers. In particular the B\u00e9zout's coefficients and the greatest common divisor may be computed with the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].\n\nAs the common [[root of a polynomial|root]]s of two polynomials are the roots of their greatest common divisor, B\u00e9zout's identity and [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] imply the following result: \n:For univariate polynomials ''f'' and ''g'' with coefficients in a field, there exist polynomials ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''af'' + ''bg'' = 1 if and only if ''f'' and ''g'' have no common root in any [[algebraically closed field]] (commonly the field of [[complex number]]s).\n\nThe generalization of this result to any number of polynomials and indeterminates is [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]].\n\n===For principal ideal domains===\nAs noted in the introduction, B\u00e9zout's identity works not only in the [[ring (algebra)|ring]] of integers, but also in any other [[principal ideal domain]] (PID).\nThat is, if ''R'' is a PID, and ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''R'', and ''d'' is a greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'',\nthen there are elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R'' such that ''ax'' + ''by'' = ''d''. The reason: the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''Ra''+''Rb'' is principal and indeed is equal to ''Rd''.\n\nAn integral domain in which B\u00e9zout's identity holds is called a [[B\u00e9zout domain]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[French people|French]] [[mathematician]] [[\u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout]] (1730\u20131783) proved this identity for polynomials.<ref>{{cite book |author=B\u00e9zout, \u00c9.|authorlink=\u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoxbAAAAQAAJ&hl=en&pg=PP5 |title=Th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des \u00e9quations alg\u00e9briques |place=Paris, France |publisher=Ph.-D.

The series was part of the rotating ''[[The NBC Mystery Movie|NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie]]'' anthology. It alternated in its time slot with several other shows, but was the only one of them to last beyond its first season.\n\n==Premise==\nPeppard played Thomas Banacek, a suave, [[Polish-American]] freelance [[Private investigator|investigator]] based in [[Boston]], who solved seemingly impossible thefts (see [[locked room mystery]]). He then collected from the insurance companies 10% of the insured value of the recovered property. One of Banacek's verbal signatures was the quotation of strangely worded yet curiously cogent \"[[Poland|Polish]]\" proverbs such as:\n* \"If you're not sure that it's potato [[borscht]], there could be orphans working in the mines.\"\n* \"Though the hippopotamus has no sting, the wise man would prefer to be sat upon by the bee.\"\n* \"A truly wise man never plays leapfrog with a unicorn.\"\n* \"When a wolf is chasing your sleigh, throw him a raisin cookie, but don't stop to bake a cake.\"\n* \"Just because the cat has her kittens in the oven doesn't make them biscuits.\"\n* \"You can read all the books in the library my son, but the cheese will still stink after four days.\"\n* \"No matter how warm the smile on the face of the Sun, the cat still has her kittens under the porch.\"\n* \"Even a one thousand zloty note cannot tap dance.\"\n\nPart of the joke was that Ralph Manza as Banacek's [[chauffeur]] Jay Drury, would often ask \"What does it mean, Boss?\" Banacek also had a running agreement with his chauffeur for a 10% share of Banacek's 10% if he solved the crime.  Mr. Drury was never at a loss for a potential solution which Banacek would always manage to shoot down with his very next line.  Another recurring gag was for other characters to mispronounce his name, often, particularly in the case of rivals, deliberately. The name \"Banaczek\" (as pronounced in the show) is actually quite rare in Poland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Polish Surnames Database|url=http://nazwiska-polskie.pl/Banaczek|website=nazwiska-polskie.pl}}</ref>\n\nAlso featured were [[Murray Matheson]] as rare-bookstore owner and information source Felix Mulholland and [[Christine Belford]] as Carlie Kirkland, Banacek's sometime-lover and always-rival. Felix was the series' only character to ever call Banacek by his first name.\n\nBanacek's success as an investigator allowed him to live well. He had a mansion at 85 Mt. Vernon Street, (the same house used in ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' starring [[Steve McQueen]])<ref>{{Citation|title=The Thomas Crown Affair (1968)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063688/locations|accessdate=2018-02-03}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} on Beacon Hill in Boston.  He had a limousine and driver. He owned and drove an antique 1941 [[Packard]] convertible.  He had a [[mobile radio telephone]] in each of his cars at a time when these devices were uncommon and expensive.  Banacek was intelligent, well-educated, cultured and suave.  He was an unapologetic ladies man who enjoyed the company of beautiful women, but he was street-smart and could engage in violent hand-to-hand fighting if the moment called for it.\n\n''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' premise had been that a bored, wealthy Boston businessman (McQueen) masterminds a crime, leading to a match of wits with an insurance investigator ([[Faye Dunaway]]) who collects a 10 percent fee from the insurance company if she solves the case. ''Banacek'' borrowed elements of both characters and plot points.\n\n==Production==\nIn general, the series was shot on the [[Universal Studios]] backlot, though location scenes were filmed around Los Angeles in areas that could pass for Boston, or rural areas near there.  The episode titled \"If Max Is So Smart, Why Doesn't He Tell Us Where He Is?\" was shot on location at the [[California Institute of the Arts]] around the time the school first opened. \"Ten Thousand Dollars A Page\" was filmed at the Pasadena Art Museum, later known as the Pasadena Museum of Modern Art and now the [[Norton Simon Museum of Art]].\n\nA customized 1969 [[American Motors]] AMX was built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] for the second regular-season episode.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.barris.com/carsgallery/tvmovie/amx400.php |title='Banacek' AMX 400 |work=Barris Custom |date=2013 |accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref> The car became known as the [[AMC AMX#AMX-400|AMX-400]] and it is now owned by an automobile collector.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/amx-400-custom-car.htm |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=AMX-400: Profile of a Custom Car |date=23 September 2007 |work=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref>  Other continuing cars in the series were a 1941 [[Packard 180]] with a Victoria body designed by Howard \"Dutch\" Darrin (license plate number 178344),<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rmsothebys.com/mb08/vintage-motor-cars-of-meadow-brook/lots/1942-packard-one-eighty-convertible-victoria-by-darrin/291964 |title=1942 Packard One-Eighty Convertible Victoria by Darrin |work=Sothebys |date=2 August 2008  |accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref> a 1973 Corvette (driven by Ms. Kirkland) and a 1973 [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] [[limousine]] ([[mobile telephone]] number KL 17811).  In keeping with both the exotic car theme and the humor between Banacek and his driver Jay Drury, he was even chauffeured around in a  [[Willys MB]], [[Jeep CJ]]2A,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle.php?id=146267 |title=Willys MB 'Jeep' |work=imcdb.org |accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref> and a CJ6,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_243643-Jeep-CJ-6.html |title=Jeep CJ-6  |work=imcdb.org |accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref> as well as a brand new Ford/[[De Tomaso Pantera]].\n\nIn preparation for both the pilot, first, and then the second seasons, the cast went to Boston and filmed a variety of background scenes.  These scenes were then used through the series and are especially shown in the opening scenes, including Banacek rowing on the [[Charles River]] and walking through [[Government Center, Boston|Government Center]].  In the pilot, Banacek's car pulls into his Beacon Hill home, the historic [[Second Harrison Gray Otis House]] located at 85 Mount Vernon Street. In other episodes, views are shown of the [[Public Garden (Boston)|Public Garden]], the entry to Felix's bookstore at 50 [[Beacon Street]], and the [[Esplanade, Boston|Esplanade]].  The Boston-filmed pieces were done by a [[second unit]] and directed by Peppard himself.\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough the show had a mixture of humor and rather intricate plots, it never generated strong ratings. Despite this, the show was well received by critics. In addition, the [[Polish American Congress]] gave the series an award for portraying Polish Americans in a good manner.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013Present|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=85}}</ref>\n\n==Cancellation==\n''Banacek'' was well received by television critics, and as a result was picked up for a third season. However, before the third season could start, Peppard quit the show to prevent his ex-wife [[Elizabeth Ashley]] from receiving a larger percentage of his earnings as part of their divorce settlement. The complication ended any chance of reviving ''Banacek'' during Peppard's lifetime.
