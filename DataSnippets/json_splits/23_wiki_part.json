Born on lands likely belonging to the Monkwearmouth monastery in present day Sunderland, Bede was sent there at the age of seven and later joined Abbot Ceolfrith at the Jarrow monastery, both of whom survived a plague that struck in 686, an outbreak that killed a majority of the population there. While he spent most of his life in the monastery, Bede travelled to several abbeys and monasteries across the British Isles, even visiting the archbishop of York and King Ceolwulf of Northumbria. He is well known as an author, teacher (a student of one of his pupils was [[Alcuin]]), and scholar, and his most famous work, ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', gained him the title \"The Father of [[History of England|English History]]\". His ecumenical writings were extensive and included a number of Biblical commentaries and other theological works of exegetical erudition. Another important area of study for Bede was the academic discipline of ''computus'', otherwise known to his contemporaries as the science of calculating calendar dates. One of the more important dates Bede tried to compute was Easter, an effort that was mired with controversy. He also helped establish the practice of dating forward from the birth of Christ (''[[Anno Domini]]'' \u2013 in the year of our Lord), a practice which eventually became commonplace in medieval Europe. Bede was one of the greatest teachers and writers of the [[Early Middle Ages]] and is considered by many historians to be the single most important scholar of antiquity for the period between the death of [[Pope Gregory I]] in 604 and the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] in 800.\n\nIn 1899, [[Pope Leo XIII]] declared him a [[Doctor of the Church]]. He is the only native of [[Great Britain]] to achieve this designation; [[Anselm of Canterbury]], also a Doctor of the Church, was originally from [[Italy]]. Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator, and his work made the [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] writings of the early [[Church Fathers]] much more accessible to his fellow [[Anglo-Saxons]], which contributed significantly to English [[Christianity]]. Bede's monastery had access to an impressive library which included works by [[Eusebius]], [[Orosius]], and many others.\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Opera Bedae Venerabilis.tif|thumb|''Opera Bedae Venerabilis'' (1563)]]\nAlmost everything that is known of Bede's life is contained in the last chapter of his ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', a history of the church in England.

The ''Liber Vitae'' of [[Durham Cathedral]] names two priests with this name, one of whom is presumably Bede himself.

The ''Life of Ceolfrith'', written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith. The two managed to do the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained.

W. Jones, pp. 307\u2013315}} Bede had another brush with Wilfrid, for the historian himself says that he met Wilfrid, sometime between 706 and 709, and discussed [[\u00c6thelthryth]], the abbess of Ely. Wilfrid had been present at the exhumation of her body in 695, and Bede questioned the bishop about the exact circumstances of the body and asked for more details of her life, as Wilfrid had been her advisor.<ref name=Goffart322>Goffart, ''Narrators'' p. 322</ref>\n\nIn 733, Bede travelled to York to visit Ecgbert, who was then [[archbishop of York|bishop of York]].

According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill, \"with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain\", before Easter. On the Tuesday, two days before Bede died, his breathing became worse and his feet swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day. At three o'clock, according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and distributed among the priests of the monastery \"a few treasures\" of his: \"some pepper, and napkins, and some incense\". That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards.<ref name=\"ColgraveMynors1969pp580-587\">{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=580\u2013587}}</ref> The account of Cuthbert does not make entirely clear whether Bede died before midnight or after.

He acknowledges two other lives of saints directly; one is a life of [[Saint Fursey|Fursa]], and the other of St. [[\u00c6thelburh of Barking|\u00c6thelburh]]; the latter no longer survives.<ref name=Plummer_I_xxiv>Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historic'', vol.

Albinus, the abbot of the monastery in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and with the assistance of [[Nothelm|Nothhelm]], at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of [[Gregory the Great]]'s correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=Farmer_25/><ref name=BEASE_Nothhelm>Keynes, \"Nothhelm\", pp.&nbsp;335&nbsp;336.</ref> Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters.<ref name=ODNB/> Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'';<ref name=\"HE_pref\">Bede, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Preface, p.&nbsp;42.</ref> he was in contact with [[Daniel of Winchester|Daniel]], the Bishop of Winchester, for information about the history of the church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at [[Lastingham]] for information about [[Cedd]] and [[Chad of Mercia|Chad]].<ref name=HE_pref/> Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop [[Kinebertus|Cynibert]] for information about Lindsey.<ref name=HE_pref/>\n\nThe historian [[Walter Goffart]] argues that Bede based the structure of the ''Historia'' on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured. For the early part of the work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used [[Gildas]]'s ''De excidio''. The second section, detailing the [[Gregorian mission]] of [[Augustine of Canterbury]] was framed on the anonymous ''Life of Gregory the Great'' written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels were modelled on [[Eddius|Stephen of Ripon]]'s ''Life of Wilfrid''.<ref name=Goffart296>{{harvnb|Goffart|1988| pp=296\u2013307}}</ref> Most of Bede's informants for information after Augustine's mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence.<ref name=Deconstruct7>{{harvnb|Brooks |2006|pp=7\u201310}}</ref><ref name=Deconstruct12>{{harvnb|Brooks |2006|pp=12\u201314}}</ref>\n\n=== Models and style ===\nBede's stylistic models included some of the same authors from whom he drew the material for the earlier parts of his history. His introduction imitates the work of Orosius,<ref name=ODNB/> and his title is an echo of Eusebius's ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''.<ref name=ASEEncBede/> Bede also followed Eusebius in taking the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' as the model for the overall work: where Eusebius used the ''Acts'' as the theme for his description of the development of the church, Bede made it the model for his history of the Anglo-Saxon church.<ref name=Farmer_26>{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=26}}</ref> Bede quoted his sources at length in his narrative, as Eusebius had done.<ref name=ODNB/> Bede also appears to have taken quotes directly from his correspondents at times. For example, he almost always uses the terms \"Australes\" and \"Occidentales\" for the South and West Saxons respectively, but in a passage in the first book he uses \"Meridiani\" and \"Occidui\" instead, as perhaps his informant had done.<ref name=ODNB/> At the end of the work, Bede added a brief autobiographical note; this was an idea taken from [[Gregory of Tours]]' earlier ''History of the Franks''.<ref name=Farmer_27>{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=27}}</ref>\n\nBede's work as a [[hagiography|hagiographer]], and his detailed attention to dating, were both useful preparations for the task of writing the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''. His interest in [[computus]], the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also useful in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date.<ref name=Farmer_21 />\n\nBede is described by [[Michael Lapidge]] as \"without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period\".<ref>{{harvnb|Lapidge|2005|p=323}}</ref> His Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' is not simple. He knew rhetoric, and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as they often do on the connotations of the Latin words. However, unlike contemporaries such as [[Aldhelm]], whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede's own text is easy to read.<ref name=CM_xxxvii>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxxvii\u2013xxxviii}}</ref> In the words of Charles Plummer, one of the best-known editors of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Bede's Latin is \"clear and limpid&nbsp;... it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence&nbsp;... Alcuin rightly praises Bede for his unpretending style.\"<ref name=Plummer_I_liii>Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol. I, pp.&nbsp;liii\u2013liv.</ref>\n\n=== Intent ===\nBede's primary intention in writing the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was to show the growth of the united church throughout England. The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; by the end of the ''Historia'' the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons.<ref name=CM_xxx>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxx\u2013xxxi}}</ref> This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the ''Historia'' is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664.<ref name=Farmer_27/> Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing. He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote.<ref name=\"CM_xxx\"/>\n\nN.J. Higham argues that Bede designed his work to promote his reform agenda to Ceolwulf, the Northumbrian king. Bede painted a highly optimistic picture of the current situation in the Church, as opposed to the more pessimistic picture found in his private letters.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Higham | first1 = N.J. | year = 2013 | title = Bede's Agenda in Book IV of the 'Ecclesiastical History of the English People': A Tricky Matter of Advising the King | url = | journal = Journal of Ecclesiastical History | volume = 64 | issue = 3| pages = 476\u2013493 | doi=10.1017/s0022046913000523}}</ref>\n\nBede's extensive use of miracles can prove difficult for readers who consider him a more or less reliable historian, but do not accept the possibility of miracles.\nYet both reflect an inseparable integrity and regard for accuracy and truth, expressed in terms both of historical events and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues to the present day. Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the ''Historia'', felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and that as a result miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct.<ref name=CM_xxxiv>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxxiv\u2013xxxvi}}</ref>\n\n=== Omissions and biases ===\nBede is somewhat reticent about the career of [[Wilfrid]], a contemporary and one of the most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.<ref name=Farmer_31/>\n\nBede's account of the early migrations of the Angles and Saxons to England omits any mention of a movement of those peoples across the channel from Britain to Brittany described by [[Procopius]], who was writing in the sixth century. [[Frank Stenton]] describes this omission as \"a scholar's dislike of the indefinite\"; traditional material that could not be dated or used for Bede's didactic purposes had no interest for him.<ref name=\"Stenton_8\u20139\">{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nBede was a Northumbrian, and this tinged his work with a local bias.<ref name=JMWH_xxxi>{{harvnb|Wallace-Hadrill|1988|p=xxxi}}</ref> The sources to which he had access gave him less information about the west of England than for other areas.<ref name=TCOB_119>{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|p=119}}</ref> He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of [[Boniface]], a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent. He also is parsimonious in his praise for [[Aldhelm]], a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held ''imperium'', or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, [[Ceawlin]], is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held.<ref name=\"TCOB_21\u20132\">{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|pp=21\u201322}}</ref> Historian [[Robin Fleming]] states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2011|p=111}}</ref>\n\nBede relates the story of Augustine's mission from Rome, and tells how the British clergy refused to assist Augustine in the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. This, combined with Gildas's negative assessment of the British church at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions, led Bede to a very critical view of the native church. However, Bede ignores the fact that at the time of Augustine's mission, the history between the two was one of warfare and conquest, which, in the words of [[Barbara Yorke]], would have naturally \"curbed any missionary impulses towards the Anglo-Saxons from the British clergy.\"<ref name=TCOB_118>{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|p=118}}</ref>\n\n=== Use of ''Anno Domini'' ===\nAt the time Bede wrote the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', there were two common ways of referring to dates. One was to use [[indiction]]s, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years\u2014the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date would have to be given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' method invented by [[Dionysius Exiguus]].<ref name=CM_xviii>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xviii\u2013xix}}</ref> Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in ''De Temporum Ratione'', his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used.<ref name=CM_xviii/><ref name=Stenton_186>{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|p=186}}</ref> [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle]], contained in ''De Temporum Ratione'', was developed from Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 famous Easter table.\n\n=== Assessment ===\nThe ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was copied often in the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive. About half of those are located on the European continent, rather than in the British Isles.<ref name=Companion4/> Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede's ''Historia'' come from the northern parts of the [[Carolingian]] Empire.<ref name=Reread21>{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=21}}</ref> This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at [[Strasbourg, France]].<ref name=Companion4>{{harvnb|Wright|2008|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> Modern historians have studied the ''Historia'' extensively, and a number of editions have been produced.<ref name=Nar236/> For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the ''Historia'', but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the ''Historia'' was the culmination of Bede's works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars.<ref name=Nar238>{{harvnb|Goffart |1988|pp= 238\u20139}}</ref>\n\nModern historians and editors of Bede have been lavish in their praise of his achievement in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''. Stenton regarded it as one of the \"small class of books which transcend all but the most fundamental conditions of time and place\", and regarded its quality as dependent on Bede's \"astonishing power of co-ordinating the fragments of information which came to him through tradition, the relation of friends, or documentary evidence&nbsp;... In an age where little was attempted beyond the registration of fact, he had reached the conception of history.\"<ref name= Stenton_187>{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|p=187}}</ref> [[Patrick Wormald]] described him as \"the first and greatest of England's historians\".<ref name=Worm29>{{harvnb|Wormald|1999|p= 29}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' has given Bede a high reputation, but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history.<ref name=ODNB/> His focus on the history of the organisation of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church.<ref name=ODNB/> Besides the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', the medieval writers [[William of Malmesbury]], [[Henry of Huntingdon]], and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] used his works as sources and inspirations.<ref name=Reread27>{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=27}}</ref> Early modern writers, such as [[Polydore Vergil]] and [[Matthew Parker]], the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilised the ''Historia'', and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion.<ref name=Reread33>{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=33}}</ref>\n\nSome historians have questioned the reliability of some of Bede's accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, thinks that the ''Historia's'' account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should not be considered to relate what actually happened, but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bede's time.<ref name=Behr>{{harvnb|Behr|2000|pp=25\u201352}}</ref>\n\nIt is likely that Bede's work, because it was so widely copied, discouraged others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.<ref name=Plummer_I_xlvii>Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol. I, p.&nbsp;xlvii and note.</ref>\n\n== Other historical works ==\n[[File:Athelstan.jpg|thumb|upright|A page from a copy of Bede's ''Lives of St. Cuthbert'', showing [[Athelstan of England|King Athelstan]] presenting the work to the saint. This manuscript was given to St. Cuthbert's shrine in 934.<ref name=OIHBM_42>{{harvnb|Cannon|Griffiths|1997 |pp=42\u201343}}</ref>]]\n\n=== Chronicles ===\nAs Chapter 66 of his ''On the Reckoning of Time'', in 725 Bede wrote the ''Greater Chronicle'' (''chronica maiora''), which sometimes circulated as a separate work. For recent events the ''Chronicle'', like his ''Ecclesiastical History'', relied upon Gildas, upon a version of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' current at least to the papacy of [[Pope Sergius I]] (687\u2013701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on [[Eusebius]]'s ''Chronikoi Kanones.'' The dating of events in the ''Chronicle'' is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the ''[[Anno Mundi]]''.<ref>Wallis (trans.), ''The Reckoning of Time'', pp. lxvii\u2013lxxi, 157\u2013237, 353\u201366</ref>\n\n=== Lives ===\nHis other historical works included lives of the abbots of [[Jarrow#Wearmouth-Jarrow Priory|Wearmouth and Jarrow]], as well as verse and prose lives of [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne]], an adaptation of [[Paulinus of Nola]]'s ''Life of St Felix'', and a translation of the Greek ''Passion of [[Saint Anastasius|St Anastasius]]''. He also created a listing of saints, the ''Martyrology''.<ref name=Goffart245>{{harvnb|Goffart |1988|pp=245\u2013246}}</ref>\n\n== Theological works ==\nIn his own time, Bede was as well known for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, as well as other theological, works. The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but a few were lost.<ref name=BedeVen42>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=42}}</ref> It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of ''Doctor Anglorum'', and why he was declared a saint.<ref name=Theo>{{harvnb|Ward |2001|pp=57\u201364}}</ref>\n\nBede synthesised and transmitted the learning from his predecessors, as well as made careful, judicious innovation in knowledge (such as recalculating the age of the earth\u2014for which he was censured before surviving the heresy accusations and eventually having his views championed by Archbishop Ussher in the sixteenth century\u2014see below) that had theological implications. In order to do this, he learned Greek, and attempted to learn Hebrew. He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments. He mentions that he studied from a text of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate]], which itself was from the Hebrew text. He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church. In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians, including works by [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]], [[John Cassian|Cassian]], [[John Chrysostom]], [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Origen]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Jerome]], [[Pope Gregory I]], [[Ambrose of Milan]], [[Cassiodorus]], and [[Cyprian]].<ref name=CM_xxv/><ref name=Theo/> He used these, in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves, to write his commentaries and other theological works.<ref name=Theo/> He had a Latin translation by [[Evagrius of Antioch|Evagrius]] of [[Athanasius]]'s ''Life of Antony'', and a copy of [[Sulpicius Severus]]' ''Life of St. Martin''.<ref name=CM_xxv/> He also used lesser known writers, such as [[Fulgentius of Ruspe|Fulgentius]], [[Julian of Eclanum]], [[Tyconius]], and [[Prosper of Aquitaine]]. Bede was the first to refer to Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin [[Fathers of the Church]].<ref name=Ward44>{{harvnb|Ward|1990|p=44}}</ref> It is clear from Bede's own comments that he felt his calling was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers.<ref name=Mey827>{{harvnb|Meyvaert|1996|p=827}}</ref>\n\nBede also wrote homilies, works written to explain theology used in worship services. Bede wrote homilies not only on the major Christian seasons such as [[Advent]], [[Lent]], or Easter, but on other subjects such as anniversaries of significant events.<ref name=Theo/>\n\nBoth types of Bede's theological works circulated widely in the Middle Ages. A number of his biblical commentaries were incorporated into the ''[[Glossa Ordinaria]]'', an 11th-century collection of biblical commentaries. Some of Bede's homilies were collected by [[Paul the Deacon]], and they were used in that form in the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Monastic Office]]. [[Saint Boniface]] used Bede's homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent.<ref name=Theo/>\n\nBede sometimes included in his theological books an acknowledgement of the predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave the details of his sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers\u2014he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all to be found in the Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Encyclopedia]]'', for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his ''De temporum ratione''.<ref name=BLTW_Laistner>M.L.W.

Due to his innovations in computing the age of the world, he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop [[Wilfrid]], his chronology being contrary to accepted calculations. Once informed of the accusations of these \"lewd rustics,\" Bede refuted them in his Letter to Plegwin.<ref name=\"Bede2004ppxxx\">{{harvnb|Bede|2004|pp=xxx, 405\u2013415}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to these works on astronomical timekeeping, he also wrote ''De natura rerum'', or ''On the Nature of Things'', modelled in part after the work of the same title by [[Isidore of Seville]].<ref name=BedeVen36>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=36}}</ref> His works were so influential that late in the 9th century [[Notker the Stammerer]], a monk of the [[Abbey of St. Gall|Monastery of St. Gall]] in Switzerland, wrote that \"God, the orderer of natures, who raised the Sun from the East on the fourth day of Creation, in the sixth day of the world has made Bede rise from the West as a new Sun to illuminate the whole Earth\".<ref name=\"Bede2004plxxxv\">{{harvnb|Bede|2004|p=lxxxv}}</ref>\n\n== Educational works ==\nBede wrote some works designed to help teach grammar in the abbey school. One of these was his ''De arte metrica'', a discussion of the composition of Latin verse, drawing on previous grammarians work. It was based on Donatus' ''De pedibus'' and [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]' ''De finalibus'', and used examples from Christian poets as well as Virgil. It became a standard text for the teaching of Latin verse during the next few centuries. Bede dedicated this work to Cuthbert, apparently a student, for he is named \"beloved son\" in the dedication, and Bede says \"I have laboured to educate you in divine letters and ecclesiastical statutes\"<ref name=BedeVen31>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|pp=31\u201332}}</ref> Another textbook of Bede's is the ''De orthographia'', a work on [[orthography]], designed to help a medieval reader of Latin with unfamiliar abbreviations and words from classical Latin works. Although it could serve as a textbook, it appears to have been mainly intended as a reference work. The exact date of composition for both of these works is unknown.<ref name=BedeVen35>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|pp=35\u201336}}</ref>\n\nAnother educational work is ''De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae'', which discusses the Bible's use of rhetoric.<ref name=ODNB/> Bede was familiar with pagan authors such as Virgil, but it was not considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts, and in ''De schematibus&nbsp;...'' Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=CM_xxvi>Colgrave gives the example of [[Desiderius of Vienne]], who was reprimanded by Gregory the Great for using \"heathen\" authors in his teaching.</ref> Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\n== Vernacular poetry ==\nAccording to his disciple Cuthbert, Bede was also ''doctus in nostris carminibus'' (\"learned in our songs\"). Cuthbert's letter on Bede's death, the ''Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae'', moreover, commonly is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as ''Bede's Death Song''\n{{quote|\nAnd he used to repeat that sentence from [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] \"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,\" and many other verses of Scripture, urging us thereby to awake from the slumber of the soul by thinking in good time of our last hour. And in our own language,\u2014for he was familiar with English poetry,\u2014speaking of the soul's dread departure from the body:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ang|Fore \u00f0\u00e6m nedfere n\u00e6nig wior\u00f0e\n\u00f0onc snottora \u00f0on him \u00f0earf si\u00e6\nto ymbhycgenne \u00e6r his hinionge\nhw\u00e6t his gast\u00e6 godes o\u00f0\u00f0e yfles\n\u00e6fter dea\u00f0 d\u00e6ge doemed wior\u00f0e.}}<ref name=\"ColgraveMynors1969pp580-3\">{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=580\u20133}}</ref>\n|\nFacing that enforced journey, no man can be\nMore prudent than he has good call to be,\nIf he consider, before his going hence,\nWhat for his spirit of good hap or of evil\nAfter his day of death shall be determined.}} }}\n\nAs Opland notes, however, it is not entirely clear that Cuthbert is attributing this text to Bede: most manuscripts of the latter do not use a [[finite verb]] to describe Bede's presentation of the song, and the theme was relatively common in Old English and Anglo-Latin literature. The fact that Cuthbert's description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture, indeed, might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts.<ref name=Opland140>{{harvnb|Opland|1980|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref> On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert's Latin letter, the observation that Bede \"was learned in our song,\" and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it. By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important, either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment<ref name=Mccready14>{{harvnb|McCready|1994|pp=14\u201319}}</ref> or because it is a direct quotation of Bede's last original composition.<ref name=Opland14>{{harvnb|Opland|1980|p=14}}</ref>\n\n== Veneration ==\n[[File:Depiction of St. Bede the Venerable (at St. Bede's school, Chennai) - Image has been cropped for better presentation.jpg|thumb|upright|Bede depicted at St. Bede's school, [[Chennai]]]]\n\nThere is no evidence for cult being paid to Bede in England in the 8th century. One reason for this may be that he died on the feast day of [[Augustine of Canterbury]]. Later, when he was [[veneration|venerated]] in England, he was either commemorated after Augustine on 26 May, or his feast was moved to 27 May. However, he was venerated outside England, mainly through the efforts of [[Saint Boniface|Boniface]] and [[Alcuin]], both of whom promoted the cult on the Continent. Boniface wrote repeatedly back to England during his missionary efforts, requesting copies of Bede's theological works. Alcuin, who was taught at the school set up in York by Bede's pupil [[Ecgbert (bishop)|Egbert]], praised Bede as an example for monks to follow and was instrumental in disseminating Bede's works to all of Alcuin's friends.<ref name=Ward136>{{harvnb|Ward|1990| pp=136\u2013138}}</ref> Bede's cult became prominent in England during the 10th-century revival of monasticism, and by the 14th century had spread to many of the cathedrals of England. [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester]] (c. 1008\u20131095) was a particular devotee of Bede's, dedicating a church to him in 1062, which was Wulfstan's first undertaking after his consecration as bishop.<ref name=Ward139>{{harvnb|Ward|1990| p=139}}</ref>\n\nHis body was '[[translation (relic)|translated]]' (the ecclesiastical term for relocation of relics) from Jarrow to Durham Cathedral around 1020, where it was placed in the same tomb with Saint [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne]]. Later Bede's remains were moved to a shrine in the Galilee Chapel at [[Durham Cathedral]] in 1370. The shrine was destroyed during the [[English Reformation]], but the bones were reburied in the chapel. In 1831 the bones were dug up and then reburied in a new tomb, which is still there.<ref name=Companion4pic>{{harvnb|Wright|2008|p=4 (caption)}}</ref> Other [[relic]]s were claimed by [[York Minster|York]], [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]]<ref name=\"Farmer2004p47-48\"/> and [[Fulda]].<ref name=Reread24>{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=24}}</ref>\n\nHis scholarship and importance to Catholicism were recognised in 1899 when he was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]].<ref name=ODNB/> He is the only Englishman named a Doctor of the Church.<ref name=SHMI /><ref name=Companion4/> He is also the only Englishman in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradise]]'' (''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' X.130), mentioned among theologians and doctors of the church in the same canto as [[Isidore of Seville]] and the Scot [[Richard of St. Victor]].\n\nHis feast day was included in the [[General Roman Calendar]] in 1899, for celebration on 27 May rather than on his date of death, 26 May, which was then the feast day of [[Pope Gregory VII|Pope Saint Gregory VII]]. He is venerated in both the Anglican and Roman Catholic Church, with a feast day of 25 May,<ref name=Companion4/> and in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with a feast day on 27 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oca.org/saints/lives/2014/05/27/103796-venerable-bede-the-church-historian|title=Venerable Bede, the Church Historian|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBede became known as ''[[Venerable]] Bede'' (Lat.: Beda Venerabilis) by the 9th century<ref name=Companion3>{{harvnb|Wright|2008|p=3}}</ref> because of his holiness,<ref name=SHMI /> but this was not linked to consideration for [[Canonization|sainthood]] by the Roman Catholic Church.

The two most popular varieties are black pearl milk tea and green pearl milk tea. <ref name=\"chang12\" /> \n\n==Description==\n\nBoba teas fall under two categories: teas (without milk) and [[milk tea]]s. Both varieties come with a choice of black, green, or oolong tea, and come in many flavors (both fruit and non-fruit). Milk teas include either condensed milk, powdered milk, or fresh milk. Some shops offer non-dairy creamer options as well. In addition, many boba shops sell Asian style smoothies, which include a dairy base and either fresh fruit or fruit-flavored powder (but no tea). Now, there are hot versions available at most shops as well.  \n\nThe oldest known bubble tea consisted of a mixture of hot [[Taiwanese cuisine|Taiwanese]] [[black tea]], small [[tapioca|tapioca pearls]] (\u7c89\u5713), [[condensed milk]], and syrup (\u7cd6\u6f3f) or honey. Many variations followed; the most common are served cold rather than hot. The most prevalent varieties of tea have changed frequently.\n\nBubble tea first became popular in Taiwan in the 1980s, although no one knows for sure who actually invented it first. Larger tapioca pearls (\u6ce2\u9738/\u9ed1\u73cd\u73e0) were adapted and quickly replaced the small pearls.<ref name=\"\u73cd\u73e0\u5976\u8336\u7684\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\" /> Soon after, different flavors, especially fruit flavors, became popular. Flavors may be added in the form of powder, pulp, or syrup to oolong, black or green tea, which is then shaken with ice in a [[cocktail shaker]]. The tea mixture is then poured into a cup with the toppings in it. \n\nToday, one can find shops entirely devoted to bubble tea.<ref>{{cite news|date= October 7, 2004| url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/10/7/whose-boba-is-best-the-new/ |title=Whose Boba Is Best? |magazine= The Harvard Crimson }}</ref> Some caf\u00e9s use plastic lids, but more authentic bubble tea shops serve drinks using a machine to seal the top of the cup with plastic cellophane. The latter method allows the tea to be shaken in the serving cup and makes it spill-free until one is ready to drink it. The cellophane is then pierced with an oversize straw large enough to allow the toppings to pass through. Today, in Taiwan, it is most common for people to refer to the drink as pearl milk tea (zh\u0113n zh\u016b n\u01cei ch\u00e1, or zh\u0113n n\u01cei for short). Pearl milk tea may be used by English speakers and overseas Chinese and Taiwanese speakers, but it is usually called \"bubble tea\" or \"boba tea\" by English speakers, with the former seemingly more common in locations with less Chinese influence. In parts of California and other areas with a relatively large Asian population, the drink is often referred to simply as \"boba\" for short. \n\n===Variants===\nEach of the ingredients of bubble tea can have many variations depending on the tea store. Typically, different types of black tea, [[green tea]], and sometimes white tea are used. Another variation called [[Yuenyeung (drink)|yuenyeung]] (\u9d1b\u9d26, named after the [[Mandarin duck]]) originated in Hong Kong and consists of black tea, coffee, and milk. Decaffeinated versions of teas are sometimes available when the tea house freshly brews the tea base.\n\nOther varieties of the drink can include blended tea drinks. Some may be blended with ice cream. There are also smoothies that contain both tea and fruit.\n\nAlthough bubble tea originated in Taiwan, bubble tea 'mash ups' are becoming popular, where inspiration for flavours comes from other cuisines. For example, some places uses hibiscus flowers, saffron, cardamom, or rosewater.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.souschef.co.uk/bureau-of-taste/everything-you-need-to-know-about-bubble-tea/|title=Everything You Need to Know About Bubble Tea -|date=2016-07-27|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-15}}</ref>\n\n[[Tapioca]] balls (boba) are the prevailing chewy tidbits in bubble tea, but a wide range of other options can be used to add similar texture to the drink. These are usually black due to the brown sugar mixed in with the tapioca. Green pearls have a small hint of green tea flavor and are chewier than the traditional tapioca balls. Jelly comes different shapes: small cubes, stars, or rectangular strips, and flavors such as [[nata de coco|coconut jelly]], [[konjac]], [[lychee]], [[grass jelly]], [[mango]], [[coffee]] and [[green tea]] available at some shops. [[Azuki bean]] or [[mung bean]] paste, typical toppings for Taiwanese shaved ice desserts, give the drinks an added subtle flavor as well as texture. [[Aloe]], egg pudding ([[custard]]), and [[sago]] can be found in most tea houses.\n\n[[Popping Boba]] are sphere-shaped and have fruit juices or syrups inside of them. They are also popular toppings. The many flavors include mango, lychee, strawberry, green apple, passion fruit, pomegranate, orange, cantaloupe, blueberry, coffee, chocolate, yogurt, kiwi, peach, banana, lime, cherry, pineapple, red guava, etc.\n\nSome shops offer milk or cheese foam top off the drink too, which has a thicker consistency similar to that of whipped cream.\n\nBubble tea caf\u00e9s will frequently offer drinks without coffee or tea in them. The dairy base for these drinks is flavoring blended with ice, often called snow bubble. All mix-ins that can be added to the bubble tea can be added to these [[slushie]]-like drinks. One drawback is that the coldness of the iced drink may cause the tapioca balls to harden, making them difficult to suck up through a straw and chew. To prevent this from happening, these slushies must be consumed more quickly than bubble tea.\n\nBubble tea stores often give customers the option of choosing the amount of ice or sugar. Bubble tea is also offered in some restaurants.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bubble Tea.png|thumb|100px|Milk Tea]]\nThe most widely accepted story for the origin of bubble tea comes from the Hanlin teahouse in [[Tainan]], [[Taiwan]]. In 1986, in the Ya Mu Liao market, teahouse owner Tu Tsong-he got the inspiration when he saw white tapioca balls. He then made tea using the traditional white tapioca balls, which have the appearance of pearls, supposedly resulting in the so-called \"pearl tea\". Shortly after, Hanlin changed the white tapioca balls to the black version, mixed with brown sugar or honey, that is seen today. At many locations, one can purchase both black tapioca balls and white tapioca balls. An alternative origin is the Chun Shui Tang Teahouse in [[Taichung]], Taiwan. Its founder, Liu Han-Chieh,<ref name=\"Martin 2007 219\"/> observed how the Japanese served cold coffee (while on a visit in the 1980s) and applied this method to tea.<ref name=chang12/> The new style of serving tea propelled his business, and multiple chains were established. This expansion would be the stepping stone for the rapid expansion of bubble tea.<ref name=\"chang12\"/> The creator of bubble tea is Lin Hsiu Hui, the teahouse's product development manager, who randomly poured her fen yuan into the iced tea drink during a boring meeting in 1988.<ref name=\"chang12\"/> The beverage was well received at the meeting, leading to its inclusion on the menu. It ultimately became the franchise's top-selling product.<ref name=chang12/>\n\nThe drink became popular in most parts of [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]] during the 1990s.<ref name=\"\u73cd\u73e0\u5976\u8336\u7684\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\" /> The drink is well received by global consumers from North America, specifically around areas with high populations of Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese. In contemporary times, bubble tea has achieved cultural significance outside of Taiwan in some areas for major East Asian diaspora populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/restaurants/how-boba-became-an-integral-part-of-asian-american-culture-in-los-angeles-7819797|title=How Boba Became an Integral Part of Asian-American Culture in Los Angeles|first=Clarissa|last=Wei|date=16 January 2017|website=laweekly.com}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n* \u6ce1\u6cab\u7d05\u8336 ({{zh|p=p\u00e0om\u00f2 h\u00f3ngch\u00e1|links=no}}): \"Foam red tea\", by direct translation, is the drink that is more appropriate for the more literal name of \"bubble tea\"; the English name, foam tea, is not used much in Asia.

The dangers to Vienna were considerable: the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] and [[Ferdinand de Marsin|Marshal Marsin]]'s forces in [[Bavaria]] threatened from the west, and [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vend\u00f4me|Marshal Vend\u00f4me]]'s large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger with a potential offensive through the [[Brenner Pass]]. Vienna was also under pressure from [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]]'s [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence|Hungarian revolt]] from its eastern approaches. Realising the danger, the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] resolved to alleviate the peril to Vienna by marching his forces south from [[Bedburg]] and help maintain Emperor Leopold within the Grand Alliance.\n\nA combination of deception and skilled administration \u2013 designed to conceal his true destination from friend and foe alike \u2013 enabled Marlborough to march {{convert|400|km|abbr=off}} unhindered from the [[Low Countries]] to the [[River Danube]] in five weeks. [[Battle of Schellenberg|After securing Donauw\u00f6rth on the Danube]], Marlborough sought to engage the Elector's and Marsin's army before [[Camille d'Hostun, duc de Tallard|Marshal Tallard]] could bring reinforcements through the [[Black Forest]]. However, with the Franco-Bavarian commanders reluctant to fight until their numbers were deemed sufficient, the Duke enacted a policy of [[Looting|plundering]] in Bavaria designed to force the issue. The tactic proved unsuccessful, but when Tallard arrived to bolster the Elector's army, and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Prince Eugene]] arrived with reinforcements for the Allies, the two armies finally met on the banks of the Danube in and around the small village of [[Blindheim]], from which the English \"Blenheim\" is derived.\n\nBlenheim was one of the battles that altered the course of the war, which until then was leaning for Louis' coalition, and ended French plans of knocking the Emperor out of the war.{{sfn|Lynn|2013|p=294}} France suffered as many as 38,000 casualties including the commander-in-chief, Marshal Tallard, who was taken captive to England. Before the 1704 campaign ended, the Allies had taken [[Landau]], and the towns of [[Trier]] and [[Traben-Trarbach|Trarbach]] on the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] in preparation for the following year's campaign into France itself. The offensive never materialised as the Grand Alliance's army had to depart the Moselle to defend [[Li\u00e8ge]] from a French counteroffensive.{{sfn|Weigley|2004|p=87}} The war would rage on for another decade.{{sfn|Lynn|2013|p=294}}\n\n==Background==\nBy 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in its fourth year. The previous year had been one of success for France and her allies, most particularly on the [[Danube]], where [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|Marshal Villars]] and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital.<ref name=chandler124>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 124</ref> Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]]'s Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vend\u00f4me's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714'', p. 285</ref> In the courts of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Madrid]], Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]].<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 125</ref>\n\nTo isolate the Danube from any Allied intervention, [[Fran\u00e7ois de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Marshal Villeroi]]'s 46,000 troops were expected to pin the 70,000 Dutch and English troops around [[Maastricht]] in the Low Countries, while General [[Robert Jean Antoine de Franquetot de Coigny|de Coigny]] protected [[Alsace]] against surprise with a further corps.<ref name=chandler124/> The only forces immediately available for Vienna's defence were [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Prince Louis of Baden's]] force of 36,000 stationed in the [[Lines of Stollhofen]]<ref>The Lines of Stollhofen are a military chain of posts designed for the defence of the Rhine Valley. The lines ranged {{convert|20|mi|km}} between Stollhofen, a small village on the Rhine, to the Black Forest. The barrier was designed to stop the French marching down the Rhine from Strasbourg.</ref> to watch Marshal Tallard at Strasbourg; there was also a weak force of 10,000 men under [[Hermann Otto II of Limburg Stirum|Field Marshal Count Limburg Styrum]] observing [[Ulm]].\n\nBoth the Imperial Austrian Ambassador in London, [[John Wenceslau Wratislaw von Mitrowitz|Count Wratislaw]], and the Duke of Marlborough realised the implications of the situation on the Danube. The Dutch, however, who clung to their troops for their country's protection, were against any adventurous military operation as far south as the Danube and would never willingly permit any major weakening of the forces in the [[Spanish Netherlands]].<ref name=chandler127>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 127</ref> Marlborough, realising the only way to ignore Dutch wishes was by the use of secrecy and guile, set out to deceive his Dutch allies by pretending to simply move his troops to the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] \u2013 a plan approved of by [[The Hague]] \u2013 but once there, he would slip the Dutch leash and link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany.<ref name=chandler127/> \"My intentions\", wrote the Duke from The Hague on 29 April to his governmental confidant, [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Sidney Godolphin]], \"are to march with the English to [[Koblenz|Coblenz]] and declare that I intend to campaign on the Moselle. But when I come there, to write to the Dutch States that I think it absolutely necessary for the saving of the Empire to march with the troops under my command and to join with those that are in Germany ... in order to make measures with Prince Lewis of Baden for the speedy reduction of the Elector of Bavaria.\"<ref name=Falkner1>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 18</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Protagonists march to the Danube===\n:''A scarlet caterpillar, upon which all eyes were at once fixed, began to crawl steadfastly day by day across the map of Europe, dragging the whole war with it.'' \u2013 [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 136</ref>\n\n[[Image:March to the Danube 1704.png|thumb|300px|The [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]]'s march from [[Bedburg]] (near [[Cologne]]) to the [[Danube]]. His 250-mile (400-kilometre) march to prevent [[Vienna]] falling into enemy hands was a masterpiece of deception, meticulous planning and organisation.]]\n\nMarlborough's march started on 19 May from Bedburg, {{convert|32|km}} north-west of Cologne. The army (assembled by the Duke's brother, General [[Charles Churchill (British Army general)|Charles Churchill]]) consisted of 66 [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadrons]], 31 [[battalions]] and 38 guns and mortars totalling 21,000 men (16,000 of whom were [[Kingdom of England|English]] troops).<ref name=chandler128>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 128. The initial force of 21,000 men were accompanied by 1,700 supply carts drawn by 5,000 draught horses. The artillery needed as many more.</ref> This force was to be augmented ''en route'' such that by the time Marlborough reached the Danube, it would number 40,000 (47 battalions, 88 squadrons). Whilst Marlborough led his army, [[Henry de Nassau, Lord Overkirk|General Overkirk]] would maintain a defensive position in the [[Dutch Republic]] in case Villeroi mounted an attack. The Duke had assured the Dutch that if the French were to launch an offensive he would return in good time, but Marlborough calculated that as he marched south, the French commander would be drawn after him.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 19</ref> In this assumption Marlborough proved correct: Villeroi shadowed the Duke with 30,000 men in 60 squadrons and 42 battalions.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 129. Barnett and Coxe states 45 squadrons and 36 battalions.</ref>\n\nThe military dangers in such an enterprise were numerous: Marlborough's lines of communication along the Rhine would be hopelessly exposed to French interference, for Louis' generals controlled the left bank of the river and its central reaches. Such a long march would almost certainly involve a high wastage of men and horses through exhaustion and disease. However, Marlborough was convinced of the urgency \u2013 \"I am very sensible that I take a great deal upon me\", he had earlier written to Godolphin, \"but should I act otherwise, the Empire would be undone ...\"\n[[File:John Churchill Marlborough portr\u00e4tterad av Adriaen van der Werff (1659-1722).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of the Duke of Marlborough by [[Adriaen van der Werff]] (December 1704) [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nWhilst Allied preparations had progressed, the French were striving to maintain and re-supply Marshal Marsin. Marsin had been operating with the Elector of Bavaria against the Imperial commander, Prince Louis of Baden, and was somewhat isolated from France: his only lines of communication lay through the rocky passes of the Black Forest. However, on 14 May, with considerable skill Marshal Tallard managed to bring 10,000 reinforcements and vast supplies and munitions through the difficult terrain, whilst outmanoeuvring Baron Th\u00fcngen, the Imperial general who sought to block his path.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 20. Falkner gives a total of 8,000</ref> Tallard then returned with his own force to the Rhine, once again side-stepping Th\u00fcngen's efforts to intercept him. The whole operation was an outstanding military achievement.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 20, although Chandler p. 131 states that many men were lost on the return journey through desertion.</ref>\n\nOn 26 May, Marlborough reached Coblenz, where the Moselle meets the Rhine. If he intended an attack along the Moselle the Duke must now turn west, but, instead, the following day the army crossed to the right bank of the Rhine, (pausing to add 5,000 waiting [[Hanoverians]] and [[Prussia]]ns).<ref>Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 31</ref> \"There will be no campaign on the Moselle\", wrote Villeroi who had taken up a defensive position on the river, \"the English have all gone up into Germany.\"<ref name=falkner22>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 22</ref> A second possible objective now occurred to the French \u2013 an Allied incursion into Alsace and an attack on the city of [[Strasbourg]]. Marlborough skilfully encouraged this apprehension by constructing bridges across the Rhine at [[Philippsburg]], a ruse that not only encouraged Villeroi to come to Tallard's aid in the defence of Alsace, but one that ensured the French plan to march on Vienna remained paralysed by uncertainty.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 89</ref>\n\nWith Villeroi shadowing Marlborough's every move, Marlborough's gamble that the French would not move against the weakened Dutch position in the Netherlands paid off.<ref name=chandler129>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 129</ref> In any case, Marlborough had promised to return to the Netherlands if a French attack developed there, transferring his troops down the Rhine on barges at a rate of {{convert|130|km|abbr=off}} a day.<ref name=chandler129/> Encouraged by this promise (whatever it was worth) the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] agreed to release the Danish contingent of seven battalions and 22 squadrons as a reinforcement.<ref name=chandler129/> Marlborough reached [[Ladenburg]], in the plain of the Neckar and the Rhine, and there halted for three days to rest his cavalry and allow the guns and infantry to close up.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 91</ref> On 6 June he arrived at [[Wiesloch]], south of [[Heidelberg]]. The following day, the Allied army swung away from the Rhine towards the hills of the [[Swabian Jura]] and the Danube beyond. At last Marlborough's destination was established without doubt.\n\n===Strategy===\n[[Image:Prinz Eugene of Savoy.PNG|thumb|180px|[[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] (1663\u20131736) by [[Jacob van Schuppen]]. Prince Eugene met Marlborough for the first time in 1704. It was the start of a lifelong personal and professional friendship.]]\n\nOn 10 June, the Duke met for the first time the President of the [[Imperial War Council]], Prince Eugene \u2013 accompanied by Count Wratislaw \u2013 at the village of [[Mundelsheim]], halfway between the Danube and the Rhine.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 23</ref> By 13 June, the Imperial Field Commander, Prince Louis of Baden, had joined them in [[Weinstadt|Gro\u00dfheppach]].<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 25. Eugene had doubts about Baden's reliability, for he was a close friend of the Elector of Bavaria. It was even suspected that Baden was secretly corresponding with his old comrade.</ref> The three generals commanded a force of nearly 110,000 men. At conference it was decided that Eugene would return with 28,000 men to the Lines of Stollhofen on the Rhine to keep an eye on Villeroi and Tallard and prevent them going to the aid of the Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Meanwhile, Marlborough's and Baden's forces would combine, totalling 80,000 men, for the march on the Danube to seek out the Elector and Marsin before they could be reinforced.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 132</ref>\n\nKnowing Marlborough's destination, Tallard and Villeroi met at [[Landau]] in the Palatinate on 13 June to rapidly construct a plan to save Bavaria but the rigidity of the French command system was such that any variations from the original plan had to be sanctioned by [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].<ref name=Chandler1>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 133</ref> The [[Jean-Philippe-Eug\u00e8ne de M\u00e9rode-Westerloo|Count of M\u00e9rode-Westerloo]], commander of the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] troops in Tallard's army wrote \u2013 \"One thing is certain: we delayed our march from Alsace for far too long and quite inexplicably.\"<ref name=Chandler1 /> Approval from [[King Louis XIV|Louis]] arrived on 27 June: Tallard was to reinforce Marsin and the Elector on the Danube via the Black Forest, with 40 battalions and 50 squadrons; Villeroi was to pin down the Allies defending the Lines of Stollhofen, or, if the Allies should move all their forces to the Danube, he was to join with Marshal Tallard; and General de Coignies with 8,000 men, would protect Alsace. On 1 July Tallard's army of 35,000 re-crossed the Rhine at [[Kehl]] and began its march.<ref name=Chandler1 />\n\nOn 22 June, Marlborough's forces linked up with Baden's Imperial forces at Launsheim. A distance of {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=off}} had been covered in five weeks.<ref>Lynn p. 287. Lynn states that the march-rate was not unprecedented for the period, averaging {{convert|7.5|mi|km|abbr=off}} per day. What stands out was the distance and the fine condition of the troops when they arrived.</ref> Thanks to a carefully planned time-table, the effects of wear and tear had been kept to a minimum. Captain Parker described the march discipline \u2013 \"As we marched through the country of our Allies, commissars were appointed to furnish us with all manner of necessaries for man and horse ... the soldiers had nothing to do but pitch their tents, boil kettles and lie down to rest.\"<ref name=chandler131>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 131. The Allied march had not been without loss: French spies reported that 900 sick had been left at [[Kassel]].</ref> In response to Marlborough's manoeuvres, the Elector and Marsin, conscious of their numerical disadvantage with only 40,000 men, moved their forces to the entrenched camp at [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]] on the north bank of the Danube. Marlborough could not attack Dillingen because of a lack of siege guns \u2013 he was unable to bring any from the Low Countries, and Baden had failed to supply any despite assurances to the contrary.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 26</ref>\n\n[[Image:Marlborough's assault on Schellenberg, 2 July 1704.gif|thumb|left|250px|Allied assault on the Schellenberg \u2013 taken by [[coup de main]] on 2 July \u2013 provided the Allies with an excellent river crossing.]]\nThe Allies, nevertheless, needed a base for provisions and a good river crossing. On 2 July, therefore, Marlborough at the [[Battle of Schellenberg]] stormed the fortress of Schellenberg on the heights above the town of [[Donauw\u00f6rth]]. [[Jean Baptist, Comte d'Arco|Count Jean d'Arco]] had been sent with 12,000 men from the Franco-Bavarian camp to hold the town and grassy hill but after a ferocious and bloody battle, inflicting enormous casualties on both sides, Schellenberg finally succumbed, forcing Donauw\u00f6rth to surrender shortly afterwards. The Elector, knowing his position at Dillingen was now not tenable, took up a position behind the strong fortifications of [[Augsburg]].<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 40</ref>\n\nTallard's march presented a dilemma for Eugene. If the Allies were not to be outnumbered on the Danube, Eugene realised he must either try to cut Tallard off before he could get there or he must hasten to reinforce Marlborough.<ref name=henderson103>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 103</ref> if he withdrew from the Rhine to the Danube, Villeroi might also make a move south to link up with the Elector and Marsin. Eugene compromised: leaving 12,000 troops behind guarding the Lines of Stollhofen, he marched off with the rest of his army to forestall Tallard.<ref name=henderson103/>\n\nLacking in numbers, Eugene could not seriously disrupt Tallard's march but the French Marshal's progress was proving pitifully slow. Tallard's force had suffered considerably more than Marlborough's troops on their march \u2013 many of his cavalry horses were suffering from [[glanders]] and the mountain passes were proving tough for the 2,000 wagons of provisions. Local German peasants, angry at French plundering, compounded Tallard's problems, leading M\u00e9rode-Westerloo to bemoan \u2013 \"the enraged peasantry killed several thousand of our men before the army was clear of the Black Forest.\"<ref name=chandler131/> Tallard had insisted on besieging the little town of [[Villingen]] for six days (16\u201322 July) but abandoned the enterprise on discovering the approach of Eugene.\n\nThe Elector in Augsburg was informed on 14 July that Tallard was on his way through the Black Forest. This good news bolstered the Elector's policy of inaction, further encouraging him to wait for the reinforcements.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 139</ref> But this reticence to fight induced Marlborough to undertake a controversial policy of spoliation in Bavaria, burning buildings and crops throughout the rich lands south of the Danube. This had two aims: firstly to put pressure on the Elector to fight or come to terms before Tallard arrived with reinforcements; and secondly, to ruin Bavaria as a base from which the French and Bavarian armies could attack Vienna, or pursue the Duke into [[Franconia]] if, at some stage, he had to withdraw northwards.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 41</ref> But this destruction, coupled with a protracted siege of [[Rain (Lech)|Rain]] (9\u201316 July), caused Prince Eugene to lament \"...&nbsp;since the Donauw\u00f6rth action I cannot admire their performances\", and later to conclude \"If he has to go home without having achieved his objective, he will certainly be ruined.\"<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 215</ref> Nevertheless, strategically the Duke had been able to place his numerically stronger forces between the Franco-Bavarian army and Vienna.\n\n===Final positioning===\n[[Image:Maneuvers before the Battle of Blenheim, 6-13 August 1704.gif|thumb|250px|[[Maneuver warfare|Manoeuvres]] before the battle 9\u201313 August.]]\n\nMarshal Tallard, with 34,000 men, reached Ulm, joining with the Elector and Marsin in Augsburg on 5 August (although Tallard was not impressed to find that the Elector had dispersed his army in response to Marlborough's campaign of ravaging the region).<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 44. Lynn states Tallard reached Augsburg on 3 August.</ref> Also on 5 August, Eugene reached [[H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt an der Donau|H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt]], riding that same night to meet with Marlborough at [[Schrobenhausen]]. Marlborough knew it was necessary that another crossing point over the Danube would be required in case Donauw\u00f6rth fell to the enemy. On 7 August, therefore, the first of Baden's 15,000 Imperial troops (the remainder following two days later) left Marlborough's main force to besiege the heavily defended city of [[Ingolstadt]], {{convert|32|km|abbr=off}} farther down the Danube.<ref>Holmes: ''Marlborough: England's Fragile Genius'' p. 279. Many reliable historians argue (as did M\u00e9rode-Westerloo at the time) that this was largely a device to get the 'cautious and obstructive Margrave out of the way'. However, Marlborough had assured Heinsius that the siege made perfect sense, and there is no direct evidence that they deliberately contrived his absence.</ref>\n\nWith Eugene's forces at H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt on the north bank of the Danube, and Marlborough's at Rain on the south bank, Tallard and the Elector debated their next move. Tallard preferred to bide his time, replenish supplies and allow Marlborough's Danube campaign to flounder in the colder weeks of Autumn; the Elector and Marsin, however, newly reinforced, were keen to push ahead. The French and Bavarian commanders eventually agreed on a plan and decided to attack Eugene's smaller force. On 9 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces began to cross to the north bank of the Danube.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 47</ref>\n\nOn 10 August, Eugene sent an urgent dispatch reporting that he was falling back to Donauw\u00f6rth \u2013 \"The enemy have marched. It is almost certain that the whole army is crossing the Danube at [[Lauingen]] ... The plain of Dillingen is crowded with troops ... Everything, milord, consists in speed and that you put yourself forthwith in movement to join me tomorrow, without which I fear it will be too late.\" By a series of brilliant marches Marlborough concentrated his forces on Donauw\u00f6rth and, by noon 11 August, the link-up was complete.<ref name=chandler141>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 141</ref>\n\nDuring 11 August, Tallard pushed forward from the river crossings at Dillingen; by 12 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces were encamped behind the small river Nebel near the village of Blenheim on the plain of H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt. That same day Marlborough and Eugene carried out their own reconnaissance of the French position from the church spire at [[Tapfheim]], and moved their combined forces to M\u00fcnster \u2013 {{convert|8|km|spell=in}} from the French camp. A French reconnaissance under the Marquis de Silly went forward to probe the enemy, but were driven off by Allied troops who had deployed to cover the pioneers of the advancing army, labouring to bridge the numerous streams in the area and improve the passage leading westwards to H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 842. The French had captured four prisoners. Under examination they declared that the whole Allied army was going to move off towards N\u00f6rdlingen the next morning.</ref> Marlborough quickly moved forward two brigades under the command of General Wilkes and Brigadier Rowe to secure the narrow strip of land between the Danube and the wooded Fuchsberg hill, at the [[Schwenningen, Bavaria|Schwenningen]] defile.<ref name=coxe188>Coxe: ''Memoirs of the Duke of Marlborough'': vol.i. p. 188</ref>\n\nTallard's army numbered 56,000 men and 90 guns; the army of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]], 52,000 men and 66 guns. Some Allied officers who were acquainted with the superior numbers of the enemy, and aware of their strong defensive position, ventured to remonstrate with Marlborough about the hazards of attacking; but the Duke was resolute \u2013 \"I know the danger, yet a battle is absolutely necessary, and I rely on the bravery and discipline of the troops, which will make amends for our disadvantages\".<ref name=coxe188/> Marlborough and Eugene decided to risk everything, and agreed to attack on the following day.\n\n==Battle==\n{{further information|Blenheim order of battle}}\n\n===The battlefield===\nThe battlefield stretched for nearly {{convert|6|km|0}}. The extreme right flank of the Franco-Bavarian army was covered by the Danube; to the extreme left flank lay the undulating pine-covered hills of the Swabian Jura. A small stream, the Nebel, (the ground either side of which was soft and marshy and only fordable intermittently), fronted the French line. The French right rested on the village of Blenheim near where the Nebel flows into the Danube; the village itself was surrounded by hedges, fences, enclosed gardens, and meadows. Between Blenheim and the next village of [[H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt an der Donau|Oberglauheim]] the fields of wheat had been cut to stubble and were now ideal to deploy troops. From Oberglauheim to the next hamlet of Lutzingen the terrain of ditches, thickets and brambles was potentially difficult ground for the attackers.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 106</ref>\n\n===Initial manoeuvres===\n[[Image:Battle of Blenhiem - Situation about noon, 13 August 1704.gif|thumb|250px|The position of the forces at noon, 13 August. Marlborough took control of the left arm of the Allied forces including the attacks on Blenheim and Oberglauheim, whilst Eugene commanded the right including the attacks on [[Lutzingen]].]]\n\nAt 02:00 on 13 August 40 squadrons were sent forward towards the enemy, followed at 03:00, in eight columns, by the main Allied force pushing over the Kessel. At about 06:00 they reached Schwenningen, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} from Blenheim. The English and German troops who had held Schwenningen through the night joined the march, making a ninth column on the left of the army. Marlborough and Eugene made their final plans. The Allied commanders agreed that Marlborough would command 36,000 troops and attack Tallard's force of 33,000 on the left (including capturing the village of Blenheim), whilst Eugene, commanding 16,000 men would attack the Elector and Marsin's combined forces of 23,000 troops on the right wing; if this attack was pressed hard the Elector and Marsin would have no troops to send to aid Tallard on their right.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 57</ref> [[John Cutts, 1st Baron Cutts|Lieutenant-General John Cutts]] would attack Blenheim in concert with Eugene's attack. With the French flanks busy, Marlborough could cross the Nebel and deliver the fatal blow to the French at their centre. However, Marlborough would have to wait until Eugene was in position before the general engagement could begin.\n\nThe last thing Tallard expected that morning was to be attacked by the Allies \u2013 deceived by intelligence gathered from prisoners taken by de Silly the previous day, and assured in their strong natural position, Tallard and his colleagues were convinced that Marlborough and Eugene were about to retreat north-eastwards towards [[N\u00f6rdlingen]].<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 108. Several sources (Churchill, Chandler) suggest that Marlborough had planted this corroborative 'evidence' on Tallard.</ref> Tallard wrote a report to this effect to King Louis that morning, but hardly had he sent the messenger when the Allied army began to appear opposite his camp.  \"I could see the enemy advancing ever closer in nine great columns\", wrote M\u00e9rode-Westerloo, \" ... filling the whole plain from the Danube to the woods on the horizon.\"<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 109</ref> Signal guns were fired to bring in the foraging parties and [[picket (military) | pickets]] as the French and Bavarian troops tried to draw into battle-order to face the unexpected threat.\n\nAt about 08:00 the French artillery on their right wing opened fire, answered by [[Holcroft Blood|Colonel Blood]]'s batteries.<ref>Churchill states 08:30</ref> The guns were heard by Baden in his camp before Ingolstadt, \"The Prince and the Duke are engaged today to the westward\", he wrote to the Emperor. \"Heaven bless them.\"<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 848</ref> An hour later Tallard, the Elector, and Marsin climbed Blenheim's church tower to finalise their plans. It was settled that the Elector and Marsin would hold the front from the hills to Oberglauheim, whilst Tallard would defend the ground between Oberglauheim and the Danube. The French commanders were, however, divided as to how to utilise the Nebel: Tallard's tactic \u2013 opposed by Marsin and the Elector who felt it better to close their infantry right up to the stream itself \u2013 was to lure the allies across before unleashing their cavalry upon them, causing panic and confusion; whilst the enemy was struggling in the marshes, they would be caught in crossfire from Blenheim and Oberglauheim. The plan was sound if all its parts were implemented, but it allowed Marlborough to cross the Nebel without serious interference and fight the battle he had in mind.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 58</ref>\n\n===Deployment===\n[[File:The Battle of Hoechstaedt.jpg|thumb|250px|The Battle of Blenheim by [[Huchtenburg]]]]\nThe Franco-Bavarian commanders deployed their forces. In the village of Lutzingen, Count Maffei positioned five Bavarian battalions with a great battery of 16 guns at the village's edge. In the woods to the left of Lutzingen, seven French battalions under the Marquis de Rozel moved into place. Between Lutzingen and Oberglauheim the Elector placed 27 squadrons of cavalry \u2013 Count d'Arco commanded 14 Bavarian squadrons and Count Wolframsdorf had 13 more in support nearby. To their right stood Marsin's 40 French squadrons and 12 battalions. The village of Oberglauheim was packed with 14 battalions commanded by the Marquis de Blainville (including the effective Irish Brigade known as the '[[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]]'). Six batteries of guns were ranged alongside the village.<ref name=falkner61>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 61</ref> On the right of these French and Bavarian positions, between Oberglauheim and Blenheim, Tallard deployed 64 French and Walloon squadrons (16 drawn from Marsin) supported by nine French battalions standing near the H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt road. In the cornfield next to Blenheim stood three battalions from the Regiment de Roi. Nine battalions occupied the village itself, commanded by the Marquis de Cl\u00e9rambault. Four battalions stood to the rear and a further 11 were in reserve. These battalions were supported by Hautefeuille's 12 squadrons of dismounted dragoons.<ref name=falkner61 /> By 11:00 Tallard, the Elector, and Marsin were in place. Many of the Allied generals were hesitant to attack such a relatively strong position. The [[George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Earl of Orkney]] later confessed that, \"had I been asked to give my opinion, I had been against it.\"<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 62</ref>\n\nPrince Eugene was expected to be in position by 11:00, but due to the difficult terrain and enemy fire, progress was slow.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 63</ref> Lord Cutts' column \u2013 who by 10:00 had expelled the enemy from two water mills upon the Nebel \u2013 had already deployed by the river against Blenheim, enduring over the next three hours severe fire from a heavy six-gun battery posted near the village. The rest of Marlborough's army, waiting in their ranks on the forward slope, were also forced to bear the cannonade from the French artillery, suffering 2,000 casualties before the attack could even start.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 852</ref> Meanwhile, engineers repaired a stone bridge across the Nebel, and constructed five additional bridges or causeways across the marsh between Blenheim and Oberglauheim. Marlborough's anxiety was finally allayed when, just past noon, [[William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan|Colonel Cadogan]] reported that Eugene's [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] and [[Denmark|Danish]] infantry were in place \u2013 the order for the general advance was given. At 13:00, Cutts was ordered to attack the village of Blenheim whilst Prince Eugene was requested to assault Lutzingen on the Allied right flank.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 66</ref>\n\n===Blenheim===\n[[Image:Battle of Blenheim Tapestry.jpg|thumb|250px|Part of the Battle of Blenheim tapestry at [[Blenheim Palace]] by [[Judocus de Vos]].

The foreground shows an English grenadier with a captured French colour.]]\n\nCutts ordered Brigadier-General Archibald Rowe's brigade to attack. The English infantry rose from the edge of the Nebel, and silently marched towards Blenheim, a distance of some {{convert|150|m|yd|-1}}. John Ferguson's Scottish brigade supported Rowe's left, and moved in perfect order towards the barricades between the village and the river, defended by Hautefeuille's dragoons. As the range closed to within {{convert|30|m|yd|-1}}, the French fired a deadly volley. Rowe had ordered that there should be no firing from his men until he struck his sword upon the [[palisade]]s, but as he stepped forward to give the signal, he fell mortally wounded.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 853. Two of Rowe's staff officers were killed trying to carry him away: Lieutenant-Colonel Dalyell and Major Campbell.</ref> The survivors of the leading companies closed up the gaps in their torn ranks and rushed forward. Small parties penetrated the defences, but repeated French volleys forced the English back towards the Nebel, sustaining heavy casualties. As the attack faltered, eight squadrons of elite Gens d'Armes, commanded by the veteran Swiss officer, Beat-Jacques von Zurlauben, fell upon the English troops, cutting at the exposed flank of [[Royal Scots Fusiliers|Rowe's own regiment]].<ref>Churchill and Coxe states only three squadrons of Gens d'Armes. Rowe's own regiment lost their colours, but they were soon retrieved by the Hessians.</ref> However, Wilkes' [[Hesse|Hessian]] brigade, lying nearby in the marshy grass at the water's edge, stood firm and repulsed the Gens d'Armes with steady fire, enabling the English and Hessians to re-order and launch another attack.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 68</ref>\n\nAlthough the Allies were again repulsed, these persistent attacks on Blenheim eventually bore fruit, panicking Cl\u00e9rambault into making the worst French error of the day.<ref name=chandler145>Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe'', p. 145</ref> Without consulting Tallard, Cl\u00e9rambault ordered his reserve battalions into the village, upsetting the balance of the French position and nullifying the French numerical superiority. \"The men were so crowded in upon one another\", wrote M\u00e9rode-Westerloo, \"that they couldn't even fire \u2013 let alone receive or carry out any orders.\"<ref name=chandler145/> Marlborough, spotting this error, now countermanded Cutts' intention to launch a third attack, and ordered him simply to contain the enemy within Blenheim; no more than 5,000 Allied soldiers were able to pen in twice the number of French infantry and dragoons.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 70</ref>\n\n===Lutzingen===\n:'' ... Prince Eugene and the Imperial troops had been repulsed three times \u2013 driven right back to the woods \u2013 and had taken a real drubbing.'' \u2013 M\u00e9rode-Westerloo.<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 270</ref>\n[[Image:Spanischer Erbfolgekrieg 1704, Lutzingen, Germany.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Memorial for the Battle of Blenheim 1704, [[Lutzingen]], Germany.]]\n\nOn the Allied right, Eugene's Prussian and Danish forces were desperately fighting the numerically superior forces of the Elector and Marsin. The [[Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Prince of Anhalt-Dessau]] led forward four brigades across the Nebel to assault the well-fortified position of Lutzingen. Here, the Nebel was less of an obstacle, but the great battery positioned on the edge of the village enjoyed a good field of fire across the open ground stretching to the hamlet of Schwennenbach. As soon as the infantry crossed the stream, they were struck by Maffei's infantry, and salvoes from the Bavarian guns positioned both in front of the village and in [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] on the wood-line to the right. Despite heavy casualties the Prussians attempted to storm the great battery, whilst the Danes, under Count Scholten, attempted to drive the French infantry out of the copses beyond the village.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 71</ref>\n\nWith the infantry heavily engaged, Eugene's cavalry picked its way across the Nebel. After an initial success, his first line of cavalry, under the Imperial General of Horse, [[Maximilian Wilhelm of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Prince Maximilian of Hanover]], were pressed by the second line of Marsin's cavalry, and were forced back across the Nebel in confusion. Nevertheless, the exhausted French were unable to follow up their advantage, and the two cavalry forces tried to regroup and reorder their ranks.<ref>Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 67</ref> However, without cavalry support, and threatened with envelopment, the Prussian and Danish infantry were in turn forced to pull back across the Nebel. Panic gripped some of Eugene's troops as they crossed the stream. Ten infantry colours were lost to the Bavarians, and hundreds of prisoners taken; it was only through the leadership of Eugene and the Prussian Prince that the imperial infantry were prevented from abandoning the field.<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 268</ref>\n\nAfter rallying his troops near Schwennenbach \u2013 well beyond their starting point \u2013 Eugene prepared to launch a second attack, led by the second-line squadrons under the [[Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg-Teck]]. Yet again they were caught in the murderous cross-fire from the artillery in Lutzingen and Oberglauheim, and were once again thrown back in disarray. The French and Bavarians, however, were almost as disordered as their opponents, and they too were in need of inspiration from their commander, the Elector, who was seen \" ... riding up and down, and inspiring his men with fresh courage.\"<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 73</ref> Anhalt-Dessau's Danish and Prussian infantry attacked a second time but could not sustain the advance without proper support. Once again they fell back across the stream.\n\n===Centre and Oberglauheim===\n[[File:Battle of Blenheim - Joshua Ross jr.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Blenheim by Joshua Ross]]\n:'' ... they began to pass [the marshes and the Nebel] as fast as the badness of the ground would permit them.'' \u2013  Churchill's chaplain.<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 258</ref>\n\nWhilst these events around Blenheim and Lutzingen were taking place, Marlborough was preparing to cross the Nebel. The centre, commanded by the Duke's brother, General Charles Churchill, consisted of 18 battalions of infantry arranged in two lines: seven battalions in the front line to secure a foothold across the Nebel, and 11 battalions in the rear providing cover from the Allied side of the stream. Between the infantry were placed two lines, 72 squadrons of cavalry. The first line of foot was to pass the stream first and march as far to the other side as could be conveniently done. This line would then form and cover the passage of the horse, leaving gaps in the line of infantry large enough for the cavalry to pass through and take their position in front.\n\n[[File:Camille d'Hostun duc de Tallard.png|thumb|180px|left|[[Camille d'Hostun, duc de Tallard|Marshal Tallard]] (1652\u20131728). He has been criticised for allowing Cl\u00e9rambault to maintain a force of infantry in Blenheim so large that it denied the main army manpower it needed.]]\n\nMarlborough ordered the formation forward. Once again Zurlauben's Gens d'Armes charged, looking to rout [[Henry Lumley|Lumley]]'s English cavalry who linked Cutts' column facing Blenheim with Churchill's infantry. As these elite French cavalry attacked, they were faced by five English squadrons under Colonel Francis Palmes. To the consternation of the French, the Gens d'Armes were pushed back in terrible confusion, pursued well beyond the Maulweyer stream that flows through Blenheim.<ref name =falkner76>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 76. In his account after the battle, Tallard explains his defeat \u2013 \"first, because the Gendarmerie were not able to break the five English squadrons.\"</ref> \"What? Is it possible?\" exclaimed the Elector, \"the gentlemen of France fleeing?\"<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 856</ref> Palmes, however, attempted to follow up his success but was repulsed in some confusion by other French cavalry, and musket fire from the edge of Blenheim.<ref name=falkner76/>\n\nNevertheless, Tallard was alarmed by the repulse of the elite Gens d'Armes and urgently rode across the field to ask Marsin for reinforcements; but on the basis of being hard pressed by Eugene \u2013 whose second attack was in full flood \u2013 Marsin refused.<ref name=falkner77>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 77</ref> As Tallard consulted with Marsin, more of his infantry was being taken into Blenheim by Cl\u00e9rambault. Fatally, Tallard, aware of the situation, did nothing to rectify this grave mistake, leaving him with just the nine battalions of infantry near the H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt road\nto oppose the massed enemy ranks in the centre.<ref name=falkner77/> Zurlauben tried several more times to disrupt the Allies forming on Tallard's side of the stream; his front-line cavalry darting forward down the gentle slope towards the Nebel. But the attacks lacked co-ordination, and the Allied infantry's steady volleys disconcerted the French horsemen.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 78</ref> During these skirmishes Zurlauben fell mortally wounded, and died two days later. The time was just after 15:00.\n\nThe Danish cavalry, under the [[Carl Rudolf, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt|Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt]] (not to be confused with the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg who fought with Eugene), had made slow work of crossing the Nebel near Oberglau; harassed by Marsin's infantry near the village, the Danes were driven back across the stream. Count Horn's Dutch infantry managed to push the French back from the water's edge, but it was apparent that before Marlborough could launch his main effort against Tallard, Oberglauheim would have to be secured.\n[[File:Allied attack on Oberglau.png|thumb|250px|Allied attack on [[H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt an der Donau|Oberglauheim]].]]\nCount Horn directed the [[Anton G\u00fcnther, Prince of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck|Prince of Holstein-Beck]] to take the village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and badly wounding the Prince during the action.<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 264</ref> The battle was now in the balance. If Holstein-Beck's Dutch column were destroyed, the Allied army would be split in two: Eugene's wing would be isolated from Marlborough's, passing the initiative to the Franco-Bavarian forces now engaged across the whole plain.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 80. Tallard later recorded \u2013 \"At this moment I saw the hope of victory.\"</ref> Seeing the opportunity, Marsin ordered his cavalry to change from facing Eugene, and turn towards their right and the open flank of Churchill's infantry drawn up in front of Unterglau. Marlborough (who had crossed the Nebel on a makeshift bridge to take personal control), ordered Hulsen's Hanoverian battalions to support the Dutch infantry. A Dutch cavalry brigade under Averock was also called forward but soon came under pressure from Marsin's more numerous squadrons.\n\nMarlborough now requested Eugene to release Count Hendrick Fugger and his Imperial Cuirassier brigade to help repel the French cavalry thrust. Despite his own desperate struggle, the Imperial Prince at once complied, demonstrating the high degree of confidence and mutual co-operation between the two generals.<ref>Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe'', p. 161</ref> Although the Nebel stream lay between Fugger's and Marsin's squadrons, the French were forced to change front to meet this new threat, thus forestalling the chance for Marsin to strike at Marlborough's infantry.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 81</ref> Fugger's [[cuirassiers]] charged and, striking at a favourable angle, threw back Marsin's squadrons in disorder.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 858</ref> With support from Colonel Blood's batteries, the Hessian, Hanoverian and Dutch infantry \u2013 now commanded by Count Berensdorf \u2013 succeeded in pushing the French and Irish infantry back into Oberglauheim so that they could not again threaten Churchill's flank as he moved against Tallard. The French commander in the village, the Marquis de Blainville, numbered amongst the heavy casualties.<ref name=falkner82>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 82</ref>\n\n===Breakthrough===\n:''The [French] foot remained in the best order I ever saw, till they were cut to pieces almost in rank and file.'' \u2013 [[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Lord Orkney]].<ref name=falkner86>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 86</ref>\n[[Image:Battle of Blenheim - Penetration, 1730, 13 August 1704.gif|thumb|250px|Breakthrough: Position of the battle at 17:30.]]\n\nBy 16:00, with the Franco-Bavarian troops besieged in Blenheim and Oberglau, the Allied centre of 81 squadrons (nine squadrons had been transferred from Cutts' column), supported by 18 battalions was firmly planted amidst the French line of 64 squadrons and nine battalions of raw recruits. There was now a pause in the battle: Marlborough wanted to concert the attack upon the whole front, and Eugene, after his second repulse, needed time to reorganise.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 860</ref>\n\nJust after 17:00 all was ready along the Allied front. Marlborough's two lines of cavalry had now moved to the front of the Duke's line of battle, with the two supporting lines of infantry behind them. [[Jean-Philippe-Eug\u00e8ne de M\u00e9rode-Westerloo|M\u00e9rode-Westerloo]] attempted to extricate some French infantry crowded in Blenheim, but Cl\u00e9rambault ordered the troops back into the village. The French cavalry exerted themselves once more against the first line \u2013 Lumley's English and Scots on the Allied left, and Hompesch's Dutch and German squadrons on the Allied right. Tallard's squadrons, lacking infantry support, were tired and ragged but managed to push the Allied first line back to their infantry support. With the battle still not won, Marlborough had to rebuke one of his cavalry officers who was attempting to leave the field \u2013 \"Sir, you are under a mistake, the enemy lies that way ...\"<ref name=falkner86 /> Now, at the Duke's command, the second Allied line under Cuno Josua von B\u00fclow and Bothmer was ordered forward, and, driving through the centre, the Allies finally put Tallard's tired horse to rout, though not without cost. The Prussian Life Dragoons' Colonel, Ludwig [[von Blumenthal]], and his 2nd in command, Lt. Col. [[von Hacke]], fell next to each other. But the charge succeeded and with their cavalry in headlong flight, the remaining nine French infantry battalions fought with desperate valour, trying to form square.<ref name=falkner86 /> But it was futile. The French battalions were overwhelmed by Colonel Blood's close-range artillery and platoon fire. M\u00e9rode-Westerloo later wrote \u2013 \"[They] died to a man where they stood, stationed right out in the open plain \u2013 supported by nobody.\"<ref name=falkner86 />\n\nThe majority of Tallard's retreating troops headed for H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt but most did not make the safety of the town, plunging instead into the Danube where upwards of 3,000 French horsemen drowned;<ref>Churchill states up to 2,000</ref> others were cut down by the pursuing cavalry. The Marquis de Gruignan attempted a counter-attack, but he was easily brushed aside by the triumphant Allies. After a final rally behind his camp's tents, shouting entreaties to stand and fight, Marshal Tallard was caught up in the rout and pushed towards Sonderheim.<ref name=falkner90>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 90</ref> Surrounded by a squadron of [[Hesse|Hessian]] troops, Tallard surrendered to Lieutenant-Colonel de Boinenburg, the [[Frederick I of Sweden|Prince of Hesse-Kassel]]'s ''[[aide-de-camp]]'', and was sent under escort to Marlborough.<ref>Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 85</ref> The Duke welcomed the French commander \u2013 \"I am very sorry that such a cruel misfortune should have fallen upon a soldier for whom I have the highest regard.\" With salutes and courtesies, the Marshal was escorted to Marlborough's coach.<ref name=falkner90/>\n\n===Fall of Blenheim===\n[[File:Battle of Blenheim (1704)@01.JPG|thumb|250px|The Battle of Blenheim by [[John Wootton]]]]\n:'' ... our men fought in and through the fire ... until many on both sides were burned to death.'' \u2013 Private Deane, [[Grenadier Guards|1st Regiment Foot Guards]].<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 294</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Allies had once again attacked the Bavarian stronghold at Lutzingen.\nEugene, however, became exasperated with the performance of his Imperial cavalry whose third attack had failed: he had already shot two of his troopers to prevent a general flight. Then, declaring in disgust that he wished to \"fight among brave men and not among cowards\", Eugene went into the attack with the Prussian and Danish infantry, as did the Dessauer, waving a regimental colour to inspire his troops.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 86</ref> This time the Prussians were able to storm the great Bavarian battery, and overwhelm the guns' crews.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 91</ref> Beyond the village, Scholten's Danes defeated the French infantry in a desperate hand-to-hand bayonet struggle.<ref>Danish infantry suffered 2,401 casualties fighting for possession of the woods beyond Lutzingen (Falkner)</ref> When they saw that the centre had broken, the Elector and Marsin decided the battle was lost and, like the remnants of Tallard's army, fled the battlefield (albeit in better order than Tallard's men). Attempts to organise an Allied force to prevent Marsin's withdrawal failed owing to the exhaustion of the cavalry, and the growing confusion in the field.\n\n[[Image:Battle of Blenhiem - Explotation, 13 August 1704.gif|left|thumb|250px|Pursuit]]\nMarlborough now had to turn his attention from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, in and around the walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvi\u00e8re. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack. The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 95</ref>\n\nMany of the cottages were now burning, obscuring the field of fire and driving the defenders out of their positions. Hearing the din of battle in Blenheim, Tallard sent a message to Marlborough offering to order the garrison to withdraw from the field.\n\"Inform Monsieur Tallard\", replied the Duke, \"that, in the position in which he is now, he has no command.\"<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 865</ref> Nevertheless, as dusk came the Allied commander was anxious for a quick conclusion. The French infantry fought tenaciously to hold on to their position in Blenheim, but their commander was nowhere to be found. Cl\u00e9rambault's insistence on confining his huge force in the village was to seal his fate that day.<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 291</ref> Realising his tactical mistake had contributed to Tallard's defeat in the centre, Cl\u00e9rambault deserted Blenheim and the 27 battalions defending the village, and reportedly drowned in the Danube while attempting to make his escape.\n\n[[Image:Battle of Blenheim Diorama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Diorama]] of the battle in the H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt museum. In the middle ground the Allied cavalry are breaking through, pushing Tallard's squadrons from the battlefield. The foreground depicts the fierce fighting in and around Blenheim.]]\n\nBy now Blenheim was under assault from every side by three British generals: Cutts, Churchill, and Orkney. The French had repulsed every attack with heavy slaughter, but many had seen what had happened on the plain and what its consequences to them would be; their army was routed and they were cut off.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 867</ref> Orkney, attacking from the rear, now tried a different tactic \u2013 \"...&nbsp;it came into my head to beat parley\", he later wrote, \"which they accepted of and immediately their Brigadier de Nouville capitulated with me to be prisoner at discretion and lay down their arms.\" Threatened by Allied guns, other units followed their example. However, it was not until 21:00 that the Marquis de Blanzac, who had taken charge in Cl\u00e9rambault's absence, reluctantly accepted the inevitability of defeat, and some 10,000 of France's best infantry had laid down their arms.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 98</ref>\n\nDuring these events Marlborough was still in the saddle conducting the pursuit of the broken enemy. Pausing for a moment he scribbled on the back of an old tavern bill a note addressed to his wife, [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah]]: \"I have no time to say more but to beg you will give my duty to the Queen, and let her know her army has had a glorious victory.\"<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 121. The message was carried to London by Colonel Daniel Parke.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Pieter van Bloemen - The Duke of Marlborough and the Earl of Cadogan at Blenheim (Hochstadt).jpg|thumb|250px|Marlborough and Cadogan at the Battle of Blenheim by [[Pieter van Bloemen]]]]\n[[File:Joannes-Antonius-Florantin-Dic\u00e6omachia-sive-Erotemata MG 0920.tif|thumb|250px|Battle of H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt by Wolfgang and Vind.]]\n\nFrench losses were immense, with over 27,000 killed, wounded and captured.{{sfn|Clodfelter|2017|p=185}}<ref name=barnett122>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 122</ref> Moreover, the myth of French invincibility had been destroyed and Louis's hopes of an early and victorious peace had been wrenched from his grasp.<ref name=barnett122/> M\u00e9rode-Westerloo summarised the case against Tallard's army: \"The French lost this battle for a wide variety of reasons. For one thing they had too good an opinion of their own ability ... Another point was their faulty field dispositions, and in addition there was rampant indiscipline and inexperience displayed ... It took all these faults to lose so celebrated a battle.\"<ref name=Chandler149>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 149</ref> It was a hard-fought contest, leading Prince Eugene to observe \u2013 \"I have not a squadron or battalion which did not charge four times at least.\"<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 103</ref> Although the war dragged on for years, the Battle of Blenheim was probably its most decisive victory; Marlborough and Eugene, working indivisibly together, had saved the Habsburg Empire and thereby preserved the Grand Alliance from collapse.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 88</ref> [[Munich]], Augsburg, Ingolstadt, Ulm and all remaining territory of Bavaria soon fell to the Allies. By the [[Treaty of Ilbersheim]], signed 7 November 1704, Bavaria was placed under Austrian military rule, allowing the Habsburgs to use its resources for the rest of the conflict.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714'', p. 293</ref>\n\nThe remnants of the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria's]] and Marshal Marsin's wing limped back to Strasbourg, losing another 7,000 men through desertion.<ref name=Chandler149/> Despite being offered the chance to remain as ruler of Bavaria (under strict terms of an alliance with Austria), the Elector left his country and family in order to continue the war against the Allies from the Spanish Netherlands where he still held the post of governor-general. Their commander-in-chief that day, Marshal Tallard  \u2013 who, unlike his subordinates, had not been ransomed or exchanged \u2013 was taken to England and imprisoned in [[Nottingham]] until his release in 1711.<ref name=Tincey1>Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 88</ref>\n\nThe 1704 campaign lasted considerably longer than usual as the Allies sought to wring out maximum advantage. Realising that France was too powerful to be forced to make peace by a single victory, however, Eugene, Marlborough and Baden met to plan their next moves. For the following year the Duke proposed a campaign along the valley of the River Moselle to carry the war deep into France. This required the capture of the major fortress of Landau which guarded the Rhine, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle itself.<ref name=Tincey1/> Trier was taken on 27 October and Landau fell on 23 November to the Margrave of Baden and Prince Eugene; with the fall of Trarbach on 20 December, the campaign season for 1704 came to an end.\n\nMarlborough returned to England on 14 December ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S]]) to the acclamation of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and the country. In the first days of January the 110 cavalry standards and the 128 infantry colours that were taken during the battle were borne in procession to [[Westminster Hall]].<ref>Churchill states 171 standards and 129 colours.</ref> In February 1705, Queen Anne, who had made Marlborough a Duke in 1702, granted him the [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Park of Woodstock]] and promised a sum of \u00a3240,000 to build [[Blenheim Palace|a suitable house]] as a gift from a grateful crown in recognition of his victory \u2013 a victory which British historian Sir [[Edward Shepherd Creasy]] considered one of the pivotal battles in history, writing \u2013 \"Had it not been for Blenheim, all Europe might at this day suffer under the effect of French conquests resembling those of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in extent and those of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in durability.\"<ref>Edward Shepherd Creasy, [[The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World]], 1851</ref> However, military historian [[John A. Lynn]] consider this claim unjustified as Louis XIV never laboured such objective, as the campaign in Bavaria was intended to bring only a favourable peace settlement and not domination over Europe.{{sfn|Lynn|2013|p=294}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* [[Correlli Barnett|Barnett, Correlli]].

For the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] \u2013 Austria, England, and the Dutch Republic \u2013 the battle had followed an indecisive campaign against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] armies of King [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1705. Although the Allies had [[Siege of Barcelona (1705)|captured Barcelona]] that year, they had been forced to abandon their campaign on the [[Moselle River|Moselle]], had stalled in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and suffered defeat in northern Italy. Yet despite his opponents' setbacks Louis XIV wanted peace, but on reasonable terms. Because of this, as well as to maintain their momentum, the French and their allies took the offensive in 1706.\n\nThe campaign began well for Louis XIV's generals: in Italy Marshal [[Louis Joseph, Duke of Vend\u00f4me|Vend\u00f4me]] defeated the Austrians at the [[Battle of Calcinato]] in April, while in [[Alsace]] Marshal [[Claude Louis Hector de Villars|Villars]] forced the [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Margrave of Baden]] back across the [[Rhine]]. Encouraged by these early gains Louis XIV urged Marshal [[Fran\u00e7ois de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Villeroi]] to go over to the offensive in the Spanish Netherlands and, with victory, gain a 'fair' peace. Accordingly, the French Marshal set off from [[Leuven]] (''Louvain'') at the head of 60,000 men and marched towards [[Tienen]] (''Tirlemont''), as if to threaten [[Zoutleeuw]] (''L\u00e9au''). Also determined to fight a major engagement, the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], commander-in-chief of Anglo-Dutch forces, assembled his army \u2013 some 62,000 men \u2013 near [[Maastricht]], and marched past Zoutleeuw. With both sides seeking battle, they soon encountered each other on the dry ground between the [[Mehaigne]] and Petite Gheete rivers, close to the small village of [[Ramillies, Belgium|Ramillies]].\n\nIn less than four hours Marlborough's [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]], [[Kingdom of England|English]], and [[Denmark-Norway|Danish]] forces<ref>Denmark never joined the Grand Alliance, but Danish troops, hired by the Maritime Powers (England and the Dutch Republic), were central to Allied success at both the [[Battle of Blenheim]] in 1704 and Ramillies, 1706.</ref> overwhelmed Villeroi's and [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Max Emanuel]]'s Franco-Spanish-Bavarian army. The Duke's subtle moves and changes in emphasis during the battle \u2013 something his opponents failed to realise until it was too late \u2013 caught the French in a tactical <!-- VICE/VISE spelling: please note that this article is using British spelling and Vice is therefore the correct spelling -->vice. With their foe broken and routed, the Allies were able to fully exploit their victory. Town after town fell, including [[Brussels]], [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]]; by the end of the campaign Villeroi's army had been driven from most of the Spanish Netherlands. With Prince [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Eugene]]'s subsequent success at the [[Battle of Turin]] in northern Italy, the Allies had imposed the greatest loss of territory and resources that Louis XIV would suffer during the war. Thus, the year 1706 proved, for the Allies, to be an ''[[annus mirabilis]]''.\n\n==Background==\nAfter their disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] in 1704, the next year brought the French some respite. The [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] had intended the 1705 campaign \u2013 an invasion of France through the [[Moselle River|Moselle]] valley \u2013 to complete the work of Blenheim and persuade King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to make peace but the plan had been thwarted by friend and foe alike.<ref name=barnett140>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 140</ref> The reluctance of his Dutch allies to see their frontiers denuded of troops for another gamble in Germany had denied Marlborough the initiative<ref name=barnett140/> but of far greater importance was the [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Margrave of Baden]]\u2019s pronouncement that he could not join the Duke in strength for the coming offensive. This was in part due to the sudden switching of troops from the Rhine to reinforce [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Prince Eugene]] in Italy and part due to the deterioration of Baden\u2019s health brought on by the re-opening of a severe foot wound he had received at the [[Battle of Schellenberg|storming of the Schellenberg]] the previous year.<ref name=chandler154>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 154</ref> Marlborough had to cope with the death of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] in May and the accession of [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], which unavoidably complicated matters for the Grand Alliance.<ref name=chandler154/>\n\nThe resilience of the French King and the efforts of his generals, also added to Marlborough\u2019s problems.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 18</ref> Marshal [[Fran\u00e7ois de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Villeroi]], exerting considerable pressure on the Dutch commander, Count [[Henry de Nassau, Lord Overkirk|Overkirk]], along the [[Meuse River|Meuse]], took [[Huy]] on 10 June before pressing on towards [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]]. With Marshal Villars sitting strong on the [[Moselle]], the Allied commander \u2013 whose supplies had by now become very short \u2013 was forced to call off his campaign on 16 June. \"What a disgrace for Marlborough,\" exulted Villeroi, \"to have made false movements without any result!\"<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 157</ref> With Marlborough's departure north, the French transferred troops from the Moselle valley to reinforce Villeroi in Flanders, while Villars marched off to the Rhine.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714,'' 298</ref>\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch forces gained minor compensation for the failed Moselle campaign with the success at [[Battle of Elixheim|Elixheim]] and the crossing of the [[Lines of Brabant]] in the Spanish Netherlands (Huy was also retaken on 11 July) but a chance to bring the French to a decisive engagement eluded Marlborough.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough,''  152</ref> The year 1705 proved almost entirely barren for the Duke, whose military disappointments were only partly compensated by efforts on the diplomatic front where, at the courts of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Vienna]], [[Berlin]] and [[Hanover]], Marlborough sought to bolster support for the Grand Alliance and extract promises of prompt assistance for the following year's campaign.<ref>\nChandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 164\n</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nOn 11 January 1706, Marlborough finally reached [[London]] at the end of his diplomatic tour but he had already been planning his strategy for the coming season. The first option (although it is debatable to what extent the Duke was committed to such an enterprise) was a plan to transfer his forces from the Spanish Netherlands to northern Italy; once there, he intended linking up with Prince Eugene in order to defeat the French and safeguard [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]] from being overrun.<ref name=barnett58>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 158</ref> Savoy would then serve as a gateway into France by way of the mountain passes or an invasion with naval support along the Mediterranean coast via [[Nice]] and [[Toulon]], in connexion with redoubled Allied efforts in Spain.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 102.</ref> It seems that the Duke's favoured scheme was to return to the Moselle valley (where Marshal [[Ferdinand de Marsin|Marsin]] had recently taken command of French forces) and once more attempt an advance into the heart of France.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 169</ref> But these decisions soon became academic. Shortly after Marlborough landed in the Dutch Republic on 14 April, news arrived of big Allied setbacks in the wider war.\n\nDetermined to show the Grand Alliance that France was still resolute, Louis XIV prepared to launch a double surprise in [[Alsace]] and northern Italy.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 159</ref> On the latter front Marshal [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vend\u00f4me|Vend\u00f4me]] defeated the Imperial army at [[Battle of Calcinato|Calcinato]] on 19 April, pushing the Imperialists back in confusion (French forces were now in a position to prepare for the long-anticipated siege of [[Turin]]). In Alsace, Marshal Villars took Baden by surprise and captured [[Haguenau]], driving him back across the Rhine in some disorder, thus creating a threat on [[Landau]].<ref name=chandler168>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 168</ref> With these reverses, the Dutch refused to contemplate Marlborough's ambitious march to Italy or any plan that denuded their borders of the Duke and their army.<ref name=falkner33>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 33</ref> In the interest of coalition harmony, Marlborough prepared to campaign in the Low Countries.<ref name=falkner33/>\n\n===On the move===\n[[File:Low Countries 1700.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Low Countries during the War of the Spanish Succession. The village of Ramillies lies near the Mehaigne, a tributary of the Meuse]]\nThe Duke left [[The Hague]] on 9 May. \"God knows I go with a heavy heart,\" he wrote six days later to his friend and political ally in England, Lord [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]], \"for I have no hope of doing anything considerable, unless the French do what I am very confident they will not \u2026 \" \u2013 in other words, court battle.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 160</ref> On 17 May the Duke concentrated his Dutch and English troops at [[Tongeren]], near [[Maastricht]]. The Hanoverians, Hessians and Danes, despite earlier undertakings, found, or invented, pressing reasons for withholding their support.<ref name=chandler168/> Marlborough wrote an appeal to the [[Carl Rudolf, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt|Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], the commander of the Danish contingent \u2013 \"I send you this express to request your Highness to bring forward by a double march your cavalry so as to join us at the earliest moment \u2026\"<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 38</ref> Additionally, the King ''in'' Prussia, [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], had kept his troops in quarters behind the Rhine while his personal disputes with Vienna and the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] at The Hague remained unresolved. Nevertheless, the Duke could think of no circumstances why the French would leave their strong positions and attack his army, even if Villeroi was first reinforced by substantial transfers from Marsin's command.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 170</ref> But in this he had miscalculated. Although Louis XIV wanted peace he wanted it on reasonable terms; for that, he needed victory in the field and to convince the Allies that his resources were by no means exhausted.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 103</ref>\n\n[[Image:John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.png|thumb|left|170px|''John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough'' (1650\u20131722) by [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]].]]\n\nFollowing the successes in Italy and along the Rhine, Louis XIV was now hopeful of similar results in Flanders. Far from standing on the defensive therefore \u2013 and unbeknown to Marlborough \u2013 Louis XIV was persistently goading his marshal into action. \"[Villeroi] began to imagine,\" wrote [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|St Simon]], \"that the King doubted his courage, and resolved to stake all at once in an effort to vindicate himself.\"<ref>Saint-Simon: ''Memoirs, vol i,'' 298</ref> Accordingly, on 18 May, Villeroi set off from [[Leuven]] at the head of 70 [[battalion]]s, 132 [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadron]]s and 62 [[cannon]] \u2013 comprising an overall force of some 60,000 troops \u2013 and crossed the river [[Dijle|Dyle]] to seek battle with the enemy. Spurred on by his growing confidence in his ability to out-general his opponent, and by [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]\u2019 determination to avenge Blenheim, Villeroi and his generals anticipated success.<ref>Villeroi was convinced that Marlborough had won the Battle of Blenheim by mere chance.</ref>\n\nNeither opponent expected the clash at the exact moment or place where it occurred.<ref name=chandler172>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 172</ref> The French moved first to [[Tienen]], (as if to threaten [[Zoutleeuw]], abandoned by the French in October 1705), before turning southwards, heading for [[Jodoigne]] \u2013 this line of march took Villeroi\u2019s army towards the narrow aperture of dry ground between the [[Mehaigne]] and Petite Gheete rivers close to the small villages of Ramillies and Taviers; but neither commander quite appreciated how far his opponent had travelled. Villeroi still believed (on 22 May) the Allies were a full day\u2019s march away when in fact they had camped near Corswaren waiting for the Danish squadrons to catch up; for his part, Marlborough deemed Villeroi still at Jodoigne when in reality he was now approaching the plateau of Mont St. Andr\u00e9 with the intention of pitching camp near Ramillies (see map at right).<ref name=chandler172/> However, the Prussian infantry was not there. Marlborough wrote to [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1672\u20131739)|Lord Raby]], the English resident at Berlin: \"If it should please God to give us victory over the enemy, the Allies will be little obliged to the King [Frederick] for the success.\"<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 104</ref>\n\nThe following day, at 01:00, Marlborough dispatched [[William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan|Cadogan]], his Quartermaster-General, with an advanced guard to reconnoitre the same dry ground that Villeroi's army was now heading toward, country that was well known to the Duke from previous campaigns. Two hours later the Duke followed with the main body: 74 battalions, 123 squadrons, 90 pieces of artillery and 20 mortars, totalling 62,000 troops.<ref name=barnett161>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 161</ref> At about 08:00, after Cadogan had just passed Merdorp, his force made brief contact with a party of French [[hussar]]s gathering forage on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille. After a brief exchange of shots the French retired and Cadogan's dragoons pressed forward. With a short lift in the mist, Cadogan soon discovered the smartly ordered lines of Villeroi's advance guard some {{convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} off; a galloper hastened back to warn Marlborough. Two hours later the Duke, accompanied by the Dutch field commander Field Marshal [[Henry de Nassau, Lord Overkirk|Overkirk]], General Daniel Dopff, and the Allied staff, rode up to Cadogan where on the horizon to the westward he could discern the massed ranks of the French army deploying for battle along the {{convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} front.<ref name=barnett161/> Marlborough later told Bishop Burnet that, \u2018the French army looked the best of any he had ever seen\u2019.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 106</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n===Battlefield===\nThe battlefield of Ramillies is very similar to that of Blenheim, for here too there is an immense area of arable land unimpeded by woods or hedges.<ref name=barnett162>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 162</ref> Villeroi's right rested on the villages of Franquen\u00e9e and Taviers, with the river Mehaigne protecting his flank. A large open plain, about {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, lay between Taviers and Ramillies, but unlike Blenheim, there was no stream to hinder the cavalry. His centre was secured by Ramillies itself, lying on a slight eminence which gave distant views to the north and east. The French left flank was protected by broken country, and by a stream, the Petite Gheete, which runs deep between steep and slippery slopes. On the French side of the stream the ground rises to Offus, the village which, together with Autre-Eglise farther north, anchored Villeroi's left flank. To the west of the Petite Gheete rises the plateau of Mont St. Andr\u00e9; a second plain, the plateau of Jandrenouille \u2013 upon which the Anglo-Dutch army amassed \u2013 rises to the east.<ref name=barnett162/>\n\n===Initial dispositions===\n[[Image:Ramillies 1706, initial attack.png|thumb|250px|Initial attack at the Battle of Ramillies, 23 May 1706. To the south, between Taviers and Ramillies, both commanders positioned the bulk of their cavalry. It was here where Marlborough made the breakthrough.]]\n\nAt 11:00, the Duke ordered the army to take standard battle formation. On the far right, towards Foulz, the British battalions and squadrons took up their posts in a double line near the Jeuche stream. The centre was formed by the mass of Dutch, German, Protestant Swiss and Scottish infantry \u2013 perhaps 30,000 men \u2013 facing Offus and Ramillies. Also facing Ramillies Marlborough placed a powerful battery of thirty 24-pounders, dragged into position by a team of oxen; further batteries were positioned overlooking the Petite Gheete. On their left, on the broad plain between Taviers and Ramillies \u2013 and where Marlborough thought the decisive encounter must take place<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 163</ref> \u2013 Overkirk drew the 69 squadrons of the Dutch and Danish horse, supported by 19 battalions of Dutch infantry and two artillery pieces.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 173</ref>\n\n[[Image:Joseph Vivien 001.jpg|thumb|170px|left|''Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria'', (1662\u20131726) by [[Joseph Vivien]]]]\n\nMeanwhile, Villeroi deployed his forces. In Taviers on his right, he placed two battalions of the Greder Suisse R\u00e9giment, with a smaller force forward in Franquen\u00e9e; the whole position was protected by the boggy ground of the Mehaigne river, thus preventing an Allied flanking movement.<ref>Falkner: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714,'' 50</ref> In the open country between Taviers and Ramillies, he placed 82 squadrons under General de Guiscard supported by several interleaved brigades of French, Swiss and Bavarian infantry. Along the Ramillies\u2013Offus\u2013Autre Eglise ridge-line, Villeroi positioned Walloon and Bavarian infantry, supported by the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria's]] 50 squadrons of Bavarian and Walloon cavalry placed behind on the plateau of Mont St. Andr\u00e9. Ramillies, Offus and Autre-Eglise were all packed with troops and put in a state of defence, with alleys barricaded and walls loop-holed for [[muskets]].<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 51</ref> Villeroi also positioned powerful batteries near Ramillies. These guns (some of which were of the three barrelled kind first seen at Elixheim the previous year) enjoyed good arcs of fire, able to fully cover the approaches of the plateau of Jandrenouille over which the Allied infantry would have to pass.\n\nMarlborough, however, noticed several important weaknesses in the French dispositions.<ref>Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe,'' 30</ref> Tactically, it was imperative for Villeroi to occupy Taviers on his right and Autre-Eglise on his left, but by adopting this posture he had been forced to over-extend his forces.<ref name=lynn304>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714,'' 304</ref> Moreover, this disposition \u2013 concave in relation to the Allied army \u2013 gave Marlborough the opportunity to form a more compact line, drawn up in a shorter front between the \u2018horns\u2019 of the French crescent; when the Allied blow came it would be more concentrated and carry more weight. Additionally, the Duke's disposition facilitated the transfer of troops across his front far more easily than his foe, a tactical advantage that would grow in importance as the events of the afternoon unfolded.<ref name=lynn304/> Although Villeroi had the option of enveloping the flanks of the Allied army as they deployed on the plateau of Jandrenouille \u2013 threatening to encircle their army \u2013 the Duke correctly gauged that the characteristically cautious French commander was intent on a defensive battle along the ridge-line.<ref>Falkner: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714,'' 55</ref>\n\n===Taviers===\nAt 13:00 the batteries went into action; a little later two Allied columns set out from the extremities of their line and attacked the flanks of the Franco-Bavarian army.<ref name=chandlertwo31>Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe,'' 31</ref> To the south the [[Dutch Blue Guards|Dutch Guards]], under the command of Colonel Wertm\u00fcller, came forward with their two field guns to seize the hamlet of Franquen\u00e9e. The small Swiss garrison in the village, shaken by the sudden onslaught and unsupported by the battalions to their rear, were soon compelled back towards the village of Taviers. Taviers was of particular importance to the Franco-Bavarian position: it protected the otherwise unsupported flank of General de Guiscard's cavalry on the open plain, while at the same time, it allowed the French infantry to pose a threat to the flanks of the Dutch and Danish squadrons as they came forward into position.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 57</ref> But hardly had the retreating Swiss rejoined their comrades in that village when the Dutch Guards renewed their attack. The fighting amongst the alleys and cottages soon deteriorated into a fierce bayonet and clubbing ''m\u00eal\u00e9e'', but the superiority in Dutch firepower soon told. The accomplished French officer, Colonel de la Colonie, standing on the plain nearby remembered \u2013 \"this village was the opening of the engagement, and the fighting there was almost as murderous as the rest of the battle put together.\"<ref>La Colonie: ''The Chronicles of an old Campaigner,'' 306</ref> By about 15:00 the Swiss had been pushed out of the village into the marshes beyond.\n\n[[Image:Fran\u00e7ois de Neufville, duc de Villeroi.png|thumb|170px|left|''Fran\u00e7ois de Neufville, Duke of Villeroi, Marshal of France'', (1644\u20131730) by [[Alexandre-Fran\u00e7ois Caminade]]. The Battle of Ramillies was Villeroi's last command.]]\n\nVilleroi's right flank fell into chaos and was now open and vulnerable.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 61</ref> Alerted to the situation de Guiscard ordered an immediate attack with 14 squadrons of French dragoons currently stationed in the rear. Two other battalions of the Greder Suisse R\u00e9giment were also sent, but the attack was poorly co-ordinated and consequently went in piecemeal. The Anglo-Dutch commanders now sent dismounted Dutch dragoons into Taviers, which, together with the Guards and their field guns, poured concentrated musketry- and canister-fire into the advancing French troops. Colonel d\u2019Aubigni, leading his regiment, fell mortally wounded.<ref name=colonie309>La Colonie: ''The Chronicles of an old Campaigner,'' 309</ref>\n\nAs the French ranks wavered, the leading squadrons of W\u00fcrttemberg's Danish horse \u2013 now unhampered by enemy fire from either village \u2013 were also sent into the attack and fell upon the exposed flank of the Franco-Swiss infantry and dragoons.<ref name=chandler175>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 175</ref> De la Colonie, with his Grenadiers Rouge regiment, together with the Cologne Guards who were brigaded with them, was now ordered forward from his post south of Ramillies to support the faltering counter-attack on the village. But on his arrival, all was chaos \u2013 \"Scarcely had my troops got over when the dragoons and Swiss who had preceded us, came tumbling down upon my battalions in full flight \u2026 My own fellows turned about and fled along with them.\"<ref name=colonie309/> De La Colonie managed to rally some of his grenadiers, together with the remnants of the French dragoons and Greder Suisse battalions, but it was an entirely peripheral operation, offering only fragile support for Villeroi's right flank.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 65</ref>\n\n===Offus and Autre-Eglise===\n[[Image:George Hamilton, Earl of Orkney.jpg|thumb|170px|''Field Marshal George Hamilton 1666\u20131737 Earl of Orkney'', by [[Martin Maingaud]]]]\n\nWhile the attack on Taviers went on the [[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Earl of Orkney]] launched his first line of English across the Petite Gheete in a determined attack against the barricaded villages of Offus and Autre-Eglise on the Allied right. Villeroi, posting himself near Offus, watched anxiously the redcoats' advance, mindful of the counsel he had received on 6 May from Louis XIV \u2013 \"Have particular care to that part of the line which will endure the first shock of the English troops.\"<ref name=chandlertwo31/> Heeding this advice the French commander began to transfer battalions from his centre to reinforce the left, drawing more foot from the already weakened right to replace them.<ref name=chandler175/>\n\nAs the English battalions descended the gentle slope of the Petite Gheete valley, struggling through the boggy stream, they were met by Major General de la Guiche's disciplined Walloon infantry sent forward from around Offus. After concentrated volleys, exacting heavy casualties on the redcoats, the Walloons reformed back to the ridgeline in good order. The English took some time to reform their ranks on the dry ground beyond the stream and press on up the slope towards the cottages and barricades on the ridge.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 69</ref> The vigour of the English assault, however, was such that they threatened to break through the line of the villages and out onto the open plateau of Mont St Andr\u00e9 beyond. This was potentially dangerous for the Allied infantry who would then be at the mercy of the Elector's Bavarian and Walloon squadrons patiently waiting on the plateau for the order to move.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 71</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Henry Lumley]]\u2019s English cavalry had managed to cross the marshy ground around the Petite Gheete, it was soon evident to Marlborough that sufficient cavalry support would not be practicable and that the battle could not be won on the Allied right.<ref name=chandler176>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 176</ref> The Duke, therefore, called off the attack against Offus and Autre-Eglise. To make sure that Orkney obeyed his order to withdraw, Marlborough sent his Quartermaster-General in person with the command. Despite Orkney's protestations, Cadogan insisted on compliance and, reluctantly, Orkney gave the word for his troops to fall back to their original positions on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille. It is still not clear how far Orkney's advance was planned only as a feint; according to historian David Chandler it is probably more accurate to surmise that Marlborough launched Orkney in a serious probe with a view to sounding out the possibilities of the sector.<ref name=chandler175/> Nevertheless, the attack had served its purpose. Villeroi had given his personal attention to that wing and strengthened it with large bodies of horse and foot that ought to have been taking part in the decisive struggle south of Ramillies.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 109</ref>\n\n===Ramillies===\n[[File:1706-05-23-Slag bij Ramillies.jpg|thumb|250px|The Battle of Ramillies]]\nMeanwhile, the Dutch assault on Ramillies was gaining pace. Marlborough's younger brother, General of Infantry, [[Charles Churchill (British Army general)|Charles Churchill]], ordered four brigades of foot to attack the village. The assault consisted of 12 battalions of Dutch infantry commanded by Major Generals Schultz and Spaar; two brigades of Saxons under [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg|Count Schulenburg]]; a Scottish brigade in Dutch service led by the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|2nd Duke of Argyle]]; and a small brigade of Protestant Swiss.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 75</ref> The 20 French and Bavarian battalions in Ramillies, supported by the Irish dragoons who had left Ireland in the [[Flight of the Wild Geese]] to join [[Clare's Dragoons]] and a small brigade of Cologne and Bavarian Guards under the [[Alessandro, Marquis de Maffei|Marquis de Maffei]], put up a determined defence, initially driving back the attackers with severe losses<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 77</ref> as commemorated in the song ''Clare's Dragoons'':\n<poem>\nWhen on Ramillies' bloody field\nThe baffled French were forced to yield,\nThe victor Saxon backward reeled\nBefore the charge of Clare's Dragoons.\n\n''Viva l\u00e0, the new brigade!''\n''Viva l\u00e0 the old one too!''\n''Viva l\u00e0, the Rose shall fade''\n''The Shamrock shine forever new!''\n</poem>\nSeeing that Schultz and Spaar were faltering, Marlborough now ordered Orkney's second-line British and Danish battalions (who had not been used in the assault on Offus and Autre-Eglise) to move south towards Ramillies. Shielded as they were from observation by a slight fold in the land, their commander, Brigadier-General Van Pallandt, ordered the regimental colours to be left in place on the edge of the plateau to convince their opponents they were still in their initial position. Therefore, unbeknown to the French who remained oblivious to the Allies\u2019 real strength and intentions on the opposite side of the Petite Gheete, Marlborough was throwing his full weight against Ramillies and the open plain to the south. Villeroi meanwhile, was still moving more reserves of infantry in the opposite direction towards his left flank; crucially, it would be some time before the French commander noticed the subtle change in emphasis of the Allied dispositions.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 78</ref>\n\n[[Image:Hendrik van Nassau-Ouwerkerk.jpg|thumb|170px|''Henry of Nassau, Lord of Overkirk'' (1640\u20131708)]]\n\nAt around 15:30, Overkirk advanced his massed squadrons on the open plain in support of the infantry attack on Ramillies. Overkirk's squadrons \u2013 48 Dutch, supported on their left by 21 Danish \u2013 steadily advanced towards the enemy (taking care not to prematurely tire the horses), before breaking into a trot to gain the impetus for their charge.<ref>La Colonie: ''The Chronicles of an old Campaigner,'' 313</ref> The [[Antoine de Pas de Feuqui\u00e8res|Marquis de Feuqui\u00e8res]] writing after the battle described the scene \u2013 \"They advanced in four lines \u2026 As they approached they advanced their second and fourth lines into the intervals of their first and third lines; so that when they made their advance upon us, they formed only one front, without any intermediate spaces.\"<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 80</ref>\n\nThe initial clash favoured the Dutch and Danish squadrons. The disparity of numbers \u2013 exacerbated by Villeroi stripping their ranks of infantry to reinforce his left flank \u2013 enabled Overkirk's cavalry to throw the first line of French horse back in some disorder towards their second-line squadrons. This line also came under severe pressure and, in turn, was forced back to their third-line of cavalry and the few battalions still remaining on the plain.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 81</ref> But these French horsemen were amongst the best in Louis XIV's army \u2013 the ''[[Maison militaire du roi de France|Maison du Roi]]'',<ref>Maison du Roi (Household Cavalry): The mounted elements of the French ''Maison du Roi'' at Ramillies consisted of the ''Gardes du Corps'', the ''Royal Carabiniers'', the ''Mousquetaires'', the ''Compagnie des Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval'' and the ''Compagnie des Gens d\u2019Armes''.</ref> supported by four elite squadrons of Bavarian Cuirassiers. Ably led by de Guiscard, the French cavalry rallied, thrusting back the Allied squadrons in successful local counterattacks.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 82</ref> On Overkirk's right flank, close to Ramillies, ten of his squadrons suddenly broke ranks and were scattered, riding headlong to the rear to recover their order, leaving the left flank of the Allied assault on Ramillies dangerously exposed. Notwithstanding the lack of infantry support, de Guiscard threw his cavalry forward in an attempt to split the Allied army in two.\n\n[[Image:Decapitation of Colonel Bringfield.png|thumb|left|170px|Ten of Diamonds: The decapitation of Colonel Bringfield. A monument to Bringfield in the north aisle of [[Westminster Abbey]] recalls the tale.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 113</ref>]]\n\nA crisis threatened the centre, but from his vantage point Marlborough was at once aware of the situation.<ref name=chandler176/> The Allied commander now summoned the cavalry on the right wing to reinforce his centre, leaving only the English squadrons in support of Orkney. Thanks to a combination of battle-smoke and favourable terrain, his redeployment went unnoticed by Villeroi who made no attempt to transfer any of his own 50 unused squadrons.<ref name=chandler176/> While he waited for the fresh reinforcements to arrive, Marlborough flung himself into the ''m\u00eal\u00e9e'', rallying some of the Dutch cavalry who were in confusion. But his personal involvement nearly led to his undoing. A number of French horsemen, recognising the Duke, came surging towards his party. Marlborough's horse tumbled and the Duke was thrown \u2013 \"Milord Marlborough was rid over,\" wrote Orkney some time later.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 83</ref> It was a critical moment of the battle. \"Major-General Murray,\" recalled one eye witness, \" \u2026 seeing him fall, marched up in all haste with two Swiss battalions to save him and stop the enemy who were hewing all down in their way.\"<ref name=barnett168>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 168</ref> Fortunately Marlborough's newly appointed aide-de-camp, [[Richard Molesworth, 3rd Viscount Molesworth|Richard Molesworth]], galloped to the rescue, mounted the Duke on his horse and made good their escape, before Murray's disciplined ranks threw back the pursuing French troopers.<ref name=barnett168/>\n\nAfter a brief pause, Marlborough's equerry, Colonel Bringfield (or Bingfield), led up another of the Duke's spare horses; but while assisting him onto his mount, the unfortunate Bringfield was hit by an errant cannonball that sheared off his head. One account has it that the cannonball flew between the Captain-General's legs before hitting the unfortunate colonel, whose torso fell at Marlborough's feet \u2013 a moment subsequently depicted in a lurid set of contemporary playing cards.<ref name=barnett168/> Nevertheless, the danger passed, enabling the Duke to attend to the positioning of the cavalry reinforcements feeding down from his right flank \u2013 a change of which Villeroi remained blissfully unaware.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 85</ref>\n\n===Breakthrough===\n[[Image:Ramillies 1706, breakthrough and pursuit.PNG|thumb|250px|Allied squadrons transferred from north to south gave the Allies a 5\u20133 advantage on the plain where some 25,000 French and Allied cavalry were heavily engaged.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 177</ref>]]\n\nThe time was about 16:30, and the two armies were in close contact across the whole {{convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} front, from the skirmishing in the marshes in the south, through the vast cavalry battle on the open plain; to the fierce struggle for Ramillies at the centre, and to the north, where, around the cottages of Offus and Autre-Eglise, Orkney and de la Guiche faced each other across the Petite Gheete ready to renew hostilities.\n\nThe arrival of the transferring squadrons now began to tip the balance in favour of the Allies. Tired, and suffering a growing list of casualties, the numerical inferiority of Guiscard's squadrons battling on the plain at last began to tell.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 87</ref> After earlier failing to hold or retake Franquen\u00e9e and Taviers, Guiscard's right flank had become dangerously exposed and a fatal gap had opened on the right of their line. Taking advantage of this breach, W\u00fcrttemberg's Danish cavalry now swept forward, wheeling to penetrate the flank of the Maison du Roi whose attention was almost entirely fixed on holding back the Dutch. Sweeping forwards, virtually without resistance, the 21 Danish squadrons reformed behind the French around the area of the Tomb of Ottomond, facing north across the plateau of Mont St Andr\u00e9 towards the exposed flank of Villeroi's army.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 177. Trevelyan calls this the decisive manoeuvre of the day.</ref>\n\nThe final Allied reinforcements for the cavalry contest to the south were at last in position; Marlborough's superiority on the left could no longer be denied, and his fast-moving plan took hold of the battlefield. Now, far too late, Villeroi tried to redeploy his 50 unused squadrons, but a desperate attempt to form line facing south, stretching from Offus to Mont St Andr\u00e9, floundered amongst the baggage and tents of the French camp carelessly left there after the initial deployment.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 116. After the retreat had become general, further disaster and confusion resulted from the block of waggons breaking down in the mud. The artillery could not pass, resulting in the loss of most of Villeroi\u2019s cannon.</ref> The Allied commander ordered his cavalry forward against the now heavily outnumbered French and Bavarian horsemen. De Guiscard's right flank, without proper infantry support, could no longer resist the onslaught and, turning their horses northwards, they broke and fled in complete disorder.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 92</ref> Even the squadrons currently being scrambled together by Villeroi behind Ramillies could not withstand the onslaught. \"We had not got forty yards on our retreat,\" remembered Captain Peter Drake, an Irishmen serving with the French \u2013 \"when the words ''sauve qui peut'' went through the great part, if not the whole army, and put all to confusion\"<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 115</ref>\n\nIn Ramillies the Allied infantry, now reinforced by the English troops brought down from the north, at last broke through. The R\u00e9giment de Picardie stood their ground but were caught between Colonel Borthwick's Scots-Dutch regiment and the English reinforcements. Borthwick was killed, as was [[Charles O'Brien, 5th Viscount Clare|Charles O\u2019Brien]], the Irish Viscount Clare in French service, fighting at the head of his regiment.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 94</ref> The Marquis de Maffei attempted one last stand with his Bavarian and Cologne Guards, but it proved in vain.

In addition, hundreds of French soldiers were fugitives, many of whom would never remuster to the [[Colours, standards and guidons|colours]]. Villeroi also lost 52 artillery pieces and his entire engineer [[Pontoon bridge|pontoon]] train.<ref name =falkner105>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 105</ref> In the words of Marshal Villars, the French defeat at Ramillies was \u2013 \"The most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs.\"<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 170</ref>\n\nTown after town now succumbed to the Allies. [[Leuven]] fell on 25 May 1706; three days later, the Allies entered [[Brussels]], the capital of the Spanish Netherlands. Marlborough realised the great opportunity created by the early victory of Ramillies: \"We now have the whole summer before us,\" wrote the Duke from Brussels to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], \"and with the blessing of God I shall make the best use of it.\"<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 179</ref> [[Mechelen|Malines]], [[Lier, Belgium|Lierre]], [[Ghent]], [[Aalst, Belgium|Alost]], [[Damme]], [[Oudenaarde]], [[Bruges]], and on 6 June [[Antwerp]], all subsequently fell to Marlborough's victorious army and, like Brussels, proclaimed the Austrian candidate for the Spanish throne, the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]], as their sovereign.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 121</ref> Villeroi was helpless to arrest the process of collapse. When Louis XIV learnt of the disaster he recalled Marshal Vend\u00f4me from northern Italy to take command in Flanders; but it would be weeks before the command changed hands.\n\n[[Image:Ramillies campaign 1706 - Allied gains.png|thumb|300px|left|Allied gains of the Ramillies campaign 1706. (Note: Dates of capitulation differ slightly depending on source).]]\n\nAs news spread of the Allies\u2019 triumph, the Prussians, Hessians and Hanoverian contingents, long delayed by their respective rulers, eagerly joined the pursuit of the broken French and Bavarian forces. \"This,\" wrote Marlborough wearily, \"I take to be owing to our late success.\"<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 116</ref> Meanwhile, Overkirk took the port of [[Ostend]] on 4 July thus opening a direct route to the [[English Channel]] for communication and supply, but the Allies were making scant progress against [[Dendermonde]] whose governor, the [[Marquis de Val\u00e9e]], was stubbornly resisting. Only later when Cadogan and Churchill went to take charge did the town's defences begin to fail.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 118</ref>\n\nVend\u00f4me formally took over command in Flanders on 4 August;<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 181.

Dendermonde finally succumbed on 6 September followed by [[Ath]] \u2013 the last conquest of 1706 \u2013 on 2 October.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 182</ref> By the time Marlborough had closed down the Ramillies campaign he had denied the French most of the Spanish Netherlands west of the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and north of the [[Sambre]] \u2013 it was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English Duke but once again it was not decisive as these gains did not defeat France.<ref name=lynn308/>\n\nThe immediate question for the Allies now was how to deal with the Spanish Netherlands, a subject which the Austrians and the Dutch were diametrically opposed.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 132</ref> Emperor Joseph I, acting on behalf of his younger brother King \u2019Charles III\u2019, absent in Spain, claimed that reconquered Brabant and Flanders should be put under immediate possession of a governor named by himself. The Dutch, however, who had supplied the major share of the troops and money to secure the victory (the Austrians had produced nothing of either) claimed the government of the region till the war was over, and that after the peace they should continue to garrison Barrier Fortresses stronger than those which had fallen so easily to Louis XIV's forces in 1701. Marlborough mediated between the two parties but favoured the Dutch position. To sway the Duke's opinion, the Emperor offered Marlborough the governorship of the Spanish Netherlands. It was a tempting offer, but in the name of Allied unity, it was one he refused.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 135. Marlborough never fully abandoned the hope that one day he might be proclaimed governor of the Spanish Netherlands. It was his own personal ambition that created mutual suspicion between the Duke and the Dutch.</ref> In the end England and the Dutch Republic took control of the newly won territory for the duration of the war; after which it was to be handed over to the direct rule of \u2018Charles III\u2019, subject to the reservation of a Dutch Barrier, the extent and nature of which had yet to be settled.<ref>The Dutch expected the Belgians to contribute to the cost of the war and the maintenance of the garrisons. Subsequently, the hardships felt by the Belgians led to serious military setbacks when in 1708, Bruges and Ghent swapped sides.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, on the Upper Rhine, Villars had been forced onto the defensive as battalion after battalion had been sent north to bolster collapsing French forces in Flanders; there was now no possibility of his undertaking the re-capture of Landau.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714,'' 309</ref> Further good news for the Allies arrived from northern Italy where, on 7 September, Prince Eugene had routed a French army before the [[Piedmont]]ese capital, [[Battle of Turin|Turin]], driving the Franco-Spanish forces from northern Italy. Only from Spain did Louis XIV receive any good news where [[Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds de Sousa, 2nd Marquess of Minas|Das Minas]] and [[Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway|Galway]] had been forced to retreat from [[Madrid]] towards [[Valencia]], allowing [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] to re-enter his capital on 4 October. All in all though, the situation had changed considerably and Louis XIV began to look for ways to end what was fast becoming a ruinous war for France. For [[Queen Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] also, the Ramillies campaign had one overriding significance \u2013 \"Now we have God be thanked so hopeful a prospect of peace.\"<ref>Gregg: ''Queen Anne,'' 216</ref> Instead of continuing the momentum of victory, however, cracks in Allied unity would enable Louis XIV to reverse some of the major setbacks suffered at Turin and Ramillies.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714,'' 312</ref>\n\n==Casualties==\nThe total number of French casualties cannot be calculated precisely, so complete was the collapse of the Franco-Bavarian army that day.<ref name=falkner105/> [[David G. Chandler]]\u2019s ''Marlborough as Military Commander'' and ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe'' are consistent with regards to French casualty figures i.e., 12,000 dead and wounded plus some 7,000 taken prisoner. James Falkner, in ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' also notes 12,000 dead and wounded and states \u2018up to 10,000\u2019 taken prisoner. In ''The Collins Encyclopaedia of Military History'', Dupuy puts Villeroi's dead and wounded at 8,000, with a further 7,000 captured. Neil Litten, using French archives, suggests 7,000 killed and wounded and 6,000 captured, with a further 2,000 choosing to desert.{{sfn|McNally|2014|p=90}} John Millner's memoirs \u2013 ''Compendious Journal'' (1733) \u2013 is more specific, recording 12,087 of Villeroi's army were killed or wounded, with another 9,729 taken prisoner. In ''Marlborough'', however, [[Correlli Barnett]] puts the total casualty figure as high as 30,000 \u2013 15,000 dead and wounded with an additional 15,000 taken captive. Trevelyan estimates Villeroi's casualties at 13,000, but adds, \u2018his losses by desertion may have doubled that number\u2019. La Colonie omits a casualty figure in his ''Chronicles of an old Campaigner''; but Saint-Simon in his ''Memoirs'' states 4,000 killed, adding 'many others were wounded and many important persons were taken prisoner'. [[Voltaire]], however, in ''Histoire du si\u00e8cle du Louis XIV'' records, 'the French lost there twenty thousand men'.\n\n==See also==\n*The battle was used as the name of several [[Royal Navy]] ships, [[HMS Ramillies|HMS ''Ramillies'']].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n===Primary===\n* La Colonie, Jean Martin de.

Originally intended for writing [[compiler]]s for other languages, BCPL is no longer in common use. However, its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called [[B (programming language)|B]], was the language on which the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] was based.  BCPL introduced several features of modern programming languages, including using [[brace programming language|curly braces]] to delimit code blocks{{Citation needed|reason=BCPL never was an explicite curly braces language, cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:BCPL#Is_BCPL_really_a_%22curly_bracket_language%22?|date=July 2018}}; compilation via [[virtual machine]] [[byte code]]; and the world's first '[[hello world]]' demonstrator program.\n\n==Design==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}\n\n\nBCPL was designed so that small and simple compilers could be written for it; reputedly some compilers could be run in 16 [[kilobyte]]s. Further, the original compiler, itself written in BCPL, was easily portable. BCPL was thus a popular choice for [[bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] a system.{{fact|date=January 2017}}  A major reason for the compiler's portability lay in its structure. It was split into two parts: the front end parsed the source and generated [[O-code machine|O-code]] for a [[virtual machine]], and the back end took the O-code and translated it into the code for the target machine. Only 1/5 of the compiler's code needed to be rewritten to support a new machine, a task that usually took between 2 and 5 [[man-month]]s. This approach became common practice later, e.g., [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], but the original BCPL compiler was the first to define a virtual machine for this purpose.{{fact|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe language is unusual in having only one [[data type]]: a [[Word (data type)|word]], a fixed number of bits, usually chosen to align with the architecture's machine word and of adequate capacity to represent any valid storage address. For many machines of the time, this data type was a 16-bit word. This choice later proved to be a significant problem when BCPL was used on machines in which the smallest addressable item was not a word but a [[byte]], or on machines with larger word sizes such as 32-bit or 64-bit.{{fact|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe interpretation of any value was determined by the operators used to process the values. (For example, + added two values together treating them as [[integer]]s; ! indirected through a value, effectively treating it as a pointer.) In order for this to work, the implementation provided no [[type checking]]. The [[Hungarian notation]] was developed to help programmers avoid inadvertent type errors.{{fact|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe mismatch between BCPL's [[Word (data type)|word orientation]] and [[byte orientation|byte-oriented]] hardware was addressed in several ways. One was providing standard library routines for packing and unpacking words into byte strings. Later, two language features were added: the bit-field selection operator and the infix byte indirection operator (denoted by the '%' character).{{fact|date=January 2017}}\n\nBCPL handles bindings spanning separate [[compilation unit]]s in a unique way. There are no user-declarable global variables; instead there is a global vector, which is similar to \"blank common\" in [[Fortran]].  All data shared between different compilation units comprises scalars and pointers to vectors stored in a pre-arranged place in the global vector.  Thus the header files (files included during compilation using the \"GET\" directive) become the primary means of synchronizing global data between compilation units, containing \"GLOBAL\" directives that present lists of symbolic names, each paired with a number that associates the name with the corresponding numerically addressed word in the global vector.  As well as variables, the global vector also contains bindings for external procedures.  This makes dynamic loading of compilation units very simple to achieve.  Instead of relying on the link loader of the underlying implementation, effectively BCPL gives the programmer control of the linking process.{{fact|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe global vector also made it very simple to replace or augment standard library routines. A program could save the pointer from the global vector to the original routine and replace it with a pointer to an alternative version. The alternative might call the original as part of its processing. This could be used as a quick ''ad hoc'' debugging aid.{{fact|date=January 2017}}\n\nBCPL was the first [[brace programming language]], and the braces survived the syntactical changes and have become a common means of denoting program source code statements. In practice, on limited keyboards of the day, source programs often used the sequences <code>$(</code> and <code>$)</code> in place of the symbols <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>.\nThe single-line <code>//</code> [[comment (computer programming)|comment]]s of BCPL, which were not adopted by [[C (programming language)|C]], reappeared in [[C++]] and later in [[C99]].\n\nThe book ''BCPL: The language and its compiler'' describes the philosophy of BCPL as follows: {{quote|\"The philosophy of BCPL is not one of the tyrant who thinks he knows best and lays down the law on what is and what is not allowed; rather, BCPL acts more as a servant offering his services to the best of his ability without complaint, even when confronted with apparent nonsense.  The programmer is always assumed to know what he is doing and is not hemmed in by petty restrictions.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title=BCPL: The Language and its Compiler|last=Richards|first=Martin|last2=Whitby-Stevens|first2=Colin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980|isbn=978-0521785433|location=|pages=5}}</ref>}}\n\n==Examples==\n\nPrint factorials:\n<pre>\nGET \"LIBHDR\"\n\nLET START() = VALOF $(\n\tFOR I = 1 TO 5 DO\n\t\tWRITEF(\"%N! = %I4*N\", I, FACT(I))\n\tRESULTIS 0\n$)\n\nAND FACT(N) = N = 0 -> 1, N * FACT(N - 1)\n</pre>\n\nCount solutions to the [[Eight queens puzzle|N queens problem]]:\n<pre>\nGET \"LIBHDR\"\n\nGLOBAL $(\n\tCOUNT: 200\n\tALL: 201\n$)\n\nLET TRY(LD, ROW, RD) BE\n\tTEST ROW = ALL THEN\n\t\tCOUNT := COUNT + 1\n\tELSE $(\n\t\tLET POSS = ALL & ~(LD | ROW | RD)\n\t\tUNTIL POSS = 0 DO $(\n\t\t\tLET P = POSS & -POSS\n\t\t\tPOSS := POSS - P\n\t\t\tTRY(LD + P << 1, ROW + P, RD + P >> 1)\n\t\t$)\n\t$)\n\nLET START() = VALOF $(\n\tALL := 1\n\tFOR I = 1 TO 12 DO $(\n\t\tCOUNT := 0\n\t\tTRY(0, 0, 0)\n\t\tWRITEF(\"%I2-QUEENS PROBLEM HAS %I5 SOLUTIONS*N\", I, COUNT)\n\t\tALL := 2 * ALL + 1\n\t$)\n\tRESULTIS 0\n$)\n</pre>\n\n==History==\nBCPL was first implemented by [[Martin Richards (computer scientist)|Martin Richards]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1967.<ref name=\"IEEE_CPA_MRichards\">{{cite web |url=https://www.computer.org/web/awards/pioneer-martin-richards |title=Martin Richards (2003 Computer Pioneer Award) |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |date=<!--Not stated--> |access-date=2017-11-24 |quote= |archive-url=https://archive.is/20171124083723/https://www.computer.org/web/awards/pioneer-martin-richards |archive-date=2017-11-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>  BCPL was a response to difficulties with its predecessor, Cambridge Programming Language, later renamed [[Combined Programming Language]] (CPL), which was designed during the early 1960s. Richards created BCPL by \"removing those features of the full language which make compilation difficult\". The first compiler implementation, for the [[IBM 7094]] under [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] (CTSS), was written while Richards was visiting [[Project MAC]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the spring of 1967. The language was first described in a paper presented to the 1969 Spring Joint Computer Conference.{{fact|date=January 2017}}\n\nBCPL has been rumored to have originally stood for \"Bootstrap Cambridge Programming Language\", but CPL was never created since development stopped at BCPL, and the acronym was later reinterpreted for the BCPL book.{{clarifyme|date=January 2017}}{{fact|date=January 2017}}\n\nBCPL is the language in which the original [[hello world program]] was written.<ref>[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/BCPL.html BCPL], ''[[Jargon File]]''</ref> The first [[MUD]] was also written in BCPL ([[MUD1]]).\n\nSeveral [[operating system]]s were written partially or wholly in BCPL (for example, [[TRIPOS]] and the earliest versions of [[AmigaDOS]]). BCPL was also the initial language used in the seminal [[Xerox PARC]] [[Alto (computer)|Alto]] project, the first modern [[personal computer]]; among other projects, the [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]] [[Word processor|document preparation system]] was written in BCPL.\n\nAn early compiler, bootstrapped in 1969, by starting with a paper tape of the [[O-code]] of Martin Richards's [[Titan (computer)|Atlas 2]] compiler, targeted the [[ICT 1900 series]]. The two machines had different word-lengths (48 vs 24 bits), different character encodings, and different packed string representations\u2014and the successful bootstrapping increased confidence in the practicality of the method.\n\nBy late 1970, implementations existed for the [[GE-600 series|Honeywell 635 and Honeywell 645]], the [[IBM 360]], the [[PDP-10]], the [[TX-2]], the [[CDC 6400]], the [[UNIVAC 1108]], the [[PDP-9]], the [[KDF 9]] and the [[Titan (computer)|Atlas 2]]. In 1974 a dialect of BCPL was implemented at [[BBN Technologies|BBN]] without using the intermediate [[O-code]]. The initial implementation was a [[cross-compiler]] hosted on BBN's [[TOPS-20#TENEX|Tenex]] [[PDP-10]]s, and directly targeted the [[PDP-11]]s used in BBN's implementation of the second generation [[Interface Message Processor|IMPs]] used in the [[Arpanet]].\n\nThere was also a version produced for the [[BBC Micro]] in the mid-1980s, by Richards Computer Products, a company started by John Richards, the brother of Dr. Martin Richards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaron.info/archives/technology/reuters-technical-development-glossary|title=Reuters technical development: Glossary - THE BARON|website=www.thebaron.info}}</ref> The [[BBC Domesday Project]] made use of the language. Versions of BCPL for the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Amstrad PCW]] computers were also released in 1986 by UK software house Arnor Ltd. MacBCPL was released for the Apple Macintosh in 1985 by Topexpress Ltd, of Kensington, England.\n\nBoth the design and philosophy of BCPL strongly influenced [[B (programming language)|B]], which in turn influenced [[C (programming language)|C]].<ref name=\"C_Prog_Lang_KR\">{{cite book |title=The C Programming Language |authors=Kernighan, Brian W. and Dennis M.

The muzzle blasts distort the ocean surface.]]\nA '''battleship''' is a large [[armour|armored]] [[warship]] with a main [[artillery battery|battery]] consisting of large [[caliber]] guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of battleships was considered vital for any nation that desired to maintain [[command of the sea]].\n\nThe term ''battleship'' came into formal use in the late 1880s to describe a type of [[ironclad warship]],<ref name=\"Stoll\">Stoll, J. ''Steaming in the Dark?'', Journal of Conflict Resolution Vol. 36 No. 2, June 1992.</ref> now referred to by historians as [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s. In 1906, the commissioning of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} heralded a revolution in battleship design. Subsequent battleship designs, influenced by HMS ''Dreadnought'', were referred to as \"[[dreadnought]]s\", though the term eventually became obsolete as they became the only type of battleship in common use.\n\nBattleships were a symbol of naval dominance and national might, and for decades the battleship was a major factor in both diplomacy and [[military strategy]].<ref name=\"Sondhaus\">Sondhaus, L. ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'', {{ISBN|0-415-21478-5}}.</ref> A global [[arms race]] in battleship construction began in Europe in the 1890s and culminated at the decisive [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905,<ref>Herwig pp. 35, 41, 42.</ref><ref>Mahan 1890/Dover 1987 pp. 2, 3.</ref><ref>Preston (1982) p. 24.</ref> the outcome of which significantly influenced the design of HMS ''Dreadnought''.<ref>Breyer p. 115.</ref><ref>Massie (1991) p. 471.</ref>  The launch of ''Dreadnought'' in 1906 commenced a new naval arms race. Three major [[fleet action]]s between steel battleships took place: the decisive battles of the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|Yellow Sea (1904)]] and [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima (1905)]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], and the inconclusive [[Battle of Jutland]] (1916) during the First World War. Jutland was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale clash of battleships in the war, and it was the last major battle fought primarily by battleships in world history.<ref>Jeremy Black, \"Jutland's Place in History\", ''Naval History'' (June 2016) 30#3 pp. 16\u201321.</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament|Naval Treaties]] of the 1920s and 1930s limited the number of battleships, though technical innovation in battleship design continued. Both the Allied and Axis powers built battleships during World War II, though the increasing importance of the [[aircraft carrier]] meant that the battleship played a less important role than had been expected.\n\nThe value of the battleship has been questioned, even during their heyday.<ref>{{cite book |author=O'Connell, Robert J. |title= Sacred vessels: the cult of the battleship and the rise of the U.S. Navy |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year= 1993 |pages= |isbn= 978-0-19-508006-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= }} {{Page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> There were few of the decisive fleet battles that battleship proponents expected, and used to justify the vast resources spent on building battlefleets. Even in spite of their huge firepower and protection, battleships were increasingly vulnerable to much smaller and relatively inexpensive weapons: initially the [[torpedo]] and the [[naval mine]], and later aircraft and the [[guided missile]].<ref name=\"Lenton\">Lenton, H. T.: ''Krigsfartyg efter 1860''</ref> The growing range of naval engagements led to the [[aircraft carrier]] replacing the battleship as the leading [[capital ship]] during World War II, with the last battleship to be launched being {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}} in 1944. Four battleships were retained by the [[United States Navy]] until the end of the [[Cold War]] for [[fire support]] purposes and were last used in combat during the [[Gulf War]] in 1991. The last battleships were stricken from the U.S. [[Naval Vessel Register]] in the 2000s.\n\n==Ships of the line==\n{{main|Ship of the line}}\n[[File:TheNapoleonAtToulonIn1852ByLauvergne.jpg|thumb|{{ship|French ship|Napol\u00e9on|1850|2}} (1850), the world's first steam-powered battleship]]\n\nA ship of the line was the dominant warship of its age. It was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship which mounted a [[artillery battery|battery]] of up to 120 [[smoothbore]] [[gun]]s and [[carronade]]s. The ship of the line developed gradually over centuries and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption of [[line of battle]] tactics in the early 17th century and the end of the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.<ref name=\"OED\">\"battleship\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. April 4, 2000.</ref>\n\nThe sheer number of guns fired [[broadside]] meant a ship of the line could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], knocking down [[mast (sailing)|mast]]s, wrecking her [[rigging]], and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was as little as a few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.\n\nThe first major change to the ship of the line concept was the introduction of [[steam power]] as an auxiliary [[marine propulsion|propulsion system]]. Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy in the first half of the 19th century, initially for small craft and later for [[frigate]]s.

In 1859 [[France]] launched {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}}, the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had the profile of a ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations.

As steam technology developed, masts were gradually removed from battleship designs. By the mid-1870s [[steel]] was used as a construction material alongside iron and wood. The French Navy's {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}}, laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876, was a central battery and barbette warship which became the first battleship in the world to use steel as the principal building material.<ref>Conway Marine, \"Steam, Steel and Shellfire\", p. 96.</ref>\n\n==Pre-dreadnought battleship==\n{{main|Pre-dreadnought battleship}}\n[[File:USS Texas2.jpg|thumb|Pre-''Dreadnought'' {{USS|Texas|1892|6}}, built in 1892, was the first battleship of the U.S. Navy.

By the 1890s, there was an increasing similarity between battleship designs, and the type that later became known as the 'pre-dreadnought battleship' emerged. These were heavily armored ships, mounting a mixed battery of guns in turrets, and without sails. The typical first-class battleship of the pre-dreadnought era displaced 15,000 to 17,000&nbsp;[[ton]]s, had a speed of {{convert|16|kn|km/h|0}}, and an armament of four {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns in two turrets fore and aft with a mixed-caliber secondary battery amidships around the superstructure.<ref name=\"Stoll\" /> An early design with superficial similarity to the pre-dreadnought is the British {{sclass-|Devastation|ironclad|4}} of 1871.<ref>Gibbons, Tony: ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Battleships'', p. 101.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Beeler|first1=John|title=Birth of the battleship: British capital ship design 1870-1881|date=2001|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapoli, MD|page=224|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=4&sid=3a1e1f85-3f59-40df-94b1-8b80c9a3e0ec%40sessionmgr110&hid=104&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=lalu.2069172&db=cat00252a|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe slow-firing {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} main guns were the principal weapons for battleship-to-battleship combat. The intermediate and secondary batteries had two roles. Against major ships, it was thought a 'hail of fire' from quick-firing secondary weapons could distract enemy gun crews by inflicting damage to the superstructure, and they would be more effective against smaller ships such as [[cruiser]]s. Smaller guns (12-pounders and smaller) were reserved for protecting the battleship against the threat of torpedo attack from [[destroyer]]s and [[torpedo boat]]s.<ref>Hill, Richard. ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'', {{ISBN|0-304-35273-X}}. {{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe beginning of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with Britain reasserting her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\" /> However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain's navy should be more powerful than the two next most powerful fleets combined was established. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from building more battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\" />\n\n[[File:HMS Agamemnon (1908) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|Diagram of {{HMS|Agamemnon|1906|6}} (1908), a typical late pre-dreadnought battleship]]\nIn the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th, the escalation in the building of battleships became an [[arms race]] between Britain and [[German Empire|Germany]]. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorised a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\" /> Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain's lead was far smaller due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the [[United States]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].<ref name=\"k209\">Kennedy, p. 209.</ref> The Ottoman Empire, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, [[Norway]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]] all had second-rate fleets led by [[armored cruiser]]s, [[coastal defence ship]]s or [[monitor (warship)|monitors]].<ref>Preston, Anthony. ''Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II'' {{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>\n\nPre-dreadnoughts continued the technical innovations of the ironclad. Turrets, armor plate, and [[steam engine]]s were all improved over the years, and [[torpedo]] tubes were introduced. A small number of designs, including the American {{sclass-|Kearsarge|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Virginia|battleship|4}}es, experimented with all or part of the 8-inch intermediate battery superimposed over the 12-inch primary. Results were poor: recoil factors and blast effects resulted in the 8-inch battery being completely unusable, and the inability to train the primary and intermediate armaments on different targets led to significant tactical limitations. Even though such innovative designs saved weight (a key reason for their inception), they proved too cumbersome in practice.<ref>Preston, Anthony.

Created as a result of pressure from Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Sir John (\"Jackie\") Fisher]], HMS ''Dreadnought'' made existing battleships obsolete. Combining an \"all-big-gun\" armament of ten 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns with unprecedented speed (from steam turbine engines) and protection, she prompted navies worldwide to re-evaluate their battleship building programs. While the Japanese had laid down an all-big-gun battleship, {{ship|Japanese battleship|Satsuma||2}}, in 1904<ref>Gibbons, p. 168.</ref> and the concept of an all-big-gun ship had been in circulation for several years, it had yet to be validated in combat. ''Dreadnought'' sparked a new [[arms race]], principally between Britain and Germany but reflected worldwide, as the new class of warships became a crucial element of national power.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Burgess; Heilbrun|first1=Edwin; Margaret|title=Dreadnaught: Britain, Germany, and the Coming of the Great War|journal=Library Journal|date=January 11, 2013|volume=138|issue=18|page=53 |url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=2&sid=59816a76-3b3a-4f13-b731-929e1b898e49%40sessionmgr110&hid=104&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=91632242&db=lfh|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\nTechnical development continued rapidly through the dreadnought era, with steep changes in armament, armor and propulsion. Ten years after ''Dreadnought''{{'}}s commissioning, much more powerful ships, the super-dreadnoughts, were being built.\n\n===Origin===\n[[File:Vittoriocuniberti001.jpg|thumb|upright|Vittorio Cuniberti]]\n\nIn the first years of the 20th century, several navies worldwide experimented with the idea of a new type of battleship with a uniform armament of very heavy guns.\n\nAdmiral [[Vittorio Cuniberti]], the Italian Navy's chief naval architect, articulated the concept of an all-big-gun battleship in 1903. When the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' did not pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in [[Jane's Fighting Ships|''Jane{{'}}s'']] proposing an \"ideal\" future British battleship, a large armored warship of 17,000&nbsp;tons, armed solely with a single calibre main battery (twelve 12-inch [305&nbsp;mm] guns), carrying {{convert|300|mm|in|0|sing=on}} [[belt armor]], and capable of 24 [[knot (unit)|knots]] (44&nbsp;km/h).<ref>Cuniberti, Vittorio, \"An Ideal Battleship for the British Fleet\", ''All The World's Fighting Ships'', 1903, pp. 407\u2013409.</ref>\n\nThe [[Russo-Japanese War]] provided operational experience to validate the \"all-big-gun\" concept. At the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|Yellow Sea]] and [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]], pre-dreadnoughts exchanged volleys at ranges of 7,600\u201312,000 yd (7 to 11&nbsp;km), beyond the range of the secondary batteries. It is often held that these engagements demonstrated the importance of the {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} gun over its smaller counterparts, though some historians take the view that secondary batteries were just as important as the larger weapons.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\" />\n\nIn Japan, the two battleships of the 1903\u201304 Programme were the first to be laid down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was considered too thin, demanding a substantial redesign.<ref>Breyer, ''Battleships and Battlecruisers of the World'', p. 331.</ref> The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns which had to be imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903\u201304 design also retained traditional [[Compound engine|triple-expansion steam engine]]s.<ref>Evans and Peattie, ''Kaigun'', p. 159.</ref>\n\n[[File:Japanese battleship Satsuma.jpg|thumb|left|A preliminary design for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s {{ship|Japanese battleship|Satsuma||2}} was an \"all-big-gun\" design.]]\nAs early as 1904, Jackie Fisher had been convinced of the need for fast, powerful ships with an all-big-gun armament. If Tsushima influenced his thinking, it was to persuade him of the need to standardise on {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\" /> Fisher's concerns were [[submarine]]s and [[destroyer]]s equipped with torpedoes, then threatening to outrange battleship guns, making speed imperative for [[capital ship]]s.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\" /> Fisher's preferred option was his brainchild, the [[battlecruiser]]: lightly armored but heavily armed with eight 12-inch guns and propelled to {{convert|25|kn|km/h|0}} by [[steam turbine]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title= British Battlecruisers 1914\u201318 |last= Burr |first= Lawrence |year= 2006 |publisher= Osprey Publishing |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-84603-008-6 |pages= 4\u20137}}</ref>\n\nIt was to prove this revolutionary technology that ''Dreadnought'' was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, and was the first large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the [[Gun turret|wings]], giving her at her launch twice the [[broadside]] of any other warship. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76&nbsp;mm) [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship in a gun battle, and conceivably win.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 170\u2013171.</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|thumb|right|{{HMS|Dreadnought|1906}}]]\n''Dreadnought'' was to have been followed by three {{sclass-|Invincible|battlecruiser|2}}s, their construction delayed to allow lessons from ''Dreadnought'' to be used in their design. While Fisher may have intended ''Dreadnought'' to be the last Royal Navy battleship,<ref name=\"Sondhaus\" /> the design was so successful he found little support for his plan to switch to a battlecruiser navy. Although there were some problems with the ship (the wing turrets had limited arcs of fire and strained the hull when firing a full broadside, and the top of the thickest armor belt lay below the waterline at full load), the Royal Navy promptly commissioned another six ships to a similar design in the {{sclass-|Bellerophon|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|St. Vincent|battleship|4}}es.\n\nAn American design, {{USS|South Carolina|BB-26|2}}, authorized in 1905 and laid down in December 1906, was another of the first dreadnoughts, but she and her sister, {{USS|Michigan|BB-27|2}}, were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines and had a superior layout of the main battery, dispensing with ''Dreadnought''{{'}}s wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.\n\n===Arms race===\n{{see also|World War I naval arms race (disambiguation){{!}}World War I naval arms race}}\n\nIn 1897, before the revolution in design brought about by HMS ''Dreadnought'', the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and 50 over Germany.<ref name=\"k209\"/> In 1906, the Royal Navy owned the field with ''Dreadnought''. The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences. Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts. Possession of modern battleships was not only seen as vital to naval power, but also, as with nuclear weapons after WWII, represented a nation's standing in the world.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\"/> [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Japan]],<ref name=Ireland_p66/> Italy, Austria, and the United States all began dreadnought programmes; while Ottoman Turkey, [[Argentina]], [[Russia]],<ref name=Ireland_p66>Ireland, Bernard ''Janes War at Sea'', p. 66.</ref> Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.\n\n==World War I==\n{{See also|Naval warfare of World War I}}\nThe battleship, particularly the dreadnought, was the dominant naval weapon of the World War I era. There were few serious challenges at that time. The most significant naval battles of World War I, such as Jutland (May 31, 1916 \u2013 June 1, 1916), were fought by battleships and their battlecruiser cousins.<ref name=Wells_Brothers_2001>{{cite web |url=http://myplace.frontier.com/~wellsbrothers/Battleships/obsolete.html |title=Are Battleships Obsolete? |publisher=the Wells Brothers |date=2001 |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:German High Seas Fleet (Hoschseeflotte) during World War I.jpg|thumb|left|German [[High Seas Fleet]] during [[World War I]]]]\nBy virtue of geography, the Royal Navy was able to use her imposing battleship and battlecruiser fleet to impose a strict and successful naval blockade of Germany and kept [[High Seas Fleet|Germany's smaller battleship fleet]] bottled up in the [[North Sea]]: only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces.<ref>{{cite book |last= Gilbert |first= Adrian |title= The encyclopedia of warfare: from earliest time to the present day, Part 25 |publisher= Taylor & Francis |year= 2000 |page= 224 |isbn= 978-1-57958-216-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MZoO7SIwMVIC&pg=PA224 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would be likely to result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds.<ref>Keegan, p. 289.</ref> This did not happen however, due in large part to the necessity to keep submarines for the Atlantic campaign. Submarines were the only vessels in the Imperial German Navy able to break out and raid British commerce in force, but even though they sank many merchant ships, they could not successfully counter-blockade the United Kingdom; the Royal Navy successfully adopted convoy tactics to combat Germany's submarine counter-blockade and eventually defeated it.<ref name=Wells_Brothers_2001/> This was in stark contrast to Britain's successful battleship blockade of Germany, which was a major cause of Germany's economic collapse in 1918. \n\n[[File:Grand Fleet Assembly (front).jpg|thumb|right|Britain's Grand Fleet]]\nThe first two years of war saw the Royal Navy's battleships and battlecruisers regularly \"sweep\" the North Sea making sure that no German ships could get in or out. Only a few German surface ships that were already at sea, such as the famous light cruiser {{SMS|Emden}}, were able to raid commerce. Even some of those that did manage to get out were hunted down by battlecruisers, as in the [[Battle of the Falklands]], December 7, 1914. The results of sweeping actions in the North Sea were battles such as the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Heligoland Bight]] and [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]] and German raids on the English coast, all of which were attempts by the Germans to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet in an attempt to defeat the Royal Navy in detail. On May 31, 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on German terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the [[Battle of Jutland]].<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 88\u201395.</ref> The German fleet withdrew to port after two short encounters with the British fleet. Less than two months later, the Germans once again attempted to draw portions of the Grand Fleet into battle. The resulting [[Action of 19 August 1916]] proved inconclusive. This reinforced German determination not to engage in a fleet to fleet battle.<ref>Padfield 1972, p. 240.</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Warspite and HMS Malaya during the battle of Jutland.jpg|thumb|left|''Warspite'' and ''Malaya'' at Jutland]]\nIn the other naval theatres there were no decisive pitched battles. In the [[Black Sea]], engagement between [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the [[Baltic Sea]], action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the [[Battle of Moon Sound]] at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] was in a sense the mirror of the North Sea: the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade. And in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].<ref>[[Andrew Marr's The Making of Modern Britain]] Episode 3.</ref>\n\nIn September 1914, the threat posed to surface ships by German U-boats was confirmed by successful attacks on British cruisers, including the sinking of three British [[armored cruiser]]s by the German submarine {{SMU|U-9}} in less than an hour. The British Super-dreadnought {{HMS|Audacious|1912|6}} soon followed suit as she struck a mine laid by a German U-boat in October 1914 and sank. The threat that German U-boats posed to British dreadnoughts was enough to cause the Royal Navy to change their strategy and tactics in the North Sea to reduce the risk of U-boat attack.<ref>Massie, Robert. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. pp. 127\u2013145.</ref> Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships and casualties amongst cruisers led to growing concern in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships.\n\nAs the war wore on however, it turned out that whilst submarines did prove to be a very dangerous threat to older pre-dreadnought battleships, as shown by examples such as the sinking of {{ship|Ottoman ironclad|Mes\u00fbdiye||2}}, which was caught in the [[Dardanelles]] by a British submarine<ref name=\"Compton-Hall 2004\">{{cite book |title= Submarines at War 1914\u201318 |last= Compton-Hall |first= Richard |year= 2004 |publisher= Periscope Publishing Ltd |isbn= 978-1-904381-21-1 |pages= 155\u2013162}}</ref> and {{HMS|Majestic|1895|6}} and {{HMS|Triumph|1903|6}} were torpedoed by ''U-21'' as well as {{HMS|Formidable|1898|6}}, {{HMS|Cornwallis|1901|6}}, {{HMS|Britannia|1904|6}} etc., the threat posed to dreadnought battleships proved to have been largely a false alarm.

In large fleet actions, however, destroyers and torpedo boats were usually unable to get close enough to the battleships to damage them. The only battleship sunk in a fleet action by either torpedo boats or destroyers was the obsolescent German pre-dreadnought {{SMS|Pommern}}. She was sunk by destroyers during the night phase of the Battle of Jutland.\n\nThe German High Seas Fleet, for their part, were determined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines; and since the submarines were needed more for raiding commercial traffic, the fleet stayed in port for much of the war.<ref>Kennedy, pp. 247\u2013249.</ref>\n\n==Inter-war period==\nFor many years, [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] simply had no battleships. The [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice with Germany]] required that most of the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in [[Scapa Flow]], [[Scotland]]. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were [[scuttling|scuttled]] by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any [[capital ship]]s.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', p. 118.</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Nelson (1931) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|Profile drawing of {{HMS|Nelson|28|6}} commissioned 1927]]\nThe inter-war period saw the battleship subjected to strict international limitations to prevent a costly arms race breaking out.<ref>Friedman, Norman.

Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan.<ref>Kennedy, p. 277.</ref> The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the [[Geneva Naval Conference|First Geneva Naval Conference]] (1927), the [[London Naval Treaty|First London Naval Treaty]] (1930), the [[Second Geneva Naval Conference]] (1932), and finally the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on September 1, 1939 at the beginning of [[World War II]], but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply.<ref>Ireland, Bernard. ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 124\u2013126, 139\u2013142.</ref> The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched in 1919\u20131939 than in 1905\u20131914. The treaties also inhibited development by imposing upper limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British {{sclass2-|N3|battleship|2}}, the first American {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship|4||1920}}, and the Japanese {{sclass-|Kii|battleship|4}}\u2014all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor\u2014never got off the drawing board.

K. Edmonds]], flying a [[Short Type 184|Short 184]] seaplane from {{HMS|Ben-my-Chree}} on August 12, 1915, against a 5,000 ton (5,080 tonne) Turkish supply ship in the [[Sea of Marmara]]. Although the enemy ship was hit and sunk, the captain of a British submarine claimed to have fired a torpedo simultaneously and sunk the ship. It was further stated that the British submarine E14 had attacked and immobilised the ship four days earlier. However, on August 17, 1915, another Turkish ship was sunk by a torpedo of whose origin there can be no doubt. On this occasion Flight Commander C. H. Edmonds, flying a Short 184, torpedoed a Turkish steamer a few miles north of the Dardanelles. His formation colleague, Flight Lieutenant G. B. Dacre, was forced to land on the water owing to engine trouble but, seeing an enemy tug close by, taxied up to it and released his torpedo. The tug blew up and sank. Thereafter, Dacre was able to take off and return to the ''Ben-my-Chree''.\"</ref> In 1921 the Italian general and air theorist [[Giulio Douhet]] completed a hugely influential treatise on strategic bombing titled ''The Command of the Air'', which foresaw the dominance of air power over naval units.\n\nIn the 1920s, General [[Billy Mitchell]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps]], believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, testified in front of Congress that \"1,000 bombardment airplanes can be built and operated for about the price of one battleship\" and that a squadron of these bombers could sink a battleship, making for more efficient use of government funds.<ref>[[Walter J.

Air Force Magazine, June 1996.</ref> This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a careful series of bombing tests alongside Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] bombers. In 1921, he bombed and sank numerous ships, including the \"unsinkable\" German World War I battleship {{SMS|Ostfriesland}} and the American pre-dreadnought {{USS|Alabama|BB-8|2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/navybomb2.htm |title=Vice Admiral Alfred Wilkinson Johnson, USN Ret.

The sinking of ''Ostfriesland'' was accomplished by violating an agreement that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions: Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rules, and sank the ship within minutes in a coordinated attack. The stunt made headlines, and Mitchell declared, \"No surface vessels can exist wherever air forces acting from land bases are able to attack them.\" While far from conclusive, Mitchell's test was significant because it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the back foot.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\" /> Rear Admiral [[William A. Moffett]] used public relations against Mitchell to make headway toward expansion of the U.S. Navy's nascent aircraft carrier program.<ref>Jeffers, H. Paul (2006).

Among the new features were an increased tower height and stability for the optical rangefinder equipment (for gunnery control), more armor (especially around turrets) to protect against plunging fire and aerial bombing, and additional anti-aircraft weapons. Some British ships received a large block superstructure nicknamed the \"Queen Anne's castle\", such as in {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|2}} and {{HMS|Warspite|03|2}}, which would be used in the new conning towers of the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|0}} [[fast battleship]]s. External bulges were added to improve both buoyancy to counteract weight increase and provide underwater protection against mines and torpedoes. The Japanese rebuilt all of their battleships, plus their battlecruisers, with distinctive \"[[pagoda]]\" structures, though the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}} received a more modern bridge tower that would influence the new {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|4}}. Bulges were fitted, including steel tube arrays to improve both underwater and vertical protection along the waterline. The U.S. experimented with [[Lattice mast|cage masts]] and later [[tripod mast]]s, though after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] some of the most severely damaged ships (such as {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}} and {{USS|California|BB-44|2}}) were rebuilt with tower masts, for an appearance similar to their {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|0}} contemporaries. Radar, which was effective beyond visual range and effective in complete darkness or adverse weather, was introduced to supplement optical fire control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_fire.htm |title= CombinedFleet.com |publisher= Combinedfleet.com |accessdate= January 31, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090203152004/http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_fire.htm |archivedate= February 3, 2009 |deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nEven when war threatened again in the late 1930s, battleship construction did not regain the level of importance it had held in the years before World War I.

In Britain, the most pressing need was for air defenses and convoy escorts to safeguard the civilian population from bombing or starvation, and re-armament construction plans consisted of five ships of the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|4}}. It was in the Mediterranean that navies remained most committed to battleship warfare. France intended to build six battleships of the {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|4}}es, and the Italians four {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|0}} ships. Neither navy built significant aircraft carriers. The U.S. preferred to spend limited funds on aircraft carriers until the {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship|4||1939}}. Japan, also prioritising aircraft carriers, nevertheless began work on three mammoth ''Yamato''s (although the third, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shinano||2}}, was later completed as a carrier) and a planned fourth was cancelled.<ref name=\"Lenton\" />\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish]] navy included only two small dreadnought battleships, {{ship|Spanish battleship|Espa\u00f1a|1913|2}} and {{ship|Spanish battleship|Jaime I||2}}. ''Espa\u00f1a'' (originally named ''Alfonso XIII''), by then in reserve at the northwestern naval base of [[Ferrol, Spain|El Ferrol]], fell into [[Spain under Franco|Nationalist]] hands in July 1936. The crew aboard ''Jaime I'' remained loyal to the Republic, killed their officers, who apparently supported Franco's attempted coup, and joined the Republican Navy. Thus each side had one battleship; however, the Republican Navy generally lacked experienced officers. The Spanish battleships mainly restricted themselves to mutual blockades, convoy escort duties, and shore bombardment, rarely in direct fighting against other surface units.<ref>Gibbons, p. 195.</ref> In April 1937, ''Espa\u00f1a'' ran into a mine laid by friendly forces, and sank with little loss of life. In May 1937, ''Jaime I'' was damaged by Nationalist air attacks and a grounding incident. The ship was forced to go back to port to be repaired. There she was again hit by several aerial bombs. It was then decided to tow the battleship to a more secure port, but during the transport she suffered an internal explosion that caused 300 deaths and her total loss. Several Italian and German capital ships participated in the non-intervention blockade. On May 29, 1937, two Republican aircraft managed to bomb the German pocket battleship {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}} outside [[Ibiza]], causing severe damage and loss of life. {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} retaliated two days later by bombarding [[Almer\u00eda]], causing much destruction, and the resulting [[Deutschland incident (1937)|''Deutschland'' incident]] meant the end of German and Italian support for non-intervention.<ref>Greger, Ren\u00e9.

Between those two events, it had become clear that aircraft carriers were the new principal ships of the fleet and that battleships now performed a secondary role.\n\nBattleships played a part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theaters; in the Atlantic, the Germans used their battleships as independent commerce raiders. However, clashes between battleships were of little strategic importance. The [[Battle of the Atlantic]] was fought between destroyers and submarines, and most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by [[aircraft carrier]]s.\n\nIn the first year of the war, armored warships defied predictions that aircraft would dominate naval warfare. {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} surprised and sank the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Glorious||2}} off western [[Norway]] in June 1940.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 246\u2013247.</ref> This engagement marked the only time a fleet carrier was sunk by surface gunnery. In the [[attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]], British battleships opened fire on the French battleships in the harbor near Oran in Algeria with their heavy guns, and later pursued fleeing French ships with planes from aircraft carriers.\n\nThe subsequent years of the war saw many demonstrations of the maturity of the aircraft carrier as a strategic naval weapon and its potential against battleships. The British air attack on the Italian naval base at [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]] sank one Italian battleship and damaged two more. The same [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] torpedo bombers played a crucial role in sinking the German battleship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}.\n\n[[File:Yamato under air attack.jpg|thumb|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s ''Yamato'' (1940), seen here under air attack in 1945, and her sister ship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} (1940) were the heaviest battleships in history.]]\nOn December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Within a short time, five of eight U.S. battleships were sunk or sinking, with the rest damaged. All three American aircraft carriers were out to sea, however, and evaded destruction. The [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking]] of the British battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} and battlecruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}}, demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack while at sea without sufficient air cover, settling the argument begun by Mitchell in 1921. Both warships were under way and en route to attack the Japanese amphibious force that had invaded [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]] when they were caught by Japanese land-based [[bomber]]s and [[torpedo bomber]]s on December 10, 1941.<ref>Axell, Albert: ''Kamikaze'', p. 14.</ref>\n\nAt many of the early crucial battles of the Pacific, for instance [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] and [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|4}}, which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46&nbsp;cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never given a chance to show their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in [[Kantai Kessen|Japanese pre-war planning]].<ref>Gibbons, pp. 262\u2013263.</ref>\n\nThe last battleship confrontation in history was the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], on October 25, 1944, in which a numerically and technically superior American battleship group destroyed a lesser Japanese battleship group by gunfire after it had already been devastated by destroyer torpedo attacks. All but one of the American battleships in this confrontation had previously been sunk during the attack on [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] and subsequently raised and repaired. When {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}} fired the last [[salvo]] of this battle, the last salvo fired by a battleship against another heavy ship, she was \"firing a funeral salute to a finished era of naval warfare\".<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''History of US Naval Operations in World War II'' Vol. 12, ''Leyte'', p. 141.</ref> In April 1945, during the battle for [[Okinawa]], the world's most powerful battleship,<ref>Jentschura, Dieter, Mickel p. 39.</ref> the ''Yamato'', was sent out on [[Operation Ten-Go|a suicide mission]] against a massive U.S. force and sunk by overwhelming pressure from carrier aircraft with nearly all hands lost.\n\n==Cold War==\n[[File:Operation Crossroads Baker Edit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Operation Crossroads]]]]\n\nAfter World War II, several navies retained their existing battleships, but they were no longer strategically dominant military assets. Indeed, it soon became apparent that they were no longer worth the considerable cost of construction and maintenance and only one new battleship was commissioned after the war, {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}}. During the war it had been demonstrated that battleship-on-battleship engagements like [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]] or the sinking of {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} were the exception and not the rule, and with the growing role of aircraft engagement ranges were becoming longer and longer, making heavy gun armament irrelevant. The armor of a battleship was equally irrelevant in the face of a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] as tactical missiles with a range of {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} or more could be mounted on the Soviet {{sclass-|Kildin|destroyer|2}} and {{sclass2-|Whiskey|submarine|2}}s. By the end of the 1950s, smaller vessel classes such as destroyers, which formerly offered no noteworthy opposition to battleships, now were capable of eliminating battleships from outside the range of the ship's heavy guns.\n\nThe remaining battleships met a variety of ends. {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|6}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} were sunk during the testing of nuclear weapons in [[Operation Crossroads]] in 1946.

For [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] and his followers, a strong navy was vital to the success of a nation, and control of the seas was vital for the projection of force on land and overseas.  Mahan's theory, proposed in ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History|The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660\u20131783]]'' of 1890, dictated the role of the battleship was to sweep the enemy from the seas.<ref>Massie, Robert K. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. {{ISBN|1-84413-411-3}}. {{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> While the work of escorting, [[blockade|blockading]], and raiding might be done by [[cruiser]]s or smaller vessels, the presence of the battleship was a potential threat to any convoy escorted by any vessels other than capital ships. This concept of \"potential threat\" can be further generalized to the mere existence (as opposed to presence) of a powerful fleet tying the opposing fleet down.  This concept came to be known as a \"[[fleet in being]]\" \u2013 an idle yet mighty fleet forcing others to spend time, resource and effort to actively guard against it.\n\nMahan went on to say victory could only be achieved by engagements between battleships, which came to be known as the ''decisive battle'' doctrine in some navies, while targeting merchant ships ([[commerce raiding]] or ''guerre de course'', as posited by the ''[[Jeune \u00c9cole]]'') could never succeed.<ref>Mahan, A.T., Captain, U.S. Navy. ''Influence of Sea Power on History, 1660\u20131783.'' Boston: Little Brown, ''passim.''</ref>\n\nMahan was highly influential in naval and political circles throughout the age of the battleship,<ref name= \"Sondhaus\" /><ref>Kennedy, pp. 2, 200, 206.</ref> calling for a large fleet of the most powerful battleships possible. Mahan's work developed in the late 1880s, and by the end of the 1890s it had acquired much international influence on naval strategy;<ref name= \"Sondhaus\" /> in the end, it was adopted by many major navies (notably the British, American, German, and Japanese).  The strength of Mahanian opinion was important in the development of the battleships arms races, and equally important in the agreement of the Powers to limit battleship numbers in the interwar era.\n\nThe \"fleet in being\" suggested battleships could simply by their existence tie down superior enemy resources.  This in turn was believed to be able to tip the balance of a conflict even without a battle. This suggested even for inferior naval powers a battleship fleet could have important strategic effect.<ref>{{cite web |first =John |last = Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/fleet-in-being.htm |title= Fleet In Being |publisher= Global security |date= May 3, 2007 |accessdate= January 31, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090213032122/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/fleet-in-being.htm |archivedate= February 13, 2009 |deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n===Tactics===\nWhile the role of battleships in both World Wars reflected Mahanian doctrine, the details of battleship deployment were more complex. Unlike [[ship of the line |ships of the line]], the battleships of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had significant vulnerability to torpedoes and mines\u2014because efficient mines and torpedoes did not exist before that<ref name=Dahl/>\u2014which could be used by relatively small and inexpensive craft. The ''Jeune \u00c9cole'' doctrine of the 1870s and 1880s recommended placing [[torpedo boat]]s alongside battleships; these would hide behind the larger ships until gun-smoke obscured visibility enough for them to dart out and fire their torpedoes.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\" /> While this tactic was vitiated by the development of smokeless propellant, the threat from more capable torpedo craft (later including submarines) remained. By the 1890s, the Royal Navy had developed the first [[destroyer]]s, which were initially designed to intercept and drive off any attacking torpedo boats. During the First World War and subsequently, battleships were rarely deployed without a protective screen of destroyers.<!--this was a continuation of the long tradition of \"like fighting like\"; a mention & cite for it would be good...--><ref>{{cite journal|title=Battleships, Mines, and Torpedoes|journal=Canadian Magazine|date=March 1904|volume=22|pages=501\u2013502|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=2a588fd3-5581-4a9a-a126-7eb7a54b681a%40sessionmgr115&hid=104&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=523750493&db=rgr|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBattleship doctrine emphasised the concentration of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force to be able to bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages [[battlecruisers]], [[cruisers]], destroyers, [[airship]]s, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, [[direction finding]] and [[traffic analysis]] would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.<ref>It could presage an enemy sortie, or locate an enemy over the horizon. Beesly, Patrick. ''Room 40'' (London : Hamish Hamilton)</ref>) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques,<ref>Beesly. {{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.\n\n===Strategic and diplomatic impact===\nThe presence of battleships had a great psychological and diplomatic impact. Similar to possessing [[nuclear weapon]]s today, the ownership of battleships served to enhance a nation's force projection.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\" />\n\nEven during the [[Cold War]], the psychological impact of a battleship was significant. In 1946, USS ''Missouri'' was dispatched to deliver the remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and [[Greece|Greek]] waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the [[Balkans|Balkan]] region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/missouri-iv.htm |title=USS Missouri |accessdate=March 18, 2007 |publisher=Naval Historical Center |website=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100409051417/http%3A//www%2Ehistory%2Enavy%2Emil/danfs/m12/missouri%2Div%2Ehtm |archivedate=April 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> In September 1983, when [[Druze]] militia in [[Lebanon]]'s Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS ''New Jersey'' stopped the firing.

The ideas of the ''Jeune \u00c9cole'' were ahead of their time; it was not until the 20th century that efficient mines, torpedoes, submarines, and aircraft were available that allowed similar ideas to be effectively implemented.<ref name=Dahl/> The determination of powers such as [[German Empire|Germany]] to build battlefleets with which to confront much stronger rivals has been criticised by historians, who emphasise the futility of investment in a battlefleet that has no chance of matching its opponent in an actual battle.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Battleships}}\n* [[Arsenal ship]]\n* [[List of battleships]]\n* [[List of battleships by country]]\n* [[List of battleship classes]]\n* [[List of sunken battleships]]\n* [[List of ships of the Second World War]]\n* [[List of battleships of the Second World War]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last= Appel |first= Erik |title= Finland i krig 1939\u20131940&nbsp;\u2013 f\u00f6rsta delen |year= 2001 |publisher= Schildts f\u00f6rlag Ab |location= Espoo, Finland |language= Swedish |page= 261 |isbn= 978-951-50-1182-4 |displayauthors= etal}}\n* {{cite book |last= Archibald |first= E.

In chapter 13 of ''Gylfaginning'', [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) asks the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] what way exists between heaven and earth. Laughing, High replies that the question isn't an intelligent one, and goes on to explain that the gods built a bridge from heaven and earth. He incredulously asks Gangleri if he has not heard the story before. High says that Gangleri must have seen it, and notes that Gangleri may call it a [[rainbow]]. High says that the bridge consists of three colors, has great strength, \"and is built with art and skill to a greater extent than other constructions.\"<ref name=FAULKES15>Faulkes (1995:15).</ref>\n\nHigh notes that, although the bridge is strong, it will break when \"[[Muspelheim|Muspell]]'s lads\" attempt to cross it, and their horses will have to make do with swimming over \"great rivers.\" Gangleri says that it doesn't seem that the gods \"built the bridge in good faith if it is liable to break, considering that they can do as they please.\" High responds that the gods do not deserve blame for the breaking of the bridge, for \"there is nothing in this world that will be secure when Muspell's sons attack.\"<ref name=FAULKES15/>\n\nIn chapter 15 of ''Gylfaginning'', [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|Just-As-High]] says that Bifr\u00f6st is also called ''Asbr\u00fa'', and that every day the gods ride [[Horses of the \u00c6sir|their horses]] across it (with the exception of Thor, who instead wades through the boiling waters of the rivers [[K\u00f6rmt and \u00d6rmt]]) to reach [[Ur\u00f0arbrunnr]], a holy well where the gods have their court. As a reference, Just-As-High quotes the second of the two stanzas in ''Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l'' that mention the bridge (see above). Gangleri asks if fire burns over Bifr\u00f6st. High says that the red in the bridge is burning fire, and, without it, the frost jotnar and mountain jotnar would \"go up into heaven\" if anyone who wanted could cross Bifr\u00f6st.

They were similar in size, cost, and armament to [[battleship]]s, but carried either less armour, or in the case of German battlecruisers, smaller caliber guns, in order to attain faster speeds. The first battlecruisers were designed in the [[United Kingdom]] in the first decade of the century, as a development of the [[armoured cruiser]], at the same time as the [[dreadnought]] succeeded the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships.\n\nBattlecruisers served in the navies of the [[Royal Navy|UK]], [[German Imperial Navy|Germany]], the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman Empire]], [[Royal Australian Navy|Australia]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japan]] during World War I, most notably at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] and in the several raids and skirmishes in the [[North Sea]] which culminated in a pitched fleet battle, the [[Battle of Jutland]]. British battlecruisers in particular suffered heavy losses at Jutland, where their light armour made them very vulnerable to large-caliber shells. By the end of the war, capital ship design had developed with battleships becoming faster and battlecruisers becoming more heavily armoured, blurring the distinction between a battlecruiser and a [[fast battleship]]. The [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards, treated battleships and battlecruisers identically, and the new generation of battlecruisers planned was scrapped under the terms of the treaty.\n\nImprovements in armor design and propulsion created the 1930s \"fast battleship\" with the speed of a battlecruiser and armor of a battleship, making the battlecruiser in the traditional sense effectively an obsolete concept. Thus from the 1930s on, only the [[Royal Navy]] continued to use \"battlecruiser\" as a classification for the World War I\u2013era capital ships that remained in the fleet; while Japan's battlecruisers remained in service, they had been significantly reconstructed and were re-rated as full-fledged fast battleships.{{refn|The German {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|1}}s and {{sclass-|Deutschland|cruiser|1}}s and the French {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|1}}s are all sometimes referred to as battlecruisers, although the owning navies referred to them as \"battleships\" ({{lang-de|Schlachtschiffe}}), \"armored ships\" ({{lang-de|Panzerschiffe}}) and \"battleships\" ({{lang-fr|B\u00e2timents de ligne}}) respectively. Since neither their operators nor a significant number of naval historians classify them as such, they are not discussed in this article.<ref>Gr\u00f6ner, pp. 31, 60; Gille, p. 139; Koop & Schmolke, p. 4</ref><ref name=\"Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 259\">Chesneau, p. 259</ref><ref>Bidlingmaier, pp. 73\u201374</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nBattlecruisers were put into action again during [[World War II]], and only one survived to the end. There was also renewed interest in large \"cruiser-killer\" type warships, but few were ever begun, as construction of battleships and battlecruisers was curtailed in favor of more-needed convoy escorts, aircraft carriers, and cargo ships. In the post\u2013[[Cold War]] era, the Soviet {{sclass-|Kirov|battlecruiser|4}} of large guided missile cruisers have also been termed \"battlecruisers\".\n\n==Background==\nThe battlecruiser was developed by the [[Royal Navy]] in the first years of the 20th century as an evolution of the [[armoured cruiser]].<ref>Sondhaus, p. 199; Roberts, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe first armoured cruisers had been built in the 1870s, as an attempt to give armour protection to ships fulfilling the typical [[cruiser]] roles of patrol, trade protection and power projection. However, the results were rarely satisfactory, as the weight of armour required for any meaningful protection usually meant that the ship became almost as slow as a battleship. As a result, navies preferred to build [[protected cruiser]]s with an armoured deck protecting their engines, or simply no armour at all.\n\nIn the 1890s, technology began to change this balance. New [[Krupp armour|Krupp steel]] armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the [[Quick firing guns|quick-firing guns]] of enemy battleships and cruisers alike.<ref>Sumida, p. 19</ref> In 1896\u201397 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies in the event of war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In the event of a war between Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the [[British Empire]]'s worldwide trade.<ref>Breyer, p. 47</ref>\n\nBritain, which had concluded in 1892 that it needed twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire's sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers. Between 1899 and 1905, it completed or laid down seven [[ship class|classes]] of this type, a total of 35 ships.<ref>Lambert 2002, pp. 20\u201322; Osborne, pp. 61\u201362</ref> This building program, in turn, prompted the French and Russians to increase their own construction. The [[Imperial German Navy]] began to build large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations, laying down eight between 1897 and 1906.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 142; Osborne, pp. 62, 74</ref>\n\nThe cost of this cruiser arms race was significant. In the period 1889\u20131896, the Royal Navy spent \u00a37.3 million on new large cruisers. From 1897\u20131904, it spent \u00a326.9 million.<ref>Sumida, p. 351, Table 9. Figures are for First-Class Cruisers and exclude armament.</ref> Many armoured cruisers of the new kind were just as large and expensive as the equivalent battleship.\n\n[[File:HMS Shannon (1906).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Shannon|1906|6}}, a ''Minotaur''-class armoured cruiser]]\n\nThe increasing size and power of the armoured cruiser led to suggestions in British naval circles that cruisers should displace battleships entirely. The battleship's main advantage was its 12-inch heavy guns, and heavier armour designed to protect from shells of similar size. However, for a few years after 1900 it seemed that those advantages were of little practical value. The [[torpedo]] now had a range of 2,000 yards, and it seemed unlikely that a battleship would engage within torpedo range. However, at ranges of more than 2,000 yards it became increasingly unlikely that the heavy guns of a battleship would score any hits, as the heavy guns relied on primitive aiming techniques. The secondary batteries of 6-inch quick-firing guns, firing more plentiful shells, were more likely to hit the enemy.<ref>Sumida, pp. 42\u201344</ref> As naval expert [[Fred T. Jane]] wrote in June 1902,<blockquote>Is there anything outside of 2,000 yards that the big gun in its hundreds of tons of medieval castle can effect, that its weight in 6-inch guns without the castle could not effect equally well? And inside 2,000, what, in these days of gyros, is there that the torpedo cannot effect with far more certainty?<ref>Quoted in Sumida, p. 44</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1904, Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John \"Jacky\" Fisher]] became [[First Sea Lord]], the senior officer of the Royal Navy. He had for some time thought about the development of a new fast armoured ship. He was very fond of the \"second-class battleship\" {{HMS|Renown|1895|2}}, a faster, more lightly armoured battleship.<ref>Roberts, p. 15; Mackay, pp. 212\u201313</ref> As early as 1901, there is confusion in Fisher's writing about whether he saw the battleship or the cruiser as the model for future developments. This did not stop him from commissioning designs from [[naval architect]] W. H. Gard for an armoured cruiser with the heaviest possible armament for use with the fleet. The design Gard submitted was for a ship between {{convert|14000|-|15000|LT|t}}, capable of {{convert|25|kn|lk=in}}, armed with four 9.2-inch and twelve {{convert|7.5|in|mm|adj=on}} guns in twin [[gun turret]]s and protected with six inches of armour along her [[belt armour|belt]] and 9.2-inch turrets, {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} on her 7.5-inch turrets, 10 inches on her [[conning tower]] and up to {{convert|2.5|in|mm|0}} on her decks. However, mainstream British naval thinking between 1902 and 1904 was clearly in favour of heavily armoured battleships, rather than the fast ships that Fisher favoured.<ref>Breyer, p. 48</ref>\n\nThe Battle of Tsushima proved conclusively the effectiveness of heavy guns over intermediate ones and the need for a uniform main caliber on a ship for fire control. Even before this, the Royal Navy had begun to consider a shift away from the mixed-calibre armament of the 1890s [[pre-dreadnought]] to an \"all-big-gun\" design, and preliminary designs circulated for battleships with all 12-inch or all 10-inch guns and armoured cruisers with all 9.2-inch guns.<ref>Roberts, pp. 16\u201317</ref> In late 1904, not long after the Royal Navy had decided to use 12-inch guns for its next generation of battleships because of their superior performance at long range, Fisher began to argue that big-gun cruisers could replace battleships altogether. The continuing improvement of the torpedo meant that [[submarine]]s and [[destroyer]]s would be able to destroy battleships; this in Fisher's view heralded the end of the battleship or at least compromised the validity of heavy armour protection. Nevertheless, armoured cruisers would remain vital for commerce protection.<ref>Mackay, pp. 324\u201325; Roberts, pp. 17\u201318; Sumida, p. 52</ref>\n\n{{quote|Of what use is a battle fleet to a country called (A) at war with a country called (B) possessing no battleships, but having fast armoured cruisers and clouds of fast torpedo craft?

In such a case, neither side wanting battleships is presumptive evidence that they are not of much value.|Fisher to [[William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne|Lord Selborne]] ([[First Lord of the Admiralty]]), 20 October 1904<ref>quoted in Sumida, p. 52</ref>}}\n\nFisher's views were very controversial within the Royal Navy, and even given his position as First Sea Lord, he was not in a position to insist on his own approach. Thus he assembled a \"Committee on Designs\", consisting of a mixture of civilian and naval experts, to determine the approach to both battleship and armoured cruiser construction in the future. While the stated purpose of the Committee was to investigate and report on future requirements of ships, Fisher and his associates had already made key decisions.<ref name=R19>Roberts, p. 19</ref> The terms of reference for the Committee were for a battleship capable of {{convert|21|kn}} with 12-inch guns and no intermediate calibres, capable of docking in existing [[drydock]]s;<ref name=\"Breyer\">Breyer, p. 115</ref> and a cruiser capable of {{convert|25.5|kn}}, also with 12-inch guns and no intermediate armament, armoured like {{HMS|Minotaur|1906|2}}, the most recent armoured cruiser, and also capable of using existing docks.<ref name=R19/>\n\n==First battlecruisers==\nUnder the Selborne plan of 1902, the Royal Navy intended to start three new battleships and four armoured cruisers each year. However, in late 1904 it became clear that the 1905\u20131906 programme would have to be considerably smaller, because of lower than expected tax revenue and the need to buy out two Chilean battleships under construction in British yards, lest they be purchased by the Russians for use against the Japanese, Britain's ally. These economies meant that the 1905\u20131906 programme consisted only of one battleship, but three armoured cruisers. The battleship became the revolutionary battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|2}}, and the cruisers became the three ships of the {{sclass-|Invincible|battlecruiser|4}}. Fisher later claimed, however, that he had argued during the Committee for the cancellation of the remaining battleship.<ref>Sumida, p. 55</ref>\n\nThe construction of the new class was begun in 1906 and completed in 1908, delayed perhaps to allow their designers to learn from any problems with ''Dreadnought''.<ref name=\"Breyer\" /><ref>Roberts, pp. 24\u201325</ref> The ships fulfilled the design requirement quite closely. On a displacement similar to ''Dreadnought'', the ''Invincible''s were {{convert|40|ft|m|1}} longer to accommodate additional [[boiler (steam generator)|boilers]] and more powerful [[steam turbine|turbines]] to propel them at {{convert|25|kn}}. Moreover, the new ships could maintain this speed for days, whereas pre-dreadnought battleships could not generally do so for more than an hour.<ref>Burr, pp. 7\u20138</ref> Armed with eight [[BL 12 inch Mk X naval gun|12-inch Mk X guns]], compared to ten on ''Dreadnought'', they had {{convert|6|-|7|in|0}} of armour protecting the hull and the gun turrets. (''Dreadnought''{{'}}s armour, by comparison, was {{convert|11|-|12|in|0}} at its thickest.)<ref>Breyer, pp. 114\u201317</ref> The class had a very marked increase in speed, displacement and firepower compared to the most recent armoured cruisers but no more armour.<ref name=\"GG24\" />\n\nWhile the ''Invincible''s were to fill the same role as the armoured cruisers they succeeded, they were expected to do so more effectively. Specifically their roles were:\n* '''Heavy reconnaissance.''' Because of their power, the ''Invincible''s could sweep away the screen of enemy cruisers to close with and observe an enemy battlefleet before using their superior speed to retire.\n* '''Close support for the battle fleet.''' They could be stationed at the ends of the battle line to stop enemy cruisers harassing the battleships, and to harass the enemy's battleships if they were busy fighting battleships. Also, the ''Invincible''s could operate as the fast wing of the battlefleet and try to outmanouevre the enemy.\n* '''Pursuit.''' If an enemy fleet ran, then the ''Invincible''s would use their speed to pursue, and their guns to damage or slow enemy ships.\n* '''Commerce protection.''' The new ships would hunt down enemy cruisers and commerce raiders.<ref>Roberts, p. 18</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Invincible (1907) British Battleship.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Invincible|1907|2}}, Britain's first battlecruiser]]\nConfusion about how to refer to these new battleship-size armoured cruisers set in almost immediately. Even in late 1905, before work was begun on the ''Invincible''s, a Royal Navy memorandum refers to \"large armoured ships\" meaning both battleships and large cruisers. In October 1906, the Admiralty began to classify all post-Dreadnought battleships and armoured cruisers as \"[[capital ships]]\", while Fisher used the term \"dreadnought\" to refer either to his new battleships or the battleships and armoured cruisers together.<ref>Mackay, pp. 325\u201326</ref> At the same time, the ''Invincible'' class themselves were referred to as \"cruiser-battleships\", \"dreadnought cruisers\"; the term \"battlecruiser\" was first used by Fisher in 1908. Finally, on 24 November 1911, Admiralty Weekly Order No. 351 laid down that \"All cruisers of the \u201cInvincible\u201d and later types are for the future to be described and classified as \u201cbattle cruisers\u201d to distinguish them from the armoured cruisers of earlier date.\"<ref>Admiralty Weekly Orders. 351. \u2013 Description and Classification of Cruisers of the \u201cInvincible\u201d and Later Types.  ADM 182/2, quoted at [http://dreadnoughtproject.org/tfs/index.php/The_Battle_Cruiser_in_the_Royal_Navy#Tactics The Dreadnought Project: The Battle Cruiser in the Royal Navy.]</ref>\n\nAlong with questions over the new ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with which they had been equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The ''Invincible''s were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role.<ref name=GG24>Gardiner & Gray, p. 24</ref><ref name=M494>Massie, p. 494</ref>\n\nBecause of the ''Invincible''s{{'}} size and armament, naval authorities considered them capital ships almost from their inception\u2014an assumption that might have been inevitable. Complicating matters further was that many naval authorities, including Lord Fisher, had made overoptimistic assessments from the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 about the armoured cruiser's ability to survive in a battle line against enemy capital ships due to their superior speed. These assumptions had been made without taking into account the Russian [[Baltic Fleet]]'s inefficiency and tactical ineptitude. By the time the term \"battlecruiser\" had been given to the ''Invincible''s, the idea of their parity with battleships had been fixed in many people's minds.<ref name=\"GG24\"/><ref name=M494/>\n\nNot everyone was so convinced. ''Brassey{{'}}s Naval Annual'', for instance, stated that with vessels as large and expensive as the ''Invincible''s, an admiral \"will be certain to put them in the line of battle where their comparatively light protection will be a disadvantage and their high speed of no value.\"<ref>As quoted in Massie, pp. 494\u201395</ref> Those in favor of the battlecruiser countered with two points\u2014first, since all capital ships were vulnerable to new weapons such as the [[torpedo]], armour had lost some of its validity; and second, because of its greater speed, the battlecruiser could control the range at which it engaged an enemy.<ref>Friedman, p. 10</ref>\n\n==Battlecruisers in the dreadnought arms race==\nBetween the launching of the ''Invincible''s to just after the outbreak of the First World War, the battlecruiser played a junior role in the developing dreadnought arms race, as it was never wholeheartedly adopted as the key weapon in British imperial defence, as Fisher had presumably desired.  The biggest factor for this lack of acceptance was the marked change in Britain's strategic circumstances between their conception and the commissioning of the first ships.  The prospective enemy for Britain had shifted from a Franco-Russian alliance with many armoured cruisers to a resurgent and increasingly belligerent Germany.  Diplomatically, Britain had entered the [[Entente cordiale]] in 1904 and the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]].  Neither France nor Russia posed a particular naval threat; the Russian navy had largely been sunk or captured in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905, while the French were in no hurry to adopt the new [[dreadnought]]-type design.  Britain also boasted very cordial relations with two of the significant new naval powers: Japan (bolstered by the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]], signed in 1902 and renewed in 1905), and the US.  These changed strategic circumstances, and the great success of the ''Dreadnought'' ensured that she rather than the ''Invincible'' became the new model capital ship.  Nevertheless, battlecruiser construction played a part in the renewed naval arms race sparked by the ''Dreadnought''.<ref>Sondhaus, pp. 199\u2013202</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Queen Mary.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Queen Mary}}, the last battlecruiser built before World War I]]\nFor their first few years of service, the ''Invincible''s entirely fulfilled Fisher's vision of being able to sink any ship fast enough to catch them, and run from any ship capable of sinking them. An ''Invincible'' would also, in many circumstances, be able to take on an enemy [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]. Naval circles concurred that the armoured cruiser in its current form had come to the logical end of its development and the ''Invincible''s were so far ahead of any enemy armoured cruiser in firepower and speed that it proved difficult to justify building more or bigger cruisers.<ref>Roberts, p. 25; Mackay, pp. 324\u201325</ref> This lead was extended by the surprise both ''Dreadnought'' and ''Invincible'' produced by having been built in secret; this prompted most other navies to delay their building programmes and radically revise their designs.<ref>Sondhaus, pp. 201\u201302</ref> This was particularly true for cruisers, because the details of the ''Invincible'' class were kept secret for longer; this meant that the last German armoured cruiser, {{SMS|Bl\u00fccher||2}}, was armed with only {{convert|21|cm|adj=on}} guns, and was no match for the new battlecruisers.<ref>Staff, pp. 3\u20134</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy's early superiority in capital ships led to the rejection of a 1905\u20131906 design that would, essentially, have fused the battlecruiser and battleship concepts into what would eventually become the fast battleship. The 'X4' design combined the full armour and armament of ''Dreadnought'' with the 25 knot speed of ''Invincible''. The additional cost could not be justified given the existing British lead and the new Liberal government's need for economy; the slower and cheaper {{HMS|Bellerophon|1907|2}}, a relatively close copy of ''Dreadnought'', was adopted instead.<ref>Roberts, p. 26</ref> The X4 concept would eventually be fulfilled in the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|4}} and later by other navies.<ref>Breyer, pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\nThe next British battlecruisers were the three {{sclass-|Indefatigable|battlecruiser|4}}, slightly improved ''Invincible''s built to fundamentally the same specification, partly due to political pressure to limit costs and partly due to the secrecy surrounding German battlecruiser construction, particularly about the heavy armour of {{SMS|Von der Tann}}.<ref>Roberts, pp. 28\u201329</ref> This class came to be widely seen as a mistake<ref>Brown 1999, p. 57</ref> and the next generation of British battlecruisers were markedly more powerful. By 1909\u20131910 a sense of national crisis about rivalry with Germany outweighed cost-cutting, and a naval panic resulted in the approval of a total of eight capital ships in 1909\u20131910.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 203</ref> Fisher pressed for all eight to be battlecruisers,<ref>Roberts, p. 32</ref> but was unable to have his way; he had to settle for six battleships and two battlecruisers of the {{sclass-|Lion|battlecruiser|4}}. The ''Lion''s carried eight [[BL 13.5 inch Mk V naval gun|13.5-inch guns]], the now-standard caliber of the British \"super-dreadnought\" battleships. Speed increased to {{convert|27|kn}} and armour protection, while not as good as in German designs, was better than in previous British battlecruisers, with {{convert|9|in|adj=on|spell=in}} armour belt and [[barbette]]s. The two ''Lion''s were followed by the very similar {{HMS|Queen Mary||2}}.<ref>Roberts, pp. 31\u201333</ref>\n\n[[File:German battlecruiser SMS Seydlitz in port, prior to World War I (retouched).jpg|thumb|left|SMS ''Seydlitz''|alt=A large gray ship in port. The two funnels in the center of the ship emit clouds of smoke.]]\nBy 1911 Germany had built battlecruisers of her own, and the superiority of the British ships could no longer be assured. Moreover, the German Navy did not share Fisher's view of the battlecruiser. In contrast to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower, Germany progressively improved the armour and staying power of their ships to better the British battlecruisers.<ref>Sondhaus, pp. 202\u201303</ref> ''Von der Tann'', begun in 1908 and completed in 1910, carried eight 11.1-inch guns, but with 11.1-inch (283&nbsp;mm) armour she was far better protected than the ''Invincible''s. The two {{sclass-|Moltke|battlecruiser|5}}s were quite similar but carried ten 11.1-inch guns of an improved design.<ref>Breyer, pp. 269\u201372</ref> {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}, designed in 1909 and finished in 1913, was a modified ''Moltke''; speed increased by one knot to {{convert|26.5|kn}}, while her armour had a maximum thickness of 12 inches, equivalent to the {{sclass-|Helgoland|battleship|2}}s of a few years earlier. ''Seydlitz'' was Germany's last battlecruiser completed before World War I.<ref>Breyer, pp. 267, 272</ref>\n\nThe next step in battlecruiser design came from Japan. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had been planning the {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser|0}} ships from 1909, and was determined that, since the Japanese economy could support relatively few ships, each would be more powerful than its likely competitors. Initially the class was planned with the ''Invincible''s as the benchmark. On learning of the British plans for ''Lion'', and the likelihood that new [[U.S. Navy]] battleships would be armed with {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} guns, the Japanese decided to radically revise their plans and go one better. A new plan was drawn up, carrying eight 14-inch guns, and capable of {{convert|27.5|kn}}, thus marginally having the edge over the ''Lion''s in speed and firepower. The heavy guns were also better-positioned, being [[superfire|superfiring]] both fore and aft with no turret amidships. The armour scheme was also marginally improved over the ''Lion''s, with nine inches of armour on the turrets and {{convert|8|in|mm|0}} on the barbettes. The first ship in the class was built in Britain, and a further three constructed in Japan.<ref>Evans & Peattie, pp. 161\u201363</ref> The Japanese also re-classified their powerful armoured cruisers of the ''Tsukuba'' and ''Ibuki'' classes, carrying four 12-inch guns, as battlecruisers; nonetheless, their armament was weaker and they were slower than any battlecruiser.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 233</ref>\n\n[[File:Kongo Postcard.jpg|thumb|''Kong\u014d'']]\nThe next British battlecruiser, {{HMS|Tiger|1913|2}}, was intended initially as the fourth ship in the ''Lion'' class, but was substantially redesigned. She retained the eight 13.5-inch guns of her predecessors, but they were positioned like those of ''Kong\u014d'' for better fields of fire. She was faster (making {{convert|29|kn}} on [[sea trial]]s), and carried a heavier secondary armament. ''Tiger'' was also more heavily armoured on the whole; while the maximum thickness of armour was the same at nine inches, the height of the main armour belt was increased.<ref>Roberts, pp. 37\u201338</ref> Not all the desired improvements for this ship were approved, however. Her designer, [[Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, 1st Baronet|Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt]], had wanted small-bore [[water-tube boiler]]s and geared turbines to give her a speed of {{convert|32|kn}}, but he received no support from the authorities and the engine makers refused his request.<ref>Breyer, p. 136</ref>\n\n1912 saw work begin on three more German battlecruisers of the {{sclass-|Derfflinger|battlecruiser|4}}, the first German battlecruisers to mount 12-inch guns. These ships, like ''Tiger'' and the ''Kong\u014d''s, had their guns arranged in superfiring turrets for greater efficiency. Their armour and speed was similar to the previous ''Seydlitz'' class.<ref>Breyer, pp. 277\u201378</ref> In 1913, the [[Russian Empire]] also began the construction of the four-ship {{sclass-|Borodino|battlecruiser|4}}, which were designed for service in the [[Baltic Sea]]. These ships were designed to carry twelve 14-inch guns, with armour up to 12 inches thick, and a speed of {{convert|26.6|kn}}. The heavy armour and relatively slow speed of these ships made them more similar to German designs than to British ships; construction of the ''Borodino''s was halted by the First World War and all were scrapped after the end of the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref>Breyer, p. 399</ref>\n\n==World War I==\n\n===Construction===\nFor most of the combatants, capital ship construction was very limited during the war. Germany finished the ''Derfflinger'' class and began work on the {{sclass-|Mackensen|battlecruiser|4}}. The ''Mackensen''s were a development of the ''Derfflinger'' class, with 13.8-inch guns and a broadly similar armour scheme, designed for {{convert|28|kn}}.<ref>Breyer, pp. 283\u201384</ref>\n\nIn Britain, Jackie Fisher returned to the office of First Sea Lord in October 1914. His enthusiasm for big, fast ships was unabated, and he set designers to producing a design for a battlecruiser with 15-inch guns. Because Fisher expected the next German battlecruiser to steam at 28 knots, he required the new British design to be capable of 32 knots. He planned to reorder two {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship}}s, which had been approved but not yet laid down, to a new design. Fisher finally received approval for this project on 28 December 1914 and they became the {{sclass-|Renown|battlecruiser|4}}. With six [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch guns]] but only 6-inch armour they were a further step forward from ''Tiger'' in firepower and speed, but returned to the level of protection of the first British battlecruisers.<ref>Roberts, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Fisher resorted to subterfuge to obtain another three fast, lightly armoured ships that could use several spare {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0}} gun turrets left over from battleship construction. These ships were essentially light battlecruisers, and Fisher occasionally referred to them as such, but officially they were classified as ''large light cruisers''. This unusual designation was required because construction of new capital ships had been placed on hold, while there were no limits on [[light cruiser]] construction. They became {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and her sisters {{HMS|Glorious||2}} and {{HMS|Furious|47|2}}, and there was a bizarre imbalance between their main guns of 15 inches (or {{convert|18|in|0}} in ''Furious'') and their armour, which at {{convert|3|in|spell=in}} thickness was on the scale of a light cruiser. The design was generally regarded as a failure (nicknamed in the Fleet ''Outrageous'', ''Uproarious'' and ''Spurious''), though the later conversion of the ships to [[aircraft carrier]]s was very successful.<ref>Roberts, pp. 50\u201352</ref> Fisher also speculated about a new mammoth, but lightly built battlecruiser, that would carry {{convert|20|in|adj=on|0}} guns, which he termed {{HMS|Incomparable}}; this never got beyond the concept stage.<ref>Breyer, p. 172</ref>\n\nIt is often held that the ''Renown'' and ''Courageous'' classes were designed for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced [[draft (hull)|draught]], which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] under operational conditions. Roberts argues that the focus on the Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous [[Dardanelles Campaign]].<ref>Roberts, p. 51</ref>\n\nThe final British battlecruiser design of the war was the {{sclass2-|Admiral|battlecruiser|4}}, which was born from a requirement for an improved version of the ''Queen Elizabeth'' battleship. The project began at the end of 1915, after Fisher's final departure from the Admiralty. While initially envisaged as a battleship, senior sea officers felt that Britain had enough battleships, but that new battlecruisers might be required to combat German ships being built (the British overestimated German progress on the ''Mackensen'' class as well as their likely capabilities). A battlecruiser design with eight 15-inch guns, 8&nbsp;inches of armour and capable of 32 knots was decided on. The experience of battlecruisers at the [[Battle of Jutland]] meant that the design was radically revised and transformed again into a fast battleship with armour up to 12 inches thick, but still capable of {{convert|31.5|kn}}. The first ship in the class, {{HMS|Hood|51|2}}, was built according to this design to counter the possible completion of any of the Mackensen-class ship. The plans for her three sisters, on which little work had been done, were revised once more later in 1916 and in 1917 to improve protection.<ref>Roberts, pp. 55\u201361</ref>\n\nThe Admiral class would have been the only British ships capable of taking on the German ''Mackensen'' class; nevertheless, German shipbuilding was drastically slowed by the war, and while two ''Mackensen''s were launched, none were ever completed.<ref name=R601>Roberts, pp. 60\u201361</ref> The Germans also worked briefly on a further three ships, of the {{sclass-|Ersatz Yorck|battlecruiser|4}}, which were modified versions of the ''Mackensen''s with 15-inch guns.<ref>Gr\u00f6ner, pp. 58\u201359</ref> Work on the three additional Admirals was suspended in March 1917 to enable more escorts and merchant ships to be built to deal with the new threat from U-boats to trade. They were finally cancelled in February 1919.<ref name=R601/>\n\n===Battlecruisers in action===\nThe first combat involving battlecruisers during World War I was the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in August 1914. A force of British light cruisers and destroyers entered the [[Heligoland Bight]] (the part of the North Sea closest to [[Hamburg]]) to attack German destroyer patrols. When they met opposition from light cruisers, [[Vice Admiral]] [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]] took his squadron of five battlecruisers into the Bight and turned the tide of the battle, ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing their commander, [[Rear Admiral]] [[Leberecht Maass]].<ref>Burr, pp. 21\u201322</ref>\n\nThe German battlecruiser {{SMS|Goeben||2}} perhaps made the most impact early in the war. Stationed in the Mediterranean, she and the escorting light cruiser {{SMS|Breslau}} [[Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|evaded British and French ships on the outbreak of war]], and steamed to Constantinople ([[Istanbul]]) with two British battlecruisers in hot pursuit. The two German ships were handed over to the [[Ottoman Navy]], and this was instrumental in bringing the [[Ottoman Empire]] into the war as one of the [[Central Powers]]. ''Goeben'' herself, renamed ''Yavuz Sultan Selim'', fought engagements against the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the [[Black Sea]] before being knocked out of the action for the remainder of the war after the [[Battle of Imbros]] against British forces in the [[Aegean Sea]] in January 1918.<ref>Halpern, pp. 53\u201358; Staff, pp. 18\u201320</ref>\n\nThe original battlecruiser concept proved successful in December 1914 at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]. The British battlecruisers {{HMS|Inflexible|1907|2}} and {{HMS|Invincible|1907|2}} did precisely the job for which they were intended when they chased down and annihilated the [[German East Asia Squadron]], centered on the armoured cruisers {{SMS|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}}, along with three light cruisers, commanded by Admiral [[Maximilian von Spee|Maximilian Graf Von Spee]], in the South Atlantic Ocean. Prior to the battle, the Australian battlecruiser {{HMAS|Australia|1911|2}} had unsuccessfully searched for the German ships in the Pacific.<ref>Burr, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\n[[File:SMS Seydlitz2.jpg|thumb|{{SMS|Seydlitz||2}} was heavily damaged in the Battle of Dogger Bank]]\nDuring the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] in 1915, the aftermost barbette of the German flagship ''Seydlitz'' was struck by a British 13.5-inch shell from ''HMS Lion''. The shell did not penetrate the barbette, but it dislodged a piece of the barbette armour that allowed the flame from the shell's detonation to enter the barbette. The propellant charges being hoisted upwards were ignited, and the fireball flashed up into the turret and down into the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]], setting fire to charges removed from their brass cartridge cases. The gun crew tried to escape into the next turret, which allowed the flash to spread into that turret as well, killing the crews of both turrets. ''Seydlitz'' was saved from near-certain destruction only by emergency flooding of her after magazines, which had been effected by [[Wilhelm Heidkamp]]. This near-disaster was due to the way that ammunition handling was arranged and was common to both German and British battleships and battlecruisers, but the lighter protection on the latter made them more vulnerable to the turret or barbette being penetrated. The Germans learned from investigating the damaged ''Seydlitz'' and instituted measures to ensure that ammunition handling minimised any possible exposure to flash.<ref>Staff, pp. 23\u201324, 43</ref>\n\nApart from the [[cordite]] handling, the battle was mostly inconclusive, though both the British flagship ''Lion'' and ''Seydlitz'' were severely damaged. ''Lion'' lost speed, causing her to fall behind the rest of the battleline, and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships for the remainder of the engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty's squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser ''Bl\u00fccher'', sinking her with great loss of life. The British blamed their failure to win a decisive victory on their poor gunnery and attempted to increase their rate of fire by stockpiling unprotected cordite charges in their ammunition hoists and barbettes.<ref>Staff, pp. 43\u201344; Burr, pp. 24, 33</ref>\n\n[[File:Destruction of HMS Queen Mary.jpg|thumb|left|''Queen Mary'' blows up during the Battle of Jutland]]\nAt the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May 1916, both British and German battlecruisers were employed as fleet units. The British battlecruisers became engaged with both their German counterparts, the battlecruisers, and then German battleships before the arrival of the battleships of the [[British Grand Fleet]]. The result was a disaster for the Royal Navy's battlecruiser squadrons: ''Invincible'', ''Queen Mary'', and {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|2}} exploded with the loss of all but a handful of their crews.<ref>Halpern, pp. 318\u201321</ref> The exact reason why the ships' magazines detonated is not known, but the plethora of exposed cordite charges stored in their turrets, ammunition hoists and working chambers in the quest to increase their rate of fire undoubtedly contributed to their loss.<ref>Lambert 1998, pp. 54\u201355</ref> Beatty's flagship ''Lion'' herself was almost lost in a similar manner, save for the heroic actions of [[Major]] [[Francis John William Harvey|Francis Harvey]].<ref>Roberts, p. 116</ref>\n\nThe better-armoured German battlecruisers fared better, in part due to the poor performance of British fuzes (the British shells tended to explode or break up on impact with the German armour).<ref>Halpern, p. 328</ref> {{SMS|L\u00fctzow||2}}\u2014the only German battlecruiser lost at Jutland\u2014had only 128 killed,<ref>Staff, pp. 41\u201342</ref> for instance, despite receiving more than thirty hits. The other German battlecruisers, {{SMS|Moltke||2}}, ''Von der Tann'', ''Seydlitz'', and {{SMS|Derfflinger||2}}, were all heavily damaged and required extensive repairs after the battle, ''Seydlitz'' barely making it home, for they had been the focus of British fire for much of the battle.<ref>Halpern, pp. 319\u201325</ref>\n\n==Interwar period==\nIn the years immediately after World War I, Britain, Japan and the US all began design work on a new generation of ever more powerful battleships and battlecruisers. The new burst of shipbuilding that each nation's navy desired was politically controversial and potentially economically crippling. This nascent arms race was prevented by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922, where the major naval powers agreed to limits on capital ship numbers.<ref>Breyer, pp. 62\u201364, 70\u201372</ref> The German navy was not represented at the talks; under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany was not allowed any modern capital ships at all.<ref>Chesneau, p. 218</ref>\n\nThrough the 1920s and 1930s only Britain and Japan retained battlecruisers, often modified and rebuilt from their original designs. The line between the battlecruiser and the modern fast battleship became blurred; indeed, the Japanese ''Kong\u014d''s were formally redesignated as battleships after their very comprehensive reconstruction in the 1930s.<ref name=j5>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 35</ref>\n\n===Plans in the aftermath of World War I===\n''Hood'', launched in 1918, was the last World War I battlecruiser to be completed. Owing to lessons from Jutland, the ship was modified during construction; the thickness of her belt armour was increased by an average of 50 percent and extended substantially, she was given heavier deck armour, and the protection of her magazines was improved to guard against the ignition of ammunition. This was hoped to be capable of resisting her own weapons\u2014the classic measure of a \"balanced\" battleship. ''Hood'' was the largest ship in the Royal Navy when completed; thanks to her great displacement, in theory she combined the firepower and armour of a battleship with the speed of a battlecruiser, causing some to refer to her as a fast battleship. However her protection was markedly less than that of the British battleships built immediately after World War I, the {{sclass-|Nelson|battleship|4}}.<ref name=\"Breyer, p. 168\"/>\n\n[[File:Lexington class battlecruiser2.jpg|thumb|left|''Lexington''-class battlecruiser (painting, c. 1919)]]\nThe navies of Japan and the United States, not being affected immediately by the war, had time to develop new heavy {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} guns for their latest designs and to refine their battlecruiser designs in light of combat experience in Europe. The Imperial Japanese Navy began four {{sclass-|Amagi|battlecruiser|2}}s. These vessels would have been of unprecedented size and power, as fast and well armoured as ''Hood'' whilst carrying a main battery of ten 16-inch guns, the most powerful armament ever proposed for a battlecruiser. They were, for all intents and purposes, fast battleships\u2014the only differences between them and the {{sclass-|Tosa|battleship|2}}s which were to precede them were {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=off}} less side armour and a {{convert|.25|kn}} increase in speed.<ref>Breyer, p. 353</ref> The United States Navy, which had worked on its battlecruiser designs since 1913 and watched the latest developments in this class with great care, responded with the {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|4}}. If completed as planned, they would have been exceptionally fast and well armed with eight 16-inch guns, but carried armour little better than the ''Invincible''s\u2014this after an {{convert|8000|LT|t|adj=on}} increase in protection following Jutland.<ref>Breyer, p. 234</ref> The final stage in the post-war battlecruiser race came with the British response to the ''Amagi'' and ''Lexington'' types: four {{convert|48000|LT|t|adj=on}} [[G3 battlecruiser]]s. Royal Navy documents of the period often described any battleship with a speed of over about {{convert|24|kn}} as a battlecruiser, regardless of the amount of protective armour, although the G3 was considered by most to be a well-balanced fast battleship.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, pp. 41\u201342</ref>\n\nThe Washington Naval Treaty meant that none of these designs came to fruition. Ships that had been started were either broken up on the [[slipway]] or converted to aircraft carriers. In Japan, ''Amagi'' and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}} were selected for conversion. ''Amagi'' was damaged beyond repair by the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] and was broken up for [[ship breaking|scrap]]; the hull of one of the proposed ''Tosa''-class battleships, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2}}, was converted in her stead.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 235</ref> The United States Navy also converted two battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers in the wake of the Washington Treaty: {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, although this was only considered marginally preferable to scrapping the hulls outright (the remaining four: ''Constellation'', ''Ranger'', ''Constitution'' and ''United States'' were scrapped).<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 119</ref> In Britain, Fisher's \"large light cruisers,\" were converted to carriers. ''Furious'' had already been partially converted during the war and ''Glorious'' and ''Courageous'' were similarly converted.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 40</ref>\n\n===Rebuilding programmes===\n[[File:HMS Repulse (1919) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|350px|''Repulse'' as she was in 1919]]\n[[File:HMS Renown (1939) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|350px|''Renown'', as reconstructed, in 1939]]\n\nIn total, nine battlecruisers survived the Washington Naval Treaty, although HMS ''Tiger'' later became a victim of the [[London Naval Conference]] of 1930 and was scrapped.<ref>Burt, p. 48</ref> Because their high speed made them valuable surface units in spite of their weaknesses, most of these ships were significantly updated before World War II. {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} and {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}} were modernized significantly in the 1920s and 1930s. Between 1934 and 1936, ''Repulse'' was partially modernized and had her [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] modified, an aircraft [[hangar]], [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] and new gunnery equipment added and her anti-aircraft armament increased. ''Renown'' underwent a more thorough reconstruction between 1937 and 1939. Her deck armour was increased, new turbines and boilers were fitted, an aircraft hangar and catapult added and she was completely rearmed aside from the main guns which had their elevation increased to +30 degrees. The bridge structure was also removed and a large bridge similar to that used in the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|0}} battleships installed in its place. While conversions of this kind generally added weight to the vessel, ''Renown''{{'}}s tonnage actually decreased due to a substantially lighter power plant. Similar thorough rebuildings planned for ''Repulse'' and ''Hood'' were cancelled due to the advent of [[World War II]].<ref>Breyer, pp. 157\u201358, 172</ref>\n\nUnable to build new ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy also chose to improve its existing battlecruisers of the ''Kong\u014d'' class (initially the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}}, {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}, and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kong\u014d||2}}\u2014the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}} only later as it had been disarmed under the terms of the Washington treaty) in two substantial reconstructions (one for ''Hiei''). During the first of these, elevation of their main guns was increased to +40 degrees, [[anti-torpedo bulges]] and {{convert|3800|LT|t}} of horizontal armour added, and a \"pagoda\" mast with additional command positions built up. This reduced the ships' speed to {{convert|25.9|kn}}. The second reconstruction focused on speed as they had been selected as fast escorts for aircraft carrier task forces. Completely new main engines, a reduced number of boilers and an increase in hull length by {{convert|26|ft|m|1}} allowed them to reach up to 30 knots once again. They were reclassified as \"fast battleships,\" although their armour and guns still fell short compared to surviving World War I\u2013era battleships in the American or the British navies, with dire consequences during the [[Pacific War]], when ''Hiei'' and ''Kirishima'' were easily crippled by US gunfire during actions off Guadalcanal, forcing their scuttling shortly afterwards.<ref>Breyer, pp. 339\u201340</ref> Perhaps most tellingly, ''Hiei'' was crippled by medium-caliber gunfire from heavy and light cruisers in a close-range night engagement.<ref>Stille, pp. 19\u201320</ref>\n\nThere were two exceptions: Turkey's ''Yavuz Sultan Selim'' and the Royal Navy's ''Hood''. The Turkish Navy made only minor improvements to the ship in the interwar period, which primarily focused on repairing wartime damage and the installation of new fire control systems and anti-aircraft batteries.<ref>Chesneau, p. 406</ref> ''Hood'' was in constant service with the fleet and could not be withdrawn for an extended reconstruction. She received minor improvements over the course of the 1930s, including modern fire control systems, increased numbers of anti-aircraft guns, and in March 1941, radar.<ref>Konstam, pp. 33\u201334</ref>\n\n===Naval rearmament===\nIn the late 1930s navies began to build capital ships again, and during this period a number of large commerce raiders and small, fast battleships were built that are sometimes referred to as battlecruisers. Germany and Russia designed new battlecruisers during this period, though only the latter laid down two of the 35,000-ton {{sclass-|Kronshtadt|battlecruiser|4}}. They were still on the slipways when the Germans invaded in 1941 and construction was suspended. Both ships were scrapped after the war.<ref>McLaughlin 2004, pp. 112, 114</ref>\n\nThe Germans planned three battlecruisers of the {{sclass2-|O|battlecruiser|4}} as part of the expansion of the [[Kriegsmarine]] ([[Plan Z]]). With six 15-inch guns, high speed, excellent range, but very thin armour, they were intended as commerce raiders. Only one was ordered shortly before World War II; no work was ever done on it. No names were assigned, and they were known by their contract names: 'O', 'P', and 'Q'. The new class was not universally welcomed in the Kriegsmarine. Their abnormally-light protection gained it the derogatory nickname ''Ohne Panzer Quatsch'' (without armour nonsense) within certain circles of the Navy.<ref>Garzke & Dulin, pp. 353\u201354, 363; Gr\u00f6ner, p. 68</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n{{See also| List of battlecruisers of the Second World War}}\nThe Royal Navy deployed some of its battlecruisers during the [[Norwegian Campaign]] in April 1940. The {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} were engaged during the [[Action off Lofoten]] by ''Renown'' in very bad weather and disengaged after ''Gneisenau'' was damaged. One of ''Renown''{{'}}s 15-inch shells passed through ''Gneisenau''{{'}}s [[List of British ordnance terms#DCT|director-control tower]] without exploding, severing electrical and communication cables as it went and destroyed the [[rangefinders]] for the forward 150&nbsp;mm (5.9&nbsp;in) turrets. Main-battery fire control had to be shifted aft due to the loss of electrical power. Another shell from ''Renown'' knocked out ''Gneisenau''{{'}}s aft turret.<ref>Garzke & Dulin, pp. 135\u201336</ref> The British ship was struck twice by German shells that failed to inflict any significant damage.<ref>Burt, p. 243</ref> She was the only pre-war battlecruiser to survive the war.<ref>Chesneau, pp. 9, 173</ref>\n\nIn the early years of the war various German ships had a measure of success hunting merchant ships in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Allied battlecruisers such as ''Renown'', ''Repulse'', and the fast battleships ''Dunkerque'' and {{ship|French battleship|Strasbourg||2}} were employed on operations to hunt down the commerce-raiding German ships. The one stand-up fight occurred when the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} [[sortie]]d into the North Atlantic to attack British shipping and were intercepted by ''Hood'' and the battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} in May 1941 in the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]]. The elderly British battlecruiser was no match for the modern German battleship: within minutes, the ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 15-inch shells caused a magazine explosion in ''Hood'' reminiscent of the Battle of Jutland. Only three men survived.<ref>Whitley 1998, p. 127</ref>\n\nThe first battlecruiser to see action in the Pacific War was ''Repulse'' when [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|she was sunk]] by Japanese [[torpedo bomber]]s north of [[Singapore]] on 10 December 1941 whilst in company with ''Prince of Wales''. She was lightly damaged by a single {{convert|250|kg|adj=on}} bomb and near-missed by two others in the first Japanese attack. Her speed and agility enabled her to avoid the other attacks by level bombers and dodge 33 torpedoes. The last group of torpedo bombers attacked from multiple directions and ''Repulse'' was struck by five torpedoes. She quickly [[capsized]] with the loss of 27 officers and 486 crewmen; 42 officers and 754 enlisted men were rescued by the escorting destroyers.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa, pp. 116\u201321, 123</ref> The loss of ''Repulse'' and ''Prince of Wales'' conclusively proved the vulnerability of capital ships to aircraft without air cover of their own.<ref>Osborne, pp. 127\u201328</ref>\n\nThe Japanese ''Kong\u014d''-class battlecruisers were extensively used as carrier escorts for most of their wartime career due to their high speed. Their World War I\u2013era armament was weaker and their upgraded armour was still thin compared to contemporary battleships. On 13 November 1942, during the [[First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], ''Hiei'' stumbled across American cruisers and destroyers at [[point-blank range]]. The ship was badly damaged in the encounter and had to be towed by her [[sister ship]] ''Kirishima''. Both were spotted by American aircraft the following morning and ''Kirishima'' was forced to cast off her tow because of repeated aerial attacks. ''Hiei''{{'}}s captain ordered her crew to abandon ship after further damage and [[scuttled]] ''Hiei'' in the early evening of 14 November.<ref name=hiei>{{Cite web |url= http://www.combinedfleet.com/hiei2.htm |title=IJN Hiei: Tabular Record of Movement |last1=Hackett |first1=Bob |last2=Kingsepp |first2=Sander |last3=Ahlberg |first3=Lars |year=2010 |publisher=Combinedfleet.com |accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> On the night of 14/15 November during the [[Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], ''Kirishima'' returned to [[Ironbottom Sound]], but encountered the American battleships {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}}. While failing to detect ''Washington'', ''Kirishima'' engaged ''South Dakota'' with some effect. ''Washington'' opened fire a few minutes later at short range and badly damaged ''Kirishima'', knocking out her aft turrets, jamming her rudder, and hitting the ship below the waterline.

Described by some as battlecruisers, but never classified as capital ships, they were variously described as \"super cruisers\", \"large cruisers\" or even \"unrestricted cruisers\". The Dutch, American, and Japanese navies all planned these new classes specifically to counter the heavy cruisers, or their counterparts, being built by their naval rivals.<ref>Chesneau, p. 388; Garzke & Dulin, p. 86; Friedman 1984, p. 288; McLaughlin 2006, p. 104</ref>\n\nThe first such battlecruisers were the Dutch [[Design 1047 battlecruiser|Design 1047]], designed to protect their colonies in the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]] in the face of Japanese aggression. Never officially assigned names, these ships were designed with German and Italian assistance. While they broadly resembled the German ''Scharnhorst'' class and had the same main battery, they would have been more lightly armoured and only protected against eight-inch gunfire. Although the design was mostly completed, work on the vessels never commenced as the Germans overran the Netherlands in May 1940. The first ship would have been laid down in June of that year.<ref>Noot, pp. 243, 249, 268</ref>\n\nThe only class of these late battlecruisers actually built were the United States Navy's {{sclass-|Alaska|cruiser|0}} \"large cruisers\". Two of them were completed, {{USS|Alaska|CB-1|2}} and {{USS|Guam|CB-2|2}}; a third, {{USS|Hawaii|CB-3|2}}, was cancelled while under construction and three others, to be named ''Philippines'', ''Puerto Rico'' and ''Samoa'', were cancelled before they were laid down. They were classified as \"large cruisers\" instead of battlecruisers, and their status as non-capital ships evidenced by their being named for territories or protectorates. (Battleships, in contrast, were named after states and cruisers after cities.) With a main armament of nine 12-inch guns in three triple turrets and a displacement of {{convert|27000|LT|t}}, the ''Alaska''s were twice the size of {{sclass-|Baltimore|cruiser|2}}s and had guns some 50% larger in diameter. They lacked the thick armoured belt and intricate torpedo defence system of true capital ships. However, unlike most battlecruisers, they were considered a balanced design according to cruiser standards as their protection could withstand fire from their own caliber of gun, albeit only in a very narrow range band. They were designed to hunt down Japanese heavy cruisers, though by the time they entered service most Japanese cruisers had been sunk by American aircraft or submarines.<ref>Friedman 1984, pp. 288\u201389, 296, 301\u201302</ref> Like the contemporary {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|0}} fast battleships, their speed ultimately made them more useful as carrier escorts and bombardment ships than as the surface combatants they were developed to be.<ref>Whitley 1995, pp. 278\u201379</ref>\n\nThe Japanese started designing the B64 class, which was similar to the ''Alaska'' but with {{convert|310|mm|1|adj=on}} guns. News of the ''Alaska''s led them to upgrade the design, creating [[Design B-65 cruiser|Design B-65]]. Armed with 356&nbsp;mm guns, the B65s would have been the best armed of the new breed of battlecruisers, but they still would have had only sufficient protection to keep out eight-inch shells. Much like the Dutch, the Japanese got as far as completing the design for the B65s, but never laid them down. By the time the designs were ready the Japanese Navy recognized that they had little use for the vessels and that their priority for construction should lie with aircraft carriers. Like the ''Alaska''s, the Japanese did not call these ships battlecruisers, referring to them instead as super-heavy cruisers.<ref>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 40; Garzke & Dulin, pp. 86\u201387</ref>\n\n==Cold War\u2013era designs==\n[[File:Kirov-class battlecruiser.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Admiral Lazarev'', formerly ''Frunze'', the second ship of her class]]\nIn spite of the fact that most navies abandoned the battleship and battlecruiser concepts after World War II, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s fondness for big-gun-armed warships caused the Soviet Union to plan a large cruiser class in the late 1940s. In the [[Soviet Union]] they were termed \"heavy cruisers\" (''tjazholyj krejser'').<ref>McLaughlin 2006, p. 104</ref> The fruits of this program were the [[Stalingrad-class battlecruiser|Project 82 (''Stalingrad'')]] cruisers, of {{convert|36500|t|LT}} standard load, nine 305&nbsp;mm guns and a speed of {{convert|35|kn}}. Three ships were laid down in 1951\u20131952, but they were cancelled in April 1953 after Stalin's death.

He is the longest-serving Labor Party Prime Minister.\n\nHawke was born in [[South Australia]] but moved to [[Western Australia]] as a child. He attended the [[University of Western Australia]] and then went on to [[Oxford University]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]]. In 1956, Hawke joined the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] (ACTU) as a research officer. Having risen to become responsible for wage arbitration, he was elected [[Australian Council of Trade Unions|ACTU President]] in 1969, where he achieved a high public profile. After a decade in that role, Hawke announced his intention to enter politics, and was immediately elected to the [[Parliament of Australia|House of Representatives]] as the Labor MP for [[Division of Wills|Wills]].\n\nThree years later, he led Labor to a landslide election victory at the [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983 election]] and was sworn in as Prime Minister. He led Labor to victory three more times, in [[Australian federal election, 1984|1984]], [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987]] and [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990]], making him the most electorally successful Labor Leader. The [[Hawke Government]] created [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] and [[Landcare Australia|Landcare]], brokered the [[Prices and Incomes Accord]], established [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], floated the Australian dollar, deregulated the financial sector, introduced the [[Family allowance#Australia|Family Assistance Scheme]], announced \"[[Advance Australia Fair]]\" as the official national anthem, initiated [[Superannuation in Australia|superannuation pension schemes]] for all workers and oversaw passage of the [[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act]] that removed all remaining jurisdiction by the [[United Kingdom]] from Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australia Act (Commencement) Order 1986|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/319/pdfs/uksi_19860319_en.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nHawke was [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, December 1991|replaced]] by his deputy [[Paul Keating]] at the end of 1991.

Hawke is the only Australian Prime Minister to be born in South Australia, and the only one raised and educated in Western Australia.\n\n==Early life and family==\nHawke was born in [[Bordertown, South Australia]], the second child of [[Clem Hawke|Arthur Hawke]] (1898\u20131989) (known as Clem), a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] minister, and his wife Edith Emily (Lee) (1897\u20131979)<ref>https://www.geni.com/people/Edith-Hawke/6000000016769309589</ref><ref>https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lee-9637</ref> (known as Ellie), a schoolteacher.<ref>{{citation|last=D'Alpuget|first= Blanche|date=1982|title=Robert J.

Ellie Hawke subsequently developed an almost messianic belief in her son's destiny, and this contributed to Hawke's supreme self-confidence throughout his career.<ref>Davidson, G., ''et al.''

He concerned himself with making improvements to workers' lives from within the traditional institutions of government, rather than by using any ideological theory. He opposed the [[Vietnam War]], but was a strong supporter of the US-Australian alliance, and also an emotional supporter of [[Israel]]. It was his commitment to the cause of Jewish [[Refuseniks]] which purportedly led to a planned assassination attempt on Hawke by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], and its Australian operative [[Munif Mohammed Abou Rish]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/palestinian-plot-to-kill-hawke/2006/12/31/1167500010729.html|title=Terrorists plotted Hawke assassination: ASIO|publisher=Theage.com.au |date=31 December 2006|accessdate=25 April 2010 | location=Melbourne|first=Brendan|last=Nicholson}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Hawke along with other members of the ACTU requested that South Africa send a non-racially biased team for the [[1971 South Africa rugby union tour of Australia|Rugby Union tour]], with the intention of unions agreeing not to serve the team in Australia. Prior to arrival, the Western Australian branch of the [[Transport Workers Union of Australia|Transport Workers Union]], and the Barmaids' and Barmens' Union, announced that they would serve the team, which allowed the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] to land in Perth. The tour commenced on 26 June and riots occurred as anti-apartheid protesters disrupted games. Hawke and his family started to receive malicious mail and phone calls from people who thought that sport and politics should not mix. Hawke remained committed to the ban on apartheid teams and later that year, the South African cricket team was successfully denied and no apartheid team was to ever come to Australia again. It was this ongoing dedication to racial equality in South Africa that would later earn Hawke the respect and friendship of [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref>D'Alpuget, Blanche (1982). ''Robert .J.

As early as 1972, speculation began that he would seek to enter [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] and eventually run to become the [[Australian Labor Party|Leader of the Labor Party]]. But while his professional career continued successfully, his heavy drinking and his notorious womanising placed considerable strains on his family life.<ref>Davidson, G., et al. (1998), p. 303</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Hawke was elected as the [[Australian Labor Party|Federal President of the Labor Party]]. Two years later, when the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam Government]] was controversially [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|dismissed by the Governor-General]], Hawke showed an initial keenness to enter Parliament at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|ensuing election]]. [[Harry Jenkins, Sr.|Harry Jenkins]], the MP for [[Division of Scullin|Scullin]], came under pressure to step down to allow Hawke to stand in his place, but he strongly resisted this push.<ref>Obituary \"Labor stalwart who would not stand aside for Bob Hawke\", ''The Age'', 6 August 2004, p.9</ref> Hawke eventually decided not to attempt to enter Parliament at that time, a decision he soon regretted. After Labor was defeated at the election, Whitlam initially offered the leadership to Hawke, although it was not within Whitlam's power to decide who would succeed him.<ref>Hawke (1994), p.70</ref> Despite not taking on the offer, Hawke remained influential, playing a key role in averting national strike action.<ref>Hurst, J., (1983), p. 198</ref>\n\nThe strain of this period, serving as both ACTU President and Labor Party President, took its toll on Hawke and in 1979 he suffered a physical collapse. This shock led Hawke to publicly announce his alcoholism in a television interview, and that he would make a concerted \u2013 and ultimately successful \u2013 effort to overcome it. He was helped through this period by the relationship that he had established with writer [[Blanche d'Alpuget]], who, in 1982, published a biography of Hawke. His popularity with the public was, if anything, enhanced by this period of rehabilitation, and opinion polling suggested that he was a far more popular public figure than either Labor Leader [[Bill Hayden]] or [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Member of Parliament==\n[[File:Bob Hawke in 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|Hawke addresses the Labour Day crowd in October 1980]]\nHawke's first attempt to enter Parliament came during the [[Australian federal election, 1963|1963 federal election]]. He stood in the seat of [[Division of Corio|Corio]] in [[Geelong]] and managed to achieve a 3.1% swing against the national trend, although he fell short of ousting longtime Liberal incumbent [[Hubert Opperman]].<ref>[http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1963/1963repsvic.txt]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010223600/http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1963/1963repsvic.txt|date=10 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nHawke passed up several opportunities to enter Parliament throughout the 1970s, something he later wrote that he \"regretted\". He eventually stood for election to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1980|1980 election]] for the safe [[Melbourne]] seat of [[Division of Wills|Wills]], winning it comfortably. Immediately upon his election to Parliament, Hawke was appointed to the [[Shadow Cabinet]] by Labor Leader [[Bill Hayden]] as Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations.<ref>Hurst, J., (1983), p. 262</ref> Following his entry to Parliament, opinion polls continually indicated that, in contrast to Hayden, Hawke was regarded as \"a certain election winner\". \n\nHayden, after having lost (albeit narrowly) the 1980 election, was increasingly subject to criticism from ALP figures concerning his leadership. In order to quell speculation over his position, Hayden eventually called a leadership ballot for 16 July 1982, believing that if he won he would be able to lead Labor into the next election.<ref>Kelly, P., (1992), p. 24</ref> Hawke duly challenged Hayden, but Hayden was able to defeat him and remain in position, although his five-vote victory over the former ACTU President was not large enough to dispel doubts that he could lead the Labor Party to victory at an election.<ref>Hurst, J., (1983), p. 269</ref>\n\nDespite being defeated, Hawke continued to agitate behind the scenes for a change in leadership, with opinion polls continuing to show that Hawke was a far more popular figure than both Hayden and Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]]. Hayden was further weakened after the ALP's unexpectedly poor performance at a by-election in December 1982 for the Victorian seat of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]], following the resignation of the former Liberal Minister [[Phillip Lynch|Sir Phillip Lynch]]. Labor needed a swing of 5.5% to win the seat, and had been predicted by the media to win, but could only achieve a swing of 3%.<ref name=autogenerated3>Hurst, J., (1983), p. 270</ref> This convinced many Labor MPs that only Hawke would be able to lead Labor to victory at the upcoming election. \n\nLabor Party power-brokers, such as [[Graham Richardson]] and [[Barrie Unsworth]], now openly switched their allegiance from Hayden to Hawke.<ref name=autogenerated3/> More significantly, Hayden's staunch friend and political ally, Labor's [[Australian Senate|Senate Leader]] [[John Button]], had become convinced that Hawke's chances of victory at an election were greater than Hayden's. Initially Hayden believed that he could remain in his job, but Button's defection proved to be the final straw in convincing Hayden that he would have to resign as Labor Leader.<ref name=\"Hurst, J., 1983, p. 273\">Hurst, J., (1983), p. 273</ref>\n\nLess than two months after the disastrous result at the Flinders by-election, Hayden announced his resignation as Leader of the Labor Party to the caucus on 3 February 1983. Hawke was subsequently named as leader\u2014and hence became [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]]\u2014pending a party-room ballot at which he was elected unopposed.<ref name=\"Hurst, J., 1983, p. 273\"/> Having learned about the impending change, on the same day Fraser called a [[Australian federal election, 1983|snap election]] for 5 March 1983, hoping to capitalise on Labor's feuding before it could replace Hayden with Hawke.<ref>Hurst, J., (1983), p. 275</ref> However, he was unable to have the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] confirm the election before Labor announced the change. In the election held a month later, Hawke led Labor to a landslide election victory, achieving a 24-seat swing\u2014still the worst defeat that a sitting non-Labor Government has ever suffered\u2014and ending seven years of Liberal Party rule.\n\n==Prime Minister (1983-1991)==\n{{Main article|Hawke Government}}\n===Early days===\n[[File:BannonHawke.jpg|right|thumb|Hawke presenting a relief cheque to [[John Bannon]], [[Premier of South Australia]], in April 1983, in the aftermath of the [[Ash Wednesday fires]].]]\nAfter Labor's landslide victory, Hawke was sworn in as the [[Prime Minister of Australia|23rd Prime Minister of Australia]] by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] on 11 March 1983. The inaugural days of the [[Hawke Government]] were distinctly different from those of the [[Whitlam Government]]. Rather than immediately initiating extensive reform programmes as Whitlam had, Hawke announced that [[Malcolm Fraser]]'s pre-election concealment of the budget deficit meant that many of Labor's election commitments would have to be deferred.<ref name=\"Kelly, P., 1992, p.57\">Kelly, P., (1992), p.57</ref> As part of his internal reforms package, Hawke divided the Government into two tiers, with only the most senior ministers sitting in the [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]]. The Labor caucus was still given the authority to determine who would make up the Ministry, but gave Hawke unprecedented powers for a Labor Prime Minister to select which individual ministers would comprise the 13-strong Cabinet.<ref name=autogenerated4>Kelly, P., (1992), p. 30</ref>\n\nHawke said that he did this in order to avoid what he viewed as the unwieldy nature of the Whitlam Cabinet, which had 27 members. Caucus under Hawke also exhibited a much more formalised system of parliamentary [[political faction|factions]], which significantly altered the dynamics of caucus operations.<ref name=autogenerated4/>\nUnlike his predecessor, Hawke's authority within the Labor Party was absolute. This enabled him to persuade his MPs to support a substantial set of policy changes. Individual accounts from ministers indicate that while Hawke was not usually the driving force behind individual reforms, he took on the role of achieving consensus and providing political guidance on what was electorally feasible and how best to sell it to the public, tasks at which he proved highly successful. Hawke took on a very public role as Prime Minister, proving to be incredibly popular with the Australian electorate; to this date he still holds the highest ever AC Nielsen approval rating.<ref>{{cite news|title=The biggest hammering in history|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/05/19/1211182705614.html |work= Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 May 2008|accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\n[[File:Hawke Reagan1985.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Hawke and US President [[Ronald Reagan]] at the [[White House]] in November 1984]]\nAccording to political commentator [[Paul Kelly (journalist)|Paul Kelly]], \"the most influential economic decisions of the 1980s were the floating of the Australian dollar and the deregulation of the financial system\".<ref name=autogenerated5>Kelly, P., (1992), p.76</ref> Although the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser Government]] had played a part in the process of financial deregulation by commissioning the 1981 Campbell Report, opposition from Fraser himself had stalled the deregulation process.<ref>Kelly, P., (1992), p.78</ref> When the Hawke Government implemented a comprehensive program of financial deregulation and reform, it \"transformed economics and politics in Australia\".

As well as the reintroduction of [[Medibank]], under the new name [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], these included the doubling of the number of childcare places, the introduction of occupational superannuation, a boost in school retention rates, a focus on young people's job skills, a doubling of subsidised homecare services, the elimination of poverty traps in the welfare system, a 50% increase in public housing funds, an increase in the real value of the old-age pension, the development of a new youth support program, the reintroduction of six-monthly indexation of single-person unemployment benefits, and significant improvements in social security provisions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Whitlam, Wran and the Labor tradition: Labor history essays, volume two By Gough Whitlam, Australian Labor Party, New South Wales Branch</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://john.curtin.edu.au/jcmemlect/wran1986.html |title=Wran/1986 The Great Tradition-Labor Reform from Curtin to Hawke |publisher=John.curtin.edu.au |date= |accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> \n\nAs pointed out by John Dawkins, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans was significantly higher under the Hawke Government than under the Whitlam Government.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In 1989, the [[Hawke Government|Hawke Labor Government]] gradually re-introducing fees for university study.

Under the original HECS, a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students, and the Commonwealth paid the balance. A student could defer payment of this HECS amount (in which case it was called a HECS debt) and repay the debt through the tax system, when the student's income exceeds a threshold level. As part of the reforms, Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means. The HECS system was accepted by both federal political parties and has survived until today, though with a number of changes.\n\nAnother notable success for which Hawke's response is given considerable credit was [[HIV/AIDS in Australia|Australia's public health campaign]] regarding HIV/AIDS.<ref>For discussion see William Bowtell, ''Australia's Response to HIV/AIDS 1982\u20132005'', Lowy Institute for International Policy, May 2005</ref> In the later years of the Hawke Government, Aboriginal affairs also saw considerable attention, with an investigation of the idea of a treaty between Aborigines and the Government, although this idea would be overtaken by events, notably the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)|Mabo court decision]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe Hawke Government also made some notable environmental decisions. In its first months in office, it halted the construction of the [[Franklin Dam]] in [[Tasmania]], responding to a groundswell of protest about the issue.<ref>Kelly, P., (1992), p. 528</ref> In 1990, with an election looming, tough political operator [[Graham Richardson]] was appointed Environment Minister, and was given the task of attracting second-preference votes from the [[Australian Democrats]] and other environmental parties. Richardson claimed this as a major factor in the government's narrow re-election at the [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990 election]].<ref>Richardson, G., (1994), pp. 276\u201377</ref> Richardson felt that the importance of his contribution to Labor's victory would automatically entitle him to the ministerial portfolio of his choice, which was Transport and Communications.<ref>Richardson, G., (1994), p. 281</ref> He was shocked, however, at what he perceived as Hawke's ingratitude in allocating him Social Security instead.

The Liberals were divided between supporters of the dour, socially conservative [[John Howard]] and the more liberal, urbane [[Andrew Peacock]]. The arch-conservative [[Premier of Queensland]], [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]], added to the Liberals' problems with his \"[[Joh for Canberra]]\" campaign, which proved highly damaging. Exploiting these divisions, Hawke led the Labor Party to landslide election victories in a snap [[Australian federal election, 1984|1984 election]] and the [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987 election]].\n\nHawke's tenure as Prime Minister saw considerable friction develop between himself and the grassroots of the Labor Party, who were unhappy at what they viewed as Hawke's iconoclasm and willingness to cooperate with business interests. All Labor Prime Ministers have at times engendered the hostility of the organisational wing of the Party, but none more so than Hawke, who regularly expressed his willingness to cull Labor's \"sacred cows\". The [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]] faction, as well as prominent Labor figure [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]], offered severe criticism of a number of government decisions. He also received criticism for his \"confrontationalist style\" in siding with the airlines in the [[1989 Australian pilots' strike]].<ref>Kelly, P., (1992), p.544</ref>\n\n===1990 election and leadership tensions===\nThe [[late 1980s recession]] and accompanying high interest rates had seen the government in considerable polling trouble, with many doubting if Hawke could win in 1990. Although Keating was the main architect of the government's economic policies, he took advantage of Hawke's declining popularity to plan a leadership challenge. In 1988, in the wake of poorer opinion polls, Keating put pressure on Hawke to step down immediately. Hawke responded by agreeing a secret deal with Keating, the so-called \"[[Kirribilli Agreement of 1988|Kirribilli agreement]]\", that he would stand down in Keating's favour shortly after the 1990 election, which he convinced Keating he could win.<ref>Kelly, P., (1992), p.454</ref> Hawke duly won the 1990 election, albeit by a very tight margin, and subsequently appointed Keating as [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]] to replace the retiring [[Lionel Bowen]], and to prepare Keating to assume the leadership.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nNot long after becoming Deputy Prime Minister, frustrated at the lack of any indication from Hawke as to when he might step down, Keating made a provocative speech to the [[Canberra Press Gallery|Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery]]. Hawke considered the speech extremely disloyal, and subsequently indicated to Keating that he would renege on the Kirribilli Agreement as a result.<ref>Hawke (1994), p.501. This was the speech in which Keating described himself as the 'Pl\u00e1cido Domingo' of Australian politics.</ref> After this disagreement, tensions between the two men reached an all-time high, and after a turbulent year, Keating finally resigned as Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer in June 1991, to challenge Hawke for the leadership.<ref>{{cite news |title=True rivals |author=Gordon, Michael |date=16 July 2010 |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/true-rivals-20100715-10cpx.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=11 March 2018 }}</ref> Hawke comfortably defeated Keating, and in a press conference after the result Keating declared that with regards the leadership, he had fired his \"one shot\".

He subsequently tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to the Governor-General.

Elmer Boyd Smith.]]\n'''Baldr''' (also '''Balder''', '''Baldur''') is a [[\u00c6sir|god]] in [[Norse mythology]], and a son of the god [[Odin]] and the goddess [[Frigg]]. He has [[Sons of Odin|numerous brothers]], such as [[Thor]] and [[V\u00e1li]].\n\nIn the 12th century, Danish accounts by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and other Danish Latin chroniclers recorded a [[Euhemerism|euhemerized]] account of his story. Compiled in [[Iceland]] in the 13th century, but based on much older [[Old Norse poetry]], the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' contain numerous references to the death of Baldr as both a great tragedy to the [[\u00c6sir]] and a harbinger of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].\n\nAccording to ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', a book of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Prose Edda, Baldr's wife is [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]] and their son is [[Forseti]]. In ''Gylfaginning'', Snorri relates that Baldr had the greatest ship ever built, named [[Hringhorni]], and that there is no place more beautiful than his hall, [[Breidablik]].\n\n==Name==\n[[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology]]'' (ch. 11) identifies Old Norse ''Baldr'' with the Old High German ''Baldere'' (2nd [[Merseburg Incantations|Merseburg Charm]], Thuringia), ''Palter'' (theonym, Bavaria), ''Paltar'' (personal name) and with Old English ''bealdor, baldor'' \"lord, prince, king\" (used always with a genitive plural, as in ''gumena baldor'' \"lord of men\", ''wigena baldor'' \"lord of warriors\", et cetera). Old Norse shows this usage of the word as an honorific in a few cases, as in ''baldur \u00ee brynju'' ([[Saemundar Edda|S\u00e6m.]] 272b) and ''herbaldr'' (S\u00e6m. 218b), both epithets of heroes in general.\n\nGrimm traces the etymology of the name to *''bal\u00feaz'', whence Gothic ''bal\u00fes'', Old English ''bald'', Old High German ''pald'', all meaning \"bold, brave\".<ref>\"''Baldrs'' would in strictness appear to have no connexion with the Goth. ''bal\u00fes'' (bold, audax), nor ''Paltar'' with the OHG. ''pald'', nor ''Baldr'' with the ON. ''ballr'' 'dangerous, dire'. As a rule, the Gothic ''ld'' is represented by ON. ''ld'' and OHG. ''lt'': the Gothic ''l\u00fe'' by ON. ''ll'' and OHG. ''ld''. But the OS. and AS. have ''ld'' in both cases, and even in Gothic, ON. and OHG. a root will sometimes appear in both forms in the same language;  so that a close connexion between ''bal\u00fes'' and ''Baldrs'', ''pald'' and Paltar, is possible after all.\"</ref>\n\nBut the interpretation of Baldr as \"the brave god\" may be secondary. Baltic (cf. Lithuanian ''[[:wikt:baltas|baltas]]'', Latvian ''[[:wikt:balts|balts]]'') has a word meaning \"the white, the good\", and Grimm speculates that the name may originate as a Baltic loan into [[Proto-Germanic]].\nIn continental Saxon and Anglo-Saxon tradition, the son of [[Odin|Woden]] is called not ''Bealdor'' but ''Baldag'' (Saxon) and ''[[Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies#Wessex and Bernicia|B\u00e6ld\u00e6g, Beldeg]]'' (Anglo-Saxon), which shows association with \"day\", possibly with [[Dagr|Day]] personified as a deity. This, as Grimm points out, would agree with the meaning \"shining one, white one, a god\" derived from the meaning of Baltic ''baltas'', further adducing Slavic ''[[Belobog]]'' and German ''[[Berhta]]''.<ref>\"''B\u00e6l-d\u00e6g'' itself is white-god, light-god, he that shines as sky and light and day, the kindly ''Bi\u00e8lb\u00f4gh, B\u00e8lb\u00f4gh'' of the Slav system. It is in perfect accord with this explanation of ''B\u00e6l-d\u00e6g'', that the Anglo-Saxon tale of ancestry assigns to him a son Brond, of whom the Edda is silent, ''brond, brand'', ON. ''brandr'' (fire brand or blade of a sword), signifying ''jubar, fax, titio''. B\u00e6ld\u00e6g therefore, as regards his name, would agree with ''Berhta'', the bright goddess.</ref>\n\nGrimm's etymology is endorsed by modern research.

Among the visions which the [[V\u00f6lva]] sees and describes in the prophecy known as the ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'' is one of the fatal [[mistletoe]], the birth of [[V\u00e1li (son of Odin)|V\u00e1li]] and the weeping of [[Frigg]] (stanzas 31\u201333).  Yet looking far into the future the V\u00f6lva sees a brighter vision of a new world, when both H\u00f6\u00f0r and Baldr will come back (stanza 62). The Eddic poem ''[[Baldr's Dreams]]'' mentions that Baldr has bad dreams which the gods then discuss. [[Odin]] rides to Hel and awakens a seeress, who tells him H\u00f6\u00f0r will kill Baldr but Vali will avenge him (stanzas 9, 11).\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\n[[Image:S\u00c1M 66, 75v, death of Baldr.jpg|thumb|right|Baldr's death is portrayed in this illustration from an 18th-century [[Iceland]]ic manuscript.]]\n\nIn ''Gylfaginning'', Baldur is described as follows:\n\n{|\n|\n:''Annar sonur \u00d3\u00f0ins er Baldur, og er fr\u00e1 honum gott a\u00f0 segja.

He hurried to the place where the gods were indulging in their new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki gave the spear to Baldr's brother, the blind god [[H\u00f6\u00f0r]], who then inadvertently killed his brother with it (other versions suggest that Loki guided the arrow himself).

As he was carried to the ship, Odin whispered in his ear. This was to be a key riddle asked by Odin (in disguise) of the giant [[Vafthrudnir]] (and which was unanswerable) in the poem ''[[Vafthrudnismal]]''. The riddle also appears in the riddles of [[Gestumblindi]] in ''[[Hervarar saga]]''.<ref>According to Carolyne Larrington in her translation of the ''Poetic Edda'' it is assumed that what Odin whispered in Baldr's ear was a promise of resurrection.</ref>\n\nThe dwarf [[Litr]] was kicked by [[Thor]] into the funeral fire and burnt alive. Nanna, Baldr's wife, also threw herself on the funeral fire to await Ragnar\u00f6k when she would be reunited with her husband (alternatively, she died of grief). Baldr's horse with all its trappings was also burned on the pyre. The ship was set to sea by [[Hyrrokin]], a [[giantess]], who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.\n\nUpon Frigg's entreaties, delivered through the messenger [[Herm\u00f3\u00f0r|Hermod]], [[Hel (goddess)|Hel]] promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. All did, except a [[giantess]], [[\u00de\u00f6kk]] (often presumed to be the god [[Loki]] in disguise), who refused to mourn the slain god. Thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnar\u00f6k, when he and his brother H\u00f6\u00f0r would be reconciled and rule the new earth together with Thor's sons.\n\n===''Gesta Danorum''===\n[[File:Baldur by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|200px| ''Baldur'' by [[Johannes Gehrts]].]]\n\nWriting at about the end of the 12th century, the [[Denmark|Danish]] historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] tells the story of Baldr (recorded as ''Balderus'') in a form which professes to be historical.  According to him, Balderus and H\u00f8therus were rival suitors for the hand of Nanna, daughter of Gewar, King of [[Norway]]. Balderus was a demigod and common [[steel]] could not wound his sacred body. The two rivals encountered each other in a terrific battle. Though Odin and Thor and the other gods fought for Balderus, he was defeated and fled away, and H\u00f8therus married the princess.\n\nNevertheless Balderus took heart of grace and again met H\u00f8therus in a stricken field. But he fared even worse than before. H\u00f8therus dealt him a deadly wound with a [[magic sword]], named [[Mistilteinn|Mistletoe]],<ref>[[Hilda Ellis Davidson|Davidson, H.R. Ellis]] (1964).

Hother first slew Othen's (i.e. Odin) son Balder in battle and then chased Othen and Thor. Finally, Othen's son Both killed Hother.

He gained the hatred<br/>Of Eormanric the Goth, chose eternal reward.}}\nThis seems to confuse two different stories as the ''Beowulf''  poet is clearly referring to the [[legends about Theoderic the Great]]. The ''[[Legends about Theoderic the Great#The Thidrekssaga|\u00dei\u00f0rekssaga]]'' tells that the warrior [[H\u00e1ma|Heime]] (''H\u00e1ma'' in Old English) takes sides against [[Ermanaric]] (\"Eormanric\"), king of the [[Goths]], and has to flee his kingdom after robbing him; later in life, Hama enters a monastery and gives them all his stolen treasure. However, this saga makes no mention of the great necklace. Possibly the ''Beowulf'' poet was confused, or invented the addition of the necklace to give him an excuse to drag in a mention of Eormanric. In any case, the necklace given to Beowulf in the story is not the Br\u00edsingamen itself; it is only being compared to it.\n\n===''Poetic Edda''===\nIn the poem ''[[\u00derymskvi\u00f0a]]'' of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', [[\u00derymr]], the king of the [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u01ebtnar]], steals [[Thor]]'s hammer, [[Mj\u00f6lnir]]. Freyja lends [[Loki]] her falcon cloak to search for it; but upon returning, Loki tells Freyja that \u00derymr has hidden the hammer and demanded to marry her in return. Freyja is so wrathful that all the [[\u00c6sir]]\u2019s halls beneath her are shaken and the necklace Br\u00edsingamen breaks off from her neck.

Eventually they find the thief, who turns out to be [[Loki]] who has transformed himself into a seal. Heimdallr turns into a seal as well and fights Loki. After a lengthy battle at [[Singasteinn]], Heimdallr wins and returns Br\u00edsingamen to Freyja.\n\n[[Snorri Sturluson]] quoted this old poem in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'', saying that because of this legend Heimdallr is called \"Seeker of Freyja's Necklace\" (''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l'', section 8) and Loki is called \"Thief of Br\u00edsingamen\" (''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l'', section 16).

When this woman wanted to buy a golden necklace (no name given) forged by four dwarves (named Dvalinn, Alfrik, Berling, and Grer), she offered them gold and silver but they replied that they would only sell it to her if she would lie a night by each of them. She came home afterward with the necklace and kept silent as if nothing happened. But a man called Loki somehow knew it, and came to tell Odin. King Odin commanded Loki to steal the necklace, so Loki turned into a fly to sneak into Freyja's bower and stole it. When Freyja found her necklace missing, she came to ask king Odin. In exchange for it, Odin ordered her to make two kings, each served by twenty kings, fight forever unless some [[Baptism|christened]] men so brave would dare to enter the battle and slay them. She said yes, and got that necklace back. Under the spell, king H\u00f6gni and king He\u00f0inn battled for one hundred and forty-three years, as soon as they fell down they had to stand up again and fight on. But in the end, the Christian lord [[Olaf Tryggvason]], who has a great fate and luck, arrived with his christened men, and whoever slain by a Christian would stay dead. Thus the pagan curse was finally dissolved by the arrival of Christianity.

The dwarves fall under the spell of the Silmaril and they claim the Nauglamir as their own \u2013 with the Silmaril attached. They kill Thingol and make off with the necklace. It is eventually recovered and is an heirloom of Thingol's descendants, eventually leading [[E\u00e4rendil]] to [[Valinor]] and resulting in the return of the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] into the affairs of [[Middle-earth]].

Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center.\n\nFormally: if <math>f: S^n \\to \\R^n</math> is continuous then there exists an <math>x\\in S^n</math> such that:  <math>f(-x)=f(x)</math>.\n\nThe case <math>n=1</math> can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the [[Earth]]'s equator with the same temperature. The same is true for any circle. This assumes the temperature varies continuously.\n\nThe case <math>n=2</math> is often illustrated by saying that at any moment, there is always a pair of antipodal points on the Earth's surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures.\n\nThe Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem has several equivalent statements in terms of [[odd function]]s.

PROOF: \n* If the theorem is correct, then it is specifically correct for odd functions, and for an odd function, <math>g(-x)=g(x)</math> iff <math>g(x)=0</math>. Hence every odd continuous function has a zero.\n* For every continuous function <math>f</math>, the following function is continuous and odd: <math>g(x)=f(x)-f(-x)</math>. If every odd continuous function has a zero, then <math>g</math> has a zero, and therefore, <math>f(x)=f(-x)</math>. Hence the theorem is correct.\n\n=== With retractions ===\nDefine a ''retraction'' as a function <math>h: S^n \\to S^{n-1}.</math> The Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following claim: there is no continuous odd retraction.\n\nProof: If the theorem is correct, then every continuous odd function from <math>S^n</math> must include 0 in its range. However,  <math>0 \\notin S^{n-1}</math> so there cannot be a continuous odd function whose range is <math>S^{n-1}</math>.\n\nConversely, if it is incorrect, then there is a continuous odd function <math>g: S^n \\to R^n</math> with no zeroes. Then we can construct another odd function <math>h: S^n \\to S^{n-1}</math> by:\n\n:<math>h(x)=\\frac{g(x)}{|g(x)|}</math>\n\nsince <math>g</math> has no zeroes, <math>h</math> is well-defined and continuous. Thus we have a continuous odd retraction.\n\n== Proofs ==\n\n===1-dimensional case===\nThe 1-dimensional case can easily be proved using the [[intermediate value theorem]] (IVT).\n\nLet <math>g</math> be an odd real-valued continuous function on a circle. Pick an arbitrary <math>x</math>. If <math>g(x)=0</math> then we are done. Otherwise, without loss of generality, <math>g(x)>0.</math> But <math>g(-x)<0.</math> Hence, by the IVT, there is a point <math>y</math> between <math>x</math> and <math>-x</math> at which <math>g(y)=0.</math>\n\n===General case - algebraic topology proof===\nAssume that <math>h: S^n \\to S^{n-1}</math> is an odd continuous function with <math>n > 2</math> (the case <math>n = 1</math> is treated above, the case <math>n = 2</math> can be handled using basic [[Covering space|covering theory]]). By passing to orbits under the antipodal action, we then get an induced function <math>h': \\mathbb{RP}^n \\to \\mathbb{RP}^{n-1},</math> which induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. By the [[Hurewicz theorem]], the induced map on cohomology with <math>\\mathbb F_2</math> coefficients, \n\n:<math> \\mathbb F_2[a]/a^{n+1} = H^*(\\mathbb{RP}^n;\\mathbb{F}_2) \\leftarrow H^*(\\mathbb{RP}^{n-1};\\mathbb F_2) = \\mathbb F_2[b]/b^{n},</math>\n\nsends <math>b</math> to <math>a</math>.

Label each vertex <math>v</math> of the triangulation with a label <math>l(v)\\in {\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\ldots, \\pm n}</math> in the following way:\n\n* The absolute value of the label is the ''index'' of the coordinate with the highest absolute value of ''g'': <math>|l(v)| = \\arg\\max_k (g(v)_k)</math>.\n* The sign of the label is the sign of ''g'', so that: <math>l(v) = \\sgn (g(v)) |l(v)|</math>.\n\nBecause ''g'' is odd, the labeling is also odd: <math>l(-v) = -l(v)</math>. Hence, by Tucker's lemma, there are two adjacent vertices <math>u, v</math> with opposite labels. Assume w.l.o.g. that the labels are <math>l(u)=1, l(v)=-1</math>. By the definition of ''l'', this means that in both <math>g(u)</math> and <math>g(v)</math>, coordinate #1 is the largest coordinate: in <math>g(u)</math> this coordinate is positive while in <math>g(v)</math> it is negative. By the construction of the triangulation, the distance between <math>g(u)</math> and <math>g(v)</math> is at most <math>\\epsilon</math>, so in particular <math>|g(u)_1 - g(v)_1| = |g(u)_1| + |g(v)_1| \\leq \\epsilon </math> (since <math>g(u)_1</math> and <math>g(v)_1</math> have opposite signs) and so <math>|g(u)_1|, |g(v)_1| \\leq \\epsilon</math>. But since the largest coordinate of <math>g(u)</math> and <math>g(v)</math> is coordinate #1, this means that  <math>|g(u)_k|, |g(v)_k| \\leq \\epsilon</math> for each  <math>1 \\leq k \\leq n</math>.

He knows most of skaldship, and after him skaldship is called ''bragr'', and from his name that one is called ''bragr''-man or -woman, who possesses eloquence surpassing others, of women or of men. His wife is [[I\u00f0unn]].}}\n\nIn ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' Snorri writes:\n{{quote|How should one periphrase Bragi? By calling him ''husband of I\u00f0unn'', ''first maker of poetry'', and ''the long-bearded god'' (after his name, a man who has a great beard is called Beard-Bragi), and ''son of Odin''.}}\n\nThat Bragi is Odin's son is clearly mentioned only here and in some versions of a list of the sons of Odin (see '''[[Sons of Odin]]'''). But \"wish-son\" in stanza 16 of the ''[[Lokasenna]]'' could mean \"Odin's son\" and is translated by Hollander as ''Odin's kin''. Bragi's mother is possibly the giantess [[Gunnlod]]. If Bragi's mother is [[Frigg]], then Frigg is somewhat dismissive of Bragi in the ''Lokasenna'' in stanza 27 when Frigg complains that if she had a son in [[\u00c6gir]]'s hall as brave as [[Baldr]] then [[Loki]] would have to fight for his life.\n\nIn that poem Bragi at first forbids Loki to enter the hall but is overruled by Odin. Loki then gives a greeting to all gods and goddesses who are in the hall save to Bragi. Bragi generously offers his sword, horse, and an arm ring as peace gift but Loki only responds by accusing Bragi of cowardice, of being the most afraid to fight of any of the [[\u00c6sir]] and [[Elves]] within the hall. Bragi responds that if they were outside the hall, he would have Loki's head, but Loki only repeats the accusation. When Bragi's wife I\u00f0unn attempts to calm Bragi, Loki accuses her of embracing her brother's slayer, a reference to matters that have not survived. It may be that Bragi had slain I\u00f0unn's brother.\n\nA passage in the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l]]'' describes runes being graven on the sun, on the ear of one of the sun-horses and on the hoofs of the other, on [[Sleipnir]]'s teeth, on bear's paw, on eagle's beak, on wolf's claw, and on several other things including on Bragi's tongue. Then the runes are shaved off and the shavings are mixed with mead and sent abroad so that \u00c6sir have some, Elves have some, [[Vanir]] have some, and Men have some, these being speech runes and birth runes, ale runes, and magic runes. The meaning of this is obscure.\n\nThe first part of Snorri Sturluson's ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' is a dialogue between [[\u00c6gir]] and Bragi about the nature of poetry, particularly skaldic poetry. Bragi tells the origin of the mead of poetry from the blood of [[Kvasir]] and how Odin obtained this mead. He then goes on to discuss various poetic metaphors known as ''[[kenning]]s''.\n\nSnorri Sturluson clearly distinguishes the god Bragi from the mortal skald Bragi Boddason, whom he often mentions separately. The appearance of Bragi in the ''Lokasenna'' indicates that if these two Bragis were originally the same, they have become separated for that author also, or that chronology has become very muddled and Bragi Boddason has been relocated to mythological time. Compare the appearance of the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Taliesin]] in the second branch of the [[Mabinogion|Mabinogi]]. Legendary chronology sometimes does become muddled. Whether Bragi the god originally arose as a deified version of Bragi Boddason was much debated in the 19th century, especially by the scholars [[Eugen Mogk]] and [[Sophus Bugge]].<ref>[[John Lindow]], \"Narrative worlds, human environments, and poets: The case of Bragi\", in ''Old Norse Religion in Long-Term Perspectives: Origins, Changes, and Interactions'', ed. Anders Andr\u00e9n, Kristina Jennbert and Catharina Raudvere, V\u00e4gar till Midg\u00e5rd 8, Lund: Nordic Academic Press, 2012, {{ISBN|9789187121159}}, pp.&nbsp;21&ndash;25, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gjq6rvoIRpAC&pg=PA21&dq=Eugen+Mogk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sWzeVJb5KMmzoQT_ooCgDQ&ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&q=Eugen%20Mogk&f=false p.&nbsp;21].</ref> The debate remains undecided.\n\nIn the poem ''[[Eir\u00edksm\u00e1l]]'' Odin, in [[Valhalla]], hears the coming of the dead [[Norway|Norwegian]] king [[Eric Bloodaxe]] and his host, and bids the heroes [[Sigmund]] and [[Sinfj\u00f6tli]] rise to greet him. Bragi is then mentioned, questioning how Odin knows that it is Eric and why Odin has let such a king die. In the poem ''[[H\u00e1konarm\u00e1l]]'', H\u00e1kon the Good is taken to Valhalla by the [[valkyrie]] [[G\u00f6ndul]] and Odin sends [[Herm\u00f3\u00f0r]] and Bragi to greet him. In these poems Bragi could be either a god or a dead hero in Valhalla. Attempting to decide is further confused because ''Herm\u00f3\u00f0r'' also seems to be sometimes the name of a god and sometimes the name of a hero. That Bragi was also the first to speak to Loki in the ''Lokasenna'' as Loki attempted to enter the hall might be a parallel. It might have been useful and customary that a man of great eloquence and versed in poetry should greet those entering a hall.\n\n==Skalds named Bragi==\n\n===Bragi Boddason===\n{{main|Bragi Boddason}}\nIn the ''Prose Edda'' Snorri Sturluson quotes many stanzas attributed to '''Bragi Boddason''' the old (''Bragi Boddason inn gamli''), a Norwegian court poet who served several Swedish kings, [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], [[\u00d6sten Beli]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn at Hauge]] who reigned in the first half of the 9th century. This Bragi was reckoned as the first skaldic poet, and was certainly the earliest skaldic poet then remembered by name whose verse survived in memory.\n\nSnorri especially quotes passages from Bragi's ''[[Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa]]'', a poem supposedly composed in honor of the famous legendary Viking [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Lodbr\u00f3k]] ('Hairy-breeches') describing the images on a decorated shield which Ragnar had given to Bragi. The images included Thor's fishing for [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], [[Gefjun]]'s ploughing of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] from the soil of Sweden, the attack of [[Hamdir and Sorli]] against King [[Ermanaric|J\u00f6rmunrekk]], and the never-ending battle between [[Hedin and H\u00f6gni]].\n\n===Bragi son of H\u00e1lfdan the Old===\n'''Bragi son of H\u00e1lfdan the Old''' is mentioned only in the ''Skj\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l''. This Bragi is the sixth of the second of two groups of nine sons fathered by King H\u00e1lfdan the Old on Alvig the Wise, daughter of King Eymund of [[Novgorod|H\u00f3lmgard]]. This second group of sons are all eponymous ancestors of legendary families of the north. Snorri says:\n<blockquote>\nBragi, from whom the Bragnings are sprung (that is the race of H\u00e1lfdan the Generous).\n</blockquote>\nOf the Bragnings as a race and of H\u00e1lfdan the Generous nothing else is known. However, ''Bragning'' is often, like some others of these dynastic names, used in poetry as a general word for 'king' or 'ruler'.\n\n===Bragi H\u00f6gnason===\nIn the eddic poem ''[[Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana II]]'', '''Bragi H\u00f6gnason''', his brother Dag, and his sister Sigr\u00fan were children of [[H\u00f6gne]], the king of [[East G\u00f6taland]]. The poem relates how [[Sigmund]]'s son [[Helgi Hundingsbane]] agreed to take Sigr\u00fan daughter of H\u00f6gni as his wife against her unwilling betrothal to Hodbrodd son of [[Granmar]] the king of [[S\u00f6dermanland]]. In the subsequent battle of Frekastein (probably one of the 300 [[hill fort]]s of S\u00f6dermanland, as ''stein'' meant \"hill fort\") against H\u00f6gni and Grammar, all the chieftains on Granmar's side are slain, including Bragi, except for Bragi's brother Dag.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* DuBois, Thomas A.

He was a [[child prodigy]] who was educated by his father, a tax collector in [[Rouen]]. Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the study of [[fluid]]s, and clarified the concepts of [[pressure]] and [[vacuum]] by generalising the work of [[Evangelista Torricelli]]. Pascal also wrote in defence of the [[scientific method]].\n\nIn 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines.

Following [[Galileo Galilei]] and Torricelli, in 1647, he rebutted [[Aristotle]]'s followers who insisted that [[Horror vacui (physics)|nature abhors a vacuum]]. Pascal's results caused many disputes before being accepted.\n\nIn 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within [[Catholicism]] known by its detractors as [[Jansenism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11511a.htm |title=Blaise Pascal |accessdate=23 February 2009 |work=Catholic Encyclopedia}}</ref> Following a religious experience in late 1654, he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the ''[[Lettres provinciales]]'' and the ''[[Pens\u00e9es]]'', the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and [[Jesuits]]. In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659, he wrote on the [[cycloid]] and its use in calculating the volume of solids.\n\nThroughout his life, Pascal was in frail health, especially after the age of 18; he died just two months after his 39th birthday.<ref>Hald, Anders ''A History of Probability and Statistics and Its Applications before 1750'', (Wiley Publications, 1990) pp.44</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\nPascal was born in [[Clermont-Ferrand]], which is in France's [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne region]]. He lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three.{{sfn|Devlin|p=20}} His father, [[\u00c9tienne Pascal]] (1588\u20131651), who also had an interest in science and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the \"[[Nobles of the Robe|Noblesse de Robe]]\". Pascal had two sisters, the younger [[Jacqueline Pascal|Jacqueline]] and the elder Gilberte.\n\nIn 1631, five years after the death of his wife,<ref name=\"MCS\">{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J.J. |last2=Robertson |first2=E.F. |authorlink1=John J.

The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the family. \u00c9tienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise. The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science.\n\n[[File:Blaise Pascal 2.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Pascal]]\n\nParticularly of interest to Pascal was a work of [[G\u00e9rard Desargues|Desargues]] on [[conic section]]s. Following Desargues' thinking, the 16-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the \"Mystic Hexagram\", ''Essai pour les coniques'' (\"Essay on Conics\") and sent it\u2014his first serious work of mathematics\u2014to [[Marin Mersenne|P\u00e8re Mersenne]] in Paris; it is known still today as [[Pascal's theorem]]. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line).\n\nPascal's work was so precocious that Descartes was convinced that Pascal's father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son and not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: \"I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,\" adding, \"but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child.\"<ref>''[[The Story of Civilization]]: Volume 8, \"The Age of Louis XIV\"'' by [[Will Durant|Will & Ariel Durant]]; chapter II, subsection 4.1 p.56)</ref>\n\nIn France at that time offices and positions could be\u2014and were\u2014bought and sold. In 1631, \u00c9tienne sold his position as second president of the ''[[Cour des Aides]]'' for 65,665 [[livres]].<ref>Connor, James A., ''Pascal's wager: the man who played dice with God'' (HarperCollins, NY, 2006) {{isbn|0-06-076691-3}} p. 42</ref> The money was invested in a [[government bond]] which provided, if not a lavish, then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris. But in 1638 Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the [[Thirty Years' War]], defaulted on the government's bonds. Suddenly \u00c9tienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.\n\n[[File:Pascaline-CnAM 823-1-IMG 1506-black.jpg|thumb|An early [[Pascaline]] on display at the [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers]], Paris]]\n\nLike so many others, \u00c9tienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that \u00c9tienne was pardoned. In time, \u00c9tienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of [[Rouen]]\u2014a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.\n\nIn 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called ''[[Pascal's calculator]]'' or the ''Pascaline''. Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers]] in Paris and one more by the [[Zwinger museum]] in [[Dresden]], Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators.<ref>A complete list of known Pascalines and also a review of contemporary replicas can be found at [http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.SurvivingPascalines Surviving Pascalines] and [http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.ReplicaPascalines Replica Pascalines] at http://things-that-count.net</ref> Although these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of [[computer engineering]], the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a [[status symbol]], for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design.\n\n==Contributions to mathematics==\n[[File:PascalTriangleAnimated2.gif|thumb|[[Pascal's triangle]].

From this discussion, the notion of [[expected value]] was introduced. Pascal later (in the ''Pens\u00e9es'') used a probabilistic argument, [[Pascal's Wager]], to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]' formulation of the [[calculus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/courses/436/Honors02/leibniz.html |title=The Mathematical Leibniz |publisher=Math.rutgers.edu |accessdate=16 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter a religious experience in 1654, Pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics.\n\n===Philosophy of mathematics===\nPascal's major contribution to the [[philosophy of mathematics]] came with his ''De l'Esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique'' (\"Of the Geometrical Spirit\"), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous \"''[[Petites \u00e9coles de Port-Royal|Petites-Ecoles de Port-Royal]]\" (\"Little Schools of Port-Royal\")''. The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up\u2014first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.\n\nPascal also used ''De l'Esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique'' to develop a theory of [[definition]]. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of [[essentialism]]. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalism]] as formulated by Descartes.\n\nIn ''De l'Art de persuader'' (\"On the Art of Persuasion\"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's [[axiomatic method]], specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the [[axioms]] upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with [[Montaigne]] that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.\n\n==Contributions to the physical sciences==\n[[File:Pascal's Barrel.png|thumb|An illustration of the (apocryphal) [[Pascal's barrel]] experiment]]\n\nPascal's work in the fields of the study of [[hydrodynamics]] and [[hydrostatics]] centered on the principles of [[hydraulic fluid]]s. His inventions include the [[hydraulic press]] (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the [[syringe]]. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as [[Pascal's barrel]] experiment.\n\nBy 1647, Pascal had learned of [[Evangelista Torricelli]]'s experimentation with [[barometer]]s. Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a [[vacuum]], some invisible matter was present. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and that this substance was forever in motion. Furthermore, \"Everything that is in motion must be moved by something,\" [[Aristotle]] declared.<ref>Aristotle, ''Physics'', VII, 1.</ref> Therefore, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal's time, a vacuum was an impossibility. How so? As proof it was pointed out:\n* Light passed through the so-called \"vacuum\" in the glass tube.\n* Aristotle wrote how everything moved, and must be moved by something.\n* Therefore, since there had to be an invisible \"something\" to move the light through the glass tube, there was no vacuum in the tube. Not in the glass tube or anywhere else. Vacuums \u2013 the absence of any and everything \u2013 were simply an impossibility.\n\nFollowing more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced ''Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide'' (\"New experiments with the vacuum\"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by [[air pressure]]. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. This work was followed by ''R\u00e9cit de la grande exp\u00e9rience de l\u2019\u00e9quilibre des liqueurs'' (\"Account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids\") published in 1648.\n\nThe [[Torricellian vacuum]] found that air pressure is equal to the weight of 30 inches of mercury. If air has a finite weight, Earth's atmosphere must have a maximum height. Pascal reasoned that if true, air pressure on a high mountain must be less than at a lower altitude. He lived near the [[Puy de D\u00f4me]] mountain, {{convert|4790|ft}} tall, but his health was poor so could not climb it.<ref name=\"ley196606\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |last3=\n |first3=\n |date=June 1966\n |title=The Re-Designed Solar System\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v24n05_1966-06#page/n93/mode/2up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=94\u2013106\n |type=\n}}</ref> On 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, [[Florin P\u00e9rier]], husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal's theory.

The mercury dropped two lines.\n\nIn the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in Pascal's empty space, Pascal, in his reply to [[Estienne Noel]],<!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! --> gave one of the 17th century's major statements on the scientific method, which is a striking anticipation of the idea popularised by [[Karl Popper]] that scientific theories are characterised by their [[falsifiability]]: \"In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity.\"<ref>''Pour faire qu'une hypoth\u00e8se soit \u00e9vidente, il ne suffit pas que tous les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes s'en ensuivent, au lieu que, s'il s'ensuit quelque chose de contraire \u00e0 un seul des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes, cela suffit pour assurer de sa fausset\u00e9'', in ''Les Lettres de Blaise Pascal: Accompagn\u00e9es de Lettres de ses Correspondants Publi\u00e9es'', ed.

Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal \"would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...\"<ref>Connor, James A., ''Pascal's wager: the man who played dice with God'' (HarperCollins, NY, 2006) {{isbn|0-06-076691-3}} p. 70</ref> But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become regular visitors.\n\nBoth men were followers of [[Jean Guillebert]], proponent of a splinter group from Catholic teaching known as [[Jansenism]]. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous [[Augustinism]]. Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and after their successful treatment of his father, borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors. In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of \"first conversion\" and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year.\n\nPascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his \"worldly period\" (1648\u201354). His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and his sister Jacqueline, for whom Pascal acted as conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a [[postulant]] in the Jansenist convent of [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal]]. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he needed her just as she had needed him.\n\n{{quote|Suddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn't work, either. At the heart of this was...Blaise's fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind...[but] nothing would change her mind.<ref>Miel, Jan. ''Pascal and Theology''. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1969), p. 122</ref>}}\n\nBy the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother.  Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, \"He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor...\"<ref>Jacqueline Pascal, ''\"Memoir\"'' p. 87</ref>\nIn early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline,\nPascal formally signed over the whole of his sister's inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, \"had begun to smell like a cult.\"<ref>Miel, Jan. ''Pascal and Theology''. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1969), p. 124</ref> With two thirds of his father's estate now gone, the 29-year-old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty.\n\nFor a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.<ref name=\"ep52\">Richard H.

God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars...\" and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: \"I will not forget thy word. Amen.\" He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death.<ref name=\"oc618\">Pascal, Blaise.

For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the ''Provincial Letters''.\n\n===The ''Provincial Letters''===\n{{Main|Lettres provinciales}}\n{{French literature sidebar}}\n\nBeginning in 1656\u201357, Pascal published his memorable attack on [[casuistry]], a popular [[Ethics|ethical]] method used by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] thinkers in the early modern period (especially the [[Jesuits]], and in particular [[Antonio Escobar y Mendoza|Antonio Escobar]]). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of [[sin]]s. The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. The king ordered that the book be [[book burning|shredded and burnt]] in 1660. In 1661, in the midsts of the [[formulary controversy]], the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 [[papal bull]] condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied [[Alexander VII]] himself. Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments.\n\nAside from their religious influence, the ''Provincial Letters'' were popular as a literary work. Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].\n\nCharles Perrault wrote of the ''Letters'': \"Everything is there\u2014purity of language, nobility of thought, solidity in reasoning, finesse in raillery, and throughout an ''agr\u00e9ment'' not to be found anywhere else.\"<ref>Charles Perrault, ''Parall\u00e8le des Anciens et des Modernes'' (Paris, 1693), Vol. I, p. 296.</ref>\n\n=== The ''Pens\u00e9es'' ===\n{{Main|Pens\u00e9es}}\n\nPascal's most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the ''Pens\u00e9es'' (\"Thoughts\"), was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the [[Christian faith]], with the original title ''Apologie de la religion Chr\u00e9tienne'' (\"Defense of the Christian Religion\"). The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled ''Pens\u00e9es de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets'' (\"Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects\") and soon thereafter became a classic. One of the ''Apologie''{{'}}s main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of [[skepticism]] and [[stoicism]], personalized by [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] on one hand, and [[Epictetus]] on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.\n\nPascal's ''Pens\u00e9es'' is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in ''French prose''. When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]] praised it as the finest pages in the [[French language]].<ref name=\"finest\">Sainte-Beuve, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I0P0A8XK29QC&pg=PA167 ''Seventeenth Century''] {{isbn|1-113-16675-4}} p. 174 (2009 reprint).</ref> [[Will Durant]] hailed the Pens\u00e9es as \"the most eloquent book in French prose\".<ref name=\"eloquent\">''[[The Story of Civilization]]: Volume 8, \"The Age of Louis XIV\"'' by [[Will Durant|Will & Ariel Durant]], chapter II, Subsection 4.4, p. 66 {{isbn|1-56731-019-2}}</ref>\n\n===Last works and death===\n[[File:Epitaph Blaise Pascal Saint-Etienne.jpg|thumb|Pascal's epitaph in [[Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont]], where he was buried]]\n\n[[T. S. Eliot]] described him during this phase of his life as \"a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world.\" Pascal's ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer. In 1659, Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, \"Sickness is the natural state of Christians.\"<ref name=\"m104-\">Muir, Jane.

In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, ''\u00c9crit sur la signature du formulaire'' (\"Writ on the Signing of the Form\"), exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his [[polemics]] on [[Jansenism]]. Pascal's last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line, the [[carrosses \u00e0 cinq sols]], moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats.\n\nIn 1662, Pascal's illness became more violent, and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister's death. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on 18 August 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received [[extreme unction]]. He died the next morning, his last words being \"May God never abandon me,\" and was buried in the cemetery of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont]].<ref name=\"m104-\"/>\n\nAn [[autopsy]] performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with [[brain damage|damage to his brain]].

Originally applied to gambling, today it is extremely important in economics, especially in [[actuarial science]]. John Ross writes, \"Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual's and society's ability to influence the course of future events.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ross|first1=John F.|title=Pascal's legacy|journal=EMBO Reports|volume=5|pages=S7\u2013S10|year=2004|pmid=15459727|pmc=1299210 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400229|issue=Suppl 1}}</ref> However, it should be noted that Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. [[Christiaan Huygens]], learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include [[Abraham de Moivre]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].\n\nIn literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later [[polemic]]ists. The content of his literary work is best remembered for its strong opposition to the [[rationalism]] of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and simultaneous assertion that the main countervailing philosophy, [[empiricism]], was also insufficient for determining major truths.\n\nIn France, prestigious annual awards, [[Blaise Pascal Chair]]s are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the [[\u00cele-de-France (region)|Ile de France]] region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chaires-blaise-pascal.org/uk/index.html |title=Chaires Blaise Pascal |publisher=Chaires Blaise Pascal |accessdate=16 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613064029/http://www.chaires-blaise-pascal.org/uk/index.html |archivedate=13 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> One of the Universities of [[Clermont-Ferrand]], France \u2013 [[Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal]] \u2013 is named after him.

The name ''Brittonic'' derives ultimately from the name {{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Prettanike}}), recorded  by Greek authors for the [[British Isles]]. \n\nThe Brittonic languages derive from the [[Common Brittonic]] language, spoken throughout [[Great Britain]] south of the [[Firth of Forth]] during the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Roman period]]. In addition, North of the Forth, the [[Pictish language]] is considered to be related; it is possible it was a Brittonic language, but it may have been a sister language. In the 5th and 6th centuries emigrating Britons also took Brittonic speech to the continent, most significantly in [[Brittany]] and [[Britonia]]. During the next few centuries the language began to split into several dialects, eventually evolving into [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]. Welsh and Breton continue to be spoken as native languages, while a revival in Cornish has led to an increase in speakers of that language. Cumbric is extinct, having been replaced by [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] and [[English language|English]] speech.  The [[Isle of Man]] and [[Orkney]] may also have originally spoken a Brittonic language, later replaced with a Goidelic one.  Due to emigration, there are also communities of Brittonic language speakers in [[England]], [[France]], and {{lang|cy|[[Y Wladfa]]}} (the Welsh settlement in [[Patagonia]]).\n\n==Name==\nThe names \"Brittonic\" and \"Brythonic\" are scholarly conventions referring to the [[Celtic languages]] of Britain and to the ancestral language they originated from, designated [[Common Brittonic]], in contrast to the [[Goidelic languages]] originating in Ireland. Both were created in the 19th century to avoid the ambiguity of earlier terms such as \"British\" and \"Cymric\".<ref name=\"OEDBrythonic\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Brythonic, adj. and n. |encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=June 2013 |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/272106?redirectedFrom=Brythonic& |accessdate=July 17, 2013 }}</ref> \"Brythonic\" was coined in 1879 by the Celticist [[John Rhys]] from the Welsh word {{lang|cy|Brython}}.<ref name=\"OEDBrythonic\"/><ref name=\"Jackson\">Jackson, p. 3.</ref> \"Brittonic\", derived from \"[[Britons (Celtic people)|Briton]]\" and also earlier spelled \"Britonic\" and \"Britonnic\", emerged later in the 19th century.<ref name=\"OEDBrittonic\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Brittonic, adj. and n. |encyclopedia=[[OED Online]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=June 2013 |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/23485? |accessdate=July 17, 2013 }}</ref> It became more prominent through the 20th century, and was used in [[Kenneth H.

Jackson, and later [[John T. Koch]], use \"British\" only for the early phase of the Common Brittonic language.<ref name=\"Koch305\"/>\n\nPrior to Jackson's work, \"Brittonic\" (and \"Brythonic\") were often used for all the [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|P-Celtic languages]], including not just the varieties in Britain but those [[Continental Celtic languages]] that similarly experienced the evolution of the [[Proto-Celtic language]] element {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}} to {{IPA|/p/}}. However, subsequent writers have tended to follow Jackson's scheme, rendering this use obsolete.<ref name=Koch305/>\n\n==Evidence==\nKnowledge of the Brittonic languages comes from a variety of sources. For the early languages information is obtained from coins, inscriptions and comments by classical writers as well as place names and personal names recorded by them. For later languages there is information from medieval writers and modern native speakers, together with place names. The names recorded in the Roman period are given in Rivet and Smith.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Brittonic branch is also referred to as '''P-Celtic''' because [[linguistic reconstruction]] of the Brittonic reflex of the Proto-Indo-European phoneme *''k\u02b7'' is ''p'' as opposed to Goidelic ''c''. Such nomenclature usually implies an acceptance of the P-Celtic and Q-Celtic hypothesis rather than the Insular Celtic hypothesis because the term includes certain Continental Celtic languages as well. (For a discussion, see [[Celtic languages]].)\n\nOther major characteristics include:\n* The retention of the Proto-Celtic sequences ''am'' and ''an'', which mostly result from the Proto-Indo-European syllabic nasals.\n* Celtic {{IPA|/w/}} (written ''u'' in Latin texts and ''ou'' in Greek) became ''gw-'' in initial position, ''-w-'' internally, whereas in Gaelic it is ''f-'' in initial position and disappears internally:\n** Proto-Celtic ''*windos'' \"white\" became Welsh ''gwyn'', Cornish ''gwynn'', Breton ''gwenn''.

Welsh and Breton have been spoken continuously since they formed. For all practical purposes Cornish died out during the 18th or 19th centuries, but a revival movement has more recently created small numbers of new speakers. Also notable are the extinct language [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], and possibly the extinct [[Pictish language|Pictish]]. One view, advanced in the 1950s and based on apparently unintelligible [[ogham]] inscriptions, was that the Picts may have also used a non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language.<ref>Jackson, 1955</ref> This view, while attracting broad popular appeal, has virtually no following in contemporary linguistic scholarship.<ref>Driscoll, 2011</ref>\n\n==History and origins==\n[[File:Map Gaels Brythons Picts.png|thumb|right|250px|Britain & Ireland in the early\u2013mid 1st millennium, before the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|founding of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]].\n{{legend|#c14135|outline=#676767|Mainly Brittonic areas.}}\n{{legend|#4970c0|outline=#676767|Mainly [[Pictish language|Pictish]] areas.}}\n{{legend|#64855a|outline=#676767|Mainly [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] areas.}}]]\nThe modern Brittonic languages are generally considered to all derive from a common ancestral language termed ''Brittonic'', ''British'', ''Common Brittonic'', ''Old Brittonic'' or ''Proto-Brittonic'', which is thought to have developed from Proto-Celtic or early Insular Celtic by the 6th century BC.<ref>{{cite book| title=An Atlas for Celtic Studies| first=John T.| last=Koch| publisher=Oxbow Books| location=Oxford| year=2007| isbn=978-1-84217-309-1}}</ref>\n\nBrittonic languages were probably spoken prior to the Roman invasion at least in the majority of [[Great Britain]] south of the rivers [[River Forth|Forth]] and [[River Clyde|Clyde]], though the [[Isle of Man]] later had a Goidelic language, [[Manx language|Manx]]. Northern Scotland mainly spoke [[Common Brittonic#Pritenic|Pritennic]], which became the [[Pictish language]], which may have been a Brittonic language like that of its neighbors. The theory has been advanced (notably by [[O'Rahilly's historical model|T. F. O'Rahilly]]) that part of [[Ireland]] spoke a Brittonic language, usually termed ''Ivernic'', before it was displaced by [[Primitive Irish]], although the authors Dillon and Chadwick reject this theory as being implausible.\n\nDuring the period of the Roman occupation of what are now [[England]] and [[Wales]] (AD 43 to c. 410), Common Brittonic borrowed a large stock of [[Latin]] words, both for concepts unfamiliar in the pre-urban society of Celtic Britain such as urbanisation and new tactics of warfare as well as for rather more mundane words which displaced native terms (most notably, the word for \"fish\" in all the Brittonic languages derives from the Latin ''piscis'' rather than the native *''\u0113skos'' - which may survive, however, in the Welsh name of the [[River Usk]], {{lang|cy|Wysg}}). Approximately 800 of these Latin loan-words have survived in the three modern Brittonic languages.\n\nIt is probable that at the start of the Post-Roman period ''Common Brittonic'' was differentiated into at least two major dialect groups \u2013 Southwestern and Western (in addition we may posit additional dialects, such as Eastern Brittonic, spoken in what is now the [[East of England]], which have left little or no evidence). Between the end of the Roman occupation and the mid 6th century the two dialects began to diverge into recognisably separate languages, the Western into Cumbric and Welsh and the Southwestern into Cornish and its closely related sister language Breton, which was carried to continental [[Armorica]]. Jackson showed that a few of the dialect distinctions between West and Southwest Brittonic go back a long way. New divergencies began around AD 500 but other changes which were shared occurred in the 6th century.  Other common changes occurred in the 7th century onward and are possibly due to inherent tendencies. Thus the concept of a common Brittonic language ends by AD 600. Substantial numbers of Britons certainly remained in the expanding area controlled by [[Anglo-Saxons]], but over the fifth and sixth centuries they mostly adopted the [[English language]].<ref>R. Fleming, ''Britain After Rome'' (2011), p. 45-119.</ref><ref>H. Tristram, \"Why Don't the English Speak Welsh?\", in Higham (ed.), ''Britons in Anglo-Saxon England'' (2007), p. 192-214.</ref><ref>D.

The [[Celtic language-death in England|displacement of the languages of Brittonic descent]] was probably complete in all of Britain except [[Cornwall]] and [[Wales]] and the English counties bordering these areas such as [[Devon]] by the 11th century. Western [[Herefordshire]] continued to speak Welsh until the late nineteenth century, and isolated pockets of [[Shropshire]] speak Welsh today.\n\nThe regular [[consonant]]al [[sound change]]s from Proto-Celtic to Welsh, Cornish and Breton are summarised in the following table.

Names derived (sometimes indirectly) from Brittonic include [[London]], [[Penicuik]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Aberdeen]], [[York]], [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], [[Dover]] and [[Colchester]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Brittonic elements found in England include ''bre-'' and ''bal-'' for hills, while some such as combe or [[cwm (landform)|coomb(e)]] for a small deep valley and [[tor (rock formation)|tor]] for a hill are examples of Brittonic words that were borrowed into English. Others reflect the presence of Britons such as [[Dumbarton]] \u2013 from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''D\u00f9n Breatainn'' meaning \"Fort of the Britons\", or Walton meaning a ''tun'' or settlement where the ''[[walhaz|Wealh]]'' \"Britons\" still lived.\n\nThe number of Celtic river names in England generally increases from east to west, a map showing these being given by Jackson. These names include ones such as Avon, Chew, Frome, Axe, Brue and Exe, but also river names containing the elements \"der-/dar-/dur-\" and \"-went\" e.g. \"Derwent, Darwen, Deer, Adur, Dour, Darent, Went\". In fact these names exhibit multiple different Celtic roots. One is *dubri- \"water\" [Bret. \"dour\", C. \"dowr\", W. \"d\u0175r\"], also found in the place-name \"Dover\" (attested in the Roman period as \"Dubr\u012bs\"); this is the original source of rivers named \"Dour\". Another is *deru\u032fo- \"oak\" or \"true\" [Bret. \"derv\", C. \"derow\", W. \"derw\"], coupled with two agent suffixes, *-ent- and *-i\u016b; this is the origin of \"Derwent\", \" Darent\" and \"Darwen\" (attested in the Roman period as \"Deru\u032fenti\u014d\"). The final root to be examined is \"went\". In Roman Britain there were three tribal capitals named \"U\u032fent\u0101\" (modern Winchester, Caerwent and Caistor St Edmunds), whose meaning was 'place, town'.<ref>Matasovi\u0107, Ranko (2009). ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'', p. 413. Brill, Leiden-Boston. {{ISBN|978-90-04-17336-1}}</ref>\n\n===Brittonicisms in English===\n{{main|Brittonicisms in English}}\n{{further|List of English words of Brittonic origin}}\nSome, including [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] have argued that Celtic has acted as a substrate to English for both the lexicon and syntax. It is generally accepted that linguistic effects on English were lexically rather poor aside from toponyms, consisting of a few domestic words, which '''may''' include <em>hubbub</em>, <em>dad</em>, <em>[[peat]]</em>, <em>[[bucket]]</em>, <em>crock</em>, <em>crumpet</em> (cf. Br. <em lang=\"br\">krampouz</em>), <em>noggin</em>, <em>gob</em> (cf. Gaelic <em lang=\"gd\">gob</em>), <em>nook</em>; and the dialectal term for a [[badger]], i.e. ''brock'' (cf. Welsh <em lang=\"cy\">broch</em>, C. <em lang=\"kw\">brogh</em> and Gaelic <em lang=\"gd\">broc</em>). Another legacy may be the sheep-counting system [[Yan tan tethera|Yan Tan Tethera]] in the west, in the traditionally Celtic areas of England such as [[Cumbria]]. Several Cornish mining words are still in use in English language mining terminology, such as [[costean]], [[gunnies]], and [[vug]].<ref>''Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms'' by American Geological Institute and U S Bureau of Mines (pages 128, 249, and 613)</ref>\n\nThose who argue against the theory of a Brittonic substratum and heavy influence point out that many toponyms have no semantic continuation from the Brittonic language. A notable example is <em>Avon</em> which comes from the Celtic term for river <em lang=\"cel\">abona</em><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Avon&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref> or the Welsh term for river, <em lang=\"cy\">afon</em>, but was used by the English as a personal name. Likewise the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire]] contains the word <em lang=\"cel\">usa</em> which merely means \u2018water\u2019<ref>A. Room (ed.) 1992: ''Brewer's Dictionary of Names'', Oxford: Helicon, p. 396-7.</ref> and the name of the river Trent simply comes from the Welsh word for a trespasser ''(an over-flowing river)''<ref name=ecec>{{cite book \n  | last = Hickey\n | first = Raymond\n | title = 'Early Contact And Parallels Between English and Celtic.' in 'Vienna English Working Papers'}}\n</ref>\nIt has been argued that the use of [[periphrastic]] constructions (using [[auxiliary verb]]s such as ''do'' and ''be'' in the continuous/progressive) in the English [[verb]], which is more widespread than in the other [[Germanic languages]], is traceable to Brittonic influence. Some however find this very unlikely and claim a native English development rather than Celtic influence, though Roberts postulates Northern Germanic influence, despite such constructions not existing in Norse.<ref name=roberts>{{cite book \n  | last = Roberts\n | first = Ian G.\n | title = 'Verbs and diachronic syntax: a comparative history of English and French Volume 28 of Studies in natural language and linguistic theory Volume 28 of NATO Asi Series. Series C, Mathematical and Physical Science'}}\n</ref> Literary Welsh has the simple present <em lang=\"cy\">Caraf</em> = ''I love'' and the present stative (al. continuous/progressive) <em lang=\"cy\">Yr wyf yn caru</em> = ''I am loving'', where the Brittonic syntax is partly mirrored in English (Note that ''I am loving'' comes from older ''I am a-loving'', from still older <em lang=\"meng\">ich am on luvende </em> \u201cI am in the process of loving\u201d). In the Germanic sister languages of English there is only one form, for example <em lang=\"de\">ich liebe </em> in German, though in ''colloquial'' usage in some German dialects, a progressive aspect form has evolved which is formally similar to those found in Celtic languages, and somewhat less similar to the Modern English form, e.g. \u201cI am working\u201d is <em lang=\"de\">ich bin am Arbeiten</em>, literally: \u201cI am on the working\u201d. The same structure is also found in modern Dutch (<em lang=\"nl\">ik ben aan het werk</em>), alongside other structures (e.g. <em lang=\"nl\">ik zit te werken</em>, lit. \u201cI sit to working\u201d). These parallel developments suggest that the English progressive is not necessarily due to Celtic influence; moreover, the native English development of the structure can be traced over the over 1000 years of English literature.\n\nSome researchers (Filppula ''et al.'', 2001)  argue that English syntax reflects more extensive Brittonic influences.<ref name=\"ecec\"/><ref name=Gelderen>{{cite book \n  | last = van Gelderen\n | first = Elly\n | title = 'A History of the English Language'}}\n</ref> For instance, in English [[tag question]]s, the form of the tag depends on the verb form in the main statement (''aren't I?'', ''isn't he?'', ''won't we?'' etc.). The German <em lang=\"de\">nicht wahr?</em> and the French <em lang=\"fr\">n\u2019est-ce pas?</em>, by contrast, are fixed forms which can be used with almost any main statement. It has been claimed that the English system has been borrowed from Brittonic, since Welsh tag questions vary in almost exactly the same way.<ref name=\"ecec\"/><ref name=\"Gelderen\"/>\n\n===Brittonic effect on the Goidelic languages===\nFar more notable, but less well known, are Brittonic influences on [[Scottish Gaelic]], though Scottish and Irish Gaelic, with their wider range of preposition-based periphastic constructions, suggest that such constructions descend from their common Celtic heritage. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but as there is a far greater overlap in terms of Celtic vocabulary, than with English, it is not always possible to disentangle P- and Q-Celtic words. However some common words such as <em lang=\"gd\">monadh</em> = Welsh <em lang=\"cy\">mynydd</em>, Cumbric <em lang=\"cel\">*monidh</em> are particularly evident.\n\nOften the Brittonic influence on Scots Gaelic is indicated by considering [[Irish language]] usage, which is not likely to have been influenced so much by Brittonic. In particular, the word <em lang=\"gd\">srath</em> ([[Anglicisation|anglicised]] as \u201cStrath\u201d) is a native Goidelic word, but its usage appears to have been modified by the Brittonic cognate <em lang=\"cy\">ystrad</em> whose meaning is slightly different. The effect on Irish has been the loan from British of many Latin-derived words. This has been associated with the Christianisation of Ireland from Britain.\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n*Aleini M (1996).

All members of the group were [[Coming out|openly gay]] and their songs reflected this, often containing political commentary on [[gay]]-related issues.  The initial line-up, which recorded the majority of the band's hits, consisted of [[Jimmy Somerville]] (vocals), Steve Bronski (keyboards, percussion) and Larry Steinbachek (keyboards, percussion).  Somerville left Bronski Beat in 1985, and went on to have success as lead singer of [[The Communards]] and as a solo artist.  He was replaced by new vocalist John Foster, with whom the band continued to have hits in the UK and Europe through 1986.  Foster left Bronski Beat after their second album, and the band used a series of vocalists before dissolving in 1996.\n\nSteve Bronski, the only remaining original member, now leads a revived touring version of the band, and is recording new material for release in 2017 alongside '90s member Ian Donaldson.\n\n==History==\n===1983\u201385: Early years and ''The Age of Consent''===\n{{see also|The Age of Consent (album)}}\nBronski Beat formed in 1983 when Somerville, Bronski (both from Glasgow), and Steinbachek (from Southend) shared a three-bedroom flat at Lancaster House in [[Brixton]]. Steinbachek had heard Somerville singing during the making of ''[[Framed Youth: The Revenge of the Teenage Perverts]]'' and suggested they make some music. They first performed publicly at an arts festival ''September in the Pink''. The trio were unhappy with the inoffensive nature of contemporary gay performers and sought to be more outspoken and political.<ref name=\"Spinmay85\">{{cite journal|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|date=May 1985|title=What is Bronski Beat?|journal=SPIN|page=41|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=9ugCQfxwym0C&pg=PA41&dq=bronski+beaT&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiv-da4gMDRAhVBpZQKHS5gBKMQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&q=bronski%20beaT&f=false}}</ref><!-- cites para -->\n\nBronski Beat signed a [[recording contract]] with [[London Records]] in 1984 after doing only nine live [[concert|gigs]].

The inner sleeve listed the varying [[age of consent|ages of consent]] for consensual gay sex in different nations around the world. At the time, the age of consent for sexual acts between men in the UK was 21 compared with 16 for heterosexual acts, with several other countries having more liberal laws on gay sex. The album peaked at 4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]],<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> 36 in the U.S., and 12 in Australia.\n\nAround the same time, the band headlined \"Pits and Perverts\", a concert at the [[Electric Ballroom]] in London to raise funds for the [[Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners]] campaign.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Lucy|title=Gay men and the left in post-war Britain: how the personal got political|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7190-7434-9}}</ref> This event is featured in the film ''[[Pride (2014 film)|Pride]]''.\n\nThe third single, released before Christmas 1984, was a revival of \"[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]\", the [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] classic (from ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''). The song questions the accuracy of biblical tales. It also reached the UK Top 20.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nIn 1985, the trio joined up with [[Marc Almond]] to record a version of [[Donna Summer]]'s \"[[I Feel Love]]\". The full version was actually a [[Medley (music)|medley]] that also incorporated snippets of Summer's \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]\" and [[John Leyton]]'s \"[[Johnny Remember Me]]\".

However, the single was shelved as tensions in the band, both personal and political, resulted in Somerville leaving Bronski Beat in the summer of that year.\n\n\"Run From Love\" was subsequently released in a [[remix]] form on the Bronski Beat album ''[[Hundreds & Thousands (album)|Hundreds & Thousands]]'', a collection of mostly remixes (LP) and [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] (as bonus tracks on the CD version) as well as the hit \"I Feel Love\". Somerville went on to form [[Communards (band)|The Communards]] with [[Richard Coles]] while the remaining members of Bronski Beat searched for a new vocalist.\n\n===1985\u20131995: Post-Jimmy Somerville phase===\nBronski Beat recruited John Foster as Somerville's replacement (Foster is credited as \"Jon Jon\"). A single, \"[[Hit That Perfect Beat]]\", was released in November 1985, reaching 3 in the UK.<ref name=\"charts\" /> It repeated this success on the Australian chart<ref name=\"auchart\"/> and was also featured in the film ''[[Letter to Brezhnev]]''. A second single, \"C'mon C'mon\", also charted in the UK Top 20 and an album, ''[[Truthdare Doubledare]]'', released in May 1986, peaked at 18. The film ''[[Parting Glances]]'' (1986) included Bronski Beat songs \"Love and Money\", \"Smalltown Boy\" and \"Why?\". During this period, the band teamed up with producer Mark Cunningham on the first-ever [[BBC]] [[Children In Need]] single, a cover of David Bowie's \"[[Heroes (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]\", released in 1986 under the name of The County Line.\n\nFoster left the band in 1987. Following Foster's departure, Bronski Beat began work on their next album, ''Out and About''. The tracks were recorded at Berry Street studios in London with engineer Brian Pugsley. Some of the song titles were \"The Final Spin\" and \"Peace And Love\". The latter track featured [[Strawberry Switchblade]] vocalist [[Rose McDowall]] and appeared on several internet sites in 2006. One of the other songs from the project called \"European Boy\" was recorded in 1987 by disco group Splash. The lead singer of Splash was former [[Tight Fit]] singer Steve Grant. Steinbachek and Bronski toured extensively with the new material and got great reviews, however the project was abandoned as the group were dropped by London Records. Also in 1987, Bronski Beat and Somerville performed at a reunion concert for \"International AIDS Day\", supported by [[New Order (band)|New Order]], at the [[Brixton Academy]], London.\n\nIn 1989, Jonathan Hellyer became lead singer, and the band extensively toured the U.S. and Europe with back-up vocalist Annie Conway. They achieved one minor hit with the song \"Cha Cha Heels\", a one-off collaboration sung by American actress and singer [[Eartha Kitt]], which peaked at 32 in the UK.<ref name=\"charts\" /> The song was originally written for movie and recording star [[Divine (actor)|Divine]], who was unable to record the song before his death in 1988. 1990\u201391 saw Bronski Beat release three further singles on the Zomba record label, \"I'm Gonna Run Away\", \"One More Chance\" and \"What More Can I Say\". The singles were produced by [[Mike Thorne]].\n\nFoster and Bronski Beat teamed up again in 1994, and released a [[techno]] \"Tell Me Why '94\" and an [[acoustic music|acoustic]] \"Smalltown Boy '94\" on the German [[record label]], [[ZYX Music]]. The album ''Rainbow Nation'' was released the following year with Hellyer returning as lead vocalist, as Foster had dropped out of the project and Ian Donaldson was brought on board to do keyboards and programming. After a few years of touring the world Bronski Beat then dissolved, with Steve Bronski going on to become a producer for other artists and Ian Donaldson becoming a successful DJ (Sordid Soundz). Larry Steinbachek became the musical director for [[Michael Laub]]'s theatre company, 'Remote Control Productions'.\n\n===2007-Present: Steve Bronski solo activities and new version of Bronski  Beat===\n\nIn 2007, Steve Bronski remixed the song \"Stranger to None\" by the UK [[alternative rock]] band, [[All Living Fear]]. Four different mixes were made, with one appearing on their retrospective album, ''Fifteen Years After''. Bronski also remixed the track \"Flowers in the Morning\" by Northern Irish [[electronic music|electronic]] band Electrobronze in 2007, changing the style of the song from [[Classical music|classical]] to [[Hi-NRG]] disco.\n\nIn 2015, Steve Bronski teamed up as a one-off with Jessica James (aka Barbara Bush) and said that she reminded him of Divine, because of her look and Eartha Kitt-like sound. The one-off project was to cover the track he made in 1989.\n\nIn 2016-17 Jessica worked on her self-penned track \"Mistress of Pleasure\" which Steve Bronski wrote the music for, along with Paul Miles, for her forthcoming show ''A Night with the Historical Whores''.\n\nIn 2016, Steve Bronski again teamed up with Ian Donaldson, with the aim of bringing Bronski Beat back, enlisting a new singer, Stephen Granville. In 2017, The new Bronski Beat released a reworked version of \"Age of Consent\" entitled \"Age of Reason\".\n\n''Out & About'', the unreleased Bronski Beat album from 1987, was released digitally via Steve Bronski's website. The album features the original tracks plus remixes by Bronski.\n\nOn 12 January 2017, Larry Steinbachek's sister Louise Jones told BBC News he had died the previous month after a short battle with cancer, with his family and friends at his bedside.<ref name=\"steinbachek-death\">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38597071 | title=Bronski Beat keyboardist Larry Steinbachek dies at 56 | work=[[BBC News Online]] | date=12 January 2017 | accessdate=12 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Members==\nThe original member set of Bronski Beat was [[Jimmy Somerville]] (vocals), Steve Bronski and Larry Steinbachek (keyboards).

In citations of main memory ([[Random access memory|RAM]]) capacity, ''gigabyte'' customarily means {{val|1073741824}} bytes. As this is a power of 1024, and 1024 is a [[power of two]] (2<sup>10</sup>), this usage is referred to as a [[Binary number|binary]] measurement.\n\nIn most other contexts, the industry uses the multipliers ''kilo'', ''mega'', ''giga'', etc., in a manner consistent with their meaning in the [[International System of Units]] (SI), namely as powers of 1000. For example, a 500 gigabyte hard disk holds {{val|500000000000}} bytes, and a 1 Gbit/s (gigabit per second) [[Ethernet]] connection transfers data at {{val|1000000000}} bit/s. In contrast with the ''binary prefix'' usage, this use is described as a ''decimal prefix'', as 1000 is a [[Powers of 10|power of 10]] (10<sup>3</sup>).\n\nThe use of the same unit prefixes with two different meanings has caused confusion. Starting around 1998, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and several other standards and trade organizations addressed the ambiguity by publishing standards and recommendations for a set of binary prefixes that refer exclusively to powers of 1024.  Accordingly, the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) requires that [[SI prefix]]es only be used in the decimal sense:<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/prefixes.html\n | title = SI prefixes\n |author=<!--Not stated--> \n | website = The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty: International System of Units (SI)\n | publisher = [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]\n | access-date = 2017-04-03}}</ref> [[kilobyte]] and [[megabyte]] denote one thousand bytes and one million bytes respectively (consistent with SI), while new terms such as [[kibibyte]], [[mebibyte]] and [[gibibyte]], having the symbols KiB, MiB, and GiB, denote 1024 bytes, {{val|1048576}} bytes, and {{val|1073741824}} bytes, respectively.<ref name=\"NIST-biprefix\"/>  In 2008, the IEC prefixes were incorporated into the international standard [[Units_of_measurement#Systems_of_units|system of units]] used alongside the [[International System of Quantities]] (see [[ISO/IEC 80000#Information science and technology|ISO/IEC 80000]]).\n\n==History==\n===Main memory===\nEarly computers used one of two addressing methods to access the system memory; binary (base 2) or decimal (base 10).<ref>{{cite journal\n|title = A Third Survey of Domestic Electronic Digital Computing Systems: Chapter III Analysis and Trends\n|quote = Of 187 different relevant systems, 131 utilize a straight binary system internally, whereas 53 utilize the decimal system (primarily binary coded decimal) and 3 systems utilize a binary coded alphanumeric system of notation.\n|journal = Ballistic Research Laboratories Report No. 1115\n| first = Martin H. \n|last = Weik\n|date=March 1961\n|page = 1027\n|url = http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61analysis.html#STORAGE\n}} This lengthy report describes many of the early computers.</ref>\nFor example, the [[IBM 701]] (1952) used binary and could address 2048 [[Word (data type)|words]] of 36 [[bit]]s each, while the [[IBM 702]] (1953) used decimal and could address ten thousand 7-bit words.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, binary addressing had become the standard architecture in most computer designs, and main memory sizes were most commonly powers of two. This is the most natural configuration for memory, as all combinations of their address lines map to a valid address, allowing easy aggregation into a larger block of memory with contiguous addresses.\n\nEarly computer system documentation would specify the memory size with an exact number such as 4096, 8192, or 16384 words of storage. These are all [[Power of two|powers of two]], and furthermore are small multiples of 2<sup>10</sup>, or 1024. As storage capacities increased, several different methods were developed to abbreviate these quantities.\n\nThe method most commonly used today uses prefixes such as kilo, mega, giga, and corresponding symbols K, M, and G, which the computer industry originally adopted from the [[metric system]]. The prefixes ''kilo-'' and ''mega-'', meaning 1000 and {{val|1000000}} respectively, were commonly used in the electronics industry before World War II.<ref>Hunting Trouble on 28 Megacycles, A. L. Blais, QST, January 1930.</ref> \nAlong with ''giga-'' or G-, meaning {{val|1000000000}}, they are now known as [[SI prefixes]]<ref group=\"defn.\" name=\"d.SIp\"/> after the [[International System of Units]] (SI), introduced in 1960 to formalize aspects of the metric system.  \n\nThe International System of Units does not define units for digital information but notes that the SI prefixes may be applied outside the contexts where base units or derived units would be used. But as computer main memory in a \nbinary-addressed system is manufactured in sizes that were easily expressed as multiples of 1024, ''kilobyte'', when applied to computer memory, came to be used to mean 1024 bytes instead of 1000.  This usage is not consistent with the SI.  Compliance with the SI requires that the prefixes take their 1000-based meaning, and that they are not to be used as placeholders for other numbers, like 1024.<ref>{{SIbrochure8th|page=121}}</ref>\n\nThe use of K in the binary sense as in a \"32K core\" meaning {{nowrap|32 \u00d7 1024}} words, i.e., {{val|32768}} words, can be found as early as 1959.<ref\nname = \"32K 1959\">{{Cite journal\n| last = Real | first = P.\n| title = A generalized analysis of variance program utilizing binary logic.\n| journal = ACM '59: Preprints of papers presented at the 14th national meeting of the Association for Computing Machinery\n| pages = 78\u20131\u201378\u20135 |date=September 1959 | doi = 10.1145/612201.612294 | publisher = ACM Press\n|quote = On a 32K core size 704 computer, approximately {{val|28000}} data may be analyzed, ... without resorting to auxiliary tape storage.}} Note: the IBM 704 core memory units had 4096 36-bit words.

Unlike computer main memory, there is nothing in a disk drive that causes, or even influences, the capacity to be an integer multiple of a power of 1024. For example, the first commercially sold disk drive, the [[IBM 350]], had 50 (not 32 or 64) physical disk \"platters\" containing a total of 50,000 sectors of 100 characters each, for a total quoted capacity of \"5 million characters.\"<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_350.html\n|work=IBM Archives\n|title=IBM 350 disk storage unit\n|author=IBM Corporation}}</ref> It was introduced in September 1956. \n\nIn the 1960s most disk drives used IBM's variable block length format (called [[Count Key Data]] or \"CKD\").<ref>IBM invented the disk drive in 1956 and until the late 1960s its drives and their clones were dominant. See, e.g. [http://www.hagley.lib.de.us/1980.htm US vs. IBM antitrust litigation (Jan 1969)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507065825/http://www.hagley.lib.de.us/1980.htm |date=May 7, 2008 }}, especially IBM analyses of Memorex and other disk drive companies.</ref>\nAny block size could be specified up to the maximum track length.  Since the block headers occupied space, the usable capacity of the drive was dependent on the block size.  Blocks (\"records\" in IBM's terminology) of 88, 96, 880 and 960 were often used because they related to the fixed block size of 80- and 96-character punch cards. The drive capacity was usually stated under conditions of full track record blocking. For example, the 100-megabyte 3336 disk pack only achieved that capacity with a full track block size of 13,030 bytes.\n\n[[Floppy_disk#3.C2.BD-inch_floppy_disk|Floppy disks]] for the IBM PC and compatibles quickly [[List_of_floppy_disk_formats#Known_disk_logical_formats|standardized on 512-byte sectors]], so two sectors were easily referred to as \"1K\".  The 3.5-inch \"360 KB\" and \"720 KB\" had 720 (single-sided) and 1440 sectors (double-sided) respectively.  When the High Density \"1.44 MB\" floppies came along, with 2880 of these 512-byte sectors, that terminology represented a hybrid binary-decimal definition of \"1 MB\" = 2<sup>10</sup> x 10<sup>3</sup> =1&thinsp;024&thinsp;000 bytes.\n\nIn contrast, [[hard disk]] drive manufacturers used \"megabytes\" or \"MB\", meaning 10<sup>6</sup> bytes, to characterize their products as early as 1974.<ref>The [http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/cdc/discs/brochures/ProductLine_Oct74.pdf CDC Product Line Card] unambiguously uses MB to characterize HDD capacity in millions of bytes</ref>  By 1977, in its first edition, Disk/Trend, a leading hard disk drive industry marketing consultancy segmented the industry according to MBs (decimal sense) of capacity.<ref>1977 Disk/Trend Report \u2013 Rigid Disk Drives, published June 1977</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest hard disk drives in personal computing history,\nthe Seagate [[ST-412]], was specified as \"Formatted: 10.0 Megabytes\".<ref>{{cite book\n|url=http://maben.homeip.net/static/S100/seagate/disks/Seagate%20ST412%20OEM%20Manual%201982.pdf\n|title=ST506/412 OEM Manual\n|author= Seagate Corporation\n|date= April 1982\n|page=3}}</ref>  More precisely, the drive contains 4 heads or active surfaces (tracks per cylinder), 306 cylinders, and when formatted with a sector size of 256 bytes and 32 sectors/track results in a capacity of {{val|10027008|u=bytes}}. This drive was one of several types installed into the [[IBM PC/XT]]<ref>IBM Tells MiniScribe It Is Cutting Back On Winchester Orders, Computer System News, Jan 1, 1984, p. 1</ref> and extensively advertised and reported as a \"10&nbsp;MB\" (formatted) hard disk drive.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mellor |first=Chris |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/06/oldest_seagate_drive_in_uk/ |title=It's the oldest working Seagate drive in the UK |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2011-04-06 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>\nThe factor of 306 cylinders (rather than 256 or 512, both of which are powers of two) in the calculation causes the capacity to be not conveniently close to a power of 1024; operating systems and programs using the customary binary prefixes<ref group=\"defn.\" name=\"d.cbp\"/> show this as \"9.5625&nbsp;MB\". Many later drives in the personal computer market used 17 sectors per track; still later, [[zone bit recording]] was introduced, causing the number of sectors per track to vary from the outer track to the inner. Nor are drives required to have a number of active surfaces that is a power of, or even divisible by, two; drives with e.g. three active surfaces are not uncommon. All of these factors reduce the utility of the customary binary prefixes for expressing drive capacity. \n\nToday, the hard drive industry continues to use decimal prefixes for drive capacity (as well as for transfer rate). For example, a \"300&nbsp;GB\" hard drive offers slightly more than 300\u00d710<sup>9</sup>, or {{val|300000000000}}, bytes, not {{nowrap|300 \u00d7 2<sup>30</sup>}} (which would be about {{val|322|e=9}}).  Operating systems such as [[Microsoft Windows]] that display hard drive sizes using the customary binary prefix \"GB\" (as it is used for RAM) would display this as \"279.4&nbsp;GB\" (meaning {{nowrap|279.4 \u00d7 1024<sup>3</sup>}} bytes, or {{nowrap|279.4 \u00d7 {{val|1073741824|u=B}}}}). On the other hand, [[Mac OS X]] has since version 10.6 shown hard drive size using decimal prefixes (thus matching the drive makers' packaging). (Previous versions of Mac OS used binary prefixes.)\n\nHowever, other usages still occur. For example, in one document, Seagate specifies data transfer rates of some of its hard drives in ''both'' IEC and decimal units.<ref name=savvio>\n[http://www.seagate.com/staticfiles/support/docs/manual/enterprise/savvio/10K.5/100628561d.pdf Seagate Savvio 10K.5 SAS Product Manual], 100628561, Rev D, March 2011, sec 5.2.3, p. 10 (18th page of the pdf), states the drive's sustained transfer speed as \"89 to 160 [[MiB]]/s\" on one line, and \"93 to 168&nbsp;MB/s\" on the next line.</ref> \n\"Advanced Format\" drives using 4096-byte sectors are described as having \"4K sectors.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Marketing Bulletin: Advanced Format 4K Sector Transition  Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/whitepaper/mb604_4k_transition_faq.pdf|publisher=[[Seagate Technology]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715030704/http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/whitepaper/mb604_4k_transition_faq.pdf|archivedate=15 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Information transfer and clock rates===\nComputer [[Clock signal|clock]] frequencies are always quoted using SI prefixes in their decimal sense. For example, the internal clock frequency of the original [[IBM PC]] was 4.77&nbsp;MHz, that is {{val|4770000|u=Hz}}.\nSimilarly, digital information transfer rates are quoted using decimal prefixes:\n* The ATA-100 disk interface refers to {{val|100000000}} bytes per second\n* A \"56K\" modem refers to {{val|56000}} bits per second\n* SATA-2 has a raw bit rate of 3&nbsp;Gbit/s = {{val|3000000000}} bits per second\n* PC2-6400 [[Random access memory|RAM]] transfers {{val|6400000000}} bytes per second\n* Firewire 800 has a raw rate of {{val|800000000}} bits per second\n* However, as of 2011, Seagate specifies the transfer speed of some hard disk drives with IEC binary prefixes in addition to decimal units.<ref name=savvio/>\n\n===Standardization of dual definitions===\nBy the mid-1970s it was common to see K meaning 1024 and the occasional M meaning {{val|1048576}} for words or bytes of main memory (RAM) while K and M were commonly used with their decimal meaning for disk storage. In the 1980s, as capacities of both types of devices increased, the SI prefix G, with SI meaning, was commonly applied to disk storage, while M in its binary meaning, became common for computer memory. In the 1990s, the prefix G, in its binary meaning, became commonly used for computer memory capacity. The first terabyte (SI prefix, {{val|1000000000000}} bytes) hard disk drive was introduced in 2007.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,128400-page,1/article.html\n|title=Hitachi Introduces 1-Terabyte Hard Drive\n|work=PC World\n|date=2007-01-04\n|accessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref>\n\nThe dual usage of the kilo (K), mega (M), and giga (G) prefixes as both powers of 1000 and powers of 1024 has been recorded in standards and dictionaries.

In addition, it was common for computer manufacturers to specify their products with capacities in full precision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PP2075.html |title=System/360 Model 75 |publisher=[[IBM]]|accessdate=2015-03-10|work=IBM Archives|quote=up to 1,048,576 characters of information}}</ref>\n\nIn the personal computing era, one source of consumer confusion is the difference in the way many operating systems display hard drive sizes, compared to the way hard drive manufacturers describe them. [[#Disk drives|Hard drives]] are specified and sold using \"GB\" and \"TB\" in their decimal meaning: one billion and one trillion bytes. Many operating systems and other software, however, display hard drive and file sizes using \"MB\", \"GB\" or other SI-looking prefixes in their binary sense, just as they do for displays of RAM capacity. For example, many such systems display a hard drive marketed as \"160&nbsp;GB\" as \"149.05&nbsp;GB\". The earliest known presentation of hard disk drive capacity by an operating system using \"KB\" or \"MB\" in a binary sense is 1984;<ref>Apple [[Macintosh]] which began using \"KB\" in a binary sense to report HDD capacity beginning 1984.</ref> earlier operating systems generally presented the hard disk drive capacity as an exact number of bytes, with no prefix of any sort, for example, in the output of the MS-DOS or PC&nbsp;DOS [[CHKDSK]] command.\n\n===Legal disputes===\nThe different interpretations of disk size prefixes has led to three significant class action lawsuits against digital storage manufacturers.\nOne case involved flash memory and the other two involved hard disk drives.\nTwo of these were settled with the manufacturers admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to clarify the storage capacity of their products on the consumer packaging.\nFlash memory and hard disk manufacturers now have disclaimers on their packaging and web sites clarifying the formatted capacity of the devices\nor defining MB as 1 million bytes and 1&nbsp;GB as 1 billion bytes.<ref name=\"wdc-CaviarSE16\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.wdc.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=301\n  | title = WD Caviar SE16 SATA Hard Drives\n  | work = Western Digital: Products\n  | publisher = [[Western Digital Corporation]]\n  | accessdate = 2007-09-09\n  | deadurl = yes\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070902080558/http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=301\n  | archivedate = 2007-09-02\n  | df = \n  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  | url = http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=33071\n  | title = Jack Flash F.A.Q.\n  | publisher = [[Corsair Memory]]\n  | accessdate = 2014-06-20\n  | quote = [...] the industry-standard definition of a megabyte (MByte) for flash devices is one million (1,000,000) bytes, where the operating system uses two to the twentieth power, or 1,048,576 bytes.

They should not be used to indicate powers of 2 (for example, one kilobit represents 1000 bits and not 1024 bits). The IEC has adopted prefixes for binary powers in the international standard IEC 60027-2: 2005, third edition, ''Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology \u2013 Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics''. The names and symbols for the prefixes corresponding to 2<sup>10</sup>, 2<sup>20</sup>, 2<sup>30</sup>, 2<sup>40</sup>, 2<sup>50</sup>, and 2<sup>60</sup> are, respectively: kibi, Ki; mebi, Mi; gibi, Gi; tebi, Ti; pebi, Pi; and exbi, Ei. Thus, for example, one kibibyte would be written: 1&nbsp;KiB = 2<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;B = 1024&nbsp;B, where B denotes a byte.

These include [[wear leveling]], error correction, sparing, and metadata needed by the device's internal firmware.\n\n====Floppy drives====\n[[Floppy disk]]s have existed in numerous physical and logical [[List of floppy disk formats|formats]], and have been sized inconsistently.  In part, this is because the end user capacity of a particular disk is a function of the controller hardware, so that the same disk could be formatted to a variety of capacities.  In many cases, the media are marketed without any indication of the end user capacity, as for example, DSDD, meaning double-sided double-density.\n\nThe last widely adopted diskette was the 3\u00bd-inch high density. This has a formatted capacity of {{val|1474560}} bytes or 1440&nbsp;KB (1440 \u00d7 1024, using \"KB\" in the customary binary sense). These are marketed as \"HD\", or \"1.44&nbsp;MB\" or both. This usage creates a third definition of \"megabyte\" as 1000\u00d71024 bytes.\n\nMost operating systems display the capacity using \"MB\" in the customary binary sense, resulting in a display of \"1.4&nbsp;MB\" ({{val|1.40625|u=MiB}}). Some users have noticed the missing 0.04&nbsp;MB and both Apple and Microsoft have support bulletins referring to them as 1.4&nbsp;MB.<ref\n name=\"Microsoft 121839\">{{cite web\n | last = Microsoft\n | title = Determining Actual Disk Size: Why 1.44&nbsp;MB Should Be 1.40&nbsp;MB\n | work = Article ID: 121839\n | publisher =Microsoft\n | date = 2003-05-06\n | url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/121839\n | accessdate = 2007-07-07\n}} \"The 1.44-megabyte (MB) value associated with the 3.5-inch disk format does not represent the actual size or free space of these disks.

The largest 8-inch diskette formats could contain more than a megabyte, and the capacities of those devices were often irregularly specified in megabytes, also without controversy.\n\nOlder and smaller diskette formats were usually identified as an accurate number of (binary) KB, for example the [[Disk II|Apple Disk II]] described as \"140KB\" had a 140\u00d71024-byte capacity, and the original \"360KB\" double sided, double density disk drive used on the IBM PC had a 360\u00d71024-byte capacity.\n\nIn many cases diskette hardware was marketed based on unformatted capacity, and the overhead required to format sectors on the media would reduce the nominal capacity as well (and this overhead typically varied based on the size of the formatted sectors), leading to more irregularities.\n\n====Optical discs====\nThe capacities of most [[optical disc]] storage media like [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[HD DVD]] and [[Magneto-optical drive|magneto-optical (MO)]]  are given using SI decimal prefixes.\nA \"4.7&nbsp;GB\" DVD has a nominal capacity of about 4.38&nbsp;[[GiB]].<ref name=\"dvdcap\">[http://www.osta.org/technology/pdf/dvdqa.pdf#page=20 Understanding Recordable and Rewritable DVD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102065839/http://www.osta.org/technology/pdf/dvdqa.pdf#page=20 |date=January 2, 2011 }}</ref>  However, [[compact disc|CD]] capacities are always given using customary binary prefixes.

A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee.<ref name=\"Walker\">{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-halloffame&prov=ap&type=lgns|title=Vets committee throws another shutout at Hall of Fame|accessdate=2007-02-28|last=Walker|first=Ben|date=2007-02-28|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Players receiving 5% or more of the votes but fewer than 75% are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/baseball-hall-of-fame-changes-its-induction-rules?ymd=20140726&content_id=86398586&vkey=news_mlb|title=Hall reduces eligibility from 15 years to 10|accessdate=2014-07-26|last=Bloom|first=Barry M.|date=2014-07-26}}</ref>\n\nUnder special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. [[Addie Joss]] was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. [[Roberto Clemente]]'s induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.\n\n{{Quote box|width=15em|border=3px|align=right|bgcolor=#FAF0E6|qalign=center|title=''Lineup for Yesterday''|quote=''Z is for Zenith''<br />''The summit of fame.''<br />''These men are up there.''<br />''These men are the game.''|source= \u2014 ''[[Ogden Nash]]'', [[Sport (US magazine)|''Sport'' magazine]] (January 1949)<ref>{{cite web|title=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> }}The five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; [[Joe DiMaggio]] received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement.\n\nContrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for [[Lou Gehrig]] (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|terminally ill]], making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.\n\nIf a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 10 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following changes to the election process for that body made in 2010 and 2016, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballot\u2014both long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives). From 2011 through 2016, each candidate could be considered once every three years;<ref name=\"2010 changes\">{{cite press release|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/voting-news/hall-fame-board-directors-restructures-procedures-consideration-managers-umpires|title=Hall of Fame Board of Directors Restructures Procedures for Consideration of Managers, Umpires, Executives and Long-Retired Players|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|date=2010-07-26|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref>  now, the frequency depends on the era in which an individual made his greatest contributions.<ref name=\"2016 changes\">{{cite press release|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/hall-of-fame-announcements |title=Hall of Fame Makes Series of Announcements |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |date=July 23, 2016 |accessdate=August 14, 2016}}</ref> A more complete discussion of the new process is available [[#Changes to Veterans Committee process|below]].\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, following changes made by the Hall in July 2007, the main Veterans Committee, then made up of living Hall of Famers, voted only on players whose careers began in 1943 or later. These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:\n* One committee voted on managers and umpires for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee voted only twice\u2014 [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2008|in 2007 for induction in 2008]] and [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2010|in 2009 for induction in 2010]].\n* One committee voted on executives and builders for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee conducted its only two votes in the same years as the managers/umpires committee.\n* The pre\u2013World War II players committee was intended to vote every five years on players whose careers began in 1942 or earlier. It conducted its only vote as part of the election process [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2009|for induction in 2009]].<ref name=\"HoF-VC-1942\">{{cite web|author=National Baseball Hall of Fame|title=Rules for election of pre\u2013World War II players|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|year=2009|url=http://community.baseballhall.org/Page.aspx?pid=391|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref>\n\nPlayers of the [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]] have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005 the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro Leagues figures were primarily considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871\u20131946 era, called the \"Pre-Integration Era\" by the Hall; since 2016, Negro Leagues figures are primarily considered alongside other figures from what the Hall calls the \"Early Baseball\" era (1871\u20131949).\n\nPredictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, [[Bill James]]' book ''[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?]]'' goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.\n\n===Changes to Veterans Committee process===\n{{Main article|Veterans Committee}}\nThe actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.<ref name=\"NYT-2001ChassReform\">{{cite news|last=Chass|first=Murray|title=More Vets Eligible For Hall In Baseball|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2001-08-07|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E7D71E3CF934A3575BC0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"TBT-2001Reform\">{{cite web|last=Enders|first=Eric|title=Same Old Story|publisher=Baseball Think Factory|date=2001-08-08|url=http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/primate_studies/discussion/eric_enders_2001-08-08_0/|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"BP-Traven\">{{cite web|last=Traven |first=Neal |title=A Brief History of the Veterans Committee |publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]] |date=2003-01-14 |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20030114traven.shtml |accessdate=2008-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101234319/http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20030114traven.shtml |archivedate=1 November 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-1988Leo\">{{cite news|last=Leo|first=John|title=Housecleaning Plan for the Hall of Fame|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1988-01-24|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE103DF937A15752C0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"BP-Miller\">{{cite web|last=Jaffe|first=Jay|title=Marvin Miller|work=Prospectus Q&A|publisher=Baseball Prospectus|date=2008-06-02|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=7608|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees.<ref name=\"hof-changes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm |title=Changes to Veterans Committee Procedures |accessdate=2007-01-06 |work=baseballhalloffame.org |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929063713/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm |archivedate=2006-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The revamped Committee held three elections, in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2003|2003]] and [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2007|2007]], for both players and non-players, and in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005|2005]] for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, most of whom were Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer [[Mike Schmidt]] noted, \"The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.\"<ref name=\"Walker\"/> In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.\n\nIn the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2008|2008 election process]]. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2009|2009 election process]]; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for pre\u2013World War II players elected [[Joe Gordon]] in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-World War II panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.\n\nFurther changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall on July 26, 2010, effective with the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2011|2011 election]].<ref name=\"2010 changes\"/>\n\nAll individuals eligible for induction but not eligible for BBWAA consideration were considered on a single ballot, grouped by the following eras in which they made their greatest contributions:\n* Pre-Integration Era (1871\u20131946)\n* Golden Era (1947\u20131972)\n* Expansion Era (1973 and later)\n\nThe Hall used the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee to formulate the ballots for each era, consisting of 12 individuals for the Expansion Era and 10 for the other eras. The Hall's board of directors selected a committee of 16 voters for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee met and voted at the Baseball Winter Meetings once every three years. The Expansion Era committee held its first vote in 2010 for 2011 induction, with longtime [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Pat Gillick]] becoming the first individual elected under the new procedure. The [[Golden Era Veterans Committee|Golden Era committee]] voted in 2011 for the induction class of 2012, with [[Ron Santo]] becoming the first player elected under the new procedure. The Pre-Integration Era committee voted in 2012 for the induction class of 2013, electing three figures. Subsequent elections rotated among the three committees in that order through the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2011|2016 election]].\n\nIn July 2016, however, the Hall of Fame announced a restructuring of the timeframes to be considered, with a much greater emphasis on modern eras. Four new committees were established:\n* Today's Game (1988\u2013present)\n* Modern Baseball (1970\u20131987)\n* Golden Days (1950\u20131969)\n* Early Baseball (1871\u20131949)\n\nAll committees' ballots now include 10 candidates. At least one committee convenes each December as part of the election process for the following calendar year's induction ceremony. The Early Baseball committee convenes only in years ending in 0 (2020, 2030). The Golden Days committee convenes only in years ending in 0 and 5 (2020, 2025). The remaining two committees convene twice every 5 years. More specifically, the Today's Game and Modern Baseball committees alternate their meetings in that order, skipping years in which either the Early Baseball or Golden Days committee meets. This means that in the next two 5-year cycles, the Today's Game committee (having met in 2016) will meet in 2018, 2021, and 2023, while the Modern Baseball committee (which met in 2017) will meet in 2019, 2022 and 2024.\n\nThe eligibility criteria for Era Committee consideration differ between players, managers, and executives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rules/eras-committees |title=Era Rules for Election |work=Eras Committees |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref>\n* Players: Must be retired for at least 15 seasons. This means that no player will be eligible for committee consideration until a minimum of 10 years after he first becomes eligible to appear on the BBWAA ballot, regardless of whether or not he appears on a ballot.\n** The Hall has not yet established a policy on when players who die while active or during the standard 5-year waiting period for BBWAA eligibility will be eligible for committee consideration. As noted earlier, such players become eligible for the BBWAA ballot 6 months after their deaths.\n* Managers and umpires who have served at least 10 seasons in that role are eligible 5 years after retirement, unless they are 65 or older, in which case the waiting period is 6 months.\n* Executives are eligible 5 years after retirement, or upon reaching age 70. For those who meet the age cutoff, they are explicitly eligible for consideration regardless of their current position in an organization or their status as active or retired. Before the 2016 changes to the committee system, active executives 65 years or older were eligible for consideration.<ref name=\"2016 changes\"/>\n\n===Players and managers with multiple teams===\nWhile the text on a player's or manager's plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are usually depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, though in a few cases, like umpires, they wear caps without logos. (Executives are not depicted wearing caps.) Additionally, as of 2015, inductee biographies on the Hall's website for all players and managers, and executives who were associated with specific teams, list a \"primary team\", which does not necessarily match the cap logo. The Hall selects the logo \"based on where that player makes his most indelible mark.\"<ref name=\"FAQ-logoSelection\">{{cite web|title=Who decides what team logo will be used on Hall of Fame plaques?|work=Hall of Famers: FAQ|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|year=2009|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp#logo|accessdate=2009-07-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213123303/http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp|archivedate=2009-02-13}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of inductees associated with multiple teams are the following:\n*'''[[Frank Robinson]]''': Robinson chose to have the [[Baltimore Orioles]] cap displayed on his plaque, although he had played ten seasons with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and six seasons with Baltimore. Robinson won four pennants and two World Series with the Orioles and one pennant with Cincinnati. His second [[World Series ring]] came in the [[1970 World Series]] against the Reds. Robinson also won an [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award while playing for each team.\n*'''[[Catfish Hunter]]''': Hunter chose not to have any logo on his cap when elected to the Hall of Fame in 1987. Hunter had success for both teams for which he played &ndash; the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City/Oakland Athletics]] (his first ten seasons) and the [[New York Yankees]] (his final five seasons). Furthermore, both during and after his career he maintained good relations with both teams and their respective owners ([[Charlie Finley|Charles Finley]] and [[George Steinbrenner]]), and did not wish to slight either team by selecting the other.\n*'''[[Nolan Ryan]]''': Born and raised in Texas, Ryan entered the Hall in 1999 wearing a [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] cap on his plaque, although he spent only five seasons with the Rangers, while raised in the Houston area and having longer and more successful tenures with the [[Houston Astros]] (nine seasons, 1980\u201388 and his record-setting fifth career no-hitter) and [[California Angels]] (eight seasons, 1972\u201379 and the first four of his seven career no-hitters). Ryan's only championship was as a member of the [[New York Mets]] in [[1969 World Series|1969]]. Ryan finished his career with the Rangers, reaching his 5000th strikeout and 300th win, and throwing the last two of his no-hitters. Ryan later took ownership of the Rangers when they were sold to his Rangers Baseball Express group in 2010. He sold his Rangers interest in 2013 and is now in the Astros' front office.\n*'''[[Reggie Jackson]]''': Jackson chose to be depicted with a Yankees cap over an Athletics cap. As a member of the Kansas City/Oakland A's, Jackson played ten seasons (1967\u201375, '87), winning three World Series ([[1972 World Series|1972]], [[1973 World Series|1973]], [[1974 World Series|1974]]) and the 1973 [[AL MVP|AL MVP Award]]. During his five years in New York (1977\u201381), Jackson won two World Series ([[1977 World Series|1977]]\u2013[[1978 World Series|78]]), with his crowning achievement occurring during [[1977 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1977 World Series]], when he hit three home runs on consecutive pitches and earned his nickname \"Mr. October\".\n*'''[[Carlton Fisk]]''': Fisk went into the hall with a [[Boston Red Sox]] cap on his plaque in 2000 despite playing with the [[Chicago White Sox]] longer and posting more significant numbers with the White Sox. Fisk's choice of the Red Sox was likely because of his being a [[New England]] native, as well as his famous \"Stay fair!\" walk-off home run in [[1975 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1975 World Series]] with which he is most associated.\n*'''[[Sparky Anderson]]''': Also in 2000, Anderson entered the Hall with a Cincinnati Reds cap on his plaque despite managing almost twice as many seasons with the [[Detroit Tigers]] (17 in Detroit; nine in Cincinnati). He chose the Reds to honor that team's former general manager [[Bob Howsam]], who gave him his first major-league managing job. Anderson won two World Series with the Reds and one with the Tigers.\n*'''[[Dave Winfield]]''': Winfield had spent the most years in his career with the Yankees and had great success there, but chose to go into the Hall as a member of the [[San Diego Padres]] due to his feud with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.\n\nIn all of the above cases, the \"primary team\" is the team for which the inductee spent the largest portion of his career except for Ryan, whose primary team is listed as the Angels despite playing one fewer season for that team than for the Astros.\n\nIn 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though [[Wade Boggs]] denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.)<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2005-01-06-boggs-sandberg-questions_x.htm|title=Boggs, Sandberg field queries as new Hall of Famers|accessdate=2008-05-21|work=USA Today|first1=Craig|last1=Muder|date=2005-01-06}}</ref> The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:\n*'''[[Gary Carter]]''': Inducted in 2003, Carter was the first player to be affected by the new policy. Carter won his only championship with the [[1986 World Series|1986]] New York Mets, and wanted his induction plaque to depict him wearing a Mets cap, though he had spent twelve years (1974\u201384, 1992) with the [[Montreal Expos]] and five (1985\u201389) with the Mets. The Hall of Fame decided that Carter's impact on the Montreal franchise warranted depicting him with an Expos cap.<ref name=\"MLB-com-Carter\">{{cite web|last=Czerwinski|first=Kevin T.|url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20030116&content_id=191990&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=null|title=Kid catches Cooperstown spotlight: Carter 'happy' to go into Hall as an Expo|date=2012-01-16|accessdate=2003-01-16}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"NewYorker-2016-02-24\">{{cite news\n| title=Hall of Fame Caps That Could Have Been\n| url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/hall-of-fame-caps-that-could-have-been\n| first=Andy | last=Friedman | publisher=[[The New Yorker]] | date=February 24, 2016 | access-date=2018-03-11\n}}\n</ref>\n*'''[[Wade Boggs]]''': Boggs's only championship was as a member of the [[1996 World Series|1996]] New York Yankees, for whom he played from 1993\u201397, but his best career numbers were posted during his eleven years (1982\u201392) wearing the Boston Red Sox uniform. Boggs would eventually be depicted wearing a Boston cap for his 2005 induction.\n*'''[[Andre Dawson]]''': Dawson's cap depicts him as a member of the Expos, his team for eleven years, despite his expressed preference to be shown as a member of the [[Chicago Cubs]].

His greatest successes were with the A's (three pennants and a World Series title in 10 years) and Cardinals (three pennants and two World Series in 16 years).

Maddux believed that both fanbases were equally important in his career, and so the cap on his plaque does not feature any logo.<ref name=\"HoF2014-cap\"/> His biography on the Hall's website lists his primary team as the Braves.\n*'''[[Randy Johnson]]''': Johnson played for six teams in a 22-year career, but spent the bulk of it with the Seattle Mariners (10 seasons) and Arizona Diamondbacks (8 seasons). While enjoying great success with both teams, he had more significant honors with the Diamondbacks. Four of Johnson's five Cy Young Awards (consecutively from 1999 to 2002), his only championship (in [[2001 World Series|2001]]), his pitching triple crown ({{mlby|2002}}), and [[Randy Johnson's perfect game|his perfect game]] ({{mlby|2004}}) all came with the Diamondbacks. Accordingly, he and the Hall agreed his plaque should feature a Diamondbacks logo.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/randy-johnson-cap-selection |title=Cap Selection Announced for Randy Johnson |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |date=January 16, 2015 |accessdate=January 12, 2016}}</ref> His biography on the Hall's website lists his primary team as the Mariners.\n\n==The museum==\nAccording to the Hall of Fame, approximately 300,000 visitors enter the museum each year,<ref name=\"visitors\"/> and the running total has surpassed 14 million.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} These visitors see only a fraction of its 40,000 artifacts, 3 million library items (such as newspaper clippings and photos) and 140,000 baseball cards.<ref name=\"visitors\"/>\n\nThe Hall has seen a noticeable decrease in attendance in recent years. A 2013 story on ''[[ESPN.com]]'' about the village of Cooperstown and its relation to the game partially linked the reduced attendance with Cooperstown Dreams Park, a youth baseball complex about {{convert|5|mi|km}} away in the town of [[Hartwick, New York|Hartwick]]. The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere. According to the story,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/hof13/story/_/id/9508031/life-village-cooperstown|title=Dreams, reality alive in Cooperstown |first=Jim |last=Caple |authorlink=Jim Caple |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=July 26, 2013 |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}</ref><blockquote>Prior to Dreams Park, a room might be filled for a week by several sets of tourists. Now, that room will be taken by just one family for the week, and that family may only go into Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame once. While there are other contributing factors (the [[Great Recession|recession]] and high gas prices among them), the Hall's attendance has tumbled since Dreams Park opened. The Hall drew 383,000 visitors in 1999. It drew 262,000 last year.</blockquote>\n\n===First floor===\n[[File:Baseball Hall of Fame Plaque Gallery.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Commemorative plaque|Plaque]] Gallery in 2001.

It is where the most artifacts are displayed. The Game is set up in a timeline format, starting with baseball's beginnings and culminating with the game we know today. There are several offshoots of this meandering timeline:\n** The '''[[Babe Ruth]] Room'''\n** '''Diamond Dreams''' (women in baseball)\n** '''\u00a1Viva Baseball!''' (a bilingual exhibit, in English and Spanish, that celebrates baseball in Latin America)\n** '''Pride and Passion''' ([[Negro Leagues]] exhibit)\n** '''Taking The Field''' (19th century baseball)\n* '''Whole New Ballgame''', the Museum's newest permanent exhibit, opened in 2015 and is located in the Janetschek Gallery. This exhibit completes the timeline of baseball through the last 45 years into the game we know today. It features environmental video walls and new interactive elements to go along with artifacts from the Museum's collection.\n* The '''Today's Game''' exhibit is built like a baseball clubhouse, with 30 glass-enclosed locker stalls, one for each Major League franchise. In each stall there is a jersey and other items from the designated big league team, along with a brief team history. A center display case holds objects donated to the Hall of Fame from the past year or two. Fans can also look into a room designed to look like a manager's office. Outside is a display case with rotating artifacts. Currently the space is devoted to the [[World Baseball Classic]].\n\n===Third floor===\n* '''Autumn Glory''' is devoted to post-season baseball and has, among other artifacts, replicas of [[World Series ring]]s.\n* '''[[Hank Aaron]]: Chasing the Dream'''\n* A '''theater area''' continually plays the popular [[Abbott and Costello]] routine \"[[Who's on First?]]\" \n* '''One for the Books''' tells the story of baseball's most cherished records through more than 200 artifacts.

The items had been lent to the [[Baseball Commissioner]]'s office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner's office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of [[Joe Reichler]], an assistant to Commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]], who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.<ref name=\"James-HoFItemSale\">{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill James|title=[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?|The Politics of Glory]]|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company|year=1994|location=New York|pages=295\u2013298|isbn=0-02-510774-7}}</ref>\n\n==Non-induction of banned players==\nFollowing the banning of [[Pete Rose]] from MLB, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's \"permanently ineligible\" list, such as Rose or [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]]. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose.\n\nJackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on their own teams\u2014Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to intentionally lose the [[1919 World Series]], and for accepting payment for losing, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his [[My Prison Without Bars|2004 autobiography]]. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer [[Bill James]], though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to \"those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer\".<ref>James (1995:358)</ref>\n\n==United States Mint Coin(s) commemorating the 75th Anniversary==\n[[File:National-baseball-hall-of-fame-2014-us-mint-coins.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Examples of the National Baseball Hall of Fame coins produced by the United States Mint]]\nIn 2012, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed a law ordering the [[United States Mint]] to produce and sell commemorative, non-circulating coins to benefit the private, non-profit Hall.<ref>{{USPL|112|152}}</ref><ref name=\"obama\">{{cite web | url=http://baseballhall.org/news/press-releases/national-baseball-hall-fame-commemorative-coin-act-signed-law-president-obama | title=National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act Signed into Law by President Obama | publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame | work=press release | date=August 3, 2012 | accessdate=June 11, 2014}}</ref> The bill, {{USBill|112|HR|2527}}, was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by Rep.

'''BPP''' also contains '''P''', the class of problems solvable in polynomial time with a deterministic machine, since a deterministic machine is a special case of a probabilistic machine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; text-align:center; margin-left:1em;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| BPP algorithm (1 run)\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|Correct<br />answer|Answer<div style{{=}}\"padding-left:4em;\">produced</div>}}\n! {{yes}}\n! {{no}}\n|-\n! {{yes}}\n| \u2265 2/3\n| \u2264 1/3\n|-\n! {{no}}\n| \u2264 1/3\n| \u2265 2/3\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| BPP algorithm (''k'' runs)\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|Correct<br />answer|<div style{{=}}\"padding-left:4em;\">Answer</div>produced}}\n! {{yes}}\n! {{no}}\n|-\n! {{yes}}\n| > 1 \u2212 2<sup>\u2212''ck''</sup>\n| < 2<sup>\u2212''ck''</sup>\n|-\n! {{no}}\n| < 2<sup>\u2212''ck''</sup>\n| > 1 \u2212 2<sup>\u2212''ck''</sup>\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:85%\"|for some constant ''c'' > 0\n|}\n\nInformally, a problem is in '''BPP''' if there is an algorithm for it that has the following properties:\n*It is allowed to flip coins and make random decisions\n*It is guaranteed to run in polynomial time\n*On any given run of the algorithm, it has a probability of at most 1/3 of giving the wrong answer, whether the answer is YES or NO.\n\n== Definition ==\nA language ''L'' is in '''BPP''' if and only if there exists a probabilistic Turing machine ''M'', such that\n* ''M'' runs for polynomial time on all inputs\n* For all ''x'' in ''L'', ''M'' outputs 1 with probability greater than or equal to {{2/3}}\n* For all ''x'' not in ''L'', ''M'' outputs 1 with probability less than or equal to {{1/3}}\nUnlike the complexity class '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''', the machine ''M'' is required to run for polynomial time on all inputs, regardless of the outcome of the random coin flips.\n\nAlternatively, '''BPP''' can be defined using only deterministic Turing machines. A language ''L'' is in '''BPP''' if and only if there exists a polynomial ''p'' and deterministic Turing machine ''M'', such that\n* ''M'' runs for polynomial time on all inputs\n* For all ''x'' in ''L'', the fraction of strings ''y'' of length ''p''(|''x''|) which satisfy {{tmath|1=M(x,y) = 1}} is greater than or equal to {{2/3}}\n* For all ''x'' not in ''L'', the fraction of strings ''y'' of length ''p''(|''x''|) which satisfy {{tmath|1=M(x,y) = 1}} is less than or equal to {{1/3}}\nIn this definition, the string ''y'' corresponds to the output of the random coin flips that the probabilistic Turing machine would have made. For some applications this definition is preferable since it does not mention probabilistic Turing machines.\n\nIn practice, an error probability of {{1/3}} might not be acceptable, however, the choice of {{1/3}} in the definition is arbitrary. It can be any [[mathematical constant|constant]] between 0 and {{1/2}} (exclusive) and the set '''BPP''' will be unchanged. It does not even have to be constant: the same class of problems is defined by allowing error as high as {{1/2}} \u2212 ''n''<sup>\u2212''c''</sup> on the one hand, or requiring error as small as 2<sup>\u2212''n<sup>c</sup>''</sup> on the other hand, where ''c'' is any positive constant, and ''n'' is the length of input. The idea is that there is a probability of error, but if the algorithm is run many times, the chance that the majority of the runs are wrong [[exponential decay|drops off exponentially]] as a consequence of the [[Chernoff bound]].<ref>Valentine Kabanets, [http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~kabanets/cmpt710/lec16.pdf CMPT 710 - Complexity Theory: Lecture 16], October 28, 2003</ref> This makes it possible to create a highly accurate algorithm by merely running the algorithm several times and taking a \"majority vote\" of the answers. For example, if one defined the class with the restriction that the algorithm can be wrong with probability at most {{frac|1|2<sup>100</sup>}}, this would result in the same class of problems.\n\n== Problems ==\n{{unsolved|computer science|{{tmath|1= \\mathsf P \\overset{?}{=} \\mathsf{BPP} }}}}\nBesides the problems in '''P''', which are obviously in '''BPP''', many problems were known to be in '''BPP''' but not known to be in '''P'''. The number of such problems is decreasing, and it is conjectured that '''P''' = '''BPP'''.\n\nFor a long time, one of the most famous problems that was known to be in '''BPP''' but not known to be in '''P''' was the problem of [[primality test|determining]] whether a given number is [[prime number|prime]]. However, in the 2002 paper ''[[AKS primality test|PRIMES is in '''P''']]'', [[Manindra Agrawal]] and his students [[Neeraj Kayal]] and [[Nitin Saxena]] found a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, thus showing that it is in '''P'''.\n\nAn important example of a problem in '''BPP''' (in fact in '''[[RP (complexity)|co-RP]]''') still not known to be in '''P''' is [[polynomial identity testing]], the problem of determining whether a polynomial is identically equal to the zero polynomial, when you have access to the value of the polynomial for any given input, but not to the coefficients. In other words, is there an assignment of values to the variables such that when a nonzero polynomial is evaluated on these values, the result is nonzero? It suffices to choose each variable's value uniformly at random from a finite subset of at least ''d'' values to achieve bounded error probability, where ''d'' is the total degree of the polynomial.<ref>Madhu Sudan and Shien Jin Ong.

February 26, 2003.</ref>\n\n== Related classes ==\nIf the access to randomness is removed from the definition of '''BPP''', we get the complexity class '''P'''. In the definition of the class, if we replace the ordinary [[Turing machine]] with a [[quantum computer]], we get the class '''[[BQP]]'''.\n\nAdding [[postselection]] to '''BPP''', or allowing computation paths to have different lengths, gives the class '''BPP'''<sub>path</sub>.<ref>[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:B#bpppath BPPpath] in [https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo Complexity Zoo]</ref> '''BPP'''<sub>path</sub> is known to contain '''NP''', and it is contained in its quantum counterpart '''[[PostBQP]]'''.\n\nA [[Monte Carlo algorithm]] is a [[randomized algorithm]] which is likely to be correct. Problems in the class '''BPP''' have Monte Carlo algorithms with polynomial bounded running time. This is compared to a [[Las Vegas algorithm]] which is a randomized algorithm which either outputs the correct answer, or outputs \"fail\" with low probability. Las Vegas algorithms with polynomial bound running times are used to define the class '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]'''. Alternatively, '''ZPP''' contains probabilistic algorithms that are always correct and have expected polynomial running time. This is weaker than saying it is a polynomial time algorithm, since it may run for super-polynomial time, but with very low probability.\n\n== Complexity-theoretic properties ==\n[[File:Randomized Complexity Classes.svg|thumb|BPP in relation to other probabilistic complexity classes]]\n\nIt is known that '''BPP''' is closed under [[Complement (complexity)|complement]]; that is, '''BPP''' = '''co-BPP'''. '''BPP''' is [[low (complexity)|low]] for itself, meaning that a '''BPP''' machine with the power to solve '''BPP''' problems instantly (a '''BPP''' [[oracle machine]]) is not any more powerful than the machine without this extra power. In symbols, '''BPP'''<sup>'''BPP'''</sup> = '''BPP'''.\n\nThe relationship between '''BPP''' and '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is unknown: it is not known whether '''BPP''' is a [[subset]] of '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''', '''NP''' is a subset of '''BPP''' or neither. If '''NP''' is contained in '''BPP''', which is considered unlikely since it would imply practical solutions for [[NP-complete]] problems, then '''NP''' = '''RP''' and '''[[PH (complexity)|PH]]''' \u2286 '''BPP'''.<ref> Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch, [http://weblog.fortnow.com/2005/12/pulling-out-quantumness.html Pulling Out The Quantumness],  December 20, 2005</ref>\n\nIt is known that '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' is a subset of '''BPP''', and '''BPP''' is a subset of '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]'''.  It is not known whether those two are strict subsets, since we don't even know if '''P''' is a strict subset of '''PSPACE'''. '''BPP''' is contained in the second level of the [[polynomial hierarchy]] and therefore it is contained in '''PH'''. More precisely, the [[Sipser\u2013Lautemann theorem]] states that <math>\\mathsf{BPP} \\subseteq \\Sigma_2 \\cap \\Pi_2 </math>. As a result, '''P''' = '''NP''' leads to '''P''' = '''BPP''' since '''PH''' collapses to '''P''' in this case. Thus either '''P''' = '''BPP''' or '''P''' \u2260 '''NP''' or both.\n\n[[Adleman's theorem]] states that membership in any language in '''BPP''' can be determined by a family of polynomial-size [[Boolean circuit]]s, which means '''BPP''' is contained in '''[[P/poly]]'''.<ref>{{cite conference | author = [[Leonard Adleman|Adleman, L.

For a fixed [[E (complexity)|E]]<sup>NP</sup> (relativized) complete problem, the oracle will give correct answers with high probability if queried with the problem instance followed by a random string of length ''kn'' (''n'' is instance length; ''k'' is an appropriate small constant).  Start with ''n''=1.  For every instance of the problem of length ''n'' fix oracle answers (see lemma below) to fix the instance output.  Next, provide the instance outputs for queries consisting of the instance followed by ''kn''-length string, and then treat output for queries of length \u2264(''k''+1)''n'' as fixed, and proceed with instances of length ''n''+1.\n\n'''Lemma:''' Given a problem (specifically, an oracle machine code and time constraint) in relativized E<sup>NP</sup>, for every partially constructed oracle and input of length ''n'', the output can be fixed by specifying 2<sup>''O''(''n'')</sup> oracle answers.<br/>\n'''Proof:''' The machine is simulated, and the oracle answers (that are not already fixed) are fixed step-by-step.  There is at most one oracle query per deterministic computation step.  For the relativized NP oracle, if possible fix the output to be yes by choosing a computation path and fixing the answers of the base oracle; otherwise no fixing is necessary, and either way there is at most 1 answer of the base oracle per step.  Since there are 2<sup>''O''(''n'')</sup> steps, the lemma follows.\n\nThe lemma ensures that (for a large enough ''k''), it is possible to do the construction while leaving enough strings for the relativized E<sup>NP</sup> answers.  Also, we can ensure that for the relativized E<sup>NP</sup>, linear time suffices, even for function problems (if given a function oracle and linear output size) and with exponentially small (with linear exponent) error probability.  Also, this construction is effective in that given an arbitrary oracle A we can arrange the oracle B to have P<sup>A</sup>\u2264P<sup>B</sup> and EXP<sup>NP<sup>A</sup></sup>=EXP<sup>NP<sup>B</sup></sup>=BPP<sup>B</sup>.  Also, for a [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]=EXP oracle (and hence ZPP=BPP=EXP&lt;NEXP), one would fix the answers in the relativized E computation to a special nonanswer, thus ensuring that no fake answers are given.\n\n== Derandomization ==\nThe existence of certain strong [[pseudorandom number generators]] is [[conjecture]]d by most experts of the field. This conjecture implies that randomness does not give additional computational power to polynomial time computation, that is, '''P''' = '''RP''' = '''BPP'''. Note that ordinary generators are not sufficient to show this result; any probabilistic algorithm implemented using a typical random number generator will always produce incorrect results on certain inputs irrespective of the seed (though these inputs might be rare).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n[[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai]], [[Lance Fortnow]], [[Noam Nisan]], and [[Avi Wigderson]] showed that unless '''[[EXPTIME]]''' collapses to '''[[MA (complexity)|MA]]''', '''BPP''' is contained in<ref name=\"Babai\">{{cite journal | last1 = Babai | first1 = L\u00e1szl\u00f3 | last2 = Fortnow | first2 = Lance | last3 = Nisan | first3 = Noam | last4 = Wigderson | first4 = Avi | year = 1993 | title = '''BPP''' has subexponential time simulations unless '''EXPTIME''' has publishable proofs | url = | journal = Computational Complexity | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 307\u2013318 | doi=10.1007/bf01275486}}</ref> \n:<math>\\textsf{i.o.-SUBEXP} = \\bigcap\\nolimits_{\\varepsilon>0} \\textsf{i.o.-DTIME} \\left (2^{n^\\varepsilon} \\right).</math> \nThe class '''i.o.-SUBEXP''', which stands for infinitely often '''SUBEXP''', contains problems which have [[sub-exponential time]] algorithms for infinitely many input sizes.

For example, algorithms are known for factoring an ''n''-bit integer using just over 2''n'' qubits ([[Shor's algorithm]]).\n\nUsually, computation on a quantum computer ends with a [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]]. This leads to a [[Wavefunction collapse|collapse]] of quantum state to one of the [[Quantum state|basis states]]. It can be said that the quantum state is measured to be in the correct state with high probability.\n\nQuantum computers have gained widespread interest because some problems of practical interest are known to be in '''BQP''', but suspected to be outside '''P'''.

W. Jeter]]. It is a continuation of both the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and the novel upon which the film was based, [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''\n\n==Plot==\nSeveral months after the events depicted in ''Blade Runner'', Deckard has retired to an isolated shack outside the city, taking the replicant Rachael with him in a Tyrell transport container, which slows down the replicant aging process. He is approached by a woman who explains she is Sarah Tyrell, niece of Eldon Tyrell, heiress to the Tyrell Corporation and the human template (\"templant\") for the Rachael replicant. She asks Deckard to hunt down the \"missing\" sixth replicant. At the same time, the templant for Roy Batty hires Dave Holden, the blade runner attacked by Leon, to help him hunt down the man he believes is the sixth replicant\u2014Deckard.\n\nDeckard and Holden's investigations lead them to re-visit Sebastian, Bryant, and John Isidore (from the book ''Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?''), learning more about the nature of the blade runners and the replicants.\n\nWhen Deckard, Batty, and Holden finally clash, Batty's super-human fighting prowess leads Holden to believe he has been duped all along and that Batty is the sixth replicant. He shoots him. Deckard returns to Sarah with his suspicion: there is ''no'' sixth replicant. Sarah, speaking via a remote camera, confesses that she invented and maintained the rumor herself in order to deliberately discredit and eventually destroy the Tyrell Corporation because her uncle Eldon had based Rachel on her and then abandoned the real Sarah. Sarah brings Rachael back to the Corporation to meet with Deckard, and they escape.\n\nHowever, Holden, recovering from his injuries during the fight, later uncovers the truth: Rachael has been killed by Tyrell agents, and the \"Rachael\" who escaped with Deckard was actually Sarah. She has completed her revenge by both destroying Tyrell and taking back Rachael's place.\n\n==Characters==\n*Rick Deckard: The Tyrell Corporation finally locates him, residing at a cabin in the woods with the frozen Rachael. In exchange for getting Rachael back, Deckard agrees to hunt the missing sixth replicant.\n*Roy Batty: The man which Tyrell used as the template for his combat replicants is in fact a man of considerable instability, suffering from a brain disorder that prevents him from experiencing fear.\n*Sarah Tyrell: The niece of Eldon Tyrell, Sarah locates and hires Deckard to eliminate the final replicant in order to retain her corporation's hold over the market.\n*Dave Holden: Starting off bed-ridden after his attack by the replicant Leon, Holden is rescued by Roy who in turn leads him to some startling revelations.\n*J.R. Isidore: A lowly employee of a vet's office, Isidore also works as an underground replicant sympathizer, having made modifications to replicants in order to help them escape detection.\n\n==Relationship to other works==\nThe book's plot draws from other material related to ''Blade Runner'' in a number of ways:\n* Deckard, Pris, Sebastian, Leon, Batty, and Holden all appeared in ''Blade Runner''.\n* Many of the parts of the \"conspiracy\" are based on errors or plot holes identified by fans of the original movie, such as Leon's ability to bring a gun into the Tyrell building, or the reference to the sixth replicant.\n* The character of John Isidore, and his \"pet hospital\", is taken from Dick's original novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', although that book contained no suggestion that the shop ran a sideline in modifying replicants.\n* ''Blade Runner''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Sebastian was based on ''Electric Sheep''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Isidore, though Jeter features them as separate characters in ''The Edge of Human''.\n* The idea of replicant models being mass-produced, and in particular a woman identical to Rachael existing, is also from ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?''; although in that book, Pris was the replicant double of Rachael, and there was no suggestion that replicants were constructed based on human templates.\n* The etymology of the term \"blade runner\" is revealed to come from the German phrase ''bleib ruhig'', meaning \"remain calm.\" It was supposedly developed by the Tyrell Corporation to prevent news about replicants malfunctioning.\n\nHowever, it also contradicts material in some ways:\n* Sebastian was stated as being dead in the movie, yet he is alive in ''The Edge of Human''.\n* Pris was clearly stated as being a replicant in both the movie and the original novel, yet ''The Edge of Human'' claims she was human.\n* Pris was clearly destroyed by Deckard in both the movie and the original novel. Sebastian's ability to bring Pris back to life as a replicant introduces numerous problems: the book implies that Sebastian was able to do this without realising that her original body was human. It is likewise unclear why Deckard would have left her, or any suspected replicant he retired, in a state from which they could be repaired.\n* \"The Final Cut\" of ''Blade Runner'' removed the reference of a surviving sixth replicant, as it was normally considered a leftover from an early script.\n\n==Reception==\nMichael Giltz of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the book a \"C-\", feeling that \"only hardcore fans will be satisfied by this tale\" and saying that Jeter's \"habit of echoing dialogue and scenes from the film is annoying and begs comparisons he would do well to avoid.\"<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299536,00.html Review] Michael Giltz, ''Entertainment Weekly'', Nov 17, 1995</ref> Tal Cohen of ''Tal Cohen's Bookshelf'' called ''The Edge of Human'' \"a good book\", praising Jeter's \"further, and deeper, investigation of the questions Philip K.

Today, it is the world's largest Amiga archive, known as [[Aminet]].\n\nM\u00fcller designed Brainfuck with the goal of implementing it with the smallest possible [[compiler]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/ |title=The Brainfuck Programming Language |publisher=Muppetlabs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}</ref> inspired by the 1024-byte compiler for the [[Esoteric programming language#FALSE|FALSE programming language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strlen.com/false/index.html |title=Wouter's Wiki : False Language |publisher=Strlen.com |date=2013-08-03 |accessdate=2013-10-30}}</ref> M\u00fcller's original compiler was implemented in machine language and compiled to a binary with a size of 296 bytes. He uploaded the first Brainfuck compiler to Aminet in 1993. The program came with a \"Readme\" file, which briefly described the language, and challenged the reader \"Who can program anything useful with it? [[Emoticon|:)]]\". M\u00fcller also included an interpreter and some quite elaborate examples. A second version of the compiler used only 240 bytes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aminet.net/package.php?package=dev/lang/brainfuck-2.lha |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051106213924/http://www.aminet.net/package.php?package=dev/lang/brainfuck-2.lha |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-11-06 |title=dev/lang/brainfuck-2.lha |publisher=Aminet |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30 }}</ref>\n\nAs Aminet grew, the compiler became popular among the Amiga community, and in time it was implemented for other platforms. Several brainfuck compilers have been made smaller than 200 bytes, and one is only 100 bytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/peterferrie/brainfuck |title=BRAINFCK IN 100 BYTES! |publisher=github.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref>\n\n=== P\u2032\u2032 Brainfuck's formal \"parent language\" ===\nExcept for its two I/O commands, Brainfuck is a minor variation of the formal programming language [[P\u2032\u2032]] created by [[Corrado B\u00f6hm]] in 1964, which in turn is explicitly based on the [[Turing machine]].  In fact, using six symbols equivalent to the respective Brainfuck commands <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code><</code>, <code>></code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, B\u00f6hm provided an explicit program for each of the basic functions that together serve to compute any [[computable function]].  So the first \"Brainfuck\" programs appear in B\u00f6hm's 1964 paper &ndash; and they were programs sufficient to prove [[Turing completeness]].\n\n=== The Infinite Abacus : Brainfuck's \"grand-parent\" language ===\nA version with explicit memory addressing rather without stack and a conditional jump was introduced by [[Joachim Lambek]] in 1961 under the name of the Infinite Abacus <ref name=\"lambek\">{{cite web |url=https://cms.math.ca/10.4153/CMB-1961-032-6|title=How to program an infinite abacus|author=J.

Melzac, whose [[one instruction set computer]] is obviously equivalent to an Infinite Abacus, gives programs for multiplication, gcd, n<sup>t</sup> prime number, representation in base b, sorting by magnitude, shows how to simulate an arbitrary Turing machine.\n\nIt would not be difficult to replace the direct memory addressing by a stack and two instructions '<' and '>'.\n\n==Language design==\nThe language consists of eight [[command (computing)|command]]s, listed below. A brainfuck program is a sequence of these commands, possibly interspersed with other characters (which are ignored). The commands are executed sequentially, with some exceptions: an [[Program Counter|instruction pointer]] begins at the first command, and each command it points to is executed, after which it normally moves forward to the next command. The program terminates when the instruction pointer moves past the last command.\n\nThe brainfuck language uses a simple machine model consisting of the program and instruction pointer, as well as an array of at least 30,000 [[byte]] cells initialized to zero; a movable [[pointer (computer programming)|data pointer]] (initialized to point to the leftmost byte of the array); and two streams of bytes for input and output (most often connected to a keyboard and a monitor respectively, and using the [[ASCII]] character encoding).\n\n===Commands===\nThe eight language commands each consist of a single character:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Character\n!align=\"left\"|Meaning\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<code>&gt;</code>\n||increment the [[pointer (computer programming)|data pointer]] (to point to the next cell to the right).\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<code>&lt;</code>\n||decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<code>+</code>\n||increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<code>-</code>\n||decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<code>.</code>\n||output the byte at the data pointer.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<code>,</code>\n||accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<code>[</code>\n||if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the [[Program Counter|instruction pointer]] forward to the next command, [[Branch (computer science)|jump]] it ''forward'' to the command after the ''matching'' <code>]</code> command.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<code>]</code>\n||if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it ''back'' to the command after the ''matching'' <code>[</code> command.\n|}\n\n(Alternatively, the <code>]</code> command may instead be translated as an unconditional jump '''to''' the corresponding <code>[</code> command, or vice versa; programs will behave the same but will run more slowly, due to unnecessary double searching.)\n\n<code>[</code> and <code>]</code> match as parentheses usually do: each <code>[</code> matches exactly one <code>]</code> and vice versa, the <code>[</code> comes first, and there can be no unmatched <code>[</code> or <code>]</code> between the two.\n\nBrainfuck programs can be translated into [[C (programming language)|C]] using the following substitutions, assuming <code>ptr</code> is of type <code> char*</code> and has been initialized to point to an array of zeroed bytes:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|brainfuck command\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[C (programming language)|C]] equivalent\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|(Program Start) || {{c-lang|1=char array[INFINITELY_LARGE_SIZE] = {0};}}<br />{{c-lang|1=char *ptr=array;}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<code>&gt;</code> || {{c-lang|1=++ptr;}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<code>&lt;</code> || {{c-lang|1=--ptr;}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<code>+</code> || {{c-lang|1=++*ptr;}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<code>-</code> || {{c-lang|1=--*ptr;}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<code>.</code> || {{c-lang|1=putchar(*ptr);}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<code>,</code> || {{c-lang|1=*ptr=getchar();}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<code>[</code> || {{c-lang|1=while (*ptr) {}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<code>]</code> || {{c-lang|1={{)}}}}\n|}\n\nAs the name suggests, brainfuck programs tend to be difficult to comprehend. This is partly because any mildly complex task requires a long sequence of commands; partly it is because the program's text gives no direct indications of the program's [[state (computer science)|state]]. These, as well as brainfuck's inefficiency and its limited input/output capabilities, are some of the reasons it is not used for serious programming. Nonetheless, like any Turing complete language, brainfuck is theoretically capable of computing any computable function or simulating any other computational model, if given access to an unlimited amount of memory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwriteiam.nl/Ha_bf_Turing.html |title=BF is Turing-complete |publisher=Iwriteiam.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}</ref> A variety of brainfuck programs have been written.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/bf-source/prog/ |title=Index of /brainfuck/bf-source/prog |publisher=Esoteric.sange.fi |date=2002-01-22 |accessdate=2013-10-30}}</ref> Although brainfuck programs, especially complicated ones, are difficult to write, it is quite trivial to write an interpreter for brainfuck in a more typical language such as C due to its simplicity.

This sequence is repeated until the starting cell is 0.\n\n<source lang=\"bf\">\n[->+<]\n</source>\n\nThis can be incorporated into a simple addition program as follows:\n\n<source lang=\"bf\">\n++       Cell c0 = 2\n> +++++  Cell c1 = 5\n\n[        Start your loops with your cell pointer on the loop counter (c1 in our case)\n< +      Add 1 to c0\n> -      Subtract 1 from c1\n]        End your loops with the cell pointer on the loop counter\n\nAt this point our program has added 5 to 2 leaving 7 in c0 and 0 in c1\nbut we cannot output this value to the terminal since it is not ASCII encoded!\n\nTo display the ASCII character \"7\" we must add 48 to the value 7\n48 = 6 * 8 so let's use another loop to help us!\n\n++++ ++++  c1 = 8 and this will be our loop counter again\n[\n< +++ +++  Add 6 to c0\n> -        Subtract 1 from c1\n]\n< .        Print out c0 which has the value 55 which translates to \"7\"!\n</source>\n\n=== Hello World! ===\nThe following program prints [[Hello world program|\"Hello World!\"]] and a newline to the screen:\n\n<source lang=\"bf\">\n[ This program prints \"Hello World!\" and a newline to the screen, its\n  length is 106 active command characters. [It is not the shortest.]\n\n  This loop is an \"initial comment loop\", a simple way of adding a comment\n  to a BF program such that you don't have to worry about any command\n  characters. Any \".\", \",\", \"+\", \"-\", \"<\" and \">\" characters are simply\n  ignored, the \"[\" and \"]\" characters just have to be balanced. This\n  loop and the commands it contains are ignored because the current cell\n  defaults to a value of 0; the 0 value causes this loop to be skipped.\n]\n++++++++               Set Cell #0 to 8\n[\n    >++++               Add 4 to Cell #1; this will always set Cell #1 to 4\n    [                   as the cell will be cleared by the loop\n        >++             Add 2 to Cell #2\n        >+++            Add 3 to Cell #3\n        >+++            Add 3 to Cell #4\n        >+              Add 1 to Cell #5\n        <<<<-           Decrement the loop counter in Cell #1\n    ]                   Loop till Cell #1 is zero; number of iterations is 4\n    >+                  Add 1 to Cell #2\n    >+                  Add 1 to Cell #3\n    >-                  Subtract 1 from Cell #4\n    >>+                 Add 1 to Cell #6\n    [<]                 Move back to the first zero cell you find; this will\n                        be Cell #1 which was cleared by the previous loop\n    <-                  Decrement the loop Counter in Cell #0\n]                       Loop till Cell #0 is zero; number of iterations is 8\n\nThe result of this is:\nCell No :   0   1   2   3   4   5   6\nContents:   0   0  72 104  88  32   8\nPointer :   ^\n\n>>.

And finally a newline from Cell #6\n</source>\n\nFor \"readability\", this code has been spread across many lines and blanks and comments have been added. Brainfuck ignores all characters except the eight commands <code>+-<>[],.</code> so no special syntax for comments is needed (as long as the comments do not contain the command characters). The code could just as well have been written as:\n<source lang=\"bf\">++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.</source>\n\n=== ROT13 ===\nThis program enciphers its input with the [[ROT13]] cipher. To do this, it must map characters A-M ([[ASCII]] 65-77) to N-Z (78-90), and vice versa. Also it must map a-m (97-109) to n-z (110-122) and vice versa. It must map all other characters to themselves; it reads characters one at a time and outputs their enciphered equivalents until it reads an EOF (here assumed to be represented as either -1 or \"no change\"), at which point the program terminates.\n\nThe basic approach used is as follows. Calling the input character ''x'', divide ''x''-1 by 32, keeping quotient and remainder. Unless the quotient is 2 or 3, just output ''x'', having kept a copy of it during the division. If the quotient is 2 or 3, divide the remainder ((''x''-1) modulo 32) by 13; if the quotient here is 0, output ''x''+13; if 1, output ''x''-13; if 2, output ''x''.\n\nRegarding the division algorithm, when dividing ''y'' by ''z'' to get a quotient ''q'' and remainder ''r'', there is an outer loop which sets ''q'' and ''r'' first to the quotient and remainder of 1/''z'', then to those of 2/''z'', and so on; after it has executed ''y'' times, this outer loop terminates, leaving ''q'' and ''r'' set to the quotient and remainder of ''y''/''z''. (The dividend ''y'' is used as a diminishing counter that controls how many times this loop is executed.) Within the loop, there is code to increment ''r'' and decrement ''y'', which is usually sufficient; however, every ''z''th time through the outer loop, it is necessary to zero ''r'' and increment ''q''. This is done with a diminishing counter set to the divisor ''z''; each time through the outer loop, this counter is decremented, and when it reaches zero, it is refilled by moving the value from ''r'' back into it.\n\n<source lang=\"bf\"> \n-,+[                         Read first character and start outer character reading loop\n    -[                       Skip forward if character is 0\n        >>++++[>++++++++<-]  Set up divisor (32) for division loop\n                               (MEMORY LAYOUT: dividend copy remainder divisor quotient zero zero)\n        <+<-[                Set up dividend (x minus 1) and enter division loop\n            >+>+>-[>>>]      Increase copy and remainder / reduce divisor / Normal case: skip forward\n            <[[>+<-]>>+>]    Special case: move remainder back to divisor and increase quotient\n            <<<<<-           Decrement dividend\n        ]                    End division loop\n    ]>>>[-]+                 End skip loop; zero former divisor and reuse space for a flag\n    >--[-[<->+++[-]]]<[         Zero that flag unless quotient was 2 or 3; zero quotient; check flag\n        ++++++++++++<[       If flag then set up divisor (13) for second division loop\n                               (MEMORY LAYOUT: zero copy dividend divisor remainder quotient zero zero)\n            >-[>+>>]         Reduce divisor; Normal case: increase remainder\n            >[+[<+>-]>+>>]   Special case: increase remainder / move it back to divisor / increase quotient\n            <<<<<-           Decrease dividend\n        ]                    End division loop\n        >>[<+>-]             Add remainder back to divisor to get a useful 13\n        >[                   Skip forward if quotient was 0\n            -[               Decrement quotient and skip forward if quotient was 1\n                -<<[-]>>     Zero quotient and divisor if quotient was 2\n            ]<<[<<->>-]>>    Zero divisor and subtract 13 from copy if quotient was 1\n        ]<<[<<+>>-]          Zero divisor and add 13 to copy if quotient was 0\n    ]                        End outer skip loop (jump to here if ((character minus 1)/32) was not 2 or 3)\n    <[-]                     Clear remainder from first division if second division was skipped\n    <.[-]                    Output ROT13ed character from copy and clear it\n    <-,+                     Read next character\n]                            End character reading loop\n</source>\n\n===Subtract 2 numbers===\n<source lang=\"bf\">\n +++++>+++[-<->]<.\n</source>\n\n===Multiply 2 numbers===\n<source lang=\"bf\">\n +++++[->+++<]>.\n</source>\n\n===Divide 2 numbers===\n<source lang=\"bf\">\n ++++++++++++[--->+<]>.\n</source>\n\n===Truth-Machine===\n<source lang=\"bf\">\n,[.-[-->++<]>+]\n</source>\n\n==Portability issues==\n\nPartly because Urban M\u00fcller did not write a thorough language specification, the many subsequent brainfuck interpreters and compilers have come to use slightly different dialects of brainfuck.\n\n===Cell size===\nIn the classic distribution, the cells are of 8-bit size (cells are bytes), and this is still the most common size. However, to read non-textual data, a brainfuck program may need to distinguish an [[end-of-file]] condition from any possible byte value; thus 16-bit cells have also been used. Some implementations have used 32-bit cells, 64-bit cells, or [[bignum]] cells with practically unlimited range, but programs that use this extra range are likely to be slow, since storing the value ''n'' into a cell requires [[Big O notation#Related asymptotic notations|\u03a9]](''n'') time as a cell's value may only be changed by incrementing and decrementing.\n\nIn all these variants, the <code>,</code> and <code>.</code> commands still read and write data in bytes. In most of them, the cells wrap around, i.e. incrementing a cell which holds its maximal value (with the <code>+</code> command) will bring it to its minimal value and vice versa. The exceptions are implementations which are distant from the underlying hardware, implementations that use bignums, and implementations that try to enforce portability.\n\nIt is usually easy to write brainfuck programs that do not ever cause integer wraparound or overflow, and therefore don't depend on cell size. Generally this means avoiding increment of +255 (unsigned 8-bit wraparound), or avoiding overstepping the boundaries of [-128, +127] (signed 8-bit wraparound) (since there are no comparison operators, a program cannot distinguish between a signed and unsigned [[two's complement]] fixed-bit-size cell and negativeness of numbers is a matter of interpretation). For more details on integer wraparound, see the [[Integer overflow]] article.\n\n===Array size===\nIn the classic distribution, the array has 30,000 cells, and the pointer begins at the leftmost cell. Even more cells are needed to store things like the millionth [[Fibonacci number]], and the easiest way to make the language Turing complete is to make the array unlimited on the right.\n\nA few implementations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kiyuko.org/software/beef |title=Beef \u2013 |last1=Bolognani |first=Andrea |publisher=Kiyuko.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}</ref> extend the array to the left as well; this is an uncommon feature, and therefore portable brainfuck programs do not depend on it.\n\nWhen the pointer moves outside the bounds of the array, some implementations will give an error message, some will try to extend the array dynamically, some will not notice and will produce [[undefined behavior]], and a few will move the pointer to the opposite end of the array. Some tradeoffs are involved: expanding the array dynamically to the right is the most user-friendly approach and is good for memory-hungry programs, but it carries a speed penalty. If a fixed-size array is used it is helpful to make it very large, or better yet let the user set the size. Giving an error message for bounds violations is very useful for debugging but even that carries a speed penalty unless it can be handled by the operating system's memory protections.\n\n===End-of-line code===\nDifferent operating systems (and sometimes different programming environments) use subtly different versions of ASCII. The most important difference is in the code used for the end of a line of text. MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows use a [[Newline#Representations|CRLF]], i.e. a 13 followed by a 10, in most contexts. UNIX and its descendants (including GNU/Linux and Mac OS X) and Amigas use just 10, and older Macs use just 13. It would be difficult if brainfuck programs had to be rewritten for different operating systems. However, a unified standard was easy to create. Urban M\u00fcller's compiler and his example programs use 10, on both input and output; so do a large majority of existing brainfuck programs; and 10 is also more convenient to use than CRLF. Thus, brainfuck implementations should make sure that brainfuck programs that assume newline=10 will run properly; many do so, but some do not.\n\nThis assumption is also consistent with most of the world's sample code for [[C (programming language)|C]] and other languages, in that they use '\\n', or 10, for their newlines. On systems that use CRLF line endings, the C standard library transparently remaps \"\\n\" to \"\\r\\n\" on output and \"\\r\\n\" to \"\\n\" on input for streams not opened in binary mode.\n\n===End-of-file behavior===\nThe behavior of the \"<code>,</code>\" command when an [[end-of-file]] condition has been encountered varies. Some implementations set the cell at the pointer to 0, some set it to the C constant EOF (in practice this is usually -1), some leave the cell's value unchanged. There is no real consensus; arguments for the three behaviors are as follows.\n\nSetting the cell to 0 avoids the use of negative numbers, and makes it marginally more concise to write a loop that reads characters until EOF occurs. This is a language extension devised by Panu Kalliokoski.\n\nSetting the cell to -1 allows EOF to be distinguished from any byte value (if the cells are larger than bytes), which is necessary for reading non-textual data; also, it is the behavior of the C translation of \"<code>,</code>\" given in M\u00fcller's readme file. However, it is not obvious that those C translations are to be taken as normative.\n\nLeaving the cell's value unchanged is the behavior of Urban M\u00fcller's brainfuck compiler. This behavior can easily coexist with either of the others; for instance, a program that assumes EOF=0 can set the cell to 0 before each \"<code>,</code>\" command, and will then work correctly on implementations that do either EOF=0 or EOF=\"no change\". It is so easy to accommodate the \"no change\" behavior that any brainfuck programmer interested in portability should do so.\n\n== Derivatives ==\nMany people have created brainfuck equivalents (languages with commands that directly map to brainfuck) or brainfuck derivatives (languages that extend its behavior or map it into new semantic territory).\n\nSome examples:\n* '''Pi''', which maps brainfuck into errors in individual digits of [[Pi]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=Can find mention only in an esolangs.org Wiki, which only references one webpage, which in turn says it is copied from the Wiki}}\n* '''VerboseFuck''', which looks like a traditional programming language, only what appears as parameters or expressions are actually parts of longer commands that cannot be altered.{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=This seems to be something someone just made up as a joke last month, not mentioned in any independent reliable source.}}\n* '''DerpPlusPlus''', in which the commands are replaced with words such as 'HERP', 'DERP', 'GIGITY', etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/TheRaz/DerpPlusPlus|title=TheRaz/DerpPlusPlus|publisher=Github.com|accessdate=2015-04-08}}</ref>\n* '''Ook!''', which maps brainfuck's eight commands to two-word combinations of \"Ook.\", \"Ook?\", and \"Ook!\", jokingly designed to be \"writable and readable by orang-utans\" according to its creator, a reference to [[The Librarian (Discworld)#Librarian|the orang-utan Librarian]] in the novels of [[Terry Pratchett]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/ook.html|title=Ook!|work=DM's Esoteric Programming Languages|first=David|last=Morgan-Mar|date=2009-03-21|accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref><ref name=\"Paloque-Berg\u00e8s2009\">{{cite book|last=Paloque-Berg\u00e8s|first=Camille|title=Po\u00e9tique des codes sur le r\u00e9seau informatique|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQt00bhlSqsC&pg=PA73|year=2009|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions des archives contemporaines]]|isbn=978-2-914610-70-4|page=73|location=Paris|language=French}}</ref>\n* '''Ternary''', similar in concept to Ook!

He studied under [[Baccio Bandinelli]] and [[Jacopo Sansovino]] (assisting on the design of the Library of St. Mark's, the ''[[Biblioteca Marciana]]'', Venice) and closely imitated the style of [[Michelangelo]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHe was more distinguished in architecture than in sculpture. He worked in [[Rome]] in collaboration with [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola|Vignola]] and [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]]),<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> including designs for the [[Villa Giulia]], but also for works and at [[Lucca]].  He labored during 1558\u20131570, in the refurbishment and enlargement of [[Pitti Palace]], creating the courtyard consisting of three wings with rusticated facades, and one lower portico leading to the amphitheatre in the Boboli Gardens. His design mirrored the appearance of the main external fa\u00e7ade of Pitti. He was also named ''Consul'' of [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]] of Florence, which had been founded by the Duke Cosimo I in 1563.\n[[File:Boboli-gardens-from-palazzo.jpg|thumb|Garden entrance of the Ammannati Courtyard in the Pitti Palace.]]\n\nIn 1569, Ammanati was commissioned to build the [[Ponte Santa Trinita]], a bridge over the Arno River. The three arches are elliptic, and though very light and elegant, has survived, when floods had damaged other Arno bridges at different times.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Santa Trinita was destroyed in 1944, during World War II, and rebuilt in 1957.\n\nAmmannati designed what is considered a prototypic [[mannerist]] sculptural ensemble in the ''[[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]]'' (''Fontana del Nettuno''), prominently located in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in the center of Florence.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The assignment was originally given to the aged [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli]]; however when Bandinelli died, Ammannati's design, bested the submissions of [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and [[Vincenzo Danti]], to gain the commission. From 1563 and 1565, Ammannati and his assistants, among them [[Giambologna]], sculpted the block of marble that had been chosen by Bandinelli. He took Grand Duke [[Cosimo I]] as model for Neptune's face. The statue was meant to highlight Cosimo's goal of establishing a Florentine Naval force. The ungainly sea god was placed at the corner of the Palazzo Vecchio within sight of Michelangelo\u2019s David statue, and the then 87-year-old sculptor is said to have scoffed at Ammannati\u2014 saying that he had ruined a beautiful piece of marble\u2014 with the ditty: \"Ammannati, Ammanato, che bel marmo hai rovinato!\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2OThzu08lMC Isabella de' Medici], by Caroline P. Murphy, page 76. Murphy only mentions the phrase ''Ammannati Ruinati'' as Michelangelo's words. It appears the statue received a cool public welcome relative to the David.</ref> Ammannati continued work on this fountain for a decade, adding around the perimeter a cornucopia of demigod figures: bronze reclining river gods, laughing [[satyr]]s and marble sea horses emerging from the water. \n\nIn 1550 Ammannati married [[Laura Battiferri]], an elegant poet and an accomplished woman.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Later in his life he had a religious crisis, influenced by [[Counter-Reformation]] piety, which resulted in condemning his own works depicting [[nudity]], and he left all his possessions to the [[Jesuits]].\n\nHe died in Florence in 1592.\n\n==Other Sculptures==\n* ''Victory'' (1540), marble, [[Museo Nazionale del Bargello]], Florence.\n* ''[[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] with the Swan'', marble, also in Bargello, Florence.\n* ''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'' (1558\u201359), marble, [[Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]].\n* ''Parnassus'' (1563), marble, Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence.\n* ''Allegory of Winter'' (1563\u201365), stone, [[Villa Medici]], Castello.\n* ''Goddess Opi'' (1572\u201375), bronze, [[Palazzo Vecchio]], Florence.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Pigna - Collegio romano 1080166.JPG|The [[Collegio Romano|Jesuit College]] in Rome, 1582\u201384, was one of Ammannati's later designs\nFile:Venus by Baccio Bandinelli (Prado, E-171) 01.jpg|''Venus'', a variation on the classical type known as [[Aphrodite of Cnidus|Venus Pudica]].

Within these churches, bishops are seen as those who possess the full priesthood and can ordain clergy \u2013 including another bishop. Some [[Protestant]] churches including the [[Lutheran]] and [[Methodist]] churches have bishops serving similar functions as well, though not always understood to be within [[apostolic succession]] in the same way.  One who has been ordained [[deacon]], [[priest]], and then bishop is understood to hold the fullness of the (ministerial) priesthood, given responsibility by Christ to govern, teach and sanctify the [[Body of Christ]], members of the Faithful.

Instead, the Metropolitan bishop (the bishop in a large city) appointed priests to minister each congregation, acting as the bishop's delegate.\n\n=== Apostolic Fathers ===\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2013}}\n\nAround the end of the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]], the church's organization became clearer in historical documents. In the works of the [[Apostolic Fathers]], and [[Ignatius of Antioch]] in particular, the role of the episkopos, or bishop, became more important or, rather, already was very important and being clearly defined. While Ignatius of Antioch offers the earliest clear description of monarchial bishops (a single bishop over all [[house church]]es in a city) he is an advocate of monepiscopal structure rather than describing an accepted reality. To the bishops and house churches to which he writes, he offers strategies on how to pressure house churches who don't recognize the bishop into compliance. Other contemporary Christian writers do not describe monarchial bishops, either continuing to equate them with the presbyters or speaking of episkopoi (bishops, plural) in a city.\n\n[[File:Byzantine - Saint Ignatius of Antioch - Walters 4820867.jpg|thumb|[[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], bishop of Antioch, student of [[John the Apostle]]]]\n\n<blockquote>\"Plainly therefore we ought to regard the bishop as the Lord Himself\" &mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians 6:1.<br />\n\"your godly bishop\" &mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 2:1.<br />\n\"the bishop presiding after the likeness of God and the presbyters after the likeness of the council of the Apostles, with the deacons also who are most dear to me, having been entrusted with the diaconate of Jesus Christ\" &mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 6:1.<br />\n\"Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him], either by Himself or by the Apostles, so neither do ye anything without the bishop and the presbyters.\" &mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 7:1.<br />\n\"Be obedient to the bishop and to one another, as Jesus Christ was to the Father [according to the flesh], and as the Apostles were to Christ and to the Father, that there may be union both of flesh and of spirit.\" &mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 13:2.<br />\n\"In like manner let all men respect the deacons as Jesus Christ, even as they should respect the bishop as being a type of the Father and the presbyters as the council of God and as the college of Apostles.

Churches in the regions outside an important city were served by [[Chorbishop]], an official rank of bishops. However, soon, presbyters and deacons were sent from bishop of a city church. Gradually priests replaced the chorbishops. Thus, in time, the bishop changed from being the leader of a single church confined to an urban area to being the leader of the churches of a given geographical area.\n\n[[Clement of Alexandria]] (end of the 2nd century) writes about the ordination of a certain Zach\u00e6us as bishop by the imposition of [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter Bar-Jonah's]] hands.

As the church moved from the shadows of privacy into the public forum it acquired land for churches, burials and [[clergy]]. In 391, [[Theodosius I]] decreed that any land that had been confiscated from the church by Roman authorities be returned.\n\n[[File:Husaby Church 2013 people on 11th Century gravestone.jpg|thumb|A bishop with other officials on an 11th-century grave in [[Sweden]].]]\n\nThe most usual term for the geographic area of a bishop's authority and ministry, the [[diocese]], began as part of the structure of the [[Roman Empire]] under [[Diocletian]]. As [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Roman authority began to fail in the western portion of the empire]], the church took over much of the civil administration. This can be clearly seen in the ministry of two [[pope]]s: [[Pope Leo I]] in the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]], and [[Pope Gregory I]] in the [[Christianity in the 6th century|6th century]]. Both of these men were statesmen and public administrators in addition to their role as Christian pastors, teachers and leaders. In the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern churches]], [[latifundia]] entailed to a bishop's [[Episcopal see|see]] were much less common, the state power did not collapse the way it did in the West, and thus the tendency of bishops acquiring secular power was much weaker than in the West. However, the role of Western bishops as civil authorities, often called [[Prince-Bishop|prince bishops]], continued throughout much of the [[Middle Ages]].\n\n=== Bishops holding political office ===\n\n[[File:Johann Otto von Gemmingen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johann Otto von Gemmingen]], [[Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg|Prince-Bishop of Augsburg]]]]\n\nAs well as being archchancellors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the 9th century, bishops generally served as [[chancellor]]s to medieval monarchs, acting as head of the ''justiciary'' and chief [[chaplain]]. The [[Lord Chancellor]] of [[England]] was almost always a bishop up until the dismissal of Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Similarly, the position of [[Kanclerz]] in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Polish kingdom]] was always held by a bishop until the [[Christianity in the 16th century|16th century]]. And today, the principality of [[Andorra]] is headed by two co-princes, one of whom is a Catholic bishop (and the other, the President of France).\n\nIn [[France]] before the [[French Revolution]], representatives of the clergy &mdash; in practice, bishops and [[abbot]]s of the largest [[monastery|monasteries]] &mdash; comprised the [[Estates of the realm#First Estate|First Estate]] of the [[French States-General|Estates-General]], until their role was abolished during the [[French Revolution]].\n\nIn the 21st century, the more senior bishops of the [[Church of England]] continue to sit in the [[House of Lords]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], as representatives of the [[established church]], and are known as [[Lords Spiritual]]. The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]], whose [[diocese]] lies outside the [[United Kingdom]], is an [[ex officio member|''ex officio'' member]] of the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man]]. In the past, the [[Bishop of Durham]], known as a prince bishop, had extensive viceregal powers within his northern diocese &mdash; the power to mint money, collect taxes and raise an army to defend against the [[Scottish people|Scots]].\n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] bishops, along with all other members of the clergy, are [[canon law|canonically]] forbidden to hold political office. Occasional exceptions to this rule are tolerated when the alternative is political chaos. In the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], for example, had de facto administrative, fiscal, cultural and legal jurisdiction, as well as spiritual, over all the Christians of the empire. More recently, Archbishop [[Makarios III]] of [[Cyprus]], served as President of the Republic of Cyprus from 1960 to 1977.\n\nIn 2001, [[Peter Hollingworth]], [[List of Companions of the Order of Australia|AC]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] \u2013 then the Anglican Archbishop of [[Anglican Diocese of Brisbane|Brisbane]] \u2013 was controversially appointed [[Governor-General of Australia]]. Although Hollingworth gave up his episcopal position to accept the appointment, it still attracted considerable opposition in a country which maintains a formal [[Separation of church and state|separation between Church and State]].\n\n=== Episcopacy during the English Civil War ===\n{{main|English Civil War#Episcopacy during the English Civil War}}\n\nDuring the period of the [[English Civil War]], the role of bishops as wielders of political power and as upholders of the [[established church]] became a matter of heated political controversy. Indeed, [[Presbyterianism]] was the polity of most [[Reformed Churches]] in Europe, and had been favored by many in England since the English Reformation.  Since in the [[Apostolic Age|primitive church]] the offices of ''presbyter'' and ''episkopos'' were identical, many [[Puritans]] held that this was the only form of government the church should have. The Anglican divine, [[Richard Hooker]], objected to this claim in his famous work ''[[Of the Laws of Ecclesiastic Polity]]'' while, at the same time, defending Presbyterian ordination as valid (in particular [[John Calvin|Calvin's]] ordination of [[Theodore Beza|Beza]]). This was the official stance of the English Church until the Commonwealth, during which time, the views of Presbyterians and Independents ([[Congregationalists]]) were more freely expressed and practiced.\n\n== Churches ==\n\n=== Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Anglican churches ===\n\n{{further|Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop (Eastern Orthodox Church)}}\n\n[[File:Mitre (plain).svg|thumb|right|upright=0.45|A [[mitre]] is used as a symbol of the bishop's ministry in Western Christianity.]]\n[[File:External Ornaments of a Bishop.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.45|One form for the [[coat of arms]] of a Catholic bishop]]\n\nBishops form the leadership in the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the Anglican Communion, the [[Lutheran]] Church, the [[Independent Catholic Churches]], the [[Continuing Anglican movement|Independent Anglican Churches]], and certain other, smaller, denominations.\n\nThe traditional role of a bishop is as pastor of a [[diocese]] (also called a bishopric, [[synod]], [[eparchy]] or [[episcopal see|see]]), and so to serve as a \"diocesan bishop,\" or \"eparch\" as it is called in many Eastern Christian churches. Dioceses vary considerably in size, geographically and population-wise. Some dioceses around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] which were Christianised early are rather compact, whereas dioceses in areas of rapid modern growth in Christian commitment\u2014as in some parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[South America]] and the [[Far East]]\u2014are much larger and more populous.\n\nAs well as traditional diocesan bishops, many churches have a well-developed structure of church leadership that involves a number of layers of authority and responsibility.\n\n; [[Patriarch]]:Patriarchs are the bishops who head certain ancient [[autocephalous]] or [[sui iuris]] churches, which are a collection of metropolitan [[Episcopal see|sees]] or [[province]]s. After the First Ecumenical Council at Nicea, the church structure was patterned after the administrative divisions of the Roman Empire wherein a metropolitan or bishop of a metropolis came to be the ecclesiastical head of a civil capital of a province or a metropolis. Whereas, the bishop of the larger administrative district, diocese, came to be called an exarch. In a few cases, a bishop came to preside over a number of dioceses, i.e., Rome, Antioch, and Alexandria. At the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451, Constantinople was given jurisdiction over three dioceses for the reason that the city was \"the residence of the emperor and senate\". Additionally, Jerusalem was recognized at the Council of Chalcedon as one of the major sees. In 692, the Quinisext Council formally recognized and ranked the sees of the Pentarchy in order of preeminence, at that time Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. In the Catholic Church, Patriarchs sometimes call their leaders ''Catholicos''; the Patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Egypt, is called ''Pope'', meaning 'Father'. While most patriarchs in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] have jurisdiction over a \"ritual church\" (a group or diocese of a particular Eastern tradition), all [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]] patriarchs, except for the [[Pope]], have only honorary titles. In 2006, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] gave up the title of [[Patriarch of the West]]. The first recorded use of the title by a Roman Pope was by [[Pope Theodore I|Theodore I]] in 620. However, early church documents, such as those of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) had always listed the Pope of Rome first among the [[Pentarchy (Christianity)|Ancient Patriarchs]] (first four, and later five: [[Pope|Rome]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]] and [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]\u2014collectively referred to as the ''Pentarchy''). Later, the heads of various national churches became Patriarchs, but they are ranked below the Pentarchy.\n; [[Catholicos]]: [[File:Mitra5.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Mitre]] worn by an Eastern bishop with [[icon]]s of Christ, the [[Theotokos]] (Mary, Mother of God) and [[John the Baptist|Forerunner]] (John the Baptist)]] Catholicoi are the heads of some of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], and Eastern Rite Catholic [[sui iuris]] churches (notably the Armenian), roughly similar to a Patriarch (see above).\n; [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]]:A primate is usually the bishop of the oldest church of a [[nation]]. Sometimes this carries jurisdiction over metropolitan bishops, but usually it is purely honorific. The primate of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] is chosen from among the diocesan bishops, and, while retaining diocesan responsibility, is called ''Primus''.\n; [[Presiding bishop]] or president bishop: These titles are often used for the head of a national Anglican church, but the title is not usually associated with a particular [[episcopal see]] like the title of a primate.\n; [[Major archbishop]]:Major archbishops are the heads of some of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Their authority within their ''sui juris'' church is equal to that of a patriarch, but they receive fewer ceremonial honors.\n; [[Metropolitan bishop]]: A metropolitan bishop is an archbishop in charge of an [[ecclesiastical province]], or group of dioceses, and in addition to having immediate jurisdiction over his own archdiocese, also exercises some oversight over the other dioceses within that province. Sometimes a metropolitan may also be the head of an [[autocephalous]], ''[[sui iuris]]'', or [[autonomous area|autonomous]] church when the number of adherents of that tradition are small. In the Latin Rite, metropolitans are always archbishops; in many Eastern churches, the title is \"metropolitan,\" with some of these churches using \"archbishop\" as a separate office.\n; [[Archbishop]]:[[File:Archbishop William Temple.jpg|thumb|[[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[William Temple (archbishop)|William Temple]]]] An archbishop is the bishop of an [[archdiocese]]. This is usually a prestigious diocese with an important place in local church history. In the Catholic Church, the title is purely honorific and carries no extra jurisdiction, though most archbishops are also metropolitan bishops, as above, and are always awarded a [[pallium]]. In most provinces of the Anglican Communion, however, an archbishop has metropolitical and primatial power.\n; [[Suffragan bishop]]: A suffragan bishop is a bishop subordinate to a Metropolitan. In the [[Catholic Church]] this term is applied to all non-metropolitan bishops (that is, diocesan bishops of dioceses within a metropolitan's province, and [[auxiliary bishop]]s). In the Anglican Communion, the term applies to a bishop who is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop: the [[Bishop of Warwick]] is suffragan to the [[Bishop of Coventry]] (the diocesan), though both live in [[Coventry]].\n; Area bishop: Some Anglican suffragans are given the responsibility for a geographical area within the diocese (for example, the [[Bishop of Stepney]] is an ''area bishop'' within the [[Diocese of London]]).\n; [[Titular bishop]]: A titular bishop is a bishop without a diocese. Rather, the bishop is head of a [[titular see]], which is usually an ancient city that used to have a bishop, but, for some reason or other, does not have one now. Titular bishops often serve as [[auxiliary bishop]]s. In the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]], bishops of modern dioceses are often given a titular see alongside their modern one (for example, the Archbishop of [[Thyateira]] ''and'' [[Great Britain]]).\n; [[Auxiliary bishop]]: An auxiliary bishop is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop (the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox equivalent of an Anglican suffragan bishop). An auxiliary bishop is a [[titular bishop]], and he is to be appointed as a [[vicar general]] or at least as an [[episcopal vicar]] of the diocese in which he serves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1F.HTM | title=Canon 406 | work=Code of Canon Law | year=1983 | accessdate=2009-06-15 | publisher=The [[Holy See]] }}</ref>\n; [[Coadjutor bishop]]: A coadjutor bishop is an auxiliary bishop who is given almost equal authority in a diocese with the diocesan bishop, and the automatic right to succeed the incumbent diocesan bishop. The appointment of coadjutors is often seen as a means of providing for continuity of church leadership.\n; [[Assistant bishop]]: Honorary assistant bishop, assisting bishop, or bishop emeritus: these titles are usually applied to retired bishops who are given a general licence to minister as episcopal pastors under a diocesan's oversight. The titles, in this meaning, are not used by the Catholic Church.\n; General bishop: a title and role in some churches, not associated with a diocese. In the Coptic Orthodox Church the episcopal ranks from highest to lowest are metropolitan archbishops, metropolitan bishops, diocesan bishops, bishops exarchs of the throne, suffragan bishops, auxiliary bishops, general bishops, and finally chorbishops. Bishops of the same category rank according to date of consecration.\n; [[Chorbishop]]: A chorbishop is an official of a diocese in some Eastern Christian churches. Chorbishops are not generally ordained bishops \u2013 they are not given the sacrament of Holy Orders in that degree \u2013 but function as assistants to the diocesan bishop with certain honorary privileges.\n; [[Supreme bishop]]: The [[obispo maximo]], or supreme bishop, of the [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]] is elected by the General Assembly of the Church. He is the chief executive officer of the Church. He also holds an important pastoral role, being the spiritual head and chief pastor of the Church. He has precedence of honor and prominence of position among, and recognized to have primacy, over other bishops.\n; [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]:In Catholicism, a cardinal, a title dating back to the 8th century, is a member of the clergy appointed by the pope to serve in the [[College of Cardinals]]. This body is empowered to elect a new pope in [[sede vacante]], but cardinals over the age of 80 may not be electors. Cardinals serve as advisors to the pope and hold positions of authority within the structure of the Catholic Church. Under modern canon law, a man who is not a bishop who is appointed a cardinal must accept ordination as a bishop, or seek special permission from the pope to decline ordination. Most cardinals are already bishops at the time of their appointment, the majority being archbishops of important archdioceses or patriarchs, and a substantial portion of the rest already titular archbishops serving in the Vatican. Recent popes have appointed a few priests, most of them influential theologians, to the College of Cardinals without requiring them to be ordained as bishops; invariably, these men are near or over the age of 80, and consequently not eligible to take part in a conclave.\n\n==== Duties ====\n\n[[File:Confirmation VanderWeyden.png|thumb|upright|A bishop administering Confirmation. [[Rogier van der Weyden]], ''[[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece|The Seven Sacraments]]'', 15th century.<br />In the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] the administration of [[Confirmation]] is normally reserved to the local bishop.]]\n\nIn [[Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and [[Anglicanism]], only a bishop can ordain other bishops, [[priest]]s, and [[deacon]]s.\n\nIn the Eastern liturgical tradition, a priest can celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] only with the blessing of a bishop. In Byzantine usage, an [[antimins|antimension]] signed by the bishop is kept on the altar partly as a reminder of whose altar it is and under whose [[omophorion]] the priest at a local parish is serving. In Syriac Church usage, a consecrated wooden block called a [[thabilitho]] is kept for the same reasons.\n\nThe [[pope]], in addition to being the [[Bishop of Rome]] and spiritual head of the [[Catholic Church]], is also the Patriarch of the [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]]. Each bishop within the Latin Rite is answerable directly to the Pope and not any other bishop except to metropolitans in certain oversight instances. The pope previously used the title ''Patriarch of the West'', but this title was dropped from use in 2006<ref>{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060308013147/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0601225.htm |title=Catholic News Service 2 March 2006 |date=2006-03-08}}</ref> a move which caused some concern within the Eastern Orthodox Communion as, to them, it implied wider papal jurisdiction.<ref>{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060613190031/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0603382.htm |title=CNS 13 June 2006 |date=2006-06-13}}</ref>\n\nIn Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Anglican [[cathedral]]s there is a special chair set aside for the exclusive use of the bishop. This is the bishop's ''[[cathedra]]'' and is often called the [[throne]]. In some Christian denominations, for example, the Anglican Communion, parish churches may maintain a chair for the use of the bishop when he visits; this is to signify the parish's union with the bishop.\n\nThe bishop is the ordinary minister of the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] of [[confirmation]] in the Latin Rite [[Catholic Church]], and in the Anglican and [[Old Catholic]] communion only a bishop may administer this sacrament. However, in the [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] and other Eastern rites, whether Eastern or Oriental Orthodox or [[Eastern Catholic]], [[chrismation]] is done immediately after [[baptism]], and thus the priest is the one who confirms, using chrism blessed by a bishop.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3U.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1313] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014929/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3U.HTM |date=27 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==== Ordination of Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Anglican bishops ====\n{{Refimprove section\n| date = June 2016\n}}\n\nBishops in all of these communions are [[Holy Orders|ordained]] by other bishops through the [[laying on of hands]]. While traditional teaching maintains that any bishop with [[apostolic succession]] can validly perform the ordination of another bishop, some churches require two or three bishops participate, either to ensure sacramental validity or to conform with church law. [[Catholic]] doctrine holds that one bishop can validly ordain another (priest) as a bishop. Though a minimum of three bishops participating is desirable (there are usually several more) in order to demonstrate collegiality, canonically only one bishop is necessary. The practice of only one bishop ordaining was normal in countries where the Church was persecuted under [[Communist]] rule.\nThe title of archbishop or metropolitan may be granted to a senior bishop, usually one who is in charge of a large ecclesiastical jurisdiction. He may, or may not, have provincial oversight of suffragan bishops and may possibly have auxiliary bishops assisting him.\nOrdination of a bishop, and thus continuation of apostolic succession, takes place through a ritual centred on the [[imposition of hands]] and [[prayer]].\nApart from the ordination, which is always done by other bishops, there are different methods as to the actual selection of a candidate for ordination as bishop. In the [[Catholic Church]] the [[Congregation for Bishops]] generally oversees the selection of new bishops with the approval of the [[pope]]. The papal nuncio usually solicits names from the bishops of a country, consults with priests and leading members of a laity, and then selects three to be forwarded to the [[Holy See]]. In Europe, some cathedral chapters have duties to elect bishops.  The Eastern Catholic churches generally elect their own bishops. Most Eastern Orthodox churches allow varying amounts of formalised laity or [[lower clergy]] influence on the choice of bishops. This also applies in those Eastern churches which are in union with the pope, though it is required that he give assent.\n\nCatholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, Old Catholic and some Lutheran bishops claim to be part of the continuous sequence of ordained bishops since the days of the apostles referred to as [[apostolic succession]]. Since [[Pope Leo XIII]] issued the bull ''[[Apostolicae curae]]'' in 1896, the Catholic Church has insisted that Anglican orders are invalid because of changes in the Anglican ordination rites of the 16th century and divergence in understanding of the theology of priesthood, episcopacy and Eucharist. However, since the 1930s, Utrecht Old Catholic bishops (recognised by the Holy See as validily ordained) have sometimes taken part in the ordination of Anglican bishops. According to the writer Timothy Dufort, by 1969, all Church of England bishops had acquired Old Catholic lines of [[apostolic succession]] recognised by the Holy See.<ref>Timothy Dufort, ''The Tablet'', 29 May 1982, pp. 536\u2013538.</ref> This development has muddied the waters somewhat as it could be argued that the strain of apostolic succession has been re-introduced into Anglicanism, at least within the Church of England.\n\nThe Catholic Church does recognise as valid (though illicit) ordinations done by breakaway Catholic, Old Catholic or Oriental bishops, and groups descended from them; it also regards as both valid and licit those ordinations done by bishops of the Eastern churches,{{efn|Section 16 of the Second Vatican Council's Decree on Ecumenism, [[Unitatis Redintegratio]] states: \"To remove, then, all shadow of doubt, this holy Council solemnly declares that the Churches of the East, while remembering the necessary unity of the whole Church, have the power to govern themselves according to the disciplines proper to them, since these are better suited to the character of their faithful, and more for the good of their souls.\"}} so long as those receiving the ordination conform to other canonical requirements (for example, is an adult male) and an eastern orthodox rite of episcopal ordination, expressing the proper functions and sacramental status of a bishop, is used; this has given rise to the phenomenon of ''[[episcopi vagantes]]'' (for example, clergy of the Independent Catholic groups which claim apostolic succession, though this claim is rejected by both Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy).\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Churches would not accept the validity of any ordinations performed by the Independent Catholic groups, as Eastern Orthodoxy considers to be spurious any consecration outside the Church as a whole. Eastern Orthodoxy considers [[apostolic succession]] to exist only within the Universal Church, and not through any authority held by individual bishops; thus, if a bishop ordains someone to serve outside the (Eastern Orthodox) Church, the ceremony is ineffectual, and no ordination has taken place regardless of the ritual used or the ordaining prelate's position within the Eastern Orthodox Churches.\n\n[[File:Priestly ordination.jpg|thumb|left|The consecrated bishop is the only minister of [[Holy Orders]]. Photo of pre-Vatican II ceremony]]\n\nThe position of the Catholic Church is slightly different. Whilst it does recognise the validity of the orders of certain groups which separated from communion with Holy See. The Holy See accepts as valid the ordinations of the [[Old Catholic]]s in communion with Utrecht, as well as the [[Polish National Catholic Church]] (which received its orders directly from Utrecht, and was\u2014until recently\u2014part of that communion); but Catholicism does not recognise the orders of any group whose teaching is at variance with what they consider the core tenets of Christianity; this is the case even though the clergy of the Independent Catholic groups may use the proper ordination ritual. There are also other reasons why the Holy See does not recognise the validity of the orders of the Independent clergy:\n\n* They hold that the continuing practice among many Independent clergy of one person receiving multiple ordinations in order to secure apostolic succession, betrays an incorrect and mechanistic theology of ordination.\n* They hold that the practice within Independent groups of ordaining women demonstrates an understanding of Priesthood that they vindicate is totally unacceptable to the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches as they believe that the Universal Church does not possess such authority; thus, they uphold that any ceremonies performed by these women should be considered being sacramentally invalid.\n* The theology of male clergy within the Independent movement is also suspect according to the Catholics, as they presumably approve of the ordination of females, and may have even undergone an (invalid) ordination ceremony conducted by a woman.\n\n[[File:JeffertsSchori.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Katharine Jefferts Schori]], The 26th presiding bishop of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]]]]\n\nWhilst members of the [[Independent Catholic]] movement take seriously the issue of valid orders, it is highly significant that the relevant Vatican Congregations tend not to respond to petitions from Independent Catholic bishops and clergy who seek to be received into communion with the Holy See, hoping to continue in some sacramental role. In those instances where the pope does grant reconciliation, those deemed to be clerics within the Independent Old Catholic movement are invariably admitted as laity and not priests or bishops.\n\nThere is a mutual recognition of the validity of orders amongst Catholic, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Old Catholic]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]] churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roberson|first=Ronald|date=Spring 2010|title=The Dialogues of the Catholic Church with the Separated Eastern Churches|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40731267?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=28|pages=135-152|via=}}</ref>\n\nSome [[Ecclesiastical province|provinces]] of the Anglican Communion have begun [[ordination of women|ordaining women]] as bishops in recent decades for example, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Cuba. The first woman to be consecrated a bishop within Anglicanism was [[Barbara Harris (bishop)|Barbara Harris]], who was ordained in the United States in 1989.

Since the implementation of concordats between the ELCA and the [[Episcopal Church of the United States]] and the ELCIC and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], all bishops, including the presiding bishop (ELCA) or the national bishop (ELCIC), have been consecrated using the historic succession, with at least one Anglican bishop serving as co-consecrator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/ecumenical/fullcommunion/episcopal/ccmresources/text.html|title=A Lutheran Proposal for a Revision of the Concordat of Agreement |archivedate=2011-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514195302/http://www2.elca.org/ecumenical/fullcommunion/Episcopal/CCMresources/text.html|date=19 August 1999 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/lutheranpartners/archives/histepi.html|last= Wright, |first=J.

Unlike their counterparts in the [[United Methodist Church]], ELCA and ELCIC synod bishops do not appoint pastors to local congregations (pastors, like their counterparts in the Episcopal Church, are called by local congregations). The presiding bishop of the ELCA and the national bishop of the ELCIC, the national bishops of their respective bodies, are elected for a single 6-year term and may be elected to an additional term.\n\nAlthough ELCA agreed with the Episcopal Church to limit ordination to the bishop \"ordinarily\", ELCA pastor-''ordinators'' are given permission to perform the rites in \"extraordinary\" circumstance. In practice, \"extraordinary\" circumstance have included disagreeing with Episcopalian views of the episcopate, and as a result, ELCA pastors ordained by other pastors are not permitted to be deployed to Episcopal Churches (they can, however, serve in [[Presbyterian Church USA]], [[United Methodist Church]], [[Reformed Church in America]], and [[Moravian Church]] congregations, as the ELCA is in full communion with these denominations). The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS), the second and third largest Lutheran bodies in the United States and the two largest [[Confessional Lutheran]] bodies in North America, do not follow an episcopal form of governance, settling instead on a form of quasi-congregationalism patterned off what they believe to be the practice of the early church. It should be noted that the second largest of the three predecessor bodies of the ELCA, the [[American Lutheran Church]], was a congregationalist body, with national and synod presidents before they were re-titled as bishops (borrowing from the Lutheran churches in Germany) in the 1980s. It must also be noted that with regard to ecclesial discipline and oversight, national and synod presidents typically function similarly to bishops in episcopal bodies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kencollins.com/explanations/why-12.htm|title=The Function of Bishops in the Ancient Church|work=kencollins.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Methodism ===\n{{main|Bishop (Methodism)}}\n\n====African Methodist Episcopal Church====\nIn the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], \"Bishops are the Chief Officers of the Connectional Organization. They are elected for life by a majority vote of the General Conference which meets every four years.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ame-church.com/leadership/bishops-of-the-church/|title=Bishops of the Church|year=2014|publisher=African Methodist Episcopal Church|language=English|accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Christian Methodist Episcopal Church ====\n\nIn the [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church]] in the United States, bishops are administrative superintendents of the church; they are elected by \"delegate\" votes for as many years deemed until the age of 74, then he/she must retire. Among their duties, are responsibility for appointing clergy to serve local churches as pastor, for performing ordinations, and for safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the Church. The General Conference, a meeting every four years, has an equal number of clergy and lay delegates. In each Annual Conference, CME bishops serve for four-year terms. CME Church bishops may be male or female.\n\n==== United Methodist Church ====\n[[File:UMEpiscopalShield.jpg|thumb|right|United Methodist Episcopal Shield]]\n\nIn the [[United Methodist Church]] (the largest branch of Methodism in the world) bishops serve as administrative and pastoral superintendents of the church. They are elected for life from among the [[Elder (Methodism)|ordained elders]] (presbyters) by vote of the delegates in regional (called jurisdictional) conferences, and are consecrated by the other bishops present at the conference through the laying on of hands. In the United Methodist Church bishops remain members of the \"[[Elder (Methodism)|Order of Elders]]\" while being consecrated to the \"[[Episcopal polity|Office of the Episcopacy]]\". Within the United Methodist Church only bishops are empowered to consecrate bishops and ordain clergy. Among their most critical duties is the ordination and appointment of clergy to serve local churches as pastor, presiding at sessions of the Annual, Jurisdictional, and General Conferences, providing pastoral ministry for the clergy under their charge, and safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the Church. Furthermore, individual bishops, or the Council of Bishops as a whole, often serve a prophetic role, making statements on important social issues and setting forth a vision for the denomination, though they have no legislative authority of their own. In all of these areas, bishops of the United Methodist Church function very much in the historic meaning of the term. According to the ''[[Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]]'', a bishop's responsibilities are {{quote|\n''Leadership.\u2014Spiritual and Temporal''\u2014\n\n# To lead and oversee the spiritual and temporal affairs of The United Methodist Church, which confesses Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and particularly to lead the Church in its mission of witness and service in the world.\n# To travel through the connection at large as the Council of Bishops (\u00b6 526) to implement strategy for the concern of the Church.\n# To provide liaison and leadership in the quest for Christian unity in ministry, mission, and structure and in the search for strengthened relationships with other living faith communities.\n# To organize such Missions as shall have been authorized by the [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]].\n# To promote and support the evangelistic vision of the whole Church.\n# To discharge such other duties as the Discipline may direct.\n\n''Presidential Duties.''\u20141. To preside in the General, Jurisdictional, Central, and Annual Conferences. 2. To form the districts after consultation with the district superintendents and after the number of the same has been determined by vote of the Annual Conference. 3. To appoint the [[District Superintendent (United Methodist Church)|district superintendents]] annually (\u00b6\u00b6 517\u2013518). 4. To consecrate bishops, to ordain elders and deacons, to consecrate diaconal ministers, to commission [[deaconess]]es and home missionaries, and to see that the names of the persons commissioned and consecrated are entered on the journals of the conference and that proper credentials are funised to these persons.\n\n''Working with Ministers.''\u20141.

To read the appointments of deaconesses, diaconal ministers, lay persons in service under the World Division of the General Board of Global Ministries, and home missionaries. 4. To fix the Charge Conference membership of all ordained ministers appointed to ministries other than the local church in keeping with \u00b6443.3. 5. To transfer, upon the request of the receiving bishop, ministerial member(s) of one Annual Conference to another, ''provided'' said member(s) agrees to transfer; and to send immediately to the secretaries of both conferences involved, to the conference Boards of Ordained Ministry, and to the clearing house of the General Board of Pensions written notices of the transfer of members and of their standing in the course of study if they are undergraduates.{{sfn|Anon|1980|p=}} }}\n\nIn each Annual Conference, United Methodist bishops serve for four-year terms, and may serve up to three terms before either retirement or appointment to a new Conference. United Methodist bishops may be male or female, with [[Marjorie Matthews]] being the first woman to be consecrated a bishop in 1980.\n\n[[File:The Ordination of Bishop Asbury.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Francis Asbury]]'s ordination as bishop by [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] at the 1784 [[Christmas Conference]].]]\n\nThe collegial expression of episcopal leadership in the [[United Methodist Church]] is known as the [[United Methodist Council of Bishops|Council of Bishops]]. The Council of Bishops speaks to the Church and through the Church into the world and gives leadership in the quest for Christian unity and interreligious relationships.{{sfn|Anon|1980|p=}} The Conference of Methodist Bishops includes the United Methodist ''Council of Bishops'' plus bishops from affiliated autonomous [[Methodist]] or [[United and uniting churches|United]] Churches.\n\n[[John Wesley]] consecrated [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] a \"General Superintendent,\" and directed that [[Francis Asbury]] also be consecrated for the United States of America in 1784, where the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] first became a separate [[religious denomination|denomination]] apart from the Church of England. Coke soon returned to England, but Asbury was the primary builder of the new church. At first he did not call himself bishop, but eventually submitted to the usage by the denomination.\n\nNotable bishops in United Methodist history include [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Coke]], [[Francis Asbury|Asbury]], [[Richard Whatcoat]], [[Philip William Otterbein]], [[Martin Boehm]], [[Jacob Albright]], [[John Seybert]], [[Matthew Simpson]], [[John S. Stamm]], [[William Ragsdale Cannon]], [[Marjorie Matthews]], [[Leontine T. Kelly]], [[William B. Oden]], [[Ntambo Nkulu Ntanda]], [[Joseph Sprague]], [[William Henry Willimon]], and [[Thomas Bickerton]].\n\n=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===\n{{Main|Bishop (Latter Day Saints)}}\n\nIn [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|Bishop]] is the leader of a local congregation, called a [[ward (LDS Church)|ward]]. As with most LDS priesthood holders, the bishop is a part-time lay minister and earns a living through other employment; in all cases, he is a married man. As such, it is his duty to preside at services, call local leaders, and judge the worthiness of members for service. The bishop does not deliver sermons at every service (generally asking members to do so), but is expected to be a spiritual guide for his congregation. It is therefore believed that he has both the right and ability to receive divine inspiration (through the [[Holy Spirit]]) for the [[ward (LDS Church)|ward]] under his direction. Because it is a part-time position, all able members are expected to assist in the management of the ward by holding delegated lay positions (for example, women's and youth leaders, teachers) referred to as 'callings.' Although members are asked to confess serious sins to him, unlike the [[Catholic Church]], he is not the instrument of divine forgiveness, merely a guide through the repentance process (and a judge in case transgressions warrant excommunication or other official discipline). The bishop is also responsible for the physical welfare of the ward, and thus collects [[Tithe|tithing]] and [[fast offering]]s and distributes financial assistance where needed.\n\nA bishop is the president of the [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] in his ward (and is thus a form of Mormon [[Kohen]]; in fact, a literal descendant of Aaron has \"legal right\" to act as a bishop<ref>[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.76?lang=eng#75 Doctrine and Covenants 107:76]</ref> after being found worthy and ordained by the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]<ref name=\"Doctrine and Covenants 68:20\">[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.20?lang=eng#19 Doctrine and Covenants 68:20]</ref>). In the absence of a literal descendant of Aaron, a [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|High priest]] in the [[Melchizedek priesthood]] is called to be a bishop.<ref name=\"Doctrine and Covenants 68:20\"/> Each bishop is selected from resident members of the ward by the [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake presidency]] with approval of the First Presidency, and chooses two ''counselors'' to form a ''bishopric''. In special circumstances (such as a ward consisting entirely of young university students), a bishop may be chosen from outside the ward. A bishop is typically released after about five years and a new bishop is called to the position. Although the former bishop is released from his duties, he continues to hold the Aaronic priesthood office of bishop. Church members frequently refer to a former bishop as \"Bishop\" as a sign of respect and affection.\n\nLatter-day Saint bishops do not wear any special clothing or insignia the way clergy in many other churches do, but are expected to dress and groom themselves neatly and conservatively per their local culture, especially when performing official duties. Bishops (as well as other members of the priesthood) can trace their line of authority back to [[Joseph Smith]], who, according to church doctrine, was ordained to lead the Church in modern times by the ancient [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]], who were ordained to lead the Church by Jesus Christ.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Joseph|title=Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith|year=2007|page=101|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-8?lang=eng}}</ref>\n\nAt the global level, the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|presiding bishop]] oversees the temporal affairs (buildings, properties, commercial corporations, and so on) of the worldwide Church, including the Church's massive global humanitarian aid and social welfare programs. The presiding bishop has two counselors; the three together form the presiding bishopric.<ref>{{cite web|last=McMullin|first=Keith B.|title=The Presiding Bishopric|url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/07/the-presiding-bishopric?lang=eng|work=Ensign|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref> As opposed to ward bishoprics, where the counselors do not hold the office of bishop, all three men in the presiding bishopric hold the office of bishop, and thus the counselors, as with the presiding bishop, are formally referred to as \"Bishop\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/presiding-bishopric|title=Learn More About the Church's Presiding Bishopric|work=www.mormonnewsroom.org|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== New Apostolic Church ===\n\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]] (NAC) knows three classes of ministries: Deacons, Priests and Apostles. The [[New Apostolic Church#Ministries|Apostles]], who are all included in the apostolate with the [[Chief Apostle]] as head, are the highest ministries.\n\nOf the several kinds of priest....ministries, the bishop is the highest. Nearly all bishops are set in line directly from the chief apostle. They support and help their superior apostle.\n\n=== Church of God in Christ ===\nIn the [[Church of God in Christ|Church of God in Christ (COGIC)]], the ecclesiastical structure is composed of large dioceses that are called \"jurisdictions\" within COGIC, each under the authority of a bishop, sometimes called \"state bishops\". They can either be made up of large geographical regions of churches or churches that are grouped and organized together as their own separate jurisdictions because of similar affiliations, regardless of geographical location or dispersion. Each state in the U.S. has at least one jurisdiction while others may have several more, and each jurisdiction is usually composed of between 30 and 100 churches. Each jurisdiction is then broken down into several districts, which are smaller groups of churches (either grouped by geographical situation or by similar affiliations) which are each under the authority of District Superintendents who answer to the authority of their jurisdictional/state bishop. There are currently over 170 jurisdictions in the United States, and over 30 jurisdictions in other countries. The bishops of each jurisdiction, according to the COGIC Manual, are considered to be the modern day equivalent in the church of the early apostles and overseers of the New Testament church, and as the highest ranking clergymen in the COGIC, they are tasked with the responsibilities of being the head overseers of all religious, civil, and economic ministries and protocol for the church denomination.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=COGIC Manual|last=|first=|publisher=Church of God in Christ Publishing House|year=1973|isbn=978-1940378428|location=Memphis, Tennessee|pages=133\u2013141}}</ref> They also have the authority to appoint and [[Ordination|ordain]] local [[pastor]]s, [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]], [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]], and [[The Reverend|reverends]] within the denomination. The bishops of the COGIC denomination are all collectively called \"The Board of Bishops.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cogic.org/about-company/the-judicial-branch/board-of-bishops/|title=Board of Bishops|work=Church Of God In Christ|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en-US}}</ref> From the Board of Bishops, and the General Assembly of the COGIC, the body of the church composed of clergy and lay delegates that are responsible for making and enforcing the bylaws of the denomination, every four years, twelve bishops from the COGIC are elected as \"The General Board\" of the church, who work alongside the delegates of the General Assembly and Board of Bishops to provide administration over the denomination as the church's head executive leaders.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cogic.org/about-company/the-executive-branch/general-board/|title=The General Board|work=Church Of God In Christ|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en-US}}</ref> One of twelve bishops of the General Board is also elected the \"[[Presiding bishop|presiding bishop]]\" of the church, and two others are appointed by the presiding bishop himself, as his first and second assistant presiding bishops.\n\nBishops in the Church of God in Christ usually wear black clergy suits which consist of a black suit blazer, black pants, a purple or scarlet clergy shirt and a white clerical collar, which is usually referred to as \"Class B Civic attire.\" Bishops in COGIC also typically wear the Anglican Choir Dress style vestments of a long purple or scarlet chimere, cuffs, and tippet worn over a long white rochet, and a gold pectoral cross worn around the neck with the tippet. This is usually referred to as \"Class A Ceremonial attire\". The bishops of COGIC alternate between Class A Ceremonial attire and Class B Civic attire depending on the protocol of the religious services and other events they have to attend.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) ===\n\nIn the polity of the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)]], the international leader is the presiding bishop, and the members of the executive committee are executive bishops. Collectively, they supervise and appoint national and state leaders across the world. Leaders of individual states and regions are administrative bishops, who have jurisdiction over local churches in their respective states and are vested with appointment authority for local pastorates. All ministers are credentialed at one of three levels of licensure, the most senior of which is the rank of ordained bishop. To be eligible to serve in state, national, or international positions of authority, a minister must hold the rank of ordained bishop.\n\n=== Pentecostal Church of God ===\n\nIn 2002, the general convention of the [[Pentecostal Church of God]] came to a consensus to change the title of their overseer from general superintendent to bishop. The change was brought on because internationally, the term ''bishop'' is more commonly related to religious leaders than the previous title.\n\nThe title ''bishop'' is used for both the general (international leader) and the district (state) leaders. The title is sometimes used in conjunction with the previous, thus becoming general (district) superintendent/bishop.\n\n=== Seventh-day Adventists ===\n\nAccording to the Seventh-day Adventist understanding of the doctrine of the Church:\n\n\"The \"elders\" (Greek, presbuteros) or \"bishops\" (episkopos) were the most important officers of the church. The term elder means older one, implying dignity and respect. His position was similar to that of the one who had supervision of the synagogue. The term bishop means \"overseer.\" Paul used these terms interchangeably, equating elders with overseers or bishops (Acts 20:17,[[Acts 20:28|28]]; Titus 1:5, 7).\n\n\"Those who held this position supervised the newly formed churches. Elder referred to the status or rank of the office, while bishop denoted the duty or responsibility of the office\u2014\"overseer.\" Since the apostles also called themselves elders (1 Peter 5:1; 2 John 1; 3 John 1), it is apparent that there were both local elders and itinerant elders, or elders at large. But both kinds of elder functioned as shepherds of the congregations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ministerial Association, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|title=Seventh-day Adventists Believe|date=1988|publisher=Review and Herald Publishing Association|location=Hagarstown, Maryland|pages=146, 147}}</ref>\"\n\nThe above understanding is part of the basis of Adventist organizational structure. The world wide Seventh-day Adventist church is organized into local districts, conferences or missions, union conferences or union missions, divisions, and finally at the top is the general conference.  At each level (with exception to the local districts), there is an elder who is elected president and a group of elders who serve on the executive committee with the elected president.  Those who have been elected president would in effect be the \"bishop\" while never actually carrying the title or ordained as such because the term is usually associated with the episcopal style of church governance most often found in Catholic, Anglican, Methodist and some Pentecostal/Charismatic circles.\n\n=== Others ===\nSome Baptists also have begun taking on the title of ''bishop''.<ref name=\"bost_More\">{{Cite news\n| title = More Baptist pastors adopt bishop title\n| author = Lisa Wangsness\n| newspaper= The Boston Globe\n| date = 19 July 2010\n| accessdate = 2014-09-07\n| url = http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/07/19/more_baptist_pastors_adopt_bishop_title/?page=1\n| quote =\n}}</ref>\nIn some smaller Protestant denominations and independent churches, the term ''bishop'' is used in the same way as ''pastor'', to refer to the leader of the local congregation, and may be male or female. This usage is especially common in African-American churches in the US.\n\nIn the [[Church of Scotland]], which has a Presbyterian church structure, the word \"bishop\" refers to an ordained person, usually a normal parish minister, who has temporary oversight of a trainee minister. In the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], the term bishop is an expressive name for a Minister of Word and Sacrament who serves a congregation and exercises \"the oversight of the flock of Christ.\"<ref name=\"presby\">{{cite book|publisher=Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)

Larger geographical areas, called Territories, are led by a Territorial Commander, who is the highest-ranking officer in that Territory.\n\nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses do not use the title \u2018Bishop\u2019 within their organizational structure, but appoint elders to be overseers (to fulfill the role of oversight) within their congregations.<ref>Refs: [[Acts 20:28]], {{bibleref|Phil|1:1}}, {{bibleref|1Tim|3:1\u20137}}, {{bibleref|Titus|1:7}}, {{bibleref|1Peter|5:1\u20132}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/congregations-organized/ |title= JW.org/FAQ: How Are Congregations of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Organised? |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[HKBP]] of [[Indonesia]], the most prominent [[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]] [[Protestantism in Indonesia|in Indonesia]], uses the term [[Ephorus]] instead of Bishop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://iksynod.org/hkbp/ |title= Global Missions in the Indiana-Kentucky Synod: Indonesia: the Huria Kristen Batak Protestan Church on the island of Sumatra|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the Vietnamese syncretist religion of [[Caodaism]], bishops (''giao su'') comprise the fifth of nine hierarchical levels, and are responsible for spiritual and temporal education as well as record-keeping and ceremonies in their parishes. At any one time there are seventy-two bishops. Their authority is described in Section I of the text ''Tan Luat'' (revealed through seances in December 1926). Caodai bishops wear robes and headgear of embroidered silk depicting the Divine Eye and the Eight Trigrams. (The color varies according to branch.) This is the full ceremonial dress; the simple version consists of a seven-layered turban.\n\n== Dress and insignia ==\n{{Main|Pontifical vestments}}\n\nTraditionally, a number of items are associated with the office of a bishop, most notably the [[mitre]], [[crosier]], and [[ecclesiastical ring]]. Other vestments and insignia vary between Eastern and Western Christianity.\n\nIn the Latin Rite of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[choir dress]] of a bishop includes the purple [[cassock]] with amaranth trim, [[rochet]], purple [[zucchetto]] (skull cap), purple [[biretta]], and [[pectoral cross]]. The [[cappa magna]] may be worn, but only within the bishop's own diocese and on especially solemn occasions.{{sfn|Stehle|1914|p=}} The [[mitre]], [[zuchetto]], and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] are generally worn by bishops when presiding over liturgical functions. For liturgical functions other than the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] the bishop typically wears the [[cope]]. Within his own [[diocese]] and when celebrating solemnly elsewhere with the consent of the local [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]], he also uses the [[crosier]].{{sfn|Stehle|1914|p=}} When celebrating [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], a bishop, like a [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]], wears the [[chasuble]]. The [[Caeremoniale Episcoporum]] recommends, but does not impose, that in solemn celebrations a bishop should also wear a [[dalmatic]], which can always be white, beneath the chasuble, especially when administering the sacrament of [[holy orders]], blessing an abbot or abbess, and dedicating a church or an altar.{{sfn|Stehle|1914|p=}} The Caeremoniale Episcoporum no longer makes mention of [[episcopal gloves]], [[episcopal sandals]], [[liturgical stockings]] (also known as [[buskins]]), or the accoutrements that it once prescribed for the bishop's horse. The coat of arms of a Latin Rite Catholic bishop usually displays a [[galero]] with a cross and crosier behind the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]; the specifics differ by location and ecclesiastical rank (see [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]]).\n\nAnglican bishops generally make use of the [[mitre]], [[crosier]], [[ecclesiastical ring]], purple [[cassock]], purple [[zucchetto]], and [[pectoral cross]]. However, the traditional [[choir dress]] of Anglican bishops retains its late mediaeval form, and looks quite different from that of their Catholic counterparts; it consists of a long [[rochet]] which is worn with a [[chimere]].\n\nIn the [[Eastern Churches]] ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Eastern Rite Catholic]]) a bishop will wear the [[mandyas]], [[panagia]] (and perhaps an [[enkolpion]]), [[sakkos]], [[omophorion]] and an Eastern-style [[mitre]]. Eastern bishops do not normally wear an episcopal ring; the faithful kiss (or, alternatively, touch their forehead to) the bishop's hand. To seal official documents, he will usually use an inked stamp. An Eastern bishop's coat of arms will normally display an Eastern-style mitre, cross, eastern style crosier and a red and white (or red and gold) [[Ecclesiastical heraldry#Mantle|mantle]]. The arms of [[Oriental Orthodox]] bishops will display the episcopal insignia (mitre or turban) specific to their own liturgical traditions. Variations occur based upon jurisdiction and national customs.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Jan Babjak SJ.jpg|[[Eastern Rite Catholic]] bishops celebrating [[Divine Liturgy]] in their proper [[pontifical vestments]]\nFile:Bishop Trevor Williams.jpg|An Anglican bishop with a crosier, wearing a rochet under a red chimere and cuffs, a black tippet, and a pectoral cross\nFile:BishopThom.jpg|An Episcopal bishop immediately before presiding at the Great Vigil of Easter in the [[narthex]] of St. Michael's Episcopal Cathedral in [[Boise, Idaho]].\nFile:Dom Lic\u00ednio Rangel.jpg|Catholic bishop dressed for the Sacrifice of the Mass.

Together with its [[suburb]]s and [[satellite town]]s, Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Urban Community of Bordeaux|Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]]. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBordeaux is the world's major wine industry capital. It is home to the world's main wine fair, [[Vinexpo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706075152/http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique/ |archivedate=6 July 2009}}</ref> and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year.

[[Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles]].]]\n\nIn historical times, around 567 BC it was the settlement of a [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]], the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], who named the town '''Burdigala''', probably of [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] origin. The name Bourde is still the name of a river south of the city.\n\nIn 107 BC, the [[Battle of Burdigala]] was fought by the Romans who were defending the [[Allobroges]], a [[Gauls|Gallic tribe]] allied to Rome, and the [[Tigurini]] led by [[Divico]]. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in the action.\n\nThe city fell under [[ancient Rome|Roman]] rule around 60 BC, its importance lying in the commerce of [[tin]] and [[lead]] towards Rome. Later it became capital of [[Gallia Aquitania|Roman Aquitaine]], flourishing especially during the [[Severan dynasty]] (3rd century). In 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. Further ravage was brought by the same Vandals in 409, the [[Visigoths]] in 414 and the [[Franks]] in 498, beginning a period of obscurity for the city.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century, the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585, a certain Gallactorius is cited as count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fighting the Basques.\n\nThe city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] in 732 after storming the fortified city and overwhelming the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force ready to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] outside Bordeaux, eventually taking them on in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne, described as taking a heavy death toll. After Duke Eudes's defeat, the Aquitanian duke could still save part of its troops and keep his grip on Aquitaine after the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]].\n\nIn 735, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion after his father Eudes's death, at which Charles responded by sending an expedition that captured and plundered Bordeaux again, but it was not retained for long. The following year, the Frankish commander descended again over Aquitaine, but clashed in battle with the Aquitanians and left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745, Aquitaine faced yet another expedition by Charles' sons Pepin and Carloman against Hunald, the Aquitanian ''princeps'' (or duke) strong in Bordeaux. Hunald was defeated, and his son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him, who in turn confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to King [[Pepin the Short]]'s troops. Next to Bordeaux, Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came over to vow loyalty to him (769).\n\nIn 778, [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] that very year. In 814, Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but he was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress or sympathise with a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were meant to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when the latter appeared c. 844 in the region of Bordeaux. In Autumn 845, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on the Vikings assaulting Bordeaux and Saintes, but was captured and put to death. No bishops were mentioned during the whole 8th century and part of the 9th in Bordeaux.\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] with the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who became, within months of their wedding, King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] was built. It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but in the end, after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453), it was annexed by France which extended its territory. The ''Ch\u00e2teau Trompette'' (Trumpet Castle) and the ''Fort du H\u00e2'', built by [[Charles VII of France]], were the symbols of the new domination, which however deprived the city of its wealth by halting the wine commerce with England.\n\nIn 1462, Bordeaux obtained a parliament, but regained importance only in the 16th century when it became the centre of the distribution of sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] along with the traditional wine.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n[[File:Edouard Manet 026.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c9douard Manet]]: ''Harbour at Bordeaux'', 1871]]\n[[File:Bordeaux rue Sainte-Catherine avril 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Rue Sainte-Catherine in 1905]]\n\nThe 18th century was the golden age of Bordeaux. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he once said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Baron Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nIn 1814, towards the end of the [[Peninsula war]], the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions, who seized Bordeaux without much resistance on 12 March. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and had a majority that supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This happened again during the [[World War I|First World War]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II|Second World War]], when it became clear that Paris would soon fall into German hands. However, on the last of these occasions the French capital was soon moved again to [[Vichy]]. In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBordeaux's climate is usually classified as an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') closely bordering on a [[Humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'') and considered subtropical by the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system (closely bordering a temperate climate in this classification). Moderate summer rainfall prevents its climate from being classified as [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]].\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter are commonplace, occurring several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages,

Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\nBordeaux now has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing ch\u00e2teaux and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> Bordeaux produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\nThe first growths are:\n\n*[[Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild|Ch\u00e2teau Lafite-Rothschild]]\n*[[Ch\u00e2teau Margaux]]\n*[[Ch\u00e2teau Latour]]\n*[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]\n*[[Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild|Ch\u00e2teau Mouton-Rothschild]]\n\n: In 1855, Mouton-Rothschild was ranked a Second Growth. In 1973, it was elevated to First Growth status.<ref>MacNeil, K. (2001). The Wine Bible. New York, NY: Workman.</ref>\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in Bordeaux. Red Bordeaux is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves#Sauternes AOC and Barsac AOC|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies.

The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry.

Then came [[Francois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round. This is an earthquake in Bordeaux, a city deeply rooted right traditions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the [[President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine]] Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

The city is home to 362 ''[[monuments historiques]]'' (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux has been inscribed on [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] as ''\"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\"''.\n\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], to have entered an era of [[urbanism]] and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first [[Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur]] then the Marquis de Tourny.\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n* ''[[Place des Quinconces]]'', the largest square in France.\n* ''Monument aux Girondins''\n* ''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre]]'', a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\n* ''All\u00e9es de Tourny''\n* ''Cours de l'Intendance''\n* ''Place du Chapelet''\n* ''[[Place de la Bourse]]''(1730\u20131775), designed by the Royal architect [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel|Jacques Ange Gabriel]] as landscape for an [[equestrian statue]] of Louis XV.\n* ''Place du Parlement''\n* ''Place Saint-Pierre''\n*''[[Pont de pierre (Bordeaux)|Pont de pierre]]''\n* ''Saint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral'', consecrated by [[Pope Urban II]] in 1096.

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|thumb|[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre]]]]\n\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n== Transport ==\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Pont de Pierre.jpg|thumb|Pont-de-Pierre]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the [[Pont Saint Jean]], just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the [[Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |author= |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe main [[railway station]], [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The [[TGV]] also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] ([[Spain]]) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the [[SNCF]] to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has 4 tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city center in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n[[File:A\u00e9roport Bx M\u00e9rignac.JPG|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n[[File:Bordeaux-lawn-track-&-vines1.jpg|thumb|Tramway in Bordeaux]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 3 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city center\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n===Bordeaux Public Transportation Statistics===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}}, while 8% travel for over {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_France_Bordeaux-924|title=Bordeaux Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=June 19, 2017}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>\n\n== Sport ==\n[[File:Bordeaux Stade Lescure entr\u00e9e.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Stade Chaban-Delmas]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe 41,458-capacity [[Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux]] is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th.

Bobble'''''|\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u30dc\u30d6\u30eb|Pazuru Boburu|lead=yes}}, also known as '''''Bust-a-Move''''' in North America, is a 1994 [[Tile-matching video game|tile-matching]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[puzzle video game]] for one or two players created by [[Taito Corporation]]. It is based on Taito's popular 1986 arcade game ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'', featuring characters and themes from that game. Its characteristically [[Kawaii|cute]] [[Anime|Japanese animation]] and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems.\n\nThe characters and theme of the game are based on the 1986 arcade game ''[[Bubble Bobble]]''. An arrangement of the original ''Bubble Bobble'' background music is played in the game's end credits.\n\n==Versions==\nTwo different versions of the original game were released. ''Puzzle Bobble'' was originally released in Japan only in June 1994 by Taito Corporation, running on Taito's [[Taito B System|B System]] hardware (with the preliminary title \"Bubble Buster\"). Then, 6 months later in December, the international Neo Geo version of ''Puzzle Bobble'' was released. It was almost identical aside from being in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] and having some different sound effects and translated text.\n\nWhen set to the US region, the Neo Geo version displays the alternative title \"Bust a Move\" and features [[Winners Don't Use Drugs|anti-drugs]] and anti-littering messages in the title sequence. The Bust-a-Move title was used for all subsequent games in the series in the United States and Canada, as well as for some (non-Taito published) console releases in Europe.\n\n==Gameplay==\nAt the start of each round, the rectangular playing arena contains a prearranged pattern of colored \"bubbles\". (These are actually referred to in the translation as \"balls\"; however, they were clearly intended to be bubbles, since they pop, and are taken from ''Bubble Bobble''.) At the bottom of the screen, the player controls a device called a \"pointer\", which aims and fires bubbles up the screen. The color of bubbles fired is randomly generated and chosen from the colors of bubbles still left on the screen.\n\nThe fired bubbles travel in straight lines (possibly bouncing off the side walls of the arena), stopping when they touch other bubbles or reach the top of the arena. If a bubble touches identically-colored bubbles, forming a group of three or more, those bubbles\u2014as well as any bubbles hanging from them\u2014are removed from the field of play, and points are awarded.\n\nAfter every few shots, the \"ceiling\" of the playing arena drops downwards slightly, along with all the bubbles stuck to it. The number of shots between each drop of the ceiling is influenced by the number of bubble colors remaining. The closer the bubbles get to the bottom of the screen, the faster the music plays and if they cross the line at the bottom then the game is over.\n\nThe objective of the game is to clear all the bubbles from the arena without any bubble crossing the bottom line. Bubbles will fire automatically if the player remains idle. After clearing the arena, the next round begins with a new pattern of bubbles to clear. The game consists of 32 levels.\n\n===Scoring system===\nAs with many popular arcade games, experienced players (who can complete the game relatively easily) become much more interested in the secondary challenge of obtaining a high score (which involves a lot more skill and strategy). ''Puzzle Bobble'' caters to this interest very well, featuring an exponential scoring system which allows extremely high scores to be achieved.\n\n\"Popped\" bubbles (that is, bubbles of the same color which disappear) are worth 10 points each. However, ''dropped'' bubbles (that is, bubbles that were hanging from popped bubbles), are worth far more: one dropped bubble scores 20 points; two score 40; three score 80. This figure continues doubling for each bubble dropped, up to 17 or more bubbles which scores 1,310,720 points. It is possible to achieve this maximum on most rounds (sometimes twice or more), resulting in a potential total score of 30 million and beyond.\n\nBonus points are also awarded for completing a round quickly. The maximum 50,000-point bonus is awarded for clearing a round in 5 seconds or less; this bonus then drops down to zero over the next minute, after which no bonus is awarded.\n\n===Two player mode===\nThere are no rounds in the two player game. Both players have an arena each (both visible on screen) and an identical arrangement of colored bubbles in each arena. When a player removes a large group (four bubbles or more) some of those removed are transferred to the opponent's arena, usually delaying their efforts to remove all the bubbles from their individual arena. In some versions, the two player game can also be played by one player against a computer opponent.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| EGM = 7.8/10 <small>(SNES)</small><ref name=\"EGM68\"/>\n| rev1 = ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]''\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4|5}} <small>(SNES and 3DO)</small><ref name=\"NG5\"/><ref name=\"NGen14\"/>\n}}\n\nReviewing the Super NES version, Mike Weigand of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' called it \"a thoroughly enjoyable and incredibly addicting puzzle game\". He considered the two player mode the highlight, but also said that the one player mode provides a solid challenge.<ref name=\"EGM68\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Bust A Move|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=68|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=March 1995|page=34}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]'' gave it a generally negative review, saying it \"starts out fun but ultimately lacks intricacy and longevity.\" They elaborated that in one player mode all the levels feel the same, and that two player matches are over too quickly to build up any excitement. They also criticized the lack of any 3D effects in the graphics.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Bust-A-Move|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=69 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1995|page=68}}</ref> ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the SNES version of the game, and stated that \"It's very simple, using only the control pad and one button to fire, and it's addictive as hell.\"<ref name=\"NG5\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=5|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=May 1995|page=101}}</ref>\n\nA reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', while questioning the continued viability of the action puzzle genre, admitted that the game is \"very simple and ''very'' addictive\". He remarked that though the 3DO version makes no significant additions, none are called for by a game with such simple enjoyment.<ref name=\"NGen14\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Bust a Move|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=14 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1996|page=167}}</ref> ''GamePro''{{'}}s brief review of the 3DO version commented, \"The move-and-shoot controls are very responsive and the simple visuals and music are well done.

Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce [[red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cell]]s, store [[mineral]]s, provide structure and support for the body, and enable [[animal locomotion|mobility]]. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple [[Function (biology)|functions]].\n\nBone tissue (osseous tissue) is a [[hard tissue]], a type of dense [[connective tissue]].  It has a [[honeycomb|honeycomb-like]] [[matrix (biology)|matrix]] internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity.  Bone tissue is made up of different types of [[bone cell]]s. [[Osteoblast]]s and [[osteocyte]]s are involved in the formation and [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of bone; [[osteoclast]]s are involved in the [[bone resorption|resorption]] of bone tissue. Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly [[collagen]] called ''[[ossein]]'' and an inorganic component of [[bone mineral]] made up of various salts. Bone tissue is a [[mineralized tissues|mineralized tissue]] of two types, [[Bone tissue#Structure|cortical bone]] and [[Bone tissue#Structure|cancellous bone]]. Other types of tissue found in bones include [[bone marrow]], [[endosteum]], [[periosteum]], [[nerve]]s, [[blood vessel]]s and [[cartilage]].\n\nIn the [[human body]] at birth, there are over 270 bones,<ref>{{cite book|title = The Anatomy and Biology of the Human Skeleton|author1=Steele, D.

The largest bone in the body is the [[femur]] or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the [[stapes]] in the [[middle ear]].\n\nThe Greek word for bone is \u1f40\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd (\"osteon\"), hence the many terms that use it as a prefix \u2013 such \nBone is the longest part of our body.\n\n==Structure==\n\n[[File:Bone cross-section.svg|thumb|left|240px|Cross-section of bone]]\nBone is not uniformly solid, but consists of a flexible [[matrix (biology)|matrix]] (about 30%) and bound minerals (about 70%) which are intricately woven and endlessly remodeled by a group of specialized bone cells. Their unique composition and design allows bones to be relatively [[Rockwell scale|hard]] and strong, while remaining lightweight.\n\nBone matrix is 90 to 95% composed of elastic [[collagen]] fibers, also known as ossein,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ossein|title=ossein|website=The Free Dictionary}}</ref> and the remainder is [[ground substance]].<ref name=\"Hall\">{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=John|title=Textbook of Medical Physiology|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-08089-2400-5|pages=957\u2013960|edition=12th}}</ref> The elasticity of [[collagen]] improves fracture resistance.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Nielsen\">{{Cite journal|author=Schmidt-Nielsen, Knut|authorlink=Knut Schmidt-Nielsen|year=1984|title=Scaling: Why Is Animal Size So Important?|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=6|isbn=0-521-31987-0|place=Cambridge}}</ref> The matrix is hardened by the binding of inorganic mineral salt [[calcium phosphate]] in a chemical arrangement known as calcium [[hydroxylapatite]]. It is the [[bone mineral|bone mineralization]] that give bones rigidity. \n\nBone is actively constructed and remodeled throughout life by special bone cells known as osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Within any single bone, the tissue is woven into two main patterns, known cortical and cancellous bone, and each with different appearance and characteristics.\n\n===Cortical bone===\n\n[[File:Illu compact spongy bone.jpg|thumb|Cross-section details of a long bone]]\nThe hard outer layer of bones is composed of [[cortical bone]] also called compact bone being much denser than cancellous bone. It forms the hard exterior (cortex) of bones. The cortical bone gives bone its smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult human [[skeleton]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} It facilitates bone's main functions: to support the whole body, protect organs, provide levers for movement, and store and release chemical elements, mainly calcium. It consists of multiple microscopic columns, each called an [[osteon]]. Each column is multiple layers of [[osteoblast]]s and [[osteocyte]]s around a central canal called the [[haversian canal]]. [[Volkmann's canal]]s at right angles connect the osteons together. The columns are metabolically active, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the cells within the osteon will change. Cortical bone is covered by a [[periosteum]] on its outer surface, and an [[endosteum]] on its inner surface. The endosteum is the boundary between the cortical bone and the cancellous bone.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=192}} The primary anatomical and functional unit of cortical bone is the [[osteon]].\n\n===Cancellous bone===\n\n[[File:Spongy bone - trabecules.jpg|thumb|Micrograph of cancellous bone]]\nCancellous bone, also called trabecular or spongy bone,{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=192}} is the internal tissue of the skeletal bone and is an open cell [[Porosity|porous]] network. Cancellous bone has a higher [[surface-area-to-volume ratio]] than cortical bone because it is less dense. This makes it weaker and more flexible. The greater surface area also makes it suitable for metabolic activities such as the exchange of calcium ions. Cancellous bone is typically found at the ends of long bones, near joints and in the interior of vertebrae. Cancellous bone is highly [[vascular]] and often contains red [[bone marrow]] where [[hematopoiesis]], the production of blood cells, occurs. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous bone is the [[trabecula]]. The trabeculae are aligned towards the mechanical load distribution that a bone experiences within long bones such as the [[femur]].  As far as short bones are concerned, trabecular alignment has been studied in the [[vertebral]] [[pedicle of vertebral arch|pedicle]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gdyczynski | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Manbachi | first2 = A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2014| title = On estimating the directionality distribution in pedicle trabecular bone from micro-CT images | url = | journal = Journal of Physiological Measurements | volume = 35 | issue = 12| pages = 2415\u20132428 | doi = 10.1088/0967-3334/35/12/2415 }}</ref> Thin formations of [[osteoblast]]s covered in endosteum create an irregular network of spaces,{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=195}} known as trabeculae.

These cells include [[osteoblast]]s, which are involved in the creation and [[mineralized tissue|mineralization]] of bone tissue, [[osteocytes]], and [[osteoclast]]s, which are involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are derived from [[osteoprogenitor]] cells, but [[osteoclast]]s are derived from the same cells that differentiate to form [[macrophage]]s and [[monocyte]]s.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=189}} Within the marrow of the bone there are also [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s. These cells give rise to other cells, including [[white blood cell]]s, [[red blood cell]]s, and [[platelet]]s.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=58}}\n\n====Osteoblast====\n[[File:Active osteoblasts.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph|Light micrograph]] of cancellous decalcified bone displaying osteoblasts actively synthesizing osteoid, containing two osteocytes.]][[Osteoblast]]s are mononucleate bone-forming cells. They are located on the surface of osteon seams and make a [[protein]] mixture known as [[osteoid]], which mineralizes to become bone.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|pp=189\u2013190}} The osteoid seam is a narrow region of newly formed organic matrix, not yet mineralized, located on the surface of a bone. Osteoid is primarily composed of Type I [[collagen]]. Osteoblasts also manufacture [[hormone]]s, such as [[prostaglandin]]s, to act on the bone itself. The osteoblast creates and repairs new bone by actually building around itself. First, the osteoblast puts up [[collagen]] fibers. These collagen fibers are used as a framework for the osteoblasts' work. The osteoblast then deposits calcium phosphate which is hardened by [[hydroxide]] and [[bicarbonate]] ions. The brand new bone created by the osteoblast is called [[osteoid]].<ref>Washington. \"The O' Cells.\" Bone Cells. University of Washington, n.d. Web. 03 Apr. 2013.</ref> Once the osteoblast is finished working it is actually trapped inside the bone once it hardens.

Web. 03 Apr. 2013.</ref> Other osteoblasts remain on the top of the new bone and are used to protect the underlying bone, these become known as lining cells.\n\n====Osteocyte====\n[[Osteocyte]]s are mostly inactive osteoblasts.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=189}} Osteocytes originate from osteoblasts that have migrated into and become trapped and surrounded by bone matrix that they themselves produced.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=192}} The spaces they occupy are known as [[lacuna (histology)|lacunae]]. Osteocytes have many processes that reach out to meet osteoblasts and other osteocytes probably for the purposes of communication.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Osteocytes remain in contact with other cells in the bone through gap junctions\u2014coupled cell processes\u2014which pass through small channels in the bone matrix called the [[canaliculus (bone)|canaliculi]].\n\n====Osteoclast====\n[[Osteoclast]]s are very large [[multinucleate]] cells that are responsible for the breakdown of bones by the process of [[bone resorption]]. New bone is then formed by the osteoblasts. Bone is constantly [[bone remodeling|remodelled]] by the resorption of osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=189}} Osteoclasts are large cells with multiple [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] located on bone surfaces in what are called ''Howship's lacunae'' (or ''resorption pits''). These lacunae are the result of surrounding bone tissue that has been reabsorbed.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=190}} Because the osteoclasts are derived from a [[monocyte]] [[stem cell|stem-cell]] lineage, they are equipped with [[Phagocytosis|phagocytic]]-like mechanisms similar to circulating [[macrophages]].{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=189}} Osteoclasts mature and/or migrate to discrete bone surfaces. Upon arrival, active enzymes, such as [[tartrate resistant acid phosphatase]], are [[Secretion|secreted]] against the mineral substrate.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts also plays a role in [[calcium]] [[homeostasis]].{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=190}}\n\n===Extracellular matrix===\nBones consist of living cells embedded in a mineralized organic matrix. This matrix consists of organic components, mainly [[Collagen#Types of collagen|type I collagen]] \u2013 \"organic\" referring to materials produced as a result of the human body \u2013 and inorganic components, primarily [[hydroxyapatite]] and other salts of [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]]. Above 30% of the acellular part of bone consists of the organic components, and 70% of salts.{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}} The [[collagen]] fibers give bone its [[ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]], and the interspersed crystals of [[hydroxyapatite]] give bone its [[compressive strength]]. These effects are [[synergy|synergistic]].{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}}\n\nThe inorganic composition of bone ([[bone mineral]]) is primarily formed from salts of [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]], the major salt being [[hydroxyapatite]] (Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>).{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}} The exact composition of the matrix may be subject to change over time due to nutrition and [[biomineralization]], with the ratio of [[calcium]] to [[phosphate]] varying between 1.3 and 2.0 (per weight), and trace minerals such as [[magnesium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and [[carbonate]] also being found.{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}}\n\n{{anchor|Woven vs. lamellar bone}}Type I collagen composes 90\u201395% of the organic matrix, with remainder of the matrix being a homogenous liquid called [[ground substance]] consisting of [[proteoglycan]]s such as [[hyaluronic acid]] and [[chondroitin sulfate]],{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}} as well as non-collagenous proteins such as [[osteocalcin]], [[osteopontin]] or [[bone sialoprotein]]. Collagen consists of strands of repeating units, which give bone tensile strength, and are arranged in an overlapping fashion that prevents shear stress. The function of ground substance is not fully known.{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}} Two types of bone can be identified microscopically according to the arrangement of collagen: woven and lamellar.\n* Woven bone, (also known as ''fibrous bone'') which is characterized by a haphazard organization of collagen fibers and is mechanically weak.<ref name=\"Curry2006\">Currey, John D. (2002). [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7313.html \"The Structure of Bone Tissue\"], pp.  12\u201314 in ''Bones: Structure and Mechanics''. Princeton University Press. Princeton, NJ. {{ISBN|9781400849505}}</ref>\n* Lamellar bone, which has a regular parallel alignment of collagen into sheets (\"lamellae\") and is mechanically strong.<ref name=\"Curry2006\" />\n\n[[File:Woven bone matrix.jpg|thumb|right|[[Transmission electron microscopy|Transmission]] [[electron micrograph]] of decalcified woven bone matrix displaying characteristic irregular orientation of collagen fibers.]]\nWoven bone is produced when osteoblasts produce osteoid rapidly, which occurs initially in all [[fetus|fetal]] bones, but is later replaced by more resilient lamellar bone. In adults woven bone is created after [[Bone fracture|fractures]] or in [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]]. Woven bone is weaker, with a smaller number of randomly oriented collagen fibers, but forms quickly; it is for this appearance of the fibrous matrix that the bone is termed ''woven''. It is soon replaced by lamellar bone, which is highly organized in [[concentric]] sheets with a much lower proportion of osteocytes to surrounding tissue. Lamellar bone, which makes its first appearance in humans in the [[fetus]] during the third trimester,<ref name=\"Salentijn\">Salentijn, L. ''Biology of Mineralized Tissues: Cartilage and Bone'', [[Columbia University College of Dental Medicine]] post-graduate dental lecture series, 2007</ref> is stronger and filled with many collagen fibers parallel to other fibers in the same layer (these parallel columns are called osteons).  In [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]], the fibers run in opposite directions in alternating layers, much like in [[plywood]], assisting in the bone's ability to resist [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] forces. After a fracture, woven bone forms initially and is gradually replaced by lamellar bone during a process known as \"bony substitution.\" Compared to woven bone, lamellar bone formation takes place more slowly. The orderly deposition of collagen fibers restricts the formation of osteoid to about 1 to 2&nbsp;[[Micrometre|\u00b5m]] per day. Lamellar bone also requires a relatively flat surface to lay the collagen fibers in parallel or concentric layers.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Deposition====\n\nThe extracellular matrix of bone is laid down by [[osteoblast]]s, which secrete both collagen and ground substance. These synthesise collagen within the cell, and then secrete collagen fibrils. The collagen fibers rapidly [[polymer]]ise to form collagen strands. At this stage they are not yet mineralised, and are called \"osteoid\". Around the strands calcium and phosphate [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] on the surface of these strands, within days to weeks becoming crystals of hydroxyapatite.{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}}\n\nIn order to mineralise the bone, the osteoblasts secrete [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] containing [[alkaline phosphatase]]. This cleaves the phosphate groups and acts as the foci for calcium and phosphate deposition. The vesicles then rupture and act as a centre for crystals to grow on. More particularly, bone mineral is formed from globular and plate structures.<ref name=r1>{{cite journal|author1=Bertazzo, S.  |author2=Bertran, C.

Other anatomical terms are also used to describe [[Anatomical terms of location|the location of bones]]. Like other anatomical terms, many of these derive from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Some anatomists still use Latin to refer to bones. The term \"osseous\", and the prefix \"osteo-\", referring to things related to bone, are still used commonly today.\n\nSome examples of terms used to describe bones include the term \"foramen\" to describe a hole through which something passes, and a \"canal\" or \"meatus\" to describe a tunnel-like structure. A protrusion from a bone can be called a number of terms, including a \"condyle\", \"crest\", \"spine\", \"eminence\", \"tubercle\" or \"tuberosity\", depending on the protrusion's shape and location. In general, [[long bone]]s are said to have a \"head\", \"neck\", and \"body\".\n\nWhen two bones join together, they are said to \"articulate\". If the two bones have a fibrous connection and are relatively immobile, then the joint is called a \"suture\".\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Bone growth.png|300px|thumb|left|Endochondral ossification]]\n[[File:Bone (1).jpg|thumb|Section through a juvenile knee joint (rat) showing the cartilagineous growth plates]]\nThe formation of bone is called [[ossification]]. During the [[prenatal development|fetal stage of development]] this occurs by two processes: [[intramembranous ossification]] and [[endochondral ossification]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Intramembranous ossification involves the formation of bone from [[connective tissue]] whereas endochondral ossification involves the formation of bone from [[cartilage]].\n\n'''Intramembranous ossification''' mainly occurs during formation of the flat bones of the [[skull]] but also the mandible, maxilla, and clavicles; the bone is formed from connective tissue such as [[mesenchyme]] tissue rather than from cartilage. The process includes: the development of the [[ossification center]], [[calcification]], trabeculae formation and the development of the periosteum.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n'''Endochondral ossification''' occurs in long bones and most other bones in the body; it involves the development of bone from cartilage. This process includes the development of a cartilage model, its growth and development, development of the [[ossification center|primary and secondary ossification centers]], and the formation of articular cartilage and the [[epiphyseal plate]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nEndochondral ossification begins with points in the cartilage called \"primary ossification centers.\" They mostly appear during fetal development, though a few short bones begin their primary ossification after [[birth]]. They are responsible for the formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones and certain parts of irregular bones. Secondary ossification occurs after birth, and forms the [[Epiphysis|epiphyses]] of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones. The diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the [[epiphyseal plate]]). At skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together (epiphyseal closure).{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In the upper limbs, only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossified.

As bone formation actively ''fixes'' circulating calcium in its mineral form, removing it from the bloodstream, resorption actively ''unfixes'' it thereby increasing circulating calcium levels. These processes occur in tandem at site-specific locations.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n===Remodeling===\n{{Main article|Bone remodeling}}\nBone is constantly being created and replaced in a process known as [[Bone remodeling|remodeling]]. This ongoing turnover of bone is a process of resorption followed by replacement of bone with little change in shape. This is accomplished through osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Cells are stimulated by a variety of [[paracrine|signals]], and together referred to as a remodeling unit. Approximately 10% of the skeletal mass of an adult is remodelled each year.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Manolagas|first1=SC|title=Birth and death of bone cells: basic regulatory mechanisms and implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of osteoporosis.|journal=Endocrine Reviews|date=April 2000|volume=21|issue=2|pages=115\u201337|pmid=10782361|doi=10.1210/edrv.21.2.0395}}</ref> The purpose of remodeling is to regulate [[calcium homeostasis]], repair [[Microdamage in bone|microdamaged bones]] from everyday stress, and to shape the skeleton during growth.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Repeated stress, such as weight-bearing [[exercise]] or bone healing, results in the bone thickening at the points of maximum stress ([[Wolff's law]]).

The cells also use [[paracrine signalling]] to control the activity of each other.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} For example, the rate at which osteoclasts resorb bone is inhibited by [[calcitonin]] and [[osteoprotegerin]].  Calcitonin is produced by [[parafollicular cell]]s in the [[thyroid gland]], and can bind to receptors on osteoclasts to directly inhibit osteoclast activity. Osteoprotegerin is secreted by osteoblasts and is able to bind RANK-L, inhibiting osteoclast stimulation.<ref name = Boron/>\n\nOsteoblasts can also be stimulated to increase bone mass through increased secretion of [[osteoid]] and by [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibiting]] the ability of osteoclasts to break down [[osseous tissue]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Increased secretion of osteoid is stimulated by the secretion of [[growth hormone]] by the [[pituitary]], [[thyroid hormone]] and the sex hormones ([[estrogen]]s and [[androgen]]s).

[[Vitamin D]], [[parathyroid hormone]] and stimulation from osteocytes induce osteoblasts to increase secretion of RANK-[[ligand]] and [[interleukin 6]], which cytokines then stimulate increased reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts.

Cancers of the bone marrow inside the bone can also affect bone tissue, examples including [[leukemia]] and [[multiple myeloma]]. Bone may also be affected by cancers in other parts of the body. Cancers in other parts of the body may release [[parathyroid hormone]] or [[parathyroid hormone-related peptide]]. This increases bone reabsorption, and can lead to bone fractures.\n\nBone tissue that is destroyed or altered as a result of cancers is distorted, weakened, and more prone to fracture. This may lead to compression of the [[spinal cord]], destruction of the marrow resulting in [[bruising]], [[bleeding]] and [[immunosuppression]], and is one cause of bone pain. If the cancer is metastatic, then there might be other symptoms depending on the site of the original cancer. Some bone cancers can also be felt.\n\nCancers of the bone are managed according to their type, their [[cancer staging|stage]], prognosis, and what symptoms they cause.

The first record comes from the late 9th-century ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''. It is given to some of the rulers of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] from the 5th century onwards who had achieved overlordship of some or all of the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. It is unclear whether the word dates back to the 5th century and was used by the kings themselves or whether it is a later, 9th-century, invention. The term ''bretwalda'' also appears in a 10th-century charter of [[Athelstan of England|\u00c6thelstan]]. The literal meaning of the word is disputed and may translate to either 'wide-ruler' or 'Britain-ruler'.\n\nThe rulers of [[Mercia]] were generally the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kings from the mid 7th century to the early 9th century but are not accorded the title of ''bretwalda'' by the ''Chronicle'', which had an anti-Mercian bias. The ''[[Annals of Wales]]'' continued to recognise the [[List of monarchs of Northumbria|kings of Northumbria]] as \"Kings of the Saxons\" until the death of [[Osred I of Northumbria]] in 716.\n\n==Bretwaldas==\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon England 2.svg|thumb|The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]]\n\n===Listed by Bede and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''===\n[[File:Edwin - John Speed.JPG|thumb|An imaginary depiction of Edwin of Northumbria, from [[John Speed|John Speed's]] ''Saxon Heptarchy'' (1611)]]\n* [[\u00c6lle of Sussex]] (488\u2013[[circa|c.]] 514)\n* [[Ceawlin of Wessex]] (560\u2013592, died 593)\n* [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] (590\u2013616)\n* [[R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia]] (c. 600\u2013around 624)\n* [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin of Deira]] (616\u2013633)\n* [[Oswald of Northumbria]] (633\u2013642)\n* [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] (642\u2013670)\n\n===Mercian rulers with similar or greater authority===\n* [[Penda of Mercia]] (628/633\u2013655)\n* [[Wulfhere of Mercia]] (658\u2013675)\n* [[\u00c6thelred of Mercia]] (675\u2013704, died 716)\n* [[\u00c6thelbald of Mercia]] (716\u2013757)\n* [[Offa of Mercia]] (757\u2013796)\n* [[Coenwulf of Mercia|C\u0153nwulf of Mercia]] (796\u2013821)\n\n===Listed only by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''===\n* [[Egbert of Wessex]] (829\u2013839)\n* [[Alfred of Wessex]] (871\u2013899)\n\n===Other claimants===\n* [[\u00c6thelstan|\u00c6thelstan of Wessex]] (927\u2013939)\n\n==Etymology==\nThe first syllable of the term ''bretwalda'' may be related to [[Britons (historical)|''Briton'']] or ''Britain''. The second element is taken to mean 'ruler' or '[[sovereign]]', though is more literally 'wielder'.

Bede wrote in [[Latin]] and never used the term and his list of kings holding ''imperium'' should be treated with caution, not least in that he overlooks kings such as [[Penda of Mercia]], who clearly held some kind of dominance during his reign. Similarly, in his list of bretwaldas, the West Saxon chronicler ignored such [[List of monarchs of Mercia|Mercian kings]] as [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]].\n\nThe use of the term ''Bretwalda'' was the attempt by a West Saxon chronicler to make some claim of [[List of monarchs of Wessex|West Saxon kings]] to the whole of Great Britain. The concept of the overlordship of the whole of Britain was at least recognised in the period, whatever was meant by the term. Quite possibly it was a survival of a Roman concept of \"Britain\": it is significant that, while the hyperbolic inscriptions on coins and titles in [[charters]] often included the title ''rex Britanniae'', when England was unified the title used was ''rex Angulsaxonum'', ('king of the Anglo-Saxons'.)\n\n==Modern interpretation by historians==\nFor some time, the existence of the word ''bretwalda'' in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which was based in part on the list given by [[Bede]] in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', led historians to think that there was perhaps a \"title\" held by Anglo-Saxon overlords. This was particularly attractive as it would lay the foundations for the establishment of an English monarchy. The 20th-century historian [[Frank Stenton]] said of the Anglo-Saxon chronicler that \"his inaccuracy is more than compensated by his preservation of the English title applied to these outstanding kings\".<ref>{{Citation | first = F. M. | last = Stenton | title = Anglo-Saxon England | edition = 3rd | place = Oxford | publisher = University Press | year = 1971 | pages = 34\u201335}}.</ref> He argued that the term ''bretwalda'' \"falls into line with the other evidence which points to the Germanic origin of the earliest English institutions\".\n\nOver the later 20th century, this assumption was increasingly challenged. [[Patrick Wormald]] interpreted it as \"less an objectively realized office than a subjectively perceived status\" and emphasised the partiality of its usage in favour of [[Southumbrian]] rulers.<ref>{{Citation | first = Patrick | last = Wormald | title = Bede, ''Bretwaldas'' and the Origins of the ''Gens Anglorum'' | pages = 118\u2013119}}.</ref> In 1991, Steven Fanning argued that \"it is unlikely that the term ever existed as a title or was in common usage in Anglo-Saxon England\".<ref name = \"Fanning\">{{Citation | last = Fanning | first = Steven | contribution = Bede, ''Imperium'', and the Bretwaldas | title = Speculum | volume = 66 | number = 1 | year = 1991}}.</ref>{{rp |24}}  The fact that Bede never mentioned a special title for the kings in his list implies that he was unaware of one.<ref name = \"Fanning\" />{{rp |23}}  In 1995, [[Simon Keynes]] observed that \"if Bede's concept of the Southumbrian overlord, and the chronicler's concept of the 'Bretwalda', are to be regarded as artificial constructs, which have no validity outside the context of the literary works in which they appear, we are released from the assumptions about political development which they seem to involve... we might ask whether kings in the eighth and ninth centuries were quite so obsessed with the establishment of a pan-Southumbrian state\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Simon | last = Keynes | contribution = England, 700\u2013900 | title = The New Cambridge Medieval History | volume = II, c. 700 \u2013 c. 900 | editor-first = R. | editor-last = McKitterick | place = Cambridge | publisher = University Press | year = 1995 | page = 39}}.</ref>\n\nModern interpretations view the concept of ''bretwalda'' overlordship as complex and an important indicator of how a 9th-century chronicler interpreted history and attempted to insert the increasingly powerful Saxon kings into that history.\n\n==Overlordship==\nA complex array of dominance and subservience existed during the Anglo-Saxon period. A king who used [[Anglo-Saxon Charters|charters]] to grant land in another kingdom indicated such a relationship. If a king held sway over a large kingdom, such as when the Mercians dominated the [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglians]], the relationship would have been more equal than in the case of the Mercian dominance of the [[Hwicce]], which was a comparatively small kingdom. Mercia was arguably the most powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom for much of the late 7th though 8th centuries, though Mercian kings are missing from the two main \"lists\". For Bede, Mercia was a traditional enemy of his native Northumbria and he regarded powerful kings such as the pagan Penda as standing in the way of the Christian conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. Bede omits them from his list, even though it is evident that Penda held a considerable degree of power. Similarly powerful Mercia kings such as Offa are missed out of the West Saxon ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their kings to rule over other Anglo-Saxon peoples.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Fanning, Steven. \"Bede, ''Imperium'', and the Bretwaldas.\" ''Speculum'' 66 (1991): 1\u201326.\n* Wormald, Patrick. \"Bede, the ''Bretwaldas'' and the Origins of the ''Gens Anglorum''.\" In ''Ideal and Reality in Frankish and Anglo-Saxon Society'', ed.

In economics, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem and its extension, the [[Kakutani fixed-point theorem]], play a central role in the [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model|proof of existence]] of [[general equilibrium]] in market economies as developed in the 1950s by economics Nobel prize winners [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[G\u00e9rard Debreu]].\n\nThe theorem was first studied in view of work on differential equations by the French mathematicians around [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Charles \u00c9mile Picard]].

The following examples show why the pre-conditions are important.\n\n===Boundedness===\nConsider the function\n:<math>f(x) = x+1</math>\nwhich is a continuous function from <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> to itself. As it shifts every point to the right, it cannot have a fixed point. Note that <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> is convex and closed, but not bounded.\n\n===Closedness===\nConsider the function\n:<math>f(x) = \\frac{x+1}2</math>\nwhich is a continuous function from the open interval (\u22121,1) to itself. In this interval, it shifts every point to the right, so it cannot have a fixed point. Note that (\u22121,1) is convex and bounded, but not closed. The function ''f''  ''does'' have a fixed point for the closed interval [\u22121,1], namely ''f''(1) = 1.\n\n===Convexity===\nNote that convexity is not strictly necessary for BFPT. Because the properties involved (continuity, being a fixed point) are invariant under [[homeomorphism]]s, BFPT is equivalent to forms in which the domain is required to be a closed unit ball <math>D^n</math>. For the same reason it holds for every set that is homeomorphic to a closed ball (and therefore also [[closed set|closed]], bounded, [[connected space|connected]], [[simply connected|without holes]], etc.).\n\nThe following example shows that BFPT doesn't work for domains with holes. Consider the following function, defined in polar coordinates:\n:<math>f(r,\\theta)=(r,\\theta+\\pi/4)</math>\nwhich is a continuous function from the unit circle to itself. It rotates every point on the unit circle 45 degrees counterclockwise, so it cannot have a fixed point. Note that the unit circle is closed and bounded, but it has a hole (and so it is not convex). The function ''f''  ''does'' have a fixed point for the unit disc, since it takes the origin to itself.\n\nA formal generalization of BFPT for \"hole-free\" domains can be derived from the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/323841/why-is-convexity-a-requirement-for-brouwer-fixed-points-shouldnt-no-holes-be | title=Why is convexity a requirement for Brouwer fixed points? | publisher=Math StackExchange | accessdate=22 May 2015 | author=Belk, Jim}}</ref>\n\n===Notes===\nThe continuous function in this theorem is not required to be [[bijective]] or even [[surjective]].\n\n==Illustrations==\nThe theorem has several \"real world\" illustrations. Here are some examples.\n\n1. Take two sheets of graph paper of equal size with coordinate systems on them, lay one flat on the table and crumple up (without ripping or tearing) the other one and place it, in any fashion, on top of the first so that the crumpled paper does not reach outside the flat one. There will then be at least one point of the crumpled sheet that lies directly above its corresponding point (i.e. the point with the same coordinates) of the flat sheet. This is a consequence of the ''n'' = 2 case of Brouwer's theorem applied to the continuous map that assigns to the coordinates of every point of the crumpled sheet the coordinates of the point of the flat sheet immediately beneath it.\n\n2. Take an ordinary map of a country, and suppose that that map is laid out on a table inside that country.  There will always be a \"You are Here\" point on the map which represents that same point in the country.\n\n3. In three dimensions a consequence of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem is that, no matter how much you stir a cocktail in a glass (or think about milk shake), when the liquid has come to rest, some point in the liquid will end up in exactly the same place in the glass as before you took any action, assuming that the final position of each point is a continuous function of its original position, that the liquid after stirring is contained within the space originally taken up by it, and that the glass (and stirred surface shape) maintain a convex volume.  Ordering a cocktail [[shaken, not stirred]] defeats the convexity condition (\"shaking\" being defined as a dynamic series of non-convex inertial containment states in the vacant headspace under a lid).  In that case, the theorem would not apply, and thus all points of the liquid disposition are potentially displaced from the original state. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Intuitive approach==\n\n===Explanations attributed to Brouwer===\nThe theorem is supposed to have originated from Brouwer's observation of a cup of coffee.<ref>The interest of this anecdote rests in its intuitive and didactic character, but its accuracy is dubious. As the history section shows, the origin of the theorem is not Brouwer's work. More than 20 years earlier [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] had proved an equivalent result, and 5 years before Brouwer P.&nbsp;Bohl had proved the three-dimensional case.</ref>\nIf one stirs to dissolve a lump of sugar, it appears there is always a point without motion.\nHe drew the conclusion that at any moment, there is a point on the surface that is not moving.<ref name=Arte>This citation comes originally from a television broadcast: ''[https://archive.is/20130113210953/http://archives.arte.tv/hebdo/archimed/19990921/ftext/sujet5.html Archim\u00e8de]'', [[Arte]], 21 septembre 1999</ref>\nThe fixed point is not necessarily the point that seems to be motionless, since the centre of the turbulence moves a little bit.\nThe result is not intuitive, since the original fixed point may become mobile when another fixed point appears.\n\nBrouwer is said to have added: \"I can formulate this splendid result different, I take a horizontal sheet, and another identical one which I crumple, flatten and place on the other. Then a point of the crumpled sheet is in the same place as on the other sheet.\"<ref name=Arte />\nBrouwer \"flattens\" his sheet as with a flat iron, without removing the folds and wrinkles. This example is better than the coffee cup one as it shows that uniqueness of the fixed point may fail. This distinguishes Brouwer's result from other fixed-point theorems, such as [[Stefan Banach]]'s, that guarantee uniqueness.\n\n===One-dimensional case===\n[[File:Th\u00e9or\u00e8me-de-Brouwer-dim-1.svg|200px|right]]\nIn one dimension, the result is intuitive and easy to prove.  The continuous function ''f'' is defined on a closed interval [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] and takes values in the same interval.  Saying that this function has a fixed point amounts to saying that its graph (dark green in the figure on the right) intersects that of the function defined on the same interval [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] which maps ''x'' to ''x'' (light green).\n\nIntuitively, any continuous line from the left edge of the square to the right edge must necessarily intersect the green diagonal.  To prove this, consider the function ''g'' which maps ''x'' to ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;-&nbsp;''x''. It is \u2265&nbsp;0 on ''a'' and \u2264&nbsp;0 on&nbsp;''b''.  By the [[intermediate value theorem]], ''g'' has a [[Root of a function|zero]] in [''a'',&nbsp;''b'']; this zero is a fixed point.\n\nBrouwer is said to have expressed this as follows: \"Instead of examining a surface, we will prove the theorem about a piece of string. Let us begin with the string in an unfolded state, then refold it. Let us flatten the refolded string. Again a point of the string has not changed its position with respect to its original position on the unfolded string.\"<ref name=Arte />\n\n==History==\nThe Brouwer fixed point theorem was one of the early achievements of [[algebraic topology]], and is the basis of more general [[fixed point theorem]]s which are important in [[functional analysis]].

In mathematical language, if \u03b5 is chosen to be very small, Scarf's algorithm can be used to find a point ''x'' such that ''f(x)'' is very close to ''x'', i.e., <math>d(f(x),x) < \\varepsilon</math>. But Scarf's algorithm cannot be used to find a point ''x'' such that ''x'' is very close to a fixed point: we cannot guarantee <math>d(x,y) < \\varepsilon</math>, where <math>f(y)=y</math>. Often this latter condition is what is meant by the informal phrase \"approximating a fixed point.\"\n\n==Proof outlines==\n\n===A proof using degree===\nBrouwer's original 1911 proof relied on the notion of the [[degree of a continuous mapping]].  Modern accounts of the proof can also be found in the literature.<ref>{{citation | last = Teschl| first = Gerald| authorlink = Gerald Teschl| title = Topics in Real and Functional Analysis| url = http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~gerald/ftp/book-fa/index.html|chapter=14.4: The Brouwer fixed point theorem|year=2005|accessdate=2016-03-08}}</ref>\n\nLet <math>K=\\overline{B(0)}</math> denote the closed unit ball in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> centered at the origin.  Suppose for simplicitly that <math>f:K\\to K</math> is continuously differentiable.  A [[regular value]] of <math>f</math> is a point <math>p\\in B(0)</math> such that the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of <math>f</math> is non-singular at every point of the preimage of <math>p</math>.  In particular, by the [[inverse function theorem]], every point of the preimage of <math>f</math> lies in <math>B(0)</math> (the interior of <math>K</math>).  The degree of <math>f</math> at a regular value <math>p\\in B(0)</math> is defined as the sum of the signs of the [[Jacobian determinant]] of <math>f</math> over the preimages of <math>p</math> under <math>f</math>:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{deg}_p(f) = \\sum_{x\\in f^{-1}(p)} \\operatorname{sign}\\left(\\det(Df(x))\\right).</math>\n\nThe degree is, roughly speaking, the number of \"sheets\" of the preimage ''f'' lying over a small open set around ''p'', with sheets counted oppositely if they are oppositely oriented.  This is thus a generalization of [[winding number]] to higher dimensions.\n\nThe degree satisfies the property of ''homotopy invariance'': let <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> be two continuously differentiable functions, and <math>H_t(x)=tf+(1-t)g</math> for <math>0\\le t\\le 1</math>.  Suppose that the point <math>p</math> is a regular value of <math>H_t</math> for all ''t''.  Then <math>\\deg_p f = \\deg_p g</math>.\n\nIf there is no fixed point of the boundary of <math>K</math>, then the function \n:<math>g(x)=\\frac{x-f(x)}{\\sup_{x\\in K}\\left|x-f(x)\\right|}</math>\n\nis well-defined, and \n\n<math>H(t,x) = \\frac{x-tf(x)}{\\sup_{x\\in K}\\left|x-tf(x)\\right|}</math>\n\ndefines a homotopy from the identity function to it.  The identity function has degree one at every point.  In particular, the identity function has degree one at the origin, so <math>g</math> also has degree one at the origin.  As a consequence, the preimage <math>g^{-1}(0)</math> is not empty.  The elements of <math>g^{-1}(0)</math> are precisely the fixed points of the original function ''f''.\n\nThis requires some work to make fully general.  The definition of degree must be extended to singular values of ''f'', and then to continuous functions.  The more modern advent of [[homology theory]] simplifies the construction of the degree, and so has become a standard proof in the literature.\n\n===A proof using homology===\nThe proof uses the observation that the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of ''D''<sup>\u2009''n''</sup> is ''S''<sup>\u2009''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sup>, the (''n'' \u2212 1)-[[sphere]].\n\n[[Image:Brouwer fixed point theorem retraction.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of the retraction ''F'']]\nThe argument proceeds by contradiction, supposing that a continuous function ''f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''D''<sup>\u2009''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''D''<sup>\u2009''n''</sup> has ''no'' fixed point, and then attempting to derive an inconsistency, which proves that the function must in fact have a fixed point. For each ''x'' in ''D''<sup>\u2009''n''</sup>, there is only one straight line that passes through ''f''(''x'') and ''x'', because it must be the case that ''f''(''x'') and ''x'' are distinct by hypothesis (recall that ''f'' having no fixed points means that ''f''(''x'') \u2260 ''x''). Following this line from ''f''(''x'') through ''x'' leads to a point on ''S''<sup>\u2009''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sup>, denoted by ''F''(''x''). This defines a continuous function ''F''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''D''<sup>\u2009''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''S''<sup>\u2009''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sup>, which is a special type of continuous function known as a [[retract]]ion: every point of the [[codomain]] (in this case ''S''<sup>\u2009''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sup>) is a fixed point of the function.\n\nIntuitively it seems unlikely that there could be a retraction of ''D''<sup>\u2009''n''</sup> onto ''S''<sup>\u2009''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sup>, and in the case ''n'' = 1 it is obviously impossible because ''S''<sup>\u20090</sup> (i.e., the endpoints of the closed interval ''D''<sup>\u20091</sup>) is not even connected. The case ''n'' = 2 is less obvious, but can be proven by using basic arguments involving the [[fundamental group]]s of the respective spaces: the retraction would induce an injective [[group homomorphism]] from the fundamental group of ''S''<sup>\u20091</sup> to that of ''D''<sup>\u20092</sup>, but the first group is isomorphic to '''Z''' while the latter group is trivial, so this is impossible. The case ''n'' = 2 can also be proven by contradiction based on a theorem about non-vanishing [[vector field]]s.\n\nFor ''n'' > 2, however, proving the impossibility of the retraction is more difficult. One way is to make use of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology groups]]:  the homology ''H''<sub>''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sub>(''D''<sup>\u2009''n''</sup>) is trivial, while ''H''<sub>''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sub>(''S''<sup>&nbsp;''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091</sup>) is infinite [[cyclic group|cyclic]]. This shows that the retraction is impossible, because again the retraction would induce an injective group homomorphism from the latter to the former group.\n\n===A proof using Stokes's theorem===\nTo prove that a map has fixed points, one can assume that it is smooth, because if a map has no fixed points then convolving it with a smooth function of sufficiently small support and integral equal to one produces a smooth function with no fixed points. As in the proof using homology, one is reduced to proving that there is no smooth retraction ''F'' from the ball ''B'' onto its boundary ''\u2202B''. If \u03c9 is a volume form on the boundary then by [[Stokes Theorem]],\n:<math>0<\\int_{\\partial B}\\omega = \\int_{\\partial B}F^*(\\omega) = \\int_BdF^*(\\omega)= \\int_BF^*(d\\omega)=\\int_BF^*(0) = 0</math>\ngiving a contradiction.\n\nMore generally, this shows that there is no smooth retraction from any non-empty smooth orientable compact manifold onto its boundary. The proof using Stokes's theorem is closely related to the proof using homology (or rather cohomology), because the form \u03c9 generates the de Rham cohomology group ''H''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>(''\u2202B'') used in the cohomology proof.\n\n===A combinatorial proof===\nThe BFPT can be proved using [[Sperner's lemma]]. We now give an outline of the proof for the special case in which ''f'' is a function from the standard ''n''-[[simplex]], <math>\\Delta^n,</math> to itself, where\n\n:<math>\\Delta^n = \\left\\{P\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\mid\\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{P_i} = 1 \\text{ and } P_i \\ge 0 \\text{ for all } i\\right\\}.</math>\n\nFor every point <math>P\\in \\Delta^n,</math> also <math>f(P)\\in \\Delta^n.</math> Hence the sum of their coordinates is equal:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{P_i} = 1 = \\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{f(P)_i}</math>\n\nHence, by the pigeonhole principle, for every <math>P\\in \\Delta^n,</math> there must be an index <math>j \\in \\{0, \\ldots, n\\}</math> such that the <math>j</math>th coordinate of <math>P</math> is greater than or equal to the <math>j</math>th coordinate of its image under ''f'':\n\n:<math>P_j \\geq f(P)_j.</math>\n\nMoreover, if <math>P</math> lies on a ''k''-dimensional sub-face of <math>\\Delta^n,</math> then by the same argument, the index <math>j</math> can be selected from among the {{nowrap|''k'' + 1}} coordinates which are not zero on this sub-face.\n\nWe now use this fact to construct a Sperner coloring.  For every triangulation of <math>\\Delta^n,</math> the color of every vertex <math>P</math> is an index <math>j</math> such that <math>f(P)_j \\leq P_j.</math>\n\nBy construction, this is a Sperner coloring. Hence, by Sperner's lemma, there is an ''n''-dimensional simplex whose vertices are colored with the entire set of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} available colors.\n\nBecause ''f'' is continuous, this simplex can be made arbitrarily small by choosing an arbitrarily fine triangulation. Hence, there must be a point <math>P</math> which satisfies the labeling condition in all coordinates: <math>f(P)_j \\leq P_j</math> for all <math>j.</math>\n\nBecause the sum of the coordinates of <math>P</math> and <math>f(P)</math> must be equal, all these inequalities must actually be equalities. But this means that:\n\n:<math>f(P) = P.</math>\n\nThat is, <math>P</math> is a fixed point of <math>f.</math>\n\n===A proof by Hirsch===\nThere is also a quick proof, by [[Morris Hirsch]], based on the impossibility of a differentiable retraction.  The [[indirect proof]] starts by noting that the map ''f'' can be approximated by a smooth map retaining the property of not fixing a point; this can be done by using the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]], for example.  One then defines a retraction as above which must now be differentiable.  Such a retraction must have a non-singular value, by [[Sard's theorem]], which is also non-singular for the restriction to the boundary (which is just the identity).  Thus the inverse image would be a 1-manifold with boundary. The boundary would have to contain at least two end points, both of which would have to lie on the boundary of the original ball\u2014which is impossible in a retraction.\n\n{{harv|Kellogg|Li|Yorke|1976}} turned Hirsch's proof into a [[Computability|computable]] proof by observing that the retract is in fact defined everywhere except at the fixed points. For almost any point, ''q'', on the boundary, (assuming it is not a fixed point) the one manifold with boundary mentioned above does exist and the only possibility is that it leads from ''q'' to a fixed point. It is an easy numerical task to follow such a path from ''q'' to the fixed point so the method is essentially computable. {{harv|Chow|Mallet-Paret|Yorke|1978}} gave a conceptually similar path-following version of the homotopy proof which extends to a wide variety of related problems.\n\n===A proof using the ''oriented area''===\nA variation of the preceding proof does not employ the Sard's theorem, and goes as follows. If <math>r\\colon B\\to \\partial B</math> is a smooth retraction, one considers the smooth deformation <math>g^t(x):=t\\, r(x)+(1-t)x</math>, and the smooth function\n:<math>\\varphi(t):=\\int_B \\operatorname{det} D g^t(x) dx</math>\nDifferentiating under the sign of integral it is not difficult to check that ''\u03c6\u2032(t)=0'' for all ''t'', so ''\u03c6'' is a constant function, which is a contradiction because ''\u03c6(0)'' is the ''n''-dimensional volume of the ball, while ''\u03c6(1)'' is zero.  The geometric idea is that ''\u03c6(t)'' is the oriented area of ''g<sup>t</sup>(B)'' (that is, the Lebesgue measure of the image of the ball via ''g<sup>t</sup>'', taking into account multiplicity and orientation), and should remain constant (as it is very clear in the one-dimensional case). On the other hand, as the parameter ''t'' passes form ''0'' to ''1'' the map ''g<sup>t</sup>'' transforms continuously from the identity map of the ball, to the retraction ''r'', which is a contradiction since the oriented area of the identity coincides with the volume of the ball, while the oriented area of ''r'' is necessarily ''0'', as its image is the boundary of the ball, a set of null measure.\n\n===A proof using the game hex===\nA quite different proof given by [[David Gale]] is based on the game of [[Hex (board game)|Hex]].  The basic theorem about Hex is that no game can end in a draw.  This is equivalent to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem for dimension 2.  By considering ''n''-dimensional versions of Hex, one can prove in general that Brouwer's theorem is equivalent to the [[determinacy]] theorem for Hex.<ref>{{cite journal|author=David Gale |year=1979|title=The Game of Hex and Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem | journal=The American Mathematical Monthly | volume=86 | pages=818\u2013827|doi=10.2307/2320146|jstor=2320146|issue=10}}</ref>\n\n===A proof using the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem===\nThe Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says that if a continuous map ''f'' from a finite simplicial complex ''B'' to itself has only isolated fixed points, then the number of fixed points counted with multiplicities (which may be negative) is equal to the Lefschetz number\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\sum_n(-1)^n\\operatorname{Tr}(f|H_n(B))</math>\nand in particular if the Lefschetz number is nonzero then ''f'' must have a fixed point. If ''B'' is a ball (or more generally is contractible) then the Lefschetz number is one because the only non-zero homology group is :<math>H_0(B)</math> and ''f'' acts as the identity on this group, so ''f'' has a fixed point.\n\n===A proof in a weak logical system===\nIn [[reverse mathematics]], Brouwer's theorem can be proved in the system [[Weak K\u00f6nig's lemma|WKL<sub>0</sub>]], and conversely over the base system [[reverse mathematics|RCA<sub>0</sub>]] Brouwer's theorem for a square implies the [[weak K\u00f6nig's lemma]], so this gives a precise description of the strength of Brouwer's theorem.\n\n==Generalizations==\nThe Brouwer fixed-point theorem forms the starting point of a number of more general [[fixed-point theorem]]s.\n\nThe straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions, i.e. using the unit ball of an arbitrary [[Hilbert space]] instead of Euclidean space, is not true. The main problem here is that the unit balls of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not [[compact space|compact]]. For example, in the Hilbert space [[Lp space|\u2113<sup>2</sup>]] of square-summable real (or complex) sequences, consider the map ''f'' : \u2113<sup>2</sup> \u2192 \u2113<sup>2</sup> which sends a sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) from the closed unit ball of \u2113<sup>2</sup> to the sequence (''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) defined by\n:<math>y_0=\\sqrt{1-\\|x\\|_2^2}\\qquad\\text{ and }\\qquad y_n=x_{n-1}\\quad\\text{ for }\\quad n\\geq 1.</math>\nIt is not difficult to check that this map is continuous, has its image in the unit sphere of \u2113<sup>\u20092</sup>, but does not have a fixed point.\n\nThe generalizations of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to infinite dimensional spaces therefore all include a compactness assumption of some sort, and in addition also often an assumption of [[Convex set|convexity]]. See [[fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces]] for a discussion of these theorems.\n\nThere is also finite-dimensional generalization to a larger class of spaces: If <math>X</math> is a product of finitely many chainable continua, then every continuous function <math>f:X\\rightarrow X</math> has a fixed point,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Eldon Dyer |year=1956|title=A fixed point theorem | journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society| volume=7 | pages=662\u2013672|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1956-0078693-4|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1956-007-04/S0002-9939-1956-0078693-4/home.html|issue=4}}</ref> where a chainable continuum is a (usually but in this case not necessarily [[Metric space|metric]]) [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] of which every [[open cover]] has a finite open refinement <math>\\{U_1,\\ldots,U_m\\}</math>, such that <math>U_i \\cap U_j \\neq \\emptyset</math> if and only if <math>|i-j| \\leq 1</math>.

W. 2010\"/> The sum is over all states accessible to the system of interest. The right hand side denominator of the equation above is also known as the [[canonical partition function]], commonly denoted by Q (or by some authors by Z).\n\n<math>\nQ={\\sum_{i=1}^{M}{e^{- {\\varepsilon}_i / k T}}}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the Boltzmann distribution can also be written as\n\n<math>\np_i={\\frac{1}{Q}} {e^{- {\\varepsilon}_i / k T}}\n</math>\n\nThis is the distribution that maximizes the [[entropy]]\n\n<math>H(p_1,p_2,\\cdots,p_M) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{M} p_i\\log_2 p_i</math>\n\nsubject the constraint that \n<math>\n{\\sum_{i=1}^{M}{p_i {\\varepsilon}_i}}\n</math>\nequals a particular mean energy value (which can be proven using [[Lagrange multipliers]]).\n\nThe partition function can be calculated if we know the energies of the levels accessible to the system of interest. For atoms the partition function values can be found in the NIST Atomic Spectra Database.<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/levels_form.html NIST Atomic Spectra Database Levels Form] at nist.gov</ref>\n\nThe distribution shows that states with lower energy will always have a higher probability of being occupied than the states with higher energy. It can also give us the quantitative relationship between the probabilities of the two states being occupied. The ratio of probabilities for states ''i'' and ''j'' is given as\n\n<math>\n{\\frac{p_i}{p_j}}=e^{({\\varepsilon}_j-{\\varepsilon}_i) / k T}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is the probability of state ''i'',  ''p<sub>j</sub>'' the probability of state ''j'', and ''\u03b5<sub>i</sub>'' and ''\u03b5<sub>j</sub>'' are the energies of states ''i'' and ''j'', respectively.\n\nThe Boltzmann distribution is often used to describe the distribution of particles, such as atoms or molecules, over energy states accessible to them. If we have a system consisting of many particles, the probability of a particle being in state ''i'' is practically the probability that, if we pick a random particle from that system and check what state it is in, we will find it is in state ''i''. This probability is equal to the number of particles in state ''i'' divided by the total number of particles in the system, that is the fraction of particles that occupy state ''i''.\n\n<math>\np_i={\\frac{N_i}{N}}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''N<sub>i</sub>'' is the number of particles in state ''i'' and ''N'' is the total number of particles in the system. We may use the Boltzmann distribution to find this probability that is, as we have seen, equal to the fraction of particles that are in state i. So the equation that gives the fraction of particles in state ''i'' as a function of the energy of that state is  <ref name=\"Atkins, P. W. 2010\"/>\n\n<math>\n{\\frac{N_i}{N}}={\\frac{e^{- {\\varepsilon}_i / k T}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{M}{e^{- {\\varepsilon}_j / k T}}}}\n</math>\n\nThis equation is of great importance to [[spectroscopy]]. In spectroscopy we observe a [[spectral line]] of atoms or molecules that we are interested in going from one state to another.<ref name=\"Atkins, P. W. 2010\"/><ref>Atkins, P. W.; de Paula J. (2009) Physical Chemistry, 9th edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK</ref> In order for this to be possible, there must be some particles in the first state to undergo the transition. We may find that this condition is fulfilled by finding the fraction of particles in the first state. If it is negligible, the transition is very likely not to be observed at the temperature for which the calculation was done. In general, a larger fraction of molecules in the first state means a higher number of transitions to the second state.<ref>Skoog, D. A.; Holler, F. J.; Crouch, S. R. (2006) Principles of Instrumental Analysis, Brooks/Cole, Boston, MA</ref> This gives a stronger spectral line. However, there are other factors that influence the intensity of a spectral line, such as whether it is caused by an allowed or a [[forbidden transition]].\n\n== In statistical mechanics ==\n{{main|Canonical ensemble|Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics}}\n\nThe Boltzmann distribution appears in [[statistical mechanics]] when considering isolated (or nearly-isolated) systems of fixed composition that are in [[thermal equilibrium]] (equilibrium with respect to energy exchange). The most general case is the probability distribution for the canonical ensemble, but also some special cases (derivable from the canonical ensemble) also show the Boltzmann distribution in different aspects:\n\n; [[Canonical ensemble]] (general case)\n: The [[canonical ensemble]] gives the [[probabilities]] of the various possible states of a closed system of fixed volume, in thermal equilibrium with a [[heat bath]]. The canonical ensemble is a probability distribution with the Boltzmann form.\n; Statistical frequencies of subsystems' states (in a non-interacting collection)\n: When the system of interest is a collection of many non-interacting copies of a smaller subsystem, it is sometimes useful to find the [[statistical frequency]] of a given subsystem state, among the collection. The canonical ensemble has the property of separability when applied to such a collection: as long as the non-interacting subsystems have fixed composition, then each subsystem's state is independent of the others and is also characterized by a canonical ensemble. As a result, the [[expectation value|expected]] statistical frequency distribution of subsystem states has the Boltzmann form.\n; [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics]] of classical gases (systems of non-interacting particles)\n: In particle systems, many particles share the same space and regularly change places with each other; the single-particle state space they occupy is a shared space. [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics]] give the expected number of particles found in a given single-particle state, in a [[classical mechanics|classical]] gas of non-interacting particles at equilibrium. This expected number distribution has the Boltzmann form.\n\nAlthough these cases have strong similarities, it is helpful to distinguish them as they generalize in different ways when the crucial assumptions are changed:\n* When a system is in thermodynamic equilibrium with respect to both energy exchange ''and particle exchange'', the requirement of fixed composition is relaxed and a [[grand canonical ensemble]] is obtained rather than canonical ensemble. On the other hand, if both composition and energy are fixed, then a [[microcanonical ensemble]] applies instead.\n* If the subsystems within a collection ''do'' interact with each other, then the expected frequencies of subsystem states no longer follow a Boltzmann distribution, and even may not have an [[analytical solution]].<ref>A classic example of this is [[magnetic ordering]]. Systems of non-interacting [[spin (physics)|spins]] show [[paramagnetic]] behaviour that can be understood with a single-particle canonical ensemble (resulting in the [[Brillouin function]]). Systems of ''interacting'' spins can show much more complex behaviour such as [[ferromagnetism]] or [[antiferromagnetism]].</ref> The canonical ensemble can however still be applied to the ''collective'' states of the entire system considered as a whole, provided the entire system is isolated and in thermal equilibrium.\n* With ''[[quantum mechanics|quantum]]'' gases of non-interacting particles in equilibrium, the number of particles found in a given single-particle state does not follow Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics, and there is no simple closed form expression for quantum gases in the canonical ensemble. In the grand canonical ensemble the state-filling statistics of quantum gases are described by [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] or [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]], depending on whether the particles are [[fermion]]s or [[boson]]s respectively.\n\n== In mathematics ==\n\n{{main|Gibbs measure|Log-linear model|Boltzmann machine}}\n\nIn more general mathematical settings, the Boltzmann distribution is also known as the [[Gibbs measure]].

This may or may not be accompanied by a concentration of [[fielding positions in cricket|fielders]] on the [[leg side]]. The line of attack aims to cramp the [[batsman]], making him play the [[cricket ball|ball]] with the [[cricket bat|bat]] close to the body. This makes it difficult to hit the ball freely and score runs, especially on the [[Fielding (cricket)#Off and leg side fields|off side]]. Since a leg theory attack means the batsman is more likely to hit the ball on the leg side, additional fielders on that side of the field can be effective in preventing runs and taking catches.\n\nStifling the batsman in this manner can lead to impatience and frustration, resulting in rash play by the batsman which in turn can lead to a quick dismissal.\n\nLeg theory can be a moderately successful tactic when used with both [[fast bowling]] and [[spin bowling]], particularly [[leg spin]] to right-handed batsmen or [[off spin]] to left-handed batsmen. However, because it relies on lack of concentration or discipline by the batsman, it can be risky against patient and skilled players, especially batsmen who are strong on the leg side. The English opening bowlers [[Sydney Barnes]] and [[Frank Foster (cricketer)|Frank Foster]] used leg theory with some success in Australia in 1911-12. In England, at around the same time [[Fred Root]] was one of the main proponents of the same tactic.\n\nConcentrating attack on the leg stump is considered by many cricket fans and commentators to lead to boring play, as it stifles run scoring and encourages batsmen to play conservatively.\n\n==Fast leg theory==\n{{Main|Bodyline}}\n\nIn 1930, [[England cricket team|England]] captain [[Douglas Jardine]], together with [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]'s captain [[Arthur Carr (cricketer)|Arthur Carr]] and his bowlers [[Harold Larwood]] and [[Bill Voce]], developed a variant of leg theory in which the bowlers bowled fast, short-pitched balls that would rise into the batsman's body, together with a heavily stacked ring of close fielders on the leg side. The idea was that when the batsman defended against the ball, he would be likely to deflect the ball into the air for a catch.\n\nJardine called this modified form of the tactic ''fast leg theory''. On the 1932-33 English tour of [[Australia]], Larwood and Voce bowled fast leg theory at the Australian batsmen. It turned out to be extremely dangerous, and most Australian players sustained injuries from being hit by the ball. [[Wicket-keeper]] [[Bert Oldfield]]'s skull was fractured by a ball hitting his head (although the ball had first glanced off the bat and Larwood had an orthodox field), almost precipitating a riot by the Australian crowd.\n\nThe Australian press dubbed the tactic ''[[Bodyline]]'', and claimed it was a deliberate attempt by the English team to intimidate and injure the Australian players. Reports of the controversy reaching England at the time described the bowling as ''fast leg theory'', which sounded to many people to be a harmless and well-established tactic. This led to a serious misunderstanding amongst the English public and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] - the administrators of English cricket - of the dangers posed by Bodyline. The English press and cricket authorities declared the Australian protests to be a case of sore losing and \"squealing\".\n\nIt was only with the return of the English team and the subsequent use of Bodyline against English players in England by the touring [[West Indies cricket team|West Indian cricket team]] in 1933 that demonstrated to the country the dangers it posed. The MCC subsequently revised the [[Laws of Cricket]] to prevent the use of \"fast leg theory\" tactics in future, also limiting the traditional tactic.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bodyline]]\n* [[Off theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Leg Theory}}\n[[Category:Cricket captaincy and tactics]]\n[[Category:Bowling (cricket)]]", "sha1": "c8nndk8gg6yj9mkafjywka1wv7agn41"}}, {"title": "Blythe Danner", "ns": "0", "id": "4110", "revision": {"id": "866100841", "parentid": "864639803", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T07:39:03Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2600:1702:AB0:D890:3021:A22E:FE1B:5376"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2015}}\n{{Infobox person\n| image        = Blythe Danner - 1980.jpg\n| caption      = Danner in 1980\n| birth_name   = Blythe Katherine Danner\n| birth_date   =  {{Birth date and age|1943|2|3}}\n| birth_place  = [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], U.S.\n| alma_mater   = [[Bard College]]\n| occupation   = Actress\n| years_active = 1968\u2013present\n| spouse       = {{marriage|[[Bruce Paltrow]]<br>|1969|2002|end=died}}\n| children     = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]\n* [[Jake Paltrow]]\n}}\n| relatives = [[Harry Danner]] <small>(brother)</small>\n}}\n\n'''Blythe Katherine Danner Paltrow''' (born February 3, 1943) is an American actress.

As a general principle, Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions are used to oxidize the ore. This step is entirely independent of microbes. The role of the bacteria is the further oxidation of the ore, but also the regeneration of the chemical oxidant Fe<sup>3+</sup> from Fe<sup>2+</sup>. For example, bacteria [[catalyst|catalyse]] the breakdown of the mineral [[pyrite]] (FeS<sub>2</sub>) by oxidising the [[sulfur]] and metal (in this case ferrous iron, (Fe<sup>2+</sup>)) using [[oxygen]]. This yields [[Solubility|soluble]] [[product (chemistry)|products]] that can be further purified and refined to yield the desired metal.\n\n'''[[Pyrite]] leaching''' (FeS<sub>2</sub>):\nIn the first step, disulfide is spontaneously oxidized to [[thiosulfate]] by ferric ion (Fe<sup>3+</sup>), which in turn is reduced to give ferrous ion (Fe<sup>2+</sup>):\n:(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <math>\\mathrm{FeS_2 + 6 \\ Fe^{\\,3+} + 3 \\ H_2O \\longrightarrow 7 \\ Fe^{\\,2+} + S_2O_3^{\\,2-} + 6 \\ H^+}</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spontaneous\n\nThe ferrous ion is then oxidized by bacteria using oxygen:\n:(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; <math>\\mathrm{4 \\ Fe^{\\,2+} + \\ O_2 + 4 \\ H^+ \\longrightarrow 4 \\ Fe^{\\,3+} + 2 \\ H_2O}</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iron oxidizers)\n\nThiosulfate is also oxidized by bacteria to give sulfate:\n:(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; <math>\\mathrm{S_2O_3^{\\,2-} + 2 \\ O_2 + H_2O \\longrightarrow 2 \\ SO_4^{\\,2-} + 2 \\ H^+}</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(sulfur oxidizers)\n\nThe ferric ion produced in reaction (2) oxidized more sulfide as in reaction (1), closing the cycle and given the net reaction:\n:(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\mathrm{2 \\ FeS_2 + 7 \\ O_2 + 2 \\ H_2O \\longrightarrow 2 \\ Fe^{\\,2+} + 4 \\ SO_4^{\\,2-} + 4 \\ H^+}</math>\n\nThe net products of the reaction are soluble [[ferrous sulfate]] and [[sulfuric acid]].\n\nThe microbial oxidation process occurs at the [[cell membrane]] of the bacteria. The [[electron]]s pass into the [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and are used in [[biochemical]] processes to produce energy for the bacteria while reducing oxygen to [[water]]. The critical reaction is the oxidation of sulfide by ferric iron. The main role of the bacterial step is the regeneration of this reactant.\n\nThe process for copper is very similar, but the efficiency and kinetics depend on the copper mineralogy. The most efficient minerals are supergene minerals such as [[chalcocite]], Cu<sub>2</sub>S and [[covellite]], CuS. The main copper mineral [[chalcopyrite]] (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>) is not leached very efficiently, which is why the dominant copper-producing technology remains flotation, followed by smelting and refining. The leaching of CuFeS<sub>2</sub> follows the two stages of being dissolved and then further oxidised, with Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions being left in solution.\n\n'''[[Chalcopyrite]] leaching''':\n:(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <math>\\mathrm{CuFeS_2 + 4 \\ Fe^{\\,3+} \\longrightarrow Cu^{\\,2+} + 5 \\ Fe^{\\,2+} + 2 \\ S_0}</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spontaneous\n:(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; <math>\\mathrm{4 \\ Fe^{\\,2+} + O_2 + 4 \\ H^+ \\longrightarrow 4 \\ Fe^{\\,3+} + 2 \\ H_2O}</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iron oxidizers)\n:(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; <math>\\mathrm{2 \\ S^0 + 3 \\ O_2 + 2 \\ H_2O \\longrightarrow 2 \\ SO_4^{\\,2-} + 4 \\ H^+}</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(sulfur oxidizers)\nnet reaction:\n:(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\mathrm{CuFeS_2 + 4 \\ O_2 \\longrightarrow Cu^{\\,2+} + Fe^{\\,2+} + 2 \\ SO_4^{\\,2-}}</math>\n\nIn general, [[sulfide]]s are first oxidized to elemental sulfur, whereas [[disulfide]]s are oxidized to give [[thiosulfate]], and the processes above can be applied to other sulfidic ores. Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores such as [[pitchblende]] also uses ferric iron as an oxidant (e.g., UO<sub>2</sub> + 2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> ==> UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> + 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup>). In this case, the sole purpose of the bacterial step is the regeneration of Fe<sup>3+</sup>. Sulfidic [[iron ore]]s can be added to speed up the process and provide a source of iron.  Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores by layering of waste sulfides and elemental sulfur, colonized by ''Acidithiobacillus'' spp., has been accomplished, which provides a strategy for accelerated leaching of materials that do not contain sulfide minerals.<ref>Power, I.M., Dipple, G.M., and Southam, G. (2010) ''Bioleaching of ultramafic tailings by Acidithiobacillus spp. for CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration'', http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es900986n Environmental Science & Technology. 44: 456-462.</ref>\n\n== Further processing ==\nThe dissolved copper (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) ions are removed from the solution by [[ligand]] exchange solvent extraction, which leaves other ions in the solution. The copper is removed by bonding to a ligand, which is a large molecule consisting of a number of smaller [[functional group|groups]], each possessing a [[lone electron pair]]. The ligand-copper complex is extracted from the solution using an [[organic compound|organic]] solvent such as [[kerosene]]:\n\n:Cu<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2LH(organic) &rarr; CuL<sub>2</sub>(organic) + 2H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nThe ligand donates electrons to the copper, producing a [[complex (chemistry)|complex]] - a central metal [[atom]] (copper) bonded to the ligand. Because this complex has no [[electric charge|charge]], it is no longer attracted to [[polar molecule|polar]] water molecules and dissolves in the kerosene, which is then easily separated from the solution. Because the initial [[chemical reaction|reaction]] is [[reversible reaction|reversible]], it is determined by pH. Adding concentrated acid reverses the equation, and the copper ions go back into an aqueous solution.\n\nThen the copper is passed through an electro-winning process to increase its purity: An [[electric current]] is passed through the resulting solution of copper ions. Because copper ions have a 2+ charge, they are attracted to the negative [[cathode]]s and collect there.\n\nThe copper can also be concentrated and separated by [[single displacement reaction|displacing]] the copper with Fe from scrap iron:\n\n:Cu<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + Fe<sub>(s)</sub> &rarr; Cu<sub>(s)</sub> + Fe<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nThe electrons lost by the iron are taken up by the copper. Copper is the oxidising agent (it accepts electrons), and iron is the reducing agent (it loses electrons).\n\nTraces of precious metals such as gold may be left in the original solution. Treating the mixture with [[sodium cyanide]] in the presence of free oxygen dissolves the gold. The gold is removed from the solution by [[adsorption|adsorbing]] (taking it up on the surface) to [[charcoal]].\n\n==With fungi==\nSeveral species of [[Fungus|fungi]] can be used for bioleaching. Fungi can be grown on many different substrates, such as [[e-waste|electronic scrap]], [[catalytic converter]]s, and [[fly ash]] from municipal waste [[incineration]]. Experiments have shown that two fungal [[strain (biology)|strains]] (''Aspergillus niger, Penicillium simplicissimum'') were able to mobilize Cu and Sn by 65%, and Al, Ni, Pb, and Zn by more than 95%. ''Aspergillus niger'' can produce some organic acids such as [[citric acid]].  This form of leaching does not rely on microbial oxidation of metal but rather uses microbial metabolism as source of acids that directly dissolve the metal.\n\n==Compared with other extraction techniques==\nExtractions involve many expensive steps such as [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]], pressure oxidation, and [[smelting]], which require sufficient concentrations of [[chemical element|elements]] in ores and are environmentally unfriendly. Low concentrations are not a problem for bacteria because they simply ignore the waste that surrounds the metals, attaining extraction yields of over 90% in some cases. These [[microorganism]]s actually gain [[energy]] by breaking down minerals into their constituent elements. The company simply collects the [[ion]]s out of the [[solution]] after the bacteria have finished. There is a limited amount of ores.\n\n===Advantages===\n*[[Economics|Economical]]: Bioleaching is in general simpler and, therefore, cheaper to operate and maintain than traditional processes, since fewer specialists are needed to operate complex [[chemical]] [[factory|plants]].\n*[[pollution|Environmental]]: The process is more environmentally friendly than traditional extraction methods.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}  For the company this can translate into profit, since the necessary limiting of [[sulfur dioxide]] [[air pollution|emissions]] during smelting is expensive. Less landscape damage occurs, since the bacteria involved grow naturally, and the mine and surrounding area can be left relatively untouched. As the bacteria [[biological reproduction|breed]] in the conditions of the mine, they are easily cultivated and [[recycling|recycled]].\n*Ore concentration: Bioleaching can be used to extract metals from ores that are too poor for other technologies. It can be used to partially replace the extensive crushing and grinding that translates to prohibitive cost and energy consumption in a conventional process.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n*Economical: The bacterial leaching process is very slow compared to smelting. This brings in less profit as well as introducing a significant delay in [[cash flow]] for new plants.\n*Environmental: [[Toxicity|Toxic]] chemicals are sometimes produced in the process. [[Sulfuric acid]] and H<sup>+</sup> ions that have been formed can leak into the [[groundwater|ground]] and surface water turning it acidic, causing environmental damage. [[Heavy ion]]s such as [[iron]], zinc, and arsenic leak during [[acid mine drainage]]. When the [[pH]] of this solution rises, as a result of [[concentration|dilution]] by fresh water, these ions [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]], forming [[Acid mine drainage#Yellow boy|\"Yellow Boy\"]] pollution. For these reasons, a setup of bioleaching must be carefully planned, since the process can lead to a [[biosafety]] failure. Unlike other methods, once started, bioheap leaching cannot be quickly stopped, because leaching would still continue with rainwater and natural bacteria.\n\nAt the current time, it is more economical to smelt copper ore rather than to use bioleaching, since the concentration of copper in its ore is in general quite high. The profit obtained from the speed and yield of smelting justifies its cost. Nonetheless, at the largest copper mine of the world, [[Escondida]] in [[Chile]] the process seems to be favorable.\n\nHowever, the concentration of gold in its ore is in general very low. In this case, the lower cost of bacterial leaching outweighs the time it takes to extract the metal.\nEconomically it is also very expensive and many companies once started can not keep up with the demand and end up in debt. Projects like Finnish [[Talvivaara]] proved to be environmentally and economically disastrous.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biotechnology}}\n* [[BHP Billiton]]\n* [[Talvivaara]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''T.

While it can be done without any equipment, most climbers use [[climbing shoe]]s to help secure footholds, [[Magnesium carbonate|chalk]] to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and [[bouldering mat]]s to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike [[free solo climbing]], which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the sequence of moves that a climber performs to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20 ft.) tall. Traverses, which are a form of boulder problem, require the climber to climb horizontally from one end to another. <ref name=\"Access2006\"/>{{rp|3}} [[Indoor climbing|Artificial climbing walls]] allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders.

Additionally, the sport served to build stamina and increase finger strength.  Throughout the 1900s, bouldering evolved into a separate discipline.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Pete|title=The Complete Guide to Climbing and Mountaineering|year=2008|publisher=David&Charles|location=Cincinnati, OH 45236|isbn=978-0-7153-2842-2|page=94}}</ref> Individual problems are assigned ratings based on difficulty. Although there have been various [[Grade (bouldering)|rating systems]] used throughout the history of bouldering, modern problems usually use either the V-scale or the [[Fontainebleau rock climbing|Fontainebleau]] scale.\n\nThe growing popularity of bouldering has caused several environmental concerns, including soil [[erosion]] and trampled vegetation as climbers hike off-trail to reach bouldering sites. This has caused some landowners to restrict access or prohibit bouldering altogether.\n\n== Outdoor bouldering ==\nThe characteristics of boulder problems depend largely on the type of rock being climbed. For example, [[Granite]] often features long [[Crack climbing|cracks]] and [[slab climbing|slab]]s while [[Sandstone]] rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks. [[Limestone]] and [[volcanic rock]] are also used for bouldering.<ref name=\"Lourens2005\"/>{{rp|21\u201322}}\n\nThere are many prominent bouldering areas throughout the United States, including [[Hueco Tanks]] in Texas, [[Mount Evans]] in Colorado, and [[The Buttermilks]] in [[Bishop, California]].

Using the same protection as standard bouldering climbers venture up house sized rocks that test not only their physical skill and strength but mental focus. Highballing, like most of climbing, is open to interpretation. Most climbers say anything above 15 feet is a highball and can range in height up to 35\u201340 feet where highball bouldering then turns into [[free soloing]]. \n\nHighball bouldering began in 1961 when John Gill climbed a 37 foot boulder he called \"''The Thimble''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105714549/the-thimble|title=Rock Climbing in The Thimble, Custer State Park|website=Mountain Project|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>  Gill's achievement initiated a wave of climbers making ascents of large boulders. Later with the introduction of larger crash pads climbers were able push the limits of highball bouldering higher and higher. In 2002 Jason Kehl completed the first hard highball called Evilution, a 55 foot boulder in the Buttermilks of California earning the grade of V12. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105908296/evilution|title=Climb Evilution, Sierra Eastside|website=Mountain Project|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> This climb marked the beginning of a new generation of highball climbing that pushed not only height, but difficulty. \n\nGroundbreaking ascents in this style include; ''Ambrosia'', a 55 foot boulder in Bishop, California climbed by Kevin Jorgeson in 2015 sporting the grade of V11.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainproject.com/route/110088205/ambrosia|title=Climb Ambrosia, Sierra Eastside|website=Mountain Project|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>  \n\n''Too Big to Flail,'' V10, another 55 foot line in Bishop, California climbed by Alex Honnold in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainproject.com/route/111711154/too-big-to-flail|title=Climb Too Big To Flail, Sierra Eastside|website=Mountain Project|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n\n''Livin' Large'', a 35 foot V15 in Rocklands, South Africa found and established by Nalle Hukkataival in 2009 has become the \"test piece\" of hard high ball climbing in the 21st century and has only been repeated by only one person, Jimmy Webb.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hardclimbs.info/climbs/livin-large|title=HardClimbs.info {{!}} Ascents for Livin' Large|website=www.hardclimbs.info|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> \n\n''The Process'', a 55 foot V16 in Bishop, California first climbed by Daniel Woods in 2015.

In the US the most common method Routesetters use to designate the intended problem is by placing colored tape next to each hold.

For example, green may be v0-v1, blue may be v2-v3 and so on. Using colored holds to set has certain advantages, the most notable of which are that it makes it more obvious where the holds for a problem are, and that there is no chance of tape being accidentally kicked off footholds. Smaller, resource-poor climbing gyms may prefer taped problems because large, expensive holds can be used in multiple routes by marking them with more than one color of tape.\n\n=== Competitions ===\nThe [[International Federation of Sport Climbing]] (IFSC) employs an indoor format\u2013 although competitions can also take place in an outdoor setting<ref name=\"Lourens2005\">{{cite book |title=Guide to Climbing |author=Lourens, Tony |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=2005 |isbn=9780811701525 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mdQcBNKK1iIC}}</ref>{{rp|18}}\u2013 that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals.

Early records describe climbers engaging in what is now referred to as bouldering, not as a separate discipline, but as a playful form of training for larger ascents <ref>The Origins of Bouldering. http://www.johngill.net</ref>. In the early 20th century, the [[Fontainebleau]] area of [[France]] established itself as a prominent climbing area, where some of the first dedicated ''bleausards'' (or \"boulderers\") emerged. One of those athletes, [[Pierre Allain]], invented the specialized shoe used for rock climbing.<ref name=\"Beal2011\"/>{{rp|ch.&nbsp;1}}\n\nIn the 1960s, American mathematician [[John Gill (climber)|John Gill]] pushed the sport further and contributed several important innovations. Gill previously pursued [[gymnastics]], a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for movements and body positions, and shifted the focus of bouldering from reaching the summit to navigating a set of holds.<ref name=\"Beal2011\"/>{{rp|ch.&nbsp;1}} Gill developed a rating system that was closed-ended: B1 problems were as difficult as the most challenging roped routes of the time, B2 problems were more difficult, and B3 problems had been completed once.<ref name=\"Sherman2001\"/>{{rp|64\u201365}}\n\nGill introduced [[magnesium carbonate|chalk]] as a method of keeping the climber's hands dry, promoted a dynamic climbing style, and emphasized the importance of [[strength training]] to complement skill.<ref>For more on Gill's bouldering philosophy, see [http://www.stonecountry.co.uk/page11.html ''The Boulder: A Philosophy for Bouldering'' (Stone Country Press] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816065033/http://www.stonecountry.co.uk/page11.html |date=16 August 2013 }}, by Francis Sanzaro (Stone Country press, 2013).</ref> These practices had not been popular among climbers, but as Gill improved in ability and influence, his ideas became the norm.<ref name=\"Beal2011\"/>{{rp|ch.&nbsp;1}}\n\nIn the 1980s, two important training tools emerged. One important training tool was [[bouldering mat]]s, also referred to as \"crash pads\", which protected against injuries from falling and enabled boulderers to climb in areas that would have been too dangerous otherwise. The second important tool was indoor climbing walls, which helped spread the sport to areas without outdoor climbing and allowed serious climbers to train year-round.<ref name=\"Beal2011\"/>{{rp|ch.&nbsp;1}}\n\nAs the sport grew in popularity, new bouldering areas were developed throughout Europe and the United States, and more athletes began participating in bouldering competitions. The visibility of the sport greatly increased in the early 2000s, as [[YouTube]] videos and climbing [[blog]]s helped boulderers around the world to quickly learn techniques, find hard problems, and announce newly completed projects.<ref name=\"Beal2011\"/>{{rp|ch.&nbsp;1}}\n\n[[File:Christian Core on Gioia.jpg|thumb|[[Christian Core]] on ''Gioia'' ([[Varazze]], [[Italy|ITA]]), first {{climbing grade|8C+}} boulder in history, 2008]]\n[[File:Midnight Lightning yosemite.jpg|thumb|Michael Rael Armas on ''Midnight Lightning'', [[Camp 4 (Yosemite)|Camp 4]] ([[Yosemite National Park]], [[United States|USA]]), one of the world's most famous bouldering problems]]\n=== Notable ascents ===\n{{Main|Notable first free ascents}}\n{{Boulder grade|9A}} (unconfirmed):\n:*''Burden of Dreams'' \u2013 Lappnor ([[Finland|{{ISO 3166 code-3|Finland}}]]) \u2013 October 2016 \u2013 Grade proposed by [[Nalle Hukkataival]] after several years of trials.

Besides protecting the climber's feet from rough surfaces, climbing shoes are designed to help the climber secure footholds. Climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork. They are manufactured in a variety of different styles to perform in different situations.

Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquid's edge, not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as [[vapor]]. On the other hand, [[boiling]] is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.\n\n==Saturation temperature and pressure==\n[[File:11. \u0422\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0432\u0440\u0438\u0435\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442.ogv|thumb|right|280px|Demonstration of the lower boiling point of water at lower pressure, achieved by using a [[vacuum pump]].]]\n{{Main|Vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium}}\nA ''saturated liquid'' contains as much thermal energy as it can without boiling (or conversely a ''saturated vapor'' contains as little thermal energy as it can without [[Condensation|condensing]]).\n\n'''Saturation temperature''' means ''boiling point''. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its [[Gas|vapor phase]]. The liquid can be said to be saturated with [[thermal energy]]. Any addition of thermal energy results in a [[phase transition]].\n\nIf the pressure in a system remains constant ([[Isobaric process|isobaric]]), a vapor at saturation temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as thermal energy ([[heat]]) is removed. Similarly, a liquid at saturation temperature and pressure will boil into its vapor phase as additional thermal energy is applied.\n\nThe boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding environmental pressure. Thus, the boiling point is dependent on the pressure. Boiling points may be published with respect to the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST, USA]] [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard pressure]] of 101.325 [[kilopascal|kPa]] (or 1 [[atmospheric pressure|atm]]), or the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] standard pressure of 100.000 kPa. At higher elevations, where the atmospheric pressure is much lower, the boiling point is also lower. The boiling point increases with increased pressure up to the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], where the gas and liquid properties become identical. The boiling point cannot be increased beyond the critical point. Likewise, the boiling point decreases with decreasing pressure until the [[triple point]] is reached. The boiling point cannot be reduced below the triple point.\n\nIf the heat of vaporization and the vapor pressure of a liquid at a certain temperature are known, the boiling point can be calculated by using the [[Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation]], thus:\n\n:<math>T_\\text{B} = \\Bigg(\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{R\\,\\ln \\frac{P}{P_0}}{\\Delta H_\\text{vap}}\\Bigg)^{-1},</math>\n\nwhere:\n:<math>T_B</math> is the boiling point at the pressure of interest,\n:<math>R</math> is the [[ideal gas constant]],\n:<math>P</math> is the [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] of the liquid at the pressure of interest,\n:<math>P_0</math> is some pressure where the corresponding <math>T_0</math> is known (usually data available at 1&nbsp;atm or 100&nbsp;kPa),\n:<math>\\Delta H_\\text{vap}</math> is the [[heat of vaporization]] of the liquid,\n:<math>T_0</math> is the boiling temperature,\n:<math>\\ln</math> is the [[natural logarithm]].\n\n'''Saturation pressure''' is the pressure for a corresponding saturation temperature at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. Saturation pressure and saturation temperature have a direct relationship: as saturation pressure is increased, so is saturation temperature.\n\nIf the temperature in a [[system]] remains constant (an ''[[isothermal]]'' system), vapor at saturation pressure and temperature will begin to [[condensation|condense]] into its liquid phase as the system pressure is increased. Similarly, a liquid at saturation pressure and temperature will tend to [[Flash evaporation|flash]] into its vapor phase as system pressure is decreased.\n\nThere are two conventions regarding the ''standard boiling point of water'': The ''normal boiling point'' is {{convert|99.97|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1|lk=on}} at a pressure of 1 atm (i.e., 101.325 kPa).

A given pure compound has only one normal boiling point, if any, and a compound's normal boiling point and [[melting point]] can serve as characteristic [[Physical property|physical properties]] for that compound, listed in reference books.  The higher a compound's normal boiling point, the less volatile that compound is overall, and conversely, the lower a compound's normal boiling point, the more volatile that compound is overall.  Some compounds decompose at higher temperatures before reaching their normal boiling point, or sometimes even their melting point.  For a stable compound, the boiling point ranges from its [[triple point]] to its [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], depending on the external pressure.  Beyond its triple point, a compound's normal boiling point, if any, is higher than its melting point.  Beyond the critical point, a compound's liquid and vapor phases merge into one phase, which may be called a superheated gas.  At any given temperature, if a compound's normal boiling point is lower, then that compound will generally exist as a gas at atmospheric external pressure.  If the compound's normal boiling point is higher, then that compound can exist as a liquid or solid at that given temperature at atmospheric external pressure, and will so exist in equilibrium with its vapor (if volatile) if its vapors are contained.   If a compound's vapors are not contained, then some volatile compounds can eventually evaporate away in spite of their higher boiling points.\n\n[[File:Boiling point vs molar mass graph.png|thumb|350px|Boiling points of [[alkane]]s, [[alkene]]s, [[ether]]s, [[halogenoalkane]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[alcohol]]s and [[carboxylic acid]]s as a function of molar mass]]\nIn general, compounds with [[ionic bond]]s have high normal boiling points, if they do not decompose before reaching such high temperatures.  Many [[metal]]s have high boiling points, but not all.  Very generally\u2014with other factors being equal\u2014in compounds with covalently bonded [[molecule]]s, as the size of the molecule (or [[molecular mass]]) increases, the normal boiling point increases.  When the molecular size becomes that of a [[macromolecule]], [[polymer]], or otherwise very large, the compound often decomposes at high temperature before the boiling point is reached.  Another factor that affects the normal boiling point of a compound is the [[Polarity (chemistry)|polarity]] of its molecules.  As the polarity of a compound's molecules increases, its normal boiling point increases, other factors being equal.  Closely related is the ability of a molecule to form [[hydrogen bond]]s (in the liquid state), which makes it harder for molecules to leave the liquid state and thus increases the normal boiling point of the compound.  Simple [[carboxylic acid]]s dimerize by forming hydrogen bonds between molecules.  A minor factor affecting boiling points is the shape of a molecule.  Making the shape of a molecule more compact tends to lower the normal boiling point slightly compared to an equivalent molecule with more surface area.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Comparison of butane isomer boiling points\n|- \n!

By comparison to boiling, a [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] is a physical transformation in which a solid turns directly into vapor, which happens in a few select cases such as with [[carbon dioxide]] at atmospheric pressure.  For such compounds, a [[sublimation point]] is a temperature at which a solid turning directly into vapor has a vapor pressure equal to the external pressure.\n\n==Impurities and mixtures==\nIn the preceding section, boiling points of pure compounds were covered.  Vapor pressures and boiling points of substances can be affected by the presence of dissolved impurities ([[Solution|solutes]]) or other miscible compounds, the degree of effect depending on the concentration of the impurities or other compounds.  The presence of non-volatile impurities such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] or compounds of a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] far lower than the main component compound decreases its [[mole fraction]] and the [[Solution (chemistry)|solution's]] volatility, and thus raises the normal boiling point in proportion to the [[concentration]] of the solutes.  This effect is called '''[[boiling point elevation]]'''.  As a common example, [[Saline water|salt water]] boils at a higher temperature than pure water.\n\nIn other mixtures of miscible compounds (components), there may be two or more components of varying volatility, each having its own pure component boiling point at any given pressure.  The presence of other volatile components in a mixture affects the vapor pressures and thus boiling points and [[dew point]]s of all the components in the mixture. The dew point is a temperature at which a vapor [[Condensation|condenses]] into a liquid.

At about 10<sup>\u22126</sup> seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form [[baryon]]s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton\u2013antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons\u2013antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10<sup>10</sup> of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by [[photon]]s (with a minor contribution from [[neutrino]]s).\n\nA few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million) [[kelvin]] and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's [[deuterium]] and helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].<ref name=\"kolb_c4\"/> Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.<ref name=\"peacock_c9\"/>\n\nAs the universe cooled, the [[rest mass]] energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]].

The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the universe]] to slowly begin to accelerate.<ref name=\"peebles\" />\n\nDark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[Einstein's field equation]]s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] and relationship with the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.<ref name=\"peebles\" />\n\nAll of this cosmic evolution after the [[inflationary epoch]] can be rigorously described and modeled by the \u039bCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10<sup>\u221215</sup> seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].\n\n== Features of the model ==\nThe Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of [[physical law]]s and the [[cosmological principle]]. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropy|isotropic]].\n\nThese ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the [[fine structure constant]] over much of the [[age of the universe]] is of order 10<sup>\u22125</sup>.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Ivanchik |first=A.

The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, are themselves specified using a [[coordinate chart]] or \"grid\" that is laid down over all [[spacetime]]. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] on large scales, which uniquely singles out the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric]] (FLRW metric). \nThis metric contains a [[scale factor]], which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a [[coordinate system]] to be made, called [[comoving coordinates]]. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their ''coordinate'' distance ([[comoving distance]]) remains constant, the ''physical'' distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the [[scale factor]] of the universe.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=d'Inverno |first=R.\n |date=1992\n |chapter=Chapter 23\n |title=Introducing Einstein's Relativity\n |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-19-859686-8\n |ref=harv\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe.

Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a ''past horizon'' on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never \"catch up\" to very distant objects. This defines a ''future horizon'', which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|FLRW]] model that describes our universe.<ref name=\"kolb_c3\"/>\n\nOur understanding of the universe back to very early times [[Big Bang#Horizon problem|suggests]] that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space.

This can be seen by taking a [[frequency spectrum]] of an object and matching the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] pattern of [[emission line]]s or [[absorption line]]s corresponding to [[atom]]s of the [[chemical element]]s interacting with the light. These redshifts are [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniformly]] isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional [[velocity]] of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:<ref name=\"hubble\" />\n<math>v = H_0D</math>\nwhere\n* <math>v</math> is the recessional [[velocity]] of the [[galaxy]] or other distant object,\n* <math>D</math> is the [[comoving distance]] to the object, and\n* <math>H_0</math> is [[Hubble's constant]], measured to be {{val|70.4|+1.3|-1.4}} [[kilometres|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] by the [[WMAP]] probe.<ref name=\"wmap7year\" />\n\n[[Hubble's law]] has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies\u2014which is untenable given the [[Copernican principle]]\u2014or the universe is [[Metric expansion of space|uniformly expanding]] everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922<ref name=af1922 /> and Georges Lema\u00eetre in 1927,<ref name=gl1927 /> well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|Friedmann, Lema\u00eetre, Robertson, and Walker]].\n\nThe theory requires the relation <math>v = HD</math> to hold at all times, where <math>D</math> is the [[comoving distance]], ''v'' is the [[recessional velocity]], and <math>v</math>, <math>H</math>, and <math>D</math> vary as the universe expands (hence we write <math>H_0</math> to denote the present-day Hubble \"constant\"). For distances much smaller than the size of the [[observable universe]], the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity <math>v</math>. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.<ref name=\"peacock_c3\">Peacock (1999), chapter 3</ref>\n\nThat [[Metric expansion of space|space is undergoing metric expansion]] is shown by direct observational evidence of the [[Cosmological principle]] and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation.

However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the [[Sakharov conditions]] must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] are violated and that the universe depart from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].<ref name=\"sakharov\">\n{{cite journal\n |last=Sakharov |first=A.

To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large [[equation of state (cosmology)|negative pressure]], dubbed \"dark energy\".<ref name=\"peebles\" />\n\nDark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.<ref name=\"peebles\" /> Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the \"missing\" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of [[gravitational lens]]es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] as a cosmic ruler.\n\nNegative pressure is believed to be a property of [[vacuum energy]], but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.<ref name=\"wmap7year\" /> According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the [[far future]] as dark energy becomes even more dominant.\n\nThe dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein's [[cosmological constant]] but also extending to more exotic forms of [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or other modified gravity schemes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |journal=Particle Data Group 2014 Review of Particle Physics |date=December 2013 |arxiv=1401.0046|bibcode = 2014arXiv1401.0046M }}<br />{{cite web |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |work=LEVEL 5 \u2014 A Knowledgebase for Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology |date=2014-06-27 |url=https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March14/Mortonson/Mortonson_contents.html |accessdate=2017-04-19}}</ref> A [[cosmological constant problem]], sometimes called the \"most embarrassing problem in physics\", results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from [[Planck units]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rugh |first1=S.&thinsp;E. |last2=Zinkernagel |first2=H. |title=The quantum vacuum and the cosmological constant problem |pages=663\u2013705 |volume=33 |issue=4 |date=December 2002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219802000333 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(02)00033-3 |arxiv=hep-th/0012253|bibcode = 2002SHPMP..33..663R }}</ref>\n\n===Dark matter===\n{{Main|Dark matter}}\n[[File:Cosmological Composition \u2013 Pie Chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[pie chart|Chart]] shows the proportion of different components of the universe {{spaced ndash}} about 95% is [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].]]\nDuring the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal [[baryon]]ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter.

Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Speculations ==\n{{Main|Cosmogony}}\n\nWhile the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The Big Bang theory, built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a [[essential singularity|singularity]] at the origin of cosmic time; this [[infinity#Physics|infinite]] [[energy density]] is regarded as impossible in [[experimental physics|physics]].  Still, it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when the universe cooled down to the [[Planck temperature]], and this conclusion depends on various assumptions, of which some could never be experimentally verified. ''(Also see [[Planck epoch]].)''\n\nOne proposed refinement to avoid this would-be singularity is to develop a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Hawking |first=S.

Due to their Bavarian accent, citizens of Munich pronounced \"Einbeck\" as \"ein Bock\" (\"a [[billy goat]]\"), and thus the beer became known as \"bock\". To this day, as a visual pun, a goat often appears on bock labels.<ref name=Jackson />\n\nBock is historically associated with special occasions, often religious festivals such as Christmas, Easter or Lent (the latter as ''{{lang|de|Lentenbock}}'').

The beer should be clear, and colour can range from light copper to brown, with a bountiful and persistent off-white head. The aroma should be malty and toasty, possibly with hints of alcohol, but no detectable hops or fruitiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, with low to moderate carbonation and no astringency. The taste is rich and toasty, sometimes with a bit of caramel. Again, hop presence is low to undetectable, providing just enough bitterness so that the sweetness is not cloying and the aftertaste is muted.<ref name=DBB /> The following commercial products are indicative of the style: Point Bock (Stevens Point Brewery) [[Einbecker Brewery|Einbecker]] Ur-Bock Dunkel, [[Penn Brewery|Pennsylvania Brewing]] St. Nick Bock, [[Aass]] Bock, [[Great Lakes Brewing Company|Great Lakes]] Rockefeller Bock, [[Stegmaier Brewery|Stegmaier]] Brewhouse Bock.\n\n===Maibock===\nThe '''maibock''' style, also known as '''helles bock''' or '''heller bock''', is a [[helles]] lager brewed to bock strength; therefore, still as strong as traditional bock, but lighter in colour and with more hop presence. It is a fairly recent development compared to other styles of bock beers, frequently associated with springtime and the month of May. Colour can range from deep gold to light amber with a large, creamy, persistent white head, and moderate to moderately high carbonation, while alcohol content ranges from 6.3% to 7.4% by volume. The flavour is typically less malty than a traditional bock, and may be drier, hoppier, and more bitter, but still with a relatively low hop flavour, with a mild spicy or peppery quality from the hops, increased carbonation and alcohol content. The following commercial products are indicative of the style: [[Ayinger]] Maibock, Mahr's Bock, [[Hacker-Pschorr]] Hubertus Bock, Capital Maibock, Einbecker Mai-Urbock, [[Staatliches Hofbr\u00e4uhaus in M\u00fcnchen|Hofbr\u00e4u]] Maibock, [[Victory Brewing Company|Victory]] St. Boisterous, [[Gordon Biersch]] Blonde Bock, [[Smuttynose Brewing Company|Smuttynose]] Maibock, [[Old Dominion Brewing Company]] Big Thaw Bock, [Brewery 85's Quittin' Time], [[Rogue Ales|Rogue]] Dead Guy [[Ale]], [[Franconia Brewing Company]] Maibock [[Ale]], Church Street maibock, and [[Tr\u00f6egs Brewing Company|Tr\u00f6egs]] Cultivator.\n\n===Doppelbock===\n''Doppelbock'' or ''double bock'' is a stronger version of traditional bock that was first brewed in Munich by the Paulaner Friars, a Franciscan order founded by [[Francis of Paola|St. Francis of Paula]].<ref name=GBI /> Historically, doppelbock was high in alcohol and sweet, thus serving as \"liquid bread\" for the Friars during times of fasting, when solid food was not permitted. Today, doppelbock is still strong\u2014ranging from 7%\u201312% or more by volume. It isn't clear, with color ranging from dark gold, for the paler version, to dark brown with ruby highlights for darker version. It has a large, creamy, persistent head (although head retention may be impaired by alcohol in the stronger versions). The aroma is intensely malty, with some toasty notes, and possibly some alcohol presence as well; darker versions may have a chocolate-like or fruity aroma. The flavor is very rich and malty, with toasty notes and noticeable alcoholic strength, and little or no detectable hops (16\u201326 IBUs). Paler versions may have a drier finish. The monks who originally brewed doppelbock named their beer \"Salvator\" (literally \"Savior\", but actually a malapropism for \"Sankt Vater\", \"St. Father\", originally brewed for the feast of St. Francis of Paola on 2 April which often falls into Lent), which today is trademarked by [[Paulaner]].<ref name=GBI /> Brewers of modern doppelbocks often add \"[[wikt:-ator|-ator]]\" to their beer's name as a signpost of the style; there are 200 \"-ator\" doppelbock names registered with the German patent office.<ref name=GBI /> The following are representative examples of the style: Predator, [[Paulaner]] Salvator, [[Ayinger]] Celebrator, [[Weihenstephaner]] Korbinian, [[Andechser]] Doppelbock Dunkel, [[Spaten]] Optimator, [[Augustiner]] Maximator, Tucher Bajuvator, Weltenburger Kloster Asam-Bock, [[Capital Brewery|Capital]] Autumnal Fire, EKU 28, [[Eggenberg Castle, Vorchdorf|Eggenberg]] Urbock 23\u00ba, [[Bell's brewery|Bell's]] Consecrator, [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]] La Rossa, [[Samuel Adams]] Double Bock, [[Tr\u00f6egs Brewing Company|Tr\u00f6egs]] Tr\u00f6egenator Double Bock, Wasatch Brewery Devastator, [[Great Lakes Brewing Company|Great Lakes]] Doppelrock, [[Abita Brewing Company|Abita]] Andygator, Wolverine State Brewing Company Predator, and Christian Moerlein Emancipator Doppelbock.\n\n===Eisbock===\n[[File:Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock.jpg|thumb|right|Eisbock beer, made by removing ice from partially frozen barrels of beer, resulting in higher alcohol content.]]\nEisbock is a traditional specialty beer of the [[Kulmbach (district)|Kulmbach district]] of Germany that is made by [[freeze distillation|partially freezing]] a doppelbock and removing the water ice to concentrate the flavour and alcohol content, which ranges from 9% to 13% by volume.  It is clear, with a colour ranging from deep copper to dark brown in colour, often with ruby highlights. Although it can pour with a thin off-white head, head retention is frequently impaired by the higher alcohol content. The aroma is intense, with no hop presence, but frequently can contain fruity notes, especially of prunes, raisins, and plums. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with significant alcohol, although this should not be hot or sharp. The flavour is rich and sweet, often with toasty notes, and sometimes hints of chocolate, always balanced by a significant alcohol presence. The following are representative examples of the style: Kulmbacher Reichelbr\u00e4u Eisbock, [[Schloss Eggenberg|Eggenberg]], [[G. Schneider & Sohn|Schneider]] [[Aventinus (beer)|Aventinus]] Eisbock, Urbock Dunkel Eisbock, [[Franconia Brewing Company]] Ice Bock 17%.\n\nThe strongest ice-beer is produced by a Franconian company and is called Schorschbr\u00e4u and is 57% ABV, a former world record for beer ABV.\n\n===Weizenbock===\nWeizenbock is a style of bock brewed using wheat instead of barley.

Bleek's coinage was inspired by the anthropological observation of groups self-identifying as \"people\" or \"the true people\" (as is indeed the case, for example, with the ''[[Khoikhoi]]'' of South Africa).<ref>\nR.K.Herbert and R.

In Bantu itself, the term for languages is formed with the \n[[:wikt:Appendix:Swahili_noun_classes#Ki-vi_class|''ki-'' noun class]] (Nguni ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Nguni/\u00edsi-|\u00edsi-]]''), as in ''Kiswahili '' \"coast-language\" and ''isiZulu'' \"Zulu language\". \nApparently inspired by this pattern, there was a suggestion in South Africa to refer to Bantu languages as \"Kintu\" in the 1980s.\nThe suggestion was immediately abandoned. Not only does the word ''kintu'' exist,  meaning \"thing\" with no relation to the concept of \"language\",<ref>Joshua Wantate Sempebwa ,''The Ontological and Normative Structure in the Social Reality of a Bantu Society: A Systematic Study of Ganda Ontology and Ethics'', 1978, p. 71.</ref> it was also reported by  delegates at the African Languages Association of Southern Africa conference in 1984 that in some Bantu  languages, the term 'Kintu' has a derogatory significance,<ref>[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02572117.1984.10587452 Addendum:    ALASA conference of 1984 doi:10.1080/02572117.1984.10587452] <!--apparently someone presented the \"Kintu\" suggestion there and was shot down immediately.\nSeems to be a non-issue except as a funny example of people trying up to come up with more \"correct\" and \"authentic\" names end up calling people by slors (c.f.

This [[Bantu expansion]] came to dominate Sub-Saharan Africa east of Cameroon, an area where [[Bantu peoples]] now constitute nearly the entire population.<ref name=\"Adler\"/><ref name=\"Falola\">Toyin Falola, Aribidesi Adisa Usman, ''Movements, borders, and identities in Africa'', (University Rochester Press: 2009), p.4.</ref>\n\nThe technical term Bantu, meaning \"human beings\" or simply \"people\", was first used by [[Wilhelm Bleek]] (1827\u20131875), as this is reflected in many of the languages of this group. A common characteristic of Bantu languages is that they use words such as ''muntu'' or ''mutu'' for \"human being\" or in simplistic terms \"person\", and the plural prefix for human nouns starting with ''mu-'' (class 1) in most languages is ''ba-'' (class 2), thus giving ''bantu'' for \"people\". Bleek, and later [[Carl Meinhof]], pursued extensive studies comparing the grammatical structures of Bantu languages.\n\n==Classification==\n{{main|Guthrie classification of Bantu languages}}\n[[File:Bantu zones.png|thumb|upright=1.59|The approximate locations of the [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|sixteen Guthrie Bantu zones]], including the addition of a [[Great Lakes Bantu languages|zone J around the Great Lakes]]. The [[Jarawan languages]] are spoken in Nigeria.]]\n\nThe most widely used classification is an alphanumeric coding system developed by [[Malcolm Guthrie]] in his 1948 classification of the Bantu languages. is mainly geographic. The term 'narrow Bantu' was coined by the ''Benue\u2013Congo Working Group'' to distinguish Bantu as recognized by Guthrie, from the [[Bantoid languages]] not recognized as Bantu by Guthrie.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}\n\nIn recent times,{{when|date=July 2017}} the distinctiveness of Narrow Bantu as opposed to the other [[Southern Bantoid languages]] has been called into doubt (cf. Piron 1995, Williamson & Blench 2000, Blench 2011), but the term is still widely used. \nA coherent classification of Narrow Bantu will likely need to exclude many of the Zone A and perhaps Zone B languages.{{speculation inline|date=July 2017}}\n\nThere is no true genealogical classification of the (Narrow) Bantu languages. Until recently{{when|date=July 2017}} most attempted classifications only considered languages that happen to fall within traditional Narrow Bantu, but there seems to be a continuum with the related languages of South Bantoid.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}\n\nAt a broader level, the family is commonly split in two depending on the reflexes of proto-Bantu tone patterns:  Many Bantuists group together parts of zones A through D (the extent depending on the author) as ''Northwest Bantu'' or ''Forest Bantu'', and the remainder as ''Central Bantu'' or ''Savanna Bantu''. The two groups have been described as having mirror-image tone systems: where Northwest Bantu has a high tone in a cognate, Central Bantu languages generally have a low tone, and vice versa.\n\nNorthwest Bantu is more divergent internally than Central Bantu, and perhaps less [[conservative (language)|conservative]] due to contact with non-Bantu Niger\u2013Congo languages; Central Bantu is likely the innovative line cladistically. Northwest Bantu is clearly not a coherent family, but even for Central Bantu the evidence is lexical, with little evidence that it is a historically valid group.\n\nAnother attempt at a detailed genetic classification to replace the Guthrie system is the 1999 \"Tervuren\" proposal of Bastin, Coupez, and Mann.<ref>The Guthrie, Tervuren, and SIL lists are compared side by side in [https://web.archive.org/web/20090325021837/http://www.african.gu.se/maho/downloads/bantulineup.pdf Maho 2002].</ref> However, it relies on [[lexicostatistics]], which, because of its reliance on similarity rather than [[synapomorphy|shared innovations]], may predict spurious groups of [[polyphyly|conservative languages that are not closely related]]. Meanwhile, ''[[Ethnologue]]'' has added languages to the Guthrie classification which Guthrie overlooked, while removing the [[Mbam languages]] (much of zone A), and shifting some languages between groups (much of zones D and E to a new zone J, for example, and part of zone L to K, and part of M to F) in an apparent effort at a semi-genetic, or at least semi-areal, classification. This has been criticized for sowing confusion in one of the few unambiguous ways to distinguish Bantu languages. Nurse & Philippson (2006) evaluate many proposals for low-level groups of Bantu languages, but the result is not a complete portrayal of the family.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}} ''[[Glottolog]]'' has incorporated many of these into their classification.<ref name=Glottolog/>\n\nThe languages that share [[Dahl's law]] may also form a valid group, [[Northeast Bantu languages|Northeast Bantu]]. The infobox at right lists these together with various low-level groups that are fairly uncontroversial, though they continue to be revised. The development of a rigorous genealogical classification of many branches of Niger\u2013Congo, not just Bantu, is hampered by insufficient data.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}\n\n[[Computational phylogenetic]] analyses of Bantu include Currie, et al.

Each noun belongs to a [[noun class|class]], and each language may have several numbered classes, somewhat like [[grammatical gender]] in European languages. The class is indicated by a prefix that is part of the noun, as well as agreement markers on verb and qualificative roots connected with the noun. Plural is indicated by a change of class, with a resulting change of prefix.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}\n\nThe verb has a number of prefixes, though in the western languages these are often treated as independent words.<ref>Derek Nurse, 2008. ''Tense and aspect in Bantu'', p 70 (fn). In many of the Zone A, including [[Mbam languages|Mbam]], the verbs are clearly analytic.</ref> In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], for example, ''Kitoto kidogo amekisoma'' (for comparison, ''Kamwana kadoko karikuverenga'' in [[Shona language]]) means 'The small child has read it [a book]'. ''Kitoto'' 'child' governs the adjective prefix ''ki-''('ki' being a prefix representing the diminuitive form of the word) and the verb subject prefix ''a-''. Then comes perfect tense ''-me-'' and an object marker ''-ki-'' agreeing with implicit ''kitabu'' 'book' (from Arabic ''kitab''). Pluralizing to 'children' gives ''Watoto wadogo wamekisoma'' (''Vana vadoko varikuverenga'' in Shona), and [[plural]]izing to 'books' (''vitabu'') gives ''Watoto wadogo wamevisoma''.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}\n\nBantu words are typically made up of [[Syllable#Coda|open syllable]]s of the type CV (consonant-vowel) with most languages having syllables exclusively of this type. The [[Bushong language]] recorded by Vansina, however, has final consonants,<ref>Vansina, J. ''Esquisse de Grammaire Bushong''. Commission de Linguistique Africaine, Tervuren, Belgique, 1959.</ref> while slurring of the final syllable (though written) is reported as common among the [[Tonga (Nyasa) language|Tonga]] of Malawi.<ref>Turner, Rev. Wm. Y., ''Tumbuka\u2013Tonga$1\u2013$2 $3ictionEnglish Dictionary''  Hetherwick Press, Blantyre, Malawi 1952. pages i\u2013ii.</ref> The morphological shape of Bantu words is typically CV, VCV, CVCV, VCVCV, etc.; that is, any combination of CV (with possibly a V- syllable at the start). In other words, a strong claim for this language family is that almost all words end in a vowel, precisely because closed syllables (CVC) are not permissible in most of the documented languages, as far as is understood.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}\n\nThis tendency to avoid [[consonant cluster]]s in some positions is important when words are imported from [[English language|English]] or other non-Bantu languages. An example from [[Chewa language|Chewa]]: the word \"school\", borrowed from English, and then transformed to fit the sound patterns of this language, is ''sukulu''. That is, ''sk-'' has been broken up by inserting an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''-u-''; ''-u'' has also been added at the end of the word. Another example is ''buledi'' for \"bread\". Similar effects are seen in [[loanword]]s for other non-African CV languages like [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. However, a clustering of sounds at the beginning of a syllable can be readily observed in such languages as Shona,<ref>Doke, Clement M., ''A Comparative Study in Shona Phonetics'' University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, 1931.</ref> and the [[Makua languages]].<ref>''Relat\u00f3rio do I Semin\u00e1rio sobre a Padroniza\u00e7\u00e3o da Ortografia de L\u00ednguas Mo\u00e7ambicanas''  NELIMO, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane. 1989.</ref>\n\n===Reduplication===\n[[Reduplication]] is a common morphological phenomenon in Bantu languages and is usually used to indicate frequency or intensity of the action signalled by the (unreduplicated) verb stem.<ref>Abdulaziz Lodhi, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090325021837/http://www.african.gu.se/aa/pdfs/aa02004.pdf Verbal extensions in Bantu (the case of Swahili and Nyamwezi)]\". ''Africa & Asia,'' 2002, 2:4\u201326, G\u00f6teborg University</ref>\n\n*Example: in Swahili ''piga'' means \"strike\", ''pigapiga'' means \"strike repeatedly\".\n\nWell-known words and names that have reduplication include\n*[[South Africa national football team|Bafana Bafana]], a football team\n*[[Zambia national football team|Chipolopolo]], a football team\n*[[Eric Djemba-Djemba]], a footballer\n*[[Lomana LuaLua]], a footballer\n*[[Ngorongoro Conservation Area|Ngorongoro]], a conservation area\nRepetition emphasizes the repeated word in the context that it is used. For instance, \"Mwenda pole hajikwai,\" while, \"Pole pole ndio mwendo,\" has two to emphasize the consistency of slowness of the pace. The meaning of the former in translation is, \"He who goes slowly doesn't trip,\" and that of the latter is, \"A slow but steady pace wins the race.\" Haraka haraka would mean hurrying just for the sake of hurrying, reckless hurry, as in \"Njoo! Haraka haraka\" [come here! Hurry, hurry].\n\nIn contrast, there are some words in some of the languages in which reduplication has the opposite meaning.

Published for the International African Institute, Oxford University Press, 1959.</ref>\n\nMost languages are best known in English without the class prefix (''Swahili'', ''Tswana'', ''Ndebele''), but are sometimes seen with the (language-specific) prefix (''Kiswahili'', ''Setswana'', ''Sindebele''). In a few cases prefixes are used to distinguish languages with the same root in their name, such as [[Luba-Kasai language|Tshiluba]] and [[Luba-Katanga language|Kiluba]] (both ''Luba''), [[Umbundu]] and [[Kimbundu]] (both ''Mbundu''). The bare (prefixless) form typically does not occur in the language itself, but is the basis for other words based on the ethnicity. So, in the country of [[Botswana]] the people are the ''[[Tswana people|Batswana]]'', one person is a ''Motswana'', and the language is ''[[Setswana]]''; and in [[Uganda]], centred on the kingdom of ''[[Buganda]]'', the dominant ethnicity are the ''[[Baganda]]'' (sg. ''Muganda''), whose language is ''[[Luganda]]''.\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''[[Lingua franca]]'''\n*[[Swahili language|Swahili]] (Kiswahili) (350,000; tens of millions as L2)\n\n'''Angola'''\n*[[Umbundu|South Mbundu]] (Umbundu) (4 million)\n*[[Kimbundu|North Mbundu]] (Kimbundu) (3 million)\n*[[Ovambo language|Ovambo (Ambo)]] (Oshiwambo) (500,000)\n*[[Luvale language|Luvale]] (Chiluvale) (500,000)\n*[[Chokwe language|Chokwe]] (Chichokwe) (500,000)\n\n'''Botswana'''\n*[[Tswana language|Tswana]] (Setswana) (1.6 million)\n*[[Kalanga language|Kalanga]] (Ikalanga) (150,000)\n\n'''Burundi'''\n*[[Kirundi]] (8.5 - 10.5 million)\n\n'''Cameroon'''\n*[[Beti language|Beti]] (1.7 million: 900,000 [[Bulu language|Bulu]], 600,000 [[Ewondo language|Ewondo]], 120,000 [[Fang language|Fang]], 60,000 [[Eton language|Eton]], 30,000 Bebele)\n*[[Basaa language|Basaa]] (230,000)\n*[[Duala language|Duala]] (350,000)\n\n'''Central African Republic'''\n*[[Mbati language|Mbati]] (60,000)\n\n'''Democratic Republic of the Congo'''\n*[[Lingala|Lingala (Ngala)]] (2 million; 7 million with L2 speakers)\n*[[Luba-Kasai language|Luba-Kasai]] (Tshiluba) (6.5 million)\n*[[Kituba language|Kituba]] (4.5 million), a Bantu creole\n*[[Kongo language|Kongo]] (Kikongo) (3.5 million)\n*[[Luba-Katanga language|Luba-Katanga]] (Kiluba) (1.5+ million)\n*[[Songe language|Songe]] (Lusonge) (1+ million)\n*[[Nande language|Nande]] (Orundandi) (1 million)\n*[[Tetela language|Tetela]] (Otetela) (800,000)\n*[[Yaka language (Congo\u2013Angola)|Yaka]] (Iyaka) (700,000+)\n*[[Shi language|Shi]] (700,000)\n*[[Kongo language|Yombe]] (Kiyombe) (670,000)\n\n'''Equatorial Guinea'''\n*[[Beti language|Beti]] ([[Fang language|Fang]]) (300,000)\n*[[Bube language|Bube]] (40,000)\n\n'''Gabon'''\n*[[Baka language|Baka]]\n*[[Barama language|Barama]]\n*[[Bekwel language|Bekwel]]\n*[[Benga language|Benga]]\n*[[Bubi language|Bubi]]\n*[[Bwisi language|Bwisi]]\n*[[Duma language|Duma]]\n*[[Fang language|Fang]] (500,000)\n*[[Kande language|Kendell]]\n*[[Kaningi language|Kanin]]\n*[[Sake language|Sake]]\n*[[Sangu language (Gabon)|Sangu]]\n*[[Seki language|Seki]]\n*[[Sighu language|Sighu]]\n*[[Simba language|Simba]]\n*[[Sira language|Sira]]\n*[[Northern Teke language|Northern Teke]]\n*[[Western Teke language|Western Teke]]\n*[[Tsaangi language|Tsaangi]]\n*[[Tsogo language|Tsogo]]\n*[[Vili language|Vili]] (3,600)\n*[[Vumbu language|Vumbu]]\n*[[Wandji language|Wandji]]\n*[[Wumbvu language|Wumbvu]]\n*[[Yangho language|Yangho]]\n*[[Yasa language|Yasa]]\n\n'''Kenya'''\n:''Swahili and English are national languages''\n*[[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]] (7 million)\n*[[Luhya language|Luhya]] (5.4 million)\n*[[Kamba language|Kamba]] (4 million)\n*[[Meru language|Meru]] (Kimeru) (2.7 million)\n*[[Gusii language|Gusii]] (2 million)\n*[[Mijikenda language|Mijikenda]]\n*[[Taita language|Taita]]\n*[[Kiembu language|Kiembu]]\n*[[Kimbere language|Kimbere]]\n*[[Kigiriama language|Giriama]]\n\n\n\n\n'''Lesotho'''\n*[[Sotho language|Sesotho]] (1.8 million)\n*[[Zulu language|Zulu]] (Isizulu) (300,000)\n\n'''Malawi'''\n*[[Chewa language|Chewa (Nyanja)]] (Chichewa) (7 million)\n*[[Tumbuka language|Tumbuka]] (1 million)\n*[[Yao language|Yao]] (1 million)\n\n'''Mozambique'''\n*[[Makhuwa language|Makhuwa]] (3 million; 5.5 million all [[Makua languages|Makua]])\n*[[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] (Xitsonga) (3.1 million)\n*[[Ndau language|Shona (Ndau)]] (1.6 million)\n*[[Lomwe language|Lomwe]] (1.5 million)\n*[[Sena language|Sena]] (1.3 million)\n*[[Tswa language|Tswa]] (1.2 million)\n*[[Chuwabu language|Chuwabu]] (1.0 million)\n*[[Chopi language|Chopi]] (800,000)\n*[[Ronga language|Ronga]] (700,000)\n*[[Chewa language|Chewa (Nyanja)]] (Chichewa) (600,000)\n*[[Yao language|Yao]] (Chiyao) (500,000)\n*[[Nyungwe language|Nyungwe]] (Cinyungwe/Nhungue)(400,000)\n*[[Tonga language (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga]] (400,000)\n*[[Makonde language|Makonde]] (400,000)\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Namibia'''\n*[[Ovambo language|Ovambo (Ambo, Oshiwambo)]] (1 500,000)\n*[[Herero language|Herero]] (200,000)\n\n'''Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville)'''\n*[[Kituba language|Kituba]] (1.2+ million) [a Bantu creole]\n*[[Kongo language|Kongo]] (Kikongo) (1.0 million)\n*[[Teke languages]] (500,000)\n*[[Kongo language|Yombe]] (350,000)\n*[[Suundi language|Suundi]] (120,000)\n*[[Mboshi language|Mbosi]] (110,000)\n*[[Lingala]] (100,000; ?

A radar [[proximity fuse]] detonated the warhead, either a large conventional explosive or the [[W40 (nuclear warhead)|W40 nuclear warhead]].\n\nThe Air Force originally planned for a total of 52 sites covering most of the major cities and industrial regions in the US. The [[US Army]] was deploying their own systems at the same time, and the two services fought constantly both in political circles and in the press. Development dragged on, and by the time it was ready for deployment in the late 1950s, the nuclear threat had moved from manned bombers to the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM). By this time the Army had successfully deployed their [[Nike Hercules]] that filled any possible need through the 1960s, in spite of Air Force claims to the contrary.\n\nAs testing continued, the Air Force reduced its plans to sixteen sites, and then again to eight with an additional two sites in Canada. The first US site was declared operational in 1959, but with only a single working missile. Bringing the rest of the missiles into service took years, by which time the system was obsolete. Deactivations began in 1969 and by 1972 all Bomarc sites had been shut down. A small number were used as target drones, and only a few remain on display today.\n\n==Design and development==\nIn 1946, Boeing started to study surface-to-air guided missiles under the [[United States Army Air Forces]] project MX-606. By 1950, Boeing had launched more than 100 test rockets in various configurations, all under the designator XSAM-A-1 GAPA (Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft). Because these tests were very promising, Boeing received a USAF contract in 1949 to develop a pilotless interceptor (a term then used by the USAF for air-defense guided missiles) under project MX-1599. The MX-1599 missile was to be a ramjet-powered, nuclear-armed long-range surface-to-air missile to defend the Continental United States from high-flying bombers. The [[Michigan Aeronautical Research Center|Michigan Aerospace Research Center]] (MARC) was added to the project soon afterward, and this gave the new missile its name Bomarc (for Boeing and MARC). In 1951, the USAF decided to emphasize its point of view that missiles were nothing else than pilotless aircraft by assigning aircraft designators to its missile projects, and anti-aircraft missiles received F-for-Fighter designations. The Bomarc became the '''F-99'''.<ref name=\"Gibson\">Gibson 1996, pp. 200\u2013201.</ref>\n\nTest flights of XF-99 test vehicles began in September 1952 and continued through early 1955.{{r|McMullen1980_312}} The XF-99 tested only the liquid-fueled booster rocket, which would accelerate the missile to ramjet ignition speed. In February 1955, tests of the XF-99A propulsion test vehicles began. These included live ramjets, but still had no guidance system or warhead. The designation YF-99A had been reserved for the operational test vehicles. In August 1955, the USAF discontinued the use of aircraft-like type designators for missiles, and the XF-99A and YF-99A became XIM-99A and YIM-99A, respectively. Originally the USAF had allocated the designation IM-69, but this was changed (possibly at Boeing's request to keep number 99) to '''IM-99''' in October 1955. In October 1957, the first YIM-99A production-representative prototype flew with full guidance, and succeeded to pass the target within destructive range. In late 1957, Boeing received the production contract for the IM-99A Bomarc A interceptor missile, and in September 1959, the first IM-99A squadron became operational.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nThe IM-99A had an operational radius of {{convert|200|mi|km}} and was designed to fly at [[Mach number|Mach]]&nbsp;2.5\u20132.8 at a cruising altitude of {{convert|60000|ft|m}}. It was {{convert|46.6|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and weighed {{convert|15500|lb|kg}}. Its armament was either a {{convert|1000|lb|kg}} conventional warhead or a [[W40 (nuclear warhead)|W40 nuclear warhead]] (7\u201310 [[TNT equivalent|kiloton]] yield). A [[Liquid-propellant rocket|liquid-fuel rocket]] engine boosted the Bomarc to Mach 2, when its [[Marquardt RJ43|Marquardt RJ43-MA-3]] [[ramjet]] engines, fueled by 80-octane gasoline, would take over for the remainder of the flight. This was the same model of engine used to power both the [[Lockheed X-7]], the [[Lockheed AQM-60 Kingfisher]] drone used to test air defenses, and the [[Lockheed D-21]] launched from the back of an SR-71 .<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\n[[File:CIM-10 Bomarc missile battery.jpg|left|thumb|October 1960, BOMARCs in New Jersey ([[BOMARC Missile Accident Site|BOMARC Site No. 1]]) ]]\n\nThe operational IM-99A missiles were based horizontally in semi-hardened shelters, nicknamed \"coffins\". After the launch order, the shelter's roof would slide open, and the missile raised to the vertical. After the missile was supplied with fuel for the booster rocket, it would be launched by the Aerojet General LR59-AJ-13 booster. After sufficient speed was reached, the Marquardt RJ43-MA-3 ramjets would ignite and propel the missile to its cruise speed of Mach&nbsp;2.8 at an altitude of {{convert|20000|m|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nWhen the Bomarc was within {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip|round=5}} of the target, its own Westinghouse AN/DPN-34 radar guided the missile to the interception point. The maximum range of the IM-99A was {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and it was fitted with either a conventional high-explosive or a 10&nbsp;kiloton W-40 nuclear fission warhead.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nThe Bomarc relied on the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE), an automated control system used by [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] for detecting, tracking and intercepting enemy [[Bomber|bomber aircraft]]. SAGE allowed for remote launching of the Bomarc missiles, which were housed in a constant combat-ready basis in individual launch shelters in remote areas. At the height of the program, there were 14 Bomarc sites located in the US and two in Canada.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nThe liquid-fuel booster of the Bomarc A was no optimal solution. It took two minutes to fuel before launch, which could be a long time in high-speed intercepts, and its [[hypergolic propellant]]s (hydrazine and nitric acid) were very dangerous to handle, leading to several serious accidents.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nAs soon as high-thrust [[solid-fuel rocket]]s became a reality in the mid-1950s, the USAF began to develop a new solid-fueled Bomarc variant, the IM-99B Bomarc&nbsp;B. It used a [[Thiokol]] XM51 booster, and also had improved Marquardt RJ43-MA-7 (and finally the RJ43-MA-11) ramjets. The first IM-99B was launched in May 1959, but problems with the new propulsion system delayed the first fully successful flight until July 1960, when a supersonic KD2U-1/MQM-15A Regulus II drone was intercepted. Because the new booster took up less space in the missile, more ramjet fuel could be carried, increasing the range to {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The terminal homing system was also improved, using the world's first [[Pulse-Doppler radar|pulse Doppler search radar]], the Westinghouse AN/DPN-53. All Bomarc&nbsp;Bs were equipped with the W-40 nuclear warhead. In June 1961, the first IM-99B squadron became operational, and Bomarc&nbsp;B quickly replaced most Bomarc&nbsp;A missiles.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/> On 23 March 1961, a Bomarc&nbsp;B successfully intercepted a Regulus&nbsp;II cruise missile flying at {{cvt|100000|ft|m}}, thus achieving the highest interception in the world up to that date.\n\nBoeing built 570 Bomarc missiles between 1957 and 1964, 269 CIM-10A, 301 CIM-10B.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\n[[File:4751st Air Defense Squadron - ADC - Emblem.png|thumb|125px|4751st ADMS (Training) Emblem]]\n\nIn September 1958 Air Research & Development Command decided to transfer the Bomarc program from its testing at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to a new facility on [[Santa Rosa Island (Florida)|Santa Rosa Island]], immediately south of Eglin AFB [[Hurlburt Field]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. To operate the facility and to provide training and operational evaluation in the missile program, [[Aerospace Defense Command|Air Defense Command]] established the 4751st Air Defense Wing (Missile) (4751st ADW) on 15 January 1958. The first launch from Santa Rosa took place on 15 January 1959.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\nIn 1955, to support a program which called for 40 squadrons of BOMARC (120 missiles to a squadron for a total of 4,800 missiles), ADC reached a decision on the location of these 40 squadrons and suggested operational dates for each. The sequence was as follows: \u2026 l. McGuire 1/60 2. Suffolk 2/60 3. Otis 3/60 4. Dow 4/60 5. [[Niagara Falls BOMARC Missile Site|Niagara Falls]] 1/61\u20266 . Plattsburg 1/61 7. Kinross 2/61 8.

The 46th ADMS was assigned to the [[Eastern Air Defense Sector|New York Air Defense Sector]] at [[McGuire Air Force Base]], New Jersey. The training program, under the 4751st ADW used technicians acting as instructors and was established for a four-month duration. Training included missile maintenance; SAGE operations and launch procedures, including the launch of an unarmed missile at Eglin. In September 1959 the squadron assembled at their permanent station, the Bomarc site near McGuire AFB, and trained for operational readiness. The first Bomarc-A were used at McGuire on 19 September 1959 with Kincheloe AFB getting the first operational IM-99Bs. While several of the squadrons replicated earlier fighter interceptor unit numbers, they were all new organizations with no previous historical counterpart.<ref>[http://www.radomes.org/museum/documents/McGuireAFBBOMARCNJ1960NYADShistory.html \"46th Air Defense Missile Squadron.\"] ''NYADS 1960 Yearbook.''

Ongoing development and reliability problems didn't help, nor did Congressional debate over the missile's usefulness and necessity. In June 1959, the Air Force authorized 16 Bomarc sites with 56 missiles each; the initial five would get the IM-99A with the remainder getting the IM-99B. However, in March 1960, HQ USAF cut deployment to eight sites in the United States and two in Canada.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\n====Bomarc incident====\n{{main|BOMARC Missile Accident Site}}\n\nWithin a year of operations, a Bomarc&nbsp;A with a nuclear warhead caught fire at McGuire AFB on 7 June 1960 after its on-board helium tank exploded. While the missile's explosives did not detonate, the heat melted the warhead and released plutonium, which the fire crews spread. The Air Force and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] cleaned up the site and covered it with concrete. This was the only major incident involving the weapon system.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/> The site remained in operation for several years following the fire. Since its closure in 1972, the area has remained off limits, primarily due to low levels of plutonium contamination.<ref>Gambardello, Joseph A.

Otherwise the air defense missile squadrons maintained alert while making regular trips to Santa Rosa Island for training and firing practice. After the inactivation of the 4751st ADW(M) on 1 July 1962 and transfer of Hurlburt to [[Tactical Air Command]] for air commando operations the 4751st Air Defense Squadron (Missile) remained at Hurlburt and Santa Rosa Island for training purposes.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nIn 1964, the liquid-fueled Bomarc-A sites and squadrons began to be deactivated. The sites at Dow and Suffolk County closed first. The remainder continued to be operational for several more years while the government started dismantling the air defense missile network. Niagara Falls was the first BOMARC B installation to close, in December 1969; the others remained on alert through 1972. In April 1972, the last Bomarc B in U.S. Air Force service was retired at McGuire and the 46th ADMS inactivated <ref name=\"Gibson\"/> and the base was deactivated.<ref name=sand>{{cite news|author1=THOMAS P.

The last Bomarc A was phased out in December 1964. In April 1972 the last Bomarc B was retired. Test flights of XF-99 test vehicles began in September 1952 and continued through early 1955. The XF-99 tested only the liquid-fueled booster rocket, which would accelerate the missile to ramjet ignition speed. In February 1955, tests of the XF-99A propulsion test vehicles began. These included live ramjets, but still had no guidance system or warhead. The designation YF-99A had been reserved for the operational test vehicles. In August 1955, the USAF discontinued the use of aircraft-like type designators for missiles, and the XF-99A and YF-99A became XIM-99A and YIM-99A. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817173907/http://astronautix.com/lvs/bomarc.htm |archivedate=17 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=AFD100617>{{Cite report |date=Approved 17 December 1958, declassified |title=IM-99 Weapon System: 26 October - 28 November 1958 |url=http://www.secretsdeclassified.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100617-111.pdf |accessdate=4 August 2013 |quote=technical training facility at Eglin Air Force Auxiliary Field Number 9.

So I want your help!  How can we increase \"membership\" in Wikipedia--both readers ''and'' new writers?\n\nLet's brainstorm.  Please, add an idea below, or help develop ideas.  (Sometimes, a really great new idea is a slight variation on a just-OK old idea.)\n\nAlso, if you do any work that you think someone else might inadvertently replicate, can you please write it down here somehow (as on the [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Encyclopedia links solicited|Encyclopedia links solicited]] page)?  Thanks! --[[User:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]]\n\n==Urban poster campaign==\nSee [[meta:Wikimedia urban postering campaign]]!\n\n==Brainstormin'==\n* How about we do something like [[Spread Firefox]]? We could start our own publicity campaign, and if we ever get something like the NYT ad or the Firefox coins (see article) then I get the feeling wikipedia use would go WAY up! :D\n[[User:203.59.117.99|203.59.117.99]] 08:35, 22 August 2005 (UTC)\n* Solicit links from (mentioning [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia banners and logos]]):\n** Websites with substantial traffic, like [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/About.com|About.com]] (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Big traffic links solicited|Big traffic links solicited]])\n** People with lists of encyclopedias (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Encyclopedia list links solicited|Encyclopedia list links solicited]])\n** People with encyclopedia-type websites (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Encyclopedia links solicited|Encyclopedia links solicited]])\n** Best-of websites and similar resources (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Best of sites links solicited|Best of sites links solicited]])\n** Web sites for authors, films, whatever. There's always a list of links. Add a link to the Wikipedia Stephen King page to Stephen King web sites, to the Japan page on Japan web sites, and so on. \n\n* for individual articles, solicit links from:\n** related resources (particularly if we mention them in ''external links'')\n** directories such as [[LookSmart]], [[Open Directory Project]] and [[Yahoo!]]\n\n* Get people to add article review requests to [[User:Larry Sanger/Review requests]]; find reviewers for those articles.\n\n* Approach websites that might want free content, and help them to get their hands on Wikipedia's; this is something Bomis programmers and volunteers could work on.  Maybe after we're running Magnus' PHP code?\n\n* Post announcements on mailing lists.  But of what sort?  Obviously, we want to avoid spam.\n** Start ''and continue'' discussions about Wikipedia articles (for this, the help of Wikipedians will be necessary)\n** Simply announce the existence of Wikipedia, soliciting help.  I think this is actually plausible.\n** Recruit fans for specific areas of Wikipedia. For example, someone could drop by a [[Star Trek]] newsgroup and mention that our pages need work. I bet we'd have a huge Star Trek section in no time...\n\n* Possible solicitation letters:\n**[[/Sample solicitation]]\n**[[/Another sample solicitation]]\n**[[/Sample solicitation 3]]\n**[[/Skeptical solicitation]]\n\n* Post announcements on newsgroups.  But try to be careful to go slowly through them--make sure the post is specially-tailored to whatever group you post to.  A good strategy is to pick a Wikipedia article, point out a few problems with it, and post a link to the article, inviting people to make changes.  If you have posted an announcement to a newsgroup, will you please list it here: [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Newsgroups|Newsgroups]]. If you don't know much about newsgroups, go to http://groups.google.com.\n\n* Contact webmasters who have content-rich sites.  Get them excited about Wikipedia, and invite them to make their content part of something great.\n\n* Increase production of pages that are of interest to the search engines.  '''Look at [http://50.lycos.com/ the Lycos 50] and the [http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html Google Zeitgeist] and make sure that there are articles on all those topics.'''  I would say that writing some simple short biographies of famous people would help. It will help when we have reliable and regularly updated stats on what is popular.  One interesting thing about this is that other people may follow suit so that there is a \"trend\" on the site.\n\n* Increase the standing of Wikipedia with Bomis.  (There is a bug in the system which means that Wikipedia articles are not returned as often as they could be.  We're working on this.)\n\n* Work to get additional press coverage, following up on the NYT article as best we can.  [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Ideas for articles about Wikipedia and other press events|Ideas for articles about Wikipedia and other press events]].\n\n* Write a scholarly article about \"Empirical studies in social epistemology\" and get it published.\n\n* Write to authors of good books on subjects we need help on and invite them to write an article on Wikipedia. \n\n* Schools. Speak to any teachers you know and have them set up an exercise where their students write on various topics that are untouched. Students get school credit for their work, obviously and also get excited about participating. I've told my mother (who teaches grade 4), and her students are planning to do articles about australian mammals, some as-yet-untouched countries, etc.\n\n* Promote free content: Whenever you make a post on other content sites, include a statement that your content is GFDL, public domain, or whatever...\n\n* Get slashdotted once in a while.  For example submit article to Slashdot when we reach 150,000 articles, 200,000, etc...  [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 15:48 18 Jul 2003 (UTC)\n\n* Add an [[RSS (protocol)|RSS]] feed to syndicate the content. See [[meta:RDF spool]]\n\n* Would it be possible to make a subscription to an \"Article of the Day\" email. So someone subscribes and then every day they get a different entry in their mailbox. This is something that websters.com and dictionary.com do for \"word of the day\" definitions. It would probably need someone to take charge of it and select which entries go out (the random link too often goes to a stub or a disabmiguation page) I'll ([[user:MrWeeble]]) volunteer. It shouldn't be too hard to do - there's plenty of free (as in speech as well as in beer) software for this kind of thing \n\n*Just tell people about Wikipedia- like one-on-one\n\n* Suggest publications that came with CD or DVD to include converted static dump of Wikipedia (including viewer applications, if required) in their CD or DVD. Even better, suggest them to write an article about Wikipedia too.\n\n* Allow contributors to make highlights and notes on existing pages allowing them to keep track of their learning.  This will help develop user retention strengthening the sight for other potential users.\n\n(The above is just a start!  Please add to the list!)\n\n----\n\nMoved from [[Wikipedia:Village pump]] on [[Tuesday]], [[November 26]]th, [[2002]]:\n\n== Wikipedia Evangelism ==\nHi, I've mentioned this before and thought I'd mention it again. As I'm browsing the pedia I find articles that might interest friends/coworkers. I pop them a link in a quick hello message and ask them if they confirm the accuracy of the content...the response so far has been first one of wonder, then awe, then enthusiasm! And it's been a nice way to relate to some folks I'm not often in contact with. Anyway, I searched for [[evangelism]] and came up with nada around the 'pedia. Is there a place for sharing an evangelical/ 'help us' message of [[wikipedia]]? --[[User:DennisDaniels|dgd]]\n\nThere's some stuff at [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership]]. (Hint which wouldn't help here but may in general: after searching, go to the \"Power search\" box at the bottom of the screen and check the box for the 'Wikipedia' namespace. You'll get various about, help, documentation, etc pages that aren't supposed to show up when you're searching for encyclopedia articles.) Also check the [[m:Main Page|Meta-wikipedia]] where we keep general project discussion and misc stuff. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]] 20:42 Oct 22, 2002 (UTC)\n\nHow about doing what a lot of news web pages do?  They have a box at the bottom, \"Send this article to a friend\" with some kind of java mailer to ship it off and a box for you to add a signed message. [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]]\n:I like that idea too.

As far as I can tell, WikiPedia has no advertisements. I am on a college campus and one group I am associated with advertises for lots of free software (Firefox and OpenOffice mostly) that is useful to college students. We would definitely put up some Wikipedia posters if there were a couple simple advertisements we could print out. This should be done similarly to how the logo contests were. If the contests are run, the purpose should be to get at least four advertisements: fliers for letter/A4 paper in both black & white and color and posters for tabloid/A3 paper in both black & white and color, so that it is easy for people to print them off and put them up on bulletin boards and the like. (If advertisements are available and I cannot find them, they should be made much more obvious.) --[[User:Jamethknorth|Jamethknorth]] 02:25, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\n== Invitations ==\nrequesting permission to re-use somebody else's content in Wikipedia:\n* [[Wikipedia:Boilerplate request for permission]]\n* [[m:Standard email texts]]\n\n* Use Social Networks as a way to communicate.\n\nMoved from [[Wikipedia:Village pump]] on [[Wednesday]], [[June 9]]th, [[2004]]:\n\n==Invitation Letter==\nLast weekend, I went to a number of places where there were guided tours, and that got me thinking...''it would be nice if this person could contribute their knowledge of this place to Wikipedia...''\n\nI think there should be a standard letter to invite people to share their knowledge with Wikipedia, for when you come across someone who knows a lot about something.\n\nOr does a simlar thing already exist?

[[User:RealGrouchy|RealGrouchy]] 17:39, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)\n\n==Don't lose new and existing members!==\n\nThere are a lot of great ideas for bringing in new members here. But don't forget that, once they're here, we want to keep them! [[America Online]] is a great case study of how focusing too much on new members and not enough on serving existing members can actually ''lose'' overall membership. Wikipedia must be an useful, easy, and pleasurable experience for new users. The droves of contributors ensure that \"useful\" is not a problem, at least as far as content goes. To make it \"easy\", more attention needs to be paid the initial interface learning curve for newbies. Both \"pleasurable\" and \"useful\" are significantly impacted by outrageously long response times and frequent server down time, so we must be careful not to bring in new people faster than we can fix these ongoing problems. Give a person a bad taste in their mouth from their first experience with Wikipedia, and we may not see them again. (That's why I never went back to Ask Jeeves!, Encylopedia Britannica, and many other search and reference sites after finding more reliable ones.) -- [[User:Jeffq|Jeff Q]] 17:55, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)\n\n:I know what you mean.  I still consider myself a 'new member', but I spend a lot of time just looking through the hordes of confusing help pages before I made my first edit (I have never used the sandbox).  Luckily, I added an entry to my user page telling people that I am a new user, and asking for suggestions, and someone told me what they felt was the most important tips and links.\n\n: Now, I do things with more ease, because I can look at pages I've created (esp images) and see how others have edited my work, and I can adapt to that format in new pages.  However, I'm a follow-the-instructions kind of guy; we should have procedural stuff to tell people what they need to know about different things, like editing a page, and adding an image, etc. [[Wikipedia:Picture tutorial]] is a good example. - [[User:RealGrouchy|RealGrouchy]] 23:14, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)\n\n::I think Wikipedia does a pretty good job of explaining all the pieces that one needs to do various things. The problem is perhaps more the sheer size and quantity of things one should learn to feel truly Wiki-knowledgeable. I'm always coming across useful pages by accident. I just ran into [[Wikipedia:Style and How-to Directory]], some items of which I've read before, and some I've picked up by Wiki-osmosis, but I suspect this will give me another boost along the learning curve. I have two tips about the Sandbox I hadn't noticed mentioned anywhere:\n::# Most of the time, what you're testing is completely demonstrated in \"Show preview\", so you don't even need to worry about overwriting the main Sandbox &mdash; just keep your Edit window open until you're done, then Cancel or just close it.\n::# I ran across another Wikipedian (I forgot who) who had created their own Sandbox at User:<username>/Sandbox. It's easy to create such a page, and you never have to worry about what's in the main Sandbox or that someone might overwrite it, plus you can save stuff for extended testing.\n::I'll bet there are similar \"best practices\" tips scattered around, maybe even not so scattered. It's hard to know with some much to learn and find. But that's a Good Thing, mostly. -- [[User:Jeffq|Jeff Q]] 00:05, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)\n\n:There is a real need to make inforamtion about the project, especially help pages more ordered and useful. To give an example although I can find many pages which tell me that I can have a personal Sandbox there is no documentation on how to achieve this. There isn't even a forum where newbies can post a question and get an answer to their problem/request from someone more experienced, or if it exists it is not well publicised.--[[User:ChemRad|ChemRad]] 13:56, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)\n\n==From Wikipedia:Publicity==\nThere are numerous ways you can help publicize [[Wikipedia]], and thereby get more people to edit your work and make this into a real live encyclopedia.  Just think--in a few years, Wikipedia is probably going to be ''amazing.''  (Feel free to add to this list.)\n\n* Ask people to read and help:\n** If you've done a lot of work in some particular area, post an announcement to a mailing list or newsgroup telling people about your work and asking them to help.\n** If there hasn't been a lot of work in a particular area, post an announcement telling people about Wikipedia and asking them to help!\n** Tell friends and colleagues.  E-mail an announcement to them.  Ask them to check your work, or to write pages on their areas of specialization, or their hobbies, or whatever.\n\n* Publicize wiki pages:\n** Submit particular wiki pages (e.g., your \"baby\" pages) to search engines.\n** Link to Wikipedia from your websites. Linking to articles helps people find them and improves their ranking on search engines.\n** Ask other people to link to Wikipedia.\n\n* Publicize Wikipedia as a whole: \n** Observe (in writing and smugly) on other wikis that Wikipedia is easily the fastest-growing wiki in the world.\n** Add a link to Wikipedia to your e-mail or message board signature.\n** Share your joy of using Wikipedia with your friends and other people.\n\n==From Wikipedia talk:Publicity==\n=== Hard to find help on how to publicise the Wikipedia ===\n\nSo, I got it into my head that I wanted to add a link to the Wikipedia from my blog...easier said than done!

It seems that anyone in the developed world who hasn't heard about us yet soon will, either through word of mouth or the inevitable media coverage for such an important site.  Wikipedia is also currently dominating Google and other search engines, so there's really no need to solicit links anymore.  At this point, I think publicity efforts would be more useful if they were targeted.  For example we would like to recruit:\n* Experts for fields where articles are languishing\n* Translators\n* Editors from cultural minorities not well represented here\n* English-speaking residents of non-English-speaking countries\n\nThe amount of publicity that Wikipedia gets from media outlets is very large.  Even if we could muster enough posters and volunteers to distribute them to compete with sheer volume, we have little direct control over what the media will say about us (though Jimbo has been doing a good job acting as a spokesperson, at least for those outlets who ask us for our point of view).  The best way I think we can make sure that the large amounts of free publicity we are getting is ''good'' publicity, is to improve what it is people see when they visit the site.  Given that most criticism recently has been about accuracy and trust and the site claiming to be more than it's not (since people assume an \"encyclopedia\" is professionally reviewed), an excellent first step would be to make sure anything that's in an unacceptable state is clearly marked, even if we can't fix it right away.

As the keeper of a toll gate in [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]] on the [[Manchester]]-to-Liverpool [[Turnpike road|turnpike]], he purchased a horse and a cart with several seats, and began an omnibus service between those two locations. His pioneering idea was to offer a service where, unlike with a [[Stagecoaches|stagecoach]], no prior booking was necessary and the driver would pick up or set down passengers anywhere on request.  Later on, he added daily services to [[Buxton]], [[Chester]], and [[Sheffield]]. His line immediately sparked fierce competition and a dense network of omnibus services quickly sprouted in the area, often acting as feeders to the railways. In 1865, Greenwood's company and its competitors amalgamated into the [[Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company|Manchester Carriage Company]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gmts.co.uk/explore/history/history.html |title=A Short History of Public Transport in Greater Manchester}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plan de la ville de Paris repr\u00e9sentant les nouvelles voitures publiques - Entreprise g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Dames Blanches.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A Paris omnibus in 1828]]\n\nThe Paris omnibus was started in 1828 by a businessman named Stanislas Baudry, who had begun the first French omnibus line in [[Nantes]] in 1826. The name was said to come from the station of the first line in Nantes, in front of the store of a hat-maker named Omnes, who had a large sign on his building saying \"Omnes Omnibus\"  (\"All for all\" in Latin).  Following success in Nantes, Baudry moved to Paris and founded the Enterprise des Omnibus  on rue de Lancre, with workshops on the quai de Jemmapes.   In 1827 he commissioned an English coach-maker, [[George Shillibeer]], to design a vehicle that could be stable and carry a large number of passengers. Shillibeer's design worked,   On 28 April 1828, the first Paris omnibus began service, running every fifteen minutes between La Madeleine and la Bastille.  Before long, there were one hundred omnibuses in service,  with eighteen different itineraries.  A journey cost twenty-five centimes.  The omnibuses circulated between seven in the morning and seven in the evening; each omnibus could carry between twelve and eighteen passengers.  The busiest line was that along the Grand Boulevards;  it ran from eight in the morning until midnight. {{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1031-1032}}\n\nThe Paris omnibus service was an immediate popular success, with more than two and a half million passengers in the first six months.  However,  there was no reliable way to collect money from the passengers, or the fare collectors kept much of the money for themselves;  In its first years the company was continually on the verge of bankruptcy, and in despair, Baudry committed suicide in February 1830.   Baudry's partners reorganized the company and managed to keep it in business.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1031-1032}}\n\nIn September 1828, a competing company, les Dames-Blanches, had started running its own vehicles.  In 1829 and the following years, more companies with poetic names entered the business;  les Citadines, les Tricycles, les Orl\u00e9anises, les Diligentes, les \u00c9cossaises, les B\u00e9arnaises, les Carolines, les Batignollaises, les Parisiennes, les Hirondelles, les Jos\u00e9phines, les Excellentes, les Sylphides, les Constantines, les Dames-Fran\u00e7aises,  les Alg\u00e9riennes, les Dames-R\u00e9unies, and les Gazelles.  The omnibus had a profound effect on Parisian life, making it possible for Parisians to work and have a social life outside their own neighborhoods.{{sfn|H\u00e9ron de Villefosse|1959|page=317}}\n\nBy 1845, there were thirteen companies in Paris operating twenty-twenty three omnibus lines. In 1855, [[Napoleon III]] had them combined into a single company, the Compagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des omnibus, with a monopoly on Paris public transportation. Beginning in 1873, they were gradually replaced by tramways, and, beginning in 1906, by the ''omnibus automobile'', or motor bus. The last horse-drawn Paris omnibus ran on 11 January 1913, from Saint-Sulpice to La Villette. {{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1031-1032}}\n\n[[File:Shillibeer's first omnibus.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Shillibeer's first London Omnibus (1829)]]\n\nShillibeer built another bus for the [[Quaker]] [[Newington Academy for Girls]] near London; this had a total of 25 seats, and entered history as the first [[school bus]].\nShillibeer saw the success of the Paris omnibus in service and concluded that operating similar vehicles in London,  for the fare-paying public with multiple stops, would be a paying enterprise, so he returned to his native city. His first London \"Omnibus\", using the same design and name as the Paris vehicle, took up service on 4 July 1829 on the route between [[Paddington]] (The [[Yorkshire Stingo]]) and \"Bank\" ([[Bank of England]])  via the \"[[New Road (eighteenth century north London turnpike road)|New Road]]\" (now [[Marylebone Road|Marylebone Rd]]), [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] and [[City Road]]. Four services were provided in each direction daily.

Buses soon expanded their capacity, with additional seats for a few extra passengers provided alongside the driver. By 1845, passengers were being accommodated on the curved roofs, seated back to back in a configuration known as 'knife-board'.

[[Leeds]] and [[Bradford]] became the first cities to put trolleybuses into service in Great Britain on 20 June 1911.\n\n===Motor buses===\n[[File:Erste Benzin-Omnibus der Welt.jpg|thumb|The first internal combustion omnibus of 1895 ([[Siegen]] to [[Netphen]])]]\n\nIn [[Siegerland]], Germany, two passenger bus lines ran briefly, but unprofitably, in 1895 using a six-passenger motor carriage developed from the 1893 [[Benz Viktoria]].<ref name= Eckermann2001/> Another commercial bus line using the same model Benz omnibuses ran for a short time in 1898 in the rural area around [[Llandudno]], Wales.<ref name=Ward1974/>\n\n[[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft|Daimler]] also produced one of the earliest motor-bus models in 1898, selling a double-decker bus to the Motor Traction Company which was first used on the streets of London on 23 April 1898. <ref name=\"Daimler\">{{cite web |url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/1898-The-worlds-first-bus-series-launched-by-Daimler--a-mile.xhtml?oid=9913455 |title=1898: The world\u2019s first bus series launched by Daimler \u2013 a milestone for passenger transport - marsMediaSite |publisher=}}</ref> The vehicle had a maximum speed of 18 kph and accommodated up to 20 passengers, in an enclosed area below and on an open-air platform above.

One of five Daimler buses exported to Australia]]\n\nThe [[Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company]], which rapidly became a major manufacturer of buses in the US, was founded in Chicago in 1923 by [[John D. Hertz]]. [[General Motors]] purchased a majority stake in 1925 and changed its name to the Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company. They then purchased the balance of the shares in 1943 to form the [[GMC (Truck)|GM Truck and Coach Division]].\n\nModels expanded in the 20th century, leading to the widespread introduction of the contemporary recognizable form of full-sized buses from the 1950s. The [[AEC Routemaster]], developed in the 1950s, was a pioneering design and remains an icon of London to this day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aecsouthall.co.uk/ |title=AEC Southall Enthusiast page |publisher=Aecsouthall.co.uk |accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref> The innovative design used lightweight aluminium and techniques developed in aircraft production during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.londonbooks.co.uk/shop/page.php?xPage=articles.html&articleID=1 |publisher=Londonbooks.co.uk |title=he Bus We Loved book description, 12 September 2006}}</ref> As well as a novel weight-saving integral design, it also introduced for the first time on a bus [[independent suspension|independent front suspension]], [[power steering]], a fully [[automatic gearbox]], and [[Hydraulic brake|power-hydraulic braking]].<ref name=routemasterorghome>[http://www.routemaster.org.uk/ Routemaster.org] home page</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Athens bus interior in 2013.jpg|thumb|Interior of a bus]]\n\nFormats include [[single-decker bus]], double-decker bus (both usually with a [[rigid bus|rigid chassis]]) and [[articulated bus]] (or 'bendy-bus') the prevalence of which varies from country to country. High-capacity [[bi-articulated bus]]es are also manufactured, and passenger-carrying trailers\u2014either towed behind a [[rigid bus]] (a [[Trailer (vehicle)|bus trailer]]) or hauled as a trailer by a truck (a [[trailer bus]]). Smaller [[midibus]]es have a lower capacity and [[open-top bus]]es are typically used for leisure purposes. In many new fleets, particularly in local transit systems, a shift to [[low-floor bus]]es is occurring, primarily for easier accessibility. [[Coach (bus)|Coaches]] are designed for longer-distance travel and are typically fitted with individual high-backed reclining seats, seat belts, toilets, and [[audio-visual]] entertainment systems, and can operate at higher speeds with more capacity for luggage. Coaches may be single- or double-deckers, articulated, and often include a separate luggage compartment under the passenger floor. [[Guided bus]]es are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at bus stops and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or [[bus lane]]s. \n\n[[Bus manufacturing]] may be by a single company (an integral manufacturer), or by one manufacturer's building a bus body over a chassis produced by another manufacturer.\n\n==Design==\n\n===Accessibility===\n[[File:Praha, DOD 2006 Hostiva\u0159, Plo\u0161ina autobusu Karosa pro invalidy.JPG|thumb|Bus with [[wheelchair lift]] extended]]\n\n[[Transit bus]]es used to be mainly [[high-floor]] vehicles.  However, they are now increasingly of [[low-floor bus|low-floor]] design and optionally also 'kneel' [[air suspension]] and have electrically or hydraulically extended under-floor ramps to provide level access for [[wheelchair]] users and people with [[baby transport|baby carriages]]. Prior to more general use of such technology, these wheelchair users could only use specialist [[paratransit]] mobility buses.\n\nAccessible vehicles also have wider entrances and interior gangways and space for wheelchairs. Interior fittings and [[rollsign|destination displays]] may also be designed to be usable by the [[visually impaired]]. Coaches generally use [[wheelchair lift]]s instead of low-floor designs. In some countries, vehicles are required to have these features by [[Disability discrimination act|disability discrimination laws]].\n\n===Configuration===\nBuses were initially configured with an engine in the front and an entrance at the rear. With the transition to one-man operation, many manufacturers moved to mid- or rear-engined designs, with a single door at the front or multiple doors. The move to the low-floor design has all but eliminated the mid-engined design, although some coaches still have mid-mounted engines. Front-engined buses still persist for niche markets such as American school buses, some minibuses, and buses in less developed countries, which may be derived from truck chassis, rather than purpose-built bus designs. Most buses have two [[axles]], articulated buses have three.\n\n===Guidance===\n[[Guided bus]]es are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at bus stops and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or [[bus lane]]s. Guidance can be mechanical, optical, or electromagnetic. <!-- explain abbr. Guidance is often, but not exclusively, employed as part of a BRT scheme. --> Extensions of the guided technology include the [[Bombardier Guided Light Transit|Guided Light Transit]] and [[Translohr]] systems, although these are more often termed 'rubber-tyred trams' as they have limited or no mobility away from their guideways.\n\n===Liveries===\n[[Transit bus]]es are normally painted to identify the operator or a route, function, or to demarcate low-cost or premium service buses. Liveries may be painted onto the vehicle, applied using adhesive [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]] technologies, or using [[decal]]s. Vehicles often also carry [[bus advertising]] or part or all of their visible surfaces (as [[mobile billboard]]). [[Campaign bus]]es may be decorated with key campaign messages; these can be to promote an event or initiative.\n\n===Propulsion===\n[[File:Ride On 5312 at Glenmont.jpg|thumb|[[Ride On (bus)|Ride On]] [[hybrid electric bus]] with appropriate livery]]\n[[File:ASEAG 999 Seite.jpg|thumb|Articulated bus powered with [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]]]]\n\nThe most common power source since the 1920s has been the [[diesel engine]]. Early buses, known as trolleybuses, were powered by electricity supplied from [[overhead lines]]. Nowadays, electric buses often carry their own battery, which is sometimes [[Phileas (public transport)|recharged on stops/stations]] to keep the size of the battery small/lightweight. Currently, interest exists in [[hybrid electric bus]]es, [[fuel cell bus]]es, [[electric bus]]es, and ones powered by [[compressed natural gas]] or [[biodiesel]]. [[Gyrobus]]es, which are powered by the momentum stored by a [[flywheel]], were tried in the 1940s.\n\n===Dimensions===\n\nUnited Kingdom:\n\nMaximum Length: Single rear axle 13.5 meters. Twin rear axle 15 meters.<br>\nMaximum Width: 2.55 meters\n\nUnited States:\n\nMaximum Length: None <br>\nMaximum Width: 2.6 meters\n\n==Manufacture==\n{{Main article|Bus manufacturing}}\nEarly bus manufacturing grew out of carriage [[coachbuilding]], and later out of automobile or truck manufacturers. Early buses were merely a bus body fitted to a truck chassis. This body+chassis approach has continued with modern specialist manufacturers, although there also exist integral designs such as the [[Leyland National]] where the two are practically inseparable. Specialist builders also exist and concentrate on building buses for special uses or modifying standard buses into specialised products.\n\nIntegral designs have the advantages that they have been well-tested for strength and stability, and also are [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]]. However, two incentives cause use of the chassis+body model. First, it allows the buyer and manufacturer both to shop for the best deal for their needs, rather than having to settle on one fixed design\u2014the buyer can choose the body and the chassis separately. Second, over the lifetime of a vehicle (in constant service and heavy traffic), it will likely get minor damage now and again, and being able easily to replace a body panel or window etc. can vastly increase its [[service life]] and save the cost and inconvenience of removing it from service.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nAs with the rest of the [[automotive industry]], into the 20th century, bus manufacturing increasingly became globalized, with manufacturers producing buses far from their intended market to exploit labour and material cost advantages. As with the cars, new models are often exhibited by manufacturers at prestigious industry shows to gain new orders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  A typical city bus costs almost US$450,000.<ref name=\"Gross\">{{cite web |last1=Gross |first1=Daniel |title=Further |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/the_juice/2014/09/electric_buses_proterra_wants_to_rid_america_of_emission_spewing_buses.html |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Slate Group]] |accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:Sydney Buses (mo 1298) Custom Coaches 'Citaro' bodied Mercedes-Benz O405NH CNG on Loftus Street in Circular Quay (cropped).jpg|thumb|A [[Mercedes-Benz O405|Mercedes-Benz O405NH CNG]] public transit bus in [[Sydney]], Australia]]\n{{Main article|Public transport bus service}}\n\n[[Transit bus]]es, used on [[public transport bus service]]s, have utilitarian fittings designed for efficient movement of large numbers of people, and often have multiple doors. Coaches are used for longer-distance routes. High-capacity [[bus rapid transit]] services may use the bi-articulated bus or tram-style buses such as the [[Wright StreetCar]] and the [[Iveco Bus|Irisbus]] Civis.\n\nBuses and coach services often operate to a predetermined published [[public transport timetable]] defining the route and the timing, but smaller vehicles may be used on more flexible [[demand responsive transport]] services.\n{{clear right}}\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Foxity \u00e0 Louvre-Rivoli par Cramos (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|Tour bus being used in France]]\nBuses play a major part in the tourism industry. [[Tour bus]]es around the world allow tourists to view local attractions or scenery. These are often [[open-top bus]]es, but can also be by regular bus or coach.\n\nIn local [[sightseeing]], [[City Sightseeing]] is the largest operator of local tour buses, operating on a franchised basis all over the world. Specialist tour buses are also often owned and operated by [[safari park]]s and other [[Amusement park|theme parks or resorts]]. Longer-distance tours are also carried out by bus, either on a turn up and go basis or through a [[tour operator]], and usually allow disembarkation from the bus to allow touring of sites of interest on foot. These may be day trips or longer [[excursion]]s incorporating hotel stays. Tour buses often carry a tour guide, although the driver or a recorded [[audio commentary]] may also perform this function. The tour operator may itself be a subsidiary of a company that operates buses and coaches for other uses or an independent company that charters buses or coaches. [[Commuter]] transport operators may also use their coaches to conduct tours within the target city between the morning and evening commuter transport journey.\n\nBuses and coaches are also a common component of the wider [[package holiday]] industry, providing private airport transfers (in addition to general [[airport bus]]es) and organised tours and day trips for holidaymakers on the package.\n\nTour buses can also be hired as chartered buses by groups as part of sightseeing at popular holiday destinations. These private tour buses may offer specific stops like all the historical sights or specifically casinos or allow the customers the comfort to make their own itineraries as per the places and activities they want to cover while on their tour. Tour buses come with professional and informed staff, insurance and maintain state governed safety standards.  Not only this to make the experience for the tourists more comfortable provide facilities like entertainment units, luxurious reclining seats, large scenic windows, and even lavatories if needed.\n\nPublic long-distance coach networks are also often used as a low-cost method of travel by students or young people travelling the world. Some companies such as [[Topdeck Travel]] were set up to specifically use buses to drive the [[hippie trail]] or travel to places such as North Africa.\n\nIn many tourist or travel destinations, a bus is part of the [[tourist attraction]], such as the North American [[tourist trolley]]s, London's [[AEC Routemaster]] [[London Buses heritage routes (disambiguation)|heritage route]]s, or the [[customised buses]] of Malta, Asia, and the Americas. Another example of tourist stops are the homes of [[celebrities]], such as tours based near [[Hollywood]]. There are several such services between 6000 and 7000 Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.\n\n===Student transport===\n[[File:HCS bus49.JPG|thumb|US [[school bus]]]]\n{{Main article|Student transport}}\n\nIn some countries, particularly the USA and Canada, buses used to transport school children have evolved into a specific design with specified mandatory features.  American states have also adopted laws regarding motorist conduct around school buses, including serious fines and the possibility of prison time for passing a stopped school bus in the process of offloading children passengers. These [[school bus]]es feature things such as the [[school bus yellow]] livery and [[School bus crossing arm|crossing guards]]. Other countries may mandate the use of [[seat belts]]. As a minimum, many countries require a bus carrying students to display a [[:Commons:Category:School bus signs|sign]], and may also adopt yellow liveries. Student transport often uses older buses cascaded from service use, retrofitted with more seats or seatbelts. Student transport may be operated by local authorities or private contractors. Schools may also own and operate their own buses for other transport needs, such as class [[field trip]]s, or transport to associated sports, music, or other school events.\n\n===Private charter===\nDue to the costs involved in owning, operating, and driving buses and coaches, many bus and coach use a [[private hire]] of vehicles from [[charter]] bus companies, either for a day or two or a longer contract basis, where the charter company provides the vehicles and qualified drivers.\n\n[[File:BCI bodied Mercedes-Benz OC 500 RF BusWest 01.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a private bus operating for BusWest in [[Perth]]]]\n\nCharter bus operators may be completely independent businesses, or charter hire may be a subsidiary business of a public transport operator that might maintain a separate fleet or use surplus buses, coaches, and dual-purpose coach-seated buses. Many private [[taxicab]] companies also operate larger [[minibus]] vehicles to cater for group fares. Companies, private groups, and social clubs may hire buses or coaches as a cost-effective method of transporting a group to an event or site, such as a group meeting, [[racing]] event, or organised recreational activity such as a [[summer camp]]. Schools often hire charter bus services on regular basis for transportation of children to and from their homes. Chartered buses are also used by education institutes for transport to [[convention (meeting)|convention]]s, exhibitions, and [[field trips]]. Entertainment or event companies may also hire temporary shuttles buses for transport at events such as festivals or [[academic conference|conference]]s. [[Party bus]]es are used by companies in a similar manner to [[limousine]] hire, for luxury private transport to social events or as a touring experience. [[Sleeper bus]]es are used by bands or other organisations that tour between entertainment venues and require mobile rest and recreation facilities. Some couples hire preserved buses for their wedding transport, instead of the traditional car. Buses are often hired for [[parade]]s or [[procession]]s. [[Victory parade]]s are often held for triumphant sports teams, who often tour their home town or city in an [[open-top bus]]. Sports teams may also contract out their transport to a team bus, for travel to [[Road (sports)|away games]], to a [[Sports competition|competition]] or to a [[Final (competition)|final event]]. These buses are often specially decorated in a livery matching the team colours. Private companies often contract out private shuttle bus services, for transport of their customers or patrons, such as hotels, [[amusement park]]s, [[university campus]]es, or [[airport bus|private airport transfer]] services. This shuttle usage can be as transport between locations, or to and from [[parking lot]]s. High specification luxury coaches are often chartered by companies for [[Executive officer|executive]] or [[Very Important Person|VIP]] transport. Charter buses may also be used in tourism and for promotion (See Tourism and Promotion sections).\n\n===Private ownership===\n[[File:Taipei Taiwan Police-bus-01.jpg|thumb|right|Police bus]]\nMany organisations, including the police, [[not for profit]], social or charitable groups with a regular need for group transport may find it practical or cost-effective to own and operate a bus for their own needs. These are often [[minibus]]es for practical, tax and driver licensing reasons, although they can also be full-size buses. [[Cadet]] or [[Scouting|scout]] groups or other youth organizations may also own buses. Specific charities may exist to fund and operate bus transport, usually using specially modified mobility buses or otherwise accessible buses (See Accessibility section). Some use their contributions to buy vehicles and provide volunteer drivers.\n\nAirport operators make use of special airside [[airport bus]]es for crew and passenger transport in the secure [[Airside (airport)|airside]] parts of an airport. Some public authorities, police forces, and military forces make use of [[armoured bus]]es where there is a special need to provide increased passenger protection.  The [[United States Secret Service]] acquired two in 2010 for transporting dignitaries needing special protection.<ref>{{cite web |author=Robert Farley |title=Obama's Canadian-American Bus |url=http://www.factcheck.org/2011/08/obamas-canadian-american-bus/ |work=FactCheck |date=25 August 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> [[Police department]]s make use of [[police bus]]es for a variety of reasons, such as [[Prisoner transport vehicle|prisoner transport]], [[police officer|officer]] transport, temporary detention facilities, and as [[command post|command and control vehicles]].

These may take the form of temporary charter hire of service buses, or the temporary or permanent conversion and operation of buses, usually of [[Used good|second-hand]] buses. Extreme examples include converting the bus with displays and decorations or [[awning]]s and fittings. Interiors may be fitted out for exhibition or information purposes with special equipment or [[audio visual]] devices.\n\n[[File:AVBWU237 641(KMB) 14-09-2018.jpg|thumb|Advertisement on a bus]]\n\n[[Bus advertising]] takes many forms, often as interior and exterior adverts and all-over advertising liveries. The practice often extends into the exclusive private hire and use of a bus to promote a brand or product, appearing at large public events, or touring busy streets. The bus is sometimes staffed by promotions personnel, giving out free gifts. [[Campaign bus]]es are often specially decorated for a [[political campaign]] or other social awareness information campaign, designed to bring a specific message to different areas, or used to transport campaign personnel to local areas/meetings. Exhibition buses are often sent to public events such as [[fair]]s and festivals for purposes such as recruitment campaigns, for example by private companies or the [[armed force]]s. Complex [[urban planning]] proposals may be organised into a mobile exhibition bus for the purposes of public consultation.\n\n===Goods transport===\n{{Main article|Bruck (vehicle)}}\nIn some sparesly populated areas, it's common to use Brucks, buses with a cargo area to transport both passengers and cargo at the same time. They are especially common in the [[Nordic countries]].\n\n==Around the world==\n[[File:CamelitoLaHavane 01.jpg|thumb|right|Trailer bus]]\n{{See also|Category:Bus transport by country|List of buses}}\n\nHistorically, the types and features of buses have developed according to local needs. Buses were fitted with technology appropriate to the local climate or passenger needs, such as air conditioning in Asia, or [[Bicycle|cycle]] mounts on North American buses. The bus types in use around the world where there was little mass production were often sourced second hand from other countries, such as the [[Malta bus]], and buses in use in Africa. Other countries such as Cuba required novel solutions to import restrictions, with the creation of the \"camellos\" ([[camel]] bus), a specially manufactured [[trailer bus]].\n\nAfter the Second World War, manufacturers in Europe and the Far East, such as [[Mercedes-Benz buses]] and [[Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation|Mitsubishi Fuso]] expanded into other continents influencing the use of buses previously served by local types. Use of buses around the world has also been influenced by colonial associations or political alliances between countries. Several of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] followed the British lead and sourced buses from British manufacturers, leading to a prevalence of [[double-decker bus]]es. Several [[Eastern Bloc]] countries adopted trolleybus systems, and their manufacturers such as [[Trolza]] exported trolleybuses to other friendly states.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In the 1930s, Italy designed the world's only{{dubious|Triple decker bus|date=March 2013}} triple decker bus for the busy route between Rome and Tivoli that could carry eighty-eight passengers.  It was unique not only in being a triple decker but having a separate smoking compartment on the third level.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7-EDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA286&dq=popular+mechanics+1932+the+president+of+a+big&hl=en&ei=JIgVTcvHIM2AnQf50_3fDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Three Decker Auto Bus Carries 88 Persons\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1932</ref>\n\nThe buses to be found in countries around the world often reflect the quality of the local road network, with high floor resilient truck-based designs prevalent in several less developed countries where buses are subject to tough operating conditions. Population density also has a major impact, where dense urbanisation such as in Japan and the far east has led to the adoption of high capacity long [[multi-axle bus]]es, often double-deckers while South America and China are implementing large numbers of [[articulated bus]]es for [[bus rapid transit]] schemes.\n\n===Bus expositions===\nEuro Bus Expo is a [[Trade fair|trade show]], which is held bi-ennially at the UK's [[National Exhibition Centre]] in Birmingham. As the official show of the [[Confederation of Passenger Transport]], the UK's trade association for the bus, coach and light rail industry, the three-day event offers visitors from Europe and beyond the chance to see and experience, at first hand, the very latest vehicles and product and service innovations right across the industry. The next show will be held in November 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurobusxpo.com |title=Euro Bus Expo : Welcome to the European coach & bus industry exhibition |publisher=Eurobusxpo.com |accessdate=2013-04-17}}</ref>\n\nBusworld Kortrijk in [[Kortrijk]], Belgium, is the leading bus trade fair in Europe. It is held bi-ennially, last time October 2013 and next time October 2015.\n\n==Use of retired buses==\n[[File:GMBus.jpg|thumb|left|Retired [[General Motors|GM]] bus]]\n[[File:EM-leyland-tow-truck-1.jpg|thumb|right|Retired bus in Israel used as a tow truck]]\n\nMost public or private buses and coaches, once they have reached the end of their service with one or more operators, are sent to the [[wrecking yard]] for breaking up for [[scrap]] and [[spare part]]s. Some buses, while not economical to keep running as service buses, are often converted in some way for use by the operator, or another user, for purposes other than revenue-earning transport. Much like old cars and trucks, buses often pass through a [[Car dealership|dealership]] where they can be bought for a price or at auction.\n\nBus operators will often find it economical to convert retired buses to use as permanent [[training bus]]es for driver training, rather than taking a regular service bus out of use. Some large operators also converted retired buses into tow bus vehicles, to act as [[tow truck]]s. With the outsourcing of maintenance staff and facilities, the increase in company [[health and safety]] regulations, and the increasing [[curb weight]]s of buses, many operators now contract their towing needs to a professional [[vehicle recovery]] company.\n\nSome retired buses have been converted to static or mobile caf\u00e9s, often using historic buses as a [[tourist attraction]]. Food is also provided from a catering bus, in which a bus is converted into a mobile [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[Coffee break|break room]]. These are commonly seen at external [[filming location]]s to feed the cast and crew, and at other large events to feed staff. Another use is as an emergency vehicle, such as high-capacity [[ambulance bus]] or mobile [[command center]].\n\nSome organisations adapt and operate [[playbus]]es or learning buses to provide a [[playground]] or learning environments to children who might not have access to proper play areas. An ex-London [[AEC Routemaster]] bus has been converted to a mobile theatre and [[Runway (fashion)|catwalk fashion show]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/aug/16/theatre.londonlistings1 Event preview: Fashion Bus On The Square, London] ''The Guardian'', 16 August 2008</ref>\n\nSome buses meet a destructive end by being entered in [[banger racing|banger races]] or at [[demolition derby]]s. A larger number of old retired buses have also been converted into mobile holiday homes and campers.\n\n===Bus preservation===\nRather than being [[wikt:scrapped|scrapped]] or converted for other uses, sometimes retired buses are saved for preservation. This can be done by individuals, volunteer preservation groups or charitable trusts, museums, or sometimes by the operators themselves as part of a [[heritage fleet]]. These buses often need to undergo a degree of [[vehicle restoration]] to restore them to their original condition and will have their livery and other details such as internal notices and [[rollsign]]s restored to be authentic to a specific time in the bus's actual history. Some buses that undergo preservation are rescued from a state of great disrepair, but others enter preservation with very little wrong with them. As with other historic vehicles, many preserved buses either in a working or static state form part of the collections of [[List of transport museums|transport museums]]. Working buses will often be exhibited at rallies and events, and they are also used as charter buses. While many preserved buses are quite old or even vintage, in some cases, relatively new examples of a bus type can enter restoration. In-service examples are still in use by other operators. This often happens when a change in design or operating practice, such as the switch to one person operation or low floor technology, renders some buses redundant while still relatively new.\n\n==Modification as railway vehicles==\n{{Main|Railbus}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Buses|Transport}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Coach (bus)]]\n* [[Bicycle carrier]] (bus mounted bike racks)\n* [[Bus spotting]]\n* [[Bus station]]\n* [[Cutaway bus]]\n* [[Dollar van]]\n* [[Horsebus]]\n* [[Intercity bus]]\n* [[Intercity bus driver]]\n* [[List of fictional buses]]\n* [[Public light bus]]\n* [[Trackless train]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=Ward1974>{{Citation |title=The World of Automobiles: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Motor Car |volume=15 |first=Ian |last=Ward |publisher=Orbis |year=1974 |page=1773}}</ref>\n\n<ref name= Eckermann2001>{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLZeQwqNmdgC&pg=PA687#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=World History of the Automobile |first=Erik |last=Eckermann |publisher=SAE |year=2001 |ISBN=9780768008005 |pages=67\u201368 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last=Combeau |first=Yvan |title=Histoire de Paris |year=2013 |publisher=Presses Universitaires de France |location=Paris |ISBN=978-2-13-060852-3 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Fierro |first=Alfred |title=Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris |year=1996 |publisher=Robert Laffont |ISBN=2-221-07862-4 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=H\u00e9ron de Villefosse |first=Ren\u00e9 |title=HIstoire de Paris |year=1959 |publisher=Bernard Grasset |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons and category-inline|Bus|Bus transport}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* [http://www.buses.org American Bus Association]\n\n{{buses}}\n{{public transport}}\n{{bus rapid transit}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n\n[[Category:Bus transport| ]]\n[[Category:Buses| ]]\n[[Category:French inventions]]", "sha1": "4i5mracfd0rddvvzc74vjeva86gpuno"}}, {"title": "Bali", "ns": "0", "id": "4147", "revision": {"id": "866291628", "parentid": "866291475", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T13:36:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "Bluesatellite", "id": "9902762"}, "comment": "simplify", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{otheruses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}{{Use British English|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                            = Bali\n| native_name                     = {{nobold|{{script|Bali|\u1b29\u1b2e\u1b36}}}}\n| native_name_lang                = id<!-- ISO 639 code e.g. \"id\" for Indonesian -->\n| image_skyline                   = {{Photomontage\n| photo1a = Amed banner sunset.jpg \n| photo2a = GarudaWisnuKencana head.jpg\n| photo2b = Tanah-Lot Bali Indonesia Pura-Tanah-Lot-01.jpg\n| photo3a = Panorama of Bali from Besakih -

The name ''Bali dwipa'' (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning '''Walidwipa'''. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' to grow rice in [[wet-field cultivation]]. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\n\nThe Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of [[Hayam Wuruk]] is mentioned in the charters of 1384\u201386.

It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Cortes\u00e3o\n | first = Jaime\n | title = Esparsos, Volume III\n | publisher = Universidade de Coimbra Biblioteca Geral\n | year = 1975\n | location = Coimbra\n| page = 288 }}  \"...''passing the island of 'Balle', on whose heights the nau Sabaia, of Francisco Serr\u00e3o, was lost''\" \u2013 from Antonio de Abreu, and in [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] and Antonio Galv\u00e3o's chronicles.

The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.<ref name=\"ctpqur\"/> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\n\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at Buleleng on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his [[Wallace Line]] theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and [[Lombok]]. It has been found to be a boundary between species.

Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, [[Ayung River]], flows approximately {{cvt|75|km|mi}} (see [[List of rivers of Bali]]).\n\nThe island is surrounded by [[coral reefs]]. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have [[black sand]]. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small ''[[sampan]]'' boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of [[Tanah Lot]], they are not yet used for significant tourism.\n\n[[File:Bali panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Subak (irrigation)|Subak]] irrigation system]]\nThe largest city is the provincial capital, [[Denpasar]], near the southern coast.

The transition is known as the [[Wallace Line]], named after [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who first proposed a transition zone between these two major [[biome]]s.

The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.\n\nThe [[tourism industry]] is primarily focused in the south, while also significant in the other parts of the island.

Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active, investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.\n\nIn the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors improved value for their currencies.\n\nBali's tourism economy survived the [[Islamists]] terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0\u20132.3 million tourists.

This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.<ref>Slattum, J.

As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''[[odalan]]''. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |title=Short Post |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072104/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |title=Hectic, yet void, week |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072220/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n[[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of [[Balinese people]] are [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from [[Java]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumatra]], and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. [[Kawi language|Kawi]] and [[Sanskrit]] are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\n\n[[English language|English]] and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]], as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[German language|German]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Balinese art|Music of Bali|Balinese cuisine}}\n[[File:Kecak.JPG|thumb|left|A ''[[kecak]]'' dance being performed at [[Uluwatu Temple]], in Bali]]\n[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer, Bali, c. 2007]]\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. [[Balinese cuisine]] is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous [[Balinese dance]]s include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance).

On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ''ogoh-ogoh'' monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.\n\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), [[Ngaben|cremation]] or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''d\u00e9sa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<ref name=Herbst/> Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<ref name=Foley/> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ram\u00e9'', is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ram\u00e9''.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ubud Cremation 4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ngaben|Cremation]] in [[Ubud]]]]\n''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<ref name=Herbst/><ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 19.</ref>\n\nMost temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], pp.&nbsp;18\u201326.</ref>\n\n[[File:A collage of scenes from Barong dance of Bali Indonesia.jpg|thumb|left|Barong dance]]\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' [[Balinese dance|dance]] have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.<ref name=Sanger/>\n\nBalinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064353/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html| archivedate=7 February 2013<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"[[kasepekang]]\", or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nOther than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents Bali Arts Festival to showcase Bali\u2019s performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have.

[[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] and their disciples used this norm when translating the [[Bible]] and other liturgical literature from [[Greek language|Greek]] into Slavic.\n* '''Middle Bulgarian''' (12th to 15th centuries) \u2013 a literary norm that evolved from the earlier Old Bulgarian, after major innovations occurred. A language of rich literary activity, it served as the official administration language of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]].\n* '''Modern Bulgarian''' dates from the 16th century onwards, undergoing general grammar and syntax changes in the 18th and 19th centuries. Present-day written Bulgarian language was standardized on the basis of the 19th-century Bulgarian [[vernacular]]. The historical development of the Bulgarian language can be described as a transition from a highly [[synthetic language]] (Old Bulgarian) to a typical [[analytic language]] (Modern Bulgarian) with Middle Bulgarian as a midpoint in this transition.\n[[File:ZographensisColour.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Codex Zographensis]] is one of the oldest [[manuscript]]s in the Old Bulgarian language, dated from the late 10th or early 11th century]]\n''Bulgarian'' was the first \"Slavic\" language attested in writing. As Slavic linguistic unity lasted into late antiquity, the oldest manuscripts initially referred to this language was as \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u044a \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044f\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a, \"the Slavic language\". In the Middle Bulgarian period this name was gradually replaced by the name {{lang|cu|\u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u044a \u0431\u043b\u044a\u0433\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a}}, the \"Bulgarian language\". In some cases, the name {{lang|cu|\u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u044a \u0431\u043b\u044a\u0433\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a}} was used not only with regard to the contemporary Middle Bulgarian language of the copyist but also to the period of Old Bulgarian. A most notable example of anachronism is the Service of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|St. Cyril]] from Skopje (\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439), a 13th-century Middle Bulgarian manuscript from northern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] according to which St. Cyril preached with \"Bulgarian\" books among the Moravian Slavs. The first mention of the language as the \"Bulgarian language\" instead of the \"Slavonic language\" comes in the work of the Greek clergy of the [[Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid]] in the 11th century, for example in the [[Greek language|Greek]] hagiography of [[Saint Clement of Ohrid]] by [[Theophylact of Bulgaria|Theophylact]] of Ohrid (late 11th century).\n[[File:Old Bulgarian alphabet.png|left|thumb|[[Cyrillic]]]]\nDuring the Middle Bulgarian period, the language underwent dramatic changes, losing the Slavonic [[case system]], but preserving the rich verb system (while the development was exactly the opposite in other Slavic languages) and developing a definite article. It was influenced by its non-Slavic neighbors in the [[Balkan language area]] (mostly grammatically) and later also by [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which was the official language of the [[Ottoman Empire]], in the form of the [[Ottoman Turkish language]], mostly lexically. As a [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] occurred toward the end of the period of Ottoman rule (mostly during the 19th century), a modern Bulgarian literary language gradually emerged that drew heavily on [[Old Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic/Old Bulgarian]] (and to some extent on literary [[Russian language|Russian]], which had preserved many lexical items from Church Slavonic) and later reduced the number of Turkish and other Balkan loans. Today one difference between Bulgarian dialects in the country and literary spoken Bulgarian is the significant presence of Old Bulgarian words and even word forms in the latter. Russian loans are distinguished from Old Bulgarian ones on the basis of the presence of specifically Russian phonetic changes, as in \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 (turnover, rev), \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043d (incomprehensible), \u044f\u0434\u0440\u043e (nucleus) and others. As usual in such{{which|date=March 2018}} cases, many other loans from French, English and the [[classical language]]s have subsequently entered the language as well.\n\nModern Bulgarian was based essentially on the Eastern dialects of the language, but its pronunciation is in many respects a compromise between East and West Bulgarian (see especially the phonetic sections below). Following the efforts of some figures of the [[National awakening of Bulgaria]] (most notably [[Neofit Rilski]] and [[Ivan Bogorov]]),<ref>Michal Kope\u010dek. ''Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770\u20131945): texts and commentaries, Volume 1'' (Central European University Press, 2006), p. 248</ref> there had been many attempts to [[Codification (linguistics)|codify]] a [[Standard language|standard]] Bulgarian language; however, there was much argument surrounding the choice of norms. Between 1835 and 1878 more than 25 proposals were put forward and \"linguistic chaos\" ensued.<ref name=\"Glanville Price 2000 p.45\">Glanville Price.

The letter was used in each occurrence of such a root, regardless of the actual pronunciation of the vowel: thus, both ''ml'''ya'''ko'' and ''ml'''e'''kar'' were spelled with (\u0462). <!--If anyone doubts, as the previous wording seemed to suggest, that the Eastern alternation was already considered literary norm at the time, see e.g. \u041c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d. \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0435\u0442\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a. 1941. p.XV-XVII.--> Among other things, this was seen as a way to \"reconcile\" the Western and the Eastern dialects and maintain language unity at a time when much of Bulgaria's Western dialect area was controlled by [[Serbia]] and [[Greece]], but there were still hopes and occasional attempts to recover it. With the 1945 orthographic reform, this letter was abolished and the present spelling was introduced, reflecting the alternation in pronunciation.\n\nThis had implications for some grammatical constructions:\n*The third person plural pronoun and its derivatives. Before 1945 the pronoun \"they\" was spelled \u0442\u0463 (''t\u011b''), and its derivatives took this as the root. After the orthographic change, the pronoun and its derivatives were given an equal share of soft and hard spellings:\n**\"they\" \u2013 \u0442'''\u0435''' (''te'') \u2192 \"them\" \u2013 \u0442'''\u044f'''\u0445 (''tyah'');\n**\"their(s)\" \u2013 ''t'''e'''hen'' (masc.); ''t'''ya'''hna'' (fem.); ''t'''ya'''hno'' (neut.); ''t'''e'''hni'' (plur.)\n*adjectives received the same treatment as \u0442\u0463:\n**\"whole\" \u2013 ''ts'''ya'''l'' \u2192 \"the whole...\": ''ts'''e'''liyat'' (masc.); ''ts'''ya'''lata'' (fem.); ''ts'''ya'''loto'' (neut.); ''ts'''e'''lite'' (plur.)\n\nSometimes, with the changes, words began to be spelled as other words with different meanings, e.g.:\n*\u0441\u0432\u0463\u0442 (''sv\u011bt'') \u2013 \"world\" became \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442 (''svyat''), spelt and pronounced the same as \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442 \u2013 \"holy\".\n*\u0442\u0463 (''t\u011b'') \u2013 \"they\" became \u0442\u0435 (''te''),\n\nIn spite of the literary norm regarding the yat vowel, many people living in Western Bulgaria, including the capital [[Sofia]], will fail to observe its rules. While the norm requires the realizations ''vidyal'' vs. ''videli'' (he has seen; they have seen), some natives of Western Bulgaria will preserve their local dialect pronunciation with \"e\" for all instances of \"yat\" (e.g. ''videl'', ''videli''). Others, attempting to adhere to the norm, will actually use the \"ya\" sound even in cases where the standard language has \"e\" (e.g. ''vidyal'', ''vidyali''). The latter [[hypercorrection#Bulgarian|hypercorrection]] is called \u0441\u0432\u0440\u044a\u0445\u044f\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435 (''svrah-yakane'' \u2248\"over-''ya''-ing\").\n\n;Shift from {{IPA|/j\u025b/}} to {{IPA|/\u025b/}}\nBulgarian is the only Slavic language whose literary standard does not naturally contain the [[Iotation|iotated]] sound {{IPA|/j\u025b/}} (or its palatalized variant {{IPA|/\u02b2\u025b/}}, except in non-Slavic foreign-loaned words).

The alphabet of Marin Drinov was used until the orthographic reform of 1945, when the letters [[Yat|\u0462]], \u0463 (called ''[[w:bg:\u042f\u0442|\u044f\u0442]]'' 'yat' or ''\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e \u0435''/''\u0435-\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e'' 'double e'), and [[Big Yus|\u046a]], \u046b (called ''[[w:bg:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043c \u044e\u0441|\u0413\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043c \u044e\u0441]]'' 'big yus', ''\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430'' 'big nasal sign', ''\u044a \u043a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e'' 'crossed [[yer]]' or ''\u0448\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e \u044a'' 'long [[yer]]'), were removed from its alphabet, reducing the number of letters to 30.\n\nWith the [[accession of Bulgaria to the European Union]] on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the [[European Union]], following the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Greek script]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Leonard Orban|title=Cyrillic, the third official alphabet of the EU, was created by a truly multilingual European|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-07-330_en.pdf|website=europe.eu|accessdate=3 August 2014|date=24 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Bulgarian phonology}}\n[[File:Bulgarian flag with Yat and Big Yus.svg|thumb]]\nBulgarian possesses a phonology similar to that of the rest of the South Slavic languages, notably lacking Serbo-Croatian's phonemic vowel length and tones and alveo-palatal affricates. The eastern dialects exhibit palatalization of consonants before front vowels ({{IPAslink|\u025b}} and {{IPAslink|i}}) and reduction of vowel phonemes in unstressed position (causing mergers of {{IPAslink|\u025b}} and  {{IPAslink|i}}, {{IPAslink|\u0254}} and  {{IPAslink|u}}, {{IPAslink|a}} and {{IPAslink|\u0264}}) - both patterns have partial parallels in Russian and lead to a partly similar sound. The western dialects are like Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian in that they do not have allophonic palatalization and have only little vowel reduction.\n\nBulgarian has six vowel phonemes, but at least eight distinct phones can be distinguished when reduced allophones are taken into consideration.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Bulgarian grammar}}\nThe parts of speech in Bulgarian are divided in 10 types, which are categorized in two broad classes: mutable and immutable. The difference is that mutable parts of speech vary grammatically, whereas the immutable ones do not change, regardless of their use. The five classes of mutables are: ''nouns'', ''adjectives'', ''numerals'', ''pronouns'' and ''verbs''. Syntactically, the first four of these form the group of the noun or the nominal group. The immutables are: ''adverbs'', ''prepositions'', ''conjunctions'', ''particles'' and ''interjections''. Verbs and adverbs form the group of the verb or the verbal group.\n\n===Nominal morphology===\n{{Main|Bulgarian nouns}}\nNouns and adjectives have the [[grammatical category|categories]] [[grammatical gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical case|case]] (only [[vocative case|vocative]]) and [[definite article|definiteness]] in Bulgarian. Adjectives and adjectival pronouns agree with nouns in number and gender. Pronouns have gender and number and retain (as in nearly all [[Indo-European languages]]) a more significant part of the case system.\n\n====Nominal inflection====\n=====Gender=====\nThere are three grammatical genders in Bulgarian: ''masculine'', ''feminine'' and ''neuter''. The gender of the noun can largely be inferred from its ending: nouns ending in a consonant (\"zero ending\") are generally masculine (for example, \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 {{IPA|/\u0261rat/}} 'city', \u0441\u0438\u043d {{IPA|/sin/}} 'son', \u043c\u044a\u0436 {{IPA|/m\u0264\u0283/}} 'man'; those ending in&nbsp;\u2013\u0430/\u2013\u044f (-a/-ya) (\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 {{IPA|/\u0292\u025b\u02c8na/}} 'woman', \u0434\u044a\u0449\u0435\u0440\u044f {{IPA|/d\u0250\u0283t\u025br\u02c8ja/}} 'daughter', \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 {{IPA|/\u02c8ulits\u0250/}} 'street') are normally feminine; and nouns ending in&nbsp;\u2013\u0435,&nbsp;\u2013\u043e are almost always neuter (\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 {{IPA|/d\u025b\u02c8t\u025b/}}{{fix|text=stress?|date=December 2017}} 'child', \u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u043e {{IPA|/\u02c8\u025bz\u025bro/}} 'lake'), as are those rare words (usually loanwords) that end in&nbsp;\u2013\u0438,&nbsp;\u2013\u0443, and&nbsp;\u2013\u044e (\u0446\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 {{IPA|/tso\u02c8nami/}} 'tsunami', \u0442\u0430\u0431\u0443 {{IPA|/t\u0250\u02c8bu/}} 'taboo', \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044e {{IPA|/m\u025b\u02c8nju/}} 'menu'). Perhaps the most significant exception from the above are the relatively numerous nouns that end in a consonant and yet are feminine: these comprise, firstly, a large group of nouns with zero ending expressing quality, degree or an abstraction, including all nouns ending on&nbsp;\u2013\u043e\u0441\u0442/\u2013\u0435\u0441\u0442 -<nowiki/>{ost/est} (\u043c\u044a\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442 {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u0264drost/}} 'wisdom', \u043d\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0441\u0442 {{IPA|/\u02c8nizost/}} 'vileness', \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442 {{IPA|/\u02c8pr\u025bl\u025bst/}} 'loveliness', \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442 {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0254l\u025bst/}} 'sickness', \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432 {{IPA|/lju\u02c8b\u0254f/}} 'love'), and secondly, a much smaller group of irregular nouns with zero ending which define tangible objects or concepts (\u043a\u0440\u044a\u0432 {{IPA|/kr\u0264f/}} 'blood', \u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442 {{IPA|/k\u0254st/}} 'bone', \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440 {{IPA|/\u02c8v\u025bt\u0283\u025br/}} 'evening', \u043d\u043e\u0449 {{IPA|/n\u0254\u0283t/}} 'night'). There are also some commonly used words that end in a vowel and yet are masculine: \u0431\u0430\u0449\u0430 'father', \u0434\u044f\u0434\u043e 'grandfather', \u0447\u0438\u0447\u043e / \u0432\u0443\u0439\u0447\u043e 'uncle', and others.\n\nThe plural forms of the nouns do not express their gender as clearly as the singular ones, but may also provide some clues to it: the ending&nbsp;\u2013\u0438 (-i) is more likely to be used with a masculine or feminine noun (\u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438 {{IPA|/\u02c8fakti/}} 'facts', \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0254l\u025bsti/}} 'sicknesses'), while one in&nbsp;\u2013\u0430/\u2013\u044f belongs more often to a neuter noun (\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 {{IPA|/\u025bz\u025b\u02c8ra/}} 'lakes'). Also, the plural ending&nbsp;\u2013\u043e\u0432\u0435 {{IPA|/ov\u025b/}} occurs only in masculine nouns.\n\n=====Number=====\nTwo numbers are distinguished in Bulgarian&nbsp;\u2013 [[Grammatical number|singular]] and [[plural]]. A variety of plural suffixes is used, and the choice between them is partly determined by their ending in singular and partly influenced by gender; in addition, irregular declension and alternative plural forms are common. Words ending in&nbsp;\u2013\u0430/\u2013\u044f (which are usually feminine) generally have the plural ending&nbsp;\u2013\u0438, upon dropping of the singular ending. Of nouns ending in a consonant, the feminine ones also use&nbsp;\u2013\u0438, whereas the masculine ones usually have&nbsp;\u2013\u0438 for polysyllables and&nbsp;\u2013\u043e\u0432\u0435 for monosyllables (however, exceptions are especially common in this group). Nouns ending in&nbsp;\u2013\u043e/\u2013\u0435 (most of which are neuter) mostly use the suffixes&nbsp;\u2013\u0430,&nbsp;\u2013\u044f (both of which require the dropping of the singular endings) and&nbsp;\u2013\u0442\u0430.\n\nWith [[cardinal number]]s and related words such as \u043d\u044f\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e ('several'), masculine nouns use a special count form in&nbsp;\u2013\u0430/\u2013\u044f, which stems from the Proto-Slavonic [[dual grammatical number|dual]]: \u0434\u0432\u0430/\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0430 ('two/three chairs') versus \u0442\u0435\u0437\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435 ('these chairs'); cf. feminine \u0434\u0432\u0435/\u0442\u0440\u0438/\u0442\u0435\u0437\u0438 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438 ('two/three/these books') and neuter \u0434\u0432\u0435/\u0442\u0440\u0438/\u0442\u0435\u0437\u0438 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0430 ('two/three/these beds'). However, a recently developed language norm requires that count forms should only be used with masculine nouns that do not denote persons. Thus, \u0434\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0430/\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 ('two/three students') is perceived as more correct than \u0434\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0430/\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430, while the distinction is retained in cases such as \u0434\u0432\u0430/\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430 ('two/three pencils') versus \u0442\u0435\u0437\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0438 ('these pencils').\n\n=====Case=====\n{{Main|Bulgarian grammar#Case system|l1=Case system of Bulgarian}}\n[[File:Bulgariancursiveg.svg|thumb|upright=0.15|\u0414 \u0434]]\nCases exist only in the [[personal pronoun|personal]] and some other [[pronoun]]s (as they do in many other modern [[Indo-European languages]]), with [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]] and [[vocative case|vocative]] forms. Vestiges are present in a number of phraseological units and sayings. The major exception are [[vocative case|vocative]] forms, which are still in use for masculine (with the endings -\u0435, -\u043e and -\u044e) and feminine nouns (-[\u044c/\u0439]\u043e and -\u0435) in the singular.\n\n=====Definiteness (article)=====\nIn modern Bulgarian, definiteness is expressed by a [[definite article]] which is postfixed to the noun, much like in the [[Scandinavian languages]] or [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (indefinite: \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a, 'person'; definite: \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u044a\u0442''', \"''the'' person\") or to the first nominal constituent of definite noun phrases (indefinite: \u0434\u043e\u0431\u044a\u0440 \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a, 'a good person'; definite: \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438'''\u044f\u0442''' \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a, \"''the'' good person\"). There are four singular definite articles. Again, the choice between them is largely determined by the noun's ending in the singular.<ref>\u041f\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0432, \u041f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440 (1999) \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430. \u0421\u0442\u0440.73\u201374.</ref> Nouns that end in a consonant and are masculine use \u2013\u044a\u0442/\u2013\u044f\u0442, when they are [[grammatical subject]]s, and \u2013\u0430/\u2013\u044f elsewhere. Nouns that end in a consonant and are feminine, as well as nouns that end in \u2013\u0430/\u2013\u044f (most of which are feminine, too) use \u2013\u0442\u0430. Nouns that end in \u2013\u0435/\u2013\u043e use \u2013\u0442\u043e.\n\nThe plural definite article is \u2013\u0442\u0435 for all nouns except for those whose plural form ends in \u2013\u0430/\u2013\u044f; these get \u2013\u0442\u0430 instead. When postfixed to adjectives the definite articles are \u2013\u044f\u0442/\u2013\u044f for masculine gender (again, with the longer form being reserved for grammatical subjects), \u2013\u0442\u0430 for feminine gender, \u2013\u0442\u043e for neuter gender, and \u2013\u0442\u0435 for plural.\n\n;Modern developments\n[[File:Keyboard Layout Bulgarian Phonetic2.png|thumb]]\nIn Bulgarian adjective-noun phrases, only the adjective takes a definite article ending \u2013\n*''chervena'''ta''' masa'' \u2013 the red table\n*''cherveni'''yat''' stol'' \u2013 the red chair\nMany of the English loanwords which have been adopted into the language since the [[Revolutions of 1989#Bulgaria|end of communism]], however, do not readily lend themselves to taking adjectival endings. This has caused an unprecedented shift in the language whereby, in certain cases, the adjective remains uninflected, while the noun following it takes the grammatical ending.

They may also take the definite article as explained above.\n\n====Pronouns====\n{{Main|Bulgarian pronouns}}\nPronouns may vary in gender, number, and definiteness, and are the only parts of speech that have retained case inflections. Three cases are exhibited by some groups of pronouns \u2013 nominative, accusative and dative. The distinguishable types of pronouns include the following: personal, relative, reflexive, interrogative, negative, indefinitive, summative and possessive.\n\n===Verbal morphology and grammar===\n{{Main|Bulgarian verbs}}\nThe Bulgarian verb can take up to 3,000<ref>[http://folk.uio.no/kjetilrh/bulg/gram/600bverb.html The Bulgarian Verb] ''Elementary On-Line Bulgarian Grammar'' by Katina Bontcheva, retrieved on 21 August 2011</ref>{{Dubious|3.2C000_verb_forms.3F|date=August 2011}} distinct forms, as it varies in person, number, voice, aspect, mood, tense and even gender.\n\n====Finite verbal forms====\nFinite verbal forms are ''simple'' or ''compound'' and agree with subjects in person (first, second and third) and number (singular, plural). In addition to that, past compound forms using participles vary in gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and voice (active and passive) as well as aspect (perfective/aorist and imperfective).\n\n=====Aspect=====\nBulgarian verbs express [[lexical aspect]]: perfective verbs signify the completion of the action of the verb and form past perfective (aorist) forms; imperfective ones are neutral with regard to it and form past imperfective forms. Most Bulgarian verbs can be grouped in perfective-imperfective pairs (imperfective/perfective: \u0438\u0434\u0432\u0430\u043c/\u0434\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0430 \"come\", \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0433\u0430\u043c/\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0433\u043d\u0430 \"arrive\"). Perfective verbs can be usually formed from imperfective ones by suffixation or prefixation, but the resultant verb often deviates in meaning from the original. In the pair examples above, aspect is stem-specific and therefore there is no difference in meaning.\n\nIn Bulgarian, there is also [[grammatical aspect]]. Three grammatical aspects are distinguishable: neutral, perfect and pluperfect. The neutral aspect comprises the three simple tenses and the future tense. The pluperfect is manifest in tenses that use double or triple auxiliary \"be\" participles like the past pluperfect subjunctive. Perfect constructions use a single auxiliary \"be\".\n\n=====Mood=====\nThe traditional interpretation is that in addition to the four moods (\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f {{IPA|/n\u0259klo\u02c8n\u025bnij\u0250/}}) shared by most other European languages \u2013 [[indicative mood|indicative]] (\u0438\u0437\u044f\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e, {{IPA|/iz\u02b2\u0259\u02c8vit\u025b\u026bno/}}) [[imperative mood|imperative]] (\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e {{IPA|/pove\u02c8litelno/}}), [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e {{IPA|/pott\u0283i\u02c8nit\u025b\u026bno/}}) and [[conditional mood|conditional]] (\u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e, {{IPA|/o\u02c8s\u026b\u0254vno/}}) \u2013 in Bulgarian there is one more to describe a general category of unwitnessed events \u2013 the [[inferential mood|inferential]] (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e {{IPA|/pr\u025b\u02c8isk\u0250zno/}}) mood. However, most contemporary Bulgarian linguists usually exclude the subjunctive mood and the inferential mood from the list of Bulgarian moods (thus placing the number of Bulgarian moods at a total of 3: indicative, imperative and conditional)<ref>\u0417\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0412\u0430\u043d\u044f (2007). \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0435\u0437\u0438\u043a. \u0422\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043c, pp. 177\u2013180</ref> and don't consider them to be moods but view them as verbial morphosyntactic constructs or separate [[grameme]]s of the verb class. The possible existence of a few other moods has been discussed in the literature. Most Bulgarian school grammars teach the traditional view of 4 Bulgarian moods (as described above, but excluding the subjunctive and including the inferential).\n\n=====Tense=====\nThere are three grammatically distinctive positions in time \u2013 present, past and future \u2013 which combine with aspect and mood to produce a number of formations. Normally, in grammar books these formations are viewed as separate tenses \u2013 i. e. \"past imperfect\" would mean that the verb is in past tense, in the imperfective aspect, and in the indicative mood (since no other mood is shown). There are more than 40 different tenses across Bulgarian's two aspects and five  moods.\n\nIn the indicative mood, there are three simple tenses:\n*''Present tense'' is a temporally unmarked simple form made up of the verbal stem and a complex suffix composed of the [[thematic vowel]] {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/a/}} and the person/number ending (\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0433\u0430\u043c, ''pri\u02c8stig\u0250m'', \"I arrive/I am arriving\"); only imperfective verbs can stand in the present indicative tense independently;\n*''Past imperfect'' is a simple verb form used to express an action which is contemporaneous or subordinate to other past actions; it is made up of an imperfective or a perfective verbal stem and the person/number ending (\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0445 {{IPA|/pri\u02c8sti\u0261\u0250x/}}, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0445 {{IPA|/pri\u02c8sti\u0261n\u025bx/}}, 'I was arriving');\n*''Past aorist'' is a simple form used to express a temporarily independent, specific past action; it is made up of a perfective or an imperfective verbal stem and the person/number ending (\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0433\u043d\u0430\u0445, {{IPA|/pri\u02c8sti\u0261n\u0250x/}}, 'I arrived', \u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0445, {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283\u025btox/}}, 'I read');\n\nIn the indicative there are also the following compound tenses:\n*''Future tense'' is a compound form made of the particle \u0449\u0435 {{IPA|/\u0283t\u025b/}} and present tense (\u0449\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0430 {{IPA|/\u0283t\u025b \u02c8ut\u0283\u0250/}}, 'I will study'); negation is expressed by the construction \u043d\u044f\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0272am\u0250 d\u0250/}} and present tense (\u043d\u044f\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0430 {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0272am\u0250 d\u0250 \u02c8ut\u0283\u0250/}}, or the old-fashioned form \u043d\u0435 \u0449\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0430, {{IPA|/n\u025b \u0283t\u025b \u02c8ut\u0283\u0250/}} 'I will not study');\n*''Past future tense'' is a compound form used to express an action which was to be completed in the past but was future as regards another past action; it is made up of the past imperfect of the verb \u0449\u0430 {{IPA|/\u0283t\u0264/}} ('will'), the particle \u0434\u0430 {{IPA|/d\u0250/}} ('to') and the present tense of the verb (e.g. \u0449\u044f\u0445 \u0434\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0430, {{IPA|/\u0283t\u02b2ax d\u0250 \u02c8ut\u0283\u0250/}}, 'I was going to study');\n*''Present perfect'' is a compound form used to express an action which was completed in the past but is relevant for or related to the present; it is made up of the present tense of the verb \u0441\u044a\u043c {{IPA|/s\u0264m/}} ('be') and the past participle (e.g. \u0441\u044a\u043c \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b {{IPA|/s\u0264m \u02c8ut\u0283i\u026b/}}, 'I have studied');\n*''Past perfect'' is a compound form used to express an action which was completed in the past and is relative to another past action; it is made up of the past tense of the verb \u0441\u044a\u043c and the past participle (e.g. \u0431\u044f\u0445 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b {{IPA|/b\u02b2ax \u02c8ut\u0283i\u026b/}}, 'I had studied');\n*''Future perfect'' is a compound form used to express an action which is to take place in the future before another future action; it is made up of the future tense of the verb \u0441\u044a\u043c and the past participle (e.g. \u0449\u0435 \u0441\u044a\u043c \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b {{IPA|/\u0283t\u025b s\u0250m \u02c8ut\u0283i\u026b/}}, 'I will have studied');\n*''Past future perfect'' is a compound form used to express a past action which is future with respect to a past action which itself is prior to another past action; it is made up of the past imperfect of \u0449\u0430, the particle \u0434\u0430 the present tense of the verb \u0441\u044a\u043c and the past participle of the verb (e.g. \u0449\u044f\u0445 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u043c \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b, {{IPA|/\u0283t\u02b2ax d\u0250 s\u0250m \u02c8ut\u0283i\u026b/}}, 'I would have studied').\n\nThe four perfect constructions above can vary in aspect depending on the aspect of the main-verb participle; they are in fact pairs of imperfective and perfective aspects. Verbs in forms using past participles also vary in voice and gender.\n\nThere is only one simple tense in the [[imperative mood]], the present, and there are simple forms only for the second-person singular, -\u0438/-\u0439 (-i, -y/i), and plural, -\u0435\u0442\u0435/-\u0439\u0442\u0435 (-ete, -yte), e.g. \u0443\u0447\u0430 {{IPA|/\u02c8ut\u0283\u0250/}} ('to study'): \u0443\u0447'''\u0438''' {{IPA|/o\u02c8t\u0283i/}}, sg., \u0443\u0447'''\u0435\u0442\u0435''' {{IPA|/o\u02c8t\u0283\u025bt\u025b/}}, pl.; \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044f {{IPA|/\u02c8i\u0261raj\u0250/}} 'to play': \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430'''\u0439''' {{IPA|/i\u0261\u02c8raj/}}, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430'''\u0439\u0442\u0435''' {{IPA|/i\u0261\u02c8rajt\u025b/}}. There are compound imperative forms for all persons and numbers in the present compound imperative (\u0434\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435, {{IPA|da i\u0261\u02c8rae/}}), the present perfect compound imperative (\u0434\u0430 \u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b, {{IPA|/d\u0250 \u025b i\u0261\u02c8ra\u026b/}}) and the rarely used present pluperfect compound imperative (\u0434\u0430 \u0435 \u0431\u0438\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b, {{IPA|/d\u0250 \u025b bil i\u0261\u02c8ra\u026b/}}).\n\nThe [[conditional mood]] consists of five compound tenses, most of which are not grammatically distinguishable. The present, future and past conditional use a special past form of the stem \u0431\u0438- (bi \u2013 \"be\") and the past participle (\u0431\u0438\u0445 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b, {{IPA|/bix \u02c8ut\u0283i\u026b/}}, 'I would study'). The past future conditional and the past future perfect conditional coincide in form with the respective indicative tenses.\n\nThe [[subjunctive mood]] is rarely documented as a separate verb form in Bulgarian, (being, morphologically, a sub-instance of the quasi-[[infinitive]] construction with the particle \u0434\u0430 and a normal finite verb form), but nevertheless it is used regularly. The most common form, often mistaken for the present tense, is the present subjunctive ([\u043f\u043e-\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435] \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0438\u0434\u0430 {{IPA|(\u02c8p\u0254dobr\u025b) d\u0250 o\u02c8tid\u0250/}}, 'I had better go'). The difference between the present indicative and the present subjunctive tense is that the subjunctive can be formed by ''both'' perfective and imperfective verbs. It has completely replaced the infinitive and the supine from complex expressions (see below). It is also employed to express opinion about ''possible'' future events. The past perfect subjunctive ([\u043f\u043e-\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435] \u0434\u0430 \u0431\u044f\u0445 \u043e\u0442\u0438\u0448\u044a\u043b {{IPA|(\u02c8p\u0254dobr\u025b) d\u0250 b\u02b2ax o\u02c8ti\u0283\u0250l/}}, 'I'd had better be gone') refers to ''possible'' events in the past, which ''did not'' take place, and the present pluperfect subjunctive (\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u043c \u0431\u0438\u043b \u043e\u0442\u0438\u0448\u044a\u043b {{IPA|/d\u0250 s\u0250m bil o\u02c8ti\u0283\u0250l/}}), which may be used about both past and future events arousing feelings of incontinence, suspicion, etc. and has no perfect to English translation.\n\nThe [[grammatical mood|inferential mood]] has five pure tenses. Two of them are simple \u2013 ''past aorist inferential'' and ''past imperfect inferential'' \u2013 and are formed by the past participles of perfective and imperfective verbs, respectively. There are also three compound tenses \u2013 ''past future inferential'', ''past future perfect inferential'' and ''past perfect inferential''. All these tenses' forms are gender-specific in the singular. There are also conditional and compound-imperative crossovers. The existence of inferential forms has been attributed to Turkic influences by most Bulgarian linguists.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Morphologically, they are derived from the [[Bulgarian language#Tense|perfect]].\n\n====Non-finite verbal forms====\nBulgarian has the following [[participle]]s:\n*''Present active participle'' (\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0448\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435) is formed from imperfective stems with the addition of the suffixes \u2013\u0430\u0449/\u2013\u0435\u0449/\u2013\u044f\u0449 (\u0447\u0435\u0442'''\u044f\u0449''', 'reading') and is used only attributively;\n*''Present passive participle'' (\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0448\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435) is formed by the addition of the suffixes -\u0438\u043c/\u0430\u0435\u043c/\u0443\u0435\u043c (\u0447\u0435\u0442'''\u0438\u043c''', 'that can be read, readable');\n*''Past active aorist participle'' (\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435) is formed by the addition of the suffix \u2013\u043b\u2013 to perfective stems (\u0447\u0435'''\u043b''', '[have] read');\n*''Past active imperfect participle'' (\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435) is formed by the addition of the suffixes \u2013\u0435\u043b/\u2013\u0430\u043b/\u2013\u044f\u043b to imperfective stems (\u0447\u0435\u0442'''\u044f\u043b''', '[have been] reading');\n*''Past passive aorist participle''' (\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435) is formed from aorist/perfective stems with the addition of the suffixes -\u043d/\u2013\u0442 (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u043d''', 'read'; \u0443\u0431\u0438'''\u0442''', 'killed'); it is used predicatively and attributively;\n*''Past passive imperfect participle''' (\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435) is formed from imperfective stems with the addition of the suffix \u2013\u043d (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'''\u043d''', '[been] read'; \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430'''\u043d''', '[been] being killed'); it is used predicatively and attributively;\n*''[[Adverbial participle]]'' (\u0434\u0435\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435) is usually formed from imperfective present stems with the suffix \u2013(\u0435)\u0439\u043a\u0438 (\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0439\u043a\u0438''', 'while reading'), relates an action contemporaneous with and subordinate to the main verb and is originally a Western Bulgarian form.\n\nThe participles are inflected by gender, number, and definiteness, and are coordinated with the subject when forming compound tenses (see tenses above). When used in attributive role the inflection attributes are coordinated with the noun that is being attributed.\n\n====Reflexive verbs====\nBulgarian uses [[reflexive verb]]al forms (i.e. actions which are performed by the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] onto him- or herself) which behave in a similar way as they do in many other Indo-European languages, such as French and Spanish. The reflexive is expressed by the invariable particle '''''se''''',<ref group=note>Unlike in French and Spanish, where ''se'' is only used for the 3rd person, and other particles, such as ''me'' and ''te'', are used for the 1st and 2nd persons singular, e.g. ''je me lave/me lavo'' \u2013 I wash myself.</ref> originally a [[clitic]] form of the accusative reflexive pronoun.

The same pattern is used to form adverbs from the (adjective-like) ordinal numerals, e.g. \u043f\u044a\u0440\u0432\u043e (firstly), \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e (secondly), \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043e (thirdly), and in some cases from (adjective-like) cardinal numerals, e.g. \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e (twice as/double), \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e (three times as), \u043f\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e (five times as).\n\nThe remaining adverbs are formed in ways that are no longer productive in the language. A small number are original (not derived from other words), for example: \u0442\u0443\u043a (here), \u0442\u0430\u043c (there), \u0432\u044a\u0442\u0440\u0435 (inside), \u0432\u044a\u043d (outside), \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e (very/much) etc. The rest are mostly fossilized case forms, such as:\n*archaic locative forms of some adjectives, e.g. \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435 (well), \u0437\u043b\u0435 (badly), \u0442\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0434\u0435 (too, rather), and nouns \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435 (up), \u0443\u0442\u0440\u0435 (tomorrow), \u043b\u0435\u0442\u0435 (in the summer);\n*archaic instrumental forms of some adjectives, e.g. \u0442\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043c (quietly), \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043e\u043c (furtively), \u0441\u043b\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c (blindly), and nouns, e.g. \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043c (during the day), \u043d\u043e\u0449\u0435\u043c (during the night), \u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c (one next to the other), \u0434\u0443\u0445\u043e\u043c (spiritually), \u0446\u0438\u0444\u0440\u043e\u043c (in figures), \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c (with words); or verbs: \u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c (while running), \u043b\u0435\u0436\u0435\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c (while lying), \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c (while standing).\n*archaic accusative forms of some nouns: \u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441 (today), \u043d\u043e\u0449\u0435\u0441 (tonight), \u0441\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d (in the morning), \u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435/\u0437\u0438\u043c\u044a\u0441 (in winter);\n*archaic genitive forms of some nouns: \u0434\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0430 (tonight), \u0441\u043d\u043e\u0449\u0438 (last night), \u0432\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0430 (yesterday);\n*homonymous and etymologically identical to the feminine singular form of the corresponding adjective used with the definite article: \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 (hard), \u0441\u043b\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 (gropingly); the same pattern has been applied to some verbs, e.g. \u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 (while running), \u043b\u0435\u0436\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 (while lying), \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 (while standing).\n*derived from cardinal numerals by means of a non-productive suffix: \u0432\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044a\u0436 (once), \u0434\u0432\u0430\u0436 (twice), \u0442\u0440\u0438\u0436 (thrice);\n\nAdverbs can sometimes be reduplicated to emphasize the qualitative or quantitative properties of actions, moods or relations as performed by the subject of the sentence: \"\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\" (\"rather slowly\"), \"\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0430-\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0430\" (\"with great difficulty\"), \"\u0441\u044a\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c-\u0441\u044a\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c\" (\"quite\", \"thoroughly\").\n\n===Syntax===\nBulgarian employs [[clitic doubling]], mostly for emphatic purposes. For example, the following constructions are common in colloquial Bulgarian:\n\n:\u0410\u0437 (\u0433\u043e) \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044a\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f.\n:(lit. \"I gave ''it'' the present to Maria.\")\n\n:\u0410\u0437 (\u045d \u0433\u043e) \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044a\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f.\n:(lit. \"I gave ''her it'' the present to Maria.\")\n\nThe phenomenon is practically obligatory in the spoken language in the case of inversion signalling information structure (in writing, clitic doubling may be skipped in such instances, with a somewhat bookish effect):\n\n:\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044a\u043a\u0430 (\u045d) \u0433\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0445 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f.\n:(lit. \"The present [''to her''] ''it'' I-gave to Maria.\")\n\n:\u041d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u045d (\u0433\u043e) \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044a\u043a\u0430.\n:(lit. \"To Maria ''to her'' [''it''] I-gave the present.\")\n\nSometimes, the doubling signals syntactic relations, thus:\n\n:\u041f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u0438 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u044f\u0434\u043e\u0445\u0430 \u0432\u044a\u043b\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435.\n:(lit. \"Petar and Ivan ''them'' ate the wolves.\")\n:Transl.: \"Petar and Ivan were eaten by the wolves\".\n\nThis is contrasted with:\n\n:\u041f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u0438 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0438\u0437\u044f\u0434\u043e\u0445\u0430 \u0432\u044a\u043b\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435.\n:(lit. \"Petar and Ivan ate the wolves\")\n:Transl.: \"Petar and Ivan ate the wolves\".\n\nIn this case, clitic doubling can be a colloquial alternative of the more formal or bookish passive voice, which would be constructed as follows:\n:\u041f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u0438 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0431\u044f\u0445\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u044f\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0432\u044a\u043b\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435.\n:(lit. \"Petar and Ivan were eaten by the wolves.\")\n\nClitic doubling is also fully obligatory, both in the spoken and in the written norm, in clauses including several special expressions that use the short accusative and dative pronouns such as \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435 \u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0435 (I feel like playing), \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0438 \u0435 (I am cold), and \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u0435 \u0440\u044a\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 (my arm hurts):\n\n:\u041d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u043d \u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0438, \u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u043c\u0443 \u0441\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435.\n:(lit. \"To me ''to me'' it-feels-like-sleeping, and to Ivan ''to him'' it-feels-like-playing\")\n:Transl.: \"I feel like sleeping, and Ivan feels like playing.\"\n:\u041d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0438 \u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e, \u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0432\u0438 \u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043f\u043b\u043e.\n:(lit. \"To us ''to us'' it-is cold, and to you-plur.

These constructions are all referred to as ''\"na galeno\"'' (lit. \"caressing\" form):\n*''mayka'' (mother) \u2192 ''maychitse''; ''tatko'' (father) \u2192 ''tatentse''\nSuch words can be used ''both'' from parent to child, and vice versa, as can:\n*''batko'' (big brother) \u2192 ''batentse''; ''priyatel'' (friend) \u2192 ''priyatelche''.\n\nPersonal names are shortened:\n*Georgi \u2192 Gosho/Gotse, Mihail \u2192 Misho, Angel \u2192 Gele/Acho, Ivan \u2192 Vanko, Vasil \u2192 Vasko\n*Anna \u2192 Ani, Irina \u2192 Reni\n\nThere is an interesting trend (which is comparatively modern, although it might well have deeper, dormant roots) where the feminine ending \"'''''-ka'''''\" and the definite suffix \"'''''-ta'''''\" (\"the\") are added to male names \u2013 note that this is affectionate and not at all insulting (in fact, the endings are not even really considered as being \"feminine\"):\n*Ivan \u2192 V\u00e0nkata, Acho \u2192 \u00c0chkata.\n\nThe female equivalent would be to add the neuter ending \"'''''-to'''''\" to the diminutive form:\n*Nadia \u2192 Nadeto, Sonia \u2192 Soncheto\n\n'''Augmentative'''\n\nThis is to present words to sound larger \u2013 usually by adding \"'''''-shte'''''\":\n*''chovek'' (person) \u2192 ''chovech'''ishte''''' (huge person) (note the root change ''k\u2192ch'')\nSome words only exist in an augmentative form \u2013 e.g.\n*''zrelishte'' \"(awesome) spectacle\" (from the old Slavic root \"to see\")\n*''svlachishte'' \"landslide\" \u2013 from ''svlicham'' \"to drag down\"\n\n====Conjunctions and particles====\n'''''\"But\"'''''\n\nIn Bulgarian, there are several conjunctions all translating into English as \"but\", which are all used in distinct situations. They are '''''\u043d\u043e''' (no), '''\u0430\u043c\u0430''' (am\u00e0), '''\u0430''' (a), '''\u0430\u043c\u0438''' (am\u00ec)'', and '''''\u0430\u043b\u0430''' (al\u00e0)'' (and '''''\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0435''' (obache)'' \u2013 \"however\", identical in use to ''\u043d\u043e'').\n\nWhile there is some overlapping between their uses, in many cases they are specific. For example, '''''ami''''' is used for a choice \u2013 ''ne tova, ami onova'' \u2013 \"not this one, but that one\" (comp. Spanish ''sino''), while '''''ama''''' is often used to provide extra information or an opinion \u2013 ''kazah go, ama sgreshih'' \u2013 \"I said it, but I was wrong\". Meanwhile, '''''a''''' provides contrast between two situations, and in some sentences can even be translated as \"although\", \"while\" or even \"and\" \u2013 ''az rabotya, a toy blee'' \u2013 \"I'm working, and he's daydreaming\".\n\nVery often, different words can be used to alter the emphasis of a sentence \u2013 e.g. while ''\"pusha, no ne tryabva\"'' and ''\"pusha, a ne tryabva\"'' both mean \"I smoke, but I shouldn't\", the first sounds more like a statement of fact (\"...but I mustn't\"), while the second feels more like a ''judgement'' (\"...but I oughtn't\"). Similarly, ''az ne iskam, ama toy iska'' and ''az ne iskam, a toy iska'' both mean \"I don't want to, but he does\", however the first emphasises the fact that ''he'' wants to, while the second emphasises the ''wanting'' rather than the person.\n\n''Ala'' is interesting in that, while it feels archaic, it is often used in poetry and frequently in children's stories, since it has quite a moral/ominous feel to it.\n\nSome common expressions use these words, and some can be used alone as interjections:\n*''da, ama ne'' (lit. \"yes, but no\") \u2013 means \"you're wrong to think so\".\n*''ama'' can be tagged onto a sentence to express surprise: ''ama toy spi!'' \u2013 \"he's sleeping!\"\n*''\u0430\u043c\u0438!'' \u2013 \"you don't say!\", \"really!\"\n\n''' Vocative particles '''\n\nBulgarian has several abstract particles which are used to strengthen a statement. These have no precise translation in English.<ref group=note>Perhaps most similar in use is the tag \"man\", but the Bulgarian particles are more abstract still.</ref> The particles are strictly informal and can even be considered rude by some people and in some situations. They are mostly used at the end of questions or instructions.\n*''\u0431\u0435 (be)'' \u2013 the most common particle. It can be used to strengthen a statement or, sometimes, to indicate derision of an opinion, aided by the tone of voice. (Originally purely masculine, it can now be used towards both men and women.)\n**''kazhi mi, be'' \u2013 tell me (insistence); ''taka li, be?'' \u2013 is that so? (derisive); ''vyarno li, be?'' \u2013 you don't say!.\n*''\u0434\u0435 (de)'' \u2013 expresses urgency, sometimes pleading.\n**''stavay, de!'' \u2013 come on, get up!\n*''\u043c\u0430 (ma)'' (feminine only) \u2013 originally simply the feminine counterpart of ''be'', but today perceived as rude and derisive (compare the similar evolution of the vocative forms of feminine names).\n*''\u0431\u0440\u0435 (bre, masculine)'', ''\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0438 (mari, feminine)'' \u2013 similar to ''be'' and ''ma'', but archaic. Although informal, can sometimes be heard being used by older people.\n\n'''Modal Particles'''\n\nThese are \"tagged\" on to the beginning or end of a sentence to express the mood of the speaker in relation to the situation. They are mostly [[interrogative]] or slightly [[imperative mood|imperative]] in nature. There is no change in the grammatical mood when these are used (although they may be expressed through different grammatical moods in other languages).\n*''\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438 (nal\u00ec)'' \u2013 is a universal affirmative tag, like \"isn't it\"/\"won't you\", etc. (it is invariable, like the French ''n'est-ce pas''). It can be placed almost anywhere in the sentence, and does not always require a verb:\n**''shte doydesh, nali?'' \u2013 you are coming, aren't you?; ''nali iskaha?'' \u2013 didn't they want to?; ''nali onzi?'' \u2013 that one, right?;\n**it can express quite complex thoughts through simple constructions \u2013 ''nali nyamashe?'' \u2013 \"I thought you weren't going to!\" or \"I thought there weren't any!\" (depending on context \u2013 the verb ''nyama'' presents general negation/lacking, see \"nyama\", above).\n*''\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 (dal\u00ec)'' \u2013 expresses uncertainty (if in the middle of a clause, can be translated as \"whether\") \u2013 e.g. ''dali shte doyde?'' \u2013 \"do you think he will come?\"\n*''\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430 (nim\u00e0)'' \u2013 presents disbelief ~\"don't tell me that...\" \u2013 e.g. ''nima iskash?!'' \u2013 \"don't tell me you want to!\". It is slightly archaic, but still in use. Can be used on its own as an [[interjection]] \u2013 ''nima!''\n*''\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e (dan\u00f2)'' \u2013 expresses hope \u2013 ''shte doyde'' \u2013 \"he will come\"; ''dano doyde'' \u2013 \"I hope he comes\" (comp. Spanish ''ojal\u00e1''). Grammatically, ''dano'' is entirely separate from the verb ''nadyavam se'' \u2013 \"to hope\".\n*''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430 (n\u00e8ka)'' \u2013 means \"let('s)\" \u2013 e.g. ''neka doyde'' \u2013 \"let him come\"; when used in the first person, it expresses extreme politeness: ''neka da otidem...'' \u2013 \"let us go\" (in colloquial situations, ''hayde'', below, is used instead).\n**''neka'', as an interjection, can also be used to express judgement or even ''[[Schadenfreude]]'' \u2013 ''neka mu!'' \u2013 \"he deserves it!\".\n\n''' Intentional particles '''\n\nThese express intent or desire, perhaps even pleading. They can be seen as a sort of [[cohortative mood|cohortative]] side to the language. (Since they can be used by themselves, they could even be considered as verbs in their own right.) They are also highly informal.\n*''\u0445\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435 (h\u00e0ide)'' \u2013 \"come on\", \"let's\"\n**e.g. ''hayde, po-barzo'' \u2013 \"faster!\"\n*''\u044f (ya)'' \u2013 \"let me\" \u2013 exclusively when asking someone else for something. It can even be used on its own as a request or instruction (depending on the tone used), indicating that the speaker wants to partake in or try whatever the listener is doing.\n**''ya da vidya'' \u2013 let me see; ''ya?'' or ''ya!'' \u2013 \"let me.../give me...\"\n*''\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0439 (ned\u00e8i)'' (plur. ''ned\u00e8yte'') \u2013 can be used to issue a negative instruction \u2013 e.g. ''nedey da idvash'' \u2013 \"don't come\" (''nedey'' + subjunctive). In some dialects, the construction ''nedey idva'' (''nedey'' + preterite) is used instead. As an interjection \u2013 ''nedei!'' \u2013 \"don't!\" (See section on [[Bulgarian grammar#Mood|imperative mood]]).\n\nThese particles can be combined with the vocative particles for greater effect, e.g. ''ya da vidya, be'' (let me see), or even exclusively in combinations with them, with no other elements, e.g. ''hayde, de!'' (come on!); ''nedey, de!'' (I told you not to!).\n\n====Pronouns of quality====\nBulgarian has several pronouns of quality which have no direct parallels in English \u2013 ''kakav'' (what sort of); ''takuv'' (this sort of); ''onakuv'' (that sort of \u2013 colloq.); ''nyakakav'' (some sort of); ''nikakav'' (no sort of); ''vsyakakav'' (every sort of); and the relative pronoun ''kakavto'' (the sort of ... that ... ). The adjective ''ednakuv'' (\"the same\") derives from the same radical.<ref group=note>Like the [[demonstrative pronoun|demonstratives]], these take the same form as pronouns as they do as adjectives \u2013 ie. ''takuv'' means both \"this kind of...\" (adj.) and ''this kind of person/thing'' (pron., depending on the context).</ref>\n\nExample phrases include:\n*''kakav chovek?!'' \u2013 \"what person?!\"; ''kakav chovek e toy?'' \u2013 what sort of person is he?\n*''ne poznavam takuv'' \u2013 \"I don't know any (people like that)\" (lit. \"I don't know this sort of (person)\")\n*''nyakakvi hora'' \u2013 lit. \"some type of people\", but the understood meaning is \"a bunch of people I don't know\"\n*''vsyakakvi hora'' \u2013 \"all sorts of people\"\n*''kakav iskash?'' \u2013 \"which type do you want?\"; ''nikakav!'' \u2013 \"I don't want any!\"/\"none!\"\n\nAn interesting phenomenon is that these can be strung along one after another in quite long constructions, e.g.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!word\n!literal meaning\n!sentence\n!meaning of sentence as a whole\n|-\n|\u2013\n|\u2013\n|edna kola\n|a car\n|-\n|takava\n|this sort of\n|edna '''takava''' kola ... \n|this car '''(that I'm trying to describe)'''\n|-\n|nikakva\n|no sort of\n|edna takava '''nikakva''' kola\n|this '''worthless''' car (that I'm trying to describe)\n|-\n|nyakakva\n|some sort of\n|edna takava '''nyakakva''' nikakva kola\n|this '''sort of''' worthless car (that I'm trying to describe)\n|}\nAn extreme (colloquial) sentence, with almost no ''physical'' meaning in it whatsoever \u2013 yet which ''does'' have perfect meaning to the Bulgarian ear \u2013 would be :\n*\"kakva e taya takava edna nyakakva nikakva?!\"\n*inferred translation \u2013 \"what kind of no-good person is she?\"\n*literal translation: \"what kind of \u2013 is \u2013 this one here (she) \u2013 this sort of \u2013 one \u2013 some sort of \u2013 no sort of\"\n\u2014Note: the subject of the sentence is simply the pronoun \"taya\" (lit. \"this one here\"; colloq. \"she\").\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon that is observed in colloquial speech is the use of ''takova'' (neuter of ''takyv'') not only as a substitute for an adjective, but also as a substitute for a verb. In that case the base form ''takova'' is used as the third person singular in the present indicative and all other forms are formed by analogy to other verbs in the language. Sometimes the \"verb\" may even acquire a derivational prefix that changes its meaning. Examples:\n* ''takovah ti shapkata'' \u2013 I did something to your hat (perhaps: I took your hat)\n* ''takovah si ochilata'' \u2013 I did something to my glasses (perhaps: I lost my glasses)\n* ''takovah se'' \u2013 I did something to myself (perhaps: I hurt myself)\nAnother use of ''takova'' in colloquial speech is the word ''takovata'', which can be used as a substitution for a noun, but also, if the speaker doesn't remember or is not sure how to say something, they might say ''takovata'' and then pause to think about it:\n* ''i posle toy takovata...'' \u2013 and then he [no translation] ... \n* ''izyadoh ti takovata'' \u2013 I ate something of yours (perhaps: I ate your dessert). Here the word ''takovata'' is used as a substitution for a noun.\nSimilar \"meaningless\" expressions are extremely common in spoken Bulgarian, especially when the speaker is finding it difficult to describe something.\n\n====Inflection and derivation====\nBulgarian has a rich set of inflectional and derivational processes.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In the simplest terms, this can be seen in the way that most nouns and verbs are formed \u2013 namely by adding prefixes and suffixes to a rather limited number of roots, which creates almost a dozen new words, along with a couple of dozen derivatives thereof. Here are some examples using the root word ''klyuch'' (\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447) \"key/switch\":\n\nNouns:\n:{|style=\"border=\"0\"\n|-\n|width=120px |\n|width=200px |\n|-\n|''klyuch''\n|a key\n|-\n|''klyuch\u2013at''\n|the key\n|-\n|''klyuch\u2013alka''\n|a lock\n|-\n|''klyuch\u2013ar''\n|a locksmith\n|-\n|''klyuch\u2013ar\u2013i\u2013te''\n|the locksmiths\n|}\nAdjectives:\n:{|style=\"border=\"0\"\n|-\n|width=120px |\n|width=200px |\n|-\n|''klyuch\u2013ar\u2013ski''\n|of a locksmith\n|-\n|''klyuch\u2013ar\u2013ski\u2013yat''\n|of a locksmith (definite form)\n|-\n|''klyuch\u2013ov''\n|key (e.g. \"a key point\")\n|-\n|''v\u2013klyuch\u2013en''\n|switched on\n|}\nVerbs:\n:{|style=\"border=\"0\"\n|-\n|width=120px |\n|width=200px |\n|-\n|''v\u2013klyuch-a''\n|to switch on\n|-\n|''pre\u2013v\u2013klyuch-a''\n|to switch over (e.g. TV channel)\n|-\n|''iz\u2013klyuch-a''\n|to switch off\n|-\n|''ot\u2013klyuch-a''\n|to unlock\n|-\n|''za\u2013klyuch-a''\n|to lock\n|-\n|''pri\u2013klyuch-a''\n|to complete\n|}\nAn extreme example using this root might be:\n:''pre\u2013v\u2013klyuch\u2013en\u2013i\u2013te'' \u2014 the ones that have been switched over (\"\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\")<ref>[http://www.dnevnik.bg/print/arhiv_pari/2000/07/01/1498773_opel_predizvikva_konkurentite_si_na_pazara/ Opel are challenging their market competition] ''(in Bulgarian)'' [[Dnevnik (Bulgaria)|Dnevnik]], 1 July 2000.

For example, the ''bol\u2013'' root, which has to do with ailments (''bol-ka'' \u2013 pain; ''bol-est'' \u2013 illness; ''bol-i'' \u2013 it hurts, etc.), can be used to express various different stages of falling ill:\n\n:{|style=\"border=\"0\"\n|-\n|width=150px |\n|width=100px |\n|-\n|''raz\u2013bol-yahme se''\n|we fell ill\n|-\n|''po\u2013raz\u2013bol-yahme se''\n|we fell slightly ill\n|-\n|''iz\u2013po\u2013raz\u2013bol-yahme se''\n|we all fell very ill\n|}\n\nSimilarly, the root kri\u2013, referring to hiding/discovery:\n\n:{|style=\"border=\"0\"\n|-\n|width=120px |\n|width=150px |\n|-\n|''raz\u2013kri-ha se''\n|they showed themselves\n|-\n|''s\u2013kri-ha se''\n|they hid\n|-\n|''iz\u2013po\u2013kri-ha se''\n|they hid all over the place\n|}\n\n====Miscellaneous====\n*The commonly cited phenomenon of Bulgarian people shaking their head for \"yes\" and nodding for \"no\" is true but, with the influence of Western culture, ever rarer, and almost non-existent among the younger generation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} (It should be noted, however, that the shaking and nodding are ''not'' identical to the Western gestures. The \"nod\" for ''no'' is actually an ''upward'' movement of the head rather than a downward one, while the shaking of the head for ''yes'' is not completely horizontal, but also has a slight \"wavy\" aspect to it.)\n**A [[dental click]] {{IPA|[\u01c0]}} (similar to the English \"tsk\") also means \"no\" (informal), as does ''\u044a-\u044a'' {{IPA|[\u0294\u0259\u0294\u0259]}} (the only occurrence in Bulgarian of the [[glottal stop]]). The two are often said with the upward 'nod'.\n*Bulgarian has an extensive vocabulary covering [[Kinship terminology|family relationships]]. The biggest range of words is for uncles and aunts, e.g. ''chicho'' (your father's brother), ''vuicho'' (your mother's brother), svako (your aunt's husband); an even larger number of synonyms for these three exists in the various dialects of Bulgarian, including ''kaleko, lelincho, tetin'', etc. The words do not only refer to the closest members of the family (such as ''brat'' \u2013 brother, but ''batko''/''bate'' \u2013 older brother, ''sestra'' \u2013 sister, but ''kaka'' \u2013 older sister), but extend to its furthest reaches, e.g. ''badzhanak'' from [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''bacanak'' (the relationship of the husbands of two sisters to each other) and ''etarva'' (the relationships of two brothers' wives to each other). For all in-laws, there are specific names, e.g. a woman's husband's brother is her ''dever'' and her husband's sister is her ''zalva''. In the traditional rural extended family before 1900, there existed separate subcategories for different brothers-in-law/sisters-in-law of a woman with regard to their age relative to hers, e.g. instead of simply a ''dever'' there could be a ''braino'' (older), a ''draginko'' (younger), or an ''ubavenkyo'' (who is still a child).\n*As with many Slavic languages, the [[double negative]] in Bulgarian is grammatically correct, while some forms of it, when used instead of a single negative form, are grammatically incorrect. The following are literal translations of grammatically correct Bulgarian sentences that utilize a double or multiple negation: \"\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u044a\u0434\u0435 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u0449\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b.\" (multiple negation without the use of a compound double negative form, i.e. using a listing of several successive single negation words) \u2013 \"Nobody never nowhere nothing did not do.\" (translated as \"nobody has ever done anything, anywhere\"); \"\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u044a\u043c \u0431\u0438\u043b \u0442\u0430\u043c.\" (double negation without the use of a compound double negative form, i.e. using a listing of several successive single negation words) \u2013 I never did not go there (\"[I] have never been there\"); \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0438 \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u044a\u043c \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b! \u2013 I never no feelings had not have!  (I have never had any feelings!). The same applies for Macedonian.\n\n==Lexis==\n{{Main|Bulgarian lexis}}\n\nMost of the vocabulary  of modern Bulgarian consists of terms inheried from Proto-Slavic and local Bulgarian innovations and formations of those through the mediation of [[Old Bulgarian|Old]] and [[Middle Bulgarian]]. Thus, the native lexical terms in Bulgarian account for 70% to 80% of the lexicon.\n\nThe remaining 25% to 30% are loanwords from a number of languages, as well as derivations of such words. Bulgarian adopted also a few words of [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Bulgar language|Bulgar]] origin. The languages which have contributed most to Bulgarian are [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]] and to a lesser extent [[English language|English]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. Also [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] are the source of many words, used mostly in international terminology. Many Latin terms entered the language through Romanian, Aromanian, and Megleno-Romanian during Bulgarian Empires (present-day Bulgaria was part of Roman Empire), loanwords of Greek origin in Bulgarian are a product of the influence of the liturgical language of the Orthodox Church. Many of the numerous loanwords from another Turkic language, [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] (and, via Ottoman Turkish, from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]) which were adopted into Bulgarian during the long period of [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] rule, have been replaced with native terms. In addition, both specialized (usually coming from the field of [[science]]) and commonplace [[English language|English]] words (notably abstract, commodity/service-related or technical terms) have also penetrated Bulgarian since the second half of the 20th century, especially since 1989. A noteworthy portion of this English-derived terminology has attained some unique features in the process of its introduction to native speakers, and this has resulted in peculiar derivations that set the newly formed loanwords apart from the original words (mainly in pronunciation), although many loanwords are completely identical to the source words. A growing number of international neologisms are also being widely adopted, causing controversy between younger generations who, in general, are raised in the era of digital [[globalization]], and the older, more conservative educated [[Linguistic purism|purists]]. Prior to standardization in the 19th century, after a period of [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] as a [[lingua franca]]  for about 5 centuries,  vernacular Bulgarian is estimated to have been consisted of 50% Ottoman vocabulary, which contained predominantly (up to 80%) Arabic and Persian words.<ref name=\"Bertold Spuler p 69\">Bertold Spuler.

The adoption of Church Slavonic morphology and vocabulary was used to enrich other Slavic languages. It is especially pronounced in Russian, which today consists of mixed native and Church Slavonic (South Slavic) vocabulary, analogically to the Romance vocabulary of English, but in Russian the Church Slavonisms are not perceived as foreign due to their Slavic roots.<ref>{{cite book|title=Die slavischen Sprachen / The Slavic Languages.

An ''n''-gonal bipyramid has 2''n'' [[triangle]] faces, 3''n'' edges, and 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n'' vertices.\n\nThe referenced ''n''-gon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but an internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves.\n\n==Right, oblique and concave bipyramids==\nA '''right bipyramid''' has two points above and below the [[centroid]] of its base. Nonright bipyramids are called '''oblique bipyramids'''. A '''regular bipyramid''' has a [[regular polygon]] internal face and is usually implied to be a ''right bipyramid''.

An escaped big cat would not be reported to the authorities due to the illegality of owning and importing the animals. It has been claimed that animal trainer [[Mary Chipperfield]] released three [[puma (genus)|puma]]s into the wild following the closure of her [[Plymouth]] zoo in 1978, and that subsequent sightings of the animals gave rise to rumours of the Beast.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/21/beast-of-bodmin-mystery-solved-as-dartmoor-zoo-released-pumas-in/ Beast of Dartmoor mystery solved after famous circus owner Mary Chipperfield 'set three Pumas free in 1970s'], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 21 July 2016</ref>\n\nThe [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] conducted an official investigation in 1995.

Measuring about {{convert|4|in|cm}} long by {{convert|7|in|cm}} wide, the skull was lacking its lower jaw but possessed two sharp, prominent canines that suggested that it might have been a leopard. The story hit the national press at about the same time of the official denial of alien big cat evidence on Bodmin Moor.\n\nThe skull was sent to the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[London]] for verification. They determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard, but also found that the cat had not died in Britain and that the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug. The back of the skull was cleanly cut off in a way that is commonly used to mount the head on a rug. There was an egg case inside the skull that had been laid by a tropical cockroach that could not possibly be found in Britain. There were also cut marks on the skull indicating the flesh had been scraped off with a knife, and the skull had begun to decompose only after a recent immersion in water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/mammals/beast-of-bodmin-moor/bm_01.htm |title=The Beast of Bodmin Moor |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Natural History Museum |publisher= |access-date= |quote=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407053236/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/mammals/beast-of-bodmin-moor/bm_01.htm|archivedate=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Beast of Buchan]]\n*[[British big cats]]\n*[[Cryptozoology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090316001418/http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/4-25-2006-94400.asp Cryptozoology and the Beast of Bodmin Moor]\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/content/articles/2008/01/31/possible_big_cat_kill_feature.shtml Photographic evidence of possible big cat in Gloucestershire]\n\n{{Culture of Cornwall}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beast Of Bodmin}}\n[[Category:Bodmin]]\n[[Category:Carnivorous cryptids]]\n[[Category:Cornish folklore]]\n[[Category:Cornish legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:English legendary creatures]]", "sha1": "figy627borh2uh3puntkxgpo9wmilx0"}}, {"title": "Brown University", "ns": "0", "id": "4157", "revision": {"id": "866144777", "parentid": "866141339", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T15:32:55Z", "contributor": {"username": "DMacks", "id": "712163"}, "comment": "remove circular redir, and other linkfixes and reffixes", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the Ivy League university in Rhode Island|the university in Arkansas|John Brown University}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2014}}\n{{Infobox university\n| name = Brown University\n| image_name = Brown University coat of arms.svg\n| image_size = 130\n| latin_name = Universitas Brunensis\n| motto = ''In Deo Speramus'' ([[Latin]])\n| mottoeng = In God We Hope<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/factsandfigures.html|title=Brown University Admission Facts and Figures |publisher=Brown University|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref>\n| established = 1764\n|former_names = Rhode Island College (1764-1804)\n| type = [[Private university|Private]]\n| academic_affiliations = {{unbulleted list|[[Association of American Universities|AAU]]|[[Universities Research Association|URA]]|[[National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities|NAICU]]|[[568 Group]]}}\n| endowment = [[US$]]3.8 billion<ref>As of October 2, 2018. {{cite web |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/money/browns-endowment-posts-132-25-gain-best-in-ivy-league-so-far/ar-BBNPTBW |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=October 2, 2018 |title=Brown's Endowment Posts 13.2% Gain, Best in Ivy League So Far}}</ref> (2018)\n| president = [[Christina Paxson]]\n| provost = [[Richard M.

That for this End ... it will be necessary ... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the boarding of the youth & the Residence of the Professors.</blockquote>\n\nThe three petitioners were [[Ezra Stiles]], pastor of Newport's [[Clarke Street Meeting House|Second Congregational Church]] and future president of [[Yale University|Yale]]; [[William Ellery|William Ellery, Jr.]], future [[Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence|signer]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]; and [[Josias Lyndon]], future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery were co-authors of the Charter of the College two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, \"This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University.\"<ref>[[#Dexter|Dexter (1916)]], p. 25.</ref>\n\nThere is further documentary evidence that Stiles was making plans for a college in 1762. On January 20, Chauncey Whittelsey, pastor of the First Church of New Haven, answered a letter from Stiles:<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The week before last I sent you the Copy of Yale College Charter ... Should you make any Progress in the Affair of a Colledge, I should be glad to hear of it; I heartily wish you Success therein.</blockquote>\n\nThe Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches also had an eye on Rhode Island, home of the mother church of their denomination: the [[First Baptist Church in America]], founded in Providence in 1638 by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. The Baptists were as yet unrepresented among colonial colleges; the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]] had [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]], the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] had the College of New Jersey (later [[Princeton University|Princeton]]), and the [[Church of England|Episcopalians]] had the [[College of William and Mary]] and King's College (later [[Columbia University|Columbia]]). Isaac Backus was the historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural Trustee of Brown, writing in 1784. He described the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:<ref>Isaac Backus, ''A History of New-England'', 3 vols. (Boston, 1777\u201396), vol. 2, quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], who took his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.</blockquote>\n\nManning arrived at [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the Charter for the College. Stiles's first draft was read to the [[Rhode Island General Assembly|General Assembly]] in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried that the College Board of Fellows would under-represent the Baptists. A revised Charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Assembly on March 3, 1764.\n\nIn September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the College Corporation was held at Newport. Governor [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] was chosen chancellor, former and future governor [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]] was vice chancellor, [[John Tillinghast]] treasurer, and [[Thomas Eyres]] secretary. The Charter stipulated that the Board of Trustees be composed of 22 Baptists, five [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists\u2014including the College president\u2014\"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations.\"<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 502\u2013503; the Charter and its drafts and associated documents are printed in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 493\u2013507; and in [[#Guild|Guild (1867)]], pp. 119\u2013146.</ref>\n\nThe Charter was not the grant of [[King George III]], as is sometimes supposed, but rather an Act of the colonial General Assembly. In two particulars, the Charter may be said to be a uniquely progressive document. First, other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's Charter asserted, \"Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction.\" Second, according to Brown University historian Walter Bronson, \"the instrument governing Brown University recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other the principle of denominational cooperation.\"<ref name=\"Bronson, pp. 29-33\"/> The oft-repeated statement is inaccurate that Brown's Charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership; other college charters were also liberal in that particular.\n\n[[File:Brown University 1792 engraving.jpg|thumb|right|[[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] (right) and president's house, engraving 1792]]\n[[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]] was sworn in as the College's first president in 1765 and served until 1791. In 1770, the College moved from [[Warren, Rhode Island]] to the crest of [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|College Hill]] overlooking Providence. [[Solomon Drowne]], a freshman in the class of 1773, wrote in his diary on March 26, 1770:<ref>Quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This day the Committee for settling the spot for the College, met at the New-Brick School House, when it was determined it should be set on ye Hill opposite Mr. John Jenkes; up the Presbyterian Lane.</blockquote>\n\nPresbyterian Lane is the present College Street.

In fact, Brown University was named for Nicholas Brown, Jr.\u2014philanthropist, founder of the [[Providence Athenaeum]], co-founder of [[Butler Hospital]], and an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]].

It is generally regarded as the world's leading collection of primary historical sources pertaining to the Americas before 1825. It houses a very large percentage of the titles published before that date about the discovery, settlement, history, and natural history of the New World. The \"JCB\", as it is known, published the 29-volume ''Bibliotheca Americana'', a principal bibliography in the field. Typical of its noteworthy holdings is the best preserved of the eleven surviving copies of the [[Bay Psalm Book]] the earliest extant book printed in British North America and the most expensive printed book in the world.<ref>BBC News, \"Bay Psalm Book is most expensive printed work at $14.2m,\" [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-25115524 BBC]; [http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2013/the-bay-psalm-book-sale-n09039/The-Bay-Psalm-Book/2013/10/census-of-copies-of-.html Sothebys.com]</ref> There is also a very fine Shakespeare [[First Folio]], added to the collection by John Carter Brown's widow (a Shakespeare enthusiast) on the grounds that it includes ''[[The Tempest]]'', a play set in the New World. The JCB holdings comprise more than 50,000 early titles and about 16,000 modern books, as well as prints, manuscripts, maps, and other items in the library's specialty.

Its one million artifacts, available for research and educational purposes, are located at its Collections Research Center in Bristol, RI.  The museum's goal is to inspire creative and critical thinking about culture by fostering interdisciplinary understanding of the material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students to work with collections and the public, teaching through objects and programs in classrooms and exhibitions. The museum sponsors lectures and events in all areas of anthropology, and also runs an extensive program of outreach to local schools.\n\n[[File:First Baptist Meetinghouse, Providence, RI.jpg|thumb|left|263x263px|Brown Commencements have been held since 1776 in the [[First Baptist Church in America]], built 1774-75, designed by [[Joseph Brown (astronomer)|Joseph Brown]].

It is a succession of green spaces extending from Ruth Simmons Quadrangle (Lincoln Field) in the south to the Pembroke College monument on Meeting Street in the north.  It is bordered by departmental buildings and the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. A focal point of The Walk will be the [[Maya Lin]]-designed water-circulating topographical sculpture of Narragansett Bay, to be installed in 2014 next to the Institute for the Study of Environment and Society.\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-SmithBuonannoHall.jpg|thumb|right|201x201px|Smith-Buonanno Hall on the Pembroke Campus]]\n[[File:Miller Hall (Brown University, Providence, RI, USA).jpg|thumb|right|293x293px|Miller Hall on the Pembroke Campus]]\n\n===Pembroke campus===\nThe [[Pembroke College in Brown University|Women's College in Brown University]], known as Pembroke College, was founded in October 1891. When it merged with Brown in 1971, the Pembroke Campus was absorbed into the Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is centered on a quadrangle that fronts on Meeting Street, where a garden and monument\u2014with scale-model of the quadrangle in bronze\u2014compose the formal entry to the campus. The Pembroke campus is among the most pleasing spaces at Brown, with noteworthy examples of Victorian and Georgian architecture. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907, formerly Pembroke Gymnasium), and Metcalf Hall (1919); the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910); the quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947) and its terrace and garden. Pembroke Hall, originally a classroom building and library, now houses the Cogut Center for the Humanities.\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-OrwigMusicBuilding.jpg|thumb|left|253x253px|The Orwig Music Library in the former Isaac Gifford Ladd house, built 1850, acquired in 1969 when Brown bought the buildings and grounds of [[Bryant University]] on the southeast edge of the Brown campus]]\nEast Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, was originally the site of [[Bryant University]]. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to move to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown bought their Providence campus for $5 million. This expanded the Brown campus by {{convert|10|acre|m2}} and 26 buildings, included several historic houses, notably the Isaac Gifford Ladd house, built 1850 (now Brown's Orwig Music Library), and the Robert Taft House, built 1895 (now King House). The area was named East Campus in 1971.\n\n[[Thayer Street]] runs through Brown's main campus, north to south, and is College Hill's reduced-scale counterpart to [[Harvard Square]] or Berkeley's [[Telegraph Avenue]]. Restaurants, cafes, bistros, tavernas, pubs, bookstores, second-hand shops, and the like abound. Tourists, people-watchers, buskers, and students from Providence's six colleges make the scene. Half a mile south of campus is Thayer Street's hipper cousin, [[Wickenden Street]]. More picturesque and with older architecture, it features galleries, pubs, specialty shops, artist-supply stores, and a regionally famous coffee shop that doubles as a film set (for [[Woody Allen]] and others).\n\n[[Brown Stadium]], built in 1925 and home to the football team, is located approximately a mile to the northeast of the main campus.  Marston Boathouse, the home of the crew teams, lies on the Blackstone/Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School is situated in the historic [[Jewelry District (Providence)|Jewelry District of Providence]], near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, [[Rhode Island Hospital]], [[Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island|Women and Infants Hospital]], and Hasbro Children's Hospital. Other University research facilities in the Jewelry District include the Laboratories for Molecular Medicine.\n\nBrown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building overlooking Memorial Park on the Providence Riverwalk. Brown also owns {{convert|376|acre|km2|adj=on}} the [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope Grant]] in Bristol, Rhode Island, an important [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[King Philip's War]] site.

Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown/RISD joint committee.\n\nAdmitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies curriculum, while taking up to three Brown classes. The second year is spent in residence at Brown, during which students take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD major requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can elect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution is determined by the requirements of each student's unique combination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual \"BRDD Exhibition\" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the wider world of industry, design, the media, and the fine arts.\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-LymanHall.jpg|thumb|left|221x221px|Lyman Hall, built 1890-92, designed by [[Stone, Carpenter & Willson|Stone, Carpenter and Willson]] in [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style, houses the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies]]\n\n===Theatre and playwriting===\n\nBrown's theatre and playwriting programs are among the best-regarded in the country.

Three Brown undergraduate concentrations (majors) are hosted by the Watson Institute\u2014Development Studies, International Relations, and Public Policy.  Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Public Policy Program (M.P.A).  The Institute also offers Post Doctoral, professional development and global outreach programming.  In support of these programs, the Institute houses various centers, including the Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies center, The Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its [[Casualties of the Iraq War|Costs of War Project]], first released in 2011 and continuously updated. The Project comprises a team of economists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan since 2001.\n\n[[File:Slater_Hall,_Brown_University.jpg|thumb|left|240px|upright|Slater Hall, built 1879, designed by [[Stone, Carpenter & Willson|Stone and Carpenter]] in [[High Victorian Gothic|Ruskinian Gothic]] style.

In 1916, the departments of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering were merged into a Division of Engineering, and in 2010 the division was elevated to a School of Engineering.\n\nEngineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The School is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools, and follows a model of connectivity between disciplines\u2014including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities and the social sciences. The School practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which engineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of ideas.\n\n===IE Brown Executive MBA Dual Degree Program===\nSince 2009, Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading Business Schools in Europe; [[IE Business School]] in Madrid.

There are 11 residential Greek houses: six fraternities (Beta Rho Pi, [[Delta Phi]], Delta Tau, [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Sigma Chi]], and [[Theta Delta Chi]]; three sororities ([[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], and [[Kappa Delta]]), one co-ed house ([[Zeta Delta Xi]]), and one co-ed literary society ([[Alpha Delta Phi#The Society|Alpha Delta Phi]]).

They are overseen by the Greek Council.\n\nAn alternative to Greek-letter organizations are the program houses organized by themes. As with Greek houses, the residents of program houses select their new members, usually at the start of the spring semester. Examples of program houses are [[St. Anthony Hall]] (located in King House), Buxton International House, the Machado [[French language|French]]/[[Hispanic]]/Latinx House, Technology House, Harambee (African culture) House, Social Action House and [[Interfaith]] House.\n\nCurrently,{{When|date=May 2017}} there are three student cooperative houses at Brown. Two of them, Watermyn and Finlandia on Waterman Street, are owned by the [[Brown Association for Cooperative Housing]] (BACH), a non-profit corporation owned by its members. The third co-op, West House, is located in a Brown-owned house on Brown Street. The three organizations run a vegetarian co-op for the larger community.\n\nAll students not in program housing enter a lottery for general housing. Students form groups and are assigned time slots during which they can pick among the remaining housing options.\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-OrganRecital.jpg|thumb|left|280px|The largest surviving Hutchings-Votey organ in the world is in Sayles Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.brown.edu/articles/2009/03/organ-0|title=The sound of 3,355 pipes - Today at Brown|publisher=Brown University|access-date=October 8, 2014}}</ref> It has 3,355 pipes and weighs 25 tons. It is pictured here for Brown's traditional Halloween midnight concert.]]\n\n=== Societies and clubs ===\n\nThe earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate. The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of [[Solomon Drowne]], class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771. It seems to have disappeared during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. We next hear of the Misokosmian Society, founded in 1794 and renamed the Philermenian Society in 1798. This was effectively a secret society with membership limited to 45. It met fortnightly to hear speeches and debate and thrived until the Civil War; in 1821 its library held 1594 volumes. In 1799, a chapter of the Philandrian Society, also secret, was established at the College. In 1806, the United Brothers was formed as an egalitarian alternative to the Philermenian Society. \"These two great rivals,\" says the University historian, \"divided the student body between them for many years, surviving into the days of President Sears. A tincture of political controversy sharpened their rivalry, the older society inclining to the aristocratic Federals, the younger to the Republicans, the democrats of that day. ... The students continuing to increase in number, they outran the constitutional limits of both societies, and a third, the Franklin Society, was established in 1824; it never had the vitality of the other two, however, and died after ten years.\"<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 181.</ref> Other nineteenth century clubs and societies, too numerous to treat here, are described in Bronson's history of the University.<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 120, 147\u2013148, 180\u2013182, 239\u2013244, 348\u2013349 & 483\u2013484.</ref>\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-Poster1914.jpg|thumb|right|160px|upright|The sesquicentennial poster]]\nThe Cammarian Club\u2014founded in 1893 and taking its name from the Latin for lobster, its members' favorite dinner food\u2014was at first a semi-secret society which \"tapped\" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the Club served as the ''de facto'' undergraduate student government. In 1971, unaccountably, it voted the name Cammarian Club out of existence, thereby amputating its tradition and longevity. The successor and present-day organization is the generically-named Undergraduate Council of Students.\n\n[[Societas Domi Pacificae]], known colloquially as \"Pacifica House,\" is a present-day, self-described secret society, which nonetheless publishes a website and an email address. It claims a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary \"Franklin Society\" traceable in the nineteenth century. But the intermediary turns out to be, on closer inspection, the well-known Providence Franklin Society, a civic organization unconnected to Brown whose origins and activity are well-documented. It was founded in 1821 by merchants William Grinnell and Joseph Balch, Jr., and chartered by the General Assembly in January 1823.<ref>Rhode Island Historical Society, \"Providence Franklin Society Records, 1826-1922,\" published online at [http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm]</ref> The \"Pacifica House\" account of this (conflated) Franklin Society cites published mentions of it in 1859, 1876, and 1883. But the first of these (Rhees 1859, see footnote ''infra'') is merely a sketch of the 1824 Brown organization; the second (Stockwell 1876) is a reference-book article on the Providence Franklin Society itself; and the third is the Providence Franklin Society's own publication, which the \"Pacifica House\" reference mis-ascribes to the \"Franklin Society,\" dropping the word \"Providence.\"<ref>The three cited items of \"evidence\" in Pacifica House publicity are William J. Rhees, ''Manual of Public Libraries, Institutions and Societies in the United States'' (Philadelphia, 1859), pp. 437-8; Thomas B. Stockwell, ''A History of Public Education in Rhode Island, from 1636 to 1876'' (Providence, 1876), p. 246; and Providence Franklin Society, ''Report on the Geology of Rhode Island'' (Providence, 1887, commissioned 1883), for which see, e.g., ''Bulletin of the United States Geological Survey'', no. 127 (Washington, 1896), p. 821)</ref>\n\n=== Student organizations ===\n{{See also|Category:Brown University organizations}}\nThere are over 300 registered student organizations on campus with diverse interests. The Student Activities Fair, during the orientation program, provides first-year students the opportunity to become acquainted with the wide range of organizations.

The centers often act as sources of support as well as safe spaces for students to explore certain aspects of their identity. Additionally, the centers often provide physical spaces for students to study and have meetings. Although most centers are identity-focused, some provide academic support as well.\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-PartridgeHall.jpg|thumb|left|The Brown Center for Students of Color]]\n\nThe [[Brown Center for Students of Color]] (BCSC) is a space that provides support for students [[People of color|of color]]. Established in 1972 at the demand of student protests, the BCSC encourages students to engage in critical dialogue, develop leadership skills, and promote [[social justice]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/students-of-color/about/frequently-asked-questions-faqs|website=Brown Center for Students of Color|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}</ref> The center houses various programs for students to share their knowledge and engage in discussion. Programs include the Third World Transition Program, the Minority Peer Counselor Program, the Heritage Series, and other student-led initiatives. Additionally, the BCSC hopes to foster community among the students it serves by providing spaces for students to meet and study.\n\nThe [[Sarah Doyle Women's Center]] aims to provide a space for members of the Brown community to examine and explore issues surrounding [[gender]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Sarah Doyle Women's Center|url=https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/sarah-doyle-center/|website=Sarah Doyle Women's Center|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref> The center was named after one of the first women to attend Brown University, [[Sarah Doyle]]. The center emphasizes [[intersectionality]] in its conversations on gender, encouraging people to see gender as present and relevant in various aspects of life. The center hosts programs and workshops in order to facilitate dialogue and provide resources for students, faculty, and staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guiding Philosophies|url=https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/sarah-doyle-center/guiding-philosophies|website=Sarah Doyle Women's Center|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOther centers include the [[LGBT|LGBTQ+]] Center, the First-Generation College and Low-Income Student (FLi) Center, and the Curricular Resource Center.\n\n=== Controversy over ADA mental health discrimination ===\n\nLike many colleges, Brown mandates forced medical leaves for students expressing feelings of self-harm, depression, schizophrenia, or other forms of mental illness. Controversy arises within the college as to whether Brown follows the US Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, with Brown's own newspaper, ''The Brown Daily Herald'', criticizing the University's policy behind readmission from psychological medical leave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/09/19/newlon-145-a-pattern-of-prejudice/|title=Newlon '14.5: A pattern of prejudice|author=Cara Newlon|work=Brown Daily Herald|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}</ref> According to a 2010 article in ''The Brown Daily Herald'', even Dean of Student Life & Chair of the Medical Leave Readmission Committee Maria Suarez admits that, \"I wish we had more resources to connect with students.\" Suarez said, \"The support is there, but it is student-initiated.\"<ref name=\"crystalvanceguerra\">{{cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2010/09/27/psychological-leavetakers-miss-u-contact/|title=Psychological leave-takers miss U. contact|author=Crystal Vance Guerra|work=Brown Daily Herald|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}</ref> However, Suarez has been widely criticized within and outside the University as being non-compliant with American ADA laws, often denying students readmission for little to no reason.<ref name=\"caranewlon, usatodaycollege\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2013/11/04/univ-medical-leaves-unhelpful/3359813/|title=Policies hamper students' return from mental health leave|author=Cara Newlon, USA TODAY College|date=November 4, 2013|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}</ref> Moreover, the University leaves students with few guidelines on how to become readmitted; students report that very little communication is made with the University during a leave of absence, and that the University does not aid disabled students in their progress. One mentally disabled student alleges, after 5 semesters of mandatory leave, that: \"One of the administrators [Suarez], he claims, told him: \"You should consider yourself lucky because Brown's better than other schools. At least you're not getting kicked out of Brown.\"'<ref name=\"caranewlon, usatodaycollege\"/> The psychological leave readmission process takes place once every 6 months, and requires only a student's statement and a psychiatrist's or psychologist's statement of well-being, with no interview. Many students report that the process is not thorough enough to judge one's own progress in mental health, thereby violating ADA rights; the denial letters are often short and generic, with one sentence changed at most for multiple denials.<ref name=\"crystalvanceguerra\"/>\n\n==Rankings==\n{{Infobox US university ranking\n| ARWU_NU = 49-60\n| USNWR_NU = 14\n| USNWR_W = 85\n|THE_WSJ=7| Forbes = 8\n| QS_W = 53\n| THES_W = 50\n| ARWU_W = 100-150\n| Wamo_NU = 19\n}}\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-UniversityHall.jpg|thumb|left|[[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]], built 1770\u20131771, designed by a committee that included [[Joseph Brown (astronomer)|Joseph Brown]], is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]]]\n\n{|class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 22em;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\" |\n<big>USNWR graduate school rankings</big><ref name=\"USNWR Grad School Rankings\">{{cite web|title=Brown University - U.S. News Best Grad School Rankings|publisher=''U.S. News & World Report''|accessdate=8 June 2017|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/brown-university-217156/overall-rankings}}</ref>\n|-\n| Engineering\n| 52\n|-\n| Medicine: Primary Care\n| 21\n|-\n| Medicine: Research\n| 31\n|}\n\n{|class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 22em;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\" |\n<big>USNWR departmental rankings</big><ref name=\"USNWR Grad School Rankings\"/>\n|-\n| Applied Mathematics\n| 4\n|-\n| Biological Sciences\n| 33\n|-\n| Chemistry\n| 59\n|-\n| Computer Science\n| 25\n|-\n| Earth Sciences\n| 15\n|-\n| Economics\n| 19\n|-\n| English\n| 13\n|-\n| History\n| 16\n|-\n| Mathematics\n| 14\n|-\n| Physics\n| 35\n|-\n| Political Science\n| 40\n|-\n| Psychology\n| 26\n|-\n| Public Affairs\n| 64\n|-\n| Sociology\n| 24\n|-\n| Statistics\n| 44\n|}\n\nIn 2014, [[National Science Foundation]] ranked Brown University 66th in the United States by research.<ref>[https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site?method=rankingBySource&ds=herd Ncsesdata.nsf.gov]</ref> For 2017, ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' ranks Brown University 85th globally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/brown-university-217156|title=Usnews.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 2013 ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings' peer assessment portion gives the school a score of 4.4, tied with [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]], and [[University of Michigan]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Which Universities Are Ranked Highest by College Officials?

Atkinson worked at [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] from 1978 to 1990.\n\nAtkinson was the principal designer and developer of the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) of the [[Apple Lisa]] and, later, one of the first thirty members of the original Apple [[Macintosh]] development team,<ref name=\"lemmons198402\" /> and was the creator of the ground-breaking [[MacPaint]] application, which fulfilled the vision of using the computer as a creative tool. He also designed and implemented [[QuickDraw]], the fundamental toolbox that the Lisa and Macintosh used for graphics. QuickDraw's performance was essential for the success of the Macintosh GUI. He also was one of the main designers of the Lisa and Macintosh [[user interface]]s. Atkinson also conceived, designed and implemented [[HyperCard]], the first popular [[hypermedia]] system. HyperCard put the power of computer programming and database design into the hands of non[[programmer]]s. In 1994, Atkinson received the [[EFF Pioneer Award]] for his contributions.\n\n== Education==\nHe received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of California, San Diego]], where Apple Macintosh developer [[Jef Raskin]] was one of his professors. Atkinson continued his studies as a graduate student in neurochemistry at the [[University of Washington]]. Raskin invited Atkinson to visit him at [[Apple Computer]]; [[Steve Jobs]] persuaded him to join the company immediately as employee #51, and Atkinson never finished his PhD.<ref name=\"Isaacson2014\" /><ref name=\"Tri244\">{{Triangulation|244|Bill Atkinson}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nAround 1990, [[General Magic]]'s founding, with Bill Atkinson as one of the three cofounders, met the following press in ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine:\n<blockquote>The obstacles to General Magic's success may appear daunting, but General Magic is not your typical start-up company. Its partners include some of the biggest players in the worlds of computing, communications, and consumer electronics, and it's loaded with top-notch engineers who have been given a clean slate to reinvent traditional approaches to ubiquitous worldwide communications.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec3/art1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970713005548/http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec3/art1.htm |archive-date=July 13, 1997 |title=Just Like Magic? |publisher=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]] |first1=Tom R. |last1=Halfhill |first2=Andy |last2=Reinhardt |date=February 1994}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2007, Atkinson began working as an outside developer with [[Numenta]], a startup working on computer intelligence. On his work there Atkinson said, \"what Numenta is doing is more fundamentally important to society than the personal computer and the rise of the Internet.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/02/01/8398989/ |title=Jeff Hawkins and the Brain |work=Business 2.0 |publisher=CNN |first=Erick |last=Schonfeld |date=March 6, 2007 |access-date=2017-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625063943/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/02/01/8398989/index.htm |archive-date=25 June 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, Atkinson has combined his passion for computer programming with his love of [[nature photography]] to create art images. He takes close-up photographs of stones that have been cut and polished. His works are highly regarded for their resemblance to miniature landscapes which are hidden within the stones. Atkinson's 2004 book ''Within the Stone'' features a collection of his close-up photographs. The highly intricate and detailed images he creates are made possible by the accuracy and creative control of the digital printing process that he helped create.\n\nSome of Atkinson's noteworthy contributions to the field of computing include:\n* Macintosh [[QuickDraw]] and Lisa LisaGraf\n** Atkinson independently discovered the [[midpoint circle algorithm]] for fast drawing of circles by using the sum of consecutive odd numbers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.txt |title=Steve Jobs |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}</ref>\n* [[Marching ants]]\n* The [[double-click]]\n* [[Menu bar]]\n* The [[selection lasso]]\n* [[FatBits]]\n* [[MacPaint]]\n* [[HyperCard]]\n* [[Dither#Algorithms|Atkinson dithering]]\n* Bill Atkinson PhotoCard<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bill-atkinson-photocard/id333208430?mt=8 Bill Atkinson PhotoCard]</ref>\n\nAtkinson now works as a nature photographer.

They resulted in victory for the Royalists commanded by [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] over the Parliamentarians commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter defeating the army of Sir [[William Waller]] at the [[Battle of Cropredy Bridge]], King Charles marched west in pursuit of the Parliamentarian army of the Earl of Essex, who was invading the Royalist stronghold of [[Cornwall]].\n\nEssex had been misled into believing that he could expect substantial support from the people of Cornwall. When he had reached [[Bodmin]] on 28 July, he found that there was no chance of supplies or recruits, and he also learned that the Royalist army was at [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]], close to his rear. He withdrew to [[Lostwithiel]], covering the port of [[Fowey]]. Essex had previously arranged to rendezvous at Fowey with the Parliamentarian fleet under the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], but no ships appeared. Warwick was unable to leave [[Portsmouth]] because of westerly winds.\n\nCharles's army had been reinforced as it marched, and outnumbered that of Essex by nearly two to one. The first clashes took place on 2 August, but little action took place for several days, as the King waited for all his forces to arrive and Essex waited for the fleet.\n\n==Battle==\nOn 13 August, the Royalists began to attack in earnest, occupying several outposts on the east bank of the [[River Fowey]], making it even more difficult for help to reach Essex. A Parliamentarian attempt to send a relieving force under Lieutenant General [[John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton|Middleton]] was defeated at [[Bridgwater]] in [[Somerset]].\n\nOn 21 August, the Royalists attacked Essex's positions north of Lostwithiel, capturing the ruins of [[Restormel Castle]]. Royalist cavalry threatened to cut the Parliamentarians off from Fowey. Essex realised that there was no hope of relief and ordered his cavalry to break out of the encirclement. Under Sir [[William Balfour (general)|William Balfour]], they broke through the Royalist lines on the night of 31 August, eventually reaching [[Plymouth]] thirty miles to the east.\n\nThe increasingly demoralised Parliamentarian infantry fell back towards Fowey in pouring rain. They were forced to abandon several guns which became bogged down in the muddy roads. On 1 September, the pursuing Royalists captured [[Castle Dore]], another ruined fortification which the Parliamentarians were using to anchor their lines. Essex left Sir [[Philip Skippon]], his Sergeant Major General of Foot, in command while he himself escaped to Plymouth in a fishing boat.\n\nOn 2 September, Skippon, having been told that his infantry were unable to break out as the cavalry had done, and having been offered generous terms by the King, surrendered 6,000 infantry and all his army's guns and train.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe disarmed soldiers marched eastward to Portsmouth in continuing bad weather, being continually robbed and threatened by local people. About 1,000 died of exposure and hunger, and 1,000 more deserted or fell sick.\n\nCharles meanwhile wheeled about and marched towards London.\n\nThis setback for Parliament in [[Cornwall]], and the last major victory for the Royalists, was reversed by [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] leading the [[New Model Army]] at or near [[Tresillian|Tresillian Bridge]], close to [[Truro]] on 12 March 1645.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Battle of Braddock Down]] which took place in January 1643 a few miles from Lostwithiel.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Cornwall in the Great Civil War and Interregnum 1642 - 1660''; by Mary Coate.

In June 1874 Russell's mother died of [[diphtheria]], followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father died of [[bronchitis]] following a long period of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] paternal grandparents, who lived at [[Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park|Pembroke Lodge]] in [[Richmond Park]]. His grandfather, former Prime Minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Earl Russell]], died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the [[Frances Russell, Countess Russell|Countess Russell]] (n\u00e9e Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.<ref name=\"Gallery\"/><ref name=\"calicut\"/>\n\nThe countess was from a Scottish [[Presbyterian]] family, and successfully petitioned the [[Court of Chancery]] to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting [[Darwinism]] and supporting [[Home Rule|Irish Home Rule]]), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on [[social justice]] and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. (One could challenge the view that Bertrand stood up for his principles, based on his own well-known quotation: \"I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong\".) Her favourite Bible verse, \"Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 23:2), became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression, and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.\n\nRussell's adolescence was very lonely, and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in religion and mathematics, and that only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide.<ref>{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=38|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}</ref> He was educated at home by a series of tutors.<ref name=\"nobel prize\">The Nobel Foundation (1950).

The Italians had responded to [[Georg Cantor]], making a science of [[set theory]]; they gave Russell their literature including the [[Formulario mathematico]]. Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon [[Russell's paradox]]. In 1903 he published ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'', a work on foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of [[logicism]], that mathematics and logic are one and the same.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1950/russell-bio.html|title=Bertrand Russell, biography|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a \"sort of mystic illumination\", after witnessing [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s wife's acute suffering in an [[Angina pectoris|angina]] attack. \"I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty ... and with a desire almost as profound as that of the [[Buddha]] to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable\", Russell would later recall. \"At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|chapter=6: Principia Mathematica|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905 he wrote the essay \"[[On Denoting]]\", which was published in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''.

This, along with the earlier ''The Principles of Mathematics'', soon made Russell world-famous in his field.\n\nIn 1910 he became a [[University of Cambridge]] lecturer at Trinity College where he studied. He was considered for a Fellowship, which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions, but was passed over because he was \"anti-clerical\", essentially because he was agnostic. He was approached by the Austrian engineering student [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who became his PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various [[phobia]]s and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' in 1922.<ref name=\"Wittgenstein\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/history/rvw001.htm|title=Russell on Wittgenstein|publisher=Rbjones.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> Russell delivered his lectures on [[Logical Atomism]], his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of [[World War I]].

H. Hardy on the Trinity controversy and Russell's personal life===\nIn 1941, [[G. H. Hardy]] wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled ''Bertrand Russell and Trinity'' &ndash; published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by [[C. D. Broad]] &ndash; in which he gave an authoritative account about Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.\n\nThe reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it, since this would have been an \"unusual application\" and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered due to Russell's resignation since the \u2018world of learning\u2019 knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the ''Tarner Lectures'' on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best received books according to Hardy: ''The Analysis of Matter'', published in 1927.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bertrand Russell and Trinity|author=G. H.

In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practiced in the Soviet Union.<ref>He wrote: \"There is reason to think Stalin will insist on a new orthodoxy in atomic physics, since there is much in quantum theory that runs contrary to Communist dogma.

Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to ''Words and Things'' by [[Ernest Gellner]], which was highly critical of the later thought of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and of [[ordinary language philosophy]]. [[Gilbert Ryle]] refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', which caused Russell to respond via ''[[The Times]]''. The result was a month-long correspondence in ''The Times'' between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.<ref>T.

In 1952 Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother).\n\nRussell married his fourth wife, [[Edith Finch Russell|Edith Finch]], soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952.

Russell's eldest son John suffered from serious [[mental illness]], which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora.\n\nIn September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton Prison]] for \"breach of peace\" after taking part in [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)#1961|an anti-nuclear demonstration]] in London.

This incident fused two of his most controversial causes, as he had failed to be granted Fellow status, which would have protected him from firing, because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout Christian, or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic.\n\nHe later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression, citing the incident in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]], where he explained that the expression of any idea, even the most obviously \"bad\", must be protected not only from direct State intervention, but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced:\n\n{{quote|The opinions which are still persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous and immoral that the general principle of toleration cannot be held to apply to them.\n\nBut this is exactly the same view as that which made possible the tortures of the Inquisition.<ref name=\"free\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44932/44932-h/44932-h.htm Free Thought and Official Propaganda]</ref>}}\n\nRussell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to [[nuclear disarmament]] and opposing the [[Vietnam War]].

He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period.\n\nIn 1956, immediately before and during the [[Suez Crisis]], Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the  pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the [[Suez Canal]] area \"where general interest is involved\". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets \"because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating\". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which [[Michael Polanyi]] had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had already entered Budapest.<ref>''Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'' (Psychology Press, 2005)</ref>\n\nIn November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], urging a summit to consider \"the conditions of co-existence\". Khrushchev responded that peace could indeed be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in ''[[The Observer]]'', proposing a cessation of all nuclear-weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary, and with Germany \"freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West\". US Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as ''The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles''.<ref name=ref1>''Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell'' (pp. 212\u2013213)</ref>\n\nRussell was asked by ''[[The New Republic]]'', a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He urged that all nuclear-weapons testing and constant flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]], with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the [[Oder-Neisse line]] as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in Central Europe, consisting at the minimum of Germany, Poland, [[Hungary]], and [[Czechoslovakia]], with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing [[Arab nationalism]], and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard Israel's frontiers to ensure that Israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it. He also suggested Western recognition of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]].<ref name=ref1/>\n\nHe was in contact with [[Lionel Rogosin]] while the latter was filming his anti-war film ''[[Good Times, Wonderful Times]]'' in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the [[New Left]]. In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the [[Vietnam War]], and felt that the US government's policies there were near-[[genocide|genocidal]]. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the [[Jerusalem Prize]], an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.<ref name=\"jerusalem prize\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalembookfair.com/main.html|title=Jerusalem International Book Fair|publisher=Jerusalembookfair.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> In 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to Israel and the [[Arab world|Arab countries]] to accept an [[arms embargo]] and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1964/02/26/archive/bertrand-russell-appeals-to-arabs-and-israel-on-rocket-weapons|title=Bertrand Russell Appeals to Arabs and Israel on Rocket Weapons|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}</ref> In October 1965 he tore up his [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] card because he suspected [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.<ref name=\"Gallery\"/>\n\n===Final years and death===\nIn June 1955 Russell had leased Plas Penrhyn in [[Penrhyndeudraeth]], Merionethshire, Wales and on 5 July of the following year it became his and Edith's principal residence.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Andrew G.

The same month, he appealed to Secretary General [[U Thant]] of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. The following month, he protested to [[Alexei Kosygin]] over the expulsion of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] from the [[Soviet Union of Writers]].\n\nOn 31 January 1970 Russell issued a statement condemning \"Israel's aggression in the Middle East\", and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the [[War of Attrition]]. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-[[Six-Day War]] borders. This was Russell's final political statement or act.

He was deeply impressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646\u20131716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except [[aesthetics]]. He was particularly prolific in the field of [[metaphysics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Logic and philosophy of mathematics|logic and the philosophy of mathematics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Philosophy of language|philosophy of language]], [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Ethics|ethics]] and [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Epistemology|epistemology]]. When [[Brand Blanshard]] asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, \"but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects\".<ref>Blanshard, in [[Paul Arthur Schilpp]], ed., ''The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard'', Open Court, 1980, p.&nbsp;88, quoting a private letter from Russell.</ref>\n\nOn ethics, Russell considered himself a [[utilitarian]].<ref>''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'', London: Routledge, 2000 [London: Allen and Unwin, 1969, Vol. 1], p.&nbsp;39 (\"It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise. Belief in happiness, I found, was called Utilitarianism, and was merely one among a number of ethical theories. I adhered to it after this discovery.\").</ref>\n\nFor the advancement of science ''and'' protection of the right to freedom of expression, Russell advocated [[The Will to Doubt]], the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess, that one should always remember:\n\n{{quote|''None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error''. The methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate. These methods are practised in science, and have built up the body of scientific knowledge.\n\n''Every man of science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the progress of discovery; nevertheless, it is near enough to the truth to serve for most practical purposes, though not for all. In science, where alone something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found, men\u2019s attitude is tentative and full of doubt''.}}\n\n===Religion===\nRussell described himself in 1947 as an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], saying: \"Therefore, in regard to the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympic gods]], speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], I should, I think, take exactly the same line.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |title=Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic? |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |year=1947 |work=Encyclopedia of Things |accessdate=6 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622001026/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |archivedate=22 June 2005 |df=dmy }}: \"I never know whether I should say \"Agnostic\" or whether I should say \"Atheist\"... As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove (sic) that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist...\"</ref> For most of his adult life, Russell maintained religion to be little more than [[superstition]] and, in spite of any positive effects, largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and to be responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the [[British Humanist Association]] and President of Cardiff Humanists until his death.<ref>'Humanist News', March 1970</ref>\n\n===Society===\n{{Main|Bertrand Russell's views on society}}\nPolitical and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes.\n\nRussell argued for a \"scientific society\", where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Impact of Science on Society|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|chapter=Conclusions|year=1952}}</ref> He suggested the establishment of a \"single supreme world government\" able to enforce peace,<ref>{{cite book|title=Which Way to Peace? ''(Part 12)''|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=173|publisher=M. Joseph Ltd.|year=1936}}</ref> claiming that \"the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Human Society in Ethics and Politics|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=212|publisher=London: G. Allen & Unwin|year=1954}}</ref>\n\nRussell was an active supporter of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]], being one of the signatories of [[A. E. Dyson]]'s 1958 letter to ''The Times'' calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.<ref name=\"GALHA\">{{cite web|title=Lesbian and Gay Rights: The Humanist and Religious Stances|url=http://www.galha.org/briefing/lgb_rights.html|author=Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association|date=2 November 1997|accessdate=17 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn \"Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday\" (\"Postscript\" in his ''Autobiography''), Russell wrote: \"I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1944\u20131969|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=330|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1968}} Published separately as 'Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday' in ''Portraits from Memory''.</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|width=100%|align=center|collapsed=yes\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

It was Boeing's first wide-body [[twinjet]] and its first airliner with a two-crew [[glass cockpit]]. The aircraft has two [[turbofan]] engines, a conventional [[tailplane|tail]], and, for reduced [[aerodynamic drag]], a [[supercritical airfoil|supercritical wing]] design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft such as the [[Boeing 747|747]], the 767 has a seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a [[Range (aeronautics)|design range]] of {{Convert|3850|to|6385|nmi|km|lk=in}}, depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body]] twinjet, the [[Boeing 757|757]], resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common [[type rating]] to operate both aircraft.\n\nThe 767 is produced in three [[fuselage]] lengths. The original 767-200 entered service in 1982, followed by the 767-300 in 1986 and the 767-400ER, an extended-range (ER) variant, in 2000. The extended-range 767-200ER and 767-300ER models entered service in 1984 and 1988, respectively, while a production [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]] version, the 767-300F, debuted in 1995. Conversion programs have modified passenger 767-200 and 767-300 series aircraft for cargo use, while military derivatives include the [[Boeing E-767|E-767]] [[Airborne early warning and control|surveillance]] aircraft, the [[Boeing KC-767|KC-767]] and [[Boeing KC-46|KC-46]] aerial [[aerial refueling|tankers]], and VIP transports. Engines featured on the 767 include the [[General Electric CF6]], [[Pratt & Whitney JT9D]] and [[Pratt & Whitney PW4000|PW4000]], and [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] turbofans.\n\n[[United Airlines]] first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982. The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and [[Transcontinental flight across the United States|transcontinental]] routes, during which it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design. In 1985, the 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights. The aircraft was then used to expand [[Non-stop flight|non-stop]] service on [[Flight length|medium- to long-haul]] intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading to the development of the [[Boeing 777|777]], a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for [[transatlantic flight]]s between [[North America]] and [[Europe]].\n\nThe 767 is the first twinjet wide-body type to reach 1,000 aircraft delivered.  As of August 2018, Boeing has received 1,224 orders for the 767 from 74 customers with 1,118 delivered.<ref name=767_O_D_summ/> A total of 742 of these aircraft were in service in July 2018.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/asset/24536|title=World Airline Census 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Flightglobal.com|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-21}}</ref> The most popular variant is the 767-300ER with 583 delivered. [[Delta Air Lines]] is the largest operator with 77 aircraft. Competitors have included the [[Airbus A300]], [[Airbus A310|A310]], and [[Airbus A330|A330-200]]. Non-passenger variants of the 767 remain in production as of 2018 while the passenger variant's successor, the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]], entered service in 2011.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1970, Boeing's 747 became the first wide-body jetliner to enter service.<ref name=Eden_p102/> The 747 was the first passenger jet wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutter|2006|p=103}}</ref> Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the [[Boeing 707|707]] and other early generation narrow-body jets.<ref name=n157/><ref name=saver/> The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], and [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] wide-bodies.<ref name=n157/> To defray the high cost of development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation [[Aeritalia]] and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies.<ref name=n156>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=156}}</ref> This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation.<ref name=n156/> The initial 7X7 was conceived as a [[STOL|short take-off and landing]] airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner.<ref name=n157>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|pp=156\u201357.}}</ref> At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a [[T-tail]].<ref name=Eden_p102>{{harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=102\u201303}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Delta Air Lines Boeing 767-232 Farnborough 1982 Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|The 7X7 made its [[Farnborough Airshow]] debut in 1982 as the 767-200.|alt=Side view of twin-engine jet touching down on runway, with deployed flaps and thrust reversers]]\nBy 1976, a twinjet layout, similar to the one which had debuted on the [[Airbus A300]], became the baseline configuration.<ref name=no20/> The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants.<ref name=no20>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=20\u201321}}</ref> While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous,<ref name=no20/> the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets.<ref name=Eden_p102/> As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities.<ref name=Eden_p103>{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=103}}</ref> Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including [[high-bypass turbofan|high-bypass-ratio turbofan]] engines, new flight deck systems,

were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757.<ref name=no19/> Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.<ref name=davies103>{{harvnb|Davies|2000|p=103}}</ref><ref name=n143/>\n\nIn January 1978, Boeing announced a major extension of its [[Boeing Everett Factory|Everett factory]]\u2014which was then dedicated to manufacturing the 747\u2014to accommodate its new wide-body family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=8}}</ref> In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation,<ref>{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|p=24}}</ref> and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a [[trijet]] 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes.<ref name=no20/><ref>{{harvnb|Donald|1997|page=173}}</ref> The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes.<ref

[[American Airlines]] and Delta Air Lines later that year.<ref name=n159/> The 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity was too close to the 757's seating,<ref name=n159/> while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration.<ref name=no20/>\n\n===Design effort===\nIn the late 1970s, [[operating cost]] replaced capacity as the

He served as head coach of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford Cardinal football team]], during which time he popularized the [[West Coast offense]]. After retiring from the 49ers, Walsh worked as a sports broadcaster for several years and then returned as head coach at Stanford for three seasons.\n\nWalsh went 102\u201363\u20131 with the 49ers, winning 10 of his 14 postseason games along with six division titles, three [[NFC Championship Game|NFC Championship]] titles, and three [[Super Bowls]]. He was named NFL Coach of the Year in 1981 and 1984. In 1993, he was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Los Angeles]], Walsh played running back in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] for [[Hayward High School]] in [[Hayward, California|Hayward]].<ref name=\"semtyh\">{{cite web | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/30/BAG57LR8OK21.DTL | title=Former 49er head coach Bill Walsh dies | first=Tom | last=Fitzgerald | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=2007-07-30 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112203709/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2007%2F07%2F30%2FBAG57LR8OK21.DTL | archivedate=November 12, 2007 | deadurl=yes | df= }}</ref>\nWalsh played [[quarterback]] at the [[College of San Mateo]] for two seasons.

After playing at the College of San Mateo, Walsh transferred to [[San Jos\u00e9 State University]], where he played [[tight end]] and [[defensive end]]. He also participated in intercollegiate [[boxing]]. Walsh graduated from San Jose State with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[physical education]] in 1955.

Levy and Walsh, two future NFL Hall of Famers, would never produce a winning season at [[California Golden Bears football|Cal]].\n\nAfter coaching at Cal, Walsh did a stint at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] as an assistant coach, before beginning his pro coaching career.\n\n==Early professional coaching career==\nWalsh began his pro coaching career in [[1966 AFL season|1966]] as an assistant with the [[American Football League|AFL]]'s [[Oakland Raiders]]. As a Raider assistant, Walsh was trained in the vertical passing offense favored by [[Al Davis]], putting Walsh in Davis's mentor [[Sid Gillman#Coaching tree|Sid Gillman's coaching tree]].\n\nIn 1967 Walsh was the head coach and general manager of the [[San Jose Apaches]] of the [[Continental Football League]] (CFL). Walsh led the Apaches to 2nd place in the Pacific Division. Prior to the start of the 1968 CFL season the Apaches ceased all football operations.\n\nIn [[1968 AFL season|1968]], Walsh moved to the AFL expansion [[Cincinnati Bengals]], joining the staff of legendary coach [[Paul Brown]]. It was there that Walsh developed the philosophy now known as the \"West Coast Offense\", as a matter of necessity. Cincinnati's new [[quarterback]], [[Virgil Carter]], was known for his great mobility and accuracy but lacked a strong arm necessary to throw deep passes. Thus, Walsh modified the vertical passing scheme he had learned during his time with the Raiders, designing a horizontal passing system that relied on quick, short throws, often spreading the ball across the entire width of the field.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.milehighreport.com/2009/5/27/886729/bill-walsh-bill-parcells-and-the | title=Bill Walsh, Bill Parcells and the Rise of the Left Tackle | publisher=MileHighReport.com | date=May 27, 2009 | author=Doc Bear}}</ref>  The new offense was much better suited to Carter's physical abilities; he led the league in pass completion percentage in 1971.\n\nWalsh spent eight seasons as an assistant with the Bengals. [[Ken Anderson (quarterback)|Ken Anderson]] eventually replaced Carter as starting quarterback, and together with star [[wide receiver]] [[Isaac Curtis]], produced a consistent, effective offensive attack. Initially, Walsh started out as the wide receivers coach from 1968 to 1970 before also coaching the quarterbacks from 1971 to 1975.\n\nWhen Brown retired as head coach following the [[1975 NFL season|1975]] season and appointed [[Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson]] as his successor, Walsh resigned and served as an assistant coach for [[Tommy Prothro]] with the [[San Diego Chargers]] in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. In a 2006 interview,<ref>{{cite news | author=Sam Farmer | title=Living Legend | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 22, 2006 | page=D1}}</ref> Walsh claimed that during his tenure with the Bengals, Brown \"worked against my candidacy\" to be a head coach anywhere in the league. \"All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them,\" Walsh said. \"And then when I left him, he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep me out of the NFL.\"\n\nIn 1977, Walsh was hired as the head coach at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] where he stayed for two seasons. His two Stanford teams were successful, posting a 9\u20133 record in 1977 with a win in the [[1977 Sun Bowl (December)|Sun Bowl]], and 8\u20134 in 1978 with a win in the [[1978 Bluebonnet Bowl|Bluebonnet Bowl]]. His notable players at Stanford included quarterbacks [[Guy Benjamin]] and [[Steve Dils]], wide receivers [[James Lofton]] and [[Ken Margerum]], linebacker [[Gordy Ceresino]], in addition to running back [[Darrin Nelson]]. Walsh was the [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-8 Conference]] Coach of the Year in 1977.\n\n==49ers head coach==\nIn [[1979 NFL season|1979]], Walsh was hired as head coach of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] by owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr.]] The long-suffering 49ers went 2\u201314 in [[1978 NFL Season|1978]], the season before Walsh's arrival and repeated the same dismal record in his first season. But, Walsh got the entire organization to buy into his philosophy and vowed to turn around a miserable situation. He also drafted quarterback [[Joe Montana]] from [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] in the third round. Despite their second consecutive 2-14 record, the 49ers were playing more competitive football.\n\nIn [[1980 NFL Season|1980]], [[Steve DeBerg]] was the starting quarterback who got San Francisco off to a 3-0 start, but after a 59-14 blowout loss to Dallas in week 6, Walsh promoted Montana to starting QB. In a Sunday game, December 7 vs. the New Orleans Saints, Montana brought the 49ers back from a 35-7 halftime deficit to win 38-35 in overtime. The 49ers improved to 6\u201310, but more importantly, Walsh had them making great strides and they were getting better every week.\n\n===1981 championship===\nIn [[1981 NFL season|1981]], four important wins were two wins each over the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The Rams were only two season removed from a [[Super Bowl XIV|Super Bowl]] appearance, and had dominated the series with the 49ers since 1967 winning 23, losing 3 and tying 1. San Francisco's two wins over the Rams in 1981 marked the shift of dominance in favor of the 49ers that lasted until 1998 with 30 wins (including 17 consecutively) against only 6 defeats. The 49ers blew out the Cowboys in week 6 of the regular season. On ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' that week, the win was not included in the halftime highlights. Walsh felt that this was because the Cowboys were scheduled to play the Rams the next week in a Sunday night game and that showing the highlights of the 49ers' win would potentially hurt the game's ratings. However, Walsh used this as a motivating factor for his team, who felt they were disrespected.<ref>{{cite book | author=Bill Walsh | title=The Score Takes Care of Itself: My Philosophy of Leadership | publisher=[[Penguin Group]] | year=2009 | page=169}}</ref>\n\nThe 49ers faced the Cowboys again that same season in the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] title game. The game was very close, and in the fourth quarter Walsh called a series of running plays as the 49ers marched down the field against the Cowboys' prevent defense, which had been expecting the 49ers to mainly pass. The 49ers came from behind to win the game on Dwight Clark's touchdown reception, known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]], propelling Walsh to his first Super Bowl. Walsh would later write that the 49ers' two wins over the Rams showed a shift of power in their division, while the wins over the Cowboys showed a shift of power in the conference.\n\nSan Francisco won its first championship just two years after winning only two games. The 49ers won [[Super Bowl XVI]] defeating the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] 26-21 in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].  Under Walsh the team rose from the cellar to the top of the NFL in just two seasons.\n\nThe 49ers won [[Super Bowl]] championships in [[1981 NFL season|1981]], [[1984 NFL season|1984]] and [[1988 NFL season|1988 seasons]]. Walsh served as 49ers head coach for 10 years, and during his tenure he and his coaching staff perfected the style of play known popularly as the [[West Coast offense]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/sports/football/31walsh.html|title=\"Bill Walsh, Innovator of West Coast Offense, Dies at 75.\"|last=Goldstein|first=Richard|date=31 July 2007|work=New York Times|access-date=31 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}</ref> Walsh was nicknamed \"The Genius\" for both his innovative play calling and design. Walsh would regularly script the first 10-15 offensive plays before the start of each game. In the ten years during which Walsh was the 49ers' head coach, San Francisco scored 3,714 points (24.4 per game), the most of any team in the league during that span.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfref.com/tiny/XECxX|title=Pro-Football-Reference.com: In multiple seasons, from 1979 to 1988, in the Regular Season, requiring Underdog By >= 0, sorted by descending Points For.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to [[Joe Montana]], Walsh drafted [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Charles Haley]], and [[Jerry Rice]]. He also traded a 2nd and 4th round pick in the 1987 draft for [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]]. His success with the 49ers was rewarded with his election to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Professional Football Hall of Fame]] in 1993.  Montana, Lott, Haley, Rice and Young were also elected to the Hall of Fame.\n\n==Coaching tree==\n===Prominent assistant coaches===\nMany of Bill Walsh's assistant coaches went on to be head coaches themselves, including [[George Seifert]], [[Mike Holmgren]], [[Ray Rhodes]], and [[Dennis Green]]. After Walsh's retirement from the 49ers, Seifert succeeded him as 49ers head coach, and guided San Francisco to victories in [[Super Bowl XXIV]] and [[Super Bowl XXIX]]. Holmgren won a [[Super Bowl XXXI|Super Bowl]] with the [[Green Bay Packers]], and made 3 Super Bowl appearances as a head coach: 2 with the Packers, and another with the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. These coaches in turn have their own disciples who have used Walsh's West Coast system, such as former [[Washington Redskins]] head coach [[Mike Shanahan]] and former [[Houston Texans]] head coach [[Gary Kubiak]]. Mike Shanahan was an offensive coordinator under [[George Seifert]] and went on to win [[Super Bowl XXXII]] and [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] during his time as head coach of the [[Denver Broncos]]. Kubiak was first a [[quarterback]] coach with the 49ers, then [[offensive coordinator]] for Shanahan with the Broncos. In 2015, he became head coach and led Denver to victory in [[Super Bowl 50]]. [[Dennis Green]] trained [[Tony Dungy]], who won a [[Super Bowl XLI|Super Bowl]] with the [[Indianapolis Colts]], and [[Brian Billick]] with his brother-in law and linebackers coach [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]]. Billick won a [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl]] as head coach of the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. Mike Holmgren trained many of his assistants to become head coaches, including [[Jon Gruden]] and [[Andy Reid]]. Gruden won a [[Super Bowl XXXVII|Super Bowl]] with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Reid served as head coach of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] from 1999-2012, and guided the Eagles to multiple winning seasons and numerous playoff appearances. In addition to this, [[Marc Trestman]], former head coach of the [[Chicago Bears]], served as Offensive Coordinator under Seifert in the 90's. Gruden himself would train [[Mike Tomlin]], who led the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to their [[Super Bowl XLIII|sixth Super Bowl championship]], and [[Jim Harbaugh]], whose 49ers would face his brother, [[John Harbaugh]], whom Reid himself trained, and the [[Baltimore Ravens]] at [[Super Bowl XLVII]], which marked the Ravens' second World Championship.\n\nBill Walsh was viewed as a strong advocate for African-American head coaches in the NFL and NCAA.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives2001/features_2001/dickey_011402.asp | title=It's past time | author=Glenn Dickey | publisher=''ProFootballWeekly.com'' | date=2002-01-14 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121164442/http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives2001/features_2001/dickey_011402.asp | archivedate=2006-11-21 | df= }}</ref> Thus, the impact of Walsh also changed the NFL into an equal opportunity for African-American coaches. Along with [[Ray Rhodes]] and [[Dennis Green]], [[Tyrone Willingham]] became the head coach at Stanford, then later [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] and Washington. One of [[Mike Shanahan]]'s assistants, [[Karl Dorrell]] went on to be the head coach at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Walsh directly helped propel Dennis Green into the NFL head coaching ranks by offering to take on the head coaching job at Stanford.\n\n===Bill Walsh coaching tree===\nMany former and current NFL head coaches trace their lineage back to Bill Walsh on his [[coaching tree]], shown below.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/s/westcoast/history.html | title=An offense by any other name ... | author=Len Pasquarelli | publisher=''ESPN.com'' | accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref> Walsh, in turn, belonged to the coaching tree of [[American Football League]] great and Hall of Fame coach [[Sid Gillman]] of the AFL's [[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers]] and Hall of Fame coach [[Paul Brown]].\n[[File:Bill Walsh Coaching Tree.svg|center]]\n\n==Later career==\nAfter leaving the coaching ranks immediately following his team's victory in [[Super Bowl XXIII]], Walsh went to work as a broadcaster for [[NFL on NBC|NBC]], teaming with [[Dick Enberg]] to form the lead broadcasting team, replacing [[Merlin Olsen]].\n\nWalsh returned to Stanford as head coach in 1992, leading the Cardinal to a 10\u20133 record and a [[Pacific-10 Conference]] co-championship. Stanford finished the season with an upset victory over [[Penn State]] in the [[1993 Blockbuster Bowl|Blockbuster Bowl]] on January 1, 1993 and a #9 ranking in the final [[AP Poll]]. In 1994, after consecutive losing seasons, Walsh left Stanford and retired from coaching.\n\nIn 1996 Walsh returned to the 49ers as an administrative aide <ref>{{cite web|title=Adding Walsh to the 49ers Could Stir up Trouble|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-24/sports/sp-28018_1_bill-walsh|website=LA Times}}</ref> Walsh was the Vice President and General Manager for the 49ers from [[1999 San Francisco 49ers season|1999]] to [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|2001]] and was a special consultant to the team for three years afterwards.\n\nIn 2004, Walsh was appointed as special assistant to the athletic director at Stanford. In 2005, after then-athletic director Ted Leland stepped down, Walsh was named interim athletic director. He also acted as a consultant for his alma mater [[San Jose State University]] in their search for an Athletic Director and Head Football Coach in 2005.\n\nWalsh was also the author of three books, a motivational speaker, and taught classes at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].\n\nWalsh was a Board Member for the [[Lott Trophy|Lott IMPACT Trophy]], which is named after [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] defensive back [[Ronnie Lott]], and is awarded annually to college football's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year.

Craft knives are tools mostly used for crafts.  Today, the term \"utility knife\" also includes small folding or retractable-blade knives suited for use in the general workplace or in the construction industry.\n\nThere is also a [[Kitchen knife#Utility|utility knife for kitchen use]], which is between a chef's knife and paring knife in size.\n\n==History==\nThe fixed-blade utility knife was developed some 500,000 years ago, when human ancestors began to make knives made of stone.<ref name=\"PET\"/>  These knives were general-purpose tools, designed for cutting and shaping wooden implements, scraping hides, preparing food, and for other utilitarian purposes.<ref name=\"PET\"/>\n\nBy the 19th century the fixed-blade utility knife had evolved into a steel-bladed outdoors field knife capable of butchering game, cutting wood, and preparing campfires and meals.  With the invention of the backspring, pocket-size utility knives were introduced{{when|date=July 2012}} with folding blades and other folding tools designed to increase the utility of the overall design.   The folding pocketknife and utility tool is typified by the ''Camper'' or ''Boy Scout'' pocketknife, the U.S. folding utility knife, the [[Swiss Army Knife]], and by [[multi-tool]]s fitted with knife blades.  The development of stronger locking blade mechanisms for folding knives&mdash;as with the Spanish [[navaja]], the [[Opinel]], and the [[Buck Knives|Buck 110 Folding Hunter]]{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}&mdash;significantly increased the utility of such knives when employed for heavy-duty tasks such as preparing game or cutting through dense or tough materials.\n\n==Contemporary utility knives==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:Stanley knife 1.jpg|thumb|right|A Stanley 99E utility knife, fully retracted]]\nThe fixed or folding blade utility knife is popular for both indoor and outdoor use.  One of the most popular types of workplace utility knife is the retractable or folding utility knife (also known as a ''Stanley knife'', ''box cutter'', ''X-Acto knife'', or by various other [[#Names|names]]).  These types of utility knives are designed as multi-purpose cutting [[tool]]s for use in a variety of trades and crafts. Designed to be lightweight and easy to carry and use, utility knives are commonly used in [[factory|factories]], warehouses, construction projects, and other situations where a tool is routinely needed to mark cut lines, trim plastic or wood materials, or to cut tape, cord, strapping, cardboard, or other packaging material.\n\n==Names==\nIn [[British English|British]], [[Australian English|Australian]] and [[New Zealand English]], along with [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Austrian German]], a utility knife frequently used in the construction industry is known as a ''Stanley knife''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanley knife| url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/246899?rskey=n8ldno&result=1&isAdvanced=false#|work=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=21 March 2011|quote=A knife made by the Stanley Works; esp. a small utility knife with a very fine and sharp replaceable blade, typically used in do-it-yourself and craft work.}}</ref>  This name is a [[genericised trademark]] named after [[Stanley Works]], a manufacturer of such knives. In Israel and Switzerland, these knives are known as ''Japanese knives''. In Brazil they are known as ''estiletes'' or ''cortadores [[Olfa]]'' (the latter, being another genericised trademark).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In Portugal and Canada they are also known as ''[[X-Acto]]'' (yet another [[genericised trademark]]). In India, the Philippines, France, Iraq, Italy, Egypt, and Germany, they are simply called ''cutter''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In the Flemish region of Belgium it is called ''cuttermes(je)'' (cutter knife). {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In general Spanish, they are known as ''cortaplumas'' (penknife, when it comes to folding blades);{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} in Spain, Mexico, and Costa Rica, they are colloquially known as ''cutters''; in Argentina and Uruguay the segmented fixed-blade knives are known as \"Trinchetas\".{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In Turkey, they are known as ''maket b\u0131\u00e7a\u011f\u0131'' (which literally translates as ''model knife'').<ref>{{cite web|title=make b\u0131\u00e7a\u011f\u0131| url=http://www.tdk.gov.tr/index.php?option=com_gts&arama=gts&kelime=maket%20b%C4%B1%C3%A7a%C4%9F%C4%B1|work=T\u00fcrk Dil Kurumu G\u00fcncel T\u00fcrk\u00e7e S\u00f6zl\u00fck|accessdate=24 November 2015|quote=Genellikle maket yap\u0131m\u0131nda kullan\u0131lan ince ve keskin b\u0131\u00e7ak.}}</ref>\n\nOther names for the tool are ''box cutter'' or ''boxcutter'', ''razor blade knife'', ''razor knife'', ''carpet knife'', ''pen knife'', ''stationery knife'', ''sheetrock knife'', or ''drywall knife''.\n\n==Design==\nUtility knives may use fixed, folding, or retractable or replaceable blades, and come in a wide variety of lengths and styles suited to the particular set of tasks they are designed to perform.  Thus, an outdoors utility knife suited for camping or hunting might use a broad {{convert|75|to(-)|130|mm|in|sigfig=1}} fixed blade, while a utility knife designed for the construction industry might feature a replaceable utility or razor blade for cutting packaging, cutting shingles, marking cut lines, or scraping paint.\n\n===Fixed blade utility knife===\n{{for|the kitchen knife|Kitchen knife#Utility}}\n[[File:X-Acto-knife.jpg|thumb|right|Fixed-blade [[X-Acto]] knife for handicrafts and model making.]]\n\nLarge fixed-blade utility knives are most often employed in an outdoors context, such as fishing, camping, or hunting.  Outdoor utility knives typically feature sturdy blades from {{convert|100|to(-)|150|mm|in|sigfig=1}} in length, with edge geometry designed to resist chipping and breakage.\n\nThe term \"utility knife\" may also refer to small fixed-blade knives used for crafts, model-making and other artisanal projects.  These small knives feature light-duty blades best suited for cutting thin, lightweight materials.  The small, thin blade and specialized handle permit cuts requiring a high degree of precision and control.\n\n===Workplace utility knives===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:Safety cutter and simple box cutter blades extended.jpg|thumb|A modern safety cutter at top, with blunted tip blade and cutting guide/tape hook. At bottom, an older style simple plastic box cutter using standard straight edged blades.]]\nThe largest construction or workplace utility knives typically feature retractable and replaceable blades, made of either [[die casting|die-cast metal]] or [[molding (process)|molded plastic]]. Some use standard [[razor]] blades, others specialized double-ended utility blades.  The user can adjust how far the blade extends from the handle, so that, for example, the knife can be used to cut the tape sealing a package without damaging the contents of the package. When the blade becomes dull, it can be quickly reversed or switched for a new one. Spare or used blades are stored in the hollow handle of some models, and can be accessed by removing a screw and opening the handle.  Other models feature a quick-change mechanism that allows replacing the blade without tools, as well as a flip-out blade storage tray.  The blades for this type of utility knife come in both double- and single-ended versions, and are interchangeable with many, but not all, of the later copies. Specialized blades also exist for cutting string, linoleum, and other materials.\n\n[[File:Box-cutter.jpg|thumb|right|Segmented blade or \"snap-off blade\" utility knife]]\nAnother style is a snap-off utility knife that contains a long, segmented blade that slides out from it. As the endmost edge becomes dull, it can be broken off the remaining blade, exposing the next section, which is sharp and ready for use. The snapping is best accomplished with a blade snapper that is often built-in, or a pair of pliers, and the break occurs at the score lines, where the metal is thinnest. When all of the individual segments are used, the knife may be thrown away, or, more often, refilled with a replacement blade. This design was introduced by Japanese manufacturer [[Olfa]] Corporation in 1956 as the world's first snap-off blade and was inspired from analyzing the sharp cutting edge produced when glass is broken and how pieces of a chocolate bar break into segments.\n\n[[File:BoxCutter.jpg|thumb|right|Inexpensive stamped steel and aluminum box cutter with disposable razor blade.]]\nAnother utility knife often used for cutting open boxes consists of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which [[Razor#Other razors|single-edge utility blades]] can be inserted.  The sleeve slides up and down on the handle, holding the blade in place during use and covering the blade when not in use.  The blade holder may either retract or fold into the handle, much like a folding-blade pocketknife.  The blade holder is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of [[corrugated fiberboard]], to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes.\n\n==Use as weapon==\n{{see also|Airport security repercussions due to the September 11 attacks}}\nMost utility knives are not well suited to use as offensive weapons, with the exception of some outdoor-type utility knives employing longer blades.  However, even small razor-blade type utility knives may sometimes find use as slashing weapons. The [[9/11 Commission|9-11 commission]] report stated passengers in cell phone calls reported knives or \"box-cutters\" were used as weapons, (also Mace or a bomb),  in hi-jacking airplanes in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] against the United States, though the exact design of the knives used is unknown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|website=www.9-11commission.gov|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf|title=The 9/11 Commission report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Two of the hijackers were known to have purchased [[Leatherman]] knives, which feature a 4\" locking blade which were not prohibited on U.S. flights at the time.

Also, [[Arsenic poisoning|unlike arsenic]], metallic tin and fumes from tin refining are [[Tin poisoning|not toxic]].

[[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]] had a major influence on the development of cultures.  In Europe, a major source of tin was the British deposits of ore in [[Cornwall]], which were traded as far as [[Phoenicia]] in the eastern [[Mediterranean]].\n\nIn many parts of the world, large hoards of bronze artifacts are found, suggesting that bronze also represented a store of value and an indicator of social status.  In Europe, large hoards of bronze tools, typically socketed axes (illustrated above), are found, which mostly show no signs of wear. With [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s, which are documented in the inscriptions they carry and from other sources, the case is very clear. These were made in enormous quantities for elite burials, and also used by the living for ritual offerings.\n\n===Transition to iron===\nThough bronze is generally harder than [[wrought iron]], with [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers hardness]] of 60\u2013258 vs. 30\u201380,<ref>''Smithells Metals Reference Book'', 8th Edition, ch. 22</ref> the [[Bronze Age]] gave way to the [[Iron Age]] after a serious disruption of the tin trade: the population migrations of around 1200\u20131100 BC reduced the shipping of tin around the Mediterranean and from Britain, limiting supplies and raising prices.<ref>Clayton E.

(1996) ''Copper, Silver and Gold''. Reed Library, Australia.</ref> '''Alpha bronze'''  consists of the alpha [[solid solution]] of tin in copper. Alpha bronze alloys of 4\u20135% tin are used to make [[coin]]s, [[spring (device)|springs]], [[turbine]]s and [[blade]]s. Historical \"bronzes\" are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was on hand; the metal of the 12th-century English [[Gloucester Candlestick]] is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver \u2013 between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture suggests that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins.  The [[Benin Bronzes]] are in fact brass, and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge]] is described as both bronze and brass.\n\nIn the Bronze Age, two forms of bronze were commonly used: \"classic bronze\", about 10% tin, was used in casting; and \"mild bronze\", about 6% tin, was hammered from ingots to make sheets. Bladed weapons were mostly cast from classic bronze, while helmets and armor were hammered from mild bronze.\n\nCommercial bronze (90% copper and 10% zinc) and architectural bronze (57% copper, 3% [[lead]], 40% zinc) are more properly regarded as [[brass]] alloys because they contain [[zinc]] as the main alloying ingredient. They are commonly used in architectural applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/copper_alloys/intro.html|title=Copper alloys|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911022109/http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/copper_alloys/intro.html|archivedate=11 September 2013|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/standard-designations/introduction.html|title=CDA UNS Standard Designations for Wrought and Cast Copper and Copper Alloys: Introduction|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924132326/http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/standard-designations/introduction.html|archivedate=24 September 2013|df=}}</ref>\n\n[[Bismuth bronze]] is a bronze alloy with a composition of 52% copper, 30% nickel, 12% zinc, 5% lead, and 1% bismuth.

Typically bronze only oxidizes superficially; once a copper oxide (eventually becoming copper carbonate) layer is formed, the underlying metal is [[Passivation (chemistry)|protected from further corrosion]]. This can be seen on statues from the Hellenistic period. However, if copper chlorides are formed, a corrosion-mode called \"[[bronze disease]]\" will eventually completely destroy it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://proteus.brown.edu/greekpast/4867|title=Bronze Disease, Archaeologies of the Greek Past|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Copper-based [[alloy]]s have lower [[melting point]]s than steel or iron and are more readily produced from their constituent metals. They are generally about 10 percent denser than steel, although alloys using [[aluminium]] or [[silicon]] may be slightly less dense. Bronze is a better conductor of heat and electricity than most steels. The cost of copper-base alloys is generally higher than that of steels but lower than that of [[nickel]]-base alloys.\n\nCopper and its alloys have a huge variety of uses that reflect their versatile physical, mechanical, and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Some common examples are the high [[electrical conductivity]] of pure copper, low-friction properties of bearing bronze (bronze which has a high lead content\u2014 6\u20138%), resonant qualities of bell bronze (20% tin, 80% copper), and resistance to corrosion by [[seawater]] of several bronze alloys.\n\nThe melting point of bronze varies depending on the ratio of the alloy components and is about {{convert|950|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Bronze is usually nonmagnetic, but certain alloys containing iron or nickel may have magnetic properties.\n\n===Varieties of fitness===\nBronze, or bronze-like alloys and mixtures, were used for coins over a longer period. Bronze was especially suitable for use in boat and ship fittings prior to the wide employment of [[stainless steel]] owing to its combination of toughness and resistance to salt water corrosion. Bronze is still commonly used in ship propellers and submerged bearings.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[silicon]] was introduced as the primary alloying element, creating an alloy with wide application in industry and the major form used in contemporary [[statuary]]. Sculptors may prefer silicon bronze because of the ready availability of silicon bronze brazing rod, which allows colour-matched repair of defects in castings. Aluminium is also used for the structural metal [[aluminium bronze]].\n\nIt is also widely used for casting [[bronze sculpture]]s. Many common bronze alloys have the unusual and very desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling in the finest details of a [[molding (process)|mould]]. Bronze parts are [[Toughness|tough]] and typically used for [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], clips, [[electrical connector]]s and [[Spring (device)|springs]].\n\nBronze also has very low [[friction]] against dissimilar metals, making it important for [[cannon]]s prior to modern [[Engineering tolerance|tolerancing]], where iron cannonballs would otherwise stick in the barrel.<ref name=\"AlavudeenVenkateshwaran2006\">{{cite book|author1=A.

It is the central administrative pillar of the Benelux Union. It handles the secretariat of the Committee of Ministers, the Council of Economic Union and the various committees and working parties.\n\n== Politics ==\n[[File:Terras van het Catshuis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Prime Ministers [[Mark Rutte]] (Netherlands), [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] (Luxembourg) and [[Yves Leterme]] (Belgium) in [[The Hague]] on 24 May 2011]]\nA [[Benelux Parliament]] (originally referred to as an \"Interparliamentary Consultative Council\") was created in 1955. This [[International parliament|parliamentary assembly]] is composed of 21 members of the Dutch parliament, 21 members of the Belgian national and regional parliaments, and 7 members of the Luxembourg parliament.\n\nIn 1944, exiled representatives of the three countries signed the [[London Customs Convention]], the treaty that established the Benelux Customs Union. Ratified in 1947, the treaty was in force from 1948 until it was superseded by the Benelux Economic Union. The treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union (''Benelux Economische Unie/Union \u00c9conomique Benelux'') was signed on 3 February 1958 in [[The Hague]] and came into force on 1 November 1960 to promote the free movement of workers, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], [[Service (economics)|services]], and [[goods]] in the region. Under the Treaty the Union implies the co-operation of economic, financial and social policies.\n\n===Cooperation with other Geopolitic-regions===\nIn 2017 the members of the Benelux, the [[Baltic Assembly]], and three members of the [[Nordic Council]] ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]], all [[Member state of the European Union|EU-member states]]), sought intensifying cooperation in the [[Digital Single Market]], as well as discussing social matters, the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], the [[European migrant crisis]] and defense cooperation. Relations with [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia]], [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|Turkey]] and the [[Brexit|United Kingdom]] was also on the agenda.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague|title=Ratas meets with Benelux, Nordic, Baltic leaders in the Hague|first=|last=ERR|date=22 June 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Law ==\n[[File:Benelux conference The Hague March 1949-102.jpg|thumb|Meeting of Benelux delegates in [[The Hague]], 1949]]\nThe Benelux Union involves an intergovernmental co-operation.<ref>https://www.urm.lt/default/en/foreign-policy/lithuania-in-the-region-and-the-world/regional-cooperation/intergovernmental-cooperation-of-the-baltic-and-the-benelux-countries</ref>\n\nThe unification of the law of the three Benelux countries is mainly achieved by regulations of its Committee of Ministers, that only bind the three states, but are not directly applicable in their internal legal orders.{{clarify|date=November 2015}} They only become legally valid after having been incorporated into national law, with the exception of Belgium. The [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Belgian Court of Cassation]] decided in 1971 that any self-executing treaties have priority over laws by the Belgian parliament.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1971|title=Cass. 27 mei 1971, Franco-Suisse Le Ski|url=|journal=Pasicrisie|volume=I|pages=886|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe Treaty establishing the Benelux Union has provided the Committee of Ministers with the following legal instruments: decisions, conventions, recommendations and directives.\n\nThe Committee of Ministers can promulgate decisions in the fields for which it has competence - those fields are explicitly set down in the Union Treaty or the additional conventions. When the Committee of Ministers adopts a decision, it immediately becomes binding on the three governments. For a decision to be also applicable to the citizen, it must be transposed into national law.\n\nThe Union Treaty is not exhaustive. For this reason, Article 19 of the Treaty provides that the Committee of Ministers may conclude additional conventions. These therefore constitute extensions of the Union Treaty. They are submitted to the national parliaments for approval in keeping with the ratification procedure applied in each of the Member States. Thus there are a large number of Benelux conventions in a wide range of subject matters.<ref name=\"benelux-nutshell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.benelux.be/en/bnl/bnl_instellingen.asp|title=Benelux in a nutshell|publisher=General Secretariat of the Benelux|accessdate=3 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118043116/http://www.benelux.be/en/bnl/bnl_instellingen.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=18 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, the treaty establishing a Benelux Court of Justice was signed.

The three countries established a Benelux Trademarks Office and a Benelux Designs Office, both situated in [[The Hague]]. In 2005, they concluded a treaty establishing a ''[[Benelux Office for Intellectual Property|Benelux Organisation for Intellectual Property]]'' which replaced both offices upon its entry into force on 1 September 2006. This Organisation is the official body for the registration of trademarks and designs in the Benelux.

During the following years, and even more so after the creation of the European Union, the Benelux cooperation focused on developing other fields of activity within a constantly changing international context.\n\nAt the end of the 50 years, the governments of the three Benelux countries decided to renew the agreement, taking into account the new aspects of the Benelux-cooperation \u2013 such as security \u2013 and the new [[federal government]] structure of Belgium. The original establishing treaty, set to expire in 2010, was replaced by a new legal framework (called the Treaty revising the Treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union), which was signed on 17 June 2008.\n\nThe new treaty has no set time limit and the name of the ''Benelux Economic Union'' changed to ''Benelux Union'' to reflect the broad scope on the union.<ref>[http://www.benelux.be/en/act/act_nieuwVerdrag.asp Benelux union] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001023203/http://www.benelux.be/en/act/act_nieuwVerdrag.asp |date=1 October 2009 }}</ref>  The main objectives of the treaty are the continuation and enlargement of the cooperation between the three member states within a larger European context. The renewed treaty explicitly foresees the possibility that the Benelux countries will cooperate with other European member States or with regional cooperation structures. The new Benelux cooperation focuses on three main topics: internal market and economic union, sustainability, justice and internal affairs. The number of structures in the renewed Treaty has been reduced and thus simplified. Five Benelux institutions remain: the Benelux Committee of Ministers, the Benelux Council, the Benelux Parliament, the Benelux Court of Justice, the Benelux Secretariat General. Beside these five institutions, the Benelux Organisation for Intellectual Property is also present in this Treaty.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[EU Med Group]]\n* [[Baltic Assembly]]\n* [[Inner Six]]\n* [[Low Countries]]\n* [[Nordic Council]]\n* [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]\n* [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Benelux}}\n{{wikivoyage|Benelux}}\n; Official sites\n* [http://www.benelux.int/fr Benelux official site] (in French)\n* [http://www.benelux-parlement.eu/ Benelux Parliament]\n* [http://www.courbeneluxhof.be/ Benelux Court of Justice]\n* [http://www.boip.int/en/homepage.php Benelux Office for Intellectual Property]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Benelux| ]]\n[[Category:Regions of Europe]]\n[[Category:History of the Low Countries]]\n[[Category:Economic history of Belgium]]\n[[Category:Economic history of Luxembourg]]\n[[Category:Economic history of the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:1944 establishments in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:1944 establishments in Belgium]]\n[[Category:1944 establishments in Luxembourg]]\n[[Category:International economic organizations]]\n[[Category:Supranational unions]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1944]]", "sha1": "mi0bl16v1ur7f4yl2tduyiebk4dl9rn"}}, {"title": "Boston Herald", "ns": "0", "id": "4171", "revision": {"id": "863978601", "parentid": "862645342", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T09:13:04Z", "contributor": {"ip": "174.255.195.124"}, "comment": "/* Columnists */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2016}}\n{{Infobox newspaper\n| name = Boston Herald\n| logo = Boston-herald.svg\n| logo_size=225px\n| image = Boston Herald (cover).jpg\n| image_size=283px\n| caption =\n| type = [[Daily newspaper]]\n| format = [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid]]\n| foundation = 1846\n| owners = [[Digital First Media]]\n| publisher = Kevin Corrado<ref name=march19/>\n| editor = Joe Sciacca\n| circulation = 40,000 weekdays in 2018<br />73,913 Saturdays in Q1\u20132 FY2013<br />45,833  Sundays\n| headquarters =  70 Fargo Street<br />[[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] 02210<br />[[United States]]\n| website = [http://www.bostonherald.com/ www.BostonHerald.com]\n| ISSN = 0738-5854\n|}}\n\nThe '''''Boston Herald''''' is an American [[daily newspaper]] whose primary market is [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] and its surrounding area.

French & Company. The paper was published as a single two-sided sheet, selling for one cent. Its first editor, [[William O. Eaton]], just 22 years old, said \"The ''Herald'' will be independent in politics and religion; liberal, industrious, enterprising, critically concerned with literacy and dramatic matters, and diligent in its mission to report and analyze the news, local and global.\"\n\nIn 1847, the ''Boston Herald'' absorbed the Boston ''American Eagle'' and the Boston ''Daily Times''.<ref>{{Citation | last = King | first = Moses | title =  King's Hand-book of Boston ...: Profusely Illustrated |  pages = 268\u2013269| publisher = ''Moses King'' | location = Cambridge, Ma | year = 1881}}</ref>\n\n===''The Boston Herald and Boston Journal''===\nIn October 1917, John H.

For many years, the newspaper was controlled by many of the investors in United Shoe Machinery Co. After a newspaper strike in 1967, Herald-Traveler Corp. suspended the afternoon ''Traveler'' and absorbed the evening edition into the Herald to create the ''Boston Herald Traveler.''\n\n===''The Boston Daily Advertiser''===\n[[Image:Boston Advertiser Building.png|thumb|right| The old ''Boston Advertiser'' Building]]\nThe ''Boston Daily Advertiser'' was established in 1813 in Boston by [[Nathan Hale (journalist)|Nathan Hale]]. The paper grew to prominence throughout the 19th century, taking over other Boston area papers. In 1832 The Advertiser took over control of ''The Boston Patriot'', and then in 1840 it took over and absorbed ''The Boston Gazette''.<ref>{{Citation | title =  The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |  volume = 19|  page = 567| publisher = ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' | location = New York, NY | year = 1911}}</ref> The paper was purchased by [[William Randolph Hearst]] in 1917. In 1920 the ''Advertiser'' was merged with ''The Boston Record'', initially the combined newspaper was called the ''Boston Advertiser'' however when the combined newspaper became an illustrated tabloid in 1921 it was renamed ''The Boston American''.<ref>{{Citation | first = Frederic | last = Hudson | title =  American Journalism, 1690-1940 | pages = 661\u2013662| publisher = ''Routledge'' | location = New York, N.Y. | year = 2000 | ISBN=0-415-22894-8 }}</ref>  Hearst Corp. continued using the name ''Advertiser'' for its Sunday paper until the early 1970s.\n\n===''The Boston Record''===\nOn September 3, 1884, ''The Boston Evening Record'' was started by the ''Boston Advertiser'' as a campaign newspaper. The ''Record'' was so popular that it was made a permanent publication.<ref name=\"Stanwood 1886 104\" />\n\n===''The Boston American''===\nIn 1904, William Randolph Hearst began publishing his own newspaper in Boston called ''The American''. Hearst ultimately ended up purchasing the ''Daily Advertiser'' in 1917. By 1938, the ''Daily Advertiser'' had changed to the ''Daily Record'', and ''The American'' had become the ''Sunday Advertiser''. A third paper owned by Hearst, called the ''Afternoon Record'', which had been renamed the ''Evening American'', merged in 1961 with the ''Daily Record'' to form the ''Record American''. The ''Sunday Advertiser'' and ''Record American'' would ultimately be merged in 1972 into ''The Boston Herald Traveler'' a line of newspapers that stretched back to the old ''Boston Herald''.\n\n===''The Boston Herald Traveler''===\nIn 1946, Herald-Traveler Corporation acquired Boston radio station [[WEEI (AM)|WHDH]]. Two years later, WHDH-FM was licensed, and on November 26, 1957, [[WHDH-TV (defunct)|WHDH-TV]] made its d\u00e9but as an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate on channel 5. In 1961, WHDH-TV's affiliation switched to [[CBS]]. Herald-Traveler Corp. operated for years under temporary authority from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] stemming from controversy over luncheon meetings the newspaper's chief executive had with an FCC commissioner during the original licensing process. (Some Boston broadcast historians accuse ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' of being covertly behind the proceeding. The ''Herald Traveler'' was Republican in sympathies, and the ''Globe'' then had a firm policy of not endorsing political candidates.) The FCC ordered comparative hearings, and in 1969 a competing applicant, Boston Broadcasters, Inc., was granted a construction permit to replace WHDH-TV on channel 5. Herald-Traveler Corp. fought the decision in court\u2014by this time, revenues from channel 5 were all but keeping the newspaper afloat\u2014but its final appeal ran out in 1972, and on March 19 WHDH-TV was forced to surrender channel 5 to the new [[WCVB-TV]].\n\n===''The Boston Herald Traveler and Record American''===\nWithout a television station to subsidize the newspaper, the ''Herald Traveler'' was no longer able to remain in business, and the newspaper was sold to [[Hearst Corporation]], which published the rival all-day newspaper, the ''Record American''. The two papers were merged to become an all-day paper called the ''Boston Herald Traveler and Record American'' in the morning and ''Record-American and Boston Herald Traveler'' in the afternoon. The first editions published under the new combined name were those of June 19, 1972. The afternoon edition was soon dropped and the unwieldy name shortened to ''Boston Herald American'', with the Sunday edition called the ''Sunday Herald Advertiser''. The ''Herald American'' was printed in [[broadsheet]] format, and failed to target a particular readership; where the ''Record American'' had been a typical city [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], the ''Herald Traveler'' was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] paper.\n\n===Murdoch purchases ''The Herald American''===\nThe ''Herald American'' converted to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format in September 1981, but Hearst faced steep declines in circulation and advertising. The company announced it would close the ''Herald American''\u2014making Boston a one-newspaper town\u2014on December 3, 1982. When the deadline came, Australian media baron [[Rupert Murdoch]] was negotiating to buy the paper and save it. He closed on the deal after 30 hours of talks with Hearst and newspaper unions\u2014and five hours after Hearst had sent out notices to newsroom employees telling them they were terminated. The newspaper announced its own survival the next day with a full-page headline: \"You Bet We're Alive!\"<ref name=\"NEPA\">\"Purcell Toasts 25th Anniversary of Herald's Survival\".

The ''Herald'' continued to grow, expanding its coverage and increasing its circulation until 2001, when nearly all newspapers fell victim to declining circulations and revenue.\n\n===Independent ownership===\nIn February 1994, Murdoch's [[News Corporation]] was forced to sell the paper, in order that its subsidiary [[Fox Television Stations]] could legally consummate its purchase of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WFXT-TV|WFXT]] (Channel 25) because Massachusetts Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] included language in an appropriations barring one company from owning a newspaper and television station in the same market.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Allan R.|title=Kennedy vs. Murdoch: Test of Motives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/11/us/kennedy-vs-murdoch-test-of-motives.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=November 22, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 11, 1988}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Allan R.|title=Kennedy and Paper Battle in Boston|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/07/us/kennedy-and-paper-battle-in-boston.html|accessdate=November 22, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 7, 1988}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lenzner|first=Robert|title=Rupert Murdoch,The Boston Globe, And Me|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2011/08/06/rupert-murdochthe-boston-globe-and-me/|work=Forbes|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}</ref>  [[Patrick J. Purcell]], who was the publisher of the ''Boston Herald'' and a former [[News Corporation]] executive, purchased the ''Herald'' and established it as an independent newspaper. Several years later, Purcell would give the ''Herald'' a suburban presence it never had by purchasing the money-losing [[Community Newspaper Company]] from [[Fidelity Investments]]. Although the companies merged under the banner of Herald Media, Inc., the suburban papers maintained their distinct editorial and marketing identity.\n\nAfter years of operating profits at Community Newspaper and losses at the ''Herald'', Purcell in 2006 sold the suburban chain to newspaper conglomerate Liberty Group Publishing of Illinois, which soon after changed its name to [[GateHouse Media]]. The deal, which also saw GateHouse acquiring ''[[The Patriot Ledger]]'' and ''[[The Enterprise (Brockton)|The Enterprise]]'' respectively in south suburban [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] and [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]], netted $225 million for Purcell, who vowed to use the funds to clear the ''Herald''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> debt and reinvest in the Paper.<ref>Bailey, Steve, and Robert Gavin.

Nicknamed \"'''The Bambino'''\" and \"'''The Sultan of Swat'''\", he began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed [[pitcher]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]], but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging [[outfielder]] for the [[New York Yankees]]. Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including career [[home run]]s (714), [[runs batted in]] (RBIs) (2,213), [[bases on balls]] (2,062), [[slugging percentage]] (.690), and [[on-base plus slugging]] (OPS) (1.164); the latter two still stand as of 2018.<ref name = \"99facts\" /> Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. In 1936, Ruth was elected into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] as one of its [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|\"first five\"]] inaugural members.\n\nAt age seven, Ruth was sent to [[Cardinal Gibbons School (Baltimore, Maryland)|St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys]], a [[Reform school|reformatory]] where he learned life lessons and baseball skills from Brother Matthias Boutlier of the [[Xaverian Brothers]], the school's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play [[Minor League Baseball|minor-league]] baseball for the [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]] but was soon sold to the Red Sox. By 1916, he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs, a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 [[dead-ball era]]. Although Ruth twice [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|won]] 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three [[World Series]] championship teams with the Red Sox, he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder. With regular playing time, he broke the [[List of Major League Baseball progressive single-season home run leaders|MLB single-season home run record]] in 1919.\n\nAfter that season, Red Sox owner [[Harry Frazee]] sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy. The trade fueled Boston's subsequent 86 year championship drought and popularized the \"[[Curse of the Bambino]]\" superstition. In his 15 years with the Yankees, Ruth helped the team win seven [[List of American League pennant winners|American League (AL) pennants]] and four World Series championships. His big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sport's popularity but also helped usher in baseball's [[live-ball era]], which evolved from a low-scoring game of strategy to a sport where the home run was a major factor. As part of the Yankees' vaunted \"[[Murderers' Row]]\" lineup of 1927, Ruth hit 60 home runs, which extended his MLB single-season record by a single home run. Ruth's last season with the Yankees was 1934; he retired from the game the following year, after a short stint with the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. During his career, Ruth led the AL in home runs during a season twelve times.\n\nRuth's legendary power and charismatic personality made him a larger-than-life figure during the [[Roaring Twenties]]. During his career, he was the target of intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages. After his retirement as a player, he was denied the opportunity to manage a major league club, most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career. In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, he became ill with [[esophageal cancer]] and died two years later as a result of the disease.\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Babe Ruth Birthplace.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Babe Ruth's birthplace in Baltimore, Maryland is now a museum]]\nGeorge Herman Ruth Jr. was born in 1895 at 216 Emory Street in the [[Pigtown, Baltimore|Pigtown]] section of [[Baltimore]], Maryland. Ruth's parents, George Herman Ruth Sr. and Katherine Schamberger, were both of [[German Americans|German ancestry]]. According to the 1880 census, his parents were born in Maryland. His paternal grandparents were from Prussia and Hanover. Ruth Sr. worked a series of jobs that included [[lightning rod]] salesman and [[streetcar]] operator. The elder Ruth then became a counterman in a family-owned combination grocery and saloon business on Frederick Street. George Ruth Jr. was born in the house of his maternal grandfather, Pius Schamberger, a German immigrant and trade unionist.<ref>Creamer, pp. 24\u201325</ref><ref>Smelser pp. 5\u20138</ref> Only one of young George's seven siblings, his younger sister Mamie, survived infancy.<ref>Smelser, pp. 7\u20139</ref>\n\nMany details of Ruth's childhood are unknown, including the date of his parents' marriage.<ref>Creamer, p. 11</ref> As a child, Ruth spoke [[German language|German]].<ref>{{citation|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Sowell|title=Migrations and Cultures: A World View|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|place=[[New York City|New York]]|year=1996|page=82|quote=...it may be indicative of how long German cultural ties endured [in the United States] that the German language was spoken in childhood by such disparate twentieth-century American figures as famed writer [[H. L. Mencken]], baseball stars Babe Ruth and [[Lou Gehrig]], and by the Nobel Prize-winning economist [[George Stigler]].}}</ref> When young George was a toddler, the family moved to 339 South Woodyear Street, not far from the rail yards; by the time the boy was 6, his father had a saloon with an upstairs apartment at 426 West Camden Street. Details are equally scanty about why young George was sent at the age of 7 to [[Cardinal Gibbons School (Baltimore, Maryland)|St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys]], a reformatory and orphanage. As an adult, Babe Ruth reminisced that as a youth he had been running the streets and rarely attending school, as well was drinking beer when his father was not looking. Some accounts say that following a violent incident at his father's saloon, the city authorities decided that this environment was unsuitable for a small child. George, Jr. entered St. Mary's on June 13, 1902. He was recorded as \"incorrigible\" and spent much of the next twelve years there.<ref>Wagenheim, pp. 13\u201314</ref><ref>Creamer, pp. 29\u201331</ref><ref>Montville, pp. 8\u201311</ref>\n\n[[File:Babe Ruth - St. Mary's Industrial School.JPG|thumb|left|Ruth (top row, center) at St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1912]]\nAlthough St. Mary's boys received an education, students were also expected to learn work skills and help operate the school, particularly once the boys turned 12. Ruth became a shirtmaker and was also proficient as a carpenter. He would adjust his own shirt collars, rather than having a tailor do so, even during his well-paid baseball career. The boys, aged 5 to 21, did most work around the facility, from cooking to shoemaking, and renovated St. Mary's in 1912. The food was simple, and the [[Xaverian Brothers]] who ran the school insisted on strict discipline; corporal punishment was common. Ruth's nickname there was \"Niggerlips\", as he had large facial features and was darker than most boys at the all-white reformatory.<ref>Montville, pp. 19\u201323</ref>\n\nRuth was sometimes allowed to rejoin his family or was placed at St. James's Home, a supervised residence with work in the community, but he was always returned to St. Mary's.<ref>Creamer, pp. 39\u201340</ref><ref>Wagenheim, p. 14</ref> He  was rarely visited by his family; his mother died when he was 12 and by some accounts, he was permitted to leave St. Mary's only to attend the funeral.<ref>Creamer, p. 32</ref> How Ruth came to play baseball there is uncertain: according to one account, his placement at St. Mary's was due in part to repeatedly breaking Baltimore's windows with long [[hit (baseball)|hits]] while playing [[stickball|street ball]]; by another, he was told to join a team on his first day at St. Mary's by the school's athletic director, Brother Herman, becoming a [[catcher]] even though left-handers rarely play that position. During his time there he also played [[third base]] and [[shortstop]], again unusual for a left-hander, and was forced to wear mitts and gloves made for right-handers. He was encouraged in his pursuits by the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of [[Nova Scotia]]. A large man, Brother Matthias was greatly respected by the boys both for his strength and for his fairness. For the rest of his life, Ruth would praise Brother Matthias, and his running and hitting styles closely resembled his teacher's.<ref>Creamer, pp. 35\u201337.</ref><ref>Montville, pp. 24\u201326</ref> Ruth stated, \"I think I was born as a hitter the first day I ever saw him hit a baseball.\"<ref name=\"c37\">Creamer, p. 37</ref> The older man became a mentor and role model to George; biographer [[Robert W. Creamer]] commented on the closeness between the two:\n\n[[File:Babe Ruth - St. Mary's Industrial School 1912.jpg|thumb|right|Ruth (top row, left, holding a catcher's mitt and mask) at St. Mary's, 1912]]\n{{quote |\nRuth revered Brother Matthias&nbsp;... which is remarkable, considering that Matthias was in charge of making boys behave and that Ruth was one of the great natural misbehavers of all time.&nbsp;... George Ruth caught Brother Matthias' attention early, and the calm, considerable attention the big man gave the young hellraiser from the waterfront struck a spark of response in the boy's soul&nbsp;... [that may have] blunted a few of the more savage teeth in the gross man whom I have heard at least a half-dozen of his baseball contemporaries describe with admiring awe and wonder as \"an animal.\"<ref name=\"c37\" />\n}}\n\nThe school's influence remained with Ruth in other ways. He was a lifelong [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] who would sometimes attend Mass after carousing all night, and he became a well-known member of the [[Knights of Columbus]]. He would visit orphanages, schools, and hospitals throughout his life, often avoiding publicity.<ref>Reisler, p. 22</ref> He was generous to St. Mary's as he became famous and rich, donating money and his presence at fundraisers, and spending $5,000 to buy Brother Matthias a Cadillac in 1926\u2014subsequently replacing it when it was destroyed in an accident.<ref>Montville, pp. 28\u201329</ref>\n\nMost of the boys at St. Mary's played baseball in organized leagues at different levels of proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions at one time or another (including [[infield]] positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a [[pitcher]]. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long [[home run]]s.<ref>Montville, pp. 26\u201328</ref><ref>Wagenheim, p. 17</ref>\n\n==Professional baseball==\n\n===Minor league, Baltimore Orioles===\nIn early 1914, Ruth signed a professional baseball contract with [[Jack Dunn (baseball)|Jack Dunn]], who owned and managed the [[Minor League Baseball|minor-league]] [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]], an [[International League]] team. The circumstances of Ruth's signing are not known with certainty; historical fact is obscured by stories that cannot all be true. By some accounts, Dunn was urged to attend a game between an all-star team from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, [[Mount St. Mary's University|Mount St. Mary's College]]. Some versions have Ruth running away before the eagerly awaited game, to return in time to be punished, and then pitching St. Mary's to victory as Dunn watched. Others have [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] pitcher [[Joe Engel]], a Mount St. Mary's graduate, pitching in an alumni game after watching a preliminary contest between the college's freshmen and a team from St. Mary's, including Ruth. Engel watched Ruth play, then told Dunn about him at a chance meeting in Washington. Ruth, in his autobiography, stated only that he worked out for Dunn for a half-hour, and was signed.<ref>Creamer, pp. 48\u201351</ref> According to biographer Kal Wagenheim, there were legal difficulties to be straightened out as Ruth was supposed to remain at the school until he turned 21.{{efn|Ruth long thought his birthday was February 7, 1894. This was, in fact, the birthday of an elder brother of the same name, who died soon after birth. Ruth learned this when he needed a passport in 1934.}}<ref>Wagenheim, pp. 19.</ref>\n\n[[File:1914 Babe Ruth baseball card.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Baseball card]] showing Ruth as a [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Oriole]], 1914]]\nThe train journey to spring training in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], in early March was likely Ruth's first outside the Baltimore area.<ref>Wagenheim, pp. 20\u201321</ref> The rookie ballplayer was the subject of various pranks by the veterans, who were probably also the source of his famous nickname. There are various accounts of how Ruth came to be called Babe, but most center on his being referred to as \"Dunnie's babe\" or a variant. \"Babe\" was at that time a common nickname in baseball, with perhaps the most famous to that point being [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] pitcher and [[1909 World Series]] hero [[Babe Adams]], who appeared younger than he was.<ref>Montville, p. 36</ref><ref>Wagenheim, p. 22</ref>\n\nRuth made his first appearance as a professional ballplayer in an inter-squad game on March 7, 1914. He played shortstop and pitched the last two [[inning]]s of a 15\u20139 victory. In his second at-bat, Ruth hit a long home run to right field; the blast was locally reported to be longer than a legendary shot hit by [[Jim Thorpe]] in Fayetteville.<ref>Creamer, pp. 61\u201362</ref> Ruth made his first appearance against a team in [[organized baseball]] in an exhibition game versus the major-league [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. Ruth pitched the middle three innings and gave up two runs in the fourth, but then settled down and pitched a scoreless fifth and sixth innings. In a game against the Phillies the following afternoon, Ruth entered during the sixth inning and did not allow a run the rest of the way. The Orioles scored seven runs in the bottom of the eighth inning to overcome a 6\u20130 deficit, and Ruth was the winning pitcher.<ref>Creamer, pp. 66\u201367</ref>\n\nOnce the regular season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also dangerous at the plate. The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A third major league, the [[Federal League]], had begun play, and the local franchise, the [[Baltimore Terrapins]], restored that city to the major leagues for the first time since 1902. Few fans visited [[Oriole Park]], where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity. Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn.<ref>Creamer, pp. 72\u201377</ref><ref>Montville, pp. 38\u201340</ref>\n\nThe competition from the Terrapins caused Dunn to sustain large losses. Although by late June the Orioles were in first place, having won over two-thirds of their games, the paid attendance dropped as low as 150. Dunn explored a possible move by the Orioles to [[Richmond, Virginia]], as well as the sale of a minority interest in the club. These possibilities fell through, leaving Dunn with little choice other than to sell his best players to major league teams to raise money.<ref>Creamer, pp. 78\u201380.</ref> He offered Ruth to the reigning [[World Series]] champions, [[Connie Mack]]'s [[Philadelphia Athletics]], but Mack had his own financial problems.<ref>Wagenheim, p. 26.</ref> The [[Cincinnati Reds]] and [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] expressed interest in Ruth, but Dunn sold his contract, along with those of pitchers [[Ernie Shore]] and [[Ben Egan]], to the [[Boston Red Sox]] of the [[American League]] (AL) on July 4. The sale price was announced as $25,000 but other reports lower the amount to half that, or possibly $8,500 plus the cancellation of a $3,000 loan. Ruth remained with the Orioles for several days while the Red Sox completed a road trip, and reported to the team in Boston on July 11.<ref>Montville, pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\n===Boston Red Sox (1914\u20131919)===\n\n====Developing star====\n[[File:Babe Ruth Boston pitching.jpg|thumb|right|Ruth pitching for the Boston Red Sox]]\nOn July 11, 1914, Ruth arrived in Boston with Egan and Shore. Ruth later told the story of how that morning he had met Helen Woodford, who was the girl that would be his first wife. She was a 16-year-old waitress at Landers Coffee Shop, and Ruth related that she served him when he had breakfast there. Other stories, though, suggested that the meeting occurred on another day, and perhaps under other circumstances. Regardless of when he began to woo his first wife, he won his first game as a pitcher for the Red Sox that afternoon, 4\u20133, over the [[Cleveland Naps]]. His catcher was [[Bill Carrigan]], who was also the Red Sox manager. Shore was given a [[Starting pitcher|start]] by Carrigan the next day; he won that and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly. Ruth lost his second start, and was thereafter little used.<ref name=\"debut\" /> In his major league debut as a batter, Ruth went [[batting average|0-for-2]] against left-hander [[Willie Mitchell (baseball)|Willie Mitchell]], [[Strikeout|striking out]] in his first [[at bat]], before being removed for a [[pinch hitter]] in the seventh inning.<ref>Creamer, p. 87</ref> Ruth was not much noticed by the fans, as Bostonians watched the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Braves]], begin [[1914 Boston Braves season|a legendary comeback]] that would take them from last place on the Fourth of July to the [[1914 World Series]] championship.<ref name=\"debut\">Montville, pp. 41\u201344</ref>\n\nEgan was traded to Cleveland after two weeks on the Boston roster. During his time as a Red Sox, he kept an eye on the inexperienced Ruth, much as Dunn had in Baltimore. When he was traded, no one took his place as supervisor. Ruth's new teammates considered him brash, and would have preferred him, as a rookie, to remain quiet and inconspicuous. When Ruth insisted on taking batting practice despite being both a rookie who did not play regularly, and a pitcher, he arrived to find his bats sawn in half. His teammates nicknamed him \"the Big Baboon\", a name the swarthy Ruth, who had disliked the nickname \"Niggerlips\" at St. Mary's, detested.<ref>Montville, pp. 43\u201344</ref> Ruth had received a raise on promotion to the major leagues, and quickly acquired tastes for fine food, liquor, and women, among other temptations.<ref>Wagenheim, pp. 27\u201329</ref><ref>Creamer, pp. 52\u201355</ref>\n\nManager Carrigan allowed Ruth to pitch two [[exhibition game]]s in mid-August. Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, he was not restored to the pitching rotation. It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends\u2014filmed for the screen in ''[[The Babe Ruth Story]]'' (1948)\u2014that the young pitcher had a habit of signaling his intent to throw a [[curveball]] by sticking out his tongue slightly, and that he was easy to hit until this changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the need to break Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not use him at all. The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor behavior by the rookie.<ref>Creamer, pp. 89\u201390</ref>\n\n[[File:1914 Providence Grays with Babe Ruth.jpg|thumb|right|Providence Grays with Babe Ruth (top row, center), 1914]]\nOn July 30, 1914, Boston owner [[Joseph Lannin]] had purchased the minor-league [[Providence Grays (minor league)|Providence Grays]], members of the International League.<ref>Montville, p. 44</ref> The Providence team had been owned by several people associated with the [[Detroit Tigers]], including star hitter [[Ty Cobb]], and as part of the transaction, a Providence pitcher was sent to the Tigers. To soothe Providence fans upset at losing a star, Lannin announced that the Red Sox would soon send a replacement to the Grays. This was intended to be Ruth, but his departure for Providence was delayed when Cincinnati Reds owner [[Garry Herrmann]] [[Waivers (MLB)|claimed him off waivers]]. After Lannin wrote to Herrmann explaining that the Red Sox wanted Ruth in Providence so he could develop as a player, and would not release him to a major league club, Herrmann allowed Ruth to be sent to the minors. Carrigan later stated that Ruth was not sent down to Providence to make him a better player, but to help the Grays win the International League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]] (league championship).<ref>Creamer, pp. 92\u201393</ref>\n\nRuth joined the Grays on August 18, 1914. After Dunn's deals, the Baltimore Orioles managed to hold on to first place until August 15, after which they continued to fade, leaving the pennant race between Providence and [[Rochester Red Wings|Rochester]]. Ruth was deeply impressed by Providence manager [[Bill Donovan|\"Wild Bill\" Donovan]], previously a star pitcher with a 25\u20134 [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|win\u2013loss record]] for Detroit in 1907; in later years, he credited Donovan with teaching him much about pitching. Ruth was often called upon to pitch, in one stretch starting (and winning) four games in eight days. On September 5 at [[Maple Leaf Park]] in Toronto, Ruth pitched a one-hit 9\u20130 victory, and hit his first professional home run, his only one as a minor leaguer, off [[Ellis Johnson (baseball)|Ellis Johnson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/83873114/ten-facts-for-100th-anniversary-of-babe-ruths-debut/|title=Ten facts for 100th anniversary of the Babe's debut|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony|publisher=MLB.com|date=July 10, 2014|accessdate=January 7, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109021513/http://m.mlb.com/news/article/83873114/ten-facts-for-100th-anniversary-of-babe-ruths-debut/|archivedate=January 9, 2017}}</ref> Recalled to Boston after Providence finished the season in first place, he pitched and won a game for the Red Sox against the [[New York Yankees]] on October 2, getting his first major league hit, a [[double (baseball)|double]]. Ruth finished the season with a record of 2\u20131 as a major leaguer and 23\u20138 in the International League (for Baltimore and Providence). Once the season concluded, Ruth married Helen in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]]. Creamer speculated that they did not marry in Baltimore, where the newlyweds boarded with George Ruth Sr., to avoid possible interference from those at St. Mary's\u2014both bride and groom were not yet of age<ref name=\"99facts\" /><ref>Creamer, pp. 99\u2013100</ref> and Ruth remained on parole from that institution until his 21st birthday.<ref>Creamer, p. 103</ref>\n\nIn March 1915, Ruth reported to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] for his first major league [[spring training]]. Despite a relatively successful first season, he was not slated to start regularly for the Red Sox, who already had two stellar left-handed pitchers: the established stars [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]], who had broken the record for the lowest [[earned run average]] (ERA) in a single season; and [[Ray Collins (baseball)|Ray Collins]], a 20-game winner in both 1913 and 1914. Ruth was ineffective in his first start, taking the loss in the third game of the season. Injuries and ineffective pitching by other Boston pitchers gave Ruth another chance, and after some good [[relief pitcher|relief]] appearances, Carrigan allowed Ruth another start, and he won a rain-shortened seven inning game. Ten days later, the manager had him start against the New York Yankees at the [[Polo Grounds]]. Ruth took a 3\u20132 lead into the ninth, but lost the game 4\u20133 in 13 innings. Ruth, hitting ninth as was customary for pitchers, hit a massive home run into the upper deck in [[right fielder|right field]] off of [[Jack Warhop]]. At the time, home runs were rare in baseball, and Ruth's majestic shot awed the crowd. The winning pitcher, Warhop, would in August 1915 conclude a major league career of eight seasons, undistinguished but for being the first major league pitcher to give up a home run to Babe Ruth.<ref>Creamer, p. 106</ref>\n\n[[File:Babe Ruth by Conlon, 1916.jpeg|thumb|left|Ruth during batting practice in 1916.]]\nCarrigan was sufficiently impressed by Ruth's pitching to give him a spot in the starting rotation. Ruth finished the 1915 season 18\u20138 as a pitcher; as a hitter, he batted .315 and had four home runs. The Red Sox won the [[List of American League pennant winners|AL pennant]], but with the pitching staff healthy, Ruth was not called upon to pitch in the [[1915 World Series]] against the Philadelphia Phillies. Boston won in five games; Ruth was used as a pinch hitter in Game Five, but [[Ground out (baseball)|grounded out]] against Phillies ace [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]].<ref>Montville, pp. 50\u201352</ref> Despite his success as a pitcher, Ruth was acquiring a reputation for long home runs; at [[Sportsman's Park]] against the [[St. Louis Browns]], a Ruth hit soared over Grand Avenue, breaking the window of a [[Chevrolet]] dealership.<ref>Wagenheim, p. 33</ref>\n\nIn 1916, there was attention focused on Ruth for his pitching, as he engaged in repeated pitching duels with the ace of the Washington Senators, [[Walter Johnson]]. The two met five times during the season, with Ruth winning four and Johnson one (Ruth had a [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|no decision]] in Johnson's victory). Two of Ruth's victories were by the score of 1\u20130, one in a 13-inning game. Of the 1\u20130 [[Shutouts in baseball|shutout]] decided without extra innings, AL President [[Ban Johnson]] stated, \"That was one of the best ball games I have ever seen.\"<ref>Montville, pp. 56\u201357</ref> For the season, Ruth went 23\u201312, with a 1.75 ERA and nine shutouts, both of which led the league.<ref>Montville, p. 55.</ref> Ruth's nine shutouts in 1916 set a league record for left-handers that would remain unmatched until [[Ron Guidry]] tied it in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|last= Schlueter|first=Roger|title=Verlander's 2011 was epic|publisher=MLB.com|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20120223&content_id=26813526&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref> The Red Sox won the pennant and [[1916 World Series|World Series]] again, this time defeating the [[Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Robins]] (as the Dodgers were then known) in five games.

Conscription was introduced in September 1917, and most baseball players in the big leagues were of draft age. This included Barry, who was a player-manager, and who joined the [[United States Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]] in an attempt to avoid the draft, only to be called up after the 1917 season. Frazee hired International League President [[Ed Barrow]] as Red Sox manager. Barrow had spent the previous 30 years in a variety of baseball jobs, though he never played the game professionally. With the major leagues shorthanded due to the war, Barrow had many holes in the Red Sox lineup to fill.<ref name=\"m67plus\" />\n\nRuth also noticed these vacancies in the lineup; he was dissatisfied in the role of a pitcher who appeared every four or five days and wanted to play every day at another position. Barrow used Ruth at [[first baseman|first base]] and in the [[outfield]] during the exhibition season, but he restricted him to pitching as the team moved towards Boston and the season opener. At the time, Ruth was possibly the best left-handed pitcher in baseball, and allowing him to play another position was an experiment that could have backfired.<ref name=\"m67plus\" />\n\nInexperienced as a manager, Barrow had player [[Harry Hooper]] advise him on baseball game strategy. Hooper urged his manager to allow Ruth to play another position when he was not pitching,<ref name=\"m67plus\" /> arguing to Barrow, who had invested in the club, that the crowds were larger on days when Ruth played, as they were attracted by his hitting.<ref name=\"c153\">Creamer, p. 153</ref> Barrow gave in early in May; Ruth promptly hit home runs in four consecutive games (one an exhibition), the last off of Walter Johnson.<ref name=\"m67plus\">Montville, pp. 67\u201369</ref> For the first time in his career (disregarding pinch-hitting appearances), Ruth was assigned a place in the [[Batting order (baseball)|batting order]] higher than ninth.<ref name=\"c153\" />\n\nAlthough Barrow predicted that Ruth would beg to return to pitching the first time he experienced a batting slump, that did not occur. Barrow used Ruth primarily as an outfielder in the war-shortened 1918 season. Ruth hit .300, with 11 home runs, enough to secure him a share of the [[List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders|major league home run title]] with [[Tilly Walker]] of the Philadelphia Athletics. He was still occasionally used as a pitcher, and had a 13\u20137 record with a 2.22 ERA.<ref name=\"stats\" /><ref>Wagenheim, p. 42</ref><ref>Creamer, pp. 153\u2013170</ref>\n\nIn 1918, the Red Sox won their third pennant in four years and faced the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[1918 World Series|World Series]], which began on September 5, the earliest date in history. The season had been shortened because the government had ruled that baseball players who were eligible for the military would have to be inducted or work in critical war industries, such as armaments plants. Ruth pitched and won Game One for the Red Sox, a 1\u20130 shutout. Before Game Four, Ruth injured his left hand in a fight; he pitched anyway. He gave up seven hits and six walks, but was helped by outstanding fielding behind him and by his own batting efforts, as a fourth-inning [[Triple (baseball)|triple]] by Ruth gave his team a 2\u20130 lead. The Cubs tied the game in the eighth inning, but the Red Sox scored to take a 3\u20132 lead again in the bottom of that inning. After Ruth gave up a hit and a walk to start the ninth inning, he was relieved on the mound by [[Bullet Joe Bush|Joe Bush]]. To keep Ruth and his bat in the game, he was sent to play [[left fielder|left field]]. Bush retired the side to give Ruth his second win of the Series, and the third and last World Series pitching victory of his career, against no defeats, in three pitching appearances. Ruth's effort gave his team a three-games-to-one lead, and two days later the Red Sox won their third Series in four years, four-games-to-two. Before allowing the Cubs to score in Game Four, Ruth pitched {{frac|29|2|3}} consecutive scoreless innings, a record for the World Series that stood for more than 40 years until 1961, broken by [[Whitey Ford]] after Ruth's death. Ruth was prouder of that record than he was of any of his batting feats.<ref name=\"stats\" /><ref>Creamer, pp. 170\u2013181</ref>\n\n[[File:Babe Ruth by Bain, 1919.jpg|thumb|left|Ruth in 1919]]\nWith the World Series over, Ruth gained exemption from the war draft by accepting a nominal position with a Pennsylvania steel mill. Many industrial establishments took pride in their baseball teams and sought to hire major leaguers. The end of the war in November set Ruth free to play baseball without such contrivances.<ref>Montville, pp. 78\u201380</ref>\n\nDuring the 1919 season, Ruth was used as a pitcher in only 17 of his 130 games<ref name=\"stats\" /> and compiled an 8\u20135 record. Barrow used him as a pitcher mostly in the early part of the season, when the Red Sox manager still had hopes of a second consecutive pennant. By late June, the Red Sox were clearly out of the race, and Barrow had no objection to Ruth concentrating on his hitting, if only because it drew people to the ballpark. Ruth had hit a home run against the Yankees on Opening Day, and another during a month-long batting slump that soon followed. Relieved of his pitching duties, Ruth began an unprecedented spell of slugging home runs, which gave him widespread public and press attention. Even his failures were seen as majestic\u2014one sportswriter noted, \"When Ruth misses a swipe at the ball, the stands quiver\".<ref>Creamer, pp. 196\u2013197</ref>\n\nTwo home runs by Ruth on July 5, and one in each of two consecutive games a week later, raised his season total to 11, tying his career best from 1918. The first record to fall was the AL single-season mark of 16, set by [[Socks Seybold|Ralph \"Socks\" Seybold]] in 1902. Ruth matched that on July 29, then pulled ahead toward the [[List of Major League Baseball progressive single-season home run leaders|major league record]] of 24, set by [[Buck Freeman]] in 1899. Ruth reached this on September 8, by which time, writers had discovered that [[Ned Williamson]] of the 1884 [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]] had hit 27\u2014though in a ballpark where the distance to right field was only {{convert|215|ft}}. On September 20, \"Babe Ruth Day\" at Fenway Park, Ruth won the game with a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning, tying Williamson. He broke the record four days later against the Yankees at the Polo Grounds, and hit one more against the Senators to finish with 29. The home run at Washington made Ruth the first major league player to hit a home run at all eight ballparks in his league. In spite of Ruth's hitting heroics, the Red Sox finished sixth, {{frac|20|1|2}} games behind the league champion White Sox.{{efn|The American League had eight teams from 1901 to 1960.}}<ref>Montville, pp. 88\u201390</ref><ref>Creamer, p. 203</ref>\n\n===Sale to New York===\nAs an out-of-towner from New York City, Frazee had been regarded with suspicion by Boston's sportswriters and baseball fans when he bought the team. He won them over with success on the field and a willingness to build the Red Sox by purchasing or trading for players. He offered the Senators $60,000 for Walter Johnson, but Washington owner [[Clark Griffith]] was unwilling. Even so, Frazee was successful in bringing other players to Boston, especially as replacements for players in the military. This willingness to spend for players helped the Red Sox secure the 1918 title.<ref>Reisler, pp. 4\u20135</ref> The 1919 season saw record-breaking attendance, and Ruth's home runs for Boston made him a national sensation. In March 1919 Ruth was reported as having accepted a three-year contract for a total of $27,000, after protracted negotiations.<ref name=\":0\" />  Nevertheless, on December 26, 1919, Frazee sold Ruth's contract to the New York Yankees.<ref>Creamer, pp. 204\u2013205</ref>\n\n[[File:Babe Ruth by Paul Thompson, 1920.jpg|thumb|right|Ruth in his first year with the New York Yankees, 1920]]\nNot all of the circumstances concerning the sale are known, but brewer and former congressman [[Jacob Ruppert]], the New York team's principal owner, reportedly asked Yankee manager [[Miller Huggins]] what the team needed to be successful. \"Get Ruth from Boston\", Huggins supposedly replied, noting that Frazee was perennially in need of money to finance his theatrical productions.<ref>Reisler, pp. 2\u20133</ref> In any event, there was precedent for the Ruth transaction: when Boston pitcher [[Carl Mays]] left the Red Sox in a 1919 dispute, Frazee had settled the matter by selling Mays to the Yankees, though over the opposition of AL President Johnson.<ref>Reisler, p. 3</ref>\n\nAccording to one of Ruth's biographers, Jim Reisler, \"why Frazee needed cash in 1919\u2014and large infusions of it quickly\u2014is still, more than 80 years later, a bit of a mystery\".<ref name=\"r5\" /> The often-told story is that Frazee needed money to finance the musical ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'', which was a Broadway hit and brought Frazee financial security. That play did not open until 1925, however, by which time Frazee had sold the Red Sox.<ref name=\"c20\" /> Still, the story may be true in essence: ''No, No, Nanette'' was based on a Frazee-produced play, ''My Lady Friends'', which opened in 1919.<ref>Montville, pp. 101\u2013102</ref>\n\nThere were other financial pressures on Frazee, despite his team's success. Ruth, fully aware of baseball's popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921. He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures.<ref name=\"c20\">Creamer, p. 20</ref> Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money.<ref>Stout, p. 83</ref> Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from the purchase of the club.<ref name=\"r5\">Reisler, p. 5</ref>\n\nAlthough Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel [[Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston|Tillinghast Huston]], were both wealthy, and had aggressively purchased and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 to build a winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.<ref>Creamer, pp. 205\u2013207</ref>\n\nFrazee sold the rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a baseball player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargain.<ref>Reisler, p. 1</ref><ref name=\"creamer208plus\">Creamer, pp. 208\u2013209</ref> Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee.<ref name=\"r2\" >Reisler, p. 2</ref> The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.<ref name=\"creamer208plus\" />\n\nThe transaction was contingent on Ruth signing a new contract, which was quickly accomplished\u2014Ruth agreed to fulfill the remaining two years on his contract, but was given a $20,000 bonus, payable over two seasons. The deal was announced on January 6, 1920. Reaction in Boston was mixed: some fans were embittered at the loss of Ruth; others conceded that the slugger had become difficult to deal with.<ref>Stout, pp. 86\u201388</ref> ''The New York Times'' suggested presciently, \"The short right field wall at the Polo Grounds should prove an easy target for Ruth next season and, playing seventy-seven games at home, it would not be surprising if Ruth surpassed his home run record of twenty-nine circuit clouts next Summer.\"<ref name=\"Year1920\">{{cite news|title=Ruth Bought By New York Americans For $125,000, Highest Price in Baseball Annals|work=The New York Times|date=January 6, 1920|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/01/06/102732651.pdf}}</ref> According to Reisler, \"The Yankees had pulled off the sports steal of the century.\"<ref name=\"r2\"/>\n\nAccording to Marty Appel in his history of the Yankees, the transaction, \"changed the fortunes of two high-profile franchises for decades\".<ref>Appel, p. 94</ref> The Red Sox, winners of five of the first sixteen World Series, those played between 1903 and 1919,{{efn|There was no World Series in 1904 or 1994.}} would not win another pennant until 1946, or another World Series until [[2004 World Series|2004]], a drought attributed in baseball superstition to Frazee's sale of Ruth and sometimes dubbed the \"[[Curse of the Bambino]]\".

Ruth had done little, having injured himself swinging the bat.<ref>Stout, p. 90</ref> Both situations began to change on May 1, when Ruth hit a tape measure home run that sent the ball completely out of the Polo Grounds, a feat believed to have been previously accomplished only by [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]].

Ruth tied his own record of 29 on July 15 and broke it with home runs in both games of a doubleheader four days later. By the end of July, he had 37, but his pace slackened somewhat after that.<ref>Creamer, p. 226</ref> Nevertheless, on September 4, he both tied and broke the organized baseball record for home runs in a season, snapping [[Perry Werden]]'s 1895 mark of 44 in the minor [[Western League (original)|Western League]].<ref>Wagenheim, p. 75</ref> The Yankees played well as a team, battling for the league lead early in the summer, but slumped in August in the AL pennant battle with Chicago and Cleveland. The pennant and the [[1920 World Series|World Series]] were won by Cleveland, who surged ahead after the [[Black Sox Scandal]] broke on September 28 and led to the suspension of many of Chicago's top players, including Shoeless Joe Jackson. The Yankees finished third, but drew 1.2&nbsp;million fans to the Polo Grounds, the first time a team had drawn a seven-figure attendance. The rest of the league sold 600,000 more tickets, many fans there to see Ruth, who led the league with 54 home runs, 158 [[Run (baseball)|runs]], and 137 [[runs batted in]] (RBIs).<ref>Stout, p. 92</ref>\n\nIn 1920 and afterwards, Ruth was aided in his power hitting by the fact that A.J. Reach Company\u2014the maker of baseballs used in the major leagues\u2014was using a more efficient machine to wind the yarn found within the baseball. The new baseballs went into play in 1920 and ushered the start of the [[live-ball era]]; the number of home runs across the major leagues increased by 184 over the previous year.<ref>Reisler, pp. 100\u2013101</ref> Baseball statistician [[Bill James]] pointed out that while Ruth was likely aided by the change in the baseball, there were other factors at work, including the gradual abolition of the [[spitball]] (accelerated after the death of [[Ray Chapman]], struck by a pitched ball thrown by Mays in August 1920) and the more frequent use of new baseballs (also a response to Chapman's death). Nevertheless, James theorized that Ruth's 1920 explosion might have happened in 1919, had a full season of 154 games been played rather than 140, had Ruth refrained from pitching 133 innings that season, and if he were playing at  any other home field but Fenway Park, where he hit only 9 of 29 home runs.<ref>James, pp. 120\u2013122</ref>\n\n[[File:1920 Babe Ruth and Shoeless Joe.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ruth and Shoeless Joe Jackson looking at one of Babe's home run bats, 1920]]\nYankees business manager Harry Sparrow had died early in the 1920 season. Ruppert and Huston hired Barrow to replace him.<ref>Stout, p. 93</ref> The two men quickly made a deal with Frazee for New York to acquire some of the players who would be mainstays of the early Yankee pennant-winning teams, including catcher [[Wally Schang]] and pitcher [[Waite Hoyt]].<ref>Creamer, p. 131</ref> The 21-year-old Hoyt became close to Ruth:\n\n{{quote|The outrageous life fascinated Hoyt, the don't-give-a-shit freedom of it, the nonstop, pell-mell charge into excess.

Each of the almost 600 home runs Ruth hit in his career after that extended his own record. After a slow start, the Yankees were soon locked in a tight pennant race with Cleveland, winners of the [[1920 World Series]]. On September 15, Ruth hit his 55th home run, shattering his year-old single season record. In late September, the Yankees visited Cleveland and won three out of four games, giving them the upper hand in the race, and clinched their first pennant a few days later. Ruth finished the regular season with 59 home runs, batting .378 and with a [[slugging percentage]] of .846.<ref>Creamer, pp. 204, 238\u2013240</ref>\n\nThe Yankees had high expectations when they met the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] in the [[1921 World Series]], every game of which was played in the Polo Grounds.  The Yankees won the first two games with Ruth in the lineup. However, Ruth badly scraped his elbow during Game 2 when he slid into third base (he had walked and [[stolen base|stolen]] both second and third bases). After the game, he was told by the team physician not to play the rest of the series.<ref>Spatz & Steinberg, p. 355.</ref> Despite this advice, he did play in the next three games, and pinch-hit in Game Eight of the best-of-nine series, but the Yankees lost, five games to three.

Despite Ruth's off-year, the Yankees managed to win the pennant and faced the New York Giants in the [[1922 World Series|World Series]] for the second consecutive year. In the Series, Giants manager John McGraw instructed his pitchers to throw him nothing but curveballs, and Ruth never adjusted. Ruth had just two hits in seventeen at bats, and the Yankees lost to the Giants for the second straight year, by 4\u20130 (with one tie game). Sportswriter [[Joe Vila]] called him, \"an exploded phenomenon\".<ref>Stout, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nAfter the season, Ruth was a guest at an [[Elks Club]] banquet, set up by Ruth's agent with Yankee team support. There, each speaker, concluding with future New York mayor [[Jimmy Walker]], censured him for his poor behavior. An emotional Ruth promised reform, and, to the surprise of many, followed through.

Ruppert and Huston had long contemplated a new stadium, and had taken an option on property at 161st Street and River Avenue in [[the Bronx]]. [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] was completed in time for the home opener on April 18, 1923,<ref>Graham, pp. 75\u201376</ref> at which the Babe hit the first home run in what was quickly dubbed \"the House that Ruth Built\".<ref name = \"s105\">Stout, p. 105</ref> The ballpark was designed with Ruth in mind: although the venue's left-field fence was further from home plate than at the Polo Grounds, Yankee Stadium's right-field fence was closer, making home runs easier to hit for left-handed batters.

The [[St. Louis Cardinals]] had won the National League with the lowest winning percentage for a pennant winner to that point (.578) and the Yankees were expected to win the [[1926 World Series|World Series]] easily.<ref>Creamer, pp. 304\u2013305</ref> Although the Yankees won the opener in New York, St. Louis took Games Two and Three. In Game Four, Ruth hit three home runs\u2014the first time this had been done in a World Series game\u2014to lead the Yankees to victory. In the fifth game, Ruth caught a ball as he crashed into the fence. The play was described by baseball writers as a defensive gem. New York took that game, but [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] won Game Six for St. Louis to tie the Series at three games each, then got very drunk. He was nevertheless inserted into Game Seven in the seventh inning and shut down the Yankees to win the game, 3\u20132, and win the Series.<ref>Wagenheim, pp. 154\u2013155</ref> Ruth had hit his fourth home run of the Series earlier in the game and was the only Yankee to reach base off Alexander; he walked in the ninth inning before being thrown out to end the game when he attempted to steal second base.

Ruth promised the child that he would hit a home run on his behalf. Sylvester had been injured in a fall from a horse, and a friend of Sylvester's father gave the boy two autographed baseballs signed by Yankees and Cardinals. The friend relayed a promise from Ruth (who did not know the boy) that he would hit a home run for him. After the Series, Ruth visited the boy in the hospital. When the matter became public, the press greatly inflated it, and by some accounts, Ruth allegedly saved the boy's life by visiting him, emotionally promising to hit a home run, and doing so.<ref>Creamer, pp. 327\u2013328</ref>\n\nThe 1927 New York Yankees team is considered one of the greatest squads to ever take the field. Known as [[Murderers' Row]] because of the power of its lineup,<ref>Stout, pp. 126\u2013131</ref> the team clinched first place on Labor Day, won a then-AL-record 110 games and took the AL pennant by 19 games.<ref>Graham, pp. 127\u2013134</ref> There was no suspense in the pennant race, and the nation turned its attention to Ruth's pursuit of his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers. Ruth was not alone in this chase. Teammate Lou Gehrig proved to be a slugger who was capable of challenging Ruth for his home run crown; he tied Ruth with 24 home runs late in June. Through July and August, the dynamic duo was never separated by more than two home runs. Gehrig took the lead, 45\u201344, in the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park early in September; Ruth responded with two blasts of his own to take the lead, as it proved permanently\u2014Gehrig finished with 47. Even so, as of September 6, Ruth was still several games off his 1921 pace, and going into the final series against the Senators, had only 57. He hit two in the first game of the series, including one off of [[Paul Hopkins (baseball)|Paul Hopkins]], facing his first major league batter, to tie the record. The following day, September 30, he broke it with his 60th homer, in the eighth inning off [[Tom Zachary]] to break a 2\u20132 tie. \"Sixty!

He then slumped for the latter part of the season, and he hit just twelve home runs in the last two months. Ruth's batting average also fell to .323, well below his career average.

The games at Yankee Stadium had not been sellouts; both were won by the home team, with Ruth collecting two singles, but scoring four runs as he was walked four times by the Cubs pitchers. In Chicago, Ruth was resentful at the hostile crowds that met the Yankees' train and jeered them at the hotel. The crowd for Game Three included New York Governor [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the Democratic candidate for president, who sat with Chicago Mayor [[Anton Cermak]]. Many in the crowd threw lemons at Ruth, a sign of derision, and others (as well as the Cubs themselves) shouted abuse at Ruth and other Yankees. They were briefly silenced when Ruth hit a three-run home run off [[Charlie Root]] in the first inning, but soon revived, and the Cubs tied the score at 4\u20134 in the fourth inning. When Ruth came to the plate in the top of the fifth, the Chicago crowd and players, led by pitcher [[Guy Bush]], were screaming insults at Ruth. With the [[Count (baseball)|count]] at two balls and one strike, Ruth gestured, possibly in the direction of [[center fielder|center field]], and after the next pitch (a strike), may have pointed there with one hand. Ruth hit the fifth pitch over the center field fence; estimates were that it traveled nearly {{convert|500|ft}}.

He was often spoken of as a possible candidate as managerial jobs opened up, but in 1932, when he was mentioned as a contender for the Red Sox position, Ruth stated that he was not yet ready to leave the field. There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the [[Cleveland Indians]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], and [[Detroit Tigers]] were looking for a manager, but nothing came of them.<ref name=\"Montvillepp\">Montville, pp. 322\u2013323.</ref>\n\nJust before the 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make Ruth the manager of the Yankees' top minor-league team, the [[Newark Bears (International League)|Newark Bears]], but he was talked out of it by his wife, [[Claire Merritt Ruth|Claire]], and his business manager, Christy Walsh.<ref name=Neyer42/> Shortly afterward, Tigers owner [[Frank Navin]] made a proposal to Ruppert and Barrow\u2014if the Yankees traded Ruth to Detroit, Navin would name Ruth player-manager. Navin believed Ruth would not only bring a winning attitude to a team that had not finished higher than third since 1923, but would also revive the Tigers' sagging attendance figures. Navin asked Ruth to come to Detroit for an interview. However, Ruth balked, since Walsh had already arranged for him to take part in a celebrity golf tournament in Hawaii. Ruth and Navin negotiated over the phone while Ruth was in Hawaii, but those talks foundered when Navin refused to give Ruth a portion of the Tigers' box office proceeds.<ref>Ferkovich, Scott.

Ruppert always supported McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons. The relationship between Ruth and McCarthy had been lukewarm at best and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their interpersonal relations.<ref name=Neyer42/> By the end of the season, Ruth hinted that he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M7VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LWkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5558,6110848|title=Ruth to Quit Unless Given Manager Job|first=Jimmy|last=Powers|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=October 9, 1934|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref> When the time came, Ruppert wanted his slugger to leave the team without drama or hard feelings.<ref name=\"Montvillepp\" />\n\nDuring the 1934\u201335 offseason, Ruth circled the world with his wife; the trip included a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player [[Alan Fairfax]], and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, he stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field<!-- American lingo, we know it's a ground -->, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax regretted that he could not have the time to make Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.<ref>Montville, p. 336.</ref>\n\nAlso during the offseason, Ruppert had been sounding out the other clubs in hopes of finding one that would be willing to take Ruth as a manager and/or a player. However, the only serious offer came from Athletics owner-manager Connie Mack, who gave some thought to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth. However, Mack later dropped the idea, saying that Ruth's wife would be running the team in a month if Ruth ever took over.<ref>Neyer, p. 43.</ref>\n\nWhile the barnstorming tour was underway, Ruppert began negotiating with Boston Braves owner Judge [[Emil Fuchs (baseball)|Emil Fuchs]], who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction. The Braves had enjoyed modest recent success, finishing fourth in the National League in both 1933 and 1934, but the team drew poorly at the box office. Unable to afford the rent at [[Braves Field]], Fuchs had considered holding dog races there when the Braves were not at home, only to be turned down by Landis. After a series of phone calls, letters, and meetings, the Yankees traded Ruth to the Braves on February 26, 1935. Ruppert had stated that he would not release Ruth to go to another team as a full-time player. For this reason, it was announced that Ruth would become a team vice president and would be consulted on all club transactions, in addition to playing. He was also made assistant manager to Braves skipper [[Bill McKechnie]]. In a long letter to Ruth a few days before the press conference, Fuchs promised Ruth a share in the Braves' profits, with the possibility of becoming co-owner of the team. Fuchs also raised the possibility of Ruth succeeding McKechnie as manager, perhaps as early as 1936. Ruppert called the deal \"the greatest opportunity Ruth ever had\".<ref>Neyer, pp.&nbsp;42\u201344.</ref><ref>Montville, pp. 337\u2013339.</ref>\n\nThere was considerable attention as Ruth reported for spring training. He did not hit his first home run of the spring until after the team had left Florida, and was beginning the road north in Savannah. He hit two in an exhibition game against the Bears.<ref>Montville, p. 339.</ref> Amid much press attention, Ruth played his first home game in Boston in over 16 years. Before an opening-day crowd of over 25,000, including five of New England's six state governors, Ruth accounted for all of the Braves' runs in a 4\u20132 defeat of the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], hitting a two-run home run, singling to drive in a third run and later in the inning scoring the fourth. Although age and weight had slowed him, he made a running catch in left field that sportswriters deemed the defensive highlight of the game.<ref>Creamer, p. 393.</ref>\n\nRuth had two hits in the second game of the season, but it quickly went downhill both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice.<ref>Neyer, pp. 43\u201345.</ref> For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline.<ref>[[Lee Allen (baseball)|Allen, Lee]]. ''The National League Story''. Hill & Wang, 1961.</ref> The Braves' deterioration mirrored that of Ruth's; their Opening Day win was the only time they were above .500 all year.\n\nRuth soon realized that Fuchs had deceived him, and had no intention of making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties. He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets.<ref>Montville, p. 340.</ref> Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of ''his'' money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet.<ref name = \"neyer44\">Neyer, p. 44.</ref> As it turned out, Fuchs and Ruppert had both known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.<ref>Creamer, pp. 388\u2013390.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the first month of the season, Ruth concluded he was finished even as a part-time player. As early as May 12, he asked Fuchs to let him retire.<ref name=\"neyer44\"/> Ultimately, Fuchs persuaded Ruth to remain at least until after the [[Memorial Day]] doubleheader in Philadelphia. In the interim was a western road trip, at which the rival teams had scheduled days to honor him. In Chicago and St. Louis, Ruth performed poorly, and his batting average sank to .155, with only two additional home runs for a total of three on the season so far. In the first two games in Pittsburgh, Ruth had only one hit, though a long fly caught by [[Paul Waner]] probably would have been a home run in any other ballpark besides [[Forbes Field]].<ref>Creamer, pp. 395\u2013397</ref>\n\nRuth played in the third game of the Pittsburgh series on May 25, 1935, and added one more tale to his playing legend. Ruth went 4-for-4, including three home runs, though the Braves lost the game 11\u20137. The last two were off Ruth's old Cubs nemesis, Guy Bush. The final home run, both of the game and of Ruth's career, sailed out of the park over the right field upper deck\u2013the first time anyone had hit a fair ball completely out of Forbes Field. Ruth was urged to make this his last game, but he had given his word to Fuchs and played in Cincinnati and Philadelphia. The first game of the doubleheader in Philadelphia\u2014the Braves lost both\u2014was his final major league appearance. Ruth retired on June 2 after an argument with Fuchs. He finished 1935 with a .181 average\u2014easily his worst as a full-time position player\u2014and the final six of his 714 home runs. The Braves, 10\u201327 when Ruth left, finished 38\u2013115, at .248 the worst winning percentage in modern National League history.<ref>Creamer, pp. 396\u2013400</ref> Insolvent like his team, Fuchs gave up control of the Braves before the end of the season; the National League took over the franchise at the end of the year.<ref>Montville, p. 344.</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\n\n[[File:The Pride of the Yankees2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] and Ruth in the 1942 film ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]'']]\nAlthough Fuchs had given Ruth his unconditional release, no major league team expressed an interest in hiring him in any capacity. Ruth still hoped to be hired as a manager if he could not play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement and the end of the 1937 season. Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner [[Alva Bradley]] replied negatively.<ref name = \"c399a\" />\n\nThe writer Creamer believed Ruth was unfairly treated in never being given an opportunity to manage a major league club. The author believed there was not necessarily a relationship between personal conduct and managerial success, noting that [[John McGraw (baseball)|McGraw]], [[Billy Martin]], and [[Bobby Valentine]] were winners despite character flaws.<ref>Sherman, p. 17</ref> Team owners and general managers assessed Ruth's flamboyant personal habits as a reason to exclude him from a managerial job; Barrow said of him, \"How can he manage other men when he can't even manage himself?\"<ref name=\"99facts\" />\n\nRuth played much golf and in a few exhibition baseball games, where he demonstrated a continuing ability to draw large crowds. This appeal contributed to the Dodgers hiring him as first base coach in 1938.  When Ruth was hired, Brooklyn general manager [[Larry MacPhail]] made it clear that Ruth would not be considered for the manager's job if, as expected, [[Burleigh Grimes]] retired at the end of the season. Although much was said about what Ruth could teach the younger players, in practice, his duties were to appear on the field in uniform and encourage base runners\u2014he was not called upon to relay signs. Indeed, his most newsworthy accomplishment during this period was hitting a 430-foot home run\u2014and thus earning the fifty-dollar grand prize\u2014in a pre-game distance hitting contest held at [[Sportsman's Park]] on July 24.<ref>Associated Press (July 25, 1938).

The next week, Ruth went to [[Cooperstown, New York]], for the formal opening of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]]. Three years earlier, he was one of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|first five players]] elected to the hall. As radio broadcasts of baseball games became popular, Ruth sought a job in that field, arguing that his celebrity and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but he received no offers.<ref>Wagenheim, pp. 247\u2013249.</ref> During World War II, he made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including his last appearance as a player at Yankee Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army-Navy Relief Fund. He hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; the blast left the field, curving foul, but Ruth circled the bases anyway.

The two men reportedly never spoke off the field until they reconciled at Yankee Stadium on Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day, July 4, 1939, which was shortly after Gehrig's retirement from baseball.<ref>Creamer, p. 415.</ref>\n\nAlthough Ruth was married throughout most of his baseball career, when team co-owner [[Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston|Tillinghast 'Cap' Huston]] asked him to tone down his lifestyle, the player said, \"I'll promise to go easier on drinking and to get to bed earlier, but not for you, fifty thousand dollars, or two-hundred and fifty thousand dollars will I give up women.

His performance during the 1922 season had been disappointing, in part attributed to his drinking and late-night hours. After the end of the 1922 season he was asked to sign a contract addendum with a [[morals clause]]. Ruth and Ruppert signed it on November 11, 1922. It called for Ruth to abstain entirely from the use of intoxicating liquors, and to not stay up later than 1:00 a.m. during the training and playing season without permission of the manager. Ruth was also enjoined from any action or misbehavior which would compromise his ability to play baseball.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.ha.com/itm/baseball/1922-babe-ruth-signed-contract-addendum-limiting-his-drinking-late-nights-i-ll-promise-to-go-easier-on-drinking-an/a/707-19090.s?ic4=GalleryView-Thumbnail-071515 |title=1922 Babe Ruth Signed Contract Addendum Limiting His Drinking, Late Nights |last= |first= |page=5 |website=Heritage Auctions logo The World's Largest Collectibles Auctioneer |access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cancer and death (1946\u201348)==\nAs early as the war years, doctors had cautioned Ruth to take better care of his health, and he grudgingly followed their advice, limiting his drinking and not going on a proposed trip to support the troops in the South Pacific.<ref>Wagenheim, pp. 252\u2013253.</ref> In 1946, Ruth began experiencing severe pain over his left eye and had difficulty swallowing.

They treated him with teropterin, a [[folic acid]] derivative; he may have been the first human subject.<ref name = \"montville360\" /> Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on [[American Legion Baseball]]. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.<ref name = \"montville360\">Montville, p. 360.</ref><ref>Creamer, pp. 418\u2013420.</ref>\n\n{{MLBBioRet\n|Image = BabeRuth3.jpg\n|Name = Babe Ruth\n|Number = 3\n|Team = New York Yankees\n|Year = 1948\n|}}\n\nThe improvement was only a temporary remission, and by late 1947, Ruth was unable to help with the writing of his autobiography, ''The Babe Ruth Story'', which was almost entirely ghostwritten. In and out of the hospital in Manhattan, he left for Florida in February 1948, doing what activities he could. After six weeks he returned to New York to appear at a book-signing party.

By this time he had lost much weight and had difficulty walking. Introduced along with his surviving teammates from 1923, Ruth used a bat as a cane. [[Nat Fein]]'s photo of Ruth taken from behind, standing near home plate and facing \"Ruthville\" (right field) became one of baseball's most famous and widely circulated photographs, and won the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref>Wagenheim, pp. 267\u2013268.</ref>\n\nRuth made one final trip on behalf of American Legion Baseball, then entered [[Memorial Sloan\u2013Kettering Cancer Center|Memorial Hospital]], where he would die. He was never told he had cancer, but before his death, had surmised it. He was able to leave the hospital for a few short trips, including a final visit to Baltimore. On July 26, 1948, Ruth left the hospital to attend the premiere of the film ''[[The Babe Ruth Story]]''. Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually grew worse; only a few visitors were allowed to see him, one of whom was [[National League]] president and future [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Ford Frick]]. \"Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable. He had been such a big man and his arms were just skinny little bones, and his face was so haggard\", Frick said years later.<ref>Creamer, pp. 423\u2013424</ref>\n\nThousands of New Yorkers, including many children, stood vigil outside the hospital during Ruth's final days. On August 16, 1948, at 8:01&nbsp;p.m., Ruth died in his sleep at the age of 53. His open casket was placed on display in the rotunda of Yankee Stadium, where it remained for two days; 77,000 people filed past to pay him tribute. His funeral Mass took place at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (New York)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]]; a crowd estimated at 75,000 waited outside.

Baseball had been known for star players such as Ty Cobb and \"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson, but both men had uneasy relations with fans. In Cobb's case, the incidents were sometimes marked by violence. Ruth's biographers agreed that he benefited from the timing of his ascension to \"Home Run King\". The country had been hit hard by both the war and the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and longed for something to help put these traumas behind it. Ruth also resonated in a country which felt, in the aftermath of the war, that it took second place to no one. Montville argued that Ruth was a larger-than-life figure who was capable of unprecedented athletic feats in the nation's largest city. The Babe became an icon of the significant social changes that marked the early 1920s.<ref>Reisler, pp. xii\u2013xiii.</ref><ref>Montville, pp. 106\u2013107.</ref> In his history of the Yankees, Glenn Stout noted  that \"Ruth was New York incarnate\u2014uncouth and raw, flamboyant and flashy, oversized, out of scale, and absolutely unstoppable\".<ref name = \"st86\">Stout, p. 86</ref>\n\nDuring his lifetime, Ruth had become a symbol of the United States. During World War II, Japanese soldiers could think of no greater insult than to yell in English, \"To hell with Babe Ruth\", to anger American soldiers. Ruth replied that he hoped that \"every Jap that mention[ed] my name gets shot\".<ref name=\"bullock2004\">{{cite book | title=Playing for Their Nation: Baseball and the American Military during World War II | publisher=University of Nebraska Press | author=Bullock, Steven R. | year=2004 | pages=4 | isbn=978-0-8032-1337-1}}</ref> Creamer recorded that \"Babe Ruth transcended sport and moved far beyond the artificial limits of baselines and outfield fences and sports pages\".<ref name=\"c16\">Creamer, p. 16.</ref> Wagenheim stated, \"He appealed to a deeply rooted American yearning for the definitive climax: clean, quick, unarguable.\"<ref>Wagenheim, p. 6.</ref> According to Glenn Stout, \"Ruth's home runs were exalted, uplifting experience that meant more to fans than any runs they were responsible for. A Babe Ruth home run was an event unto itself, one that meant anything was possible.\"<ref name = \"st86\" />\n\nRuth's penchant for hitting home runs altered how baseball is played. Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games by getting a runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]], and the [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]]. Advocates of what was dubbed \"inside baseball\", such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering it a blot on the purity of the game.<ref>Reisler, p. 18.</ref> According to sportswriter W. A. Phelon, after the 1920 season, Ruth's breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, \"settled, for all time to come, that the American public is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star.\"<ref>Reisler, p. 236.</ref> Bill James noted, \"When the owners discovered that the fans ''liked'' to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace [in the Black Sox Scandal], then there was no turning back.\"<ref>James, p. 122</ref> While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.<ref>Reisler, pp. 237\u2013239.</ref>\n\nAccording to contemporary sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]], only two sports figures of the 1920s approached Ruth in popularity\u2014boxer [[Jack Dempsey]] and racehorse [[Man o' War]].<ref>Reisler, p. 200.</ref> One of the factors that contributed to Ruth's broad appeal was the uncertainty about his family and early life. Ruth appeared to exemplify the American success story, that even an uneducated, unsophisticated youth, without any family wealth or connections, can do something better than anyone else in the world. Montville noted that \"the fog [surrounding his childhood] will make him forever accessible, universal. He will be the patron saint of American possibility.\"<ref>Montville, pp. 13\u201314.</ref> Similarly, the fact that Ruth played in the pre-television era, when a relatively small portion of his fans had the opportunity to see him play allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters.<ref>Wagenheim, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Reisler noted that recent sluggers who surpassed Ruth's 60-home run mark, such as [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Barry Bonds]], generated much less excitement than when Ruth repeatedly broke the single-season home run record in the 1920s. Ruth dominated a relatively small sports world, while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch.<ref>Reisler, p. xv.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Claire Ruth.jpg|thumb|The unveiling of a Babe Ruth memorial plaque in Baltimore's old [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] in 1955 with Claire Ruth, his widow, present.]]\n\nCreamer termed Ruth \"a unique figure in the social history of the United States\".<ref name=\"c16\" /> Ruth has even entered the language: a dominant figure in a field, whether within or outside sports, is often referred to as \"the Babe Ruth\" of that field.<ref name=\"c16\" /> Similarly, \"Ruthian\" has come to mean in sports, \"colossal, dramatic, prodigious, magnificent; with great power.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Dickson Baseball Dictionary|edition=3rd|first=Paul|last=Dickson|page=731|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ceeU7xSLw5kC&lpg=PA373&dq=ruthian%20definition&pg=PA731#v=onepage&q=ruthian&f=false|publisher=W.W.

At least five of these books (including Creamer's and Wagenheim's) were written in 1973 and 1974. The books were timed to capitalize on the increase in public interest in Ruth as [[Hank Aaron|Henry Aaron]] approached his career home run mark, which he broke on April 8, 1974.<ref>Montville, pp. 1\u20136.</ref> As he approached Ruth's record, Aaron stated, \"I can't remember a day this year or last when I did not hear the name of Babe Ruth.\"<ref name=\"c16\" />\n\nMontville suggested that Ruth is probably even more popular today than he was when his career home run record was broken by Aaron. The long ball era that Ruth started continues in baseball, to the delight of the fans. Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on ''[[SportsCenter]]'' and ''[[Baseball Tonight]]'' each evening during the season. The questions of [[performance-enhancing drug]] use, which dogged later home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish Ruth's reputation; his overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time.<ref>Montville, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\nIn various surveys and rankings, Ruth has been named the greatest baseball player of all time.

Some barges are not self-propelled and must be towed or pushed by [[towboat]]s, canal barges or towed by draft animals on an adjacent [[towpath]]. Barges contended with the [[railway]] in the early [[Industrial Revolution]], but [[history of the British canal system|were outcompeted]] in the carriage of high-value items due to the higher speed, falling costs and route flexibility of [[Rail transport|railways]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:P\u00e9nicheRecyclageFerrailles2008De\u00fble2.jpg|thumb|right|Barge carrying recycling material on [[Canal de la De\u00fble|De\u00fble channel]] in [[Lambersart]], [[France]]]]\n''Barge'' is attested from 1300, from [[Old French]] ''barge'', from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''barga''. The word originally could refer to any small boat; the modern meaning arose around 1480. ''[[barque|Bark]]'', \"small ship\", is attested from 1420, from Old French ''barque'', from Vulgar Latin ''barca'' (400 AD). The more precise meaning \"three-masted ship\" arose in the 17th century, and often takes the French spelling for disambiguation. Both are probably derived from the [[Latin]] ''barica'', from {{lang-grc|\u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2|b\u00e1ris|Egyptian boat}}, from {{lang-cop|\u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89}} ''b\u0101ri'' \"small boat\", [[hieroglyphic]] Egyptian <small><hiero>D58-G29-M17-M17-D21-P1</hiero></small> and similar ''ba-y-r'' for \"basket-shaped boat\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8cMWickoS6oC&pg=PA202 ''An Egyptian hieroglyphic dictionary: with an index of English words''] by Sir Ernest Alfred Wallis Budge from [[Google Books]]</ref> By extension, the term \"embark\" literally means to board the kind of boat called a \"barque\".\n\nThe long pole used to maneuver or propel a barge has given rise to the saying \"I wouldn't touch that [subject/thing] with a barge pole.\"<ref>{{cite book | title = Speeches of Lord Randolph Churchill | editor = H.

On the UK canal system, boats wider than 7ft are often referred to as ''widebeam''.  In the United States, deckhands perform the labor and are supervised by a leadman or the mate. The captain and pilot steer the towboat, which pushes one or more barges held together with rigging, collectively called 'the tow'. The crew live aboard the towboat as it travels along the inland river system or the intracoastal waterways. These towboats travel between ports and are also called line-haul boats.\n\nPoles are used on barges to fend off the barge as it nears other vessels or a wharf. These are often called 'pike poles'.\n\n==Modern use==\n[[File:Chicago River towboat and barge 080405.jpg|thumb|right|Towboat pushing a barge on the [[Chicago River]]]]\nBarges are used today for low-value bulk items, as the cost of hauling goods by barge is very low. Barges are also used for very heavy or bulky items; a typical American barge measures {{convert|195|x|35|ft|m|sigfig=3}}, and can carry up to about {{convert|1500|ST|t}} of cargo. The most common European barge measures {{convert|76.5|x|11.4|m|ft}} and can carry up to about {{convert|2450|t|ST}}.\n\nAs an example, on June 26, 2006, a {{convert|565|ST|t|adj=on}} [[Cracking (chemistry)|catalytic cracking]] unit reactor was shipped by barge from the [[Tulsa Port of Catoosa]] in [[Oklahoma]] to a refinery in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]. Extremely large objects are normally shipped in sections and assembled onsite, but shipping an assembled unit reduced costs and avoided reliance on construction labor at the delivery site (which in this case was still recovering from [[Hurricane Katrina]]). Of the reactor's {{convert|700|mi|adj=on}} journey, only about {{convert|40|miles|km}} were traveled overland, from the final port to the refinery.\n\nSelf-propelled barges may be used as such when traveling downstream or upstream in placid waters; they are operated as an unpowered barge, with the assistance of a tugboat, when traveling upstream in faster waters. Canal barges are usually made for the particular canal in which they will operate.\n\nMany barges, primarily [[Dutch barge]]s, which were originally designed for carrying cargo along the canals of Europe, are no longer large enough to compete in this industry with larger newer vessels. Many of these barges have been renovated and are now used as luxury [[hotel barge]]s carrying holidaymakers along the same canals on which they once carried grain or coal.\n\n==Towed or otherwise unpowered barges in the United States==\n[[File:Cumberland River barge traffic.jpg|thumb|Multiple barges pushed around a tight bend on the [[Cumberland River]]]]\nIn primitive regions today and in all pre-development (lacking highways or railways) regions worldwide in times before industrial development and highways, barges were the predominant and most efficient means of inland transportation in many regions. This holds true today, for many areas of the world.\n\nIn such pre-industrialized, or poorly developed infrastructure regions, many barges are purpose-designed to be powered on waterways by long slender poles &mdash; thereby becoming known on American waterways as '''poleboats''' as the extensive west of North America was settled using the vast tributary river systems of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] [[drainage basin]]. Poleboats use muscle power of \"walkers\" along the sides of the craft pushing a pole against the streambed, canal or lake bottom to move the vessel where desired. In settling the American west it was generally faster to navigate downriver from [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], to the [[Ohio River]] confluence with the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and then pole upriver against the current to St. Louis than to travel overland on the rare primitive dirt roads for many decades after the [[American Revolution]].\n\nOnce the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads reached Chicago, that time dynamic changed, and American poleboats became less common, relegated to smaller rivers and more remote streams. On the Mississippi riverine system today, including that of other sheltered waterways, industrial barge trafficking in bulk raw materials such as coal, coke, timber, iron ore and other minerals is extremely common; in the developed world using huge '''cargo barges''' that connect in groups and trains-of-barges in ways that allow cargo volumes and weights considerably greater than those used by pioneers of modern barge systems and methods in the [[Victorian era]].\n[[File:The tugboat, Herbert P. Brake.jpg|thumb|[[Towboat]] ''Herbert P. Brake'' of New York pushes a new barge east on the [[Erie Canal]] in [[Fairport, New York|Fairport]], [[New York City|New York]], United States]]\n\nSuch barges need to be towed by [[tugboat]]s or pushed by [[towboat]]s. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on a waterway adjacent [[towpath]] were of fundamental importance in the early [[Industrial Revolution]], whose major early engineering projects were efforts to build [[viaduct]]s, [[navigable aqueduct|aqueducts]] and especially canals to fuel and feed raw materials to nascent factories in the early industrial takeoff (18th century) and take their goods to ports and cities for distribution.\n\nThe barge and canal system contended favourably with the [[railway]]s in the early [[Industrial Revolution]] before around the 1850s&ndash;1860s \u2014 for example, the [[Erie Canal]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] state is credited by economic historians with giving the growth boost needed for [[New York City]] to eclipse [[Philadelphia]] as America's largest port and city \u2014 but such canal systems with their locks, need for maintenance and dredging, pumps and sanitary issues [[history of the British canal system|were eventually outcompeted]] in the carriage of high-value items by the railways due to the higher speed, falling costs and route flexibility of [[rail transport]]. Barge and canal systems were nonetheless of great, perhaps even primary, economic importance until after the [[World War I|First World War]] in Europe, particularly in the more developed nations of the [[Low Countries]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]] and especially [[UK|Great Britain]] which more or less made the system characteristically its own.\n\nNowadays, custom built special purpose equipment called modular barges are extensively used in surveying, mapping, laying and burial of subsea optic fibre cables worldwide and other support services.\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Barge with cars.jpg|Self-propelled car barge on the [[River Danube]]\nFile:P\u00e9niches sur le Canal du Midi.jpg|Barges near [[Toulouse]], France\nFile:Andromeda (ship, 1958) Hannover Mittellandkanal 2006 by-RaBoe.jpg|Self-propelled barge ''Andromeda'' in canal at [[Hanover]], Germany\nFile:Messina_Karden_Bug.jpg|Tank barge on the [[River Moselle]], Germany\nFile:CrushedStoneBarge.jpg|Self-propelled barge carrying bulk crushed stone\nFile:IjmuidenBarge.jpg|Self-propelled barge in the port of [[IJmuiden]], Netherlands\nFile:Pegasus_barge_being_moved_by_Freedom_Star_and_towboat_American_2.jpg|Barge carrying the [[Space Shuttle]] external tank for STS-119 under tow to [[Port Canaveral]], [[Florida]], United States\nImage:Horse Drawing Barge on the Kennet and Avon Canal.JPG|Horse drawing a barge along the [[towpath]] of the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]], [[England]], [[UK]]\nFile:Yangzhou-Modern-Grand-Canal-boats-3351.JPG|Self-propelled barges on the [[Grand Canal of China]] near [[Yangzhou]], [[Jiangsu]], China\nFile:CoalbargePittsburgh.JPG|Coal barges passing [[Heinz Field]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] on the [[Ohio River]]\nFile:Suphannahongsa-docked.jpg|Royal Barge ''Suphannahong'' docked at [[Wat Arun]] [[pier]], one of the [[Thailand|Thai]] royal barges featured in the [[Royal Barge Procession|royal barge ceremony]]\nImage:Donna York.jpg|[[Towboat]] ''Donna York'' pushing barges of coal up the Ohio River at [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], United States\nFile:Ilya Repin -

For example, the adjective ''wee'' is almost exclusively used in parts of [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], and occasionally [[Yorkshire dialect|Yorkshire]], whereas ''little'' is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in written English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term British English. The forms of [[Spoken language|spoken]] English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken,<ref>{{cite news|first=Stuart |last=Jeffries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/27/regional-english-dialects|title=The G2 Guide to Regional English|journal=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 March 2009|at=section G2, p.&nbsp;12}}</ref> so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the ''Oxford Guide to World English'', British English shares \"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word '[[British people|British]]' and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity\".<ref>McArthur (2002), p.&nbsp;45.</ref>\n\nWhen distinguished from [[American English]], the term \"British English\" is sometimes used broadly as a synonym for [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|the various varieties of English]] spoken in some member states of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\n== History==\n{{Main|History of the English language}}\n[[English language|English]] is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought to Britain by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic settlers]] from various parts of what is now northwest [[Germany]] and the northern [[Netherlands]]. The resident population at this time was generally speaking [[Common Brittonic]]\u2014the insular variety of [[continental Celtic]], which was influenced by the [[Roman army|Roman]] occupation. This group of languages ([[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Cumbric]]) cohabited alongside [[English language|English]] into the modern period, but due to their remoteness from the [[Germanic languages]], influence on English was [[Lists of English words of Celtic origin|notably limited]]. However, the degree of influence remains debated, and it has recently been argued that its grammatical influence accounts for the substantial innovations noted between English and the other West Germanic languages.<ref>[[English and Welsh]], 1955 J. R. R. Tolkien, also see references in [[Brittonicisms in English]]</ref>\n\nInitially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] Kingdoms of England. One of these dialects, [[Late West Saxon]], eventually came to dominate. The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two waves of invasion: the first was by speakers of the Scandinavian branch of the Germanic family, who conquered and colonised parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second was the [[Normans]] in the 11th century, who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed an English variety of this called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. These two invasions caused English to become \"mixed\" to some degree (though it was never a truly [[mixed language]] in the strictest sense of the word; mixed languages arise from the cohabitation of speakers of different languages, who develop a hybrid tongue for basic communication).\n\nThe more idiomatic, concrete and descriptive English is, the more it is from Anglo-Saxon origins. The more intellectual and abstract English is, the more it contains [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]] influences e.g. swine (like the Germanic schwein) is the animal in the field bred by the occupied Anglo-Saxons and pork (like the French porc) is the animal at the table eaten by the occupying Normans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ling201/test3materials/HistEngoverhead.htm|title=Linguistics 201: History of English|website=pandora.cii.wwu.edu}}</ref>\n\nCohabitation with the Scandinavians resulted in a significant grammatical simplification and lexical enrichment of the [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] core of English; the later Norman occupation led to the grafting onto that Germanic core of a more elaborate layer of words from the Romance branch of the European languages. This Norman influence entered English largely through the courts and government. Thus, English developed into a [[loanword|\"borrowing\" language]] of great flexibility and with a huge [[vocabulary]].\n\n==Dialects==\n{{IPA notice|lang=en}}\n[[File:Phonological variation final.jpg|thumb|Map showing phonological variation within England of the vowel in ''bath'', ''grass'', and ''dance''.\n{{legend|#4F4F4F|'a' {{IPA|[\u00e4]}}}}\n{{legend|#819049|'aa' {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}}}}\n{{legend|#D56371|'ah' {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}}}}\n{{legend|#9C4B29|anomalies}}\nThose in the north generally pronounce such words with a short vowel whereas those in the south use a long vowel]]\n\n[[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|Dialects]] and [[Regional accents of English|accents]] vary amongst the four [[countries of the United Kingdom]], as well as within the countries themselves.\n\nThe major divisions are normally classified as [[English language in England|English English]] (or English as spoken in [[England]], which encompasses [[Southern English English|Southern English]] dialects, [[West Country English|West Country]] dialects, [[East Midlands English|East]] and [[West Midlands English]] dialects and [[English in northern England|Northern English]] dialects), [[Ulster English]] in [[Northern Ireland]], [[Welsh English]] (not to be confused with the [[Welsh language]]), and [[Scottish English]] (not to be confused with the [[Scots language]]). The various British dialects also differ in the words that they have borrowed from other languages. Around the middle of the 15th century, there were points where within the 5 major dialects there were almost 500 ways to spell the word ''though''.<ref name=\"thehistoryofenglish.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofenglish.com/history_early_modern.html|title=The History of English - Early Modern English (c. 1500 - c. 1800)|website=www.thehistoryofenglish.com}}</ref>\n\nFollowing its last major [[survey of English Dialects]] (1949\u20131950), the [[University of Leeds]] has started work on a new project. In May 2007 the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] awarded a grant to Leeds to study British regional dialects.<ref>[http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~smlsaj/ Professor Sally Johnson]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} biography on the [[Leeds University]] website</ref><ref name=MEO>[http://reporter.leeds.ac.uk/press_releases/current/voices.htm Mapping the English language\u2014from cockney to Orkney], [[Leeds University]] website, 25 May 2007.</ref>\n\nThe team are{{efn|name=note}} sifting through a large collection of examples of regional slang words and phrases turned up by the \"Voices project\" run by the [[BBC]], in which they invited the public to send in examples of English still spoken throughout the country. The BBC Voices project also collected hundreds of news articles about how the British speak English from swearing through to items on language schools. This information will also be collated and analysed by Johnson's team both for content and for where it was reported. \"Perhaps the most remarkable finding in the Voices study is that the English language is as diverse as ever, despite our increased mobility and constant exposure to other accents and dialects through TV and radio\".<ref name=MEO/> When discussing the award of the grant in 2007, Leeds University stated:\n{{quote|that they were \"very pleased\"\u2014and indeed, \"well chuffed\"\u2014at receiving their generous grant.

However, about 2% of Britons speak with an accent called [[Received Pronunciation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/case-studies/received-pronunciation/|title=Received Pronunciation|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2017}}</ref> (also called as \"the Queen's English\", \"Oxford English\"  and \"[[BBC]] English\"<ref>BBC English because this was originally the form of English used on radio and television, although a wider variety of accents can be heard these days.</ref>), that is essentially region-less.<ref name=sweet>{{cite book |last=Sweet |first=Henry |title=The Sounds of English |work= |page=7 |url=https://archive.org/details/soundsenglishan00sweegoog  |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1908 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref name=fowler>{{cite news |last=Fowler |first=H.W. |editor=R.W.

The Cockney [[rhyming slang]] can be (and was initially intended to be) difficult for outsiders to understand,<ref name=\"Franklyn1975\">{{cite book|last=Franklyn|first=Julian|title=A dictionary of rhyming slang|year=1975|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-415-04602-5|page=9}}</ref> although the extent of its use is often somewhat exaggerated.\n\n[[Estuary English]] has been gaining prominence in recent decades: it has some features of RP and some of Cockney. In London itself, the broad local accent is still changing, partly influenced by Caribbean speech. Immigrants to the UK in recent decades have brought many more languages to the country. Surveys started in 1979 by the [[Inner London Education Authority]] discovered over 100 languages being spoken domestically by the families of the inner city's schoolchildren. As a result, [[London]]ers speak with a mixture of accents, depending on ethnicity, neighbourhood, class, age, upbringing, and sundry other factors.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nSince the mass internal [[immigration]] to [[Northamptonshire]] in the 1940s and its position between several major accent regions, it has become a source of various accent developments. In Northampton the older accent has been influenced by overspill Londoners. There is an accent known locally as the [[Kettering]] accent, which is a transitional accent between the [[East Midlands]] and [[East Anglia]]n. It is the last southern Midlands accent to use the broad \"a\" in words like ''bath''/''grass'' (i.e. barth/grarss). Conversely ''crass''/''plastic'' use a slender \"a\". A few miles northwest in Leicestershire the slender \"a\" becomes more widespread generally. In the town of [[Corby]], {{convert|5|mi|km|0|spell=in}} north, one can find Corbyite, which unlike the Kettering accent, is largely influenced by the West Scottish accent.\n\nIn addition, many British people can to some degree temporarily \"swing\" their accent towards a more neutral form of English at will, to reduce difficulty where very different accents are involved, or when speaking to foreigners.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Ethnicity===\n{{Main|Multicultural London English}}\n{{Section empty|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Features==\nPhonological features characteristic of British English revolve around the pronunciation of the letter R, as well as the dental plosive T and some diphthongs specific to this dialect.\n\n=== Glottal stop===\nIn a number of forms of spoken British English, it is common for the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}} to be realised as a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}} when it is in the intervocalic position, in a process called [[T-glottalisation]]. Once regarded as a Cockney feature, it has become much more widespread. It is still stigmatised when used in words like ''later'', but becoming very widespread at the end of words such as ''not'' (as in no{{IPA|[\u0294]}} interested).<ref name=\"Trudghill56\">{{cite book|last=Trudgill|first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Trudgill|title=Language in the British Isles|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-28409-0|pages=56\u201357}}</ref> Other consonants subject to this usage in Cockney English are ''p'', as in pa{{IPA|[\u0294]}}er and ''k'' as in ba{{IPA|[\u0294]}}er.<ref name=\"Trudghill56\" />\n\n=== R-dropping===\nIn most areas of Britain outside [[Scottish English|Scotland and Northern Ireland]], the consonant R is not pronounced if not followed by a vowel, lengthening the preceding vowel instead. This phenomenon is known as [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]].\nIn these same areas, a tendency exists to insert an R between a word ending in a vowel and a next word beginning with a vowel. This is called the [[intrusive R]]. This could be understood as a merger, in that words that once ended in an R and words that did not are no longer treated differently.\n\n=== Diphthongisation===\nBritish dialects differ on the extent of diphthongisation of long vowels, with southern varieties extensively turning them into diphthongs, and with northern dialects normally preserving many of them. As a comparison, North American varieties could be said to be in-between.\n\n==== In the south==== \nLong vowels /i\u02d0/ and /u\u02d0/ are diphthongised to [\u026ai] and [\u028au] respectively (or, more technically, [\u028f\u0289], with a raised tongue), so that '''ee''' and '''oo''' in '''feed''' and '''food''' are pronounced with a movement. The diphthong [o\u028a] is also pronounced with a greater movement, normally [\u0259\u028a], [\u0259\u0289] or [\u0259\u0268].\n\n==== In the north====\nLong vowels /i\u02d0/ and /u\u02d0/ are usually preserved, and in several areas also /o\u02d0/ and /e\u02d0/, as in '''go''' and '''say''' (unlike other varieties of English, that change them to [o\u028a] and [e\u026a] respectively). Some areas go as far as not diphthongising medieval /i\u02d0/ and /u\u02d0/, that give rise to modern /a\u026a/ and /a\u028a/; that is, for example, in the traditional accent of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], 'out' will sound as 'oot', and in parts of [[Scotland]] and North-West England, 'my' will be pronounced as 'me'.\n\n=== Loss of grammatical number in collective nouns===\nA tendency to drop [[grammatical number]] in [[collective noun]]s, stronger in British English than in North American English,<ref name=BOD>[http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2011/09/agreement-over-collective-nouns/], [[Oxford dictionary]] website, 02 April 2017.</ref> exists. This is namely treating them, that were once grammatically singular, as grammatically plural, that is: the perceived natural number prevails. This applies especially to nouns of institutions and groups made of many people.\n\nThe noun 'police', for example, undergoes this treatment:\n\n{{quote|'''Police are''' investigating the theft of work tools worth \u00a3500 from a van at the Sprucefield park and ride car park in Lisburn.<ref name=BBC1>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38547391], [[BBC]], 8 January 2017.</ref>}}\n\nA football team can be treated likewise:\n\n{{quote|Arsenal '''have''' lost just one of 20 home Premier League matches against Manchester City.<ref name=BBC2>[https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39396482], [[BBC]], 2 April 2017.</ref>}}\n\n=== Negative concord===\nSome dialects of British English use negative concords, also known as [[double negatives]]. Rather than changing a word or using a positive, words like nobody, not, nothing, and never would be used in the same sentence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/types-of-english-formal-informal-etc/double-negatives-and-usage|title=Double negatives and usage - English Grammar Today - Cambridge Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}</ref>  While this does not occur in Standard English, it does occur in non-standard dialects. The double negation follows the idea of two different morphemes, one that causes the double negation, and one that is used for the point or the verb.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://link-springer-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/content/pdf/10.1007/s10828-016-9079-4.pdf |first=Susagna |last=Tubau |title=Lexical variation and Negative Concord in Traditional Dialects of British English |publisher= |work=The Journal of Comparative Germanic Linguistics |doi=10.1007/s10828-016-9079-4.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Standardisation==\nAs with English around the world, the English language as used in the [[United Kingdom]] is governed by convention rather than formal code: there is no body equivalent to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] or the [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]].

The standardisation of British English is thought to be from both dialect leveling and a thought of social superiority. Speaking in the Standard dialect created class distinctions; those who did not speak the standard English would be considered of a lesser class or social status and often discounted or considered of a low intelligence.<ref name=\"courses.nus.edu.sg\"/>  Another contribution to the standardisation of British English was the introduction of the printing press to England in the mid-15th century. In doing so, William Caxton enabled a common language and spelling to be dispersed among the entirety of England at a much faster rate.<ref name=\"thehistoryofenglish.com\"/>\n\n[[Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language]] (1755) was a large step in the [[English-language spelling reform]], where the purification of language focused on standardising both speech and spelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Histengl/spelling.html|title=The History of English: Spelling and Standardization (Suzanne Kemmer)|website=www.ruf.rice.edu}}</ref> By the early 20th century, British authors had produced numerous books intended as guides to English grammar and usage, a few of which achieved sufficient acclaim to have remained in print for long periods and to have been reissued in new editions after some decades.

A [[war]] usually consists of multiple battles. Battles generally are well defined in duration, area, and force commitment.<ref>p.65, Dupuy</ref> A battle with only limited engagement between the forces and without decisive results is sometimes called a [[skirmish]].\n\nWars and military campaigns are guided by [[military strategy|strategy]], whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as [[operational mobility]].<ref>p.10, Glantz</ref> German strategist [[Carl von Clausewitz]] stated that \"the employment of battles ... to achieve the object of war\"<ref>translation of part quote from p.77, Clausewitz</ref> was the essence of [[strategy]].\n\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|thumb|right|400px|''The [[Battle of Waterloo]]'' by [[William Sadler (painter)|William Sadler II]]]]\n\n== Etymology ==\nBattle is a [[loanword]] from the [[Old French]] ''bataille'', first attested in 1297, from [[Late Latin]] ''battualia'', meaning \"exercise of soldiers and gladiators in fighting and fencing\", from [[Late Latin]] (taken from Germanic) ''battuere'' \"beat\", from which the English word battery is also derived via [[Middle English]] ''batri''.<ref>p.33, Tucker</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\n{{history of war}}\n\nThe defining characteristic of the fight as a concept in [[Military science]]<ref>pp. 63\u201364, Dupuy</ref> has been a dynamic one through the course of military history, changing with the changes in the organisation, employment and technology of military forces.\n\nWhile the English [[military historian]] [[John Keegan|Sir John Keegan]] suggested an ideal definition of battle as \"something which happens between two [[army|armies]] leading to the moral then physical disintegration of one or the other of them\",<ref>p.302, Keegan</ref> the origins and outcomes of battles can rarely be summarized so neatly.\n\nIn general a battle during the 20th century was, and continues to be, defined by the combat between opposing forces representing major components of total forces committed to a [[military campaign]], used to achieve specific [[military objective]]s.<ref>pp. 65\u201371, Dupuy</ref> Where the duration of the battle is longer than a week, it is often for reasons of [[Operations (military staff)|staff operational planning]] called an ''operation''. Battles can be planned, [[meeting engagement|encountered]], or forced by one force on the other when the latter is unable to [[Withdrawal (military)|withdraw]] from combat.\n\nA battle always has as its purpose the reaching of a [[mission goal]] by use of military force.<ref name = \"lbcdnv\">p.67, Dupuy</ref> A victory in the battle is achieved when one of the opposing sides forces the other to abandon its mission, or to [[surrender (military)|surrender]] its forces, or [[rout]]s the other, i.e., forces it to retreat or renders it militarily ineffective for further [[combat operation]]s. However, a battle may end in a [[Pyrrhic victory]], which ultimately favors the defeated party. If no resolution is reached in a battle, it can result in a [[No-win situation|stalemate]]. A conflict in which one side is unwilling to reach a decision by a direct battle using [[conventional warfare]] often becomes an [[insurgency]].\n\nUntil the 19th century the majority of battles were of short duration, many lasting a part of a day. (The [[Battle of Preston (1648)]], the [[Battle of Nations]] (1813) and the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] (1863) were exceptional in lasting three days.) This was mainly due to the difficulty of supplying [[Army|armies]] in the field, or conducting [[night combat|night operations]]. The means of prolonging a battle was typically by employment of [[siege warfare]]. Improvements in [[transport]]ation and the sudden evolving of [[trench warfare]], with its siege-like nature during [[World War I]] in the 20th century, lengthened the duration of battles to days and weeks.<ref name = \"lbcdnv\"/> This created the requirement for [[Tour of duty|unit rotation]] to prevent [[combat fatigue]],<ref>pp. 62\u201363, Richardson</ref> with troops preferably not remaining in a combat area of operations for more than a month. Trench warfare had become largely obsolete in conflicts between advanced armies by the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]].\n\nThe use of the term \"battle\" in military history has led to its misuse when referring to almost any scale of combat, notably by strategic forces involving hundreds of thousands of troops that may be engaged in either a single battle at one time ([[Battle of Leipzig]]) or multiple operations ([[Battle of Kursk]]). The space a battle occupies depends on the range of the [[weapon]]s of the combatants.  A \"battle\" in this broader sense may be of long duration and take place over a large area, as in the case of the [[Battle of Britain]] or the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. Until the advent of [[artillery]] and [[aircraft]], battles were fought with the two sides within sight, if not reach, of each other. The depth of the battlefield has also increased in [[modern warfare]] with inclusion of the supporting units in the rear areas; supply, artillery, medical personnel etc. often outnumber the front-line combat troops.\n\nBattles are, on the whole, made up of a multitude of individual combats, [[skirmish]]es and small [[engagement (military)|engagement]]s within the context of which the combatants will usually only experience a small part of the events of the battle's entirety. To the [[infantry]]man, there may be little to distinguish between combat as part of a minor raid or as a major offensive, nor is it likely that he anticipates the future course of the battle; few of the British infantry who went over the top on the [[first day on the Somme]], July 1, 1916, would have anticipated that they would be fighting the same battle in five months' time. Conversely, some of the Allied infantry who had just dealt a crushing defeat to the French at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] fully expected to have to fight again the next day (at the [[Battle of Wavre]]).\n\n==Battlespace==\n{{Main|Battlespace}}\nBattlespace is a unified strategy to integrate and combine [[armed forces]] for the [[military]] [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of operations]], including [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]], [[information]], [[Earth|land]], [[sea]] and [[space]]. It includes the environment, factors and conditions that must be understood to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, or complete the mission. This includes enemy and friendly [[armed forces]]; facilities; weather; terrain; and the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] within the operational areas and areas of interest.\n\n== Factors ==\nBattles are decided by various factors. The number and quality of combatants and equipment, the skill of the [[commanders]] of each army, and the terrain advantages are among the most prominent factors. A unit may charge with high morale but less discipline and still emerge victorious. This tactic was effectively used by the early [[French Revolutionary Army|French Revolutionary Armies]].\n\nWeapons and armour can be a decisive factor. On many occasions armies have achieved victories largely owing to the employment of more advanced weapons than those of their opponents. An extreme example was in the [[Battle of Omdurman]], in which a large army of Sudanese Mahdists armed in a traditional manner were destroyed by an Anglo-Egyptian force equipped with [[Maxim gun]]s.\n\nOn some occasions, simple weapons employed in an unorthodox fashion have proven advantageous, as with the [[Swiss pikemen]] who gained many victories through their ability to transform a traditionally defensive weapon into an offensive one. Likewise, the [[Zulus]] in the early 19th century were victorious in battles against their rivals in part because they adopted a new kind of spear, the [[iklwa]]. Even so, forces with inferior weapons have still emerged victorious at times, for example in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] and in the [[First Italo\u2013Ethiopian War]]. Discipline within the troops is often of greater importance; at the [[Battle of Alesia]], the Romans were greatly outnumbered but won because of superior training.\n\nBattles can also be determined by terrain. Capturing high ground, for example, has been the central strategy in innumerable battles. An army that holds the high ground forces the enemy to climb, and thus wear themselves down. Areas of dense vegetation, such as jungles and forest, act as force-multipliers, of benefit to inferior armies. Arguably, terrain is of less importance in modern warfare, due to the advent of aircraft, though terrain is still vital for camouflage, especially for [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nGenerals and commanders also play a decisive role during combat. [[Hannibal]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Khalid ibn Walid]], [[Subutai]], and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] were all skilled generals and, consequently, their armies were extremely successful. An army that can trust the commands of their leaders with conviction in its success invariably has a higher morale than an army that doubts its every move. The British in the naval [[Battle of Trafalgar]], for example, owed its success to the reputation of celebrated admiral [[Lord Nelson]].\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:Marten's Poltava.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Battle of Poltava]] between Russia and Sweden, by [[Denis Martens the Younger]] ]]\n\nBattles can be fought on land, at sea and, in the modern age, in the air. [[Naval battle]]s have occurred since before the 5th century BC. Air battles have been far less common, due to their late conception, the most prominent being the [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940. However, since the [[World War II|Second World War]] land or sea battles have come to rely on air support. Indeed, during the [[Battle of Midway]], five [[aircraft carrier]]s were sunk without either fleet coming into direct contact.\n\n[[File:Battle Scene.jpg|thumb|Battle Scene-Detail from Deccan miniature painting. c. 19th century.]]\nThere are numerous types of battles:\n\n*A ''battle of encounter'' (or ''encounter battle'') is a [[meeting engagement]] where the opposing sides collide in the field without either having prepared their attack or defence.\n*A ''battle of attrition'' aims to inflict losses on an enemy that are less sustainable compared to one's own losses.  These need not be greater numerical losses \u2013 if one side is much more numerous than the other then pursuing a strategy based on attrition can work even if casualties on both sides are about equal.  Many battles of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the First World War were intentionally ([[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]) or unintentionally ([[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme]]) attrition battles.\n*A ''battle of breakthrough'' aims to pierce the enemy's defences, thereby exposing the vulnerable flanks which can be turned.\n*A ''battle of encirclement''&mdash;the ''[[Kesselschlacht]]'' of the German ''[[Blitzkrieg]]''&mdash;surrounds the enemy in a [[Pocket (military)|pocket]].\n*A ''battle of envelopment'' involves an attack on one or both [[Flanking maneuver|flank]]s; the classic example being the double-envelopment of the [[Battle of Cannae]].\n*A ''battle of annihilation'' is one in which the defeated party is destroyed in the field, such as the French fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]].\n\nBattles frequently do not fit one particular type perfectly, and are usually hybrids of different types listed above.\n\nA ''decisive battle'' is one of particular importance; often by bringing hostilities to an end, such as the [[Battle of Hastings]] or the [[Battle of Hattin]], or as a turning point in the fortunes of the [[belligerent]]s, such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. A decisive battle can have [[political]] as well as military impact, changing the balance of power or boundaries between countries. The concept of the ''decisive battle'' became popular with the publication in 1851 of [[Edward Creasy]]'s ''[[The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World]]''. British [[military historian]]s [[J.F.C. Fuller]] (''The Decisive Battles of the Western World'') and [[B.H. Liddell Hart]] (''Decisive Wars of History''), among many others, have written books in the style of Creasy's work.\n\n=== Land ===\nThere is an obvious difference in the way battles have been fought throughout time. Early battles were probably fought between rival hunting bands as disorganized mobs. However, during the [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)|Battle of Megiddo]], the first reliably documented battle in the fifteenth century BC, actual discipline was instilled in both armies. However, during the many wars of the [[Roman Empire]], [[barbarians]] continued using [[mob tactics]].\n\nAs the [[Age of Enlightenment]] dawned, armies began to fight in highly disciplined lines. Each would follow the orders from their officers and fight as a single unit instead of individuals. Each army was successively divided into [[regiments]], [[battalions]], [[Company (military unit)|companies]], and [[platoons]]. These armies would march, line up, and fire in divisions.\n\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], on the other hand, did not fight in lines, utilizing instead guerrilla tactics. American colonists and European forces continued using disciplined lines, continuing into the [[American Civil War]].\n\nA new style, during [[World War I]], known as [[trench warfare]], developed nearly half a century later. This also led to [[radio]] for communication between battalions. [[Chemical warfare]] also emerged with the use of poisonous gas during World War I.\n\nBy [[World War II]], the use of the smaller divisions, platoons and companies became much more important as precise operations became vital. Instead of the locked trench warfare of World War I, during World War II, a dynamic network of battles developed where small groups encountered other platoons. As a result, elite squads became much more recognized and distinguishable.\n\n[[Maneuver warfare]] also developed with an astonishing pace with the advent of the [[tank]], replacing the archaic cannons of the Enlightenment Age. Artillery has since gradually replaced the use of frontal troops. Modern battles now continue to resemble those of World War II, though prominent innovations have been added. Indirect combat through the use of aircraft and missiles now constitutes a large portion of wars in place of battles, where battles are now mostly reserved for capturing cities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n=== Naval ===\n[[File:De slag bij Terheide - The Battle of Schevening - August 10 1653 (Willem van de Velde I, 1657).jpg|thumb|300px|The ''[[Battle of Scheveningen]]'' of 1653: episode from the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]].]]\nOne significant difference of modern naval battles as opposed to earlier forms of combat is the use of [[marine (military)|marines]], which introduced amphibious warfare. Today, a marine is actually an infantry regiment that sometimes fights solely on land and is no longer tied to the navy. A good example of an old naval battle is the [[Battle of Salamis]].\n\nMost ancient naval battles were fought by fast ships using the [[battering ram]] to sink opposing fleets or steer close enough for boarding in hand-to-hand combat. Troops were often used to storm enemy ships as used by [[ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[piracy|pirates]]. This tactic was usually used by civilizations that could not beat the enemy with ranged weaponry.\n\nAnother invention in the late [[Middle Ages]] was the use of [[Greek fire]] by the Byzantines, which was used to set enemy fleets on fire. Empty demolition ships utilized the tactic to crash into opposing ships and set it afire with an explosion. After the invention of cannons, naval warfare became useful as support units for land warfare.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the development of mines led to a new type of naval warfare. The [[ironclad]], first used in the [[American Civil War]], resistant to cannons, soon made the wooden ship obsolete. The invention of military [[submarine]]s, during [[World War I]], brought naval warfare to both above and below the surface. With the development of military aircraft during [[World War II]], battles were fought in the sky as well as below the ocean. [[Aircraft carriers]] have since become the central unit in naval warfare, acting as a mobile base for lethal aircraft.\n\n=== Aerial ===\nAlthough the use of aircraft has for the most part always been used as a supplement to land or naval engagements, since their first major military use in World War I aircraft have increasingly taken on larger roles in warfare. During World War I, the primary use was for reconnaissance, and small-scale bombardment.\n\nAircraft began becoming much more prominent in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and especially World War II. Aircraft design began specializing, primarily into two types: bombers, which carried explosive payloads to bomb land targets or ships; and fighter-interceptors, which were used to either intercept incoming aircraft or to escort and protect bombers (engagements between fighter aircraft were known as [[dog fights]]). Some of the more notable aerial battles in this period include the [[Battle of Britain]] and the [[Battle of Midway]].\n\nAnother important use of aircraft came with the development of the [[helicopter]], which first became heavily used during the Vietnam War, and still continues to be widely used today to transport and augment ground forces.\n\nToday, direct engagements between aircraft are rare \u2013 the most modern fighter-interceptors carry much more extensive bombing payloads, and are used to bomb precision land targets, rather than to fight other aircraft. Anti-aircraft batteries are used much more extensively to defend against incoming aircraft than interceptors. Despite this, aircraft today are much more extensively used as the primary tools for both army and navy, as evidenced by the prominent use of helicopters to transport and support troops, the use of aerial bombardment as the \"first strike\" in many engagements, and the replacement of the battleship with the aircraft carrier as the center of most modern navies.\n\n== Naming ==\n[[File:Battle of Gibraltar 1607.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]]'' of 1607 by [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]].]]\n\nBattles are usually named after some feature of the battlefield [[geography]], such as the name of a town, forest or river, commonly prefixed \"Battle of...\". Occasionally battles are named after the date on which they took place, such as [[The Glorious First of June]].\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]] it was considered important to settle on a suitable name for a battle which could be used by the [[chronicler]]s. For example, after [[Henry V of England]] defeated a French army on October 25, 1415, he met with the senior French [[herald]] and they agreed to name the battle after the nearby [[castle]] and so it was called the [[Battle of Agincourt]].\n\nIn other cases, the sides adopted different names for the same battle, such as the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] which is known in Turkey as the [[Battle of \u00c7anakkale]]. During the American Civil War, the Union tended to name the battles after the nearest watercourse, such as the Battle of Wilsons Creek and the Battle of Stones River, whereas the Confederates favoured the nearby towns, as in the Battles of Chancellorsville and Murfreesboro. Occasionally both names for the same battle entered the popular culture, such as the [[First Battle of Bull Run|First]] and [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], which are also referred to as the First and Second Battle of Manassas.\n\nSometimes in desert warfare, there is no nearby town name to use; map coordinates gave the name to the [[Battle of 73 Easting]] in the [[First Gulf War]].\n\nSome place names have become [[synonymous]] with the battles that took place there, such as the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], [[Battle of the Alamo|the Alamo]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], or [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].  [[Military operation]]s, many of which result in battle, are given [[codename]]s, which are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of the type or the location of the battle. [[Operation Market Garden]] and [[Operation Rolling Thunder]] are examples of battles known by their military codenames.\n\nWhen a battleground is the site of more than one battle in the same conflict, the instances are distinguished by [[ordinal number]], such as the [[First Battle of Bull Run|First]] and [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Battles of Bull Run]]. An extreme case are the twelve [[Battles of the Isonzo]]&mdash;[[First Battle of the Isonzo|First]] to [[Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo|Twelfth]]&mdash;between Italy and [[Austria-Hungary]] during the First World War.\n\nSome battles are named for the convenience of [[military historian]]s so that periods of combat can be neatly distinguished from one another. Following the First World War, the British Battles Nomenclature Committee was formed to decide on standard names for all battles and subsidiary actions. To the soldiers who did the fighting, the distinction was usually academic; a soldier fighting at [[Beaumont Hamel]] on November 13, 1916 was probably unaware he was taking part in what the committee would call the \"[[Battle of the Ancre]]\".\n\nMany combats are too small to merit a name. Terms such as \"action\", \"skirmish\", \"firefight\", \"raid\" or \"offensive patrol\" are used to describe small-scale battle-like encounters. These combats often take place within the time and space of a battle and while they may have an objective, they are not necessarily \"decisive\". Sometimes the soldiers are unable to immediately gauge the significance of the combat; in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Waterloo]], some British officers were in doubt as to whether the day's events merited the title of \"battle\" or would be passed off as merely an \"action\".{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n== Effects ==\nBattles affect the individuals who take part, as well as the political actors. Personal effects of battle range from mild psychological issues to permanent and crippling injuries. Some battle-survivors have nightmares about the conditions they encountered, or abnormal reactions to certain sights or sounds. Some suffer [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]]. Physical effects of battle can include scars, amputations, lesions, loss of bodily functions, blindness, paralysis \u2014 and death.\n\nBattles also affect [[politics]]. A decisive battle can cause the losing side to surrender, while a [[Pyrrhic victory]] such as the [[Battle of Asculum]] can cause the winning side to reconsider its long-term goals. Battles in [[civil war]]s have often decided the fate of monarchs or political factions. Famous examples include the [[Wars of the Roses]], as well as the [[Jacobite risings]]. Battles also affect the commitment of one side or the other to the continuance of a war, for example the [[Battle of Inchon]] and the [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf]] during the [[Tet Offensive]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of battles]]\n*[[Military strategy]]\n*[[Military tactics]]\n*[[Naval battle]]\n*[[Pitched battle]]\n*[[Skirmisher]]\n*[[War]]\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Battles}}\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n;Sources\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|title=Official Names of the Battles and Other Engagements Fought by the Military Forces of the British Empire During the Great War, 1914\u20131919, and the Third Afghan War, 1919|publisher=The Naval & Military Press|author=Great Britain Battles Nomenclature Committee (1919\u20131921)|origyear=1922|year=1993|isbn=1-897632-06-1}}\n*{{cite book |authorlink=Carl von Clausewitz |last=von Clausewitz |first=Carl |title=Bemerkungen \u00fcber die reine und angewandte Strategie des Herrn von B\u00fclow oder Kritik der darin enthaltenen Ansichten |publisher=Verstreute [[kleine Schriften]] |editor=Hahlweg, Werner |language=German}} (Osnabr\u00fcck: Biblio Verlag, 1979), 77.\n*{{cite book|authorlink=Trevor N.

A '''botanist''', '''plant scientist''' or '''phytologist''' is a [[scientist]] who specialises in this field. The term \"botany\" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7}} (''botan\u0113'') meaning \"[[pasture]]\", \"[[Poaceae|grass]]\", or \"[[fodder]]\"; {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7}} is in turn derived from {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} (''boskein''), \"to feed\" or \"to [[Grazing|graze]]\".{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1940}}{{sfn|Gordh|Headrick|2001|p = 134}}{{sfn|Online Etymology Dictionary|2012}}  Traditionally, botany has also included the study of [[fungus|fungi]] and [[algae]] by [[mycology|mycologists]] and [[phycology|phycologists]] respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the [[International Botanical Congress]]. Nowadays, botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately 410,000 [[species]] of [[Embryophyte|land plants]] of which some 391,000 species are [[vascular plant]]s (including ca 369,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s),<ref>RBG Kew (2016).

Medieval [[physic garden]]s, often attached to [[Monastery|monasteries]], contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first [[botanical garden]]s attached to [[University|universities]], founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]]. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of [[plant taxonomy]], and led in 1753 to the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system]] of [[Carl Linnaeus]] that remains in use to this day.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, new techniques were developed for the study of plants, including methods of [[optical microscope|optical microscopy]] and [[live cell imaging]], [[electron microscopy]], analysis of [[ploidy|chromosome number]], [[phytochemistry|plant chemistry]] and the structure and function of [[enzyme]]s and other [[protein]]s. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of [[molecular biology|molecular genetic analysis]], including [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] and [[DNA sequences]] to classify plants more accurately.\n\nModern botany is a broad, multidisciplinary subject with inputs from most other areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant [[Plant morphology|structure]], [[cell growth|growth]] and differentiation, [[Plant reproduction|reproduction]], [[plant physiology#Biochemistry of plants|biochemistry]] and [[metabolism|primary metabolism]], [[phytochemistry|chemical products]], [[Plant morphology#Development|development]], [[plant pathology|diseases]], [[phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]], [[systematics]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|plant taxonomy]]. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are [[molecular genetics]] and [[epigenetics]], which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of [[plant cell]]s and [[Tissue (biology)#Plant tissues|tissues]]. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing [[staple foods]], materials such as [[Lumber|timber]], [[oil]], rubber, [[Fiber|fibre]] and drugs, in modern [[horticulture]], [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]], [[plant propagation]], [[Plant breeding|breeding]] and [[genetic modification]], in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in [[environmental management]], and the maintenance of [[biodiversity]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of botany}}\n\n=== Early botany ===\n[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|alt=engraving of cork cells from Hooke's Micrographia, 1665|An engraving of the cells of [[Cork oak|cork]], from [[Robert Hooke]]'s ''[[Micrographia]]'', 1665]]\n\nBotany originated as [[herbalism]], the study and use of plants for their medicinal properties.{{sfn|Sumner|2000|p = 16}} Many records of the [[Holocene]] period date early botanical knowledge as far back as 10,000 years ago.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Delcourt|first=Paul A.|last2=Delcourt|first2=Hazel R.|last3=Cridlebaugh|first3=Patricia A.|last4=Chapman|first4=Jefferson|date=1986-05-01|title=Holocene ethnobotanical and paleoecological record of human impact on vegetation in the Little Tennessee River Valley, Tennessee|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0033589486900050|journal=Quaternary Research|volume=25|issue=3|pages=330\u2013349|doi=10.1016/0033-5894(86)90005-0|bibcode=1986QuRes..25..330D}}</ref> This early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within [[Tennessee]], which make up much of the [[Cherokee]] land today.<ref name=\":0\" /> The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications.

''De Materia Medica'' was widely read for more than 1,500 years.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|p = 532}} Important contributions from the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Muslim world]] include [[Ibn Wahshiyya]]'s ''Nabatean Agriculture'', [[Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfa D\u012bnawar\u012b]]'s (828\u2013896) the ''Book of Plants'', and [[Ibn Bassal]]'s ''The Classification of Soils''. In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and [[Ibn al-Baitar]] (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.{{sfn|Dallal|2010|p = 197}}{{sfn|Panaino|2002|p = 93}}{{sfn|Levey|1973|p = 116}}\n\nIn the mid-16th century, \"[[botanical garden]]s\" were founded in a number of Italian universities \u2013 the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]] in 1545 is usually considered to be the first which is still in its original location. These gardens continued the practical value of earlier \"physic gardens\", often associated with monasteries, in which plants were cultivated for medical use. They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject. Lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens and their medical uses demonstrated. Botanical gardens came much later to northern Europe; the first in England was the [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden]] in 1621. Throughout this period, botany remained firmly subordinate to medicine.{{sfn|Hill|1915}}\n\nGerman physician [[Leonhart Fuchs]] (1501\u20131566) was one of \"the three German fathers of botany\", along with theologian [[Otto Brunfels]] (1489\u20131534) and physician [[Hieronymus Bock]] (1498\u20131554) (also called Hieronymus Tragus).{{sfn|National Museum of Wales|2007}}{{sfn|Yaniv|Bachrach|2005|p = 157}} Fuchs and Brunfels broke away from the tradition of copying earlier works to make original observations of their own. Bock created his own system of plant classification.\n\nPhysician [[Valerius Cordus]] (1515\u20131544) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal ''Historia Plantarum'' in 1544 and a [[pharmacopoeia]] of lasting importance, the ''Dispensatorium'' in 1546.{{sfn|Sprague|1939}} Naturalist [[Conrad von Gesner]] (1516\u20131565) and herbalist [[John Gerard]] (1545\u2013c. 1611) published herbals covering the medicinal uses of plants. Naturalist [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] (1522\u20131605) was considered the ''father of natural history'', which included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, [[Polymath]] [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[cell (biology)|cells]], a term he coined, in [[cork (material)|cork]], and a short time later in living plant tissue.{{sfn|Waggoner|2001}}\n\n=== Early modern botany ===\n{{Further|Taxonomy (biology)#History of taxonomy}}\n[[File:CarlvonLinne Garden.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a garden|The [[Linnaean Garden]] of Linnaeus' residence in Uppsala, Sweden, was planted according to his ''Systema sexuale''.]]\n\nDuring the 18th century, systems of [[plant identification]] were developed comparable to [[single access key|dichotomous keys]], where unidentified plants are placed into [[taxon]]omic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) by making a series of choices between pairs of [[Character (biology)|characters]]. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification ([[single access key#Diagnostic ('artificial') versus synoptic ('natural') keys|diagnostic keys]]) or more closely related to the natural or [[taxonomic order|phyletic order]] of the [[taxon|taxa]] in synoptic keys.{{sfn|Scharf|2009|pp = 73\u2013117}} By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753, [[Carl Linnaeus|Carl von Linn\u00e9]] (Carl Linnaeus) published his [[Species Plantarum]], a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|modern botanical nomenclature]]. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the [[genus]] and the second identified the [[species]] within the genus.{{sfn|Capon|2005|pp = 220\u2013223}} For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's ''Systema Sexuale'' [[Linnaean taxonomy#Classification for plants|classified]] plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, ''Cryptogamia'', included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.{{sfn|Hoek|Mann|Jahns|2005|p = 9}}\n\nIncreasing knowledge of [[plant anatomy]], [[plant morphology|morphology]] and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. [[Michel Adanson|Adanson]] (1763), [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), and [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|Candolle]] (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The [[Candollean system]] reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the [[Bentham & Hooker system|later classification]] by [[George Bentham|Bentham]] and [[J.D. Hooker|Hooker]], which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach.

[[Gregor Mendel]] discovered the [[Mendelian inheritance|genetic laws of inheritance]] by studying inherited traits such as shape in ''Pisum sativum'' ([[peas]]).

The formation of stem [[tuber]]s in potato is one example. Particularly in [[arctic]] or [[alpine climate|alpine]] habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers [[zoophily|by animals]] are rare, plantlets or [[bulbs]], may develop instead of flowers, replacing [[sexual reproduction]] with [[asexual reproduction]] and giving rise to [[cloning|clonal populations]] genetically identical to the parent. This is one of several types of [[apomixis]] that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a [[seed]], producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.{{sfn|Savidan|2000|pp = 13\u201386}}\n\nMost [[sexually reproducing]] organisms are diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their [[chromosome number]] may occur due to errors in [[cell division|cytokinesis]]. This can occur early in development to produce an [[autopolyploid]] or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid ([[endopolyploidy]]), or during [[gamete]] formation. An [[allopolyploid]] plant may result from a [[hybridization event|hybridisation event]] between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are [[reproductively isolated]] from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new [[sympatric speciation|species]].{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 495\u2013496}} Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce [[vegetative propagation|vegetatively]] or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 495\u2013496}} [[Durum]] wheat is a fertile [[tetraploid]] allopolyploid, while [[common wheat|bread wheat]] is a fertile [[hexaploid]].

[[Taraxacum officinale|Common dandelion]] is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.\n\nAs in other eukaryotes, the inheritance of [[endosymbiotic]] organelles like [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s in plants is non-[[Mendelian]].

Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to [[silencer (DNA)|silencer]] regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code. Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive [[cell division]]s for the remainder of the cell's life. Some epigenetic changes have been shown to be [[Heritability|heritable]],{{sfn|Spector|2012|p = 8}} while others are reset in the germ cells.\n\nEpigenetic changes in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] biology serve to regulate the process of [[cellular differentiation]]. During [[morphogenesis]], [[totipotent]] [[stem cells]] become the various [[pluripotent]] [[cell line]]s of the [[embryo]], which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the [[zygote]], gives rise to the many different [[plant cell]] types including [[parenchyma]], [[vessel element|xylem vessel elements]], [[phloem]] sieve tubes, [[guard cell]]s of the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]], etc. as it continues to [[mitosis|divide]].

Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as [[genus|genera]] or [[species]]. Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific taxonomy]]. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]] \u2013 grouping organisms by ancestry rather than [[phenotype|superficial characteristics]]. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) and administered by the [[International Botanical Congress]].{{sfn|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2011|p = Preamble, para. 7}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013551}}\n\n[[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]] [[Plant]]ae belongs to [[Domain (biology)|Domain]] [[Eukarya]] and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is: [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]; [[Phylum]] (or Division); [[Class (biology)|Class]]; [[Order (biology)|Order]]; [[Family (biology)|Family]]; [[Genus]] (plural ''genera''); [[Species]]. The scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013551}} For example, the tiger lily is ''[[Lilium columbianum]]''. ''Lilium'' is the genus, and ''columbianum'' the [[Botanical name#Binary name|specific epithet]]. The combination is the name of the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u201355}}{{sfn|International Association for Plant Taxonomy|2006}}{{sfn|Silyn-Roberts|2000|p = 198}}\n\nThe evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called its [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]]. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 438\u2013444}} As an example, species of ''[[Pereskia]]'' are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless [[cactus]] such as an ''[[Echinocactus]]''. However, both ''Pereskia'' and ''Echinocactus'' have spines produced from [[areoles]] (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 446\u2013449}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp = 26\u201327}}\n\n{{Multiple image|float=right\n|title=Two cacti of very different appearance\n|total_width=400\n|width1=3872|height1=2592|image1=Pereskia aculeata5.jpg|caption1=''Pereskia aculeata''\n|width2=4288|height2=3216|image2=Bogarub-echinocactus-grusonii-1.jpg|caption2=''Echinocactus grusonii''\n|footer=Although ''Pereskia'' is a tree with leaves, it has spines and areoles like a more typical cactus, such as ''Echinocactus''.}}\nJudging relationships based on shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through [[convergent evolution]] in which characters have arisen independently. Some [[euphorbia]]s have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The [[Cladistics|cladistic method]] takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history \u2013 such as those evolved separately in different groups ([[homoplasies]]) or those left over from ancestors ([[plesiomorphies]]) \u2013 and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor ([[apomorphies]]). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as [[cladogram]]s: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 442\u2013450}}\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses molecular characters, particularly [[DNA]] sequences, rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles. The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. [[Clive A. Stace|Clive Stace]] describes this as having \"direct access to the genetic basis of evolution.\"{{sfn|Stace|2010a|p = 104}} As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals. Genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below \u2013 fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|p = 453}}\n\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px; \">{{clade\n|1={{clade\n   |1='''plants'''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1='''fungi'''\n      |2='''animals'''\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n</div>\n\nIn 1998, the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] published a [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] for flowering plants based on an analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As a result of this work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of [[angiosperms]], have now been answered.{{sfn|Burger|2013}} Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants.{{sfn|Chase et al.|2003|pp = 399\u2013436}} Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various [[Taxon|taxa]].{{sfn|Capon|2005|p = 223}} Technological developments such as computers and [[electron microscope]]s have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.{{sfn|Morton|1981|pp = 459\u2013459}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=17em}}\n* [[Branches of botany]]\n* [[Evolution of plants]]\n* [[Glossary of botanical terms]]\n* [[Glossary of plant morphology]]\n* [[List of botany journals]]\n* [[List of botanists]]\n* [[List of botanical gardens]]\n* [[List of botanists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[List of domesticated plants]]\n* [[List of flowers]]\n* [[List of systems of plant taxonomy]]\n* [[Outline of botany]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|16em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | last1 = Acharya | first1 = Deepak | last2 = Anshu | first2 = Shrivastava | title = Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-81-7910-252-7 | publisher = Aavishkar Publishers | location = Jaipur, India}}\n* {{cite web | ref = {{sfnRef|Addelson|2003}} |last = Addelson |first = Barbara | url = http://www.bgci.org/education/article/414/ | title = Natural Science Institute in Botany and Ecology for Elementary Teachers | publisher = Botanical Gardens Conservation International | date = December 2003| accessdate = June 8, 2013}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Anderson |first=Edward F. |year=2001 |title=The Cactus Family |publication-place=Pentland, Oregon |publisher=Timber Press |isbn=978-0-88192-498-5}}\n* {{cite journal|ref=harv |last1=Armstrong|first1=G.

Phages are classified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) according to [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and nucleic acid.\n\nNineteen families are currently recognized by the ICTV that infect [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Of these, only two families have RNA genomes, and only five families are surrounded by an envelope. Of the viral families with DNA genomes, only two have single-stranded genomes. Eight of the viral families with DNA genomes have circular genomes while nine have linear genomes. Nine families infect bacteria only, nine infect archaea only, and one (''Tectiviridae'') infects both bacteria and archaea.\n\n[[File:Bacteriophage P22 Casjens Lenk.png|thumb|right|Bacteriophage P22, a member of the ''[[Podoviridae]]'' by morphology due to its short, non-contractile tail]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ '''ICTV classification of prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) viruses'''<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n|- style=\"background:gray;\"\n!Order !!

With ''lytic phages'' such as the [[T4 phage]], bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. As soon as the cell is destroyed, the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect. Lytic phages are more suitable for [[phage therapy]]. Some lytic phages undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition, where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate phage]] going dormant and is usually temporary.\n\nIn contrast, the ''[[lysogenic cycle]]'' does not result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as [[temperate phage]]s. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it relatively harmlessly, or may even become established as a [[plasmid]]. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients; then, the [[endogenous]] phages (known as [[prophage]]s) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is replicated in all of the cell\u2019s offspring.\nAn example of a bacteriophage known to follow the lysogenic cycle and the lytic cycle is the [[phage lambda]] of ''E. coli.''<ref>Mason, Kenneth A., Jonathan B. Losos, Susan R. Singer, Peter H Raven, and George B. Johnson. (2011). ''Biology'', p. 533. McGraw-Hill, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-07-893649-4}}.</ref>\n\nSometimes prophages may provide benefits to the host bacterium while they are dormant by adding new functions to the bacterial [[genome]] in a phenomenon called [[lysogenic conversion]]. Examples are the conversion of harmless strains of ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'' or ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' by bacteriophages to highly virulent ones, which cause [[diphtheria]] or [[cholera]], respectively.<ref name=\"pmid19007916\">{{cite journal |author=Mokrousov I |title=Corynebacterium diphtheriae: genome diversity, population structure and genotyping perspectives |journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201315 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19007916 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.09.011 |url=}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid21799407\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Charles RC, Ryan ET |title=Cholera in the 21st century |journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=472\u20137 |date=October 2011 |pmid=21799407 |doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834a88af |url=}}</ref> Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these toxin-encoding prophages have been proposed.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Keen | first1 = E.

After making contact with the appropriate receptor, the tail fibers flex to bring the base plate closer to the surface of the cell; this is known as reversible binding. Once attached completely, irreversible binding is initiated and the tail contracts, possibly with the help of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] present in the tail,<ref name=\"Prescott\" /> injecting genetic material through the bacterial membrane. The injection is done through a sort of bending motion in the shaft by going to the side, contracting closer to the cell and pushing back up.\nPodoviruses lack an elongated tail sheath similar to that of a myovirus, so they instead use their small, tooth-like tail fibers enzymatically to degrade a portion of the cell membrane before inserting their genetic material.\n\n=== Synthesis of proteins and nucleic acid ===\nWithin minutes, bacterial [[ribosome]]s start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages, [[RNA replicase]] is synthesized early in the process. Proteins modify the bacterial [[RNA polymerase]] so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host\u2019s normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on to become part of new virions within the cell, helper proteins that help assemble the new virions, or proteins involved in cell [[lysis]]. [[Walter Fiers]] ([[University of Ghent]], [[Belgium]]) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene (1972) and of the viral genome of [[bacteriophage MS2]] (1976).<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Fiers | first1 = W.\n| last2 = Contreras | first2 = R.\n| last3 = Duerinck | first3 = F.\n| last4 = Haegeman | first4 = G.\n| last5 = Iserentant | first5 = D.\n| last6 = Merregaert | first6 = J.\n| last7 = Min Jou | first7 = W.\n| last8 = Molemans | first8 = F.\n| last9 = Raeymaekers | first9 = A.\n| doi = 10.1038/260500a0\n| last10 = Van Den Berghe | first10 = A.\n| last11 = Volckaert | first11 = G.\n| last12 = Ysebaert | first12 = M.\n| title = Complete nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage MS2 RNA: primary and secondary structure of the replicase gene\n| journal = Nature\n| volume = 260\n| issue = 5551\n| pages = 500\u2013507\n| year = 1976\n| pmid =  1264203| pmc =\n|bibcode = 1976Natur.260..500F }}</ref>\n\n=== Virion assembly ===\nIn the case of the [[T4 phage]], the construction of new virus particles involves the assistance of helper proteins. The base plates are assembled first, with the tails being built upon them afterward. The head capsids, constructed separately, will spontaneously assemble with the tails. The DNA is packed efficiently within the heads. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.\n[[File:Tevenphage.svg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of a typical tailed bacteriophage structure]]\n\n=== Release of virions ===\nPhages may be released via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, in a few cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called [[endolysin]], which attacks and breaks down the cell wall [[peptidoglycan]]. An altogether different phage type, the [[filamentous phage]]s, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a [[lysogenic]] cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as [[prophage]].\n\n== Genome structure ==\nGiven the millions of different phages in the environment, phages' genomes come in a variety of forms and sizes. RNA phage such as [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] have the smallest genomes of only a few kilobases. However, some DNA phages such as [[Enterobacteria phage T4|T4]] may have large genomes with hundreds of genes; the size and shape of the [[capsid]] varies along with the size of the genome.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Black|first1=LW|last2=Thomas|first2=JA|title=Condensed genome structure|date=2012|volume=726|pages=469\u201387|pmid=22297527|pmc=3559133|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-0980-9_21|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|isbn=978-1-4614-0979-3}}</ref>\n\nBacteriophage genomes can be highly [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]], i.e. the genome of many phage species appear to be composed of numerous individual modules.

As a consequence, the transcription pattern of the infected bacterium may change considerably. For instance, infection of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' by the temperate phage PaP3 changed the expression of 38% (2160/5633) of its host's genes.

The supposed superiority of bactericidal agents over bacteriostatic agents is of little relevance when treating the vast majority of infections with [[gram-positive bacteria]], particularly in patients with uncomplicated infections and noncompromised immune systems. Bacteriostatic agents have been effectively used for treatment that are considered to require bactericidal activity. Furthermore, some broad classes of antibacterial agents considered bacteriostatic can exhibit bactericidal activity against some bacteria on the basis of in vitro determination of MBC/MIC values. At high concentrations, bacteriostatic agents are often bactericidal against some susceptible organisms. The ultimate guide to treatment of any infection must be clinical outcome.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of antibiotics]]\n* [[Microbicide]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Pharmacology}}\n\n[[Category:Bactericides| ]]", "sha1": "cfbpfbz02acgmfoch5r5hhxm1rz6o7m"}}, {"title": "Brion Gysin", "ns": "0", "id": "4188", "revision": {"id": "866615856", "parentid": "861769597", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T12:54:38Z", "contributor": {"username": "Frietjes", "id": "13791031"}, "comment": "update template syntax", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n| name        = Brion Gysin\n| image       = Brion Gysin.jpg\n| imagesize   = \n| caption     = \n| birth_name  = John Clifford Brian Gysin \n| birth_date  = 19 January 1916\n| birth_place = [[Taplow]], England\n| death_date  = {{death date and age|1986|7|13|1916|1|19|df=y}}\n| death_place = [[Paris]], France\n| occupation  = Painter, writer, poet\n| nationality = British/Canadian\n| movement    = [[Beat Generation|Beat]], [[Postmodern]], [[Asemic writing]]\n| education     = [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], [[Downside School]]\n}}\n\n'''Brion Gysin'''  (19 January 1916 \u2013 13 July 1986) was a [[Painting|painter]], writer, [[sound poet]], and [[performance artist]] born in [[Taplow]], [[Buckinghamshire]].<ref name=\"Geiger\">{{cite book | last=Geiger | first=John | title=Nothing Is True - Everything Is Permitted: The Life of Brion Gysin | publisher=The Disinformation Company | year=2005 | pages=130 | isbn=1-932857-12-5}}</ref>\n\nHe is best known for his discovery of the [[cut-up technique]], used by his friend, the novelist [[William S.

His mother, Stella Margaret Martin, was a Canadian from [[Deseronto, Ontario]]. His father, Leonard Gysin, a captain with the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]], was killed in action eight months after his son's birth. Stella returned to Canada and settled in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] where her son became \"the only Catholic day-boy at an Anglican boarding school\".<ref>Cf.

Despite, or because of, attending a Catholic school, Gysin became an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nothing Is True-Everything is Permitted: The Life of Brion Gysin|year=2005|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|isbn=9781609258719|page=5|author=John Geiger|quote=Brion's view of Creating soon changed.

John Geiger, 'Brion Gysin: His Life and Times' in ''Brion Gysin: Tuning into the Multimedia Age'', p. 204.</ref> He joined the Surrealist Group and began frequenting [[Valentine Hugo]], [[Leonor Fini]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Picasso]] and [[Dora Maar]]. A year later, he had his first exhibition at the ''Galerie Quatre Chemins'' in Paris with Ernst, Picasso, [[Hans Arp]], [[Hans Bellmer]], [[Victor Brauner]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], Dal\u00ed, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]], [[Man Ray]] and [[Yves Tanguy]]. On the day of the preview, however, he was expelled from the Surrealist Group by [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], who ordered the poet [[Paul \u00c9luard]] to take down his pictures. Gysin was 19 years old. His biographer, John Geiger, suggests the arbitrary expulsion \"had the effect of a curse. Years later, he blamed other failures on the Breton incident. It gave rise to conspiracy theories about the powerful interests who seek control of the art world. He gave various explanations for the expulsion, the more elaborate involving 'insubordination' or ''l\u00e8se majest\u00e9'' towards Breton\".<ref name = \"fmmdmv\"/>\n\n===After World War II===\nAfter serving in the U.S. army during World War II, Gysin published a biography of [[Josiah Henson|Josiah \"Uncle Tom\" Henson]] titled, ''To Master, a Long Goodnight: The History of Slavery in Canada'' (1946). A gifted draughtsman, he took an 18-month course learning the Japanese language (including calligraphy) that would greatly influence his artwork. In 1949, he was among the first [[Fulbright Fellow]]s. His goal: to research the history of slavery at the University of Bordeaux and in the [[Archivo de Indias]] in Seville, Spain, a project that he later abandoned. He moved to [[Tangier]], Morocco after visiting the city with novelist and composer [[Paul Bowles]] in 1950. In 1952/3 he met the travel writer and sexual adventurer [[Anne Cumming]] and they remained friends until his death.<ref name=cum>Richard Davenport-Hines, \u2018Cumming, (Felicity) Anne (1917\u20131993)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51816, accessed 11 April 2017]</ref>\n\n===Morocco and the Beat Hotel===\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical\n|width=250\n|align=left\n|lines=\n|image1=P1210673 Paris VI rue Git-le-Coeur n9 ancien Beat hotel rwk.jpg|caption1=Rue Git-le-Coeur, Paris; site of Beat Hotel\n|image2=Plaque Beat Hotel, 9 rue G\u00eet-le-C\u0153ur, Paris 6.jpg|caption2=Plaque commemorating site of Beat Hotel \n}}\nIn 1954 in Tangier, Gysin opened a restaurant called The 1001 Nights, with his friend [[Mohamed Hamri]], who was the cook. Gysin hired the [[Master Musicians of Jajouka]] from the village of Jajouka to perform alongside entertainment that included acrobats, a dancing boy and fire eaters.<ref>Greene, Michelle, ''The Dream at the End of the World'', (New York, 1991), p. 123, p. 201</ref><ref>Geiger, John, ''Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted: the Life of Brion Gysin'', (New York, 2005), p. 103</ref> The musicians performed there for an international clientele that included William S. Burroughs. Gysin lost the business in 1958,<ref>In his essay \"Cut-Ups: A Project for Disastrous Success,\" Gysin explains that \"on January 5, 1958, I lost the business over a signature given to a friendly American couple who 'wanted to help me out.' I was out with the shirt on my back.\" in ''A Williams Burroughs Reader'', ed. John Calder (London: Picador, 1982), p. 276.</ref> and the restaurant closed permanently. That same year, Gysin returned to Paris, taking lodgings in a flophouse located at 9 rue G\u00eet-le-Coeur that would become famous as the [[Beat Hotel]]. Working on a drawing, he discovered a [[Dada]] technique by accident:\n\n<blockquote>\nWilliam Burroughs and I first went into techniques of writing, together, back in room No. 15 of the Beat Hotel during the cold Paris spring of 1958... Burroughs was more intent on Scotch-taping his photos together into one great continuum on the wall, where scenes faded and slipped into one another, than occupied with editing the monster manuscript... ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' appeared and Burroughs disappeared. He kicked his habit with [[Apomorphine]] and flew off to London to see Dr Dent, who had first turned him on to the cure. While cutting a mount for a drawing in room No. 15, I sliced through a pile of newspapers with my [[Stanley knife|Stanley blade]] and thought of what I had said to Burroughs some six months earlier about the necessity for turning painters' techniques directly into writing. I picked up the raw words and began to piece together texts that later appeared as \"First Cut-Ups\" in  ''Minutes to Go'' (Two Cities, Paris 1960).<ref>Brion Gysin: ''Cut-Ups: A Project for Disastrous Success'', published in ''Evergreen Review'' and much later in ''[Brion Gysin] Let the Mice In'', Something Else Press, West Clover 1973; also in the ''A Williams Burroughs Reader'', John Calder (editor), Picador, London 1982, p. 272.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen Burroughs returned from London in September 1959, Gysin not only shared his discovery with his friend but the new techniques he had developed for it. Burroughs then put the techniques to use while completing ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' and the experiment dramatically changed the landscape of [[American literature]]. Gysin helped Burroughs with the editing of several of his novels including ''[[Interzone (book)|Interzone]]'', and wrote a script for a film version of ''Naked Lunch'', which was never produced. The pair collaborated on a large manuscript for [[Grove Press]] titled ''[[The Third Mind]]'' but it was determined that it would be impractical to publish it as originally envisioned. The book later published under that title incorporates little of this material. Interviewed for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1997, Burroughs explained that Gysin was \"the only man that I've ever respected in my life. I've admired people, I've liked them, but he's the only man I've ever respected.\" <ref>''The Guardian'', January 18, 1997.</ref> In 1969, Gysin completed his finest novel, ''[[The Process (novel)|The Process]]'', a work judged by critic Robert Palmer as \"a classic of 20th century modernism\".<ref>From Palmer's forward to the novel published by The Overlook Press in 1987.</ref>\n\nA consummate innovator, Gysin altered the cut-up technique to produce what he called permutation poems in which a single phrase was repeated several times with the words rearranged in a different order with each reiteration. An example of this is \"I don't dig work, man/Man, work I don't dig.\"  Many of these permutations were derived using a random sequence generator in an early computer program written by [[Ian Sommerville (technician)|Ian Sommerville]]. Commissioned by the [[BBC]] in 1960 to produce material for broadcast, Gysin's results included \"Pistol Poem\", which was created by recording a gun firing at different distances and then splicing the sounds. That year, the piece was subsequently used as a theme for the Paris performance of [[Le Domaine Poetique]], a showcase for experimental works by people like Gysin, [[Fran\u00e7ois Dufr\u00eane]], [[Bernard Heidsieck]], and [[Henri Chopin]].\n\nWith Sommerville, he built the [[Dreamachine]] in 1961. Described as \"the first art object to be seen with the eyes closed\",<ref>Quoted on coverflap of ''Tuning in to the Multimedia Age''.</ref> the flicker device uses [[alpha waves]] in the 8-16 [[Hertz|Hz]] range to produce a change of consciousness in receptive viewers.\n\n===Later years===\n\nIn 1985 Gysin was made an American Commander of the French [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]. He'd begun to work extensively with noted [[jazz]] soprano saxophonist [[Steve Lacy]]. They recorded an album in 1986 with French musician Ramuntcho Matta, featuring Gysin singing/rapping his own texts, with performances by Lacy, [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], [[Elli Medeiros]], [[Lizzy Mercier Descloux]] and more. The album was reissued on CD in 1993 by [[Crammed Discs]], under the title ''Self-Portrait Jumping''.\n\nOn July 13, 1986 Brion Gysin died of [[lung cancer]]. Anne Cumming arranged his funeral and for his ashes to be scattered at the [[Caves of Hercules]] in Morocco.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://ebsn.eu/scholarship/interviews/felicity-masonanne-cumming-a-brief-biography-and-interview-jennie-skerl/|title=Felicity Mason/Anne Cumming \u2013 A Brief Biography and Interview \u2013 Jennie Skerl|date=2012-10-16|work=[[European Beat Studies Network]]|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US}}</ref> An obituary by Robert Palmer published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him as a man who \"threw off the sort of ideas that ordinary artists would parlay into a lifetime career, great clumps of ideas, as casually as a locomotive throws off sparks\".<ref>Cf. John Geiger, 'Brion Gysin: His Life and Times' in ''Brion Gysin: Tuning into the Multimedia Age'', p. 227.</ref> Later that year a heavily edited version of his novel, ''The Last Museum'', was published posthumously by [[Faber & Faber]] (London) and by [[Grove Press]] (New York).\n\nAs a joke, Gysin had contributed a recipe for [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] fudge to a cookbook by [[Alice B. Toklas]]; it was unintentionally included for publication, becoming famous under the name [[Alice B. Toklas brownie]]s.<ref>Biographer John Geiger writes that Gysin's restaurant, ''The 1001 Nights'' provided him \"with an entr\u00e9e into Tangiers society. His Moroccan culinary delights even merited an entry in Alice B. Toklas's famous cookbook, with a recipe for hashish fudge. Toklas, however, had no idea what the mysterious ingredient - cannabis - was, protesting later 'of course I didn't know the Latin name'.\" Cf. John Geiger, 'Brion Gysin: His Life and Times' in ''Brion Gysin: Tuning into the Multimedia Age'', p. 213.</ref>\n\n==Burroughs on the Gysin cut-up==\nIn a 1966 interview by Conrad Knickerbocker for [[The Paris Review]], William S. Burroughs explained that Brion Gysin was, to his knowledge, \"the first to create cut-ups\".\n\n<blockquote>\nINTERVIEWER: How did you become interested in the cut-up technique?\n\nBURROUGHS: A friend, Brion Gysin, an American poet and painter, who has lived in Europe for thirty years, was, as far as I know, the first to create cut-ups. His cut-up poem, ''Minutes to Go'', was broadcast by the BBC and later published in a pamphlet. I was in Paris in the summer of 1960; this was after the publication there of ''Naked Lunch''. I became interested in the possibilities of this technique, and I began experimenting myself. Of course, when you think of it, ''[[The Waste Land]]'' was the first great cut-up collage, and Tristan Tzara had done a bit along the same lines. [[Dos Passos]] used the same idea in 'The Camera Eye' sequences in ''[[U.S.A. trilogy|USA]]''. I felt I had been working toward the same goal; thus it was a major revelation to me when I actually saw it being done.<ref>Knickerbocker, Conrad, Burroughs, Williams S., 'The Paris Review Interview with William S. Burroughs' in ''A Williams Burroughs Reader'', ed. John Calder (London: Picador, 1982), p. 263.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Influence==\nAccording to Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9rez Kuri, author of ''Brion Gysin: Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'' (2003) and co-curator of a major retrospective of the artist's work at The Edmonton Art Gallery in 1998, Gysin's wide range of \"radical ideas would become a source of inspiration for artists of the [[Beat Generation]], as well as for their successors (among them [[David Bowie]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Haring]], and [[Laurie Anderson]])\".<ref>Kuri, ''Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'', coverflap.</ref>  Other artists include [[Genesis P-Orridge]], [[John Zorn]] (as displayed on the 2013's [[Dreamachines]] album) and [[Brian Jones]].\n\n==Selected bibliography==\nGysin is the subject of John Geiger's biography, ''Nothing Is True Everything Is Permitted: The Life of Brion Gysin'', and features in ''Chapel of Extreme Experience: A Short History of Stroboscopic Light and the Dream Machine'', also by Geiger.

Administering BCG to someone who already has a nonspecific immune response against mycobacteria does not augment the response already there.  BCG will therefore appear not to be efficacious, because that person already has a level of immunity and BCG is not adding to that immunity.  This effect is called masking, because the effect of BCG is masked by environmental mycobacteria.

A reactive tuberculin skin test is a contraindication to BCG.  Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, not because of the common misconception that tuberculin reactors \"are already immune\" and therefore do not need BCG.  People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people  who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.\n\nBCG is given as a single [[intradermal]] injection at the insertion of the [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]].  If BCG is accidentally given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, then a local abscess may form (a \"BCG-oma\") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with antibiotics immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. However, it is important to note an abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual bacilli are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.<ref>Nick Makwana and Andrew Riordan (2004), \"Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses?\", Birmingham Heartlands Hospital {{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216053220/http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |archivedate=2007-02-16 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristic raised scar BCG immunization leaves is often used as proof of prior immunization. This scar must be distinguished from that of [[smallpox vaccination]], which it may resemble.\n\n==Adverse effects==\nBCG immunization generally causes some pain and scarring at the site of injection.  The main adverse effects are [[keloid]]s&mdash;large, raised scars.  The insertion of deltoid is most frequently used because the local complication rate is smallest when that site is used. Nonetheless, the buttock is an alternative site of administration because it provides better cosmetic outcomes.\n\nBCG vaccine should be given intradermally. If given subcutaneously, it may induce local infection and spread to the regional lymph nodes, causing either suppurative and nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. Conservative management is usually adequate for nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. If suppuration occurs, it may need needle aspiration. For nonresolving suppuration, surgical excision may be required. Evidence for the treatment of these complications is scarce.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Treating BCG-induced disease in children|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 23440826|pages = CD008300|volume = 1|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008300.pub2|first = Carlos A.|last = Cuello-Garc\u00eda|first2 = Giordano|last2 = P\u00e9rez-Gaxiola|first3 = Carlos|last3 = Jim\u00e9nez Guti\u00e9rrez}}</ref>\n\nUncommonly, breast and gluteal abscesses can occur due to haematogenous and lymphangiomatous spread.

Sometimes the powder is sealed with vacuum in a glass ampoule. Such a glass ampoule has to be opened slowly to prevent the airflow from blowing out the powder. Then the powder has to be diluted with saline water before injecting.\n\n==History==\nThe history of BCG is tied to that of [[smallpox]].  [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] first recognized bovine tuberculosis in 1854 and transmitted it, and [[Robert Koch]] first distinguished ''Mycobacterium bovis'' from ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  Following the success of [[vaccination]] in preventing smallpox, established during the 18th century, scientists thought to find a corollary in tuberculosis by drawing a parallel between bovine tuberculosis and [[cowpox]]:  it was hypothesized that infection with bovine tuberculosis might protect against infection with human tuberculosis.  In the late 19th century, clinical trials using ''M. bovis'' were conducted in Italy with disastrous results, because ''M. bovis'' was found to be just as virulent as ''M. tuberculosis''.\n\n[[Albert Calmette]], a French physician and bacteriologist, and his assistant and later colleague, [[Camille Gu\u00e9rin]], a veterinarian, were working at the [[Institut Pasteur de Lille]] ([[Lille]], France) in 1908.  Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tuberculosis bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and changed the course of their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium.  The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals.  Calmette and Guerin transferred to the Paris [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1919.  The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Fine PE, Carneiro IA, Milstein JB, Clements CJ | title=Issues relating to the use of BCG in immunization programs | publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] | year=1999 | location=Geneva }}</ref>\n\nPublic acceptance was slow, and one disaster, in particular, did much to harm public acceptance of the vaccine. In the summer of 1930 in [[L\u00fcbeck]], 240 infants were vaccinated in the first 10 days of life; almost all developed tuberculosis and 72 infants died. It was subsequently discovered that the BCG administered there had been contaminated with a virulent strain that was being stored in the same incubator, which led to legal action against the manufacturers of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rosenthal SR. | title=BCG vaccination against tuberculosis | publisher=Little, Brown & Co. | location=Boston | year=1957 }}</ref>\n\n[[Dr. R.G. Ferguson]], working at the [[Fort San, Saskatchewan|Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium]] in Saskatchewan, was among the pioneers in developing the practice of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1928, BCG was adopted by the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] (predecessor to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]).  Because of opposition, however, it only became widely used after World War II.  From 1945 to 1948, relief organizations (International Tuberculosis Campaign or Joint Enterprises) vaccinated over 8 million babies in [[eastern Europe]] and prevented the predicted typical increase of TB after a major war.\n\nBCG is very efficacious against [[tuberculous meningitis]] in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis appears to be variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. Two countries that have never used it routinely are the United States and the Netherlands (in both countries, it is felt that having a reliable [[Mantoux test]] and therefore being able to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a condition that is now relatively rare there).<ref>{{cite web

of Europe and extends into Asia. Over much of its range, it is resident year-round, but birds from the colder parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] typically migrate south (some well into the Southern Hemisphere) for the northern winter.\n\n==Systematics==\nThe first [[Species description|formal description]] of the common buzzard was by the Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' under the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] ''Falco buteo''.<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> The genus ''Buteo'' was introduced by the French naturalist [[Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de]] in 1799 by [[tautonymy]] with the specific name of this species.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de | first=Bernard Germain de | authorlink=Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de | year=1799 | title=Discours d'ouverture et de cl\u00f4ture du cours d'histoire naturelle | chapter=Tableau des sous-classes, divisions, sous-division, ordres et genres des oiseux | language=French | publisher=Plassan | place=Paris | page=4 | chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6uhAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA78 }} Page numbering starts at one for each of the three sections.<!--BHL appears not to have a scan--></ref><ref>{{ cite book | editor1-last=Mayr | editor1-first=Ernst | editor1-link=Ernst Mayr | editor2-last=Cottrell | editor2-first=G.

In the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.\n\nThe steppe buzzard is some times split off as a separate species, ''B. vulpinus''. Compared to the nominate form, it is slightly smaller ({{convert|45|\u2013|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long), longer winged and longer tailed. The two colour morphs are the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name (''vulpes'' is Latin for \"fox\") and a dark grey form.\n\nThe tail of ''B. vulpinus'' is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling North American [[red-tailed hawk]]. The upper wings have pale primary patches, and the primary flight feathers are also paler when viewed from below. Adults have a black trailing edge to the wings, and both morphs often have plain underparts, lacking the breast band frequently seen in ''B. b. buteo''.\n\n==Behaviour==\n\nThe common buzzard breeds in [[woodland]]s, usually on the fringes, but favours hunting over open land. It eats mainly small [[mammal]]s, and will come to [[carrion]]. A great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, rabbit, other small mammals to medium mammals, snakes and lizards, and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} When available, common buzzards feed on their preferred prey species, field voles ''Microtus agrestis'', in relation to their abundance.  When the abundance of field voles decline, common buzzards switch to foraging on a diversity of prey items typical of farmland habitats.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Francksen, R.

The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writer on [[Dartmoor]], [[William Crossing]], noted he had on occasions seen flocks of 15 or more at some places.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Though a rare occurrence, as many as 20 buzzards can be spotted in one field area, approximately {{convert|30|m|ft}} apart, so cannot be classed as a flock in the general sense, consisting of birds without a mate or territory. They are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair's territory, but dominant displays of aggression will normally see off the interloper. Pairs mate for life. To attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of spring. This spectacular display is known as 'the roller coaster'. He will rise high up in the sky, to turn and plummet downward, in a spiral, twisting and turning as he comes down. He then rises immediately upward to repeat the exercise.\n\nThe call is a plaintive ''peea-ay'', similar to a cat's [[Cat communication#Meow|meow]].\n\n==Status==\nIn parts of its range it is increasing in numbers. In [[Ireland]] it became extinct about 1910, but began to slowly recolonise the country in the 1950s, and is now a common and familiar sight over much of Ireland.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nButeo buteo -Netherlands-8.jpg|in the Netherlands\nFile:Common (Steppe) Buzzard.jpg|B. b. vulpinus, note the pale tail - Lake Nakuru Nat'l Park - Kenya\nButeo buteo -Hamerton Zoo, Cambridgeshire, England -head-8a.jpg|At [[Hamerton Zoo]], England\nBuzzard UK09.JPG|In flight, Devon, England.

It is named after Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]]. As a synthetic element, it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. It is [[radioactive]]: its most stable known [[isotope]], <sup>270</sup>Bh, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 61&nbsp;seconds, though the unconfirmed <sup>278</sup>Bh may have a longer half-life of about 690&nbsp;seconds.\n\nIn the [[periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 7 element]]s as the fifth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[rhenium]] in group 7. The [[chemical properties]] of bohrium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 7 elements.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Niels Bohr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Element 107 was originally proposed to be named after [[Niels Bohr]], a Danish nuclear physicist, with the name ''nielsbohrium'' (Ns). This name was later changed by [[IUPAC]] to ''bohrium'' (Bh).]]\n\n===Discovery===\nTwo groups claimed [[Timeline of chemical element discoveries|discovery of the element]]. Evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a Russian research team led by [[Yuri Oganessian]], in which targets of [[bismuth-209]] and [[lead]]-208 were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of [[chromium]]-54 and [[manganese]]-55 respectively.<ref>Yu.

Since the ratio of the intensities of these two activities was constant throughout the experiment, it was proposed that the first was from the [[isotope]] bohrium-261 and that the second was from its daughter [[dubnium]]-257. Later, the dubnium isotope was corrected to dubnium-258, which indeed has a five-second half-life (dubnium-257 has a one-second half-life); however, the half-life observed for its parent is much shorter than the half-lives later observed in the definitive discovery of bohrium at [[Darmstadt]] in 1981. The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) concluded that while dubnium-258 was probably seen in this experiment, the evidence for the production of its parent bohrium-262 was not convincing enough.<ref name=\"93TWG\"/>\n\nIn 1981, a German research team led by [[Peter Armbruster]] and [[Gottfried M\u00fcnzenberg]] at the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] (GSI Helmholtzzentrum f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 to produce 5 atoms of the isotope bohrium-262:<ref name=\"262Bh\">{{cite journal\n|last1=M\u00fcnzenberg\n|first1=G.\n|last2=Hofmann\n|first2=S.\n|last3=He\u00dfberger\n|first3=F.

Fluorination results in MO<sub>3</sub>F and MO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub> for the heavier elements in addition to the rhenium compounds ReOF<sub>5</sub> and ReF<sub>7</sub>. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties.<ref>Hans Georg Nadler \"Rhenium and Rhenium Compounds\"  Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_199}}</ref> Since the oxychlorides are asymmetrical, and they should have increasingly large [[dipole]] moments going down the group, they should become less volatile in the order TcO<sub>3</sub>Cl &gt; ReO<sub>3</sub>Cl &gt; BhO<sub>3</sub>Cl: this was experimentally confirmed in 2000 by measuring the [[enthalpy|enthalpies]] of [[adsorption]] of these three compounds. The values are for TcO<sub>3</sub>Cl and ReO<sub>3</sub>Cl are \u221251&nbsp;kJ/mol and \u221261&nbsp;kJ/mol respectively; the experimental value for BhO<sub>3</sub>Cl is \u221277.8&nbsp;kJ/mol, very close to the theoretically expected value of \u221278.5&nbsp;kJ/mol.<ref name=Haire/>\n\n===Physical and atomic===\nBohrium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a [[hexagonal close-packed]] crystal structure (<sup>''c''</sup>/<sub>''a''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.62), similar to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] rhenium.<ref name=hcp/> It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 37.1&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only [[meitnerium]] (37.4&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and [[hassium]] (41&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of only 22.61&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.<ref name=Haire/>\n\nThe atomic radius of bohrium is expected to be around 128&nbsp;pm.<ref name=Haire/> Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Bh<sup>+</sup> ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of [Rn] 5f<sup>14</sup> 6d<sup>4</sup> 7s<sup>2</sup>, giving up a 6d electron instead of a 7s electron, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues manganese and technetium. Rhenium, on the other hand, follows its heavier congener bohrium in giving up a 5d electron before a 6s electron, as relativistic effects have become significant by the sixth period, where they cause among other things the yellow color of [[gold]] and the low melting point of [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. The Bh<sup>2+</sup> ion is expected to have an electron configuration of [Rn] 5f<sup>14</sup> 6d<sup>3</sup> 7s<sup>2</sup>; in contrast, the Re<sup>2+</sup> ion is expected to have a [Xe] 4f<sup>14</sup> 5d<sup>5</sup> configuration, this time analogous to manganese and technetium.<ref name=Haire/> The ionic radius of hexacoordinate heptavalent bohrium is expected to be 58&nbsp;pm (heptavalent manganese, technetium, and rhenium having values of 46, 57, and 53&nbsp;pm respectively). Pentavalent bohrium should have a larger ionic radius of 83&nbsp;pm.<ref name=Haire/>\n\n==Experimental chemistry==\nIn 1995, the first report on attempted isolation of the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (using its lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison) and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent [[actinide]]s, the [[group 5 element]]s, and [[polonium]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Chemical Separation Procedure Proposed for Studies of Bohrium|last1=Malmbeck|first1=R.|last2=Skarnemark|first2=G.|last3=Alstad|first3=J.|last4=Fure|first4=K.|last5=Johansson|first5=M.|last6=Omtvedt|first6=J.

Her older sister, Toni Bracher-Lawrence, was a member of the Houston City Council from 2004 to 2010. She graduated from [[Waltrip High School]]<ref>\"[http://hs.houstonisd.org/WaltripHS/TriviaFolder/trivia.htm Waltrip Trivia Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831194046/http://hs.houstonisd.org/WaltripHS/TriviaFolder/trivia.htm |date=2012-08-31 }},\" ''[[Waltrip High School]]''</ref> and earned a Bachelor of Arts from the [[University of St. Thomas (Houston)|University of Saint Thomas]] in Houston. She earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[Yeshiva University]] [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]].\n\n==Career==\nAs a newcomer, she achieved a surprising measure of success, working for [[HBO]] and Stacy Keach Productions.{{When|date=May 2012}} In the early 1990s, she worked as an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of [[Wilmer Cutler & Pickering]] where she did civil litigation for several years before becoming an [[Assistant U.S. Attorney]].\n\nOlson's support in 1991 of Supreme Court nominee [[Clarence Thomas]] led to the formation of the [[Independent Women's Forum]]. At that time, Olson and friend [[Rosalie (Ricky) Gaull Silberman]] started an informal network of women who supported the Thomas nomination to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment by [[Anita Hill]], a former subordinate of Thomas at the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]. Olson, who had also worked under Thomas at the EEOC and was a close friend of Thomas, spoke out on his behalf during his contentious Senate confirmation hearings. Olson later helped edit ''[[The Real Anita Hill]]'', a book by [[David Brock]] that savaged Hill and portrayed the harassment claim as a political dirty trick (Brock later recanted his claims and apologized to Hill). The Independent Women's Forum continued on with a goal of retaining a high profile group of women to advocate for economic and political freedom and personal responsibility.\n\nIn 1994, Olson became chief investigative counsel for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]. In that position, she led the [[Travelgate]] and [[Filegate]] investigations into the Clinton administration. She was later a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of the [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Alabama law firm [[Balch & Bingham]].\n\n==Personal life==\nShe married [[Theodore Olson]] in 1996, becoming his third wife.<ref name=napanuptials>{{cite news |title= Napa Nuptials for Olson and His Lady |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/22/AR2006102200052.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns |date= October 22, 2006 |accessdate= August 19, 2009 |work= [[The Washington Post]] |first1= Amy |last1= Argetsinger |first2= Roxanne |last2= Roberts |lastauthoramp= yes |authorlink1= Amy Argetsinger |authorlink2= Roxanne Roberts |department= The Reliable Source }}</ref> Theodore went on to successfully represent [[United States presidential election, 2000|presidential candidate]] [[George W.
