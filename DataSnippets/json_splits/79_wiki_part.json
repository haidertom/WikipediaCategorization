The contents of [[GNU]], current at the time of writing, are then described and detailed. [[Richard Stallman]] gives a fairly elaborate rationalization of the importance and benefits of seeing the project to fruition.  One of the major driving points behind the [[GNU]] project, according to Stallman, is the (at the time) rapid trend toward Unix and its various components becoming proprietary (ie. closed-source and non-libre) software.  Later on, the ''GNU Manifesto'' details how nearly everyone benefits from the project.  In essence, this is broken into two parts - the benefits to contributors and the benefits to consumers/community as a whole.  In other words, [[software developer]]s (contributors) may modify, enhance, correct, etc. the [[source code]] under these terms; thereby contributing to the overall stability and feature-set of the software. Additionally, developers may even use the GNU Licensed code in their own applications (provided an exact copy of the received GNU license is included with all distributions).  The second part of this section explains how it's not just the developers who will benefit, but also the end-users.  The general trend throughout is that, in the opinion of the authors, everyone benefits from the project's stated goals. A fairly large part of the ''GNU Manifesto'' is focused on rebutting possible objections to [[GNU | GNU Project's]] goals. Objections described here include the programmer's need to make a living, the issue of advertising/distributing [[free software]], and the perceived need of a [[profit motive|profit incentive]]. Most of this text explains how the [[free software philosophy]] works, and why it would be a good choice for the technology industry to follow.<ref name=\"GNU Manifesto\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free software}}\n* [[Free software]]\n* ''[[The Free Software Definition]]''\n* [[History of free and open-source software]]\n* [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html GNU Manifesto]\n\n{{GNU}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gnu Manifesto}}\n[[Category:GNU Project]]\n[[Category:Free software culture and documents]]\n[[Category:Free Software Foundation]]\n[[Category:Copyleft media]]\n[[Category:Internet culture]]\n[[Category:Political manifestos]]\n[[Category:1985 documents]]\n[[Category:Works about intellectual property law]]\n\n\n{{Activism-stub}}", "sha1": "6k9s3sovjx8mcif96fk5ulrjvbt1pez"}}, {"title": "Gross domestic product", "ns": "0", "id": "12594", "revision": {"id": "865813102", "parentid": "865813086", "timestamp": "2018-10-26T09:49:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "Citizen Canine", "id": "33426808"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/212.55.25.249|212.55.25.249]] ([[User talk:212.55.25.249|talk]]) to last version by ClueBot NG", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|GDP}}\n[[File:Countries by GDP (Nominal) in 2014.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|A map of world economies by size of GDP (nominal) in USD, ''[[World Bank]]<ref>https://www.mmwarburggruppe.com/export/download/mmwarburg.com/geschaeftsberichte/WEB_MMW_GB_2017_DE.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.hapag-lloyd.com/de/products/fleet/vessel.html</ref>'', 2014<ref name=\"CIA\">{{cite web|url=http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/GDP.pdf|title=GDP (Official  Exchange Rate)|publisher=[[World Bank]]|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}</ref>]]\n'''Gross Domestic Product '''('''GDP''') is a monetary [[Measurement in economics|measure]] of the market value of all the [[final good]]s and services produced in a period of [[time]], often annually or quarterly.

After the [[Bretton Woods conference]] in 1944, GDP became the main tool for measuring a country's economy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dickinson|first=Elizabeth|title=GDP: a brief history|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/02/gdp_a_brief_history|publisher=ForeignPolicy.com|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> At that time [[gross national product]] (GNP) was the preferred estimate, which differed from GDP in that it measured production by a country's citizens at home and abroad rather than its 'resident institutional units' (see [[OECD]] definition above).\nThe switch from \"GNP\" to \"GDP\" in the US was in 1991, trailing behind most other nations. The role that measurements of GDP played in World War II was crucial to the subsequent political acceptance of GDP values as indicators of national development and progress.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-power-of-a-single-number/9780231175104|title=The Power of a Single Number: A Political History of GDP|last=Lepenies|first=Philipp|date=April 2016|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231541435}}</ref> A crucial role was played here by the [[US Department of Commerce]] under Milton Gilbert where ideas from Kuznets were embedded into governmental institutions.\n\nThe history of the concept of GDP should be distinguished from the history of changes in ways of estimating it. The value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts, but the value added by the public sector, by financial industries, and by [[intangible asset]] creation is more complex. These activities are increasingly important in developed economies, and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in GDP regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances. In the words of one academic economist \"The actual number for GDP is therefore the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them to the conceptual framework.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History|last = Coyle|first = Diane|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9780691156798|location = |pages = 6}}</ref>\n\n==Determining gross domestic product (GDP)==\n{{Economics sidebar}}\n\nGDP can be determined in three ways, all which should, in principle, give the same result. They are the production (or output or value added) approach, the income approach, or the speculated expenditure approach.\n\nThe most direct of the three is the production approach, which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total. The expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the product must be bought by somebody, therefore the value of the total product must be equal to people's total expenditures in buying things. The income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors (\"producers,\" colloquially) must be equal to the value of their product, and determines GDP by finding the sum of all producers' incomes.<ref>World Bank, Statistical Manual >> National Accounts >> [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/EXTDECSTAMAN/0,,contentMDK:20882526~menuPK:2648252~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2077967~isCURL:Y,00.html GDP\u2013final output] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416073205/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/EXTDECSTAMAN/0,,contentMDK:20882526~menuPK:2648252~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2077967~isCURL:Y,00.html |date=2010-04-16 }}, retrieved October 2009.<br />\n{{cite web | title=User's guide: Background information on GDP and GDP deflator | publisher=HM Treasury | url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/data_gdp_backgd.htm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302084957/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/data_gdp_backgd.htm | archivedate=2009-03-02 | df= }}<br />{{cite web | title=Measuring the Economy: A Primer on GDP and the National Income and Product Accounts | publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis | url=https://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipa_primer.pdf | format=PDF }}</ref>\n\n===Production approach===\nThis approach mirrors the [[OECD]] definition given above.\n\n# Estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the many various economic activities;\n# Determine the [intermediate consumption], i.e., the cost of material, supplies and services used to produce final goods or services.\n# Deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to obtain the gross value added.\n\n[[Gross value added]] = gross value of output \u2013 value of intermediate consumption.\n\nValue of output = value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventory.\n\nThe sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as \"GDP at factor cost\".\n\nGDP at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products = \"GDP at producer price\".\n\nFor measuring output of domestic product, economic activities (i.e. industries) are classified into various sectors. After classifying economic activities, the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods:\n# By multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them together\n# By collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding them together\n\nThe gross value of all sectors is then added to get the gross value added (GVA) at factor cost. Subtracting each sector's intermediate consumption from gross output gives the GVA at factor cost. Adding indirect tax minus subsidies in GVA at factor cost gives the \"GVA at producer prices\".\n\n===Income approach===\n\nThe second way of estimating GDP is to use \"the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIf GDP is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income (GDI), or GDP (I). GDI should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later. By definition, GDI is equal to GDP. In practice, however, measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies.\n\nThis method measures GDP by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire - wages for labour, interest for capital, rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship.\n\nThe US \"National Income and Expenditure Accounts\" divide incomes into five categories:\n# Wages, salaries, and supplementary labour income\n# Corporate profits\n# Interest and miscellaneous investment income\n# Farmers' incomes\n# Income from non-farm unincorporated businesses\nThese five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost.\n\nTwo adjustments must be made to get GDP:\n# Indirect taxes minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices.\n# Depreciation (or [[capital consumption allowance]]) is added to get from net domestic product to gross domestic product.\n\nTotal income can be subdivided according to various schemes, leading to various formulae for GDP measured by the income approach. A common one is:\n\n: ''GDP = [[compensation of employees]] + [[gross operating surplus]] + [[gross mixed income]] + taxes less subsidies on production and imports''\n: '''GDP''' = '''COE''' + '''GOS''' + '''GMI''' + '''T<sub>P & M</sub>''' \u2013 '''S<sub>P & M</sub>'''\n* '''Compensation of employees''' (COE) measures the total remuneration to employees for work done. It includes wages and salaries, as well as employer contributions to [[social security]] and other such programs.\n* '''Gross operating surplus''' (GOS) is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses. Often called [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from [[gross output]] to calculate GOS.\n* '''Gross mixed income''' (GMI) is the same measure as GOS, but for unincorporated businesses. This often includes most small businesses.\n\nThe sum of '''COE''', '''GOS''' and '''GMI''' is called total factor income; it is the income of all of the factors of production in society. It measures the value of GDP at factor (basic) prices. The difference between basic prices and final prices (those used in the expenditure calculation) is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production. So adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts GDP at [[factor cost]] to GDP(I).\n\nTotal factor income is also sometimes expressed as:\n:''Total factor income = employee compensation + corporate profits + proprietor's income + rental income + net interest''<ref>United States Bureau of Economic Analysis, {{cite web|url= https://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipaguid.pdf |title=''A guide to the National Income and Product Accounts of the United States'' }}, page 5; retrieved November 2009. Another term, \"business current transfer payments\", may be added. Also, the document indicates that the capital consumption adjustment (CCAdj) and the inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) are applied to the proprietor's income and corporate profits terms; and CCAdj is applied to rental income.</ref>\n\n===Expenditure approach===\nThe third way to estimate GDP is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured in purchasers' prices.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMarket goods which are produced are purchased by someone. In the case where a good is produced and unsold, the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves. Therefore, measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production. This is known as the expenditure method of calculating GDP.\n\n====Components of GDP by expenditure====\n[[File:GDP Categories - United States.png|thumb|upright=1.05|U.S. GDP computed on the expenditure basis.]]\n\n'''GDP (Y)''' is the sum of '''consumption (C)''', '''investment (I)''', '''government spending (G)''' and '''net exports (X \u2013 M)'''.\n:'''Y''' = '''C''' + '''I''' + '''G''' + '''(X \u2212 M)'''\n\nHere is a description of each GDP component:\n* '''C (consumption)''' is normally the largest GDP component in the economy, consisting of private expenditures in the economy ([[household final consumption expenditure]]). These personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories: [[durable good]]s, nondurable goods, and services. Examples include food, rent, jewelry, gasoline, and medical expenses, but not the purchase of new housing.\n* '''I (investment)''' includes, for instance, business investment in equipment, but does not include exchanges of existing assets. Examples include construction of a new [[mining|mine]], purchase of software, or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory. Spending by households (not government) on new houses is also included in investment. In contrast to its colloquial meaning, \"investment\" in GDP does not mean purchases of [[financial market|financial products]]. Buying financial products is classed as '[[saving]]', as opposed to investment. This avoids double-counting: if one buys shares in a company, and the company uses the money received to buy plant, equipment, etc., the amount will be counted toward GDP when the company spends the money on those things; to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products. Buying [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] or [[stock]]s is a swapping of [[deed]]s, a transfer of claims on future production, not directly an expenditure on products.\n* '''G (government spending)''' is the sum of [[government spending|government expenditures]] on [[final good]]s and services. It includes salaries of [[public servants]], purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government. It does not include any [[transfer payment]]s, such as [[social security]] or [[unemployment benefits]].\n* '''X (exports)''' represents gross exports. GDP captures the amount a country produces, including goods and services produced for other nations' consumption, therefore exports are added.\n* '''M (imports)''' represents gross imports. Imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms '''G''', '''I''', or '''C''', and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign [[Supply and demand|supply]] as domestic.\n\nNote that '''C''', '''G''', and '''I''' are expenditures on [[final good]]s and services; expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count. (Intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year.<ref>Thayer Watkins, San Jos\u00e9 State University Department of Economics, [http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/gdp.htm \"Gross Domestic Product from the Transactions Table for an Economy\"], commentary to first table, \" Transactions Table for an Economy\". (Page retrieved November 2009.)</ref>)\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the United States, \"In general, the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components [see income method, below].\"<ref>''Concepts and Methods of the United States National Income and Product Accounts'', chap. 2.</ref>\n\n==GDP vs GNI==\nGDP can be contrasted with [[gross national product]] (GNP) or, as it is now known, [[Gross National Income|gross national income]] (GNI). The difference is that GDP defines its scope according to location, while GNI defines its scope according to ownership. In a global context, [[Gross world product|world GDP and world GNI]] are, therefore, equivalent terms.\n\nGDP is product produced within a country's borders; GNI is product produced by enterprises owned by a country's citizens. The two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens, and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries. In practice, however, foreign ownership makes GDP and GNI non-identical. Production within a country's borders, but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country, counts as part of its GDP but not its GNI; on the other hand, production by an enterprise located outside the country, but owned by one of its citizens, counts as part of its GNI but not its GDP.\n\nFor example, the GNI of the USA is the value of output produced by American-owned firms, regardless of where the firms are located. Similarly, if a country becomes increasingly in debt, and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased GNI but not a decreased GDP. Similarly, if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased GNI, but not decreased GDP. This would make the use of GDP more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets.\n\nGross national income (GNI) equals GDP plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite book |first=Fran\u00e7ois |last=Lequiller |author2=Derek Blades |title=Understanding National Accounts |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pXpJL6f8b3wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Understanding+National+Accounts%22#v=onepage&q=%22To%20convert%20GDP%20into%20GNI%22&f=false |publisher=OECD |year=2006 |page=18|isbn=978-92-64-02566-0 |quote=To convert GDP into GNI, it is necessary to add the income received by resident units from abroad and deduct the income created by production in the country but transferred to units residing abroad.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, the United States switched from using GNP to using GDP as its primary measure of production.<ref>United States, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Glossary, [https://www.bea.gov/glossary/glossary.cfm \"GDP\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129140050/https://www.bea.gov/glossary/glossary.cfm |date=2018-01-29 }}.

To make it more meaningful for year-to-year comparisons, it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the GDP was measured and the value of money in a base year.\n\nFor example, suppose a country's GDP in 1990 was $100 million and its GDP in 2000 was $300 million. Suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period. To meaningfully compare its GDP in 2000 to its GDP in 1990, we could multiply the GDP in 2000 by one-half, to make it relative to 1990 as a base year. The result would be that the GDP in 2000 equals $300 million \u00d7 one-half = $150 million, ''in 1990 monetary terms.'' We would see that the country's GDP had realistically increased 50 [[Percentage#Percentage increase and decrease|percent]] over that period, not 200 percent, as it might appear from the raw GDP data. The GDP adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the [[real gross domestic product|real, or constant, GDP]].\n\nThe factor used to convert GDP from current to constant values in this way is called the ''[[GDP deflator]]''. Unlike [[consumer price index]], which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods, the GDP deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services, as well as household consumption goods.<ref>HM Treasury, ''Background information on GDP and GDP deflator''<br />\nSome of the complications involved in comparing national accounts from different years are explained in this World Bank [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/EXTDECSTAMAN/0,,contentMDK:20908551~menuPK:2648276~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2077967~isCURL:Y,00.html document] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616033552/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/EXTDECSTAMAN/0,,contentMDK:20908551~menuPK:2648276~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2077967~isCURL:Y,00.html |date=2010-06-16 }}.\n</ref>\n\nConstant-GDP figures allow us to calculate a GDP growth rate, which indicates how much a country's production has increased (or decreased, if the growth rate is negative) compared to the previous year.\n:Real GDP growth rate for year ''n'' = [(Real GDP in year ''n'') \u2212 (Real GDP in year ''n'' \u2212 1)] / (Real GDP in year ''n'' \u2212 1)\n\nAnother thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth. If a country's GDP doubled over a certain period, but its population tripled, the increase in GDP may not mean that the standard of living increased for the country's residents; the average person in the country is producing less than they were before. ''Per-capita GDP'' is a measure to account for population growth.\n\n==Cross-border comparison and purchasing power parity==\nThe level of GDP in countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to ''either'' the current currency exchange rate, or the purchasing power parity exchange rate.\n* '''Current currency exchange rate''' is the [[exchange rate]] in the international [[foreign exchange market]].\n* '''Purchasing power parity exchange rate''' is the exchange rate based on the [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) of a currency relative to a selected standard (usually the [[United States dollar]]). This is a comparative (and theoretical) exchange rate, the only way to directly realize this rate is to sell an entire [[CPI]] basket in one country, convert the cash at the currency market rate & then rebuy that same basket of goods in the other country (with the converted cash). Going from country to country, the distribution of prices within the basket will vary; typically, non-tradable purchases will consume a greater proportion of the basket's total cost in the higher GDP country, per the [[Balassa-Samuelson effect]].\n\nThe ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used.\n* The ''current exchange rate method'' converts the value of goods and services using global currency [[exchange rate]]s. The method can offer better indications of a country's international purchasing power. For instance, if 10% of GDP is being spent on buying hi-tech foreign [[weapon|arms]], the number of weapons purchased is entirely governed by ''current exchange rates'', since arms are a traded product bought on the international market. There is no meaningful 'local' price distinct from the international price for high technology goods. The PPP method of GDP conversion is more relevant to non-traded goods and services. In the above example if hi-tech weapons are to be produced internally their amount will be governed by GDP (PPP) rather than nominal GDP.\n\nThere is a clear pattern of the ''purchasing power parity method'' decreasing the disparity in GDP between high and low income (GDP) countries, as compared to the ''current exchange rate method''. This finding is called the [[Penn effect]].\n\nFor more information, see [[Measures of national income and output]].\n\n==Standard of living and GDP: Wealth distribution and externalities==\nGDP per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards.<ref name=HDWMSL>{{cite web|title=How Do We Measure Standard of Living?|url=https://www.bostonfed.org/education/ledger/ledger03/winter/measure.pdf|website=The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston}}</ref>\n\nThe major advantage of GDP per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently, widely, and consistently. It is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on GDP on a quarterly basis, allowing trends to be seen quickly. It is measured widely in that some measure of GDP is available for almost every country in the world, allowing inter-country comparisons. It is measured consistently in that the technical definition of GDP is relatively consistent among countries.\n\nGDP does not include several factors that influence the standard of living. In particular, it fails to account for:\n* '''[[Externalities]]''' \u2013 Economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are not directly measured in GDP.<ref name=\"soL\">{{cite book |last1=Mankiw |first1=N.

For example, in countries with major business transactions occurring informally, portions of local economy are not easily registered. [[barter (economics)|Bartering]] may be more prominent than the use of money, even extending to services.<ref name=\"limitations\" />\n* '''Quality improvements and inclusion of new products'''\u2013 by not fully adjusting for quality improvements and new products, GDP understates true [[economic growth]]. For instance, although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the past, GDP treats them as the same products by only accounting for the monetary value. The introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in GDP despite the fact that it may increase the standard of living. For example, even the richest person in 1900 could not purchase standard products, such as antibiotics and cell phones, that an average consumer can buy today, since such modern conveniences did not exist then.\n* '''Sustainability of growth'''\u2013 GDP is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection.\n* '''[[Wealth distribution]]'''  \u2013 GDP does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups.

With quantitative measurements especially, the definiteness of the result suggests, often misleadingly, a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured. Measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse, especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification.  [...]</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>All these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare. But in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values. Economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known. And no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income, that is, the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income. The welfare of a nation can, therefore, scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above.</blockquote> In 1962, Kuznets stated:<ref>Simon Kuznets. \"How To Judge Quality\". The New Republic, October 20, 1962</ref><blockquote>Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns, and between the short and long run. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what.</blockquote>\n\n=== Further criticisms ===\nEver since the development of GDP, multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using GDP as the overarching measure of economic and social progress.\n\nMany [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] argue that GDP is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the [[biosphere|environment]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeroen |last=van den Bergh |date=April 13, 2010 |title=The Virtues of Ignoring GDP |work=The Broker |url=http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/Articles/The-virtues-of-ignoring-GDP }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Gertner |date=May 13, 2010 |work=[[New York Times Magazine]] |title=The Rise and Fall of G.D.P. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/magazine/16GDP-t.html?pagewanted=all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough a high or rising level of GDP is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country, a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances. For example, [[Jean Dr\u00e8ze]] and [[Amartya Sen]] have pointed out that an increase in GDP or in GDP growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living, particularly in areas such as healthcare and education.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Uncertain Glory: India and its Contradictions|last2=Sen|first2=Amartya|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400848775|location=Princeton|last1=Dr\u00e8ze|first1=Jean}}</ref> Another important area that does not necessarily improve along with GDP is political liberty, which is most notable in China, where GDP growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2012/china-0|title=China Country Report Freedom in the World 2012|website=freedomhouse.org}}</ref>\n\nGDP does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country, because GDP is merely an aggregate measure. An economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly, but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society. These inequalities often occur on the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other minority status within countries. This can lead to misleading characterizations of economic well-being if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end, as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country. Even GDP per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high. For example, South Africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of GDP per capita, but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the country.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nGDP does not take into account the value of household and other [[unpaid work]]. Some, including [[Martha Nussbaum]], argue that this value should be included in measuring GDP, as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value.<ref>{{cite book|title=Creating capabilities : the human development approach|date=2013|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=0674072359|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.}}</ref> Even under conservative estimates, the value of unpaid labor in Australia has been calculated to be over 50% of the country's GDP.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding national accounts|date=2006|publisher=OECD|isbn=978-92-64-02566-0|edition=Reprint.|location=Paris|page=112|last1=Blades|first1=Fran\u00e7ois Lequiller, Derek}}</ref> A later study analyzed this value in other countries, with results ranging from a low of about 15% in Canada (using conservative estimates) to high of nearly 70% in the United Kingdom (using more liberal estimates).

As a result, an economy can run down its assets yet, at the same time, record high levels of GDP growth, until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth\". They then went on to say that \"it is apparent that the recorded GDP growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate.  Broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that short-term decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the long-term\".\n\nIt has been suggested that countries that have authoritarian governments, such as the People's Republic of China, and Russia, inflate their GDP figures.<ref>{{cite news |agency=Washington Post |last=Ingraham |first=Christopher |date=15 May 2018 |title=Satellite data strongly suggests that China, Russia and other authoritarian countries are fudging their GDP reports |url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Satellite-data-strongly-suggests-that-China-12916204.php#item-85307-tbla-5 |work=SFGate |location=San Francisco |access-date=16 May 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== Proposals to overcome GDP limitations ===\nIn response to these and other limitations of using GDP, alternative approaches have emerged.\n* In the 1980s, [[Amartya Sen]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]] developed the [[capability approach]], which focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country, rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country.

When he entered the Latin School two years later, he already knew the [[first declension]], having been taught it by his mother.

Authors he read include the poet [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] and writers associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[Christian Garve]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]].

Schelling and H\u00f6lderlin immersed themselves in theoretical debates on [[Kantian philosophy]], from which Hegel remained aloof. Hegel at this time envisaged his future as that of a ''Popularphilosoph'', i.e. a \"man of letters\" who serves to make the abstruse ideas of philosophers accessible to a wider public; his own felt need to engage critically with the central ideas of Kantianism did not come until 1800.\n\n==== Bern (1793\u20131796) and Frankfurt (1797\u20131801) ====\nHaving received his theological certificate (''[[consistory (Protestantism)|Konsistorial]]examen'') from the T\u00fcbingen Seminary, Hegel became ''Hofmeister'' (house tutor) to an aristocratic family in [[Bern]] (1793\u20131796). During this period, he composed the text which has become known as the ''[[Life of Jesus (Hegel)|Life of Jesus]]'' and a book-length manuscript titled \"The Positivity of the Christian Religion\".

Hegel accepted an offer mediated by H\u00f6lderlin to take up a similar position with a wine merchant's family in [[Frankfurt]], where he moved in 1797.

In 1802, Schelling and Hegel founded a journal, the ''Kritische Journal der Philosophie'' (''Critical Journal of Philosophy''), to which they each contributed pieces until the collaboration was ended when Schelling left for [[W\u00fcrzburg]] in 1803.\n\nIn 1805, the University promoted Hegel to the position of Extraordinary Professor (unsalaried) after he wrote a letter to the poet and minister of culture [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] protesting at the promotion of his philosophical adversary [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]] ahead of him.<ref name=pinkard>{{cite book|last=Pinkard|first=Terry|title=Hegel: A Biography|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-49679-9}}</ref>{{rp|223}} Hegel attempted to enlist the help of the poet and translator [[Johann Heinrich Vo\u00df]] to obtain a post at the newly renascent [[University of Heidelberg]], but he failed; to his chagrin, Fries was later in the same year made Ordinary Professor (salaried) there.<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|224\u201325}}\n\n[[File:Hegel-and-Napoleon-in-Jena-1806.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|\"Hegel and Napoleon in Jena\" (illustration from ''Harper's Magazine'', 1895), whose meeting became proverbial due to Hegel's notable use of ''[[Weltseele]]'' (\"world-soul\") in reference to Napoleon (\"the world-soul on horseback\", ''{{lang|de|die Weltseele zu Pferde}}'')<ref>Note that ''Weltseele zu Pferde'' is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in the letter.

Hegel was putting the finishing touches to this book, ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on 14 October 1806 in the [[Battle of Jena]] on a plateau outside the city. On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena. Hegel recounted his impressions in a letter to his friend [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]]: <blockquote>I saw the Emperor \u2013 this world-soul [''[[Weltseele]]''] \u2013 riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.<ref>''{{lang|de|den Kaiser \u2013 diese Weltseele \u2013 sah ich durch die Stadt zum Rekognoszieren hinausreiten; es ist in der Tat eine wunderbare Empfindung, ein solches Individuum zu sehen, das hier auf einen Punkt kontentriert, auf einem Pferde sitzend, \u00fcber die Welt \u00fcbergreift und sie beherrscht.}}''Hegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F.

Pinkard (2000:228).</ref></blockquote>\n\nPinkard (2000) notes that Hegel's comment to Niethammer \"is all the more striking since at that point he had already composed the crucial section of the ''Phenomenology'' in which he remarked that the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] had now officially passed to another land (Germany) that would complete 'in thought' what the Revolution had only partially accomplished in practice\".<ref>Pinkard (2000:228f).</ref> Although Napoleon chose not to close down Jena as he had other universities, the city was devastated and students deserted the university in droves, making Hegel's financial prospects even worse. The following February, Hegel's landlady Christiana Burkhardt (who had been abandoned by her husband) gave birth to their son Georg Ludwig Friedrich Fischer (1807\u20131831).<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|192}}\n\nIn March 1807, Hegel moved to [[Bamberg]], where Niethammer had declined and passed on to Hegel an offer to become editor of a newspaper, the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Bamberger Zeitung|de}}''. Unable to find more suitable employment, Hegel reluctantly accepted. Ludwig Fischer and his mother (whom Hegel may have offered to marry following the death of her husband) stayed behind in Jena.<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|238}}\n\nIn November 1808, Hegel was again through Niethammer, appointed headmaster of a ''Gymnasium'' in [[Nuremberg]], a post he held until 1816. While in Nuremberg, Hegel adapted his recently published ''Phenomenology of Spirit'' for use in the classroom. Part of his remit being to teach a class called \"Introduction to Knowledge of the Universal Coherence of the Sciences\", Hegel developed the idea of an encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences, falling into three parts (logic, philosophy of nature and philosophy of spirit).<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|337}}\n\nIn 1811, Hegel married Marie Helena Susanna von Tucher (1791\u20131855), the eldest daughter of a Senator. This period saw the publication of his second major work, the ''Science of Logic'' (''Wissenschaft der Logik''; 3 vols., 1812, 1813 and 1816), and the birth of his two legitimate sons, [[Karl von Hegel|Karl Friedrich Wilhelm]] (1813\u20131901) and Immanuel Thomas Christian (1814\u20131891).\n\n==== Heidelberg and Berlin (1816\u20131831) ====\nHaving received offers of a post from the Universities of [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]], Hegel chose Heidelberg, where he moved in 1816. Soon after, his illegitimate son Ludwig Fischer (now ten years old) joined the Hegel household in April 1817, having thus far spent his childhood in an orphanage<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|354\u201355}} as his mother had died in the meantime.<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|356}}\n\nHegel published ''The Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Outline'' (1817) as a summary of his philosophy for students attending his lectures at Heidelberg.\n\n[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|Hegel with his Berlin students<br>Sketch by Franz Kugler]]\nIn 1818, Hegel accepted the renewed offer of the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin, which had remained vacant since [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s death in 1814. Here, Hegel published his ''Philosophy of Right'' (1821). Hegel devoted himself primarily to delivering his lectures; and his lecture courses on aesthetics, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of history and the history of philosophy were published posthumously from lecture notes taken by his students. His fame spread and his lectures attracted students from all over Germany and beyond.\n\nIn 1819\u20131827, he made several trips to [[Weimar]] (twice), where he met Goethe, [[Brussels]], the [[Northern Netherlands]], [[Leipzig]], [[Vienna]] through [[Prague]] and [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Siep xxii\">Ludwig Siep, ''Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit'', Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. xxi.</ref>\n\nHegel was appointed [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the University in October 1829, but his term as Rector ended in September 1830. Hegel was deeply disturbed by the riots for reform in Berlin in that year. In 1831, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decorated him with the [[Order of the Red Eagle]], 3rd Class for his service to the Prussian state.<ref name=\"Siep xxii\"/> In August 1831, a [[cholera]] epidemic reached Berlin and Hegel left the city, taking up lodgings in [[Kreuzberg]]. Now in a weak state of health, Hegel seldom went out. As the new semester began in October, Hegel returned to Berlin with the (mistaken) impression that the epidemic had largely subsided. By November 14, Hegel was dead. The physicians pronounced the cause of death as cholera, but it is likely he died from a different gastrointestinal disease. He is said to have uttered the last words \"And he didn't understand me\" before expiring.<ref>Norman Davies, ''[[Europe: A History]]'', 1996, p. 687.</ref> In accordance with his wishes, Hegel was buried on November 16 in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]] next to Fichte and [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand Solger]].\n\nHegel's son Ludwig Fischer had died shortly before while serving with the Dutch army in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] and the news of his death never reached his father.<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|548}} Early the following year, Hegel's sister Christiane committed suicide by drowning. Hegel's remaining two sons\u2014[[Karl von Hegel|Karl]], who became a historian; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Immanuel Hegel|de|3=Immanuel Hegel|lt=Immanuel}}, who followed a theological path\u2014lived long and safeguarded their father's ''[[Nachla\u00df]]'' and produced editions of his works.\n\n== Philosophical work ==\n{{Hegelianism}}\n\n=== Freedom ===\nHegel's thinking can be understood as a constructive development within the broad tradition that includes [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. To this list, one could add [[Proclus]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Plotinus]], [[Jakob B\u00f6hme]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. What all these thinkers share, which distinguishes them from [[materialists]] like [[Epicurus]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] and from [[empiricists]] like [[David Hume]], is that they regard freedom or self-determination both as real and as having important [[ontology|ontological]] implications for soul or mind or divinity. This focus on freedom is what generates Plato's notion (in the ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'') of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as having a higher or fuller kind of reality than inanimate objects possess. While [[Aristotle]] criticizes Plato's \"Forms\", he preserves Plato's cornerstones of the ontological implications for self-determination: ethical reasoning, the soul's pinnacle in the hierarchy of nature, the order of the cosmos and an assumption with reasoned arguments for a prime mover. Kant imports Plato's high esteem of individual sovereignty to his considerations of moral and noumenal freedom as well as to God. All three find common ground on the unique position of humans in the scheme of things, known by the discussed categorical differences from animals and inanimate objects.\n\nIn his discussion of \"Spirit\" in his ''Encyclopedia'', Hegel praises Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]]'' as \"by far the most admirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this topic\".<ref>par. 378</ref> In his ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' and his ''[[Science of Logic]]'', Hegel's concern with Kantian topics such as freedom and morality and with their ontological implications is pervasive. Rather than simply rejecting Kant's dualism of freedom versus nature, Hegel aims to subsume it within \"true infinity\", the \"Concept\" (or \"Notion\": ''Begriff''), \"Spirit\" and \"ethical life\" in such a way that the Kantian duality is rendered intelligible, rather than remaining a brute \"given\".\n\nThe reason why this subsumption takes place in a series of concepts is that Hegel's method in his ''Science of Logic'' and his ''Encyclopedia'' is to begin with basic concepts like \"Being\" and \"Nothing\" and to develop these through a long sequence of elaborations, including those already mentioned. In this manner, a solution that is reached in principle in the account of \"true infinity\" in the ''Science of Logic'''s chapter on \"Quality\" is repeated in new guises at later stages, all the way to \"Spirit\" and \"ethical life\" in the third volume of the ''Encyclopedia''.\n\nIn this way, Hegel intends to defend the germ of truth in Kantian dualism against reductive or eliminative programs like those of materialism and empiricism. Like Plato, with his dualism of soul versus bodily appetites, Kant pursues the mind's ability to question its felt inclinations or appetites and to come up with a standard of \"duty\" (or, in Plato's case, \"good\") which transcends bodily restrictiveness. Hegel preserves this essential Platonic and Kantian concern in the form of infinity going beyond the finite (a process that Hegel in fact relates to \"freedom\" and the \"ought\"),<ref name=miller>See ''Science of Logic'', trans. Miller [Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities, 1989]</ref>{{rp|133\u2013136, 138}} the universal going beyond the particular (in the Concept) and Spirit going beyond Nature. Hegel renders these dualities intelligible by (ultimately) his argument in the \"Quality\" chapter of the \"Science of Logic\". The finite has to become infinite in order to achieve reality. The idea of the absolute excludes multiplicity so the subjective and objective must achieve synthesis to become whole. This is because as Hegel suggests by his introduction of the concept of \"reality\",<ref name=miller/>{{rp|111}} what determines itself\u2014rather than depending on its relations to other things for its essential character\u2014is more fully \"real\" (following the Latin etymology of \"real\", more \"thing-like\") than what does not. Finite things do not determine themselves because as \"finite\" things their essential character is determined by their boundaries over against other finite things, so in order to become \"real\" they must go beyond their finitude (\"finitude is only as a transcending of itself\").<ref name=miller/>{{rp|145}}\n\nThe result of this argument is that finite and infinite\u2014and by extension, particular and universal, nature and freedom\u2014do not face one another as two independent realities, but instead the latter (in each case) is the self-transcending of the former.<ref name=miller/>{{rp|146}} Rather than stress the distinct singularity of each factor that complements and conflicts with others\u2014without explanation\u2014the relationship between finite and infinite (and particular and universal and nature and freedom) becomes intelligible as a progressively developing and self-perfecting whole.\n\n=== Progress ===\nThe mystical writings of [[Jakob B\u00f6hme]] had a strong effect on Hegel.<ref>[[Jon Mills (psychologist)|Jon Mills]], ''The Unconscious Abyss: Hegel's Anticipation of Psychoanalysis'', SUNY Press, 2002, p. 16.</ref> B\u00f6hme had written that the [[Fall of Man]] was a necessary stage in the [[evolution]] of the [[universe]]. This evolution was itself the result of God's desire for complete self-awareness. Hegel was fascinated by the works of Kant, Rousseau and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and by the [[French Revolution]]. Modern philosophy, culture and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, [[Philosophy of self|self]] and [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. Hegel's main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that in different contexts he called \"the absolute Idea\" (''[[Science of Logic]]'', sections 1781\u20131783) or \"absolute knowledge\" (''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', \"(DD) Absolute Knowledge\").\n\nAccording to Hegel, the main characteristic of this unity was that it evolved through and manifested itself in [[contradiction]] and negation. Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of [[reality]]\u2014[[consciousness]], history, philosophy, art, nature and society\u2014leads to further development until a [[rationality|rational]] unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts by lifting them up (''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'') to a higher unity. This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension. It is rational because the same, underlying, [[logic]]al, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious [[wikt:whole|whole]] is not a thing or [[being]] that lies outside of other existing things or minds. Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who through their own understanding bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself. Hegel's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a philosophy of absolute negation\u2014as long as absolute negation is at the center, systematization remains open, and makes it possible for human beings to become subjects.<ref name=\"Schroeder2000\">{{cite book|author=Steven Schroeder|title=Between Freedom and Necessity: An Essay on the Place of Value|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfT6aQvkVfAC&pg=PA104|accessdate=2012-12-17|year=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1302-5|page=104}}</ref>\n\n\"Mind\" and \"Spirit\" are the common English translations of Hegel's use of the German \"[[Geist]]\". Some{{Who|date=December 2012}} have argued that either of these terms overly \"psychologize\" Hegel,{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} implying a kind of disembodied, solipsistic consciousness like [[ghost]] or \"soul\". Geist combines the meaning of spirit\u2014as in god, ghost, or mind\u2014with an intentional force. In Hegel's early philosophy of nature (draft manuscripts written during his time at the University of Jena), Hegel's notion of \"Geist\" was tightly bound to the notion of \"[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]]\", from which Hegel also derived the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]], but in his later works (after Jena) he did not explicitly use his old notion of \"Aether\" anymore.<ref>Stefan Gruner: \"Hegel's Aether Doctrine\", [[VDM Publishing|VDM Publ]]., 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-639-28451-5}}</ref>\n\nCentral to Hegel's [[Conception (idea)|conception]] of [[knowledge]] and mind (and therefore also of reality) was the notion of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] in [[Subtraction|difference]]\u2014that is, that mind [[Externalization|externalizes]] itself in various forms and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that stand outside of it or opposed to it; and that through recognizing itself in them, is \"with itself\" in these external manifestations so that they are at one and the same time mind and other-than-mind. This notion of identity in difference, which is intimately bound up with his conception of contradiction and negativity, is a principal feature differentiating Hegel's thought from that of other philosophers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n=== Civil society ===\n{{see also|Civil society}}\nHegel made the distinction between civil society and state in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm|title=Hegel's Philosophy of Right: Preface|first=|last=Hegel, G.

This liberal distinction between [[political society]] and [[civil society]] was followed by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].<ref name=\"glob\" /> In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear. For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of \"lesser\" and not fully realized types of civil society as these societies were not fully conscious or aware\u2014as it were\u2014as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror such as Napoleon to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized.\n\n=== State ===\nHegel's State is the final culmination of the embodiment of freedom or right (''rechte'') in the ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]].'' The State subsumes family and civil society and fulfills them. All three together are called \"ethical life\" (''[[Sittlichkeit]]''). The State involves three \"[[wikt:moment#Noun|moments]]\". In a Hegelian State, citizens both know their place and choose their place. They both know their obligations and choose to fulfill their obligations. An individual's \"supreme duty is to be a member of the state\" (''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', section 258). The individual has \"substantial freedom in the state\". The State is \"objective spirit\" so \"it is only through being a member of the state that the individual himself has objectivity, truth, and ethical life\" (section 258). Furthermore, every member both loves the State with genuine patriotism, but has transcended mere \"team spirit\" by reflectively endorsing their citizenship. Members of a Hegelian State are happy even to sacrifice their lives for the State.\n\n=== Heraclitus ===\nAccording to Hegel, \"[[Heraclitus]] is the one who first declared the nature of the infinite and first grasped nature as in itself infinite, that is, its essence as process. The origin of philosophy is to be dated from Heraclitus. His is the persistent Idea that is the same in all philosophers up to the present day, as it was the Idea of Plato and Aristotle\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Hegel, G. W.

According to Hegel, Heraclitus's \"obscurity\" comes from his being a true (in Hegel's terms \"speculative\") philosopher who grasped the ultimate philosophical truth and therefore expressed himself in a way that goes beyond the abstract and limited nature of common sense and is difficult to grasp by those who operate within common sense. Hegel asserted that in Heraclitus he had an antecedent for his logic: \"[...] there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my logic\".<ref>{{cite book | first=Justus | last=Hartnack |others=Lars Aagaard-Mogensen (trans.) | title=An Introduction to Hegel's Logic | year=1998 | publisher=Hackett Publishing | isbn=0-87220-424-3| pages=16\u201317}} Hartnack quotes Hegel, ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy'', Volume I.</ref>\n\nHegel cites a number of fragments of Heraclitus in his ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hegel, G.

However, Hegel interprets not-A as not existing at all, not nothing at all, which cannot be conceived, but indeterminate or \"pure\" [[being]] without [[particular]]ity or specificity.<ref>{{cite book | first=Frederick Charles | last=Copleston | pages=Chapter X | year=2003 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn=0-8264-6901-9 | nopp=true | title=A History of Philosophy: Volume 7: 18th and 19th century German philosophy}}</ref> Pure being and pure non-being or nothingness are for Hegel pure abstractions from the reality of becoming and this is also how he interprets Heraclitus. This interpretation of Heraclitus cannot be ruled out, but even if present is not the main gist of his thought.\n\nFor Hegel, the inner movement of reality is the process of God thinking as manifested in the evolution of the universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that when fully and properly understood, [[reality]] is being [[Idealism|thought]] by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process in and through philosophy. Since human thought is the image and fulfillment of God's thought, God is not [[Ineffability|ineffable]] (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable), but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality. Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a [[dialectic|dialectical process]], so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming.\n\nFor his god, Hegel does not take the logos of Heraclitus but refers rather to the [[nous]] of [[Anaxagoras]], although he may well have regarded them the same as he continues to refer to god's plan, which is identical to God. Whatever the nous thinks at any time is actual [[Substance theory|substance]] and is identical to limited being, but more remains to be thought in the substrate of non-being, which is identical to pure or unlimited thought.\n\nThe universe as becoming is therefore a combination of being and non-being. The particular is never complete in itself, but to find completion is continually transformed into more comprehensive, complex, self-relating particulars. The essential nature of being-for-itself is that it is free \"in itself;\" that is, it does not depend on anything else such as matter for its being. The limitations represent fetters, which it must constantly be casting off as it becomes freer and more self-determining.<ref>The notable Introduction to ''Philosophy of History'' expresses the historical aspects of the dialectic.</ref>\n\nAlthough Hegel began his philosophizing with commentary on the Christian religion and often expresses the view that he is a Christian, his ideas of God are not acceptable to some Christians even though he has had a major influence on 19th- and 20th-century theology.\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs a graduate of a Protestant seminary, Hegel's theological concerns were reflected in many of his writings and lectures.<ref>\"[T]he task that touches the interest of philosophy most nearly at the present moment: to put God back at the peak of philosophy, absolutely prior to all else as the one and only ground of everything.\" (Hegel, \"How the Ordinary Human Understanding Takes Philosophy as displayed in the works of Mr. Krug\", ''Kritisches Journal der Philosophie'', I, no. 1, 1802, pages&nbsp;91\u2013115)</ref> Hegel's thoughts on the person of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] stood out from the theologies of the Enlightenment. In his posthumously published ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]], Part 3'', Hegel is shown as being particularly interested with the demonstrations of God's existence and the ontological proof.<ref>Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''[[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]]: Philosopher, Litt\u00e9rateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker.'' Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100</ref> He espouses that \"God is not an abstraction but a concrete God&nbsp;[...] God, considered in terms of his eternal Idea, has to generate the Son, has to distinguish himself from himself; he is the process of differentiating, namely, love and Spirit\". This means that Jesus as the Son of God is posited by God over against himself as other. Hegel sees both a relational unity and a metaphysical unity between Jesus and God the Father. To Hegel, Jesus is both divine and human. Hegel further attests that God (as Jesus) not only died, but \"[...]&nbsp;rather, a reversal takes place: God, that is to say, maintains himself in the process, and the latter is only the death of death. God rises again to life, and thus things are reversed\".\n\nThe philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has argued that there was great stress on the sharp criticisms of traditional Christianity appearing in Hegel's so-called early theological writings. Kaufmann admits that Hegel treated many distinctively Christian themes and \"sometimes could not resist equating\" his conception of spirit (Geist) \"with God, instead of saying clearly: in God I do not believe; spirit suffices me\".<ref>Walter Kaufmann, ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, 1965, pp. 276\u201377</ref> Kaufmann also points out that Hegel's references to God or to the divine\u2014and also to spirit\u2014drew on classical Greek as well as Christian connotations of the terms. Kaufmann goes on:\n\n<blockquote>In addition to his beloved Greeks, Hegel saw before him the example of Spinoza and, in his own time, the poetry of Goethe, Schiller, and H\u00f6lderlin, who also liked to speak of gods and the divine. So he, too, sometimes spoke of God and, more often, of the divine; and because he occasionally took pleasure in insisting that he was really closer to this or that Christian tradition than some of the theologians of his time, he has sometimes been understood to have been a Christian.<ref>[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, 1965, p. 277</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Hegel himself, his philosophy was consistent with Christianity.<ref>Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008.

''The Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' (in print from 1867-1893) was the official journal of the St. Louis Philosophical Society. The St. Louis Philosophical Society - the organization which served as the hub of the St. Louis Hegelians - had been co-founded in January 1866 by 2 disciples of Hegel in America, William Torrey Harris (1835-1909) and [[Henry Conrad Brokmeyer]] (1826-1906).

While President at Lebanon Valley College, Vickroy also held various professorships there. For example, one year he was Professor of Philosophy and the Greek Language and Literature, and another year he was Professor of Belles-Lettres and Philosophy.

It would come to have a profound impact on many future philosophical schools, including schools that opposed Hegel's specific [[dialectical idealism]], such as [[existentialism]], the [[historical materialism]] of Marx, [[historism]] and [[British idealism|British Idealism]].\n\nHegel's influence was immense both within philosophy and in the other sciences. Throughout the 19th century many chairs of philosophy around Europe were held by Hegelians and [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]\u2014among many others\u2014were all deeply influenced by, but also strongly opposed to many of the central themes of Hegel's philosophy. Scholars continue to find and point out Hegelian influences and approaches in a wide range of theoretical and/or learned works, such as [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s ''magnum opus'' on strategic thought, ''[[On War]]'' (1831).<ref>Cormier, Youri. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.2013.859166?tab=permissions#.U9etAfldXGA \"Hegel and Clausewitz: Convergence on Method, Divergence on Ethics\"], ''International History Review'', Volume 36, Issue 3, 2014.</ref> After less than a generation, Hegel's philosophy was suppressed and even banned by the [[Prussia]]n [[right-wing]] and was firmly rejected by the [[left-wing]] in multiple official writings.\n\nAfter the period of [[Bruno Bauer]], Hegel's influence did not make itself felt again until the philosophy of British Idealism and the 20th-century Hegelian [[Western Marxism]] that began with [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]]. The more recent movement of [[communitarianism]] has a strong Hegelian influence.\n\n=== Reading Hegel ===\nSome of Hegel's writing was intended for those with advanced knowledge of philosophy, although his ''Encyclopedia'' was intended as a textbook in a [[university]] [[course (education)|course]]. Nevertheless, Hegel assumes that his readers are well-versed in [[Western philosophy]]. Especially crucial are [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and Kant's immediate successors, most prominently [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. Those without this background would be well-advised to begin with one of the many general introductions to his thought. As is always the case, difficulties are magnified for those reading him in translation. In fact, Hegel himself argues in his ''Science of Logic'' that the German language was particularly conducive to philosophical thought.<ref>Hegel, G.W.F. ''Science of Logic''. trans. George di Giovanni. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2010. p.12</ref>\n\nAccording to Walter Kaufmann, the basic idea of Hegel's works, especially the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', is that a philosopher should not \"confine him or herself to views that have been held but penetrate these to the human reality they reflect\". In other words, it is not enough to consider propositions, or even the content of consciousness; \"it is worthwhile to ask in every instance what kind of spirit would entertain such propositions, hold such views, and have such a consciousness. Every outlook in other words, is to be studied not merely as an academic possibility but as an existential reality\".<ref>W. Kaufmann (1966), ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', Anchor, p. 115</ref> Kaufmann has argued that as unlikely as it may sound, it is not the case that Hegel was unable to write clearly, but that Hegel felt that \"he must and should not write in the way in which he was gifted\".<ref>W. Kaufmann, 1966, ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', p. 99</ref>\n\n=== Left and right Hegelianism ===\nSome historians have spoken of Hegel's influence as represented by two opposing camps. The [[Right Hegelians]], the allegedly direct disciples of Hegel at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t]], advocated a [[Protestant]] orthodoxy and the [[political conservatism]] of the post-[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] Restoration period. The [[Young Hegelians|Left Hegelians]], also known as the Young Hegelians, interpreted Hegel in a [[revolutionary]] sense, leading to an advocation of [[atheism]] in religion and [[liberal democracy]] in politics.\n\nIn more recent studies, this paradigm has been questioned.<ref>[[Karl L\u00f6with]], ''From Hegel to Nietzsche: The Revolution in Nineteenth-Century Thought'', translated by David E. Green, New York: Columbia University Press, 1964.</ref> No Hegelians of the period ever referred to themselves as \"Right Hegelians\", which was a term of insult originated by [[David Strauss]], a self-styled Left Hegelian. Critiques of Hegel offered from the Left Hegelians radically diverted Hegel's thinking into new directions and eventually came to form a disproportionately large part of the literature on and about Hegel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nThe Left Hegelians also influenced Marxism, which inspired global movements, encompassing the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] and myriad revolutionary practices up until the present moment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n20th-century interpretations of Hegel were mostly shaped by [[British idealism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]] and [[Fascism]]. According to [[Benedetto Croce]], the [[Italian Fascist]] [[Giovanni Gentile]] \"holds the honor of having been the most rigorous neo-Hegelian in the entire history of Western philosophy and the dishonor of having been the official philosopher of Fascism in Italy\".<ref>[[Benedetto Croce]], ''Guide to Aesthetics'', Translated by Patrick Romanell, \"Translator's Introduction\", The Library of Liberal Arts, The Bobbs\u2013Merrill Co., Inc., 1965</ref> However, since the fall of the Soviet Union a new wave of Hegel scholarship arose in the West without the preconceptions of the prior schools of thought. {{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Jaeschke|de}} and [[Otto P\u00f6ggeler]] in Germany as well as Peter Hodgson and [[Howard Kainz]] in the United States are notable for their recent contributions to post-Soviet Union thinking about Hegel.\n\n=== Triads ===\n{{main|Thesis, antithesis, synthesis}}\nIn previous modern accounts of Hegelianism (to undergraduate classes, for example), especially those formed prior to the Hegel renaissance, Hegel's [[dialectic]] was most often characterized as a three-step process, \"[[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]\"; namely, that a \"thesis\" (e.g. the [[French Revolution]]) would cause the creation of its \"antithesis\" (e.g. the [[Reign of Terror]] that followed) and would eventually result in a \"synthesis\" (e.g. the [[constitutional state]] of free citizens). However, Hegel used this classification only once and he attributed the terminology to Kant. The terminology was largely developed earlier by Fichte. It was spread by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalyb\u00e4us]] in accounts of Hegelian philosophy and since then the terms have been used as descriptive of this type of framework.\n\nThe \"thesis\u2013antithesis\u2013synthesis\" approach gives the sense that things or ideas are contradicted or opposed by things that come from outside them. To the contrary, the fundamental notion of Hegel's dialectic is that things or ideas have internal contradictions. From Hegel's point of view, analysis or comprehension of a thing or idea reveals that underneath its apparently simple identity or unity is an underlying inner contradiction. This contradiction leads to the dissolution of the thing or idea in the simple form in which it presented itself and to a higher-level, more complex thing or idea that more adequately incorporates the contradiction. The triadic form that appears in many places in Hegel (e.g. being\u2013nothingness\u2013becoming, immediate\u2013mediate\u2013concrete and abstract\u2013negative\u2013concrete) is about this movement from inner contradiction to higher-level integration or unification.\n\nFor Hegel, reason is but \"speculative\", not \"dialectical\".<ref>''Hegel and Language'', edited by Jere O'Neill Surber. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HFpQHr07IAkC&pg=PA238 p. 238].</ref> Believing that the traditional description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis\u2013antithesis\u2013synthesis was mistaken, a few scholars like [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] have attempted to discard the triadic approach altogether. According to their argument, although Hegel refers to \"the two elemental considerations: first, the idea of freedom as the absolute and final aim; secondly, the means for realising it, i.e. the subjective side of knowledge and will, with its life, movement, and activity\" (thesis and antithesis), he does not use \"synthesis\", but instead speaks of the \"Whole\": \"We then recognised the State as the moral Whole and the Reality of Freedom, and consequently as the objective unity of these two elements\". Furthermore, in Hegel's language the \"dialectical\" aspect or \"moment\" of thought and reality, by which things or thoughts turn into their opposites or have their inner contradictions brought to the surface, what he called ''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'', is only preliminary to the \"speculative\" (and not \"synthesizing\") aspect or \"moment\", which grasps the unity of these opposites or contradiction.\n\nIt is widely admitted today that the old-fashioned description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis\u2013antithesis\u2013synthesis is inaccurate. Nevertheless, such is the persistence of this misnomer that the model and terminology survive in a number of scholarly works.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gustav E. Mueller|editor=Jon Stewart|title=The Hegel Myths and Legends|url=|accessdate=|year=1996|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=0-8101-1301-5|page=301}}</ref>\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the last half of the 20th century, Hegel's philosophy underwent a major renaissance. This was due to (a) the rediscovery and re-evaluation of Hegel as a possible philosophical progenitor of Marxism by philosophically oriented Marxists; (b) a resurgence of the historical perspective that Hegel brought to everything; and (c) an increasing recognition of the importance of his [[dialectical method]]. [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]]' ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) helped to reintroduce Hegel into the Marxist canon. This sparked a renewed interest in Hegel reflected in the work of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve]] and [[Gotthard G\u00fcnther]] among others. In ''[[Reason and Revolution]]'' (1941), [[Herbert Marcuse]] made the case for Hegel as a revolutionary and criticized [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]'s thesis that Hegel was a totalitarian.<ref>{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Robinson | title=The Freudian Left: Wilhelm Reich, Geza Roheim, Herbert Marcuse | year=1990 | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=0-87220-424-3| page=156}}</ref> The Hegel renaissance also highlighted the significance of Hegel's early works, i.e. those written before ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. The direct and indirect influence of Koj\u00e8ve's lectures and writings (on ''The Phenomenology of Spirit'' in particular) mean that it is not possible to understand most French philosophers from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to [[Jacques Derrida]] without understanding Hegel.<ref>French philosopher [[Vincent Descombes]] introduced the term \"post-Koj\u00e8vian discourse\" to designate the period of French philosophy after the 1930s (Vincent Descombes, ''Modern French Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 1980, pp. 158\u20139).</ref> American [[neoconservative]] [[political science|political theorist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s controversial book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) was heavily influenced by Koj\u00e8ve.<ref>{{cite book | first=Howard | last=Williams |author2=David Sullivan |author3=Gwynn Matthews  | title=Francis Fukuyama and the End of History | year=1997 | publisher=University of Wales Press | isbn=0-7083-1428-7 | pages=70\u201371}}</ref>  The Swiss theologian [[Hans K\u00fcng]] has also advanced contemporary scholarship in Hegel studies.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, Anglo-American Hegel scholarship has attempted to challenge the traditional interpretation of Hegel as offering a metaphysical system: this has also been the approach of [[Z. A. Pelczynski]] and [[Shlomo Avineri]]. This view, sometimes referred to as the \"non-metaphysical option\", has had a decided influence on many major English language studies of Hegel in the past forty years.\n\nLate 20th-century literature in Western [[Theology]] that is friendly to Hegel includes works by such writers as [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), [[Dale M. Schlitt]] (1984), [[Theodore Geraets]] (1985), [[Philip M. Merklinger]] (1991), [[Stephen Rocker]] (1995) and [[Cyril O'Regan]] (1995).\n\nTwo prominent American philosophers, [[John McDowell]] and [[Robert Brandom]] (sometimes referred to as the \"[[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] Hegelians\"), have produced philosophical works exhibiting a marked Hegelian influence. Each is avowedly influenced by the late [[Wilfred Sellars]], also of Pittsburgh, who referred to his seminal work ''Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind'' (1956) as a series of \"incipient ''M\u00e9ditations Hegeliennes''\" (in homage to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1931 work, ''[[Cartesian Meditations|M\u00e9ditations cart\u00e9siennes]]'').\n\nBeginning in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, a fresh reading of Hegel took place in the West. For these scholars, fairly well represented by the Hegel Society of America and in cooperation with German scholars such as Otto P\u00f6ggeler and Walter Jaeschke, Hegel's works should be read without preconceptions. Marx plays little-to-no role in these new readings. Some American philosophers associated with this movement include [[Lawrence Stepelevich]], [[Rudolf Siebert]], Richard Dien Winfield and [[Theodore Geraets]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== Criticism ===\nCriticism of Hegel has been widespread in the 19th and the 20th centuries. A diverse range of individuals including [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Marx]], [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[A. J. Ayer]] have challenged Hegelian philosophy from a variety of perspectives. Among the first to take a critical view of Hegel's system was the 19th-century German group known as the [[Young Hegelians]], which included Feuerbach, Marx, Engels and their followers. In Britain, the Hegelian [[British idealism]] school (members of which included [[Francis Herbert Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] and in the United States [[Josiah Royce]]) was challenged and rejected by [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophers Moore and Russell. In particular, Russell considered \"almost all\" of Hegel's doctrines to be false.<ref>B. Russell, ''History of Western Philosophy'', chapter 22, paragraph 1, p. 701.</ref> Regarding Hegel's interpretation of history, Russell commented: \"Like other historical theories, it required, if it was to be made plausible, some distortion of facts and considerable ignorance\".<ref>Russell, 735.</ref>  [[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] such as Ayer and the [[Vienna Circle]] criticized both Hegelian philosophy and its supporters, such as Bradley.\n\nHegel's contemporary Schopenhauer was particularly critical and wrote of Hegel's philosophy as \"a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking\".<ref>On the Basis of Morality.</ref> In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of Hegel, whom Schopenhauer had also described as a \"clumsy charlatan\".<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to \"On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason. Page 1. [[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]</ref> However, only five students ended up attending Schopenhauer's lectures so he dropped out of [[academia]]. Kierkegaard criticized Hegel's \"absolute knowledge\" unity.<ref>S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard Concluding Unscientific Postscriptt</ref> The physicist and philosopher [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] also criticized the obscure complexity of Hegel's works, referring to Hegel's writing as an \"unclear thoughtless flow of words\".<ref>Ludwig Boltzmann, ''Theoretical physics and philosophical problems: Selected writings'', p. 155, [[D. Reidel]], 1974, {{ISBN|90-277-0250-0}}</ref> In a similar vein, Robert Pippin wrote that Hegel had \"the ugliest prose style in the history of the German language\".<ref>Robert B. Pippin, ''Hegel's Idealism: The Satisfaction of Self-Consciousness (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 5</ref> Russell wrote in ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) that Hegel was \"the hardest to understand of all the great philosophers\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1972|page=730}}</ref>\n\n[[Karl Popper]] wrote that \"there is so much philosophical writing (especially in the Hegelian school) which may justly be criticized as meaningless verbiage\".<ref>Karl Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (New York: Routledge, 1963), 94.</ref> Popper also makes the claim in the second volume of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Hegel's system formed a thinly veiled justification for the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute rule]] of [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] and that Hegel's idea of the ultimate goal of history was to reach a [[sovereign state|state]] approximating that of 1830s [[Prussia]]. Popper further proposed that Hegel's philosophy served not only as an inspiration for [[communism|communist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] totalitarian governments of the 20th century, whose dialectics allow for any belief to be construed as rational simply if it could be said to exist. Kaufmann and [[Shlomo Avineri]] have criticized Popper's theories about Hegel.<ref>See for instance Walter Kaufmann (1959), [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm ''The Hegel Myth and Its Method'']</ref>\n\n[[Isaiah Berlin]] listed Hegel as one of the six architects of modern [[authoritarianism]] who undermined [[liberal democracy]], along with Rousseau, [[Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius]], Fichte, [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]].<ref>Berlin, Isaiah, ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty'' (Princeton University Press, 2003)</ref>\n\nVoegelin argued that Hegel should be understood not as a philosopher, but as a \"sorcerer\", i.e. as a [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] thinker.<ref>Voegelin, Eric (1972). \"On Hegel\u2014A Study in Sorcery\", in  J.

When travelling abroad, the governor-general is seen as the representative of Australia, and of the Queen of Australia.

Only one Governor-General, [[Dame]] [[Quentin Bryce]] (2008\u20132014), has been a woman.\n\n==Method of appointment==\nThe selection of a Governor-General is a responsibility for the Prime Minister of Australia, who may consult privately with staff or colleagues, or with the monarch. The candidate is approached privately to confirm whether they are willing to accept the appointment.\n\nThe Prime Minister then advises the monarch to appoint their nominee. This has been the procedure since November 1930, when [[James Scullin]]'s proposed appointment of Sir [[Isaac Isaacs]] was fiercely opposed by the British government. This was not because of any lack of regard for Isaacs personally, but because the British government considered that the choice of Governors-General was, since the [[1926 Imperial Conference]], a matter for the monarch's decision alone. (However, it became very clear in a conversation between Scullin and King [[George V]]'s Private Secretary, [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]], on 11 November 1930, that this was merely the official reason for the objection, with the real reason being that an Australian, no matter how highly regarded personally, was not considered appropriate to be a Governor-General.) Scullin was equally insistent that the monarch must act on the relevant prime minister's direct advice (the practice until 1926 was that [[Dominion]] prime ministers advised the monarch indirectly, through the British government, which effectively had a veto over any proposal it did not agree with). Scullin cited the precedents of the [[Prime Minister of South Africa]], [[J. B. M. Hertzog]], who had recently insisted on his choice of [[George Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon|the Earl of Clarendon]] as [[Governor-General of South Africa|Governor-General of that country]], and the selection of an Irishman as [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]]. Both of these appointments had been agreed to despite British government objections.\n\nDespite these precedents, George V remained reluctant to accept Scullin's recommendation of Isaacs and asked him to consider [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|Field Marshal Sir William Birdwood]]. However, Scullin stood firm, and, on 29 November, the King agreed to Isaacs's appointment, but made it clear that he did so only because he felt he had no option.<ref>Gavin Souter, ''Acts of Parliament'', pp. 266\u2013269</ref> This right not only to advise the monarch directly, but also to expect that advice to be accepted, was soon taken up by all the other Dominion prime ministers. This, among other things, led to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] and to the formal separation of the Crowns of the Dominions. Now, the Queen of Australia is generally bound by [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] to accept the advice of the Australian prime minister and [[Premiers of the Australian states|state premiers]] about Australian and state constitutional matters, respectively.\n\nHaving agreed to the appointment, the monarch then permits it to be publicly announced in advance, usually several months before the end of the current Governor-General's term. During these months, the person is referred to as the ''Governor-General-designate''. The actual appointment is made by the monarch. After receiving his or her commission, the Governor-General takes an [[Oath of Allegiance (Australia)|Oath of Allegiance]] to the Australian monarch, an [[Oath of office|Oath of Office]], undertaking to serve Australia's monarch \"according to law, in the office of Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia\", and issues a proclamation assuming office.<ref name=\"GGSrole\"/> The oaths are usually taken in a ceremony on the floor of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and are administered by the [[Chief Justice of Australia]] in the presence of the Prime Minister of Australia, the [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives]], and the [[President of the Australian Senate]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Styles and titles of Governors-General==\nGovernors-General have during their tenure the style ''His/Her [[Excellency]] [[the Honourable]]'' and their [[Spouse of the Governor-General of Australia|spouses]] have the style ''His/Her Excellency''. Since May 2013, the style used by a former Governor-General is ''the Honourable''; it was at the same time retrospectively granted for life to all previous holders of the office.<ref name=thehon>[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013G00681 The title 'the Honourable' for Governors-General], ''Australian Government Special Gazette'' S No. 54 of 2013.</ref>\n\nFrom the creation of the [[Order of Australia]] in 1975, the Governor-General was, ex officio, [[Principal of the Order of Australia|Chancellor and Principal Companion]] of the Order, and therefore became entitled to the post-nominal AC. In 1976, the Letters Patent for the Order were amended to introduce the rank of Knight and Dame to the Order, and from that time the Governor-General became, ex officio, the Chancellor and Principal Knight of the Order. In 1986 the Letters Patent were amended again, and Governors-General appointed from that time were again, ex officio, entitled to the post-nominal AC (although if they already held a knighthood in the Order that superior rank was retained).\n\nUntil 1989, all Governors-General were members of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] and thus held the additional style ''[[the Right Honourable]]'' for life. The same individuals were also usually either [[peerage|peers]], knights, or both (the only Australian peer to be appointed as Governor-General was [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|the Lord Casey]]; and Sir [[William McKell]] was knighted only in 1951, some years into his term, but he was entitled to the style \"The Honourable\" during his tenure as Premier of New South Wales, an office he held until almost immediately before his appointment). In 1989, [[Bill Hayden]], a republican, declined appointment to the British Privy Council and any [[Australian honours system#Imperial honours|imperial honours]]. From that time until 2014, Governors-General did not receive automatic titles or honours, other than the post-nominal AC by virtue of being Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Australia. [[Quentin Bryce|Dame Quentin Bryce]] was the first Governor-General to have had no prior title or [[Pre-nominal letters|pre-nominal]] style. She was in office when, on 19 March 2014, the Queen, acting on the advice of Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], amended the Letters Patent of the Order of Australia to provide, inter alia, that the Governor-General would be, ex officio, Principal Knight or Principal Dame of the Order. Until 2015, the honour continued after the retirement from office of the Governor-General. Formerly, the Governor-General automatically became a knight or dame (if he or she was not already one previously) upon being sworn in.<ref>[http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2014-03-25/new-honour-pre-eminent-australians Prime Minister's media release \"A New Honour for Pre-eminent Australians\", 25 March 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325130621/http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2014-03-25/new-honour-pre-eminent-australians |date=25 March 2014 }}  Retrieved 2 May 2014</ref>\n\n==Backgrounds of Governors-General==\nAll the Governors-General until 1965 were [[United Kingdom|British]] born, except for Australian-born [[Isaac Isaacs|Sir Isaac Isaacs]] (1931\u20131936) and [[William McKell|Sir William McKell]] (1947\u20131953). There have been only Australian occupants since then, although [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]] (1982\u20131989) had been born in Britain. Prince [[Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], was a senior member of the Royal family. [[Quentin Bryce|Dame Quentin Bryce]] (2008\u20132014) was the first woman to be appointed to the office. Sir Isaac Isaacs and Sir Zelman Cowen were [[Jews|Jew]]ish; [[Bill Hayden]] is an avowed [[atheism|atheist]] and he made an affirmation rather than swear an oath at the beginning of his commission; the remaining Governors-General have been at least nominally [[Christian]].\n\nVarious Governor-General had previously served as governors of an Australian state or colony: [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Hopetoun]] (Victoria 1889\u20131895); [[Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]] (South Australia 1899\u20131902); [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Lord Gowrie]] (South Australia 1928\u201334; and New South Wales 1935\u20131936); Major General [[Michael Jeffery]] (Western Australia 1993\u20132000); [[Quentin Bryce|Dame Quentin Bryce]] (Queensland 2003\u20132008). [[Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar|Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson]] had been offered the governorship of South Australia in 1895 and of Victoria in 1910, but refused both appointments. [[Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote|Lord Northcote]] was [[Governor of Bombay]]. Lord Casey was [[Governor of Bengal]] in between his periods of service to the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]].\n\nFormer leading politicians and members of the judiciary have figured prominently. [[William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley|Lord Dudley]] was [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] (1902\u20131905). [[John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven|Lord Stonehaven]] (as John Baird) was Minister for Transport in the Cabinets of [[Bonar Law]] and [[Stanley Baldwin]]; and after his return to Britain he became Chairman of the UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Sir Isaac Isaacs was successively Commonwealth Attorney-General, a High Court judge, and Chief Justice. Sir William McKell was Premier of New South Wales. [[William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil|Lord Dunrossil]] (as William Morrison) was [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the UK House of Commons]]. [[William Sidney, 1st Viscount De L'Isle|Lord De L'Isle]] was [[Secretary of State for Air]] in [[Winston Churchill]]'s cabinet from 1951 to 1955. More recent Governors-General in this category include Lord Casey, [[Paul Hasluck|Sir Paul Hasluck]], [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]], [[Bill Hayden]] and [[William Deane|Sir William Deane]].\n\nOf the ten Australians appointed governor-general since 1965, [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Lord Casey]], Sir Paul Hasluck and [[Bill Hayden]] were former federal [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]]; Sir John Kerr was the [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]]; Sir Ninian Stephen and Sir William Deane were appointed from the bench of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]; [[Zelman Cowen|Sir Zelman Cowen]] was a [[Vice-Chancellor|vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of Queensland]] and constitutional lawyer; [[Peter Hollingworth]] was the [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Brisbane]]; and Major-General Michael Jeffery was a retired [[Officer (armed forces)|military officer]] and former [[Governor of Western Australia]].

At the end of this period, a commission is occasionally extended for a short time.<ref name=\"GGSrole\"/>\n\nThe salary of the Governor-General is regulated by the constitution, which fixed an annual amount of 10,000 [[Australian pound|pounds]], unless the Parliament decides otherwise. The salary of the Governor-General cannot be \"altered\" during his or her term of office.<ref>[[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] section 3.</ref> Under the ''Governor-General Act 1974'' (Cth), each new commission has resulted in a pay increase. Today, the law ensures the salary is higher than that for the [[Chief Justice of Australia|Chief Justice]] of the High Court, over a five-year period. The annual salary during Michael Jeffery's term was $365,000. Quentin Bryce's salary was $394,000.<ref name=QBS>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23881081-662,00.html Herald Sun, 18 June 2008, Governor-General Quentin Bryce to get pay rise]</ref> The current salary is $425,000 and there is a generous pension.<ref>''Governor-General Act 1974'' (Cth), sections 3 and 4;  the pension is 60% of the salary of the [[Chief Justice of Australia|Chief Justice]] at the end of the Governor-General's term.</ref> Until 2001, Governors-General did not pay income tax on their salary; this was changed after the Queen agreed to pay tax.<ref name=QBS/>\n\nThree Governors-General have resigned their commission. The first Governor-General, [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Hopetoun]], asked to be recalled to Britain in 1903 over a dispute about funding for the post. [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]] resigned in 1977, with his official reason being his decision to accept the position of Australian Ambassador to [[UNESCO]] in Paris, a post which ultimately he did not take up. In 2003, Archbishop [[Peter Hollingworth]] voluntarily stood aside while controversial allegations against him were managed, and the [[letters patent]] of the office were amended to take account of this circumstance. He later \"stepped down over the church's handling\" of \"allegations\" of sexual abuse of boys, for which he apologised before the [[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse]] in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/03/peter-hollingworth-apologises-for-poor-handling-of-sex-abuse-complaint|title=Peter Hollingworth apologises for poor handling of sex abuse complaint|first=Australian Associated|last=Press|date=2 February 2016|website=the Guardian|accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref> In 1961, [[William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil|Lord Dunrossil]] became the first and, to date, only Governor-General to die while holding office.\n\nA Governor-General may be recalled or dismissed by the monarch before their term is complete. By convention, this may only be upon advice from the prime minister, who retains responsibility for selecting an immediate replacement or letting the vacancy provisions take effect. No Australian Governor-General has ever been dismissed, and it is unclear how quickly the monarch would act on such advice. The [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1975]] raised the possibility of the prime minister and the Governor-General attempting to dismiss each other at the same time. According to [[William McMahon]], [[Harold Holt]] considered having [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Lord Casey]] dismissed from the governor-generalship, and went as far as to have the necessary documents drawn up. Casey had twice called McMahon into Yarralumla to give him a \"dressing down\" over his poor relationship with Deputy Prime Minister [[John McEwen]], which he believed was affecting the government. Holt believed that this was an improper use of his authority, but no further action was taken.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/102077013|title=McMahon 'in Casey row'|date=4 April 1988|publisher=''[[The Canberra Times]]''}}</ref>\n\nA vacancy occurs on the resignation, death, or incapacity of the Governor-General. A temporary vacancy occurs when the Governor-General is overseas on official business representing Australia. A temporary vacancy also occurred in 2003 when Peter Hollingworth stood aside.\n\nSection 4 of the constitution allows the Queen to appoint an [[Administrator (Australia)|administrator]] to carry out the role of Governor-General when there is a vacancy.<ref>[[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] section 4.</ref> By convention, the longest-serving state governor holds a [[dormant commission]], allowing an assumption of office to commence whenever a vacancy occurs. In 1975, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] advised the Queen that [[Colin Hannah|Sir Colin Hannah]], then [[Governor of Queensland]], should have his dormant commission revoked for having made public political statements.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Constitutional role and functions==\n{{Further|Australian head of state dispute}}\nThe Constitution of Australia, section 2, provides:<blockquote>A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in the Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasure, but subject to this Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as Her Majesty may be pleased to assign to him.<ref>[[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]], section 2.</ref></blockquote>Such further powers are currently set out in [[letters patent]] of 2008 from Queen Elizabeth II;  these contain no substantive powers, but provide for the case of a Governor-General's absence or incapacity.<ref>[http://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/S179-2008-LettersPatent.pdf Letters Patent, 21 August 2008].

It is also, in the same section, declared to be \"exercisable\" by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative.

Through her Private Secretary, she wrote that she \"has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution\".<ref name=HorP5E>{{Cite web | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/practice/chapter1 | title =  House of Representatives Practice (5th Edition) | publisher = Parliament of Australia | accessdate = 15 December 2014}}</ref>\nIn an address to the Sydney Institute, January 2007, in connection with that event, Sir [[David Smith (public servant)|David Smith]], a retired [[Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia]], described the constitution as  conferring the powers and functions of Australia's head of state on the Governor-General in \"his own right\". He stated that the Governor-General was more than a representative of the sovereign, explaining: \"under section 2 of the Constitution the Governor-General is the Queen's representative and exercises certain royal prerogative powers and functions; under section 61 of the Constitution the Governor-General is the holder of a quite separate and independent office created, not by the Crown, but by the Constitution, and empowered to exercise, in his own right as Governor-General... all the powers and functions of Australia's head of state.\"<ref name=norepublic />\n\n===Role in the Australian Parliament===\nThe constitution describes the parliament of the commonwealth as consisting of the Queen, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Section 5 states that \"the Governor-General may appoint such times for holding the sessions of the Parliament [...] [[legislative session|prorogue]] the Parliament [and] dissolve the House of Representatives.\" These provisions make it clear that the Queen's role in the parliament is in name only and the actual responsibility belongs to the Governor-General. Such decisions are usually taken on the advice of the prime minister, although that is not stated in the constitution.\n\nThe Governor-General has a ceremonial role in swearing in and accepting the resignations of Members of Parliament. They appoint a deputy, to whom members make an [[Oath of Allegiance (Australia)|oath of allegiance]] before they take their seats. On the day parliament opens, the Governor-General makes a speech, entirely written by the government, explaining the government's proposed legislative program.\n\nThe most important power is found in section 58: \"When a proposed law passed by both Houses of Parliament is presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare ... that he assents in the Queen's name.\" The [[royal assent]] brings such laws into effect, as legislation, from the date of signing.\n\nSections 58 to 60 allow the Governor-General to withhold assent, suggest changes, refer to the Queen or proclaim that the Queen has annulled the legislation. A number of Governors-General have reserved Royal Assent for particular legislation for the Queen. Such assent has usually been given during a scheduled visit to Australia by the Queen. On other occasions Royal Assent has been given elsewhere. Examples of this have been the [[Flags Act 1953|Flags Act]] (1953), the Royal Styles and Titles Acts (1953 and 1973), and the [[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act]] (1986).\n\n===Role in executive government===\nAt the start of Chapter 2 on executive government, the constitution says \"The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative\". The Governor-General presides over a [[Executive Council of Australia|Federal Executive Council]]. By convention, the prime minister is appointed to this council and advises as to which parliamentarians shall become [[Minister (government)|ministers]] and [[Parliamentary Secretary|parliamentary secretaries]].\n\nIn the constitution, the words \"Governor-General-in-council\" mean the Governor-General acting with the advice of the Council. Powers exercised in council, which are not reserve powers, include:\n* establishing government departments\n* appointing federal judges, and\n* appointing ambassadors and high commissioners\n\nAll such actions are taken on the advice of ministers.\n\n===Military role===\nUnder [[Section 68 of the Constitution of Australia|section 68 of the constitution]], \"the [[Commander-in-chief|command in chief]] of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor\u2011General\". In practice, the associated powers over the [[Australian Defence Force]] are only exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]], on behalf of cabinet.<ref name=GGSrole/> The actual powers of the Governor-General as commander-in-chief are not defined in the constitution, but rather in the ''Defence Act 1903'' and other legislation. They include appointing the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] and authorising the deployment of troops.<ref>{{cite article|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/bn/pol/parliamentaryinvolvement.pdf|publisher=Parliamentary Library of Australia|author=Deirdre McKeown and Roy Jordan|date=22 March 2010|title=Parliamentary involvement in declaring war and deploying forces overseas|page=1\u20132}}</ref>  There is some ambiguity with regard to the role of the Governor-General in declarations of war.<ref>McKeown and Jordan (2010), p. 3.</ref> In 1941 and 1942, the [[Curtin Government]] advised the Governor-General to declare war on several [[Axis powers]], but then had [[King George VI]] make identical proclamations on Australia's behalf.<ref>McKeown and Jordan (2010), p. 4.</ref> No formal declarations of war have been made since World War II, although in 1973 the [[Whitlam Government]] advised the Governor-General to proclaim the end of [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australia's involvement in Vietnam]], despite the lack of an initiating proclamation.<ref>McKeown and Jordan (2010), p. 32.</ref>\n\nThe powers of command-in-chief are vested in the Governor-General rather than the \"Governor-General in Council\", meaning there is an element of personal discretion in their exercise.<ref>{{cite article|author=[[Ninian Stephen]]|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/about-governor-general/governor-general-commander-chief|title=The Governor-General as Commander-in-Chief|date=21 June 1983}}</ref> For instance, in 1970 Governor-General [[Paul Hasluck]] refused Prime Minister [[John Gorton]]'s request to authorise a [[Pacific Islands Regiment]] peacekeeping mission in the [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]], on the grounds that cabinet had not been consulted.

It is generally held that the Governor-General may use powers without ministerial advice in the following situations:\n* if an election results in a parliament in which no party has a majority, the Governor-General may select the Prime Minister\n* if a Prime Minister loses the support of the House of Representatives, the Governor-General may appoint a new Prime Minister\n* if a Prime Minister advises a dissolution of the House of Representatives, the Governor-General may refuse that request, or request further reasons why it should be granted; it is worth noting that convention does not give the Governor-General the ability to dissolve either the House of Representatives or the Senate without advice\n\nThe use of the reserve powers may arise in the following circumstances:\n* if a Prime Minister advises a dissolution of Parliament on the occasion of a deadlock between the Houses, the Governor-General may refuse that request\n* if the Governor-General is not satisfied with a legislative bill as presented, they may refuse royal assent\n* if a Prime Minister resigns after losing a vote of confidence, the Governor-General may select a new replacement contrary to the advice of the outgoing Prime Minister\n* if a Prime Minister is unable to obtain supply and refuses to resign or advise a dissolution, the Governor-General may dismiss him or her and appoint a new Prime Minister\n\nThe above is not an exhaustive list, and new situations may arise. The most notable use of the reserve powers occurred in November 1975, in the course of the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. On this occasion the Governor-General, [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], dismissed the government of [[Gough Whitlam]] when the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] withheld Supply to the government, even though Whitlam retained the confidence of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Kerr determined that he had both the right and the duty to dismiss the government and commission a new government that would recommend a dissolution of the Parliament.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Events surrounding the dismissal remain extremely controversial.\n\n==Ceremonial role==\n[[File:WilliamMorrisonDunrossil.jpg|thumb|[[William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil|Viscount Dunrossil]], 14th Governor-General of Australia (1960\u201361), in his court uniform, with his vice-regal consort, Viscountess Dunrossil.]]\nIn addition to the formal constitutional role, the Governor-General has a representative and ceremonial role, though the extent and nature of that role has depended on the expectations of the time, the individual in office at the time, the wishes of the incumbent government, and the individual's reputation in the wider community. Governors-General generally become patrons of various charitable institutions, present honours and awards, host functions for various groups of people including ambassadors to and from other countries, and travel widely throughout Australia. [[William Deane|Sir William Deane]] (Governor-General 1996\u20132001) described one of his functions as being \"Chief Mourner\" at prominent funerals. In ''Commentaries on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia'', Garran noted that, since the Australian executive is national in nature (being dependent on the nationally elected House of Representatives, rather than the Senate), \"the Governor-General, as the official head of the Executive, does not in the smallest degree represent any federal element; if he represents anything he is the image and embodiment of national unity and the outward and visible representation of the Imperial relationship of the Commonwealth\".<ref>[http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/ozlit/pdf/fed0014.pdf p700]</ref>\n[[Image:Flag of the Governor-General of Australia.svg|thumb|left|[[Flag of the Governor-General of Australia]] since 1936]]\n\nThat role can become controversial, however, if the Governor-General becomes unpopular with sections of the community. The public role adopted by [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]] was curtailed considerably after the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1975]]; Sir William Deane's public statements on political issues produced some hostility towards him; and some charities disassociated themselves from [[Peter Hollingworth]] after the issue of his management of sex abuse cases during his time as Anglican [[Anglican Diocese of Brisbane|Archbishop of Brisbane]] became a matter of controversy.\n\nAt one time, Governors-General wore the traditional [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom#Foreign Service variants|court uniform]], consisting of a dark navy wool double-breasted coatee with silver oak leaf and fern embroidery on the collar and cuffs trimmed with silver buttons embossed with the Royal Arms and with bullion edged epaulettes on the shoulders, dark navy trousers with a wide band of silver oak-leaf braid down the outside seam, silver sword belt with ceremonial sword, bicorne cocked hat with plume of ostrich feathers, black patent leather Wellington boots with spurs, etc., that is worn on ceremonial occasions.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/dresswornathisma00trenuoft Dress worn at His Majesty's court : issued with the authority of the Lord Chamberlain] (1912), pp. 49, 50</ref> There is also a tropical version made of white tropical wool cut in a typical military fashion worn with a plumed helmet.

After the initial confusion of the [[Hopetoun Blunder]], he appointed the first [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Edmund Barton]], to a caretaker government, with the [[Australian federal election, 1901|inaugural 1901 federal election]] not occurring until March.\n\nEarly Governors-General were British and were appointed by the Queen or King on the recommendation of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]]. The Australian Government was merely asked, as a matter of courtesy, whether they approved of the choice or not. Governors-General were expected{{by whom|date=February 2014}} to exercise a supervisory role over the Australian Government in the manner of a colonial governor. In a very real sense, they represented the British Government. They had the right to \"reserve\" legislation passed by the [[Parliament of Australia]]: in effect, to ask the [[Colonial Office]] in London for an opinion before giving the [[Royal Assent|royal assent]].<ref>Constitution section 58.</ref> They exercised this power several times.  The Queen (that is, the UK monarch acting upon advice of the British Government) could also disallow any Australian legislation up to a year after the Governor-General had given it the assent;  although this power has never been used.<ref>Constitution section 59.</ref> These powers remain in the Constitution, but today are regarded as dead letters.\n\nThe early Governors-General frequently sought advice on the exercise of their powers from two judges of the [[High Court of Australia]], [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]] and [[Edmund Barton|Sir Edmund Barton]].<ref>[[Donald Markwell]], \"Griffith, Barton and the Early Governor-Generals: Aspects of Australia's Constitutional Development\" (1999) 10 ''Public Law Review'' 280.</ref> That practice has continued from time to time.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the importance of the position declined. As a result of decisions made at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]], the Governor-General ceased to represent the British Government diplomatically, and the British right of supervision over Australian affairs was abolished. As the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], later implemented as the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], put it:<blockquote>It is desirable formally to place on record a definition of the position held by the Governor-General as His Majesty's representative in the Dominions. That position, though now generally well recognised, undoubtedly represents a development from an earlier stage when the Governor-General was appointed solely on the advice of His Majesty's Ministers in London and acted also as their representative. In our opinion it is an essential consequence of the equality of status existing among the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that the Governor-General of a Dominion is the representative of [[the Crown]], holding in all essential respects the same position in relation to the administration of public affairs in the Dominion as is held by His Majesty the King in Great Britain, and that he is not the representative or agent of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain or of any Department of that Government.</blockquote> However, it remained unclear just whose prerogative it now became to decide who new Governors-General  would be. In 1930, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and the Australian Prime Minister [[James Scullin]] discussed the appointment of a new Governor-General to replace Lord Stonehaven, whose term was coming to an end. The King maintained that it was now his sole prerogative to choose a Governor-General, and he wanted [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|Field-Marshal Sir William Birdwood]] for the Australian post. Scullin recommended the Australian jurist [[Isaac Isaacs|Sir Isaac Isaacs]], and he insisted that George V act on the advice of his Australian prime minister in this matter. Scullin was partially influenced by the precedent set by the [[Government of the Irish Free State]], which always insisted upon having an Irishman as the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]].\n\nThe King approved Scullin's choice, albeit with some displeasure. The usual wording of official announcements of this nature read \"The King has been pleased to appoint ...\", but on this occasion the announcement said merely \"The King has appointed ...\", and his [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|Private Secretary]] ([[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]]) asked the Australian Solicitor-General, [[Robert Garran|Sir Robert Garran]], to make sure that Scullin was aware of the exact wording.<ref>Gavin Souter, ''Acts of Parliament'', p. 269</ref> The opposition [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] denounced the appointment as \"practically republican\", but Scullin had set a precedent. The convention gradually became established throughout the Commonwealth that the Governor-General is a citizen of the country concerned, and is appointed on the advice of the government of that country.\n\nIn 1931, the transformation was concluded with the appointment of the first Australian Governor-General, Isaacs, and the first British Representative in Australia, [[Ernest Crutchley]]. 1935 saw the appointment of the first [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Australia|British High Commissioner to Australia]], [[Geoffrey Whiskard]] (in office 1936\u20131941).\n\nAfter Scullin's defeat in [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931]], non-[[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] governments continued to recommend British people for appointment as Governor-General, but such appointments remained solely a matter between the Australian government and the monarch. In 1947, Labor appointed a second Australian Governor-General, [[William McKell]], who was in office as the Labor [[Premier of New South Wales]]. The then Leader of the Opposition, [[Robert Menzies]], called McKell's appointment \"shocking and humiliating\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lamont|first1=Leonie|title=Signposts|journal=Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 March 2004|volume=37}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965 the Menzies conservative government appointed an Australian, [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Lord Casey]], and thereafter only Australians have held the position. Suggestions during the early 1980s that the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] might become the Governor-General came to nothing due to the prospective constitutional difficulty that might ensue if Prince Charles became King.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 2007 media outlets reported that [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] might become Governor-General of Australia. Both the Prime Minister, [[John Howard]], and [[Clarence House]] repudiated the suggestion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Squires|first=Nick|date=30 June 2007|title=Australians reject role for Prince William|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1556101/Australians-reject-role-for-Prince-William.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Pierce|first=Andrew|date=23 November 2009|title=Prince William and Prince Harry: A firm foundation for the brothers in arms|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/6634096/Prince-William-and-Prince-Harry-A-firm-foundation-for-the-brothers-in-arms.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Patronage==\nThe Governor-General is generally invited to become Patron of various charitable and service organisations.

It was an ordinary, hardworking, non-descript word that was used to refer to a process, any process of justice or governance, being conducted in the open.\"<ref>Alexeyeva, Lyudmila and Paul Goldberg ''The Thaw Generation: Coming of Age in the Post-Stalin Era'', Pennsylvania: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, pp. 108-109.</ref> In the mid-1960s, however, as Alexeyeva recounts, it acquired a new and topical importance.\n\n==Glasnost in the USSR==\n===Glasnost and the dissidents===\nOn 5 December 1965, a key event in the emergence of the Soviet civil rights movement, often known as the [[Glasnost meeting| Glasnost rally]], took place in Moscow when protesters on Pushkin Square led by [[Alexander Yesenin-Volpin]] demanded access to the closed trial of [[Yuli Daniel| Yuly Daniel]] and [[Andrei Sinyavsky]]. They specifically asked for \"glasnost\", i.e. the admission of the public, independent observers and foreign journalists, to the trial, something that was required in the newly issued, but not widely available, Code of Criminal Procedure. With a few specified exceptions, Article 111 of the Code stated that judicial hearings in the USSR should be held in public.\n\nSuch protests against closed trials continued throughout the post-Stalin era. [[Andrei Sakharov]], famously, did not travel to Oslo to receive his [[Nobel Peace Prize]] because he was standing outside a court building in Vilnius (Lithuania), demanding access to the 1976 trial of [[Sergei Kovalev]], an editor of the ''[[Chronicle of Current Events]]'' and prominent rights activist.<ref>https://chronicleofcurrentevents.net/2016/03/07/38-2-before-the-trials-of-kovalyov-and-tverdokhlebov/</ref>\n\n===Glasnost and Gorbachev===\nIn 1986, aware of the term's historical and more recent resonance, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his advisers adopted \"glasnost\" as a political slogan, together with the obscure \"[[perestroika]]\".\n\nGlasnost was taken to mean increased openness and [[Transparency (social)|transparency]] in government institutions and activities in the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR).<ref>{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Milestones in Glasnost and Perestroyka: Politics and People | publisher = Brookings Institution Press | year = 1991 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8157-3623-1 }}</ref> ''Glasnost'' apparently reflected a commitment to getting Soviet citizens to discuss publicly the problems of their system and seek solutions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=315|oclc=907585907}}</ref> Gorbachev encouraged popular scrutiny and criticism of leaders, as well as a certain level of exposure by the mass media.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=316|oclc=907585907}}</ref> Some critics, especially among legal reformers and dissidents, regarded the Soviet authorities' new slogans as vague and limited alternatives to more basic liberties. \n\nAlexei Simonov, president of the Glasnost Defence Foundation, would define the term as follows: \"Glasnost is a tortoise crawling towards Freedom of Speech\".<ref>http://www.gdf.ru</ref> \n\n====Various meanings of Gorbachev's \"glasnost\"====\nBetween 1986 and 1991, when the USSR attempted and failed to reform itself, glasnost was frequently linked with other generalised concepts such as [[perestroika]] (literally: restructuring or regrouping) and [[Demokratizatsiya (Soviet Union)|demokratizatsiya]] (democratisation). Gorbachev often appealed to glasnost when promoting policies aimed at reducing corruption at the top of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and moderating the abuse of administrative power in the [[Central Committee]].\n\nThe ambiguity of \"glasnost\" defines the distinctive five-year period (1986\u20131991) at the end of the USSR's existence. There was decreasing pre-publication and pre-broadcast [[censorship]] and greater [[freedom of information]].\n\nThe \"Era of Glasnost\" saw greater contact between Soviet citizens and the Western world, particularly the [[United States]]: restrictions on travel were loosened for many, allowing increased business and cultural interchange{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.\n\n====International Relations under Glasnost====\nGorbachev's interpretation of \"glasnost\" can best be summarized, translated, and explained in English as \"openness\".

[[geodynamics|Geodynamical]] phenomena include [[crust (geology)|crustal]] motion, [[tide]]s, and [[polar motion]], which can be studied by designing global and national [[control network]]s, applying [[Space techniques|space]] and terrestrial techniques, and relying on [[datum (geodesy)|datum]]s and [[coordinate system]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe word \"geodesy\" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}} ''geodaisia'' (literally, \"division of the Earth\").\n\nIt is primarily concerned with positioning within the [[time|temporally]] varying gravity field. Geodesy in the [[German language|German]]-speaking world is divided into \"higher geodesy\" (\"''Erdmessung''\" or \"''h\u00f6here Geod\u00e4sie''\"), which is concerned with measuring the Earth on the global scale, and \"practical geodesy\" or \"engineering geodesy\" (\"''Ingenieurgeod\u00e4sie''\"), which is concerned with measuring specific parts or regions of the Earth, and which includes [[surveying]]. Such geodetic operations are also applied to other astronomical bodies in the [[solar system]]. It is also the science of measuring and understanding the earth's geometric shape, orientation in space, and gravity field.\n\nTo a large extent, the shape of the Earth is the result of its [[Earth's rotation|rotation]], which causes its [[equatorial bulge]], and the competition of geological processes such as the [[Continental collision|collision of plates]] and of [[Volcano|volcanism]], resisted by the Earth's [[gravity]] field. This applies to the solid surface, the liquid surface ([[dynamic sea surface topography]]) and the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. For this reason, the study of the Earth's [[gravity field]] is called [[physical geodesy]].\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of geodesy}}\n\n== Geoid and reference ellipsoid ==\n{{see also|Geoid}}\n\nThe [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographical features. It is an idealized equilibrium surface of [[sea water]], the [[mean sea level]] surface in the absence of [[Ocean current|currents]] and [[Atmospheric pressure|air pressure]] variations, and continued under the continental masses. The geoid, unlike the [[reference ellipsoid]], is irregular and too complicated to serve as the computational surface on which to solve geometrical problems like point positioning. The geometrical separation between the geoid and the reference ellipsoid is called the geoidal [[wiktionary:undulate|undulation]]. It varies globally between \u00b1110&nbsp;m, when referred to the GRS&nbsp;80 ellipsoid.\n\nA [[reference ellipsoid]], customarily chosen to be the same size (volume) as the geoid, is described by its semi-major axis (equatorial\nradius) ''a'' and flattening ''f''. The quantity ''f''&nbsp;= {{sfrac|''a'' \u2212 ''b''|''a''}}, where ''b'' is the semi-minor axis (polar radius), is a purely geometrical one. The mechanical ellipticity of the Earth (dynamical flattening, symbol ''J''<sub>2</sub>) can be determined to high precision by observation of satellite [[Orbital perturbation analysis|orbit perturbations]]. Its relationship with the geometrical flattening is indirect. The relationship depends on the internal density distribution, or, in simplest terms, the degree of central concentration of mass.\n\nThe 1980 Geodetic Reference System ([[GRS80|GRS&nbsp;80]]) posited a 6,378,137&nbsp;m semi-major axis and a 1:298.257 flattening. This system was adopted at the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics ([[IUGG]]). It is essentially the basis for geodetic positioning by the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and is thus also in widespread use outside the geodetic community. The numerous systems that countries have used to create maps and charts are becoming obsolete as countries increasingly move to global, geocentric reference systems using the GRS&nbsp;80 reference ellipsoid.\n\nThe geoid is \"realizable\", meaning it can be consistently located on the Earth by suitable simple measurements from physical objects like a tide gauge. The geoid can therefore be considered a real surface. The reference ellipsoid, however, has many possible instantiations and is not readily realizable, therefore it is an abstract surface. The third primary surface of geodetic interest\u2014the topographic surface of the Earth\u2014is a realizable surface.\n\n== Coordinate systems in space ==\n{{see also|Geodetic system}}\n\nThe locations of points in three-dimensional space are most conveniently described by three [[cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] or rectangular coordinates, ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z''. Since the advent of satellite positioning, such coordinate systems are typically [[geocentric]]: the ''Z''-axis is aligned with the Earth's (conventional or instantaneous) rotation axis.\n\nPrior to the era of [[satellite geodesy]], the coordinate systems associated with a geodetic [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] attempted to be [[geocentric]], but their origins differed from the geocenter by hundreds of meters, due to regional deviations in the direction of the [[plumbline]] (vertical). These regional geodetic data, such as [[ED50|ED&nbsp;50]] (European Datum 1950) or [[North American Datum#North American Datum of 1927|NAD&nbsp;27]] (North American Datum 1927) have ellipsoids associated with them that are regional \"best fits\" to the [[geoid]]s within their areas of validity, minimizing the deflections of the vertical over these areas.\n\nIt is only because [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites orbit about the geocenter, that this point becomes naturally the origin of a coordinate system defined by satellite geodetic means, as the satellite positions in space are themselves computed in such a system.\n\nGeocentric coordinate systems used in geodesy can be divided naturally into two classes:\n# [[Inertial]] reference systems, where the coordinate axes retain their orientation relative to the [[fixed star]]s, or equivalently, to the rotation axes of ideal [[gyroscopes]]; the ''X''-axis points to the [[vernal equinox]]\n# Co-rotating, also [[ECEF]] (\"Earth Centred, Earth Fixed\"), where the axes are attached to the solid body of the Earth. The ''X''-axis lies within the [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]] observatory's [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] plane.\n\nThe coordinate transformation between these two systems is described to good approximation by (apparent) [[sidereal time]], which takes into account variations in the Earth's axial rotation ([[day|length-of-day]] variations). A more accurate description also takes [[polar motion]] into account, a phenomenon closely monitored by geodesists.\n\n=== Coordinate systems in the plane ===\nIn [[surveying]] and [[map]]ping, important fields of application of geodesy, two general types of coordinate systems are used in the plane:\n\n# Plano-polar, in which points in a plane are defined by a distance ''s'' from a specified point along a ray having a specified direction ''\u03b1'' with respect to a base line or axis;\n# Rectangular, points are defined by distances from two perpendicular axes called ''x'' and ''y''. It is geodetic practice\u2014contrary to the mathematical convention\u2014to let the ''x''-axis point to the north and the ''y''-axis to the east.\n\nRectangular coordinates in the plane can be used intuitively with respect to one's current location, in which case the ''x''-axis will point to the local north. More formally, such coordinates can be obtained from three-dimensional coordinates using the artifice of a [[map projection]]. It is ''not'' possible to map the curved surface of the Earth onto a flat map surface without deformation. The compromise most often chosen\u2014called a [[conformal projection]]\u2014preserves angles and length ratios, so that small circles are mapped as small circles and small squares as squares.\n\nAn example of such a projection is UTM ([[Universal Transverse Mercator]]). Within the map plane, we have rectangular coordinates ''x'' and ''y''. In this case the north direction used for reference is the ''map'' north, not the ''local'' north. The difference between the two is called [[Transverse Mercator projection#Convergence|meridian convergence]].\n\nIt is easy enough to \"translate\" between polar and rectangular coordinates in the plane: let, as above, direction and distance be ''\u03b1'' and ''s'' respectively, then we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx &= s \\cos \\alpha\\\\\ny &= s \\sin \\alpha\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe reverse transformation is given by:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ns &= \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\\\\n\\alpha &= \\arctan\\frac{y}{x}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Heights ==\nIn geodesy, point or terrain ''[[height]]s'' are \"[[above sea level]]\", an irregular, physically defined surface. Therefore, a height should ideally ''not'' be referred to as a coordinate.  It is more like a physical quantity, and though it can be tempting to treat height as the vertical coordinate ''z'', in addition to the horizontal coordinates ''x'' and ''y'', and though this actually is a good approximation of physical reality in small areas, it quickly becomes invalid for regional considerations. {{Specify|date=December 2006}}\n\nHeights come in the following variants:\n\n# [[Orthometric height]]s\n# [[Normal height]]s\n# [[Geopotential height]]s\n\nEach has its advantages and disadvantages. Both orthometric and normal heights are heights in metres above sea level, whereas geopotential numbers are measures of potential energy (unit: m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>\u22122</sup>) and not metric. Orthometric and normal heights differ in the precise way in which mean sea level is conceptually continued under the continental masses. The reference surface for orthometric heights is the [[geoid]], an equipotential surface approximating mean sea level.\n\n''None'' of these heights is in any way related to '''geodetic''' or '''ellipsoidial''' heights, which express the height of a point above the [[reference ellipsoid]]. Satellite positioning receivers typically provide ellipsoidal heights, unless they are fitted with special conversion software based on a model of the [[geoid]].\n\n== Geodetic data ==\nBecause geodetic point coordinates (and heights) are always obtained in a system that has been constructed itself using real observations, geodesists introduce the concept of a \"geodetic datum\": a physical realization of a coordinate system used for describing point locations. The realization is the result of ''choosing'' conventional coordinate values for one or more datum points.\n\nIn the case of height data, it suffices to choose ''one'' datum point: the reference benchmark, typically a tide gauge at the shore. Thus we have vertical data like the NAP ([[Normaal Amsterdams Peil]]), the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD&nbsp;88), the Kronstadt datum, the Trieste datum, and so on.\n\nIn case of plane or spatial coordinates, we typically need several datum points. A regional, ellipsoidal datum like [[ED50|ED&nbsp;50]] can be fixed by prescribing the [[undulation of the geoid]] and the deflection of the vertical in ''one'' datum point, in this case the Helmert Tower in [[Potsdam]]. However, an overdetermined ensemble of datum points can also be used.\n\nChanging the coordinates of a point set referring to one datum, so to make them refer to another datum, is called a ''datum transformation''. In the case of vertical data, this consists of simply adding a constant shift to all height values. In the case of plane or spatial coordinates, datum transformation takes the form of a similarity or ''Helmert transformation'', consisting of a rotation and scaling operation in addition to a simple translation. In the plane, a [[Helmert transformation]] has four parameters; in space, seven.\n\n;A note on terminology\n\nIn the abstract, a coordinate system as used in mathematics and geodesy is called a \"coordinate system\" in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] terminology, whereas the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS) uses the term \"reference system\". When these coordinates are realized by choosing datum points and fixing a geodetic datum, ISO says \"coordinate reference system\", while IERS says \"reference frame\". The ISO term for a datum transformation again is a \"coordinate transformation\".<ref>(ISO 19111: Spatial referencing by coordinates).</ref>\n\n== Point positioning ==\n[[File:Geodetic Control Mark.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Geodetic Control Mark (example of a [[Benchmark (surveying)|deep benchmark]])]]\n\nPoint positioning is the determination of the coordinates of a point on land, at sea, or in space with respect to a coordinate system. Point position is solved by computation from measurements linking the known positions of terrestrial or extraterrestrial points with the unknown terrestrial position. This may involve transformations between or among astronomical and terrestrial coordinate systems. The known points used for point positioning can be [[triangulation]] points of a higher-order network or [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites.\n\nTraditionally, a hierarchy of networks has been built to allow point positioning within a country. Highest in the hierarchy were triangulation networks. These were densified into networks of [[traverse (surveying)|traverse]]s ([[polygons]]), into which local mapping surveying measurements, usually with measuring tape, [[Corner reflector|corner prism]], and the familiar{{where?|date=January 2017}} red and white poles, are tied.\n\nNowadays all but special measurements (e.g., underground or high-precision engineering measurements) are performed with [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. The higher-order networks are measured with [[Global Positioning System|static GPS]], using differential measurement to determine vectors between terrestrial points. These vectors are then adjusted in traditional network fashion. A global polyhedron of permanently operating GPS stations under the auspices of the [[IERS]] is used to define a single global, geocentric reference frame which serves as the \"zero order\" global reference to which national measurements are attached.\n\nFor [[surveying]] mappings, frequently [[Real Time Kinematic]] GPS is employed, tying in the unknown points with known terrestrial points close by in real time.\n\nOne purpose of point positioning is the provision of known points for mapping measurements, also known as (horizontal and vertical) control.\nIn every country, thousands of such known points exist and are normally documented by national mapping agencies. Surveyors involved in real estate and insurance will use these to tie their local measurements.\n\n== Geodetic problems ==\n{{Main|Geodesics on an ellipsoid}}\n\nIn geometric geodesy, two standard problems exist\u2014the first (direct or forward) and the second (inverse or reverse).\n\n;First (direct or forward) geodetic problem\n\n: Given a point (in terms of its coordinates) and the direction ([[azimuth]]) and [[distance]] from that point to a second point, determine (the coordinates of) that second point.\n\n;Second (inverse or reverse) geodetic problem\n\n: Given two points, determine the azimuth and length of the line (straight line, arc or [[geodesic]]) that connects them.\n\nIn plane geometry (valid for small areas on the Earth's surface), the solutions to both problems reduce to simple [[trigonometry]].\nOn a sphere, however, the solution is significantly more complex, because in the inverse problem the azimuths will differ between the two end points of the connecting [[great circle]], arc.\n\nOn the ellipsoid of revolution, geodesics may be written in terms of elliptic integrals, which are usually evaluated in terms of a series expansion\u2014see, for example, [[Vincenty's formulae]]. In the general case, the solution is called the [[geodesic]] for the surface considered. The [[differential equation]]s for the [[geodesic]] can be solved numerically.\n\n== Geodetic observational concepts ==\nHere we define some basic observational concepts, like angles and coordinates, defined in geodesy (and [[astronomy]] as well), mostly from the viewpoint of the local observer.\n\n* '''[[Plumbline]]''' or '''vertical''': the direction of local gravity, or the line that results by following it.\n* '''[[Zenith]]''': the point on the [[celestial sphere]] where the direction of the gravity vector in a point, extended upwards, intersects it. More correct is to call it a '''direction''' rather than a point.\n* '''[[Nadir]]''': the opposite point\u2014or rather, direction\u2014where the direction of gravity extended downward intersects the (invisible) celestial sphere.\n* '''Celestial horizon''': a plane perpendicular to a point's gravity vector.\n* '''[[Azimuth]]''': the direction angle within the plane of the horizon, typically counted clockwise from the north (in geodesy and astronomy) or south (in France).\n* '''[[Elevation]]''': the angular height of an object above the horizon, Alternatively [[zenith distance]], being equal to 90 degrees minus elevation.\n* '''Local topocentric coordinates''': azimuth (direction angle within the plane of the horizon), elevation angle (or zenith angle), distance.\n* '''North [[celestial pole]]''': the extension of the Earth's ([[precession|precessing]] and [[nutation|nutating]]) instantaneous spin axis extended northward to intersect the celestial sphere. (Similarly for the south celestial pole.)\n* '''Celestial equator''': the intersection of the (instantaneous) Earth equatorial plane with the celestial sphere.\n* '''[[meridian (geography)|Meridian]] plane''': any plane perpendicular to the celestial equator and containing the celestial poles.\n* '''Local meridian''': the plane containing the direction to the zenith and the direction to the celestial pole.\n\n== Geodetic measurements ==\n{{main|Satellite geodesy|Geodetic astronomy|Surveying|Gravimetry|Levelling}}\n\n[[File:Stephen Merkowitz NASA's Space Geodesy Project.ogv|thumb|350px|A NASA project manager talks about his work for the [[Space geodesy|Space Geodesy]] Project, including an overview of its four fundamental techniques: GPS, [[very-long-baseline interferometry|VLBI]], [[Satellite laser ranging|SLR]], and [[DORIS (geodesy)|DORIS]].]]\n\nThe level is used for determining height differences and height reference systems, commonly referred to [[mean sea level]]. The traditional [[spirit level]] produces these practically most useful heights above [[sea level]] directly; the more economical use of GPS instruments for height determination requires precise knowledge of the figure of the [[geoid]], as GPS only gives heights above the [[GRS80]] reference ellipsoid. As geoid knowledge accumulates, one may expect use of GPS heighting to spread.\n\nThe [[theodolite]] is used to measure horizontal and vertical angles to target points. These angles are referred to the local vertical. The [[tacheometer]] additionally determines, electronically or [[Electro-optics|electro-optically]], the distance to target, and is highly automated to even robotic in its operations. The method of [[free station position]] is widely used.\n\nFor local detail surveys, tacheometers are commonly employed although the old-fashioned rectangular technique using angle prism and steel tape is still an inexpensive alternative. Real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS techniques are used as well. Data collected are tagged and recorded digitally for entry into a [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) database.\n\nGeodetic [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers produce directly three-dimensional coordinates in a [[geocentric]] coordinate frame. Such a frame is, e.g., [[WGS84]], or the frames that are regularly produced and published by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service ([[IERS]]).\n\nGPS receivers have almost completely replaced terrestrial instruments for large-scale base network surveys. For planet-wide geodetic surveys, previously impossible, we can still mention [[satellite laser ranging]] (SLR) and [[lunar laser ranging]] (LLR) and [[very-long-baseline interferometry]] (VLBI) techniques. All these techniques also serve to monitor irregularities in the Earth's rotation as well as plate tectonic motions.\n\n[[Gravity]] is measured using [[gravimeters]], of which there are two kinds. First, \"absolute gravimeters\" are based on measuring the acceleration of [[free fall]] (e.g., of a reflecting prism in a [[vacuum tube]]). They are used to establish the vertical geospatial control and can be used in the field. Second, \"relative gravimeters\" are spring-based and are more common. They are used in gravity surveys over large areas for establishing the figure of the geoid over these areas. The most accurate relative gravimeters are called \"superconducting\" gravimeters, which are sensitive to one-thousandth of one-billionth of Earth surface gravity. Twenty-some superconducting gravimeters are used worldwide for studying Earth's [[tide]]s, [[rotation]], interior, and [[ocean]] and atmospheric loading, as well as for verifying the Newtonian constant of [[gravitation]].\n\nIn the future gravity, and altitude, will be measured by relativistic [[time dilation]] measured by [[Atomic clock#Strontium optical clocks|strontium optical clocks]].\n\n== Units and measures on the ellipsoid ==\nGeographical [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are stated in the units degree, minute of arc, and second of arc. They are ''angles'', not metric\nmeasures, and describe the ''direction'' of the local normal to the [[reference ellipsoid]] of revolution. This is ''approximately'' the same as the direction of the plumbline, i.e., local gravity, which is also the normal to the geoid surface. For this reason, astronomical position determination \u2013 measuring the direction of the plumbline by astronomical means \u2013 works fairly well provided an ellipsoidal model of the figure of the Earth is used.\n\nOne geographical mile, defined as one minute of arc on the equator, equals 1,855.32571922 m.  One [[nautical mile]] is one minute of astronomical latitude. The radius of curvature of the ellipsoid varies with latitude, being the longest at the pole and the shortest at the equator as is the nautical mile.\n\nA metre was originally defined as the 10-millionth part of the length from equator to North Pole along the meridian through Paris (the target was not quite reached in actual implementation, so that is off by 200 [[Parts-per notation#ppm|ppm]] in the current definitions). This means that one kilometre is roughly equal to (1/40,000) * 360 * 60 meridional minutes of arc, which equals 0.54 nautical mile, though this is not exact because the two units are defined on different bases (the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1,852 m, corresponding to a rounding of 1,000/0.54 m to four digits).\n\n== Temporal change ==\nIn geodesy, temporal change can be studied by a variety of techniques. Points on the Earth's surface change their location due to a variety of mechanisms:\n\n* Continental plate motion, [[plate tectonics]]\n* Episodic motion of tectonic origin, especially close to [[fault line]]s\n* Periodic effects due to tides\n* [[glaciation|Postglacial]] land uplift due to isostatic adjustment\n* Mass variations due to hydrological changes\n* Anthropogenic movements such as reservoir construction or [[petroleum]] or water extraction\n\nThe science of studying deformations and motions of the Earth's crust and the solid Earth as a whole is called [[geodynamics]]. Often, study of the Earth's irregular rotation is also included in its definition.\n\nTechniques for studying geodynamic phenomena on the global scale include:\n\n* Satellite positioning by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]\n* [[Very-long-baseline interferometry]] (VLBI)\n* Satellite and lunar [[laser ranging]]\n* Regionally and locally precise levelling\n* Precise tacheometers\n* Monitoring of gravity change\n* [[Interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] (InSAR) using satellite images\n\n== Notable geodesists ==\n\n=== Mathematical geodesists before 1900 ===\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Pythagoras]] 580\u2013490&nbsp;BC, [[ancient Greece]]<ref>[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/Geodesy4Layman/TR80003A.HTM DEFENSE MAPPING AGENCY TECHNICAL REPORT 80-003]</ref>\n* [[Eratosthenes]] 276\u2013194&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Hipparchus]] {{circa}} 190\u2013120&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Posidonius]] {{circa}} 135\u201351&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Claudius Ptolemy]] {{circa}} AD&nbsp;83\u2013168, [[Roman Empire]] ([[Roman Egypt]])\n* [[Al-Ma'mun]] 786\u2013833, [[Baghdad]] (Iraq/[[Mesopotamia]])\n* [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] 973\u20131048, [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] ([[Persia|Iran]]/[[Samanid Dynasty]])\n* [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] 1100\u20131166, ([[Arabia]] & Sicily)\n* [[Regiomontanus]] 1436\u20131476, (Germany/Austria)\n* [[Abel Foullon]] 1513\u20131563 or 1565, (France)\n* [[Pedro Nunes]] 1502\u20131578 (Portugal)\n* [[Gerardus Mercator|Gerhard Mercator]] 1512\u20131594 (Belgium & Germany)\n* [[Willebrord Snellius|Snellius]] (Willebrord Snel van Royen) 1580\u20131626, [[Leiden]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Christiaan Huygens]] 1629\u20131695 (Netherlands)\n* [[Pierre Bouguer]] 1698\u20131758, (France & Peru)\n* [[Pierre de Maupertuis]] 1698\u20131759 (France)\n* [[Alexis Clairaut]] 1713\u20131765 (France)\n* [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] 1728\u20131777 (France)\n* [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]] 1711\u20131787, ([[Rome]]/ [[Berlin]]/ [[Paris]])\n* [[Ino Tadataka]] 1745\u20131818, ([[Tokyo]])\n* [[Georg von Reichenbach]] 1771\u20131826, [[Bavaria]] (Germany)\n* [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] 1749\u20131827, [[Paris]] (France)\n* [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Adrien Marie Legendre]] 1752\u20131833, [[Paris]] (France)\n* [[Johann Georg von Soldner]] 1776\u20131833, [[Munich]] (Germany)\n* [[George Everest]] 1790\u20131866 (England and India)\n* [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] 1784\u20131846, [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (Germany)\n* [[Heinrich Christian Schumacher]] 1780\u20131850 (Germany & Estonia)\n* [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] 1777\u20131855, G\u00f6ttingen (Germany)\n* [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]] 1793\u20131864, [[Tartu Observatory|Dorpat]] and [[Pulkovo Observatory|Pulkovo]] ([[Russian Empire]])\n* [[J.

Euro-style games emphasize strategy while downplaying luck and conflict. They tend to have economic themes rather than military and usually keep all the players in the game until it ends.\n\nEurogames are sometimes contrasted with [[American-style board game]]s, which generally involve more luck, conflict, and drama.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12009728 \"German recreation: An affinity for rules?\"] ''The Economist'', August 28, 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/german-board-games-catan/550826/ |title=The Invasion of the German Board Games |author=[[Jonathan Kay]] |date=January 21, 2018 |website=[[The Atlantic]] |access-date=January 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nEurogames are usually less [[abstract strategy game|abstract]] than [[chess]] or [[go (board game)|Go]], but more abstract than [[wargaming|wargames]]. Likewise, they generally require more thought and planning than [[party game]]s such as ''[[Pictionary]]'' or ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]''.\n\n== Definition and variations ==\n'''Eurogame''' is a common, though still an imprecise, label. Because most of these games feature the name of the designer prominently on the box, they are sometimes known as '''designer games'''.<ref name=\"designergames\">{{cite web|url=http://www.discovergames.com/bschwartz.htm|title=One Retailer's Perspective|author=Bob Schwartz}}</ref> Other names include '''German Style Boardgame''', '''family strategy game''' and '''hobby game'''.

The [[3M_bookshelf_game_series | 3M series]] of which ''Acquire'' formed a part became popular in Germany, and became a template for a new form of game, one in which direct conflict or warfare did not play a role, due in part to aversion in postwar Germany to products which glorified conflict.<ref name=\"Eurogames\">{{cite book | title= Eurogames: The Design, Culture and Play of Modern European Board Games | last= Woods | first= Stuart | year= 2009 | publisher= [[McFarland & Company|McFarland]] | isbn= 0786467975}}</ref><ref name=\"It's All a Game\">{{cite book | title= It's All a Game: The History of Board Games from Monopoly to Settlers of Catan | last= Donovan | first= Tristan | year= 2017 | publisher= [[Thomas Dunne Books]] | isbn= 1250082722}}</ref> The genre developed as a more concentrated design movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Germany, and {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} Germany purchased more board games ''per capita'' than any other country.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web|url= http://archive.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/magazine/17-04/mf_settlers?currentPage=all |title= Monopoly Killer: Perfect German Board Game Redefines Genre |last1= Curry |first1= Andrew |date= 23 March 2009 |website= archive.wired.com |access-date= 27 May 2015}}</ref>  The phenomenon has spread to other European countries such as France, the Netherlands, and Sweden.{{citation needed|date= July 2012}}  While many games are published and played in other markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, they occupy a niche status there.<ref name=\"wired\" />\n\n''[[Catan|The Settlers of Catan]]'', first published in 1995, paved the way for the genre outside Europe.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/1aab09a4-8fb2-11df-8df0-00144feab49a.html \n|title= Why we still love board games \n|last1= Harford |first1= Tim \n|date= 17 July 2010 |website= ft.com \n|publisher= FT Magazine \n|access-date= 27 May 2015\n}}\n</ref>\nThough neither the first eurogame nor the first such game to find an audience outside Germany, it became much more popular than any of its predecessors. It quickly sold millions of copies in Germany, and in the process brought money and attention to the genre as a whole. Other games in the genre to achieve widespread popularity include ''[[Carcassonne (board game)|Carcassonne]]'', ''[[Puerto Rico (board game) | Puerto Rico]]'', ''[[Ticket to Ride (board game)| Ticket to Ride]]'', and ''[[Alhambra (board game) |Alhambra]]''.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nEurogames are usually multiplayer and can be learned easily and played in a relatively short time, perhaps multiple times in a single session. A certain amount of socializing might typically be expected during game play, as opposed to the relative silence sometimes expected during some [[strategy games]] like [[chess]] and [[go (board game)|go]] or restrictions on allowable conversations or actions found in some highly competitive games such as [[contract bridge]].\n\nEurogames also differ from abstract strategy games like chess by using themes tied to specific locales, and emphasize individual development and comparative achievement rather than direct conflict.<ref name=\"Eurogames\"/> Eurogames also emphasize the mechanical challenges of their systems over having the systems match the theme of the game. They are generally simpler than the [[wargaming|wargames]] that flourished in the 1970s and 1980s from publishers such as [[Simulations Publications|SPI]] and [[Avalon Hill]], but nonetheless often have a considerable depth of play, especially in some \"gamers' games\" such as [[Tigris and Euphrates]] and [[Caylus (game)|Caylus]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nOne consequence of the increasing popularity of this genre has been an expansion upwards in complexity. Games such as Puerto Rico that were considered quite complex when Eurogames proliferated in the U.S. after the turn of the millennium are now the norm, with newer high-end titles like [[Terra Mystica]] and [[Tzolkin]] being significantly more difficult to master.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n=== Themes ===\nEurogames tend to have a theme (role-play element or a background story)\u2014more like ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' or ''[[Clue (game)|Clue]]'', rather than [[poker]] or [[Tic Tac Toe]]. Game mechanics are not restricted by the theme, however; unlike a simulation game, the theme of a Eurogame is often merely mnemonic. It is somewhat common for a game to be designed with one theme and published with another, or for the same game to be given a significantly different theme for a later republication, or for two games on wildly different themes to have very similar mechanics. Combat themes are uncommon, and player conflict is often indirect (for example, competing for a scarce resource).\n\nExample themes are:\n* Carcassonne \u2013 build a medieval landscape complete with walled cities, monasteries, roads, and fields.\n* Puerto Rico \u2013 develop a plantation on the island of [[Puerto Rico]], set in the 18th century.\n* [[Imperial (board game)|Imperial]] \u2013 as an international investor, influence the politics of pre-[[World War I]] European empires.\n* Bruxelles 1893 \u2013 take the role of an Art Nouveau architect during the late 19th century and try to become the most famous architect in Belgium.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.euroboardgameblog.com/reviews/bruxelles-1893-board-game-review/ | title= Bruxelles 1893 Review \u2013 An Art Nouveau & Architecture Board Game}}</ref>\n\n=== Games made for everyone ===\n[[File:Playing Settlers of Catan.jpg|thumb|A group playing ''Settlers of Catan'']]\nWhile many titles (especially the strategically heavier ones) are enthusiastically played by gamers as a hobby, Eurogames are, for the most part, well suited to social play.  In keeping with this social function, various characteristics of the games tend to support that aspect well, and these have become quite common across the genre. For example, generally Eurogames do not have a fixed number of players like chess or bridge; though there is a sizable body of German-style games that are designed for exactly two players, most games can accommodate anywhere from two to six players (with varying degrees of suitability). Six-player games are somewhat rare, or require expansions, as with The Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne. Usually each player plays for him- or herself, rather than in a partnership or team.\n\nPlaying time varies from a half-hour to a few hours, with one to two hours being typical. In contrast to games such as [[Risk (game)|Risk]] or Monopoly, in which a close game can extend indefinitely, Eurogames usually have a mechanism to stop the game within its stated playing time. Common mechanisms include a pre-determined winning score, a set number of game turns, or depletion of limited game resources.  For example, [[Ra (board game)|Ra]] and Carcassonne have limited tiles to exhaust.\n\n=== Low randomness ===\n\nEurogame designs tend to de-emphasize luck and random elements.<ref name=\"San Diego Reader\">{{cite web | url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/sep/13/hipster-abandoning-screen-cardboard/# | title= Abandoning the screen for cardboard| last= Stevens | first= DJ | date=2017-09-13}}</ref> Often, the only random element of the game will be resource or terrain distribution in the initial setup, or (less frequently) the random order of a set of event or objective cards. The role played by deliberately random mechanics in other styles of game is instead fulfilled by the unpredictability of the behavior of other players.\n\n=== No player elimination ===\nAnother prominent characteristic of these games is the lack of player elimination.  Eliminating players before the end of the game is seen as contrary to the social aspect of such games.  Most of these games are designed to keep all players in the game as long as possible, so it is rare to be certain of victory or defeat until relatively late in the game.\n\nRelated to no-player-elimination is that Eurogame scoring systems are often designed so that hidden scoring or end-of-game bonuses can catapult a player who appears to be in a lagging position at end of play into the lead.  A second-order consequence is that Eurogames tend to have multiple paths to victory (dependent on aiming at different end-of-game bonuses) and it is often not obvious to other players which strategic path a player is pursuing.\n\nBalancing mechanisms are often integrated into the rules, giving slight advantages to lagging players and slight hindrances to the leaders.  This helps to keep the game competitive to the very end.\n\n=== International audience ===\nThese games are designed for international audiences, so they are not [[word game]]s and usually do not contain much text outside of the rules.  Game components often use symbols and icons instead of words, reducing the amount of text to be translated between localized editions. Gameplay also tends to de-emphasize or entirely exclude [[verbal communication]] as a game element, with many games being fully playable if all players know the rules, even if they do not speak a common language.\n\nSome publishers design games that contain instructions and game elements in more than one language, e.g. the game [[Ursuppe]] comes with rules and cards in both German and English; [[Khronos (game)|Khronos]] features instructions in French, English, and German, and a Swiss game, [[Enchanted Owls]], provides [[Languages of Switzerland|French, German, Italian, and Romansh]] rules. However, this is usually not the case if the rights to sell the game outside its country of origin are sold to another publisher.\n\nEnglish editions are often available, either published in the US or co-published by a German company cooperating with a US company, or the reverse (example: [[Dominion (game)|Dominion]]).\n\n=== Game mechanics ===\n[[File:Samurai board game.jpg|thumb|''[[Samurai (board game)|Samurai]]'' is a game of tile placement, set collection and area control]]\nA wide variety of often innovative mechanisms or mechanics are used, and familiar mechanics like rolling dice and moving, capture, or trick taking are avoided. If a game has a board, the board is usually irregular rather than uniform or symmetric (like Risk rather than chess or [[Scrabble]]); the board is often random (like The Settlers of Catan) or has random elements (like [[Tikal (board game)|Tikal]]). Some boards are merely mnemonic or organizational and contribute only to ease of play, like a [[cribbage]] board; examples of this include Puerto Rico and [[Princes of Florence]]. Random elements are often present, but do not usually dominate the game. While rules are light to moderate, they allow depth of play, usually requiring thought, planning, and a shift of tactics through the game and often with a chess- or backgammon-like [[chess opening|opening game]], [[middle game]], and [[Chess endgame|end game]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nStuart Woods' ''Eurogames'' cites six examples of mechanics common to eurogames:<ref name=\"Eurogames\"/>\n\n*'''Tile Placement'''&nbsp;\u2013 spatial placement of game components on the playing board.\n*'''Auctions'''&nbsp;\u2013 includes open and hidden auctions of both resources and actions from other players and the game system itself.\n*'''Trading/Negotiation'''&nbsp;\u2013 not simply trading resources of equivalent values, but allowing players to set markets.\n*'''Set Collection'''&nbsp;\u2013 collecting games resources in specific groups that are then cashed in for points or other currency.\n*'''Area Control'''&nbsp;\u2013 also known as area majority or influence, this involves controlling a game element or board space through allocation of resources.\n*'''Worker Placement or Role Selection'''&nbsp;\u2013 players choose specific game actions in sequential order, with players disallowed from choosing a previously selected action.\n\n=== Game designer as author ===\nAlthough not relevant to actual play, the name of the game's designer is often prominently mentioned on the box, or at least in the rule book. Top designers enjoy considerable following among enthusiasts of Eurogames. For this reason, the name \"designer games\" is often offered as a description of the genre.<ref name=\"designergames\"/> Recently, there has also been a wave of games designed as spin-offs of popular novels, such as the games taking their style from the German bestsellers [[The Swarm (Sch\u00e4tzing novel)|Der Schwarm]] and [[Inkheart trilogy|Tintenherz]].\n\n== Industry ==\n\n=== Designers ===\n[[File:Kniziabrunnhofer.jpg|framed|Reiner Knizia and Bernd Brunnhofer at the [[Deutscher Spiele Preis]] awards at [[Spiel]] 2003 in [[Essen, Germany]]]]\nDesigners of Eurogames include:\n* [[Antoine Bauza]] is a prolific French designer, best known for his work on [[7 Wonders (board game)|7 Wonders]].\n* [[Vladim\u00edr Chv\u00e1til|Vlaada Chv\u00e1til]] is a Czech designer of board games and video games, whose games include [[Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization]], [[Galaxy Trucker]], and [[Space Alert]].

He has also designed many card games such as [[Lost Cities]], [[Schotten-Totten]], and [[Blue Moon (game)|Blue Moon]], and the [[cooperative board game]] [[Lord of the Rings (board game)|The Lord of the Rings]].\n* [[Wolfgang Kramer]] often works with other game designers. Some of his best-known titles include [[El Grande]], [[Tikal (board game)|Tikal]], [[Princes of Florence]], and [[Torres (board game)|Torres]]. His games often have some sort of action point system, and include some geometric element.\n* [[Alan R. Moon]] is a British-born designer with numerous games to his credit, often with a railway theme, including the Spiel des Jahres winning Ticket to Ride and [[Elfenland]].

Often German producers will try to establish a line of similar games, such as [[Kosmos (game publisher)|Kosmos]]'s two-player card game series or [[Alea (game publisher)|Alea]]'s big box line.\n\nThe rights to sell the game in English are often sold to separate companies. Some try to change the game as little as possible, such as [[Rio Grande Games]]. Others, including [[Mayfair Games]], substantially change the visual design of the game, and sometimes the rules as well.\n\n=== Events ===\nThe [[Spiel|Internationale Spieltage]], also known as Essen Spiel, or the Essen Games Fair, is the largest non-digital game convention in the world,<ref name=\"Eurogames\"/><ref name=\"Daily Maverick\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-08-21-board-games-are-quietly-nerdily-becoming-big-business/#.WbXZV7pFy1s|title=Board games are quietly, nerdily, becoming big business|author=Seemy Peerutin}}</ref> and the place where the largest number of eurogames are released each year.

This unified interaction is characterized by one larger [[gauge theory|gauge symmetry]] and thus several force carriers, but one unified [[coupling constant]]. If Grand Unification is realized in nature, there is the possibility of a [[grand unification epoch]] in the early universe in which the fundamental forces are not yet distinct.\n\nModels that do not unify all interactions using one [[simple group]] as the gauge symmetry, but do so using [[semisimple group]]s, can exhibit similar properties and are sometimes referred to as Grand Unified Theories as well.\n\nUnifying [[gravity]] with the other three interactions would provide a [[theory of everything]] (TOE), rather than a GUT. Nevertheless, GUTs are often seen as an intermediate step towards a TOE.\n\nThe novel particles predicted by GUT models are expected to have masses around the [[GUT scale]]{{clarify|date=March 2016}}\u2014just a few orders of magnitude below the [[Planck scale]]\u2014and so will be well beyond the reach of any foreseen particle collider experiments. Therefore, the particles predicted by GUT models will be unable to be observed directly and instead the effects of grand unification might be detected through indirect observations such as [[proton decay]], electric dipole moments of elementary particles, or the properties of [[neutrino]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ross |first=G. |date=1984 |title=Grand Unified Theories |pages= |publisher=[[Westview Press]] |isbn=978-0-8053-6968-7}}</ref> Some GUTs, such as the [[Pati-Salam model]], predict the existence of [[magnetic monopoles]].\n\nGUT models which aim to be completely realistic are quite complicated, even compared to the Standard Model, because they need to introduce additional fields and interactions, or even additional dimensions of space. The main reason for this complexity lies in the difficulty of reproducing the observed fermion masses and mixing angles which may be related to an existence of some additional [[family symmetries]] beyond the conventional GUT models. Due to this difficulty, and due to the lack of any observed effect of grand unification so far, there is no generally accepted GUT model.\n\n{{unsolved|physics|Are the three forces of the Standard Model unified at high energies?

While the description of [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] interactions within the Standard Model is based on [[gauge theory|gauge symmetries]] governed by the [[simple Lie group|simple symmetry groups]] {{math|[[SU(3)]]}} and {{math|[[SU(2)]]}} which allow only discrete charges, the remaining component, the [[weak hypercharge]] interaction is described by an [[Abelian Group|abelian symmetry]] {{math|[[U(1)]]}} which in principle allows for arbitrary charge assignments.<ref group=note>There are however certain constraints on the choice of particle charges from theoretical consistency, in particular [[gauge anomaly|anomaly cancellation]].</ref> The observed [[charge quantization]], namely the fact that all known [[elementary particle]]s carry electric charges which appear to be exact multiples of \u2153 of the [[elementary charge|\"elementary\" charge]], has led to the idea that [[hypercharge]] interactions and possibly the strong and weak interactions might be embedded in one Grand Unified interaction described by a single, larger simple symmetry group containing the Standard Model. This would automatically predict the quantized nature and values of all elementary particle charges. Since this also results in a prediction for the relative strengths of the [[fundamental interaction]]s which we observe, in particular the [[weak mixing angle]], Grand Unification ideally reduces the number of independent input parameters, but is also constrained by observations.\n\nGrand Unification is reminiscent of the unification of electric and magnetic forces by [[Maxwell equations|Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]] in the 19th century, but its physical implications and mathematical structure are qualitatively different.\n\n==Unification of matter particles==\n{{For|an elementary introduction to how Lie algebras are related to particle physics|Particle physics and representation theory}}\n[[File:SU(5) representation of fermions.png|thumb|Schematic representation of fermions and bosons in {{math|SU(5)}} GUT showing {{math|'''5''' + '''10'''}} split in the multiplets.

In addition to [[Standard Model]] particles, the theory includes twelve colored X bosons, responsible for [[proton decay]].]]\n\n{{math|SU(5)}} is the simplest GUT. The smallest [[simple Lie group]] which contains the [[standard model]], and upon which the first Grand Unified Theory was based, is\n\n:<math> SU(5) \\supset SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)</math>.\n\nSuch group symmetries allow the reinterpretation of several known particles{{which|date=March 2016}} as different states of a single particle field. However, it is not obvious that the simplest possible choices for the extended \"Grand Unified\" symmetry should yield the correct inventory of elementary particles. The fact that all currently known matter particles fit nicely into three copies of the smallest [[group representation]]s of {{math|SU(5)}} and immediately carry the correct observed charges, is one of the first and most important reasons why people believe that a Grand Unified Theory might actually be realized in nature.\n\nThe two smallest [[group representation#Reducibility|irreducible representations]] of {{math|SU(5)}} are {{math|'''5'''}}{{clarify|date=March 2016}} and {{math|'''10'''}}. In the standard assignment, the {{math|'''5'''}} contains the [[Charge Conjugation|charge conjugates]] of the right-handed [[Quark|down-type quark]] [[Quantum chromodynamics|color]] [[Triplet state|triplet]] and a left-handed [[lepton]] [[isospin]] [[Doublet state|doublet]], while the {{math|'''10'''}} contains the six [[Quark|up-type quark]] components, the left-handed [[Quark|down-type quark]] [[Quantum chromodynamics|color]] triplet, and the right-handed [[electron]]. This scheme has to be replicated for each of the three known [[Generation (particle physics)|generations of matter]]. It is notable that the theory is [[Gauge anomaly|anomaly free]] with this matter content.\n\nThe hypothetical [[neutrino#Chirality|right-handed neutrinos]] are a singlet of {{math|SU(5)}}, which means its mass is not forbidden by any symmetry; it doesn't need a spontaneous symmetry breaking which explains why its mass would be heavy.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} (see [[seesaw mechanism]]).\n\n===SO(10)===\n{{main article|SO(10) (physics)}}\n\n[[File:E6GUT.svg|200px|right|thumb|The pattern of [[weak isospin]], W, weaker isospin, W', strong g3 and g8, and baryon minus lepton, B, charges for particles in the [[SO(10)]] Grand Unified Theory, rotated to show the embedding in [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]].]]\n\nThe next simple Lie group which contains the standard model is\n\n:<math>SO(10)\\supset SU(5)\\supset SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)</math>.\n\nHere, the unification of matter is even more complete, since the [[group representation|irreducible]] [[spinor]] [[group representation|representation]] {{math|'''16'''}} contains both the {{math|{{overline|'''5'''}}}} and {{math|'''10'''}} of {{math|SU(5)}} and a right-handed neutrino, and thus the complete particle content of one generation of the extended [[standard model]] with [[Neutrino|neutrino masses]]. This is already the largest [[Simple Lie group|simple group]] which achieves the unification of matter in a scheme involving only the already known matter particles (apart from the [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs sector]]).\n\nSince different standard model fermions are grouped together in larger representations, GUTs specifically predict relations among the fermion masses, such as between the [[electron]] and the [[down quark]], the [[muon]] and the [[strange quark]], and the [[tau lepton]] and the [[bottom quark]] for {{math|SU(5)}} and {{math|SO(10)}}. Some of these mass relations hold approximately, but most don't (see [[Georgi-Jarlskog mass relation]]).\n\nThe boson matrix for {{math|SO(10)}} is found by taking the {{math|15 \u00d7 15}} matrix from the {{math|'''10''' + '''5'''}} representation of {{math|SU(5)}} and adding an extra row and column for the right-handed neutrino. The bosons are found by adding a partner to each of the 20 charged bosons (2 right-handed W bosons, 6 massive charged gluons and 12 X/Y type bosons) and adding an extra heavy neutral Z-boson to make 5 neutral bosons in total. The boson matrix will have a boson or its new partner in each row and column. These pairs combine to create the familiar 16D Dirac [[spinor]] matrices of {{math|SO(10)}}.\n\n===Extended Grand Unified Theories===\nNon-chiral extensions of the Standard Model with vectorlike split-multiplet particle spectra which naturally appear in the higher SU(N) GUTs considerably modify the desert physics and lead to the realistic (string-scale) grand unification for conventional three quark-lepton families even without using [[supersymmetry]] (see below). On the other hand, due to a new missing VEV mechanism emerging in the supersymmetric SU(8) GUT the simultaneous solution to the gauge hierarchy (doublet-triplet splitting) problem and problem of unification of flavor can be found.<ref>J.L.Chkareuli, SU(N) SUSY GUTS WITH STRING REMNANTS: MINIMAL SU(5) AND BEYOND, Invited Talk given at 29th International Conference on High-Energy Physics (ICHEP 98), Vancouver, 23\u201329 July 1998. In *Vancouver 1998, High energy physics, vol. 2 1669\u201373</ref>\n\n'''GUTs with four families / generations, SU(8)''': Assuming 4 generations of fermions instead of 3 makes a total of {{math|'''64'''}} types of particles. These can be put into {{math|'''64''' {{=}} '''8''' + '''56'''}} representations of {{math|SU(8)}}. This can be divided into {{math|SU(5) \u00d7 SU(3)<sub>F</sub> \u00d7 U(1)}} which is the {{math|SU(5)}} theory together with some heavy bosons which act on the generation number.\n\n'''GUTs with four families / generations, O(16)''': Again assuming 4 generations of fermions, the '''128''' particles and anti-particles can be put into a single spinor representation of {{math|O(16)}}.\n\n===Symplectic groups and quaternion representations===\nSymplectic gauge groups could also be considered. For example, {{math|Sp(8)}} (which is called {{math|Sp(4)}} in the article [[symplectic group]]) has a representation in terms of {{math|4 \u00d7 4}} quaternion unitary matrices which has a {{math|'''16'''}} dimensional real representation and so might be considered as a candidate for a gauge group. {{math|Sp(8)}} has 32 charged bosons and 4 neutral bosons. Its subgroups include {{math|SU(4)}} so can at least contain the gluons and photon of {{math|SU(3) \u00d7 U(1)}}. Although it's probably not possible to have weak bosons acting on chiral fermions in this representation. A quaternion representation of the fermions might be:\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\ne+i\\overline{e}+jv+k\\overline{v} \\\\\nu_r+i\\overline{u_r}+jd_r+k\\overline{d_r} \\\\\nu_g+i\\overline{u_g}+jd_g+k\\overline{d_g} \\\\\nu_b+i\\overline{u_b}+jd_b+k\\overline{d_b} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}_L </math>\n\nA further complication with [[quaternion]] representations of fermions is that there are two types of multiplication: left multiplication and right multiplication which must be taken into account. It turns out that including left and right-handed {{math|4 \u00d7 4}} quaternion matrices is equivalent to including a single right-multiplication by a unit quaternion which adds an extra SU(2) and so has an extra neutral boson and two more charged bosons. Thus the group of left- and right-handed {{math|4 \u00d7 4}} quaternion matrcies is {{math|Sp(8) \u00d7 SU(2)}} which does include the standard model bosons:\n\n:<math> SU(4,H)_L\\times H_R = Sp(8)\\times SU(2) \\supset SU(4)\\times SU(2) \\supset SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1) </math>\n\nIf <math>\\psi</math> is a quaternion valued spinor, <math>A^{ab}_\\mu</math> is quaternion hermitian {{math|4 \u00d7 4}} matrix coming from {{math|Sp(8)}} and <math>B_\\mu</math> is a pure imaginary quaternion (both of which are 4-vector bosons) then the interaction term is:\n\n::<math>\\overline{\\psi^{a}} \\gamma_\\mu\\left( A^{ab}_\\mu\\psi^b + \\psi^a B_\\mu \\right) </math>\n\n===Octonion representations===\nIt can be noted that a generation of 16 fermions can be put into the form of an [[octonion]] with each element of the octonion being an 8-vector. If the 3 generations are then put in a 3x3 hermitian matrix with certain additions for the diagonal elements then these matrices form an exceptional (Grassmann-) [[Jordan algebra]], which has the symmetry group of one of the exceptional Lie groups (F<sub>4</sub>, E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub> or E<sub>8</sub>) depending on the details.\n\n:<math>\\psi=\\begin{bmatrix}\na & e & \\mu \\\\\n\\overline{e} & b & \\tau \\\\\n\\overline{\\mu} & \\overline{\\tau} & c\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\n:<math>[\\psi_A,\\psi_B] \\subset J_3(O)</math>\n\nBecause they are fermions the anti-commutators of the Jordan algebra become commutators. It is known that E<sub>6</sub> has subgroup {{math|O(10)}} and so is big enough to include the Standard Model. An E<sub>8</sub> gauge group, for example, would have 8 neutral bosons, 120 charged bosons and 120 charged anti-bosons. To account for the 248 fermions in the lowest multiplet of E<sub>8</sub>, these would either have to include anti-particles (and so have [[baryogenesis]]), have new undiscovered particles, or have gravity-like ([[spin connection]]) bosons affecting elements of the particles spin direction. Each of these possess theoretical problems.\n\n===Beyond Lie groups===\nOther structures have been suggested including [[Lie 3-algebra]]s and [[Lie superalgebra]]s. Neither of these fit with [[Yang\u2013Mills theory]]. In particular Lie superalgebras would introduce bosons with the wrong{{clarify|date=January 2016}} statistics. [[Supersymmetry]] however does fit with Yang\u2013Mills. For example, N=4 Super Yang Mills Theory requires an {{math|SU(''N'')}} gauge group{{clarify|date=January 2016}}.\n\n==Unification of forces and the role of supersymmetry==\nThe unification of forces is possible due to the energy scale dependence of force [[coupling constant|coupling parameters]] in [[quantum field theory]] called [[renormalization group|renormalization group running]], which allows parameters with vastly different values at usual energies to converge to a single value at a much higher energy scale.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross |first=G. |date=1984 |title=Grand Unified Theories |pages= |publisher=[[Westview Press]] |isbn=978-0-8053-6968-7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[renormalization group]] running of the three gauge couplings in the [[Standard Model]] has been found to nearly, but not quite, meet at the same point if the [[hypercharge]] is normalized so that it is consistent with {{math|SU(5)}} or {{math|SO(10)}} GUTs, which are precisely the GUT groups which lead to a simple fermion unification. This is a significant result, as other Lie groups lead to different normalizations. However, if the [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] extension [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|MSSM]] is used instead of the Standard Model, the match becomes much more accurate. In this case, the coupling constants of the strong and electroweak interactions meet at the [[grand unification energy]], also known as the GUT scale:\n\n:<math>\\Lambda_{\\text{GUT}} \\approx 10^{16}\\,\\text{GeV}</math>.\n\nIt is commonly believed that this matching is unlikely to be a coincidence, and is often quoted as one of the main motivations to further investigate [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric theories]] despite the fact that no supersymmetric partner particles have been experimentally observed. Also, most model builders simply assume [[supersymmetry]] because it solves the [[hierarchy problem]]\u2014i.e., it stabilizes the electroweak [[MSSM Higgs Mass|Higgs mass]] against [[Renormalization|radiative correction]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Neutrino masses==\nSince [[Majorana fermion|Majorana]] masses of the right-handed neutrino are forbidden by {{math|SO(10)}} symmetry, {{math|SO(10)}} GUTs predict the Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos to be close to the [[GUT scale]] where the symmetry is [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] in those models. In [[Supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] GUTs, this scale tends to be larger than would be desirable to obtain realistic masses of the light, mostly left-handed neutrinos (see [[neutrino oscillation]]) via the [[seesaw mechanism]].\n\n==Proposed theories==\nSeveral theories have been proposed, but none is currently universally accepted. An even more ambitious theory that includes ''all'' [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]], including [[gravitation]], is termed a [[theory of everything]]. Some common [[mainstream]] GUT models are:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* minimal [[left-right model]] \u2014 {{math|SU(3)<sub>C</sub> \u00d7 SU(2)<sub>L</sub> \u00d7 SU(2)<sub>R</sub> \u00d7 U(1)<sub>B-L</sub>}}\n* [[Georgi\u2013Glashow model]] \u2014 {{math|SU(5)}}\n* [[SO(10) (physics)|SO(10)]]\n* [[Flipped SU(5)|Flipped {{math|SU(5)}}]] \u2014 {{math|SU(5) \u00d7 U(1)}}\n* [[Pati\u2013Salam model]] \u2014 {{math|SU(4) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)}}\n* [[flipped SO(10)|Flipped {{math|SO(10)}}]] \u2014 {{math|SO(10) \u00d7 U(1)}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Trinification]] \u2014 {{math|SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3)}}\n* [[SU(6) (physics)|{{math|SU(6)}}]]\n* [[E6 (mathematics)|{{math|E<sub>6</sub>}}]]\n* [[331 model]]\n* [[chiral color]]\n\n{{col-end}}\nNot quite GUTs:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Technicolor (physics)|Technicolor models]]\n* [[Little Higgs]]\n* [[String theory]]\n* [[Causal fermion system]]s\n{{col-break}}\n* [[M-theory]]\n* [[Preon]]s\n* [[Loop quantum gravity]]\n* [[Causal dynamical triangulation| Causal dynamical triangulation theory]]\n{{col-end}}\n''Note'': These models refer to [[Lie algebra]]s not to [[Lie group]]s.

A number of other GUT models are based upon subgroups of {{math|SO(10)}}. They are the minimal [[left-right model]], {{math|[[SU(5)]]}}, [[flipped SU(5)|flipped {{math|SU(5)}}]] and the [[Pati\u2013Salam model]]. The GUT group E<sub>6</sub> contains {{math|SO(10)}}, but models based upon it are significantly more complicated. The primary reason for studying E<sub>6</sub> models comes from {{math|E<sub>8</sub> \u00d7 E<sub>8</sub>}} [[heterotic string theory]].\n\nGUT models generically predict the existence of [[topological defect]]s such as [[magnetic monopoles|monopoles]], [[cosmic strings]], [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]]s, and others. But none have been observed. Their absence is known as the [[monopole problem]] in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Many GUT models also predict [[proton decay]], although not the Pati\u2013Salam model; proton decay has never been observed by experiments. The minimal experimental limit on the proton's lifetime pretty much rules out minimal {{math|SU(5)}} and heavily constrains the other models. The lack of detected supersymmetry to date also constrains many models.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Proton Decay.

These theories predict that for each electroweak Higgs doublet, there is a corresponding [[color charge|colored]] Higgs triplet field with a very small mass (many orders of magnitude smaller than the GUT scale here). In theory, unifying [[quark]]s with [[lepton]]s, the Higgs doublet would also be unified with a Higgs triplet. Such triplets have not been observed. They would also cause extremely rapid proton decay (far below current experimental limits) and prevent the gauge coupling strengths from running together in the renormalization group.\n\nMost GUT models require a threefold replication of the matter fields. As such, they do not explain why there are three generations of fermions. Most GUT models also fail to explain the [[little hierarchy]] between the fermion masses for different generations.\n\n==Ingredients==\nA GUT model consists of a [[gauge group]] which is a [[compact Lie group]], a [[connection form]] for that Lie group, a [[Yang\u2013Mills action]] for that connection given by an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] [[symmetric bilinear form]] over its Lie algebra (which is specified by a [[coupling constant]] for each factor), a [[Higgs sector]] consisting of a number of scalar fields taking on values within real/complex [[representations of Lie groups|representations]] of the Lie group and chiral [[Weyl fermion]]s taking on values within a complex rep of the Lie group. The Lie group contains the [[Standard Model group]] and the Higgs fields acquire [[VEV]]s leading to a [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] to the [[Standard Model]]. The Weyl fermions represent matter.\n\n==Current status==\nThere is currently no hard evidence that nature is described by a Grand Unified Theory. The discovery of [[neutrino oscillation]]s indicates that the Standard Model is incomplete and has led to renewed interest toward certain GUT such as {{math|SO(10)}}. One of the few possible experimental tests of certain GUT is [[proton decay]] and also fermion masses. There are a few more special tests for supersymmetric GUT. However, minimum proton lifetimes from research (at or exceeding the 10<sup>34</sup>-10<sup>35</sup> year range) have ruled out simpler GUTs and most non-SUSY models. The maximum upper limit on proton lifetime (if unstable), is calculated at 6 x 10<sup>39</sup> years for SUSY models and 1.4 x 10<sup>36</sup> years for minimal non-SUSY GUTs.<ref>Pran Nath and Pavel Fileviez Perez, \"Proton Stability\nin Grand Unified Theories, in Strings and in Branes\", Appendix H; 23 April 2007.  arXiv:hep-ph/0601023  https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0601023</ref>\n\nThe [[gauge coupling]] strengths of [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]], the [[weak interaction]] and [[hypercharge]] seem to meet at a common length scale called the [[Grand unification energy|GUT scale]] and equal approximately to 10<sup>16</sup> GeV (slightly less than the [[Planck energy]] of 10<sup>19</sup> GeV), which is somewhat suggestive. This interesting numerical observation is called the '''gauge coupling unification''', and it works particularly well if one assumes the existence of [[superpartner]]s of the Standard Model particles. Still it is possible to achieve the same by postulating, for instance, that ordinary (non supersymmetric) {{math|SO(10)}} models break with an intermediate gauge scale, such as the one of Pati\u2013Salam group.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n*[[Paradigm shift]]\n*[[Classical unified field theories]]\n*[[X and Y bosons]]\n*[[B \u2212 L]] quantum number\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Stephen Hawking]], [[A Brief History of Time]], includes a brief popular overview.\n* [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Grand_unification Grand unification] Paul Langacker [[Scholarpedia]] 7(10):11419.\t{{doi|10.4249/scholarpedia.11419}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20180829120432/http://math.ucr.edu/~huerta/oral.pdf The Algebra of Grand Unified Theories]\n\n{{Standard model of physics}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Physical cosmology]]\n[[Category:Physics beyond the Standard Model]]\n[[Category:Grand Unified Theory]]", "sha1": "7l2tl3sjsnn9gjivdntmpd2gehix6xw"}}, {"title": "GTE", "ns": "0", "id": "12611", "revision": {"id": "849719402", "parentid": "847127077", "timestamp": "2018-07-10T21:44:59Z", "contributor": {"username": "Trappist the monk", "id": "10289486"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* General Telephone */ cite repair;", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name   = GTE Corporation\n| logo   = [[Image:GTE logo.svg|alt=GTE corporate logo, 1971-2000]] \n| type           = [[Public company|Public]]\n| fate           = Acquired by [[Bell Atlantic]]\n| successor      = [[Verizon Communications]]\n| foundation     = 1934\n| defunct        = 2000\n| location       = [[Stamford, Connecticut]], U.S.\n| industry       = [[Telecommunications]]\n| products       = [[Telephone]], [[internet]], [[television]]\n| subsid         = [[GTE Southwest]]<br>[[CODETEL]]<br>[[Verizon California]]<br>[[Verizon Florida]]<br>[[Verizon North]]<br>[[Verizon South]]<br>[[Hawaiian Telephone]]<br>[[Puerto Rico Telephone]]<br>\n| homepage        = [https://web.archive.org/*/http://www.gte.com GTE.com]\n}}\n\n'''GTE Corporation''', formerly '''General Telephone & Electronics Corporation''' (1955\u20131982),<ref>{{cite web|title=Bell Atlantic and GTE Pick Post-Merger Name|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/04/business/bell-atlantic-and-gte-pick-post-merger-name.html|newspaper = New York Times|date=April 4, 2000|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}</ref> was the largest [[independent telephone company]] in the United States during the days of the [[Bell System]].

O'Connell, Sigurd L. Odegard, and John A. Pratt) pooled $33,500 to purchase the Richland Center Telephone Company, serving 1,466 telephones in the dairy belt of southern Wisconsin. In 1920, the three accountants formed a corporation, Commonwealth Telephone Company, with Odegard as president, Pratt as vice-president, and O'Connell as secretary. Richland Center Telephone became part of Commonwealth Telephone, which quickly purchased telephone companies in three nearby communities. In 1922, Pratt resigned as vice-president and was replaced by Clarence R. Brown, a former Bell System employee.<ref name=\"FundingU\"/>\n\nBy the mid-1920s, Commonwealth Telephone had extended beyond Wisconsin borders and purchased the Belvidere Telephone Company in Illinois. It also diversified into other utilities by acquiring two small Wisconsin electrical companies. Expansion was stepped up in 1926, when Odegard secured an option to purchase [[Verizon California|Associated Telephone Company]] of Long Beach, California and proceeded to devise a plan for a holding company, to be named Associated Telephone Utilities Company. An aggressive acquisition program was quickly launched in eastern, midwestern, and western states, with the company using its own common stock to complete transactions.\n\nDuring its first six years, Associated Telephone Utilities acquired 340 telephone companies, which were consolidated into 45 companies operating more than 437,000 telephones in 25 states. By the time the stock market bottomed out in October 1929, Associated Telephone Utilities was operating about 500,000 telephones with revenues approaching $17 million.\n\nIn January 1930, a new subsidiary, Associated Telephone Investment Company, was established. Designed to support its parent's acquisition program, the new company's primary business was buying company stock in order to bolster its market value. Within two years, the investment company had incurred major losses, and a $1 million loan had to be negotiated. Associated Telephone Investment was dissolved but not before its parent's financial plight had become irreversible, and in 1933, Associated Telephone Utilities went into receivership.\n\n===General Telephone===\nThe company was reorganized that same year and resurfaced in 1935 as General Telephone Corporation, operating 12 newly consolidated companies. John Winn, a 26-year veteran of the [[Bell System]], was named president. In 1936, General Telephone created a new subsidiary, General Telephone Directory Company, to publish directories for the parent's entire service area.\n\nLike other businesses, the telephone industry was under government restrictions during World War II, and General Telephone was called upon to increase services at military bases and war-production factories. Following the war, General Telephone reactivated an acquisitions program that had been dormant for more than a decade and purchased 118,000 telephone lines between 1946 and 1950. In 1950, General Telephone purchased its first telephone-equipment manufacturing subsidiary, [[Leich Electric]] Company, along with the related Leich Sales Corporation.\n\nGeneral Telephone\u2019s holdings included 15 telephone companies across 20 states by 1951, when [[Donald C. Power]] (attorney, utilities commissioner and former executive secretary for Ohio Governor John Bricker) was named president of the company under chairman and long-time GT executive Morris F. LaCroix, replacing the retiring Harold Bozell (president 1940 - 1951). Power proceeded to expand the company through the 1950s principally through two acquisitions.\n\nIn 1955, [[Theodore Gary & Company]], the second-largest independent telephone company, which had 600,000 telephone lines, was merged into General Telephone, which had grown into the largest independent outside the Bell System. The merger gave the company 2.5 million lines. Theodore Gary's assets included telephone operations in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[British Columbia]], and the [[Philippines]], as well as [[Automatic Electric]], the second-largest telephone equipment manufacturer in the U.S. It also had a subsidiary, named the General Telephone and Electric Corporation, formed in 1930 with the [[Transamerica Corporation]] and British investors to compete against ITT.<ref>\"Transamerica into Telephones,\" Time Magazine, 20 October 1930.</ref>\n\nIn 1959, General Telephone and [[Sylvania Electric Products]] merged, and the parent's name was changed to General Telephone & Electronics Corporation (GT&E). The merger gave Sylvania - a leader in such industries as lighting, [[television]] and [[radio]], and [[chemistry]] and [[metallurgy]] - the needed capital to expand. For General Telephone, the merger meant the added benefit of Sylvania's extensive research and development capabilities in the field of electronics. Power also orchestrated other acquisitions in the late 1950s, including Peninsular Telephone Company in Florida, with 300,000 lines, and Lenkurt Electric Company, Inc., a leading producer of [[microwave]] and data transmissions systems.\n\nIn 1960, the subsidiary GT&E International Incorporated was formed to consolidate manufacturing and marketing activities of Sylvania, Automatic Electric, and Lenkurt, outside the United States. Power was named C.E.O. and chairman in 1961, making way for Leslie H. Warner, formerly of Theodore Gary, to become president. During the next several years, the scope of GT&E's research, development, and marketing activities was broadened. In 1963, Sylvania began full-scale production of color television picture tubes, and within two years, it was supplying color tubes for 18 of the 23 domestic U.S. television manufacturers. About the same time, Automatic Electric began supplying electronic switching equipment for the U.S. defense department's global communications systems, and GT&E International began producing earth-based stations for both foreign and domestic markets. GT&E's telephone subsidiaries, meanwhile, began acquiring community-antenna television systems ([[CATV]]) franchises in their operating areas.\n\nIn 1964, Warner orchestrated a deal that merged [[Western Utilities Corporation]], the nation's second-largest independent telephone company, with 635,000 telephones, into GT&E. The following year Sylvania introduced the revolutionary four-sided [[Flash (photography)#Flashcubes, Magicubes and Flipflash|flashcube]], enhancing its position as the world's largest flashbulb producer. Acquisitions in telephone service continued under Warner during the mid-1960s. Purchases included [[Quebec Telephone]] in Canada, [[Hawaiian Telcom|Hawaiian Telephone Company]], and Northern Ohio Telephone Company and added a total of 622,000 telephone lines to GT&E operations. By 1969, GT&E was serving ten million telephones.\n\n[[File:KarTrak code.jpg|thumb|[[KarTrak]] Automated Car Identification system on a caboose in Florida.]]In the late 1960s, GT&E joined in the search for a railroad car [[Automatic Car Identification]] system. It designed the [[KarTrak]] optical system, which won over other manufacturer's systems in field trials, but ultimately proved to need too much maintenance. In the late 1970s the system was abandoned.\n\nIn March 1970, GT&E's New York City headquarters was bombed by a radical antiwar group in protest of the company's participation in defense work. In December of that year the GT&E board agreed to move the company's headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut. In 1971 GT&E undertook an identity change and became simply GTE, while Sylvania Electric Products became GTE Sylvania.<ref>{{cite web |title=Company History |url=http://www.vintagesylvania.net/?page=history |website=Vintage Sylvania |access-date=August 28, 2014}}</ref> The same year, Donald C. Power retired and Leslie H. Warner became chairman of the Board. Theodore F. Brophy was brought in as president.\n\nAfter first proposing to build separate satellite systems, GTE and its telecommunications rival, [[American Telephone & Telegraph]], announced in 1974 joint venture plans for the construction and operation of seven earth-based stations interconnected by two satellites. Also in 1974 Sylvania acquired name and distribution rights for [[Philco]] television and stereo products. GTE International expanded its activities during the same period, acquiring television manufacturers in Canada and Israel and a telephone manufacturer in Germany.\n\nIn 1976, newly elected chairman Theodore F. Brophy reorganized the company along five global product lines: communications, lighting, consumer electronics, precision materials, and electrical equipment. GTE International was phased out during the reorganization, and GTE Products Corporation was formed to encompass both domestic and foreign manufacturing and marketing operations. At the same time, GTE Communications Products was formed to oversee operations of Automatic Electric, Lenkurt, Sylvania, and GTE Information Systems. In 1979, another reorganization soon followed under new president Thomas A. Vanderslice. GTE Products Group was eliminated as an organizational unit and GTE Electrical Products, consisting of lighting, precision materials, and electrical equipment, was formed. Vanderslice also revitalized the GT&E Telephone Operating Group in order to develop competitive strategies for anticipated regulatory changes in the telecommunications industry.\n\nIn 1979, GTE purchased [[Telenet]] to establish a presence in the growing [[packet switching]] [[data communications]] business. GTE Telenet was later included in the [[Sprint-Nextel#United Telecom|US Telecom]] joint venture.\n\n===1980s===\nGT&E sold its consumer electronics businesses, including the accompanying brand names of Philco and Sylvania to [[Philips]] in 1981, after watching revenues from television and radio operations decrease precipitously with the success of foreign manufacturers. Following AT&T's 1982 announcement that it would divest 22 telephone operating companies, GT&E made a number of reorganization moves.\n\nIn 1982, the company adopted the name GTE Corporation and formed GTE Mobilnet Incorporated to handle the company's entrance into the new cellular telephone business. In 1983 GTE sold its electrical equipment, brokerage information services, and cable television equipment businesses. That same year, Automatic Electric and Lenkurt were combined as GTE Network Systems.\n\nGTE became the third-largest long-distance telephone company in 1983 through the acquisition of Southern Pacific Communications Company. At the same time, Southern Pacific Satellite Company was acquired, and the two firms were renamed GTE [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint Communications Corporation]] and GTE [[Spacenet]] Corporation, respectively. Through an agreement with the Department of Justice, GTE conceded to keep Sprint Communications separate from its other telephone companies and limit other GTE telephone subsidiaries in certain markets. In December 1983 Vanderslice resigned as president and chief operating officer.\n[[File:GTE manhole cover - Hillsboro, Oregon.JPG|thumb|A manhole cover featuring the company logo in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]]]]\nIn 1984, GTE formalized its decision to concentrate on three core businesses: telecommunications, lighting, and precision metals. That same year, the company's first satellite was launched, and GTE's cellular telephone service went into operation; GTE's earnings exceeded $1 billion for the first time. In 1986, GTE acquired Airfone Inc., a telephone service provider for commercial aircraft and railroads, and Rotaflex plc, a United Kingdom-based manufacturer of lighting fixtures.\n\nBeginning in 1986, GTE spun off several operations to form joint ventures. That same year, GTE Sprint and United Telecommunication's long-distance subsidiary, [[Sprint Corporation#United Telecommunications (United Telecom)|US Telecom]], agreed to merge and form US Sprint Communications Company, with each parent retaining a 50 percent interest in the new firm. That same year, GTE transferred its international transmission, overseas central office switching, and business systems operations to a joint venture with Siemens AG of Germany, which took 80 percent ownership of the new firm. The following year, GTE transferred its business systems operations in the United States to a new joint venture, Fujitsu GTE Business Systems, Inc., formed with [[Fujitsu Limited]], which retained 80 percent ownership.\n\nIn April 1988, after the retirement of Theodore F. Brophy, James L. \"Rocky\" Johnson was promoted from his position as president and chief operating officer to CEO and chairman of GTE.  Under his leadership, GTE divested its consumer communications products unit as part of a telecommunications strategy to place increasing emphasis on the services sector. The following year GTE sold the majority of its interest in US Sprint to United Telecommunications and its interest in Fujitsu GTE Business Systems to Fujitsu.\n\nIn 1989, GTE and AT&T formed the joint venture company AG Communication Systems Corporation, designed to bring advanced digital technology to GTE's switching systems. GTE retained 51 percent control over the joint venture, with AT&T pledging to take complete control of the new firm in 15 years.\n\nWith an increasing emphasis on telecommunications, in 1989 GTE launched a program to become the first cellular provider offering nationwide service and introduced the nation's first rural service area, providing cellular service on the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai]]. The following year GTE acquired the [[The Providence Journal|Providence Journal Company]]'s cellular properties in five southern states for $710 million and became the second largest cellular-service provider in the United States.\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1990, GTE reorganized its activities around three business groups: telecommunications products and services, telephone operations, and electrical products. That same year, GTE and [[Contel]] Corporation announced merger plans that would strengthen GTE's telecommunications and telephone sectors.\n\nFollowing action or review by more than 20 governmental bodies, in March 1991 the merger of GTE and Contel was approved. Over half of Contel's $6.6 billion purchase price, $3.9 billion, was assumed debt. In April 1992, James L. \"Rocky\" Johnson retired after 43 years at GTE, remaining on the GTE board of directors as Chairman Emeritus.  Charles \"Chuck\" Lee was named to succeed Johnson. Lee's first order of business was reduction of that obligation. He sold GTE's North American Lighting business to a Siemens affiliate for over $1 billion, shaved off local exchange properties in [[Idaho]], [[Tennessee]], [[Utah]], and [[West Virginia]] to generate another $1 billion, and divested its interest in [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] in 1992. In 1994, he sold its GTE [[Spacenet]] satellite operations to [[General Electric]] and sold Contel of Maine to [[Oxford Networks]], which placed the company into a newly created subsidiary, [[Oxford West Telephone]].\n\nThe [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] promised to encourage competition among local phone providers, long distance services, and cable television companies. Many leading telecoms prepared for the new competitive realities by aligning themselves with entertainment and information providers. GTE, on the other hand, continued to focus on its core operations, seeking to make them as efficient as possible.\n\nAmong other goals, GTE's plan sought to double revenues and slash costs by $1 billion per year by focusing on five key areas of operation: technological enhancement of wireline and wireless systems, expansion of data services, global expansion, and diversification into video services. GTE hoped to cross-sell its large base of wireline customers on wireless, data and video services, launching Tele-Go, a user-friendly service that combined cordless and cellular phone features. The company bought broadband spectrum cellular licenses in Atlanta, Seattle, Cincinnati and Denver, and formed a joint venture with [[SBC Communications]] to enhance its cellular capabilities in Texas. In 1995, the company undertook a 15-state test of video conferencing services, as well as a video dialtone (VDT) experiment that proposed to offer cable television programming to 900,000 homes by 1997. GTE also formed a video programming and interservices joint venture with [[Ameritech]] Corporation, [[BellSouth]] Corporation, SBC, and [[The Walt Disney Company]] in the fall of 1995.\n\nForeign efforts included affiliations with phone companies in [[Argentina]], Mexico, Germany, Japan, Canada, the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Venezuela]] and China. The early 1990s reorganization included a 37.5 percent workforce reduction, from 177,500 in 1991 to 111,000 by 1994. Lee's fivefold strategy had begun to bear fruit by the mid-1990s. While the communication conglomerate's sales remained rather flat, at about $19.8 billion, from 1992 through 1994, its net income increased by 43.7 percent, from $1.74 billion to a record $2.5 billion, during the same period.<ref name=\"FundingU\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/GTE-Corporation-Company-History.html |title=GTE Corporation - Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |access-date=February 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Acquisition by Bell Atlantic==\n[[Image:Verizon Logo 2000 to 2015.svg|thumb|200px|right|Original Verizon logo introduced at the time of the acquisition]]<!--For illustration purposes of BA/GTE acquisition KEEP IT THERE!-->\nBell Atlantic acquired GTE on June 30, 2000, and named the new entity [[Verizon Communications]].

After achieving some early success, both were assassinated by enemies of these reforms.\n\n==Early life==\nThe brothers were born to a [[Plebs|plebeian]] branch of the old and noble [[Sempronia (gens)|Sempronia family]]. Their father was the elderly [[Tiberius Gracchus the Elder]] (or Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus) who was [[tribune of the plebs]], [[praetor]], [[consul]], and [[Roman censor|censor]]. Their mother was a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]: [[Cornelia Africana]], daughter of [[Scipio Africanus]], himself considered a hero by the Roman populace for his part in the war against Carthage. Their parents had 12 children, but only [[Sempronia (sister of the Gracchi)|one daughter]] - who later married [[Scipio Aemilianus]] (Scipio Africanus the Younger) - and two sons, Tiberius and Gaius, survived childhood.<ref name=\"Grandeur\">{{cite book |last=Stobart|first=J.C.| editor1-first = W.S |editor1-last=Maguinness |editor2-first=H.H. |editor2-last=Scullard|title=The Grandeur That was Rome|edition=4th |chapter = III|pages = 75\u201382|orig-year=1964|publisher =Book Club Associates |year=1978}}</ref>\n\nAfter the boys' father died while they were young, responsibility for their education fell to their mother. Cornelia ensured that the brothers had the best available Greek tutors, teaching them oratory and political science. The brothers were also well trained in martial pursuits; in horsemanship and combat they outshone all their peers. The older brother Tiberius was elected an [[augur]] at only 16 \u2013 according to the historian J. C. Stobart, had he taken the easy path rather than the cause of radical reform, he would have been clearly destined for [[Roman consul|consulship]]. Tiberius was the most distinguished young officer in the [[Third Punic War]], Rome's last campaign against [[Carthage]]. He was the first to scale Carthage's walls; before that he saved an army of 20,000 men by skilled diplomacy. As the boys grew up, they developed strong connections with the ruling elite.<ref name=\"Grandeur\"/>\n\n==Gracchi reforms==\n\n=== Background ===\nCentral to the Gracchi reforms was an attempt to address economic distress and its military consequences. Much [[public land]] (''[[ager publicus]]'') had been divided among large landholders and speculators who further expanded their estates by driving peasants off their farms. While their old lands were being worked by slaves, the peasants were often forced into idleness in Rome where they had to subsist on handouts due to a scarcity of paid work. They could not legally join the army because they did not meet the property qualification; and this, together with the lack of public land to give in exchange for military service and the [[mutiny|mutinies]] in the [[Numantine War]], caused recruitment problems and troop shortages.\n\nThe Gracchi aimed to address these problems by reclaiming lands from wealthy members of the senatorial class that could then be granted to soldiers; by restoring land to displaced peasants; by providing subsidized grain for the needy and by having the Republic pay for the clothing of its poorest soldiers.<ref name = \"Rubicon\">{{cite book|author = [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]]|title=[[Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic]]|year= 2004|isbn=9780349115634|pages = 28\u201330|publisher = Abacus}}</ref>\n\n===Efforts of Tiberius Gracchus===\n[[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius]] was elected to the office of [[Tribune of the Plebs]] in 133 BC. He immediately began pushing for a programme of [[land reform]], partly by invoking the 240-year-old [[Lex Licinia Sextia|Sextian-Licinian law]] that limited the amount of land that could be owned by a single individual. Using the powers of [[Lex Hortensia]], Tiberius established a commission to oversee the redistribution of land holdings from the rich to the unlanded urban poor. The commission consisted of himself, his father-in-law and his brother Gaius.<ref name=\"Grandeur\"/>\n\nEven liberal senators were agitated by the proposed changes, fearing their own lands would be confiscated. Senators arranged for other tribunes to oppose the reforms. Tiberius then appealed to the people, and argued that a tribune who opposes the will of the people in favour of the rich is not a true tribune. The senators were left with only one constitutional response \u2013 to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This meant Tiberius had to stand for a second term.<ref name=\"Grandeur\"/>\n\nThe senators obstructed his re-election. They also gathered an ''ad hoc''{{efn|Latin: \"for this purpose; literally \"towards this\" \u2013 the force being assembled for the specific purpose of deposing Tiberius as a tribune.}} force, with several of them personally marching to the Forum, and had Tiberius and some 300 of his supporters clubbed to death. This was the first open bloodshed in Roman politics for nearly four centuries.<ref>{{cite book\n|author = [[Nigel Rodgers]], Hazel Dodge|title= Rome: The Greatest Empire|page = 24|year= 2005|isbn= 1-84476-150-9|publisher = Southwater}}</ref>\n\nTiberius's land reform commission continued distributing lands, albeit much more slowly than Tiberius had envisaged, as Senators were able to eliminate more of the commission's supporters by legal means.\n\n===Efforts of Gaius Gracchus===\n[[File:Gaius Gracchus Tribune of the People.jpg|thumb|300px|Gaius Gracchus addressing the [[Plebeian Council|Plebeians]].]]\nTen years later, in 123 BC, [[Gaius Gracchus|Gaius]] took the same office as his brother, as a tribune for the plebeians. Gaius was more practical minded than Tiberius, and so was considered more dangerous by the senatorial class. He gained support from the agrarian poor by reviving the land reform programme and from the urban poor with various popular measures. He also sought support from the second estate, those [[Equestrian order|equestrians]] who had not ascended to become senators.\n\nMany equestrians were [[publicans]], in charge of tax collecting in the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] (located in western [[Anatolia]]), and of contracting for construction projects. The equestrian class would get to control a court that tried senators for misconduct in provincial administration. In effect, the equestrians replaced senators already serving at the court. Thus, Gaius became an opponent of senatorial influence. Other reforms implemented by Gaius included fixing prices on [[grain]] for the urban population and granting improvements in citizenship for [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] and others outside the city of Rome.\n\nWith this broad coalition of supporters, Gaius held his office for two years and had much of his prepared legislation passed. This included winning an unconstitutional, although not necessarily illegal, re-election to the one-year office of Tribune.<ref name = \"Rubicon\"/> However Gaius's plans to extend rights to non-Roman Italians were eventually vetoed by another Tribune. A substantial proportion of the Roman poor, protective of their privileged Roman citizenship, turned against Gaius.<ref name=\"Grandeur\"/> With Gaius's support from the people weakened, the consul [[Lucius Opimius]] was able to crush the Gracchan movement by force. A mob was raised to assassinate Gaius. Knowing his death was imminent, he committed suicide on the [[Aventine Hill]] in 121 BC. All of his reforms were undermined except for the grain laws. Three thousand supporters were subsequently arrested and put to death in the [[proscription]]s that followed.\n\n===Assessment and reasons for failure===\nAccording to the classicist [[J. C. Stobart]], Tiberius's Greek education had caused him to overestimate the reliability of the people as a power base, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune, the people enjoyed much less influence than at the height of the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[Athenian democracy|democracy]]. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the [[Roman Constitution|Roman constitution]], specifically the [[Tribal Assembly]], was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time \u2013 and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that another reason for the failure was the Gracchi's idealism: they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.<ref name=\"Grandeur\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Oswald Spengler]], the characteristic mistake of the Gracchan age was to believe in the possibility of the reversibility of history<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Spengler\n|first=Oswald\n|title=[[The Decline of the West]](An abridged edition)\n|page = 384\n|year=1922\n|isbn=1-4000-9700-2\n|publisher =Vintage Books, 2006}}</ref> \u2013 a form of idealism which according to Spengler was at that time shared by both sides of the political spectrum \u2013 [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] had sought to turn back the clock to the time of [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]], and restore virtue by returning to austerity.<ref name=\"Grandeur\"/>\n\nThe philosopher [[Simone Weil]] ranked the conduct of the Gracchi second out of all the known cases of good-hearted conduct recorded by history for classical Rome, ahead of the Scipios and Virgil.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=[[Simone Weil]]\n|title=[[The Need for Roots]]\n|page = 228\n|year=2002\n|isbn=0-415-27102-9\n|publisher = [[Routledge]]}}</ref>{{efn|Weil gives first ranking to Gaius Plotius Plancus and his slaves. During the proscriptions of the [[Second Triumvirate]], the slaves endured torture so as to protect their master, the master seeing this came out of hiding to spare his slaves further pain and was executed.}}\n\nHistorian [[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael Crawford]] attributes the disappearance of much of Tiberius Gracchus' support to the reduced level of citizen participation due to dispersal far from Rome, and sees his tribunate as marking a step in the Hellenization of the Roman aristocracy. Crawford asserts that Gaius Gracchus' extortion law shifted the balance of power in Rome and that the Gracchi made available a new political armoury which the oligarchy subsequently sought to exploit.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Michael|title=The Roman Republic|date=1992|publisher=Fontana|location=London|isbn=9780006862505|pages=110\u2013111, 121\u2013123|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe emergence of new forces of urban factions, rural voters, and others, engaging in continued conflict with each other for their own interests, meant that the problem of effective governance awaited resolution. The [[populism|populist]] government of the Gracchi had come to an end by violence; and this provided a brutal precedent that would be followed by many future rulers of Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bauer|first=Susan|title=The History of the Ancient World|date=2007}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Badian|first=E.|title=Foreign Clientelae, 264\u2013270 BC|year=1984|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Alvin H.|title=Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus : tradition and apostasy|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=0-8014-1078-9}}\n*{{cite book|last=Boren|first=Henry C.|title=The Gracchi|year=1969|publisher=Twayne|location=New York}}\n*{{cite book|last=Earl|first=Donald C.|title=Tiberius Gracchus : a study in politics|year=1963|publisher=Latomus|location=Bruxelles-Berchem}}\n*{{cite book|last=Oman|first=Charles|title=Seven Roman statesmen of the later republic : the Gracchi, Sulla, Crassus, Cato, Pompey, Caesar|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24152141M/Seven_Roman_statesmen_of_the_later_republic|year=1903|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co|location=New York|edition=3rd}}\n*{{cite book|last=Plutarch|title=Plutarch's Lives|year=1926|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|others=Bernadotte Perrin, trans}}\n*{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Keith|title=Daggers in the Forum|year=1976|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=0-304-29540-X}}\n*{{cite book|last=Riddle|first=John M.|title=Tiberius Gracchus: destroyer or reformer of the Republic?|year=1970|publisher=Heath|location=Lexington, MA}}\n*{{cite book|last=Scullard|first=H.H.|title=From the Gracchi to Nero : a history of Rome 133 BC to AD 68|origyear=1959|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-58488-3}}\n*{{cite book|editor-last=Stockton|editor-first=David|title=From The Gracchi To Sulla : sources for Roman history, 133-80B.C.|year=1985|publisher=London Association of Classical Teachers|location=Harrow|isbn=0-903625-16-4}}\n*{{cite book|last=Stockton|first=David|title=The Gracchi|year=1979|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-872104-8}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=yes |others=yes |about=yes |label=Gracchi\n  |viaf= |lccn= |lcheading= |wikititle= }}\n*[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#18 Translation of Book 1 of ''The Civil Wars''] by [[Appian]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111005103705/http://www.third-millennium-library.com/readinghall/GalleryofHistory/Roman_People/Tiberius_Gracchus/Door.html Tiberius Gracchus (168\u2013133 BCE) by Hugh Last (BTM format)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130502231817/http://cristoraul.com/ENGLISH/readinghall/GalleryofHistory/Gracci-Marius-Sulla/GMS_DOOR.htm T Gracchi, Marius and Sulla by A.

In the 16th century, the word assumed the meaning of a person, mostly a woman, one who delights in idle talk, a newsmonger, a tattler.<ref>[[OED]]</ref> In the early 19th century, the term was extended from the talker to the conversation of such persons. The verb ''to gossip'', meaning \"to be a gossip\", first appears in [[Shakespeare]].\n\nThe term originates from the bedroom at the time of childbirth. Giving birth used to be a social event exclusively attended by women. The pregnant woman's female relatives and neighbours would congregate and idly converse. Over time, gossip came to mean talk of others.<ref>\"If Walls Could Talk: The History of the Home (Bedroom), Lucy Worsley,  BBC\"</ref>\n\nOthers say that gossip comes from the same root as \"gospel\" -- it is a contraction of \"good spiel\", meaning a good story.\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:No chat.jpg|thumb|This Soviet [[World War II posters from the Soviet Union|war poster]] conveys the message: \"Don't chatter!

Agin, Swiggart & Agin, LLC, Mass High Tech, November 18, 1996.</ref> Low [[self-esteem]] and a desire to \"fit in\" are frequently cited as motivations for workplace gossip.\nThere are five essential functions that gossip has in the workplace (according to DiFonzo & Bordia):\n* Helps individuals learn social information about other individuals in the organization (often without even having to meet the other individual)\n* Builds social networks of individuals by bonding co-workers together and affiliating people with each other.\n* Breaks existing bonds by ostracizing individuals within an organization.\n* Enhances one's social status/power/prestige within the organization.\n* Inform individuals as to what is considered socially acceptable behavior within the organization.\n\nAccording to Kurkland and Pelled, workplace gossip can be very serious depending upon the amount of [[Power (social and political)|power]] that the gossiper has over the recipient, which will in turn affect how the gossip is interpreted. There are four types of power that are influenced by gossip:\n* '''Coercive:''' when a gossiper tells negative information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread negative information about them. This causes the gossiper's coercive power to increase.\n* '''Reward:''' when a gossiper tells positive information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread positive information about them. This causes the gossiper's reward power to increase.\n* '''Expert:''' when a gossiper seems to have very detailed knowledge of either the organization's values or about others in the work environment, their expert power becomes enhanced.\n* '''Referent:''' this power can either be reduced OR enhanced to a point. When people view gossiping as a petty activity done to waste time, a gossiper's referent power can decrease along with their reputation. When a recipient is thought of as being invited into a social circle by being a recipient, the gossiper's referent power can increase, but only to a high point where then the recipient begins to resent the gossiper (Kurland & Pelled).\n\nSome negative consequences of workplace gossip may include:<ref>[http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/feap/newsletters/workplace-gossip.pdf Workplace Gossip] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127130859/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/feap/newsletters/workplace-gossip.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}, Kit Hennessy, LPC, CEAP.</ref>\n* Lost productivity and wasted time,\n* Erosion of trust and morale,\n* Increased anxiety among employees as rumors circulate without any clear information as to what is fact and what isn\u2019t,\n* Growing divisiveness among employees as people \u201ctake sides,\"\n* Hurt feelings and reputations,\n* Jeopardized chances for the gossipers' advancement as they are perceived as unprofessional, and\n* Attrition as good employees leave the company due to the unhealthy work atmosphere.\nTurner and Weed theorize that among the three main types of responders to [[workplace conflict]] are attackers who cannot keep their feelings to themselves and express their feelings by attacking whatever they can. Attackers are further divided into up-front attackers and behind-the-back attackers. Turner and Weed note that the latter \"are difficult to handle because the target person is not sure of the source of any criticism, nor even always sure that there is criticism.\"<ref>Conflict in organizations: Practical solutions any manager can use; Turner, Stephen P. (University of South Florida); Weed, Frank; 1983.</ref>\n\nIt is possible however, that there may be illegal, unethical, or disobedient behavior happening at the workplace and this may be a case where reporting the behavior may be viewed as gossip. It is then left up to the authority in charge to fully investigate the matter and not simply look past the report and assume it to be workplace gossip.\n\nInformal networks through which communication occurs in an organization are sometimes called the [[grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]. In a study done by Harcourt, Richerson, and Wattier, it was found that middle managers in several different organizations believed that gathering information from the grapevine was a much better way of learning information than through formal communication with their subordinates (Harcourt, Richerson & Wattier).\n\n==Various views==\nSome see gossip as trivial, hurtful and socially and/or intellectually unproductive. Some people view gossip as a lighthearted way of spreading information. A [[feminism|feminist]] definition of gossip presents it as \"a way of talking between women, intimate in style, personal and domestic in scope and setting, a female cultural event which springs from and perpetuates the restrictions of the female role, but also gives the comfort of validation.\" (Jones, 1990:243)\n\n===In early modern England===\n<!-- this section might fit better in an as-yet non-existent article called something like [[gossip (companion)]] -->\n\nIn [[Early Modern Britain|Early Modern England]] the word \"gossip\" referred to companions in [[childbirth]], not limited to the [[midwife]]. It also became a term for women-friends generally, with no necessary derogatory connotations.

It commonly referred to an informal local [[sorority]] or social group, who could enforce socially acceptable behaviour through private censure or through public rituals, such as \"[[rough music]]\", the [[cucking stool]] and the [[skimmington ride]].\n\nIn [[Thomas Harman]]\u2019s ''Caveat for Common Cursitors'' 1566 a \u2018[[Thieves' cant|walking mort]]\u2019 relates how she was forced to agree to meet a man in his barn, but informed his wife. The wife arrived with her \u201cfive furious, sturdy, muffled gossips\u201d who catch the errant husband with \u201chis hosen about his legs\u201d and give him a sound beating.

(2007). \"Gossip in the New Testament.\" ''The New Testament in Cross-Cultural Perspective.'' Eugene: Cascade Books.</ref> Of course, this does not mean that there are ''not'' numerous texts in the New Testament that see gossip as dangerous negative speech.\n\nThus, for example, the [[Epistle to the Romans]] associates gossips (\"backbiters\") with a list of sins including sexual immorality and with murder:\n\n<blockquote>\n:28: And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;\n:29: Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,\n:30: Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,\n:31: Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:\n:32: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. (Romans 1:28-32)\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Matthew 18]], Jesus also taught that conflict resolution among church members ought to begin with the aggrieved party attempting to resolve their dispute with the offending party alone. Only if this did not work would the process escalate to the next step, in which another church member would become involved. After that if the person at fault still would not \"hear\", the matter was to be fully investigated by the church elders, and if not resolved to be then exposed publicly.\n\nBased on texts like these portraying gossip negatively, many Christian authors generalize on the phenomenon. So, in order to gossip, writes Phil Fox Rose, we \"must harden our heart towards the 'out' person. We draw a line between ourselves and them; define them as being outside the rules of Christian charity... We create a gap between ourselves and God's Love.\" As we harden our heart towards more people and groups, he continues, \"this negativity and feeling of separateness will grow and permeate our world, and we'll find it more difficult to access God\u2019s love in any aspect of our lives.\"<ref>Phil Fox Rose, [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/philfoxrose/2012/10/gossip-hardens-our-hearts/ \"Gossip hardens our hearts\"], ''Patheos''. Accessed February 23, 2013.</ref>\n\nAlternatively, and ironically, biblical scholars have noticed that many of the heroes of the Christian bible engage in gossip about those who are portrayed as \"opponents\" in some way.  In Matthew 21-23, Jesus engages in peculiarly vitriolic gossip about the Pharisees and Scribes: \"Scribes, Pharisees. Hypocrites!\" Another example of gossip by a biblical hero is Paul's attack on Peter in a letter he wrote to the churches in Galatia (Galatians 2:11-14) where Paul describes Peter to the Galatians as a fearful hypocrite. Opponents of biblical heroes gossip, too. So, in John's gospel, for example, the Judeans gossip \"among themselves\" negatively about Jesus by asking \"how can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" (John 6:52).\n\nThus, it should be recognized that although the Bible is, generally speaking, against Gossip (Proverbs 18:8; Romans 1:29; 2 Cor 12:20; 1 Tim 5:13; 3 John 1:10, et al.), it also describes the social process being utilized effectively by some of its main characters, including Jesus and Paul.<ref>Daniels, John W. (2012). \"Gossip in the New Testament.\" ''Biblical Theology Bulletin'' 42/4. pp. 210-211.</ref>\n\nThe New Testament is also in favor of group accountability (Ephesians 5:11; 1st Tim 5:20; James 5:16; Gal 6:1-2; 1 Cor 12:26), which may be associated with gossip.\n\n===In Islam===\n\nIslam considers [[backbiting]] the equivalent of eating the flesh of one's dead brother. According to Muslims, backbiting harms its victims without offering them any chance of defense, just as dead people cannot defend against their flesh being eaten. Muslims are expected to treat others like brothers (regardless of their beliefs, skin color, gender, or ethnic origin), deriving from Islam's concept of brotherhood amongst its believers.\n\n===In Bahai Faith===\n\nBahais consider backbiting to be the \"worst human quality and the most great sin...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bahaiquotes.com/quotepage.php?Quotes%2FBackbiting|website=Bahai Quotes.com|accessdate=11 November 2017}}</ref> Therefore, even murder would be considered less reprobate than backbiting. [[Baha'u'llah]] stated, \"Backbiting quencheth the light of the heart, and extinguisheth the life of the soul.\"  When someone kills another, it only affects their physical condition.  However, when someone gossips, it affects one in a different manner.\n\n==In psychology==\n\n===Evolutionary view===\nFrom Dunbar's evolutionary theories, gossip originated to help bond the groups that were constantly growing in size. To survive, individuals need alliances; but as these alliances grew larger, it was difficult if not impossible to physically connect with everyone. Conversation and language were able to bridge this gap. Gossip became a social interaction that helped the group gain information about other individuals without personally speaking to them. It enabled people to keep up with what was going on in their social network. It also creates a bond between the teller and the hearer, as they share information of mutual interest and spend time together. It also helps the hearer learn about another individual\u2019s behavior and helps them have a more effective approach to their relationship. Dunbar (2004) found that 65% of conversations consist of social topics.<ref name=\"Dunbar\">Dunbar, R. (2004). Gossip in evolutionary perspective. Review of General Psychology, 8(2), 100-110.</ref>\n\nDunbar (1994) argues that gossip is the equivalent of [[social grooming]] often observed in other primate species.<ref name=\"Dunbar, R.I.M. 1994\">Dunbar, R.I.M. (1994). Grooming, gossip, and the evolution of language.

(2004). Research on gossip: Taxonomy, methods, and future directions. Review of General Psychology, 8 (2), 78-99.</ref>\nFurther support for the evolutionary significance of gossip comes from a recent study published in the peer-reviewed journal, Science. Anderson and colleagues (2011) found that faces paired with negative social information dominate visual consciousness to a greater extent than positive and neutral social information during a binocular rivalry task. Binocular rivalry occurs when two different stimuli are presented to each eye simultaneously and the two percepts compete for dominance in visual consciousness. While this occurs, an individual will consciously perceive one of the percepts while the other is suppressed. After a time, the other percept will become dominant and an individual will become aware of the second percept. Finally, the two percepts will alternate back and forth in terms of visual awareness. The study by Anderson and colleagues (2011) indicates that higher order cognitive processes, like evaluative information processing, can influence early visual processing. That only negative social information differentially affected the dominance of the faces during the task alludes to the unique importance of knowing information about an individual that should be avoided. Since the positive social information did not produce greater perceptual dominance of the matched face indicates that negative information about an individual may be more salient to our behavior than positive.<ref name=\"Anderson\">Anderson, E., Siegel, E.H., Bliss-Moreau, E. & Barrett, L.F. (2011). The visual impact of gossip. Science Magazine, 332, 1446-1448.</ref>\n\nGossip also gives information about social norms and guidelines for behavior. Gossip usually comments on how appropriate a behavior was, and the mere act of repeating it signifies its importance. In this sense, gossip is effective regardless of whether it is positive or negative<ref>Baumeister, R. F., Zhang, L., & Vohs, K. D. (2004). Gossip as cultural learning. Review of General Psychology, 8, 111\u2013121.</ref> Some theorists have proposed that gossip is actually a pro-social behavior intended to allow an individual to correct their socially prohibitive behavior without direct confrontation of the individual. By gossiping about an individual\u2019s acts, other individuals can subtly indicate that said acts are inappropriate and allow the individual to correct their behavior (Schoeman 1994).\n\n===Perception of those who gossip===\nIndividuals who are perceived to engage in gossiping regularly are seen as having less social power and being less liked. The type of gossip being exchanged also affects likeability whereby those who engage in negative gossip are less liked than those who engage in positive gossip.<ref>Farley, S. (2011). Is gossip power? The inverse relationship between gossip, power, and likability. European Journal of Social Psychology, 41, 574-579.</ref> In a study done by Turner and colleagues (2003), having a prior relationship with a gossiper were not found to protect the gossiper from less favorable personality ratings after gossip was exchanged. In the study, two individuals were brought in to the research lab to participate. Either the two individuals were friends prior to the study or they were strangers scheduled to participate at the same time. One of the individuals was a confederate of the study and they engaged in gossiping about the research assistant after she left the room. The gossip exchanged was either positive or negative. Regardless of gossip type (positive versus negative) or relationship type (friend versus stranger) the gossipers were rated as less trustworthy after sharing the gossip.<ref>Turner, M. M., Mazur, M.A., Wendel, N. & Winslow, R. (2003). Relationship ruin or social glue? The joint effect of relationship type and gossip valence on liking, trust, and expertise. Communication Monographs, 70, 129-141.</ref>\n\n<ref>Block, palton Walter ([1976], 1991, 2008). ''[[Defending the Undefendable]]: The Pimp, Prostitute, Scab, Slumlord, Libeler, Moneylender, and Other Scapegoats in the Rogue\u2019s Gallery of American Society'' Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute, {{ISBN|978-1-933550-17-6}}, pp. 42-43, [full text online]</ref> Block has suggested that while gossip and [[blackmail]] both involve the disclosure of unflattering information, the blackmailer is arguably ethically superior to the gossip.\n\nBlock writes, \"In a sense, the gossip is much ''worse'' than the blackmailer, for the blackmailer has given the blackmailed a chance to silence him. The gossip exposes the secret without warning.\" The victim of a blackmailer is thus offered choices denied to the subject of gossip, such as deciding if the exposure of his or her secret is worth the cost the blackmailer demands. Moreover, in refusing a blackmailer's offer one is in no worse a position than with the gossip.  Adds Block, \"It is indeed difficult, then, to account for the vilification suffered by the blackmailer, at least compared to the gossip, who is usually dismissed with slight contempt and smugness.\"\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Altruism]]\n* [[Bullying]]\n* [[Blind Item]]\n* [[Clique|Circle of Friends]]\n* [[Communication in small groups]]\n* [[Curiosity]]\n* [[False dilemma]]\n* [[Gossip magazines]]\n* [[Impression management]]\n* [[Interpersonal relationship]]\n* [[Libel]]\n* [[Misinformation]]\n* [[Personal network]]\n* [[Popularity]]\n* [[Respectability]]\n* [[Rumor]]\n* [[Scandal]]\n* [[Sexual selection in human evolution]]\n* [[Social perception]]\n* [[Social status]]\n* [[Word of mouth]]\n* [[Yenta]]\n* [[Backbiting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to [http://www.camfroger.com/ ]generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags and the tag below -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<ref>Gossip and gender differences: a content analys[http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/gUgfRg72qNuCxV2eA7Nn/full Gossip and gender differences: a content analysis approach] is approach </ref>\n==Further reading==\n* Niko Besnier, 2009: ''Gossip and the Everyday Production of Politics''.

Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by [[singing]] or playing the harmonica.\n\n==Techniques==\nThe guitarist may employ any of several methods for sounding the guitar, including finger picking, depending on the type of strings used (either [[Classical guitar strings|nylon]] or [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|steel]]), and including [[strumming]] with the fingers, or a [[guitar pick]] made of bone, horn, plastic, metal, felt, leather, or paper, and melodic [[flatpicking]] and [[fingerstyle guitar|finger-picking]]. \n\nThe guitarist may also employ various methods for selecting notes and chords, including fingering, thumbing, the barre (a finger lying across many or all strings at a particular fret), and 'bottleneck' or steel-guitar slides, usually made of glass or metal.

For fiction associated with the goth scene, see {{Section link|Goth subculture|Books and magazines}}}}\n\n'''Gothic fiction''', which is largely known by the subgenre of '''Gothic horror''', is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and [[Horror fiction|horror]], death, and at times romance. Its origin is attributed to English author [[Horace Walpole]], with his 1764 novel ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', subtitled (in its second edition) \"A Gothic Story\". The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century where, following Walpole, it was further developed by [[Clara Reeve]], [[Ann Radcliffe]], [[William Thomas Beckford]] and [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]]. The genre had much success in the 19th century, as witnessed in prose by [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] as well as [[Charles Dickens]] with his novella, ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', and in poetry in the work of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and [[Lord Byron]]. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late [[Victorian era]], is [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. The name ''Gothic'', which originally referred to the [[Goths]], and then came to mean \"German\",<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Gothic novel|pages=78\u201379|title=Glossary of Literary Terms|edition=6|first=M. H. |last=Abrams|publisher=Harcourt Brace|year=1993|isbn=0030549825}}</ref> refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating [[Gothic architecture]], in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German ''Schauerroman'' and the French ''Roman Noir''.\n\n== Early Gothic romances ==\n[[File:CastleOtranto.png|thumb|''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' (1764) is regarded as the first Gothic novel. The aesthetics of the book have shaped modern-day gothic books, films, art, music and the goth subculture.<ref name=\"Gothic genre\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30313775 \"The Castle of Otranto: The creepy tale that launched gothic fiction\"]. BBC. Retrieved 9 July 2017</ref>]]\n\nThe novel usually regarded as the first Gothic novel is ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' by English author [[Horace Walpole]], which was first published in 1764.<ref name=\"Gothic genre\"/> Walpole's declared aim was to combine elements of the medieval romance, which he deemed too fanciful, and the modern novel, which he considered to be too confined to strict realism.<ref>Punter (2004), p. 178</ref> The basic plot created many other staple Gothic generic traits, including threatening mysteries and ancestral curses, as well as countless trappings such as hidden passages and oft-fainting heroines.\n\nWalpole published the first edition disguised as a medieval romance from Italy discovered and republished by a fictitious translator. When Walpole admitted to his authorship in the second edition, its originally favourable reception by literary reviewers changed into rejection. The reviewers' rejection reflected a larger cultural bias: the [[Romance novel|romance]] was usually held in contempt by the educated as a tawdry and debased kind of writing; the genre had gained some respectability only through the works of [[Samuel Richardson]] and [[Henry Fielding]].<ref>Fuchs (2004), p. 106</ref> A romance with superstitious elements, and moreover void of didactical intention, was considered a setback and not acceptable. Walpole's forgery, together with the blend of history and fiction, contravened the principles of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and associated the Gothic novel with fake documentation.\n\n=== Clara Reeve ===\n[[Clara Reeve]], best known for her work ''[[The Old English Baron]]'' (1778), set out to take Walpole's plot and adapt it to the demands of the time by balancing fantastic elements with 18th-century realism.<ref name=\"Gothic genre\"/> In her preface, Reeve wrote: \"This Story is the literary offspring of ''The Castle of Otranto'', written upon the same plan, with a design to unite the most attractive and interesting circumstances of the ancient Romance and modern Novel.\"<ref name=\"Gothic genre\"/> The question now arose whether supernatural events that were not as evidently absurd as Walpole's would not lead the simpler minds to believe them possible.<ref>{{cite book |title=Clara Reeve ''from'' Lives of the Eminent Novelists and Dramatists |last=Scott |first=Walter |year=1870 |publisher=Frederick Warne |location=London |pages=545\u2013550 |accessdate=2012-03-12}}</ref>\n\nReeve's contribution in the development of the Gothic fiction, therefore, can be demonstrated on at least two fronts. In the first, there is the reinforcement of the Gothic narrative framework, one that focuses on expanding the imaginative domain so as to include the supernatural without losing the realism that marks the novel that Walpole pioneered.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Supernatural in Gothic Fiction: Horror, Belief, and Literary Change|last=Geary|first=Robert|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|year=1992|isbn=9780773491649|location=New York|pages=40}}</ref> Secondly, Reeve also sought to contribute to finding the appropriate formula to ensure that the fiction is believable and coherent. The result is that she spurned specific aspects to Walpole's style such as his tendency to incorporate too much humor or comic elements in such a way that it diminishes the Gothic tale's ability to induce fear. In 1777, Reeve enumerated Walpole's excesses in this respect: <blockquote>a sword so large as to require an hundred men to lift it; a helmet that by its own weight forces a passage through a court-yard into an arched vault, big enough for a man to go through; a picture that walks out of its frame; a skeleton ghost in a hermit's cowl...<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gothic and the Comic Turn|last=Horner|first=Avril|last2=Zlosnik|first2=Sue|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn=9781349415564|location=New York|pages=6}}</ref></blockquote>Although the succession of Gothic writers did not exactly heed Reeve's focus on emotional realism, she was able to posit a framework that keeps Gothic fiction within the realm of the probable. This aspect remains a challenge for authors in this genre after the publication of The Old English Baron. Outside of its providential context, the supernatural would often suffer the risk of veering towards the absurd.<ref>Geary, p. 40.</ref>\n\n=== Ann Radcliffe ===\n[[Ann Radcliffe]] developed the technique of the ''explained supernatural'' in which every seemingly supernatural intrusion is eventually traced back to natural causes.<ref name=\"melani\">{{cite web| author= Dr. Lillia Melani| title= Ann Radcliffe| url= http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/engl403-2.2-Ann-Radcliffe.pdf |accessdate=May 3, 2012 }}</ref> Radcliffe has been called both \u201cthe Great Enchantress\u201d and \u201cMother Radcliffe\u201d due to her influence on both Gothic literature and the female Gothic.<ref>KREMMEL, L.

Radcliffe's novels, above all ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794), were best-sellers. However, along with most novels at the time, they were looked down upon by many well-educated people as sensationalist nonsense.\n\nRadcliffe also inspired the emerging idea of \"Gothic feminism\", which she expressed through the ideology of \u2018female power through pretended and staged weakness\u2019. The establishment of this idea began the movement of the female gothic to be \"challenging\u2026 the concept of gender itself\".<ref name=\"Smith, Andrew 2004, pp. 1\">Smith, Andrew, and Diana Wallace. \"The Female Gothic: Then and Now.\" Gothic Studies, 25 Aug. 2004, pp. 1\u20137.</ref>\n\nRadcliffe also provided an aesthetic for the genre in an influential article \"On the Supernatural in Poetry\",<ref>''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'' 7, 1826, pp 145\u201352</ref> examining the distinction and correlation between horror and terror in Gothic fiction,<ref>Wright (2007) pp35-56</ref> utilizing the uncertainties of terror in her works to produce a model of the [[uncanny]].<ref>Smith, Andrew. \"Radcliffe's Aesthetics: Or, The Problem with Burke and Lewis.\" Women's Writing, vol. 22, no. 3, 2015, pp. 317-330.

The ''roman noir'' (\"black novel\") appeared in France, by such writers as [[Fran\u00e7ois Guillaume Ducray-Duminil]], [[Fran\u00e7ois-Thomas-Marie de Baculard d'Arnaud|Baculard d'Arnaud]] and [[St\u00e9phanie F\u00e9licit\u00e9, comtesse de Genlis|Madame de Genlis]]. In Germany, the ''Schauerroman'' (\"shudder novel\") gained traction with writers as [[Friedrich Schiller]], with novels like ''[[The Ghost-Seer]]'' (1789), and [[Christian Heinrich Spiess]], with novels like ''[[Das Peterm\u00e4nnchen]]'' (1791/92). These works were often more horrific and violent than the English Gothic novel.\n\n[[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]]' lurid tale of monastic debauchery, black magic and diabolism entitled ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796) offered the first continental novel to follow the conventions of the Gothic novel. Though Lewis's novel could be read as a pastiche of the emerging genre, self-parody had been a constituent part of the Gothic from the time of the genre's inception with Walpole's ''Otranto''. Lewis's portrayal of depraved monks, sadistic inquisitors and spectral nuns<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Monk|last=Lewis|first=Mathew|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=|location=London|pages=123\u2013125|orig-year=1796}}</ref>\u2014and his scurrilous view of the Catholic Church\u2014appalled some readers, but ''The Monk'' was important in the genre's development.\n\n''The Monk'' also influenced Ann Radcliffe in her last novel, ''[[The Italian (novel)|The Italian]]'' (1797). In this book, the hapless protagonists are ensnared in a web of deceit by a malignant monk called Schedoni and eventually dragged before the tribunals of the [[Inquisition]] in Rome, leading one contemporary to remark that if Radcliffe wished to transcend the horror of these scenes, she would have to visit hell itself.<ref>Birkhead (1921).</ref>\n\nThe [[Marquis de Sade]] used a subgothic framework for some of his fiction, notably ''[[Justine (Sade)|The Misfortunes of Virtue]]'' and ''Eugenie de Franval'', though the Marquis himself never thought of his like this. Sade critiqued the genre in the preface of his ''Reflections on the novel'' (1800) stating that the Gothic is \"the inevitable product of the revolutionary shock with which the whole of Europe resounded\". Contemporary critics of the genre also noted the correlation between the [[French Revolution]]ary [[Reign of Terror|Terror]] and the \"terrorist school\" of writing represented by Radcliffe and Lewis.<ref>Wright (2007) pp 57\u201373</ref> Sade considered ''The Monk'' to be superior to the work of Ann Radcliffe.\n\n== Germany ==\nGerman gothic fiction is usually described by the term ''Schauerroman'' (\"shudder novel\"). However, genres of ''Gespensterroman''/''Geisterroman'' (\"ghost novel\"), ''R\u00e4uberroman'' (\"robber novel\"), and ''Ritterroman'' (\"chivalry novel\") also frequently share plot and motifs with the British \"gothic novel\". As its name suggests, the ''R\u00e4uberroman'' focuses on the life and deeds of outlaws, influenced by [[Friedrich von Schiller]]'s drama ''The Robbers'' (1781). [[Heinrich Zschokke]]'s ''Ab\u00e4llino, der grosse Bandit'' (1793) was translated into English by [[M.G. Lewis]] as ''The Bravo of Venice'' in 1804. The ''Ritterroman'' focuses on the life and deeds of the knights and soldiers, but features many elements found in the gothic novel, such as magic, secret tribunals, and medieval setting. Benedikte Naubert's novel ''Hermann of Unna'' (1788) is seen as being very close to the ''Schauerroman'' genre.<ref>Cussack, Barry, p. 10-16</ref>\n\nWhile the term ''Schauerroman'' is sometimes equated with the term \"Gothic novel\", this is only partially true. Both genres are based on the terrifying side of the Middle Ages, and both frequently feature the same elements (castles, ghost, monster, etc.). However, ''Schauerroman''<nowiki/>'s key elements are necromancy and secret societies and it is remarkably more pessimistic than the British Gothic novel. All those elements are the basis for Friedrich von Schiller's unfinished novel ''[[The Ghost-Seer]]'' (1786\u20131789). The motive of secret societies is also present in the Karl Grosse's ''[[Horrid Mysteries]]'' (1791\u20131794) and [[Christian August Vulpius]]'s'' Rinaldo Rinaldini, the Robber Captain'' (1797).<ref>Cussack, Barry, p. 10-17</ref>\n\nOther early authors and works included [[Christian Heinrich Spiess]], with his works ''Das Peterm\u00e4nnchen'' (1793), ''Der alte \u00dcberall und Nirgends'' (1792), ''Die L\u00f6wenritter'' (1794), and ''Hans Heiling, vierter und letzter Regent der Erd- Luft- Feuer- und Wasser-Geister'' (1798); [[Heinrich von Kleist]]'s short story \"Das Bettelweib von Locarno\" (1797); and [[Ludwig Tieck]]'s ''Der blonde Eckbert'' (1797) and ''Der Runenberg'' (1804).<ref>Hogle, p. 65-69</ref> Early examples of female-authored Gothic include Sophie Albrecht's ''Das h\u00f6fliche Gespenst'' (1797) and ''Graum\u00e4nnchen oder die Burg Rabenb\u00fchl: eine Geistergeschichte altteutschen Ursprungs'' (1799).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Luly |first1=Sara |title=Polite Hauntings: Same-Sex Eroticism in Sophie Albrecht\u2019s Das h\u00f6fliche Gespenst |journal=Seminar: A Journal of Germanic Studies |date=2016 |volume=52 |issue=1 |doi=10.3138/seminar.2016.52.1.60}}</ref>\n\nDuring the next two decades, the most famous author of Gothic literature in Germany was polymath [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]. His novel ''[[The Devil's Elixirs]]'' (1815) was influenced by Lewis's novel ''[[The Monk]]'', and even mentions it during the book. The novel also explores the motive of [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], the term coined by another German author (and supporter of Hoffmann), [[Jean Paul]] in his humorous novel ''[[Siebenk\u00e4s]]'' (1796\u20131797). He also wrote an opera based on the [[Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9]]'s Gothic story ''[[Undine (novella)|Undine]]'', with de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9 himself writing the libretto.<ref>Hogle, p. 105-122</ref> Aside from Hoffmann and de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9, three other important authors from the era were [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] (''The Marble Statue'', 1819), [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]] (''Die Majoratsherren'', 1819), and [[Adelbert von Chamisso]] (''Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte'', 1814).<ref>Cussack, Barry, p. 91. 118\u2013123</ref>\n\nAfter them, [[Wilhelm Meinhold]] wrote ''[[The Amber Witch]]'' (1838) and ''[[Sidonia von Bork]]'' (1847). Also writing in the German language, [[Jeremias Gotthelf]] wrote ''[[The Black Spider]]'' (1842), an allegorical work that used Gothic themes. The last work from German writer [[Theodor Storm]], ''[[The Rider on the White Horse]]'' (1888), also uses Gothic motives and themes.<ref>Cussack, Barry, p. 26</ref> In the beginning of the 20th century, many German authors wrote works influenced by ''Schauerroman'', including [[Hanns Heinz Ewers]].<ref>Cussack, Barry, p. 23</ref>\n\n== Russian Empire ==\nRussian Gothic was not, until recently, viewed as a critical label by Russian critics. If used, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe (mostly early) works of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]. Most critics simply used the tags such as \"Romanticism\" and \"fantastique\". Even in relatively new story collection translated as Russian 19th-Century Gothic Tales (from 1984), the editor used the name ''\u0424\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438'' (The Fantastic World of Russian Romanticism Short Story/Novella).<ref>Cornwell (1999). Introduction</ref> However, since the mid-1980s, Russian gothic fiction was discussed in books like ''The Gothic-Fantastic in Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature'', ''European Gothic: A Spirited Exchange 1760\u20131960'', ''The Russian Gothic novel and its British antecedents'' and ''Goticheskiy roman v Rossii (Gothic Novel in Russia)''.\n\nThe first Russian author whose work can be described as gothic fiction is considered to be [[Nikolay Karamzin|Nikolay Mikhailovich Karamzin]]. Although many of his works feature gothic elements, the first one which is considered to belong purely in the \"gothic fiction\" label is ''Ostrov Borngolm'' (''Island of Bornholm'') from 1793.<ref>Cornwell (1999).

Some parts of Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov's \"[[A Hero of Our Time]]\" (1840) are also considered to belong in the gothic genre, but they lack the supernatural elements of the other Russian gothic stories.\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0438\u0439.jpg|thumb|upright|Viy, lord of the underworld, from the [[Viy (story)|story of the same name]] by Gogol]]\n\nThe key author of the transition from romanticism to realism, [[Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol]], is also one of the most important authors of the romanticism, and has produced a number of works which qualify as gothic fiction. His works include three short story collections, of which each one features a number of stories in the gothic genre, as well as many stories with gothic elements. The collections are: ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka]]'' (1831\u20131832) with the stories \"[[St John's Eve]]\" and \"[[A Terrible Vengeance]]\"; ''Arabesques'' (1835), with the story \"[[The Portrait (short story)|The Portrait]]\"; and ''[[Mirgorod]]'' (1835), with the story \"[[Viy (story)|Viy]]\". The last story is probably the most famous, having inspired at least eight movie adaptations (two of which are now considered to be lost), one animated movie, two documentaries, and a video game. Gogol's work is very different from western European gothic fiction, as he is influenced by Ukrainian folklore, Cossack lifestyle and, being a very religious man, Orthodox Christianity.<ref>Simpson, circa p. 21</ref><ref>Cornwell (1999). Neil Cornwell, p. 189-234</ref>\n\nOther authors of Gogol's era included [[Vladimir Fyodorovich Odoevsky]] (''The Living Corpse'', written 1838, published 1844; ''The Ghost''; ''The Sylphide''; and other stories), [[Count Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy]] (''The Family of the Vourdalak'', 1839, and ''The Vampire'', 1841), [[Mikhail Zagoskin]] (''Unexpected Guests''), [[J\u00f3zef S\u0119kowski]]/Osip Senkovsky (Antar), and [[Yevgeny Baratynsky]] (''The Ring'').<ref name=\"Horner 2002 p. 59-82\" />\n\nAfter Gogol, the Russian literature saw the rise of the realism, but many authors wrote stories belonging to the gothic fiction territory. [[Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev]], one of the world's most celebrated realists, wrote ''Faust'' (1856), ''Phantoms'' (1864), ''Song of the Triumphant Love'' (1881), and ''Clara Milich'' (1883). Another Russian realist classic, [[Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky]], incorporated gothic elements in many of his works, although none of his novels are seen as purely gothic.<ref>Cornwell (1999). p. 211-256</ref> [[Grigory Petrovich Danilevsky]], who wrote historical and early science fiction novels and stories, wrote ''Mertvec-ubiytsa'' (''Dead Murderer'') in 1879. Also, [[Grigori Machtet|Grigori Alexandrovich Machtet]] wrote the story \"Zaklyatiy kazak\".<ref name=\"Butuzov\">Butuzov</ref>\n\nDuring the last years of the [[Russian Empire]], in the early 20th century, many authors continued to write in the gothic fiction genre. These include historian and historical fiction writer [[Alexander Amfiteatrov|Alexander Valentinovich Amfiteatrov]]; [[Leonid Andreyev|Leonid Nikolaievich Andreyev]], who developed psychological characterization; symbolist [[Valery Yakovlevich Bryusov]]; [[Alexander Grin]]; [[Anton Pavlovich Chekhov]];<ref>Cornwell (1999). p. 257</ref> and [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Kuprin]].<ref name=\"Butuzov\" /> Nobel Prize winner [[Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin]] wrote ''[[Dry Valley (novel)|Dry Valley]]'' (1912), which is considered to be influenced by gothic literature.<ref>Peterson, p. 36</ref> In her monograph on the subject, Muireann Maguire writes, \"The centrality of the Gothic-fantastic to Russian fiction is almost impossible to exaggerate, and certainly exceptional in the context of world literature.\"<ref>Muireann Maguire, ''Stalin's Ghosts: Gothic Themes in Early Soviet Literature'' (Peter Lang Publishing, 2012; {{ISBN|3-0343-0787-X}}), p. 14.</ref>\n\n== Romantics ==\n[[File:Frontispiece to Frankenstein 1831.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus]]'' (1818) has come to define Gothic fiction in the Romantic period.

Prominent examples include [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' and ''[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]'' as well as [[John Keats]]' ''[[La Belle Dame sans Merci]]'' (1819) and ''[[Isabella, or the Pot of Basil]]'' (1820) which feature mysteriously fey ladies.<ref name=skarda>Skarda and Jaffe 1981: 33\u20135, 132\u20133</ref> In the latter poem the names of the characters, the dream visions and the macabre physical details are influenced by the novels of premiere Gothicist Ann Radcliffe.<ref name=skarda /> [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s first published work was the Gothic novel ''[[Zastrozzi]]'' (1810), about an outlaw obsessed with revenge against his father and half-brother. Shelley published a second Gothic novel in 1811, ''[[St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian]]'', about an alchemist who seeks to impart the secret of immortality.\n\nThe poetry, romantic adventures, and character of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron\u2014]]<nowiki/>characterised by his spurned lover [[Lady Caroline Lamb]] as \"mad, bad and dangerous to know\"\u2014were another inspiration for the Gothic, providing the archetype of the [[Byronic hero]]. Byron features, under the codename of \"[[Lord Ruthven (vampire)|Lord Ruthven]]\", in Lady Caroline's own Gothic novel: ''[[Glenarvon]]'' (1816).\n\nByron was also the host of the celebrated ghost-story competition involving himself, Percy Bysshe Shelley, [[Mary Shelley]], and [[John William Polidori]] at the Villa Diodati on the banks of [[Lake Geneva]] in the summer of 1816. This occasion was productive of both Mary Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818) and Polidori's ''[[The Vampyre]]'' (1819). This latter story revives Lamb's Byronic \"Lord Ruthven\", but this time as a vampire. ''The Vampyre'' has been accounted by cultural critic Christopher Frayling as one of the most influential works of fiction ever written and spawned a craze for [[Vampire literature|vampire fiction]] and theatre (and latterly film) which has not ceased to this day.<ref>{{cite book | last = Frayling | first =Christopher | authorlink =Christopher Frayling | title =Vampyres: Lord Byron to Count Dracula | publisher =Faber| date =1992| origyear=1978| location =London| isbn =978-0-571-16792-0 }}</ref> Mary Shelley's novel, though clearly influenced by the Gothic tradition, is often considered the first science fiction novel, despite the omission in the novel of any scientific explanation of the monster's animation and the focus instead on the moral issues and consequences of such a creation.\n\nA late example of traditional Gothic is ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'' (1820) by [[Charles Maturin]], which combines themes of anti-Catholicism with an outcast Byronic hero.<ref>Varma 1986</ref> [[Jane Loudon]]'s ''[[The Mummy!]]'' (1827) features standard Gothic motifs, characters, and plotting, but with one significant twist: it is set in the twenty-second century and speculates on fantastic scientific developments that might have occurred four hundred years in the future, thus making it one of the earliest examples, along with ''Frankenstein'', of the [[science fiction]] genre developing from Gothic traditions.<ref name=\"Hopkins\">[http://shura.shu.ac.uk/8710/3/Hopkins_Loudon_Mummy.pdf Lisa Hopkins, \"Jane C.

(Indeed, the form's popularity as an established genre had already begun to erode with the success of the historical romance popularised by Sir [[Walter Scott]].) However, in many ways, it was now entering its most creative phase. Recently readers and critics have begun to reconsider a number of previously overlooked Penny Blood or \"[[penny dreadful]]\" serial fictions by such authors as [[George W. M. Reynolds]] who wrote a trilogy of Gothic horror novels: ''Faust'' (1846), ''Wagner the Wehr-wolf'' (1847) and ''The Necromancer'' (1857).<ref>Baddeley (2002) pp143-4)</ref> Reynolds was also responsible for ''[[The Mysteries of London]]'' which has been accorded an important place in the development of the urban as a particularly Victorian Gothic setting, an area within which interesting links can be made with established readings of the work of Dickens and others. Another famous penny dreadful of this era was the anonymously authored ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' (1847). ''Varney'' is the tale of the [[vampire]] Sir Francis Varney, and introduced many of the [[trope (literature)|trope]]s present in [[vampire fiction]] recognizable to modern audiences \u2014 it was the first story to refer to sharpened teeth for a vampire.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-cronin/did-vampires-not-have-fan_b_8415636.html \"Did Vampires Not Have Fangs in Movies Until the 1950s?\"]. Huffington Post. Retrieved 27 September 2017</ref> The formal relationship between these fictions, serialised for predominantly working class audiences, and the roughly contemporaneous sensation fictions serialised in middle class periodicals is also an area worthy of inquiry.\n[[File:Edgar Allan Poe 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edgar Allan Poe]] was an important reinterpreter of Gothic fiction.]]\nAn important and innovative reinterpreter of the Gothic in this period was [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Poe focused less on the traditional elements of gothic stories and more on the psychology of his characters as they often descended into madness. Poe's critics complained about his \"German\" tales, to which he replied, 'that terror is not of Germany, but of the soul'. Poe, a critic himself, believed that terror was a legitimate literary subject. His story \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) explores these 'terrors of the soul' while revisiting classic Gothic tropes of aristocratic decay, death, and madness.<ref>(Skarda and Jaffe (1981) pp181-2</ref> The legendary villainy of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], previously explored by Gothicists Radcliffe, Lewis, and Maturin, is based on a true account of a survivor in \"[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]\" (1842). The influence of [[Ann Radcliffe]] is also detectable in Poe's \"[[The Oval Portrait]]\" (1842), including an honorary mention of her name in the text of the story.\n\nThe influence of Byronic Romanticism evident in Poe is also apparent in the work of the Bront\u00eb sisters. [[Emily Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' (1847) transports the Gothic to the forbidding Yorkshire Moors and features ghostly apparitions and a Byronic hero in the person of the demonic Heathcliff. The Bront\u00ebs' fiction is seen by some feminist critics as prime examples of Female Gothic, exploring woman's entrapment within domestic space and subjection to patriarchal authority and the transgressive and dangerous attempts to subvert and escape such restriction. Emily's Cathy and Charlotte Bront\u00eb's ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' are both examples of female protagonists in such a role.<ref>Jackson (1981) pp123-29)</ref> [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s Gothic potboiler, ''[[A Long Fatal Love Chase]]'' (written in 1866, but published in 1995) is also an interesting specimen of this subgenre.\n\n[[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s tales \"The Doom of the Griffiths\" (1858) \"Lois the Witch\", and \"The Grey Woman\" all employ one of the most common themes of Gothic fiction, the power of ancestral sins to curse future generations, or the fear that they will.\n[[File:Bram_Stoker_1906.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Bram Stoker]], author of ''[[Dracula]]'']]\nThe gloomy villain, forbidding mansion, and persecuted heroine of [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s ''[[Uncle Silas]]'' (1864) shows the direct influence of both Walpole's ''Otranto'' and Radcliffe's ''Udolpho''. Le Fanu's short story collection ''[[In a Glass Darkly]]'' (1872) includes the superlative vampire tale ''[[Carmilla]]'', which provided fresh blood for that particular strand of the Gothic and influenced [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[vampire]] novel ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897). According to literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]], Le Fanu, together with his predecessor Maturin and his successor Stoker, form a subgenre of Irish Gothic, whose stories, featuring castles set in a barren landscape, with a cast of remote aristocrats dominating an atavistic peasantry, represent in allegorical form the political plight of colonial Ireland subjected to the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].<ref>Eagleton, 1995.</ref>\n\nThe genre was also a heavy influence on more mainstream writers, such as [[Charles Dickens]], who read Gothic novels as a teenager and incorporated their gloomy atmosphere and melodrama into his own works, shifting them to a more modern period and an urban setting, including ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1837\u20138), ''[[Bleak House]]'' (1854) (Mighall 2003) and ''[[Great Expectations]]'' (1860\u201361). These pointed to the juxtaposition of wealthy, ordered and affluent civilisation next to the disorder and barbarity of the poor within the same metropolis. Bleak House in particular is credited with seeing the introduction of [[smog|urban fog]] to the novel, which would become a frequent characteristic of urban Gothic literature and film (Mighall 2007). His most explicitly Gothic work is his last novel, ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]],'' which he did not live to complete and which was published in unfinished state upon his death in 1870. The mood and themes of the Gothic novel held a particular fascination for the Victorians, with their morbid obsession with mourning rituals, [[Memento mori|mementos]], and mortality in general.\n\n[[File:Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde poster edit2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886) was a classic Gothic work of the 1880s, seeing many stage adaptations.]]\n\nThe 1880s saw the revival of the Gothic as a powerful literary form allied to [[fin de siecle]], which fictionalized contemporary fears like ethical degeneration and questioned the social structures of the time. Classic works of this [[Urban Gothic]] include [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886), [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1891), [[George du Maurier]]'s ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]'' (1894), [[Richard Marsh (author)|Richard Marsh]]'s ''[[The Beetle (novel)|The Beetle]]'' (1897), [[Henry James]]' ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' (1898), and the stories of [[Arthur Machen]]. Some of the works of Canadian writer [[Sir Gilbert Parker, 1st Baronet|Gilbert Parker]] also fall into the genre, including the stories in ''[[The Lane that Had No Turning, and Other Tales Concerning the People of Pontiac|The Lane that Had No Turning]]'' (1900).<ref>{{Cite book|title = \"Introduction\" to The Lane that Had No Turning, and Other Tales Concerning the People of Pontiac|last = Rubio|first = Jen|publisher = Rock's Mills Press|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-9881293-7-5|location = Oakville, ON|pages = vii - viii}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous Gothic villain ever, [[Count Dracula]], was created by [[Bram Stoker]] in his novel ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897). Stoker's book also established [[Transylvania in popular culture|Transylvania]] and Eastern Europe as the ''locus classicus'' of the Gothic.<ref>Mighall, 2003.</ref> [[Gaston Leroux]]'s serialized novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1909\u20131910) is another well-known example of gothic fiction from the early 20th century.\n\nIn America, two notable writers of the end of the 19th century, in the Gothic tradition, were [[Ambrose Bierce]] and [[Robert W. Chambers]]. Bierce's short stories were in the horrific and pessimistic tradition of Poe. Chambers, though, indulged in the decadent style of Wilde and Machen, even to the extent of his inclusion of a character named 'Wilde' in his ''[[The King in Yellow]].''\n\n== Precursors ==\nThe conventions of Gothic literature did not spring from nowhere into the mind of Horace Walpole. The components that would eventually combine into Gothic literature had a rich history by the time Walpole perpetrated his literary hoax in 1764.\n\n=== Mysterious imagination ===\nGothic literature is often described with words such as \"wonder\" and \"terror.\"<ref name=\"Terror and Wonder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/events/terror-and-wonder--the-gothic-imagination|title=Terror and Wonder the Gothic Imagination|website=The British Library|publisher=British Library|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref> This sense of wonder and terror, which provides the suspension of disbelief so important to the Gothic\u2014which, except for when it is parodied, even for all its occasional melodrama, is typically played straight, in a self-serious manner\u2014requires the imagination of the reader to be willing to accept the idea that there might be something \"beyond that which is immediately in front of us.\" The mysterious imagination necessary for Gothic literature to have gained any traction had been growing for some time before the advent of the Gothic. The necessity for this came as the known world was beginning to become more explored, reducing the inherent geographical mysteries of the world. The edges of the map were being filled in, and no one was finding any dragons. The human mind required a replacement.<ref name=\"Early and Pre-Gothic Literary Conventions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spookyscarysociety.com/2015/10/31/october-2015-literary-meeting-early-and-pre-gothic-literary-conventions-examples/|title=Early and Pre-Gothic Literary Conventions & Examples|date=31 October 2015|website=Spooky Scary Skeletons Literary and Horror Society|publisher=Spooky Scary Society|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref> Clive Bloom theorizes that this void in the collective imagination was critical in the development of the cultural possibility for the rise of the Gothic tradition.<ref name=\"Gothic Histories\">{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Clive|title=Gothic Histories: The Taste for Terror, 1764 to Present|date=2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=London|page=2}}</ref>\n\n=== Medievalism ===\nThe setting of most early Gothic works was a medieval one, but this had been a common theme long before Walpole. In Britain especially, there was a desire to reclaim a shared past. This obsession frequently led to extravagant architectural displays, and sometimes mock tournaments were held. It was not merely in literature that a medieval revival made itself felt, and this too contributed to a culture ready to accept a perceived medieval work in 1764.<ref name=\"Early and Pre-Gothic Literary Conventions\"/>\n\n=== Macabre and morbid ===\nThe Gothic often uses scenery of decay, death, and morbidity to achieve its effects (especially in the Italian Horror school of Gothic). However, Gothic literature was not the origin of this tradition; indeed it was far older. The corpses, skeletons, and churchyards so commonly associated with the early Gothic were popularized by the [[Graveyard poets|Graveyard Poets]], and were also present in novels such as [[Daniel Defoe|Daniel Defoe's]] [[Journal of the Plague Year]], which contains comical scenes of plague carts and piles of plague corpses. Even earlier, poets like [[Edmund Spenser]] evoked a dreary and sorrowful mood in such poems as [[Epithalamion (poem)|Epithalamion]].<ref name=\"Early and Pre-Gothic Literary Conventions\"/>\n\n=== Emotional aesthetic ===\nAll of the aspects of pre-Gothic literature mentioned above occur to some degree in the Gothic, but even taken together, they still fall short of true Gothic.<ref name=\"Early and Pre-Gothic Literary Conventions\"/> What was lacking was an aesthetic, which would serve to tie the elements together. Bloom notes that this aesthetic must take the form of a theoretical or philosophical core, which is necessary to \"sav[e] the best tales from becoming mere anecdote or incoherent sensationalism.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Clive|title=Gothic Histories: The Taste for Terror, 1764 to Present|date=2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=London|page=8}}</ref> In this particular case, the aesthetic needed to be an emotional one, which was finally provided by [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] 1757 work, [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|''A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful'']], which \"finally codif[ied] the gothic emotional experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spookyscarysociety.com/2015/10/31/october-2015-literary-meeting-early-and-pre-gothic-literary-conventions-examples/|title=Early and Pre-Gothic Literary Conventions & Examples|date=31 October 2016|website=Spooky Scary Skeletons Literary and Horror Society|publisher=Spooky Scary Society|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref> Specifically, Burke's thoughts on the Sublime, Terror, and Obscurity were most applicable. These sections can be summarized thus: the Sublime is that which is or produces the \"strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling,\"; the Sublime is most often evoked by Terror; and to cause Terror we need some amount of Obscurity\u2014we can't know everything about that which is inducing Terror\u2014or else \"a great deal of the apprehension vanishes\"; Obscurity is necessary in order to experience the Terror of the unknown.<ref name=\"Early and Pre-Gothic Literary Conventions\"/> Bloom asserts that Burke's descriptive vocabulary was essential to the Romantic works that eventually informed the Gothic.\n\n=== Political influences ===\nThe birth of the Gothic was thought to be influenced by political upheaval beginning. Researchers linked its birth with the English Civil War and culminating in a [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite]] rebellion (1745) more recent to the first Gothic novel (1764). A collective political memory and any deep cultural fears associated with it likely contributed to early Gothic villain characters as literary representatives of defeated [[Tory]] barons or [[Cavalier|Royalists]] \"rising\" from their political graves in the pages of the early Gothic to terrorize the bourgeois reader of late eighteenth-century England.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Radcliffe|first1=Ann|title=The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne|date=1995|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford|isbn=0192823574|pages=vii-xxiv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Alexandre-Garner|first1=Corinne|title=Borderlines and Borderlands:Confluences XXIV|date=2004|publisher=[[University of Paris]] X-Nanterre|location=Paris|isbn=2907335278|pages=205\u2013216}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cairney|first1=Christopher|title=The Villain Character in the Puritan World|date=1995|publisher=[[University of Missouri]]|location=Columbia|url=http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&res_dat=xri:pqdiss&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:9705216|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cairney |first1=Chris |title=Intertextuality and Intratextuality; Does Mary Shelley 'Sit Heavily Behind' Conrad's Heart of Darkness? |journal=Culture in Focus |date=2018 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=92 |url=https://www.mga.edu/culture-in-focus/docs/2018/Vol1-Issue1.pdf |accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Parody ==\nThe excesses, stereotypes, and frequent absurdities of the traditional Gothic made it rich territory for satire.<ref>Skarda 1986</ref> The most famous parody of the Gothic is [[Jane Austen]]'s novel ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (1818) in which the naive protagonist, after reading too much Gothic fiction, conceives herself a heroine of a Radcliffian romance and imagines murder and villainy on every side, though the truth turns out to be much more prosaic. Jane Austen's novel is valuable for including a list of early Gothic works since known as the [[Northanger Horrid Novels]]. These books, with their lurid titles, were once thought to be the creations of Jane Austen's imagination, though later research by [[Michael Sadleir]] and [[Montague Summers]] confirmed that they did actually exist and stimulated renewed interest in the Gothic. They are currently all being reprinted.<ref>Wright (2007) pp29-32).</ref>\n\nAnother example of Gothic parody in a similar vein is ''The Heroine'' by [[Eaton Stannard Barrett]] (1813). Cherry Wilkinson, a fatuous female protagonist with a history of novel-reading, fancies herself as the heroine of a Gothic romance. She perceives and models reality according to the stereotypes and typical plot structures of the Gothic novel, leading to a series of absurd events culminating in catastrophe. After her downfall, her affectations and excessive imaginations become eventually subdued by the voice of reason in the form of Stuart, a paternal figure, under whose guidance the protagonist receives a sound education and correction of her misguided taste.<ref>Skarda (1986)</ref>\n\n== Post-Victorian legacy ==\n\n=== Pulp ===\n[[File:Weird Tales March 1934.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pulp magazine]]s such as ''[[Weird Tales]]'' reprinted and popularized Gothic horror from the prior century.]]\n{{see also|Pulp magazine}}\nNotable English 20th-century writers in the Gothic tradition include [[Algernon Blackwood]], [[William Hope Hodgson]], [[M. R. James]], [[Hugh Walpole]], and [[Marjorie Bowen]]. In America [[pulp magazine]]s such as ''[[Weird Tales]]'' reprinted classic Gothic horror tales from the previous century, by such authors as Poe, [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], and Edward Bulwer-Lytton and printed new stories by modern authors featuring both traditional and new horrors.<ref>Goulart (1986)</ref> The most significant of these was [[H. P. Lovecraft]] who also wrote a conspectus of the Gothic and supernatural horror tradition in his ''[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]'' (1936) as well as developing a Mythos that would influence Gothic and contemporary horror well into the 21st century. Lovecraft's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Robert Bloch]], contributed to ''Weird Tales'' and penned ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1959), which drew on the classic interests of the genre. From these, the Gothic genre ''per se'' gave way to modern [[horror fiction]], regarded by some literary critics as a branch of the Gothic<ref>(Wisker (2005) pp232-33)</ref> although others use the term to cover the entire genre.\n\n=== New Gothic Romances ===\nGothic Romances of this description became popular during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, with authors such as [[Phyllis A. Whitney]], [[Joan Aiken]], [[Dorothy Eden]], [[Eleanor Hibbert|Victoria Holt]], [[Barbara Mertz|Barbara Michaels]], [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]], and Jill Tattersall. Many featured covers depicting a terror-stricken woman in diaphanous attire in front of a gloomy [[castle]], often with a single lit window. Many were published under the [[Paperback Library]] Gothic imprint and were marketed to a female audience. Though the authors were mostly women, some men wrote Gothic romances under female pseudonyms. For instance the prolific Clarissa Ross and Marilyn Ross were pseudonyms for the male writer [[Dan Ross (novelist)|Dan Ross]], and [[Frank Belknap Long]] published Gothics under his wife's name, Lyda Belknap Long. Another example is British writer [[Peter O'Donnell]], who wrote under the pseudonym Madeleine Brent. Outside of imprints like Love Spell, who discontinued publishing in 2010, very few books seem to be published using the term today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openlibrary.org/publishers/Love_Spell|title=Open Library On Internet Archive|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Southern Gothic ===\n{{main|Southern Gothic}}\nThe genre also influenced [[American literature|American writing]] to create the [[Southern Gothic]] genre, which combines some Gothic sensibilities (such as the [[grotesque]]) with the setting and style of the Southern United States. Examples include [[William Faulkner]], [[Eudora Welty]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Davis Grubb]], [[Anne Rice]] and [[Harper Lee]].<ref>Skarda and Jaffe (1981) pp418-56)</ref>\n\n=== Other contemporary Gothic ===\nContemporary American writers in this tradition include [[Joyce Carol Oates]], in such novels as ''[[Bellefleur]]'' and ''A Bloodsmoor Romance'' and short story collections such as ''Night-Side'' (Skarda 1986b) and [[Raymond Kennedy]] in his novel ''Lulu Incognito.''\n\nThe [[Southern Ontario Gothic]] applies a similar sensibility to a Canadian cultural context. [[Robertson Davies]], [[Alice Munro]], [[Barbara Gowdy]], [[Timothy Findley]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] have all produced works that are notable exemplars of this form.\n\nAnother writer in this tradition was [[Henry Farrell]], whose best-known work was the 1960 Hollywood horror novel ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (novel)|What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?]]'' Farrell's novels spawned a subgenre of \"Grande Dame Guignol\" in the cinema, represented by such films as [[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|the 1962 film based on Farrell's novel]], which starred [[Bette Davis]] versus [[Joan Crawford]]; this subgenre of films was dubbed the \"[[psycho-biddy]]\" genre.\n\n=== Modern horror ===\nMany modern writers of horror (or indeed other types of fiction) exhibit considerable Gothic sensibilities\u2014examples include the works of [[Anne Rice]], [[Stella Coulson]], [[Susan Hill]], [[Poppy Z. Brite]] and [[Neil Gaiman]] as well as some of the sensationalist works of [[Stephen King]]<ref>Skarda and Jaffe (1981) pp464-5, p478</ref><ref>Davenport-Hines (1998) pp357-8).</ref> [[Thomas M. Disch]]'s novel ''The Priest'' (1994) was subtitled\n''A Gothic Romance'', and was partly modelled on Matthew Lewis' ''The Monk''.<ref>Linda Parent Lesher,\n''The Best Novels of the Nineties: A Reader's Guide''. McFarland, 2000 \n{{ISBN|0-7864-0742-5}} (p. 267).</ref> \nMany of these writers, such as Poppy Z. Brite, Stephen King and particularly Clive Barker have focused on the surface of the body and the visuality of blood.<ref>Stephanou, Aspasia, Reading Vampire Gothic Through Blood (Palgrave, 2014)</ref>\nThe Romantic strand of Gothic was taken up in [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'' (1938) which is considered by some to be influenced by [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.<ref>Yardley, Jonathan (16 March 2004). \"Du Maurier's 'Rebecca,' A Worthy 'Eyre' Apparent\". The Washington Post.</ref> Other books by du Maurier, such as ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]'' (1936), also display Gothic tendencies. Du Maurier's work inspired a substantial body of \"female Gothics\", concerning heroines alternately swooning over or being terrified by scowling [[Byronic hero|Byronic men]] in possession of acres of prime real estate and the appertaining ''[[droit du seigneur]]''.\n{{For|modern horror associated with the goth scene|Goth subculture#Books and magazines}}\n\n=== In education ===\nEducators in literary, cultural, and architectural studies appreciate the Gothic as an area that facilitates the investigation of the beginnings of scientific certainty. As [[Carol Senf]] has stated, \"the Gothic was (...) a counterbalance produced by writers and thinkers who felt limited by such a confident worldview and recognized that the power of the past, the irrational, and the violent continue to hold sway in the world.\"<ref>Carol Senf, \"Why We Need the Gothic in a Technological World,\" in: ''Humanistic Perspectives in a Technological World'', ed. Richard Utz, Valerie B. Johnson, and Travis Denton (Atlanta: School of Literature, Media, and Communication, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2014), pp. 31\u201332.</ref> As such, the Gothic helps students better understand their own doubts about the self-assurance of today's scientists. Scotland is the location of what was probably the world\u00b4s first postgraduate program to exclusively consider the genre: the MLitt in the Gothic Imagination at the [[University of Stirling]], which first recruited in 1996.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=William|title=Historical Dictionary of Gothic Literature|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press}}</ref>\n\n=== Other media ===\nThe themes of the literary Gothic have been translated into other media. The early 1970s saw a Gothic Romance comic book mini-trend with such titles as [[DC Comics]]' ''[[The Dark Mansion Of Forbidden Love]]'' and ''[[The Sinister House of Secret Love]]'', [[Charlton Comics]]' ''[[Haunted Love]]'', [[Curtis Magazines]]' ''Gothic Tales of Love'', and [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics]]' [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] magazine ''Gothic Romances''.\n\nThere was a notable revival in 20th-century Gothic horror films such the classic [[Universal monsters]] films of the 1930s, [[Hammer Horror]] films, and [[Roger Corman]]'s [[Template:Cormanpoe|Poe cycle]].<ref>Davenport-Hines (1998) pp355-8)</ref> In [[Bollywood|Hindi cinema]], the Gothic tradition was combined with aspects of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]], particularly reincarnation, to give rise to an \"Indian Gothic\" genre, beginning with the films ''[[Mahal (1949 film)|Mahal]]'' (1949) and ''[[Madhumati]]'' (1958).<ref>{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=Vijay|title=Bollywood cinema: temples of desire|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2002|isbn=0-415-93014-6|pages=49\u201357|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Black Sabbath]]'s 1969 [[Black Sabbath (album)|debut album]] created a dark sound different from other bands at the time and has been called the first ever \"Goth-rock\" record.<ref>Baddeley (2002) p264</ref> Themes from Gothic writers such as [[H. P. Lovecraft]] were also used among [[gothic rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, especially in [[black metal]], [[thrash metal]] ([[Metallica]]'s ''The Call of Ktulu''), [[death metal]], and [[gothic metal]]. For example, heavy metal musician [[King Diamond]] delights in telling stories full of horror, theatricality, [[satanism]] and [[anti-Catholicism]] in his compositions.<ref>Baddeley (2002) p265</ref>\n\nVarious [[video games]] feature Gothic horror themes and plots. For example, the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series typically involves a hero of the Belmont lineage exploring a dark, old castle, fighting vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein's monster, and other Gothic monster staples, culminating in a battle against Dracula himself. Others, such as [[Ghosts'n Goblins]] feature a campier parody of Gothic fiction.\n\nIn [[role-playing games]] (RPG), the pioneering 1983 ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' adventure ''[[Ravenloft (module)|Ravenloft]]'' instructs the players to defeat the vampire [[Strahd von Zarovich]], who pines for his dead lover. It has been acclaimed as one of the best role-playing adventures of all time, and even inspired [[Ravenloft|an entire fictional world of the same name]]. \"[[World of Darkness]]\" is another RPG set in the real world, with the added element of the existence of a multitude of supernatural creatures such as the [[Werewolf]], [[Vampire]], and others. It contains sub-games, allowing you to play as a human, or as one of the inhuman creatures in the setting.\n\n== Elements of Gothic fiction ==\n* '''Virginal maiden''' \u2013 young, beautiful, pure, innocent, kind, virtuous and sensitive. Usually starts out with a mysterious past and it is later revealed that she is the daughter of an aristocratic or noble family.\n** Matilda in ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' \u2013 She is determined to give up Theodore, the love of her life, for her cousin's sake. Matilda always puts others first before herself, and always believes the best in others.\n** Adeline in ''[[The Romance of the Forest]]'' \u2013 \"Her wicked Marquis, having secretly immured Number One (his first wife), has now a new and beautiful wife, whose character, alas! Does not bear inspection.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lang|first=Andrew|title=Mrs. Radcliffe's Novels|journal=Cornhill Magazine|date=July 1900|issue=9:49}}</ref> As this review states, the virginal maiden character is above inspection because her personality is flawless. Hers is a virtuous character whose piety and unflinching optimism cause all to fall in love with her.\n* '''Older, foolish woman'''\n** Hippolita in ''The Castle of Otranto'' \u2013 Hippolita is depicted as the obedient wife of her tyrant husband who \"would not only acquiesce with patience to divorce, but would obey, if it was his pleasure, in endeavouring to persuade Isabelle to give him her hand\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Walpole|first=Horace|title=The Castle of Otranto|year=1764|publisher=Penguin}}</ref> This shows how weak women are portrayed as they are completely submissive, and in Hippolita's case, even support polygamy at the expense of her own marriage.<ref>{{cite web|title=How are Women Depicted and Treated in Gothic Novels|url=http://www.megaessays.com/viewpaper/29375.html}}</ref>\n** Madame LaMotte in ''The Romance of the Forest'' \u2013 naively assumes that her husband is having an affair with Adeline.

His figure was pleasing and majestic, but when angry, his eyes became so terrible that \"the wretch on whom it was fixed instantly fell backwards and sometimes expired\". He was addicted to women and pleasures of the flesh, so he ordered five palaces to be built: the five palaces of the senses. Although he was an eccentric man, learned in the ways of science, physics, and astrology, he loved his people. His main greed, however, was thirst for knowledge. He wanted to know everything. This is what led him on the road to damnation.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Melville|first=Lewis|title=Vathek|journal=Athenaeum|date=27 November 1909|issue=4283}}</ref>\n* '''Bandits/ruffians'''\n::They appear in several Gothic novels including ''The Romance of the Forest'' in which they kidnap Adeline from her father.\n\n* '''Clergy''' \u2013 always weak, usually evil\n** Father Jerome in ''The Castle of Otranto'' \u2013 Jerome, though not evil, is certainly weak as he gives up his son when he is born and leaves his lover.\n** Ambrosio in ''[[The Monk]]'' \u2013 Evil and weak, this character stoops to the lowest levels of corruption including rape and incest.\n** Mother Superior in ''The Romance of the Forest'' \u2013 Adeline fled from this convent because the sisters weren't allowed to see sunlight. Highly oppressive environment.\n* '''The setting'''\n::The plot is usually set in a castle, an abbey, a monastery, or some other, usually religious edifice, and it is acknowledged that this building has secrets of its own. This gloomy and frightening scenery sets the scene for what the audience has already come to expect. The importance of setting is noted in a London review of the ''Castle of Otranto'', \"He describes the country towards Otranto as desolate and bare, extensive downs covered with thyme, with occasionally the dwarf holly, the rosa marina, and lavender, stretch around like wild moorlands (...) Mr. Williams describes the celebrated Castle of Otranto as 'an imposing object of considerable size (...) has a dignified and chivalric air' (...) A fitter scene for his romance he probably could not have chosen.\" Similarly, De Vore states, \"The setting is greatly influential in Gothic novels. It not only evokes the atmosphere of horror and dread, but also portrays the deterioration of its world. The decaying, ruined scenery implies that at one time there was a thriving world. At one time the abbey, castle, or landscape was something treasured and appreciated. Now, all that lasts is the decaying shell of a once thriving dwelling.\"<ref name=\"De Vore\">{{cite web|last=De Vore |first=David |title=The Gothic Novel |url=http://cai.ucdavis.edu/waters-sites/gothicnovel/155breport.html |work=The Gothic Novel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313142647/http://cai.ucdavis.edu/waters-sites/gothicnovel/155breport.html |archivedate=2011-03-13 |df= }}</ref> Thus, without the decrepit backdrop to initiate the events, the Gothic novel would not exist.\n\nElements found especially in American Gothic fiction include:\n* '''Night journeys''' are a common element seen throughout Gothic literature. They can occur in almost any setting, but in [[American literature]] are more commonly seen in the wilderness, forest or any other area that is devoid of people.\n* '''Evil characters''' are also seen in Gothic literature and especially American Gothic. Depending on either the setting or the period from which the work came, the evil characters could be [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Animal trapping|trappers]], [[gold mine]]rs etc.\n* American Gothic novels also tend to deal with a \"[[Insanity|madness]]\" in one or more of the characters and carry that theme throughout the novel. In his novel ''[[Edgar Huntly or Memoirs of a Sleepwalker]]'', [[Charles Brockden Brown]] writes about two characters who slowly become more and more deranged as the novel progresses.\n* '''Miraculous survivals''' are elements within American Gothic literature in which a character or characters will somehow manage to survive some feat that should have led to their demise.\n* In American Gothic novels it is also typical that one or more of the characters will have some sort of [[supernatural]] powers. In Brown's ''Edgar Huntly or Memoirs of a Sleepwalker'', the main character, Huntly, is able to face and kill not one, but two [[panthera|panthers]].\n* An '''element of [[fear]]''' is another characteristic of American Gothic literature. This is typically connected to the unknown and is generally seen throughout the course of the entire novel. This can also be connected to the feeling of despair that characters within the novel are overcome by. This element can lead characters to commit heinous crimes. In the case of Brown's character Edgar Huntly, he experiences this element when he contemplates eating himself, eats an uncooked panther, and drinks his own [[sweat]]. The element of fear in female gothic is commonly portrayed through terror and supernatural fears, while the male gothic uses horror and physical fear and gore to create feelings of fear in the reader. \n* '''[[Psychological overlay]]''' is an element that is connected to how characters within an American Gothic novel are affected by things like the night and their surroundings. An example of this would be if a character was in a [[maze]]-like area and a connection was made to the maze that their minds represented.\n\n=== Role of architecture and setting in the Gothic novel ===\n[[File:Strawberryhill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill]], an English villa in the \"[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]]\" style, built by Gothic writer [[Horace Walpole]]]]\nGothic literature is intimately associated with the [[Gothic Revival architecture]] of the same era. In a way similar to the Gothic revivalists' rejection of the clarity and rationalism of the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightened]] Establishment, the literary Gothic embodies an appreciation of the joys of extreme emotion, the thrills of fearfulness and awe inherent in the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], and a quest for atmosphere.\n\nThe ruins of Gothic buildings gave rise to multiple linked emotions by representing the inevitable decay and collapse of human creations\u2014thus the urge to add fake ruins as eyecatchers in English landscape parks. English Gothic writers often associated medieval buildings with what they saw as a dark and terrifying period, characterized by harsh laws enforced by torture, and with mysterious, fantastic, and superstitious rituals. In literature such [[Anti-Catholicism]] had a European dimension featuring [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] institutions such as the Inquisition (in southern European countries such as Italy and Spain).\n\nJust as elements of Gothic architecture were borrowed during the Gothic Revival period in architecture, ideas about the Gothic period and Gothic period architecture were often used by Gothic novelists. Architecture itself played a role in the naming of Gothic novels, with many titles referring to castles or other common Gothic buildings. This naming was followed up with many Gothic novels often set in Gothic buildings, with the action taking place in castles, abbeys, convents and monasteries, many of them in ruins, evoking \"feelings of fear, surprise, confinement\". This setting of the novel, a castle or religious building, often one fallen into disrepair, was an essential element of the Gothic novel. Placing a story in a Gothic building served several purposes. It drew on feelings of awe, it implied the story was set in the past, it gave an impression of isolation or being cut off from the rest of the world and it drew on the religious associations of the Gothic style. This trend of using Gothic architecture began with ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' and was to become a major element of the genre from that point forward.<ref name=\"melani\" />\n\nBesides using Gothic architecture as a setting, with the aim of eliciting certain associations from the reader, there was an equally close association between the use of setting and the storylines of Gothic novels, with the architecture often serving as a mirror for the characters and the plot lines of the story.<ref>Bayer-Berenbaum, L. 1982. ''The Gothic Imagination: Expansion in Gothic Literature and Art''. Rutherford: [[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]].</ref> The buildings in the ''Castle of Otranto'', for example, are riddled with underground tunnels, which the characters use to move back and forth in secret. This secret movement mirrors one of the plots of the story, specifically the secrets surrounding Manfred's possession of the castle and how it came into his family.<ref>Walpole, H. 1764 (1968). ''The Castle of Otranto''. Reprinted in ''Three Gothic Novels''. London: Penguin Press</ref> The setting of the novel in a Gothic castle was meant to imply not only a story set in the past but one shrouded in darkness.\n\nIn [[William Thomas Beckford]]'s ''[[Vathek|The History of the Caliph Vathek]]'', architecture was used to both illustrate certain elements of Vathek's character and also warn about the dangers of over-reaching. Vathek's hedonism and devotion to the pursuit of pleasure are reflected in the pleasure wings he adds on to his castle, each with the express purpose of satisfying a different sense. He also builds a tall tower in order to further his quest for knowledge. This tower represents Vathek's pride and his desire for a power that is beyond the reach of humans. He is later warned that he must destroy the tower and return to Islam or else risk dire consequences. Vathek's pride wins out and, in the end, his quest for power and knowledge ends with him confined to Hell.<ref>Beckford, W. 1782 (1968). ''The History of the Caliph Vathek''. Reprinted in ''Three Gothic Novels''. London: Penguin Press.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Castle of Wolfenbach]]'' the castle that Matilda seeks refuge at while on the run is believed to be haunted. Matilda discovers it is not ghosts but the Countess of Wolfenbach who lives on the upper floors and who has been forced into hiding by her husband, the Count. Matilda's discovery of the Countess and her subsequent informing others of the Countess's presence destroys the Count's secret. Shortly after Matilda meets the Countess the Castle of Wolfenbach itself is destroyed in a fire, mirroring the destruction of the Count's attempts to keep his wife a secret and how his plots throughout the story eventually lead to his own destruction.<ref>Parsons, E. 1793 (2006). ''The Castle of Wolfenbach''. Chicago: Valencourt Press.</ref>\n\n[[File:Kenilworth Castle England.jpg|thumb|The picturesque and evocative ruin is a common theme in Gothic literature. This image shows the ruins of [[Kenilworth Castle]].]]\nThe major part of the action in the ''[[Romance of the Forest]]'' is set in an abandoned and ruined abbey and the building itself served as a moral lesson, as well as a major setting for and mirror of the action in the novel. The setting of the action in a ruined abbey, drawing on Burke's aesthetic theory of the [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|sublime and the beautiful]] established the location as a place of terror and of safety. Burke argued the sublime was a source of awe or fear brought about by strong emotions such as terror or mental pain. On the other end of the spectrum was the beautiful, which were those things that brought pleasure and safety. Burke argued that the sublime was the more preferred to the two. Related to the concepts of the sublime and the beautiful is the idea of the [[picturesque]], introduced by William Gilpin, which was thought to exist between the two other extremes. The picturesque was that which continued elements of both the sublime and the beautiful and can be thought of as a natural or uncultivated beauty, such as a beautiful ruin or a partially overgrown building. In ''Romance of the Forest'' Adeline and the La Mottes live in constant fear of discovery by either the police or Adeline's father and, at times, certain characters believe the castle to be haunted. On the other hand, the abbey also serves as a comfort, as it provides shelter and safety to the characters. Finally, it is picturesque, in that it was a ruin and serves as a combination of both the natural and the human. By setting the story in the ruined abbey, Radcliffe was able to use architecture to draw on the aesthetic theories of the time and set the tone of the story in the minds of the reader. As with many of the buildings in Gothic novels, the abbey also has a series of tunnels. These tunnels serve as both a hiding place for the characters and as a place of secrets. This was mirrored later in the novel with Adeline hiding from the Marquis de Montalt and the secrets of the Marquis, which would eventually lead to his downfall and Adeline's salvation.<ref name=\"Radcliffe, A 2009\">Radcliffe, A. 1791 (2009). ''The Romance of the Forest''. Chicago: Valencourt Press.</ref>\n\nArchitecture served as an additional character in many Gothic novels, bringing with it associations to the past and to secrets and, in many cases, moving the action along and foretelling future events in the story.\n\n=== Female Gothic and the supernatural explained ===\nCharacterized by its castles, dungeons, gloomy forests and hidden passages, from the Gothic novel genre emerged the Female Gothic. Guided by the works of authors such as [[Ann Radcliffe]], [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]], the Female Gothic permitted the introduction of feminine societal and sexual desires into Gothic texts.\n\nFemale gothic differs from the male gothic through differences in narrative technique, plot, assumptions of the supernatural, and the use of terror and horror. Female Gothic narratives focus on topics of the persecuted heroine in flight from a villainous father and in search of an absent mother, while male writers tended towards a plot of masculine transgression of social taboos. The emergence of the ghost story gave female writers something to write about besides the common marriage plot, allowing them to offer a more radical critique of male power, violence and predatory sexuality.<ref name=\"Smith, Andrew 2004, pp. 1\"/>\n\nIt has been said that medieval society, on which some Gothic texts are based, granted women writers the opportunity to attribute \"features of the mode [of Gothicism] as the result of the suppression of female sexuality, or else as a challenge to the gender hierarchy and values of a male-dominated culture\".<ref name=\"Abrams\">M.H. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'', Ninth Edition, Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2009.</ref>\n\nSignificantly, with the development of the Female Gothic came the literary technique of ''explaining the supernatural''. The Supernatural Explained \u2013 as this technique was aptly named \u2013 is a recurring plot device in Radcliffe's ''[[The Romance of the Forest]]''. The novel, published in 1791, is among Radcliffe's earlier works. The novel sets up suspense for horrific events, which all have natural explanations. However, the omission of any possible explanation based in reality is what instills a feeling of anxiety and terror in both character and reader.\n\nAn 18th-century response to the novel from the ''[[Monthly Review]]'' reads: \"We must hear no more of enchanted forests and castles, giants, dragons, walls of fire and other 'monstrous and prodigious things;'\u2014yet still forests and castles remain, and it is still within the province of fiction, without overstepping the limits of nature, to make use of them for the purpose of creating surprise.\"<ref name=\"Hookham\">Hookham \"The Romance of the Forest: interspersed with some Pieces of Poetry.\" ''Monthly Review'', p.82, May 1973.</ref>\n\nRadcliffe's use of Supernatural Explained is characteristic of the Gothic author. The female protagonists pursued in these texts are often caught in an unfamiliar and terrifying landscape, delivering higher degrees of terror. The end result, however, is the explained supernatural, rather than terrors familiar to women such as rape or incest, or the expected ghosts or haunted castles. The female gothic also discusses women\u2019s dissatisfactions with patriarchal society, addressing the problematic and dissatisfying maternal position and role within that society.<ref name=\"Smith, Andrew 2004, pp. 1\"/> Women's fears of entrapment within such elements as the domestic, the female body, marriage, childbirth, and domestic abuse are commonly portrayed through the female gothic. The female gothic formula is said to be \"a plot that resists an unhappy or ambiguous closure and explains the supernatural\".<ref name=\"Smith, Andrew 2004, pp. 1\"/>\n\nIn Radcliffe's ''The Romance of the Forest'', one may follow the female protagonist, Adeline, through the forest, hidden passages and abbey dungeons, \"without exclaiming, 'How these antique towers and vacant courts/ chill the suspended soul, till expectation wears the cast of fear!\"<ref name=\"Hookham\" />\n\nThe decision of Female Gothic writers to supplement true supernatural horrors with explained cause and effect transforms romantic plots and Gothic tales into common life and writing. Rather than establish the romantic plot in impossible events Radcliffe strays away from writing \"merely fables, which no stretch of fancy could realize.\"<ref name=\"Hay-Market\">Hay-Market's Belle Assemblee; or Court and fashionable magazine, p. 39, July 1809.</ref>\n\nEnglish scholar Chloe Chard's published introduction to ''The Romance of the Forest'' refers to the \"promised effect of terror\". The outcome, however, \"may prove less horrific than the novel has originally suggested\". Radcliffe sets up suspense throughout the course of the novel, insinuating a supernatural or superstitious cause to the mysterious and horrific occurrences of the plot. However, the suspense is relieved with the Supernatural Explained.\n\nFor example, Adeline is reading the illegible manuscripts she found in her bedchamber's secret passage in the abbey when she hears a chilling noise from beyond her doorway. She goes to sleep unsettled, only to awake and learn that what she assumed to be haunting spirits were actually the domestic voices of the servant, Peter. La Motte, her caretaker in the abbey, recognizes the heights to which her imagination reached after reading the autobiographical manuscripts of a past murdered man in the abbey.\n\n:\"'I do not wonder, that after you had suffered its terrors to impress your imagination, you fancied you saw specters, and heard wondrous noises.' La Motte said.\n:'God bless you! Ma'amselle,' said Peter.\n:'I'm sorry I frightened you so last night.'\n:'Frightened me,' said Adeline; 'how was you concerned in that?'\n\nHe then informed her, that when he thought Monsieur and Madame La Motte were asleep, he had stolen to her chamber door (...) that he had called several times as loudly as he dared, but receiving no answer, he believed she was asleep (...) This account of the voice she had heard relieved Adeline's spirits; she was even surprised she did not know it, till remembering the perturbation of her mind for some time preceding, this surprise disappeared.\"<ref name=\"Radcliffe\">Radcliffe ''The Romance of the Forest'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1986.</ref>\n\nWhile Adeline is alone in her characteristically Gothic chamber, she detects something supernatural, or mysterious about the setting. However, the \"actual sounds that she hears are accounted for by the efforts of the faithful servant to communicate with her, there is still a hint of supernatural in her dream, inspired, it would seem, by the fact that she is on the spot of her father's murder and that his unburied skeleton is concealed in the room next hers\".<ref name=\"McIntyre\">McIntyre \"Were the \"Gothic Novels\" Gothic?\" ''PMLA'', vol. 36, No. 4, 1921.</ref>\n\nThe supernatural here is indefinitely explained, but what remains is the \"tendency in the human mind to reach out beyond the tangible and the visible; and it is in depicting this mood of vague and half-defined emotion that Mrs. Radcliffe excels\".<ref name=\"McIntyre\" />\n\nTransmuting the Gothic novel into a comprehensible tale for the imaginative 18th-century woman was useful for the Female Gothic writers of the time. Novels were an experience for these women who had no outlet for a thrilling excursion. Sexual encounters and superstitious fantasies were idle elements of the imagination. However, the use of Female Gothic and Supernatural Explained, are a \"good example of how the formula [Gothic novel] changes to suit the interests and needs of its current readers\".\n\nIn many respects, the novel's \"current reader\" of the time was the woman who, even as she enjoyed such novels, would feel that she had to \"[lay] down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame,\"<ref name=\"Austen\">\"Austen's ''Northanger Abbey''\", Second Edition, Broadview, 2002.</ref> according to [[Jane Austen]], author of ''[[Northanger Abbey]]''. The Gothic novel shaped its form for female readers to \"turn to Gothic romances to find support for their own mixed feelings\".<ref name=\"Ronald\">Ronald \"Terror Gothic: Nightmare and Dream in Ann Radcliffe and Charlotte Bronte\", ''The Female Gothic'', Ed.

As female protagonists in novels like Adeline in ''The Romance of the Forest'' learn that their superstitious fantasies and terrors are replaced with natural cause and reasonable doubt, the reader may understand the true position of the heroine in the novel:\n\n\"The heroine possesses the romantic temperament that perceives strangeness where others see none. Her sensibility, therefore, prevents her from knowing that her true plight is her condition, the disability of being female.\"<ref name=\"Nichols\" />\n\nAnother text in which the heroine of the Gothic novel encounters the Supernatural Explained is ''The Castle of Wolfenbach'' (1793) by Gothic author Eliza Parsons. This Female Gothic text by Parsons is listed as one of Catherine Morland's Gothic texts in Austen's ''Northanger Abbey''. The heroine in ''The Castle of Wolfenbach'', Matilda, seeks refuge after overhearing a conversation in which her Uncle Weimar speaks of plans to rape her. Matilda finds asylum in the Castle of Wolfenbach: a castle inhabited by old married caretakers who claim that the second floor is haunted. Matilda, being the courageous heroine, decides to explore the mysterious wing of the Castle.\n\nBertha, wife of Joseph (caretakers of the castle) tells Matilda of the \"other wing\": \"Now for goodness sake, dear madam, don't go no farther, for as sure as you are alive, here the ghosts live, for Joseph says he often sees lights and hears strange things.\"<ref name=\"Parsons\">Parsons. ''The Castle of Wolfenbach'', [[Valancourt Books]], Kansas City, 2007.</ref>\n\nHowever, as Matilda ventures through the castle, she finds that the wing is not haunted by ghosts and rattling chains, but rather, the Countess of Wolfenbach. The supernatural is explained, in this case, ten pages into the novel, and the natural cause of the superstitious noises is a Countess in distress. Characteristic of the Female Gothic, the natural cause of terror is not the supernatural, but rather female disability and societal horrors: rape, incest and the threatening control of the male antagonist.\n\n==Gothic subgenres: the \"ecogothic\"==\n\nThere are many Gothic subgenres, including a newly-minted \"environmental gothic\" or \"ecogothic\".<ref>[https://perditanovel.com/the-eco-gothic-2/]</ref><ref>Hillard, Tom. \u201cDeep Into That Darkness Peering\u201d: An Essay on Gothic Nature.

AD 66\u201370,{{sfn|Perkins|1998|p=241}} [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] around AD 85\u201390,{{sfn|Reddish|2011|pp=108, 144}} and [[Gospel of John|John]] AD 90\u2013110.{{sfn|Lincoln|2005|p=18}} Despite the traditional ascriptions, all four are anonymous, and none were written by eyewitnesses.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=42}}\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Jesus' death his followers expected him to return at any moment, certainly within their own lifetimes, and in consequence there was little motivation to write anything down for future generations, but as eyewitnesses began to die, and as the missionary needs of the church grew, there was an increasing demand and need for written versions of the founder's life and teachings.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=17}} The stages of this process can be summarised as follows:{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=124\u201325}}\n* Oral traditions \u2014 stories and sayings passed on largely as separate self-contained units, not in any order;\n* Written collections of miracle stories, parables, sayings, etc., with oral tradition continuing alongside these;\n* Written proto-gospels preceding and serving as sources for the gospels \u2014 the dedicatory preface of Luke, for example, testifies to the existence of previous accounts of the life of Jesus.{{sfn|Martens|2004|p=100}}\n* Gospels formed by combining proto-gospels, written collections and still-current oral tradition.\n\nMark, the first gospel to be written, uses a variety of sources, including conflict stories (Mark 2:1\u20133:6), [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] discourse (4:1\u201335), and collections of sayings, although not the sayings gospel known as the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and probably not the [[Q source]] used by Matthew and Luke.{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=13\u201314}} The authors of Matthew and Luke, acting independently, used Mark for their narrative of Jesus's career, supplementing it with the collection of sayings called the [[Q document]] and additional material unique to each called the [[M source]] (Matthew) and the [[L source]] (Luke).{{sfn|Levine|2009|p=6}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Markan priority\">The priority of Mark is accepted by most scholars, but there are important dissenting opinions: see the article [[Synoptic problem]].</ref> Mark, Matthew and Luke are called the [[synoptic gospels]] because of the close similarities between them in terms of content, arrangement, and language.{{sfn|Goodacre|2001|p=1}} The authors and editors of John may have known the synoptics, but did not use them in the way that Matthew and Luke used Mark.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=unpaginated}} There is a near-consensus that this gospel had its origins as a \"signs\" source (or gospel) that circulated within the [[Johannine literature|Johannine community]] (the community that produced John and the three epistles associated with the name), later expanded with a Passion narrative and a series of discourses.{{sfn|Burge|2014|p=309}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"John\">The debate over the composition of John is too complex to be treated adequately in a single paragraph; for a more nuanced view see Aune's entry  on the Gospel of John in the \"Westminster Dictionary of New Testament and Early Christian Literature\", pages 243-245.</ref>\n\nAll four also use the Jewish scriptures, by quoting or referencing passages, or by interpreting texts, or by alluding to or echoing biblical themes.{{sfn|Allen|2013|p=43-44}} Such use can be extensive: Mark's description of the [[Parousia]] (second coming) is made up almost entirely of quotations from scripture.{{sfn|Edwards|2002|p=403}} Matthew is full of quotations and [[allusion]]s,{{sfn|Beaton|2005|p=122}} and although John uses scripture in a far less explicit manner, its influence is still pervasive.{{sfn|Lieu|2005|p=175}} Their source was the Greek version of the scriptures, called the [[Septuagint]] \u2013 they do not seem familiar with the original Hebrew.{{sfn|Allen|2013|p=45}}\n\n===Contents===\nThe gospels are memories of the deeds and words of Jesus.{{sfn|Johnson|2010|p=23}} The four narratives share a story in which the earthly career of Jesus culminates in his death and resurrection, an event of crucial redemptive significance.{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|p=587}} The four are [[Internal consistency of the Bible#Gospels|inconsistent in detail]].{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|p=215}} John and the three synoptics relate the same basic story-line, but within this overall framework they present completely different pictures of Jesus' career.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=217}} John has no [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]], no [[temptation of Christ|temptation]], no [[transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], and lacks the [[Lord's Supper]] and stories of Jesus' ancestry, birth, and childhood.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=217}} Jesus's career in the synoptics takes up a single year while in John it takes three, with the [[cleansing of the Temple]] at the beginning of his ministry while in the synoptics it happens at the end, and in the synoptics the [[Last Supper]] takes place as a Passover meal, while in John it happens on the day before Passover.{{sfn|Anderson|2011|p=52}} \n\nMark, the first gospel, never calls Jesus \"God\" or claims that Jesus existed prior to his earthly life, never mentions a virgin birth (the author apparently believes that Jesus had a normal human parentage and birth), and makes no attempt to trace Jesus' ancestry back to [[King David]] or [[Adam]].{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=158}} Crucially, Mark originally had no [[post-resurrection appearances of Jesus]],{{sfn|Parker|1997|p=125}} although Mark 16:7, in which the young man discovered in the tomb instructs the women to tell \"the disciples and Peter\" that Jesus will see them again in Galilee, hints that the author may have known of the tradition.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=149}} Matthew reinterprets Mark,{{sfn|Beaton|2005|p=117}} stressing Jesus' teachings as much as his acts,{{sfn|Morris|1986|p=114}} and making subtle changes to the narrative in order to stress his divine nature \u2013 Mark's \"young man\" who appears at Jesus' tomb, for example, becomes a radiant angel in Matthew.{{sfn|Beaton|2005|p=123}} The miracle stories in Mark confirm Jesus' status as an emissary of God (which was Mark's understanding of the Messiah), but in Matthew they demonstrate his divinity.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=59}} Luke, while following Mark's plot more faithfully than does Matthew, has expanded on the source, corrected Mark's grammar and syntax, and eliminated some passages entirely, notably most of chapters 6 and 7, which he apparently felt reflected poorly on the disciples and painted Jesus too much like a magician.{{sfn|Johnson|2010|p=48}}\n\nThe synoptic gospels represent Jesus as an [[exorcist]] and healer who preached in parables about the coming [[Kingdom of God]]. He preached first in Galilee and later in Jerusalem, where [[Jesus and the money changers|he cleansed the temple]]. He states that he offers no sign as proof (Mark) or only the sign of Jonah (Matthew and Luke).<ref name = \"5G\">[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar.

He performs several miracles as signs, most of them not found in the synoptics. The Gospel of John ends:(21:25) \"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.\"\n\n==Genre and reliability==\nThe consensus among modern scholars is that the gospels belong to the ancient genre of ''bios'', or [[biography]].{{sfn|Lincoln|2004|p=133}} Ancient biographies were concerned with providing examples for readers to emulate while preserving and promoting the subject's reputation and memory, and so they included both [[propaganda]] and ''[[kerygma]]'' (preaching) in their works.{{sfn|Dunn|2005|p=174}} Mark, for example, is not biography in the modern sense but an [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] history depicting Jesus caught up in events at the end of time.{{sfn|Donahue|2005|p=15}} Despite this, scholars are confident that the gospels do provide a good idea of the public career of Jesus, and that critical study can attempt to distinguish the ideas of Jesus from those of later authors and editors.{{sfn|Sanders|1995|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nAs Luke's attempt to link the birth of Jesus to the [[census of Quirinius]] demonstrates, there is no guarantee that the gospels are historically accurate.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|pp=21\u201322}} Matthew and Luke have frequently edited Mark to suit their own ends, and the contradictions and discrepancies between John and the synoptics make it impossible to accept both as reliable.{{sfn|Tuckett|2000|p=523}}  In addition the gospels we read today have been edited and corrupted over time, leading [[Origen]] to complain in the 3rd century that \"the differences among manuscripts have become great, ... [because copyists] either neglect to check over what they have transcribed, or, in the process of checking, they make additions or deletions as they please.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|p=7,52}} For these reasons modern scholars are cautious of relying on the gospels uncritically, but nevertheless they do provide a good idea of the public career of Jesus, and critical study can attempt to distinguish the original ideas of Jesus from those of the later authors.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|pp=21\u201322}}{{sfn|Sanders|1995|pp=4\u20135}}\n\n==Canonisation and the non-canonical gospels==\n{{Main|Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament apocrypha}}{{Further|Gnostic gospels}}\n\n===Canonisation===\nThe creation of a Christian canon was probably a response to the career of the heretic [[Marcion]] (c. 85\u2013160), who established a canon of his own with just one gospel, the gospel of Luke, which he edited to fit his own theology.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|p=34}} The [[Muratorian canon]], the earliest surviving list of books considered (by its own author at least) to form Christian scripture, included Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] went further, stating that there must be four gospels and only four because there were four corners of the Earth and thus the Church should have four pillars.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=697}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|p=35}}\n\n===Non-canonical gospels===\n[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], [[Jerome]] and other early church fathers preserve in their writings citations from [[Jewish-Christian gospels]]. Most modern critical scholars consider that the extant citations suggest at least two and probably three distinct works, at least one of which (possibly two) closely parallels the Gospel of Matthew.<ref>[[Philipp Vielhauer]] in [[Schneemelcher]]'s ''New Testament Apocrypha'' Vol.1 (1971) English revised edition R.

Cross, F. L., ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref> It is a narrative gospel and is notable for asserting that [[Herod Antipas|Herod]], not [[Pontius Pilate]], ordered the crucifixion of Jesus. It had been lost but was rediscovered in the 19th century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe [[Gospel of Judas]] is another controversial and ancient text that purports to tell the story of the gospel from the perspective of Judas, the disciple who is usually said to have betrayed Jesus. It paints an unusual picture of the relationship between Jesus and Judas, in that it appears to interpret Judas's act not as betrayal, but rather as an act of obedience to the instructions of Jesus. The text was recovered from a cave in Egypt by a thief and thereafter sold on the black market until it was finally discovered by a collector who, with the help of academics from Yale and Princeton, was able to verify its authenticity. The document itself does not claim to have been authored by Judas (it is, rather, a gospel about Judas), and is known to date to at least 180 AD.<ref>Achtemeier, Paul J., Th.D., Harper's Bible Dictionary, (San Francisco: Harper and Row, Publishers, Inc.; 1985).</ref>\n\nThe [[Gospel of Mary]] was originally written in Greek during the 2nd century. It is often interpreted as a Gnostic text. It consists mainly of dialog between [[Mary Magdalene]] and the other disciples. It is typically not considered a gospel by scholars since it does not focus on the life of Jesus.<ref>Andrew E. Bernhard, ''Other Early Christian Gospels: A Critical Edition of the Surviving Greek Manuscripts'', Library of New Testament Studies 315 (London-New York: T & T Clark, 2006), p. 2. {{ISBN|0-567-04204-9}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Gospel of Barnabas]] was a gospel which is claimed to be written by [[Barnabas]], one of the [[apostles]]. It contradicts the ministry of Jesus in cannonical New Testament, but has clear parallels with the Islamic faith, by mentioning Muhammad as Messenger of God. It also strongly deny [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline]] doctrine, and Jesus testified himself as a prophet, not the son of God.<ref>Wiegers, G. (1995). \"''Muhammad as the Messiah: A comparison of the polemical works of Juan Alonso with the Gospel of Barnabas''\". Biblitheca Orientalis</ref>\n\n[[Marcion of Sinope]], c. 150, had a much shorter version of the gospel of Luke, differing substantially from what has now become the standard text of the gospel and far less oriented towards the Jewish scriptures. Marcion is said to have rejected all other gospels, including those of Matthew, Mark and especially John, which he allegedly rejected as having been forged by [[Irenaeus]]. Marcion's critics alleged that he had edited out the portions he did not like from the then canonical version, though Marcion is said to have argued that his text was the more genuinely original one.\n\nA genre of \"[[Infancy gospels]]\" (Greek: ''protoevangelion'') arose in the 2nd century, and includes the [[Gospel of James]], which introduces the concept of the [[Perpetual Virginity]] of Mary, and the [[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]] (not to be confused with the absolutely different sayings [[Gospel of Thomas]]), both of which related many miraculous incidents from the life of Mary and the childhood of Jesus that are not included in the canonical gospels.\n\nAnother genre is that of the [[Gospel harmony|gospel harmony]], in which the four canonical gospels are combined into a single narrative, either to present a consistent text or to produce a more accessible account of Jesus' life. The oldest known harmony, the ''[[Diatessaron]]'', was compiled by [[Tatian]] around 175, and may have been intended to replace the separate gospels as an authoritative text. It was accepted for liturgical purposes for as much as two centuries in [[Syria]], but eventually developed a reputation as being heretical and was suppressed. Subsequent harmonies were written with the more limited aim of being study guides or explanatory texts. They still use all the words and only the words of the four gospels, but the possibility of editorial error, and the loss of the individual viewpoints of the separate gospels, keeps the harmony from being canonical.<ref>The church has made a point of supporting four separate gospels, \"equally authoritative and worth preserving as distinct witnesses.\"  Gabel at 210.

After a source code release installers and packages are made for different operating systems by parties who might not be in contact with the maintainers of GIMP.\n\nThe [[Software versioning|version number]] used in GIMP is expressed in a ''major-minor-micro'' format, with each number carrying a specific meaning: the first (major) number is incremented only for major developments (and is currently 2). The second (minor) number is incremented with each release of new features, with odd numbers reserved for in-progress development versions and even numbers assigned to stable releases; the third (micro) number is incremented before and after each release (resulting in even numbers for releases, and odd numbers for development snapshots) with any bug fixes subsequently applied and released for a stable version.\n\nEach year GIMP applies for several positions in the [[Google Summer of Code]] (GSoC);<ref name=\"gimp-gsoc\">{{cite web| title=SummerOfCode \u2014 Wilber's Wiki| url=http://wiki.gimp.org/gimp/SummerOfCode| date=30 April 2009| work=Wilber's Wiki| publisher=GIMP developers| accessdate=30 June 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827115720/http://wiki.gimp.org/gimp/SummerOfCode| archivedate=27 August 2009| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"gsoc-gimp-2009\">{{cite web| title=GNU Image Manipulation Program| url=https://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/gimp| year=2009| work=Google Summer of Code 2009| publisher=Google| accessdate=30 June 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423053949/http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/gimp| archivedate=23 April 2009| df=dmy-all}}</ref> to date GIMP has participated in all years except 2007.<ref name=\"list-gimpdev-2007gsoc\">{{cite web | url=http://www.mail-archive.com/gimp-developer@lists.xcf.berkeley.edu/msg12888.html | title=GSoc 2007 \u2013 we didn't make it\u2026 | publisher=The Mail Archive | work=GIMP Developer mailing list | date=15 March 2007 | accessdate=21 December 2013 | first=Michael | last=Schumacher}}</ref> From 2006 to 2009 there have been nine GSoC projects that have been listed as successful,<ref name=\"gimp-gsoc\" /> although not all successful projects have been merged into GIMP immediately.

They include filters and brushes, as well as transformation, selection, [[Layers (digital image editing)|layer]] and masking tools.\n\n'''Color'''\nThere are several ways of selecting colors, including palettes, color choosers and using an eyedropper tool to select a colour on the canvas. The built-in color choosers include [[RGB color model|RGB]]/[[HSL and HSV|HSV]] selector or scales, water-color selector, [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] selector and a color-wheel selector. Colors can also be selected using hexadecimal color codes as used in HTML color selection. GIMP has native support for indexed colour and [[RGB color model|RGB]] color spaces; other color spaces are supported using decomposition where each channel of the new color space becomes a black-and-white image. CMYK, [[Lab color space|LAB]] and [[HSL and HSV|HSV]] ([[hue]], [[colorfulness|saturation]], [[Lightness|value]]) are supported this way.<ref>{{cite web |first=Yoshinori |last=Yamakawa |title=Separate+ |url=http://cue.yellowmagic.info/softwares/separate.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107080439/http://cue.yellowmagic.info/softwares/separate.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 January 2007 |date=6 January 2007 |publisher=cue.yellowmagic.info |accessdate=2 July 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Decompose |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/plug-in-decompose-registered.html |work=GIMP user manual |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> Color blending can be achieved using the Blend tool, by applying a [[Image gradient|gradient]] to the surface of an image and using GIMP's color modes. Gradients are also integrated into tools such as the brush tool, when the user paints this way the output color slowly changes. There are a number of default gradients included with GIMP; a user can also create custom gradients with tools provided. Gradient plug-ins are also available.\n\n'''Selections and paths'''\nGIMP [[selection (user interface)|selection]] tools include a rectangular and circular selection tool, free select tool, and fuzzy select tool (also known as magic wand). More advanced selection tools include the select by color tool for selecting contiguous regions of color\u2014and the scissors select tool, which creates selections semi-automatically between areas of highly contrasting colors. GIMP also supports a quick mask mode where a user can use a brush to paint the area of a selection.  Visibly this looks like a red colored overlay being added or removed. The foreground select tool is an implementation of [[Simple interactive object extraction|Simple Interactive Object Extraction]] (SIOX) a method used to perform the extraction of foreground elements, such as a person or a tree in focus. The Paths Tool allows a user to create vectors (also known as [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s). Users can use paths to create complex selections, including around natural curves. They can paint (or \"stroke\") the paths with brushes, patterns, or various line styles. Users can name and save paths for reuse.\n\n'''Image editing'''\nThere are many tools that can be used for [[Image editing|editing images]] in GIMP. The more common tools include a paint brush, pencil, airbrush, eraser and ink tools used to create new or blended pixels. The Bucket Fill tool can be used to fill a selection with a color or pattern. The Blend tool can be used to fill a selection with a color gradient. These color transitions can be applied to large regions or smaller custom path selections.\n\nGIMP also provides \"smart\" tools that use a more complex algorithm to do things that otherwise would be time consuming or impossible. These include:\n* Clone tool, which copies pixels using a brush\n* Healing brush, which copies pixels from an area and corrects tone and color\n* Perspective clone tool, which works like the clone tool but corrects for distance changes\n* Blur and sharpen tool blurs and sharpens using a brush\n* The Smudge tool can be used to subtly smear a selection where it stands.\n* Dodge and burn tool is a brush that makes target pixels lighter (dodges) or darker (burns)\n[[File:Cycle of layers channels paths in gimp-2.8.gif|thumb|Animation showing three docked and tabbed dialogs: layers, channels, and paths.]]\n\n'''Layers, layer masks and channels'''\nAn image being edited in GIMP can consist of many [[Layers (digital image editing)|layers]] in a stack. The user manual suggests that \"A good way to visualize a GIMP image is as a stack of transparencies,\" where in GIMP terminology, each transparency is a layer.<ref>{{cite web |title=Introduction to layers |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-image-combining.html#gimp-concepts-layers |work=GIMP user manual |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> Each layer in an image is made up of several channels. In an [[RGB color model|RGB]] image, there are normally 3 or 4 channels, each consisting of a red, green and blue channel. Color sublayers look like slightly different gray images, but when put together they make a complete image. The fourth channel that may be part of a layer is the [[Alpha compositing|alpha channel]] (or layer mask). This channel measures opacity where a whole or part of an image can be completely visible, partially visible or invisible. Each layer has a layer mode that can be set to change the colors in the image.<ref>{{cite web |title=Layer Modes |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-image-combining.html#gimp-concepts-layers |work=GIMP user manual |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nText layers can be created using the text tool, allowing a user to write on an image.

Animations are created either by placing each frame on its own layer (in other words, treating each layer as an animation cel), or by manipulating each numbered file as if it were a frame in the video: moving, rotating, flipping, changing colors, applying filters, etc. to the layers by taking advantage of interpolation within function calls(plug-in usage), within a specified frame range. The resulting project can be saved as an animated GIF or encoded video file. GAP also provides programmed layer transitions, frame rate change, and move paths, allowing the creation of sophisticated animations.\n\n'''GIMP Paint Studio (GPS)'''\nA collection of brushes and accompanying tool presets, aimed at artists and graphic designers.

Such algorithms take into account not only the light that comes directly from a light source (''direct illumination''), but also subsequent cases in which light rays from the same source are reflected by other surfaces in the scene, whether reflective or not (''indirect illumination'').\n\nTheoretically, reflections, refractions, and shadows are all examples of global illumination, because when simulating them, one object affects the rendering of another (as opposed to an object being affected only by a direct light). In practice, however, only the simulation of [[diffuse inter-reflection]] or [[Caustic (optics)|caustics]] is called global illumination.\n\n==Algorithms==\nImages rendered using global illumination algorithms often appear more photorealistic than those using only direct illumination algorithms. However, such images are computationally more expensive and consequently much slower to generate. One common approach is to compute the global illumination of a scene and store that information with the geometry (e.g., radiosity). The stored data can then be used to generate images from different viewpoints for generating walkthroughs of a scene without having to go through expensive lighting calculations repeatedly.\n\n[[Radiosity (computer graphics)|Radiosity]], [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], [[beam tracing]], [[cone tracing]], [[path tracing]], [[Metropolis light transport]], [[ambient occlusion]], [[photon mapping]], and [[image based lighting]] are all examples of algorithms used in global illumination, some of which may be used together to yield results that are not fast, but accurate.\n\nThese algorithms model [[diffuse inter-reflection]] which is a very important part of global illumination; however most of these (excluding radiosity) also model [[specular reflection]], which makes them more accurate algorithms to solve the lighting equation and provide a more realistically illuminated scene.  The algorithms used to calculate the distribution of light energy between surfaces of a scene are closely related to [[heat transfer]] simulations performed using [[Finite element analysis|finite-element]] methods in engineering design.\n\n==Photorealism==\n[[File:Alexexterior2.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior view of an architectural model]]\n[[File:Show how 3D real time ambient occlusion works 2013-11-23 10-45.jpeg|thumb|upright|Example of an ambient occlusion layer]]\nAchieving accurate computation of global illumination in real-time remains difficult.<ref name=\"tmocg\">{{cite book |title=The Magic of Computer Graphics |last=Kurachi |first=Noriko |year=2011 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781439873571 |page=339 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YjLOBQAAQBAJ |accessdate=24 September 2017}}</ref>  In real-time 3D graphics, the [[diffuse inter-reflection]] component of global illumination is sometimes approximated by an \"ambient\" term in the lighting equation, which is also called \"ambient lighting\" or \"ambient color\" in 3D software packages. Though this method of approximation (also known as a \"cheat\" because it's not really a global illumination method) is easy to perform computationally, when used alone it does not provide an adequately realistic effect. Ambient lighting is known to \"flatten\" shadows in 3D scenes, making the overall visual effect more bland. However, used properly, ambient lighting can be an efficient way to make up for a lack of processing power.\n\n== Procedure ==\nMore and more specialized algorithms are used in 3D programs that can effectively simulate the global illumination. These algorithms are numerical approximations to the [[rendering equation]]. Well known algorithms for computing global illumination include [[path tracing]], [[photon mapping]] and [[Radiosity (computer graphics)|radiosity]].\nThe following approaches can be distinguished here:\n* Inversion: <math>L = (1-T)^{-1} L^e\\,</math>\n** is not applied in practice\n* Expansion: <math>L = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty T^iL^e</math>\n** bi-directional approach: [[Photon mapping]] + Distributed ray tracing, Bi-directional path tracing, [[Metropolis light transport]]\n* Iteration: <math>L_n tl_ e + = L ^{(n-1)}</math>\n** [[Radiosity (computer graphics)|Radiosity]]\nIn Light path notation global lighting the paths of the type L (D | S) corresponds * E.\n\nA full treatment can be found in <ref name=\"WikiMarkup\">{{cite book |title=Advanced Global Illumination, Second Edition |author1=Philip Dutre |author2=Philippe Bekaert |author3=Kavita Bala |isbn=978-1568813073 |date=August 30, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n== Image-based lighting ==\nAnother way to simulate real global illumination is the use of [[High dynamic range imaging|High dynamic range images]] (HDRIs), also known as environment maps, which encircle and illuminate the scene.

The sum of the areas of the purple squares is one third of the area of the large square.]]\n{{Calculus |Series}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''geometric series''' is a [[series (mathematics)|series]] with a constant ratio between successive [[term (mathematics)|terms]].  For example, [[1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7|the series]]\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2} \\,+\\, \\frac{1}{4} \\,+\\, \\frac{1}{8} \\,+\\, \\frac{1}{16} \\,+\\, \\cdots</math>\n\nis geometric, because each successive term can be obtained by multiplying the previous term by 1/2.\n\nGeometric series are among the simplest examples of [[infinite series]] with finite sums, although not all of them have this property.  Historically, geometric series played an important role in the early development of [[calculus]], and they continue to be central in the study of [[convergent series|convergence]] of series.  Geometric series are used throughout mathematics, and they have important applications in [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[biology]], [[economics]], [[computer science]], [[queueing theory]], and [[finance]].\n\n==Common ratio==\n[[File:Geometric Segment.svg|thumb|The convergence of the geometric series with r=1/2 and a=1/2]]\n[[File:Geometrische reihe.svg|thumb|The convergence of the geometric series with r=1/4 and a=1]]\nThe terms of a geometric series form a [[geometric progression]], meaning that the ratio of successive terms in the series is constant. This relationship allows for the representation of a geometric series using only two terms, ''r'' and ''a''. The term ''r'' is the common ratio, and ''a'' is the first term of the series. As an example the geometric series given in the introduction,\n\n:[[1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7|<math>\\frac{1}{2} \\,+\\, \\frac{1}{4} \\,+\\, \\frac{1}{8} \\,+\\, \\frac{1}{16} \\,+\\, \\cdots</math>]]\n\nmay simply be written as\n\n:<math> a + a r + a r^2 + a r^3 +  \\cdots </math> , with <math> a = \\frac{1}{2} </math> and <math> r = \\frac{1}{2} </math>.\n\nThe following table shows several geometric series with different start terms and common ratios:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n!

In the case above, where ''r'' is one half, the series has the sum one.\n:If ''r'' is '''greater than one''' or '''less than minus one''' the terms of the series become larger and larger in magnitude. The sum of the terms also gets larger and larger, and the series has no sum. (The series [[Divergent series|diverges]].)\n:If ''r'' is '''equal to one''', all of the terms of the series are the same. The series diverges.\n:If ''r'' is '''minus one''' the terms take two values alternately (e.g. 2, &minus;2, 2, &minus;2, 2,... ). The sum of the terms [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillates]] between two values (e.g. 2, 0, 2, 0, 2,... ). This is a different type of divergence and again the series has no sum. See for example [[Grandi's series]]:  1 &minus; 1 + 1 &minus; 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\n\n{{anchor|Sum}}\n\n==Sum==\nThe [[summation|sum]] of a geometric series is finite as long as the absolute value of the ratio is less than 1; as the numbers near zero, they become insignificantly small, allowing a sum to be calculated despite the series containing infinitely many terms. The sum can be computed using the [[self-similarity]] of the series.\n\n===Example===\n[[File:GeometricCircles.png|300px|thumb|right|A [[self-similar]] illustration of the sum ''s''.  Removing the largest circle results in a similar figure of 2/3 the original size.]]\nConsider the sum of the following geometric series:\n:<math>s \\;=\\; 1 \\,+\\, \\frac{2}{3} \\,+\\, \\frac{4}{9} \\,+\\, \\frac{8}{27} \\,+\\, \\cdots .</math>\nThis series has common ratio 2/3. If we multiply through by this common ratio, then the initial 1 becomes a 2/3, the 2/3 becomes a 4/9, and so on:\n:<math>\\frac{2}{3}s \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{3} \\,+\\, \\frac{4}{9} \\,+\\, \\frac{8}{27} \\,+\\, \\frac{16}{81} \\,+\\, \\cdots .</math>\nThis new series is the same as the original, except that the first term is missing. Subtracting the new series (2/3)''s'' from the original series ''s'' cancels every term in the original but the first,\n:<math>s \\,-\\, \\frac{2}{3}s \\;=\\; 1,\\;\\;\\;\\mbox{so }s=3.</math>\nA similar technique can be used to evaluate any [[self-similar]] expression.\n\n===Formula===\n\nFor <math>r\\neq 1</math>, the [[Finite geometric series|sum of the first ''n'' terms of a geometric series]] is\n\n:<math>a + ar + a r^2 + a r^3 + \\cdots + a r^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k= a \\left(\\frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''a''}} is the first term of the series, and {{math|''r''}} is the common ratio.  We can derive this formula as follows:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\ns &= a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \\cdots + ar^{n-1}, \\\\\nrs &= ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 + \\cdots + ar^{n},  \\\\\ns - rs &= a-ar^{n},  \\\\\ns(1-r) &= a(1-r^{n}),\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nso, \n:<math>s = a \\left(\\frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}\\right) \\quad \\text{(if } r \\neq 1 \\text{)}.</math>\nAs {{math|''n''}} goes to infinity, the absolute value of {{math|''r''}} must be less than one for the series to converge. The sum then becomes\n\n:<math>a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+ar^4+\\cdots = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty ar^k = \\frac{a}{1-r}, \\text{ for } |r|<1. </math>\n\nWhen {{math|1= ''a'' = 1}}, this can be simplified to\n\n:<math>1 \\,+\\, r \\,+\\, r^2 \\,+\\, r^3 \\,+\\, \\cdots \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{1-r},</math>\n\nthe left-hand side being a geometric series with common ratio {{math|''r''}}.\n\nThe formula also holds for complex {{math|''r''}}, with the corresponding restriction, the modulus of {{math|''r''}} is strictly less than one.\n\n===Proof of convergence===\nWe can prove that the geometric series [[convergent series|converges]] using the sum formula for a [[geometric progression]]:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + \\cdots \\ &= \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\left(1 + r + r^2 + \\cdots + r^n\\right) \\\\\n&= \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nSince (1 + ''r'' + ''r''<sup>2</sup> + ... + ''r''<sup>''n''</sup>)(1&minus;''r'') = 1&minus;''r''<sup>''n''+1</sup> and {{nowrap| ''r''<sup>''n''+1</sup> &rarr; 0}} for |&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;|&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1.\n\nConvergence of geometric series can also be demonstrated by rewriting the series as an equivalent [[telescoping series]].  Consider the function,\n:<math>\ng(K) = \\frac{r^{K}}{1-r}.\n</math>\nNote that\n:<math>\n1 = g(0) - g(1)\\ ,\\ r = g(1) - g(2)\\ ,\\ r^2 = g(2) - g(3)\\ , \\ldots\n</math>\nThus,\n:<math>\nS = 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + \\cdots = (g(0) - g(1)) + (g(1) - g(2)) + (g(2) - g(3)) + \\cdots .\n</math>\nIf\n:<math> |r| <1 </math>\nthen\n:<math>\ng(K)\\longrightarrow 0  \\text{ as } K \\to \\infty.\n</math>\nSo ''S'' converges to\n:<math>\ng(0) = \\frac{1}{1-r}.\n</math>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Repeating decimals===\n{{main|Repeating decimal}}\nA repeating decimal can be thought of as a geometric series whose common ratio is a power of 1/10.  For example:\n\n:<math>0.7777\\ldots \\;=\\; \\frac{7}{10} \\,+\\, \\frac{7}{100} \\,+\\, \\frac{7}{1000} \\,+\\, \\frac{7}{10000} \\,+\\, \\cdots.</math>\n\nThe formula for the sum of a geometric series can be used to convert the decimal to a fraction,\n\n:<math>0.7777\\ldots \\;=\\; \\frac{a}{1-r} \\;=\\; \\frac{7/10}{1-1/10} \\;=\\; \\frac{7/10}{9/10} \\;=\\; \\frac{7}{9}.</math>\n\nThe formula works not only for a single repeating figure, but also for a repeating group of figures. For example:\n\n:<math>0.123412341234\\ldots \\;=\\; \\frac{a}{1-r} \\;=\\; \\frac{1234/10000}{1-1/10000} \\;=\\; \\frac{1234/10000}{9999/10000} \\;=\\; \\frac{1234}{9999}.</math>\n\nNote that every series of repeating consecutive decimals can be conveniently simplified with the following:\n\n:<math>0.09090909\\ldots \\;=\\; \\frac{09}{99} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{11}.</math>\n\n:<math>0.143814381438\\ldots \\;=\\; \\frac{1438}{9999}.</math>\n\n:<math>0.9999\\ldots \\;=\\; \\frac{9}{9} \\;=\\; 1.</math>\n\nThat is, a repeating decimal with repeat length {{math|n}} is equal to the quotient of the repeating part (as an integer) and {{math|10<sup>n</sup> - 1}}.\n\n===Archimedes' quadrature of the parabola===\n[[Image:Parabolic Segment Dissection.svg|thumb|300px|Archimedes' dissection of a parabolic segment into infinitely many triangles]]\n{{main|The Quadrature of the Parabola}}\n[[Archimedes]] used the sum of a geometric series to compute the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line.  His method was to dissect the area into an infinite number of triangles.\n\nArchimedes' Theorem states that the total area under the parabola is 4/3 of the area of the blue triangle.\n\nArchimedes determined that each green triangle has 1/8 the area of the blue triangle, each yellow triangle has 1/8 the area of a green triangle, and so forth.\n\nAssuming that the blue triangle has area 1, the total area is an infinite sum:\n:<math>1 \\,+\\, 2\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) \\,+\\, 4\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 \\,+\\, 8\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^3 \\,+\\, \\cdots.</math>\n\nThe first term represents the area of the blue triangle, the second term the areas of the two green triangles, the third term the areas of the four yellow triangles, and so on.  Simplifying the fractions gives\n:<math>1 \\,+\\, \\frac{1}{4} \\,+\\, \\frac{1}{16} \\,+\\, \\frac{1}{64} \\,+\\, \\cdots.</math>\n\nThis is a geometric series with common ratio {{nowrap|1/4}} and the fractional part is equal to\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty 4^{-n} = 1 + 4^{-1} + 4^{-2} + 4^{-3} + \\cdots = {4\\over 3}. </math>\n\nThe sum is\n:<math>\\frac{1}{1 -r}\\;=\\;\\frac{1}{1 -\\frac{1}{4}}\\;=\\;\\frac{4}{3}.</math>\n\nThis computation uses the [[method of exhaustion]], an early version of [[Integral|integration]]. Using [[calculus]], the same area could be found by a [[definite integral]].\n\n===Fractal geometry===\n[[File:Koch Snowflake Triangles.png|thumb|The interior of the [[Koch snowflake]] is a union of infinitely many triangles.]]\nIn the study of [[fractal]]s, geometric series often arise as the [[perimeter]], [[area]], or [[volume]] of a [[self-similarity|self-similar]] figure.\n\nFor example, the area inside the [[Koch snowflake]] can be described as the union of infinitely many [[equilateral triangle]]s (see figure).  Each side of the green triangle is exactly 1/3 the size of a side of the large blue triangle, and therefore has exactly 1/9 the area.  Similarly, each yellow triangle has 1/9 the area of a green triangle, and so forth.  Taking the blue triangle as a unit of area, the total area of the snowflake is\n\n:<math>1 \\,+\\, 3\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right) \\,+\\, 12\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^2 \\,+\\, 48\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^3 \\,+\\, \\cdots.</math>\n\nThe first term of this series represents the area of the blue triangle, the second term the total area of the three green triangles, the third term the total area of the twelve yellow triangles, and so forth.  Excluding the initial 1, this series is geometric with constant ratio ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4/9.  The first term of the geometric series is ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3(1/9)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/3, so the sum is\n\n:<math>1\\,+\\,\\frac{a}{1-r}\\;=\\;1\\,+\\,\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{1-\\frac{4}{9}}\\;=\\;\\frac{8}{5}.</math>\n\nThus the Koch snowflake has 8/5 of the area of the base triangle.\n\n===Zeno's paradoxes===\n{{main|Zeno's paradoxes}}\nThe convergence of a geometric series reveals that a sum involving an infinite number of summands can indeed be finite, and so allows one to resolve many of [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]'s paradoxes. For example, Zeno's dichotomy paradox maintains that movement is impossible, as one can divide any finite path into an infinite number of steps wherein each step is taken to be half the remaining distance. Zeno's mistake is in the assumption that the sum of an infinite number of finite steps cannot be finite. This is of course not true, as evidenced by the convergence of the geometric series with <math>r = 1/2</math>.\n\n===Euclid===\n\nBook IX, Proposition 35<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookIX/propIX35.html |title=Euclid's Elements, Book IX, Proposition 35 |publisher=Aleph0.clarku.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}</ref> of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] expresses the partial sum of a geometric series in terms of members of the series. It is equivalent to the modern formula.\n\n===Economics===\n{{main|Time value of money}}\nIn [[economics]], geometric series are used to represent the [[present value]] of an [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuity]] (a sum of money to be paid in regular intervals).\n\nFor example, suppose that a payment of $100 will be made to the owner of the annuity once per year (at the end of the year) in [[perpetuity]].  Receiving $100 a year from now is worth less than an immediate $100, because one cannot [[investment|invest]] the money until one receives it.  In particular, the present value of $100 one year in the future is $100&nbsp;/&nbsp;(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;<math>I</math> ), where <math>I</math> is the yearly interest rate.\n\nSimilarly, a payment of $100 two years in the future has a present value of $100&nbsp;/&nbsp;(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;<math>I</math>)<sup>2</sup> (squared because two years' worth of interest is lost by not receiving the money right now).  Therefore, the present value of receiving $100 per year in perpetuity is\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\$100}{(1+I)^n},</math>\n\nwhich is the infinite series:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\$ 100}{(1+I)} \\,+\\, \\frac{\\$ 100}{(1+I)^2} \\,+\\, \\frac{\\$ 100}{(1+I)^3} \\,+\\, \\frac{\\$ 100}{(1+I)^4} \\,+\\, \\cdots.</math>\n\nThis is a geometric series with common ratio 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;<math>I</math> ).  The sum is the first term divided by (one minus the common ratio):\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\$ 100/(1+I)}{1 - 1/(1+I)} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\$ 100}{I}.</math>\n\nFor example, if the yearly interest rate is 10% (<math>I</math>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.10), then the entire annuity has a present value of $100 / 0.10 = $1000.\n\nThis sort of calculation is used to compute the [[annual percentage rate|APR]] of a loan (such as a [[mortgage loan]]).  It can also be used to estimate the present value of expected [[Dividend|stock dividends]], or the [[Terminal value (finance)|terminal value]] of a [[security (finance)|security]].\n\n===Geometric power series===\n\nThe formula for a geometric series\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{1-x}=1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+\\cdots</math>\n\ncan be interpreted as a [[power series]] in the [[Taylor's theorem]] sense, converging where <math>|x|<1</math>. From this, one can extrapolate to obtain other power series. For example,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\tan^{-1}(x)&=\\int\\frac{dx}{1+x^2}\\\\\n&=\\int\\frac{dx}{1-(-x^2)}\\\\\n&=\\int\\left(1 + \\left(-x^2\\right) + \\left(-x^2\\right)^2 + \\left(-x^2\\right)^3+\\cdots\\right)dx\\\\\n&=\\int\\left(1-x^2+x^4-x^6+\\cdots\\right)dx\\\\\n&=x-\\frac{x^3}{3}+\\frac{x^5}{5}-\\frac{x^7}{7}+\\cdots\\\\\n&=\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=0} \\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} x^{2n+1}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy differentiating the geometric series, one obtains the variant<ref>{{cite book |first=Angus E. |last=Taylor |title=Advanced Calculus |publisher=Blaisdell |year=1955 |page=603 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYc_AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA603 }}</ref>\n\n:<math> \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1}n x^{n-1}=\\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\\quad\\text{ for }|x| < 1.</math>\n\nSimilarly obtained are:\n:<math>\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=2} n (n-1) x^{n-2}=\\frac{2}{(1-x)^3}\\quad\\text{ for }|x| < 1,</math> and\n\n:<math>\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=3} n (n-1)(n-2) x^{n-3}=\\frac{6}{(1-x)^4} \\quad\\text{ for }|x| < 1.</math>\n\n==See also==\n*[[0.999...]]\n*[[Asymptote]]\n*[[Divergent geometric series]]\n*[[Generalized hypergeometric function]]\n*[[Geometric progression]]\n*[[Neumann series]]\n*[[Ratio test]]\n*[[Root test]]\n*[[Series (mathematics)]]\n\n===Specific geometric series===\n*[[Grandi's series]]: 1 \u2212 1 + 1 \u2212 1 + \u22ef\n*[[1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \u22ef]]\n*[[1 \u2212 2 + 4 \u2212 8 + \u22ef]]\n*[[1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + \u22ef]]\n*[[1/2 \u2212 1/4 + 1/8 \u2212 1/16 + \u22ef]]\n*[[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + \u22ef]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n*  Abramowitz, M. and Stegun, I.

The second largest island is [[Euboea]], which is separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide [[Euripus Strait]], and is administered as part of the [[Central Greece (region)|Central Greece]] region. After the third and fourth largest Greek Islands, [[Lesbos]] and [[Rhodes]], the rest of the islands are two-thirds of the area of Rhodes, or smaller.\n\nThe Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters:  the [[Argo-Saronic Islands]] in the Saronic gulf near [[Athens]]; the [[Cyclades]], a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea; the [[North Aegean islands]], a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey; the [[Dodecanese]], another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey; the [[Sporades]], a small tight group off the coast of Euboea; and the [[Ionian Islands]], chiefly located to the west of the mainland in the [[Ionian Sea]]. Crete with its surrounding islets and Euboea are traditionally excluded from this grouping.\n\n== Islands of Greece by size ==\nThe following are the largest Greek islands listed by surface area.

theatrical machinery, as well as a wide variety of decorative art objects including lamps, tables, mirrors, and even coaches. As architect and city planner, he designed both secular buildings and churches and chapels, as well as massive works combining both architecture and sculpture, especially elaborate public fountains and funerary monuments and a whole series of temporary structures (in stucco and wood) for funerals and festivals.\n\nBernini possessed the ability to depict dramatic narratives with characters showing intense psychological states, but also to organize large-scale sculptural works that convey a magnificent grandeur.<ref>Wittkower, p. 13.</ref> His skill in manipulating marble ensured that he would be considered a worthy successor of [[Michelangelo]], far outshining other sculptors of his generation, including his rivals, [[Fran\u00e7ois Duquesnoy]] and [[Alessandro Algardi]].

Early in their careers they had all worked at the same time at the [[Palazzo Barberini]], initially under [[Carlo Maderno]] and, following his death, under Bernini. Later on, however, they were in competition for commissions, and fierce rivalries developed, particularly between Bernini and Borromini.<ref name=\"mileti\">{{cite book|last=Mileti |first=Nick J. |title=Beyond Michelangelo: The deadly rivalry between Bernini and Borromini |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |isbn=}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}<ref name=\"morrissey\">{{cite book|last=Morrissey |first=Jake |title=Genius in the Design: Bernini, Borromini and the rivalry that transformed Rome |publisher=Harper Perennial |location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=}} The rivalry between Borromini and Bernini, though very much real, tends to be over-dramatized in popular works like that of Morrissey and in self-published non-scholarly works like that of Mileti. For a more careful, considered summary by a Bernini scholar, see Franco Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome,'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011, pp. 80-83.</ref> Despite the arguably greater architectural inventiveness of Borromini and Cortona, Bernini's artistic pre-eminence, particularly during the reigns of popes [[Urban VIII]] (1623\u201344) and [[Alexander VII]] (1655\u201365), meant he was able to secure the most important commissions in the Rome of his day, the various massive embellishment projects of the newly finished [[St. Peter's Basilica]], completed under Pope Paul V with the addition of Maderno's nave and facade and finally re-consecrated by Pope Urban VIII on 18 November 1626, after 150 years of planning and building. Bernini's design of the [[Piazza San Pietro]] in front of the Basilica is one of his most innovative and successful architectural designs. Within the basilica he is also responsible for the Baldacchino, the decoration of the four piers under the cupola, the Cathedra Petri or [[Chair of St. Peter]] in the apse, the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in the right nave, and the decoration (floor, walls and arches) of the new nave.\n\nDuring his long career, Bernini received numerous important commissions, many of which were associated with the papacy. At an early age, he came to the attention of the [[papal nephew]], [[Cardinal Scipione Borghese]], and in 1621, at the age of only twenty-three, he was knighted by Pope [[Gregory XV]]. Following his accession to the papacy, Urban VIII is reported to have said, \"It is a great fortune for you, O Cavaliere, to see Cardinal Maffeo Barberini made pope, but our fortune is even greater to have Cavalier Bernini alive in our pontificate.\"<ref>Franco Mormando, ed. and trans., Domenico Bernini, ''Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini,'' University Park, Penn State Univ. Press, 2011., p. 111.</ref> Although he did not fare so well during the reign of [[Innocent X]], under Alexander VII, he once again regained pre-eminent artistic domination and continued to be held in high regard by [[Clement IX]].\n\nBernini and other artists fell from favor in later [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] criticism of the [[Baroque]]. It is only from the late nineteenth century that art historical scholarship, in seeking an understanding of artistic output in the cultural context in which it was produced, has come to recognise Bernini's achievements and restore his artistic reputation. The art historian Howard Hibbard concludes that, during the seventeenth century, \"there were no sculptors or architects comparable to Bernini\".<ref>Hibbard, p. 21.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nBernini was born in [[Naples]] in 1598 to  Angelica Galante and [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] sculptor [[Pietro Bernini]], originally from [[Florence]].

He was \u201crecognized as a prodigy when he was only eight years old, [and] he was consistently encouraged by his father, Pietro. His precocity earned him the admiration and favor of powerful patrons who hailed him as \u2018the Michelangelo of his century\u2019\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pos\u00e9q|first=Avigdor W.G.|title=On Physiognomic Communication in Bernini|journal=Artibus Et Historiae|volume=27.54 (2006)}} More correctly and more specifically, it was Pope Paul V who after first attesting to the boy Bernini's talent, famously remarked: 'This child will be the Michelangelo of his age,' as reported by Domenico Bernini (see F. Mormando, ''Domenico Bernini's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini,'' 2011, pp. 98 and 100.</ref> In 1606 his father received a papal commission (to contribute a marble relief in the Cappella Paolina of Santa Maria Maggiore) and so moved from Naples to Rome, taking his entire family with him and continuing in earnest the training of his son Gian Lorenzo. Several extant works, dating from circa 1615-20, are by general scholarly consensus, collaborative efforts by both father and son: they include the ''Faun Teased by Putti'' (c. 1615, Metropolitan Museum, NYC), ''Boy with a Dragon'' (c. 1616-17, Getty Museum, Los Angeles), the Aldobrandini ''Four Seasons'' (c. 1620, private collection), and the recently discovered ''Bust of the Savior'' (1615-16, New York, private collection).<ref>For these works, see the 2017 Galleria Borghese exhibition catalogue, ''Bernini'' (eds. Andrea Bacchi and Anna Coliva [Milan: Officina Libraria, 2017), respectively pp. 38-41, 68-71, 48-53 and 28.</ref> Sometime after the arrival of the Bernini family in Rome, word about the great talent of the boy Gian Lorenzo got around and he soon caught the attention of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew to the reigning pope, Paul V, who spoke of the boy genius to his uncle. Bernini was therefore presented before Pope Paul V, curious to see if the stories about Gian Lorenzo's talent were true. The boy improvised a sketch of Saint Paul for the marveling pope, and this was the beginning of the pope\u2019s attention on this young talent.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Simon Schama's Power of Art|last=Schama|first=Simon|publisher=BBC|year=2006|isbn=|location=London|pages=111\u2013125|via=Print}} Unfortunately Schama's popularizing version of Bernini's life, done for TV, is not always factually accurate, repeating old unsubstantiated legends.</ref> Once he was brought to Rome, he rarely left its walls, except (much against his will) for a five-month stay in Paris in the service of King Louis XIV and brief trips to nearby towns (including Civitavecchia, Tivoli and Castelgandolfo), mostly for work-related reasons. Rome was Bernini\u2019s city: \u201c\u2018You are made for Rome,\u2019 said Pope Urban VIII to him, \u2018and Rome for you\u2019\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Briggs|first=Martin S.|title=The Genius of Bernini|journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs|volume=26.143 (1915)|pages=197\u2013202}}</ref> It was in this world of 17th-century Rome and religious power that Bernini created his greatest works.\n\n===Early works for Cardinal Borghese===\n[[File:Apollo and Daphne (Bernini).jpg|thumb|''[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]'' (1622\u201325)]]\n\nUnder the patronage of the extravagantly wealthy and most powerful Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the young Bernini rapidly rose to prominence as a sculptor. Among his early works for the cardinal were decorative pieces for the garden of the [[Villa Borghese]] such as ''[[The Goat Amalthea with the Infant Jupiter and a Faun]].'' Other allegorical [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] also date to this period, including the so-called ''[[Damned Soul (Bernini)|Damned Soul]]'' and ''[[Blessed Soul (Bernini)|Blessed Soul]]'' of circa 1619, which may have been influenced by a set of prints by [[Pieter de Jode I]] but which were in fact unambiguously cataloged in the inventory of their first documented owner, Fernando de Botinete y Acevedo, as depicting a nymph and a satyr, a commonly paired duo in ancient sculpture (they were not commissioned by nor ever belonged to either Scipione Borghese or, as most scholarship erroneously claims, the Spanish cleric, Pedro Foix Montoya).<ref>Eckhard Leuschner, The Role of Prints in the Artistic Genealogy of Bernini\u2019s Anima beata and Anima damnata, ''Print Quarterly'', 2016: 33:2. For the newly discovered archival documentation about the provenance and original identity of the subjects of the two busts, see David Garc\u00eda Cueto, 'On the original meanings of Gian Lorenzo Bernini\u2019s Anima beata and Anima dannata: Nymph and Satyr?,' ''Sculpture Journal,'' 2015, 24:1:37-53.</ref> By the time he was twenty-two, Bernini was considered talented enough to have been given a commission for a papal portrait, the ''[[Bust of Pope Paul V (Bernini)|Bust of Pope Paul V]]'', now in the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]].\n\nBernini's reputation, however, was definitively established by four masterpieces, executed between 1619 and 1625, all now displayed in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. To the art historian Rudolf Wittkower these four works\u2014''[[Aeneas, Anchises, and Ascanius]]'' (1619), ''[[The Rape of Proserpina (Bernini)|The Rape of Proserpina]]'' (1621\u201322), ''[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]'' (1622\u201325), and ''[[David (Bernini)|David]]'' (1623\u201324)\u2014\"inaugurated a new era in the history of European sculpture\".<ref>Wittkower, p. 14.</ref> It is a view repeated by other scholars.<ref>Hibbard, p. 14. Although Hibbard, as well as other scholars, are more reticent about the overall quality of the earliest of these sculptures, of [[Aeneas, Anchises, and Ascanius]].</ref> Adapting the classical grandeur of Renaissance sculpture and the dynamic energy of the Mannerist period, Bernini forged a new, distinctly Baroque conception for religious and historical sculpture, powerfully imbued with dramatic realism, stirring emotion and dynamic, theatrical compositions. Bernini's early sculpture groups and portraits manifest \"a command of the human form in motion and a technical sophistication rivalled only by the greatest sculptors of classical antiquity.\"<ref>Timothy Clifford and Michael Clarke, Foreword, ''Effigies and Ecstasies: Roman Baroque Sculpture and Design in the Age of Bernini'', Edinburgh: National Gallery of Scotland, 1998, p.7</ref>\n\nUnlike sculptures done by his predecessors, these focus on specific points of narrative tension in the stories they are trying to tell: Aeneas and his family fleeing the burning Troy; the instant that Pluto finally grasps the hunted Persephone; the precise moment that Apollo sees his beloved Daphne begin her transformation into a tree. They are transitory but dramatic powerful moments in each story. Bernini's ''David'' is another stirring example of this. Michelangelo's motionless, idealized ''David'' shows the subject holding a rock in one hand and a sling in the other, contemplating the battle; similarly immobile versions by other Renaissance artists, including Donatello's, show the subject in his triumph after the battle with Goliath. Bernini illustrates David during his active combat with the giant, as he twists his body to catapult toward Goliath. To emphasize these moments, and to ensure that they were appreciated by the viewer, Bernini designed the sculptures with a specific viewpoint in mind. Their original placements within the Villa Borghese were against walls so that the viewers' first view was the dramatic moment of the narrative.<ref>Wittkower, p. 15.</ref><ref>Hibbard, pp. 53-54.</ref>\n\nThe result of such an approach is to invest the sculptures with greater psychological energy. The viewer finds it easier to gauge the state of mind of the characters and therefore understands the larger story at work: Daphne's wide open mouth in fear and astonishment, David biting his lip in determined concentration, or Proserpina desperately struggling to free herself. In addition to portraying psychological realism, they show a greater concern for representing physical details. The tousled hair of Pluto, the pliant flesh of Proserpina, or the forest of leaves beginning to envelop Daphne all demonstrate Bernini's exactitude and delight for representing complex real world textures in marble form.<ref>Wittkower, pp. 14\u201315.</ref><ref>Hibbard, pp. 48\u201361.</ref>\n\n=== Papal artist===\n[[File:San pietro, baldacchino.JPG|thumb|''Baldacchino'' in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]]]\n\nIn 1623, upon the ascent of Cardinal [[Maffeo Barberini]] to the papal throne as Pope Urban VIII, and Bernini's subsequent near monopolistic patronage from the Barberini pope and family, the artist's horizons rapidly and widely broadened. He was not just producing sculpture for private residences, but playing the most significant artistic (and engineering) role on the city stage, as sculptor, architect, and urban planner.<ref>Hibbard, p. 68</ref> His official appointments also testify to this\u2014\"curator of the papal art collection, director of the papal foundry at Castel Sant'Angelo, commissioner of the fountains of [[Piazza Navona]]\".<ref>Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome,'' 2011, p. 72</ref> Such positions gave Bernini the opportunity to demonstrate his versatile skills throughout the city. To great protest from older, most experienced architects, he was appointed Chief Architect of St Peter's in 1629, upon the death of Carlo Maderno. From then on, Bernini's work and artistic vision would be placed at the symbolic heart of Rome.\n\nThe [[St. Peter's Baldacchino|St Peter's Baldacchino]] was the centerpiece of his ambitious plans for the embellishment of the recently completed but still rather unadorned St. Peter's. Designed as a massive spiraling gilded bronze canopy over the tomb of St Peter, Bernini's four-pillared creation reached nearly {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ground and cost around 200,000 Roman scudi (about $8m in currency of the early 21st century).<ref>For the conversion of 17th-century Roman scudi to modern American dollars, see Mormando, \"Bernini: His Life and His Rome\", 2011, pp. xvii-xix, Money, Wages, and Cost of Living in Baroque Rome.</ref> \"Quite simply\", writes one art historian, \"nothing like it had ever been seen before\".<ref>see Franco Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome,'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011, p.84</ref> Soon after the [[St. Peter's Baldacchino|St Peter's Baldacchino]], Bernini undertook the whole-scale embellishment of the four massive piers at crossing of the basilica (i.e., the structures supporting the cupola) including, most notably, four colossal, theatrically dramatic statues, among them, the majestic [[Saint Longinus (Bernini)|St. Longinus]] executed by Bernini himself (the other three are by other contemporary sculptors Fran\u00e7ois Duquesnoy, Francesco Mochi, and Bernini's disciple, Andrea Bolgi). Bernini also began work on the tomb for Urban VIII, completed only after Urban's death in 1644, one in a long, distinguished series of tombs and funerary monuments for which Bernini is famous and a traditional genre upon which his influence left an enduring mark, often copied by subsequent artists. Indeed, Bernini's final and most original tomb monument, the [[Tomb of Pope Alexander VII]], in St. Peter's Basilica, represents, according to Erwin Panofsky, the very pinnacle of European funerary art, whose creative inventiveness subsequent artists could not hope to surpass.<ref>Erwin Panofsky, ''Tomb Sculpture: Four Lectures on Its Changing Aspect From Ancient Egypt to Bernini,'' New York: Abrams, 1992, p.96.</ref>\n\n[[File:Richelieu le Bernin M.R.2165 mp3h9006.jpg|thumb|left|''Bust of Cardinal Armand de Richelieu'' (1640-1641)]]\n\nDespite this engagement with public architecture, Bernini was still able to produce artworks that showed the gradual refinement of his portrait technique. A number of Bernini's sculptures show the continual evolution of his ability to capture the utterly distinctive personal characteristics that he saw in his sitters. This included a number of busts of Urban VIII himself, the family [[Bust of Francesco Barberini (Bernini)|bust of Francesco Barberini]] or most notably, the [[Two Busts of Scipione Borghese]]\u2014the second of which had been rapidly created by Bernini once a flaw had been found in the marble of the first.<ref name=\"Wittkower, p. 88\">Wittkower, p. 88</ref> The transitory nature of the expression on Scipione's face is often noted by art historians, iconic of the Baroque concern for representing movement in static artworks. To Rudolf Wittkower the \"beholder feels that in the twinkle of an eye not only might the expression and attitude change but also the folds of the casually arranged mantle\".<ref name=\"Wittkower, p. 88\"/>\n\nPortraits in marble include that of [[Bust of Costanza Bonarelli|Costanza Bonarelli]] (executed around 1637), unusual in its more personal, intimate nature (in fact, it would appear to be the first fully finished marble portrait of a non-aristocratic woman by a major artist in European history). Bernini had an affair with Costanza, who was the wife of one of his assistants. When Bernini then suspected Costanza of involvement with his brother, he badly beat him and ordered a servant to slash her face with a razor. Pope Urban VIII intervened on his behalf, and he was simply fined.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=456|title=Biographies \u2013 Gian Lorenzo Bernini|accessdate=29 October 2009|work=National Gallery of Canada}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the late 1630s, now known in Europe as one of the most accomplished portraitists in marble, Bernini also began to receive royal commissions from outside Rome, for subjects such as [[Cardinal Richelieu]] of France, [[Francesco I d'Este]] the powerful Duke of Modena, [[Charles I of England]] and [[Henrietta Maria of France|his wife, Queen Henrietta Maria]]. The sculpture of Charles I was produced in Rome from a triple portrait (oil on canvas) executed by [[Van Dyck]], that survives today in the British Royal Collection. The bust of Charles was lost in the [[Whitehall Palace]] fire of 1698 (though its design is known through contemporary copies and drawings) and that of Henrietta Maria was not undertaken due to the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131120043243/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?object=404420&row=2062&detail=about Triple Portrait of Charles I]</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=[[Lionel Cust]]|title=Van Dyck|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ay9zMlAZG9cC&pg=PA94|accessdate=19 April 2012|date=31 March 2007|publisher=Wellhausen Press|isbn=978-1-4067-7452-8|page=94}}</ref>\n\n===Under Innocent X===\n[[File:Ecstasy of Saint Teresa September 2015-2a.jpg|thumb|''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'', 1651]]\n\nUnder Urban VIII, Bernini had been appointed chief architect for the basilica of St. Peter's. Work by Bernini included the aforementioned Baldacchino and the St Longinus. In 1636, eager to finally finish the exterior of St. Peter's, Pope Urban ordered Bernini to design and build the two long-intended bell towers for its facade: the foundations of the two towers had already been designed and constructed (namely, the last bays at either extremity of the facade) by Carlo Maderno (architect of the nave and the facade) decades earlier. Once the first tower was finished in 1641, cracks began to appear in the facade but, curiously enough, work continued on the second tower and the first storey was completed. Despite the presence of the cracks, work only stopped in July 1642 once the papal treasury had been exhausted by the disastrous War of Castro. With the death of Pope Urban and the ascent to power of Barberini-enemy in 1644, Pope Innocent X Pamphilj, Bernini's enemies (especially Borromini) raised a great alarm over the cracks, predicting a disaster for the whole basilica and placing the blame entirely on Bernini. The subsequent investigations, in fact, revealed the cause of the cracks as Maderno's defective foundations and not Bernini's elaborate design, an exoneration later confirmed by the meticulous investigation conducted in 1680 under Pope Innocent XI.<ref>For a thorough summary of this entire, long and complicated episode in Bernini's life that takes into account the latest archival discoveries, see Franco Mormando, ''Domenico Bernini: The Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini,'' University Park: Penn State University Press, 2011, pp. 332-34, nn.17-23 and pp. 342-45, nn. 4-21.</ref>\n\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico - BEIC 6356397.jpg|thumb|''[[Truth Unveiled by Time (Bernini)|Truth Unveiled by Time]]'', [[Galleria Borghese]], Rome, Photo by [[Paolo Monti]]]]\n\nNonetheless, Bernini's opponents in Rome succeeded in seriously damaging the reputation of Urban's artist and in persuading the pope to order (in February 1646) the complete demolition of both towers, to Bernini's great humiliation and indeed financial detriment. After this, one of the rare failures of his career, Bernini retreated into himself: according to his son, Domenico. his subsequent unfinished statue of 1647, ''[[Truth Unveiled by Time (Bernini)|Truth Unveiled by Time]]'', was intended to be his self-consoling commentary on this affair, expressing his faith that eventually Time would reveal the actual Truth behind the story and exonerate him fully, as indeed did occur.\n\nBernini did not entirely lose patronage, not even of the pope. Innocent X maintained Bernini in all of the official roles given to him by Urban. Under Bernini's design and direction, work continued on decorating the massive new but entirely unadorned nave of St. Peter's, with the addition of an elaborate multi-colored marble flooring, marble facing on the walls and pilasters, and scores of stuccoed statues and reliefs. It is not without reason that Pope Alexander VII once quipped, 'if one were to remove from Saint Peter's everything that had been made by the Cavalier Bernini, that temple would be stripped bare.' Indeed, given all of his many and various works within the basilica over several decades, it is to Bernini that is due the lion's share of responsibility for the final and enduring aesthetic appearance and emotional impact of St. Peter's.<ref>Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and HIs Rome,'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011, p.156 (for work on nave) and p. 241 (for Alexander VII quotation).</ref> He was also allowed to continue to work on Urban VIII's tomb, despite Innocent's antipathy for the Barberini.<ref>Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome,'' 2011, p. 150.</ref> A few months after completing Urban's tomb, Bernini won, in controversial circumstances, the Pamphilj commission for the prestigious [[Four Rivers Fountain]] on Piazza Navona, marking the end of his disgrace and the beginning a yet another glorious chapter in his life.\n[[File:Gian lorenzo bernini, Cenotafio di Suor Maria Raggi (1647-53).JPG|thumb|left|''[[Memorial to Maria Raggi]]'', 1651.]]\nIf there had been doubts over Bernini's position as Rome's preeminent artist, the success of the Four Rivers Fountain removed them. Bernini continued to receive commissions from Pope Innocent X and other senior members of Rome's clergy and aristocracy, as well as from exalted patrons outside of Rome, such as [[Bust of Francesco I d'Este|Francesco d'Este]]. In such an environment, Bernini's artistic style flourished. New types of funerary monument were designed, such as the seemingly floating medallion, hovering in the air as it were, for the deceased nun [[Memorial to Maria Raggi|Maria Raggi]], while chapels he designed, such as the Raimondi Chapel in the church of [[San Pietro in Montorio]], illustrated how Bernini could use hidden lighting to help suggest divine intervention within the narratives he was depicting.\n\nThe Cornaro Chapel showcased Bernini's ability to integrate sculpture, architecture, fresco, stucco, and lighting into \"a marvelous whole\" (''bel composto'', to use early biographer Filippo Baldinucci's term to describe his approach to architecture) and thus create what scholar Irving Lavin has called the \"unified work of art\". The central focus of the Cornaro Chapel is the ecstasy of the Spanish nun and saint-mystic, Teresa of Avila.<ref>Lavin, Bernini and the Unity of the Visual Arts, passim</ref> Bernini presents the spectator with a theatrically vivid portrait, in gleaming white marble, of the swooning Teresa and the quietly smiling angel, who delicately grips the arrow piercing the saint's heart. On either side of the chapel the artist places (in what can only strike the viewer as theater boxes), portraits in relief of various members of the Cornaro family \u2014 the Venetian family memorialized in the chapel, including Cardinal Federico Cornaro who commissioned the chapel from Bernini \u2014 who are in animated conversation among themselves, presumably about the event taking place before them. The result is a complex but subtly orchestrated architectural environment providing the spiritual context (a heavenly setting with a hidden source of light) that suggests to viewers the ultimate nature of this miraculous event.<ref>Lavin, ibid.</ref>\n\nIt was an artistic tour de force that incorporates all of the multiple forms of visual art and technique that Bernini had at his disposal, including hidden lighting, thin gilded beams, recessive architectural space, secret lens, and over twenty diverse types of colored marble: these all combine to create the final artwork\u2014\"a perfected, highly dramatic and deeply satisfying seamless ensemble\".<ref>Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome,'' p. 159.</ref>\n\n=== Embellishment of Rome under Alexander VII===\nUpon his accession to the Chair of St Peter, Pope Alexander VII Chigi (1655\u201367) began to implement his extremely ambitious plan to transform Rome into a magnificent world capital by means of systematic, bold (and costly) urban planning. In so doing, he brought to fruition the long, slow recreation of the urban glory of Rome\u2014the \"renovatio Romae\"\u2014that had begun in the fifteenth century under the Renaissance popes.  Alexander immediately commissioned large-scale architectural changes in the city, for example connecting new and existing buildings by opening up streets and piazzas. Bernini\u2019s career showed a greater focus on designing buildings (and their immediate surroundings) during this pontificate, as there were far greater opportunities.\n\n[[File:Bernini self-portrait c1665 - HMG - Gould 1982 plate1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bernini self-portrait, c. 1665]]\n\nBernini\u2019s  creations during this period include the [[St. Peter's Square|piazza leading to St Peter's]]. In a previously broad, unstructured space, he created two massive semi-circular colonnades, each row of which was formed of four white columns. This resulted in an oval shape that formed an inclusive arena within which any gathering of citizens, pilgrims and visitors could witness the appearance of the pope\u2014either as he appeared on the loggia on the facade of St Peter's or on balconies on the neighbouring Vatican palaces. Often likened to two arms reaching out from the church to embrace the waiting crowd, Bernini's creation extended the symbolic greatness of the Vatican area, creating an \"exhilarating expanse\" that was, architecturally, an \"unequivocal success\".<ref>Hibbard, p. 156</ref><ref>Mormando, ''Bernini: His LIfe and His Rome,'' 2011, p. 204</ref><ref>The long, broad, straight avenue (Via della Conciliazione) to the river Tiber was an early 20th century addition, when [[Benito Mussolini]] ordered the clearing of housing that led up to Bernini's piazza in order to afford a more commodious access to the Vatican.</ref>\n\nElsewhere within the Vatican, Bernini created systematic rearrangements and majestic embellishment of either empty or aesthetically undistinguished space that exist as he designed them to the present day and have become indelible icons of the splendor of the papal precincts. Within the hitherto unadorned apse of the basilica, the [[Cathedra Petri]], the symbolic throne of St Peter, was rearranged as a monumental gilded bronze extravagance that matched the [[Baldacchino]] created earlier in the century. Bernini's complete reconstruction of the [[Scala Regia (Vatican)|Scala Regia]], the stately papal stairway between St. Peters's and the Vatican Palace, was slightly less ostentatious in appearance but still taxed Bernini's creative powers (employing, for example, clever tricks of optical illusion) to create a seemingly uniform, totally functional, but nonetheless regally impressive stairway to connect two irregular buildings within an even more irregular space.<ref>Hibbard, pp. 163\u20137</ref>\n\nNot all works during this era were on such a large scale. Indeed, the commission Bernini received to build the church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] for the Jesuits was relatively modest in physical size (though great in its interior chromatic splendor), which Bernini executed completely free of charge. Sant'Andrea shared with the St. Peter's piazza\u2014unlike the complex geometries of his rival [[Francesco Borromini]]\u2014a focus on basic geometric shapes, circles and ovals to create spiritually intense buildings.<ref>Hibbard, pp. 144\u20138</ref> Equally, Bernini moderated the presence of colour and decoration within these buildings, focussing visitors' attention on these simple forms that underpinned the building. Sculptural decoration was never eliminated, but its use was more minimal. He also designed the church of Santa Maria dell'Assunzione in the town of [[Ariccia]] with its circular outline, rounded dome and three-arched portico.<ref>Hibbard, pp. 149\u201350</ref>\n\n===Visit to France===\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, salon de Diane, buste de Louis XIV, Bernin (1665) 03 black bg.jpg|thumb|''Bust of Louis XIV'', 1665]]\n\nAt the end of April 1665, and still considered the most important artist in Rome, if indeed not in all of Europe, Bernini was forced by political pressure (from both the French court and Pope Alexander VII) to travel to Paris to work for King Louis XIV, who required an architect to complete work on the royal palace of the Louvre. Bernini would remain in Paris until mid-October. Louis XIV assigned a member of his court to serve as Bernini's translator, tourist guide, and overall companion, [[Paul Fr\u00e9art de Chantelou]], who kept a ''Journal'' of Bernini's visit that records much of Bernini's behaviour and utterances in Paris.<ref>See Gould, Cecil. ''Bernini in France, an episode in Seventeenth Century History'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1981</ref>\n\nBernini's popularity was such that on his walks in Paris the streets were lined with admiring crowds. But things soon turned sour.<ref>Gould, C., 1982. ''Bernini in France: an episode in 17th-century history.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Pr. For more recent treatments of the same episode in Bernini's life, incorporating the most recent [[documentary research]] since Gould's book of 1982, see Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome,'' 2011, chap. 5, A Roman Artist in King Louis's Court; see also Mormando's many documentary footnotes to Domenico Bernini's account of his father's dealings with the French: Domenico Bernini, ''Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini,\" notes to chapters 16\u201320.''</ref> Bernini presented finished designs for the east front (i.e., the all-important principal facade of the entire palace) of the [[Louvre]], which were ultimately rejected, albeit formally not until 1667, well after his departure from Paris (indeed, the already constructed foundations for Bernini's Louvre addition were inaugurated in October 1665 in an elaborate ceremony, with both Bernini and King Louis in attendance). It is often stated in the scholarship on Bernini that his Louvre designs were turned down because Louis and his financial advisor [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] considered them too Italianate or too Baroque in style.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Bernini|last = Hibbard|first = Howard|publisher = Penguin|year = 1990|isbn = |location = |page=181}}</ref> In fact, as Franco Mormando points out, \"aesthetics are ''never'' mentioned in any of [the] . . . surviving memos\" by Colbert or any of the artistic advisors at the French court. The explicit reasons for the rejections were utilitarian, namely, on the level of physical security and comfort (e.g., location of the latrines).<ref>Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome,'' pp. 255-56, emphasis added. Another issue of concern was the fact that Bernini's plan would have called for the demolition of older portions of the Louvre contrary to royal wishes.</ref>\n\nOther projects suffered a similar fate.<ref><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Fagiolo, M., 2008. Bernini a Parigi: le Colonne d'Ercole, l'Anfiteatro per il Louvre e i progetti per la Cappella Bourbon.</span><br>\n</ref> With the exception of Chantelou, Bernini failed to forge significant friendships at the French court. His frequent negative comments on various aspects of French culture, especially its art and architecture, did not go down well, particularly in juxtaposition to his praise for the art and architecture of Italy (especially Rome); he said that a painting by [[Guido Reni]] was worth more than all of Paris.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Bernini|last = Hibbard|first = Howard|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |page=171}}</ref> The sole work remaining from his time in Paris is the ''[[Bust of Louis XIV (Bernini)|Bust of Louis XIV]]'' although he also contributed a great deal to the execution of the Christ Child Playing with a Nail marble relief (now in the Louvre) by his son Paolo as a gift to the Queen of France. Back in Rome, Bernini created a monumental [[Equestrian Statue of King Louis XIV (Bernini)|equestrian statue of Louis XIV]]; when it finally reached Paris (in 1685, five years after the artist's death), the French king found it extremely repugnant and wanted it destroyed; it was instead re-carved into a representation of the ancient Roman hero [[Marcus Curtius]].<ref>The most thorough study of Bernini's ''King Louis XIV Equestrian'' status, including its ultimate fate in France, remains Rudolf Wittkower, 'The Vicissitudes of a Dynastic Monument: Bernini's Equestrian Statue of Louis XIV.' In ''De artibus Opuscula XL: Essays in Honors of Erwin Panofsky,'' ed. Milard Meiss (New York: New York University Press, 1961), pp. 497-531. For much additional, new data about the work that has surfaced since Wittkower's 1961 work, see the many notes pertinent to the statue in Franco Mormando, ''Domenico Bernini's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini'' (University Park, PA: Penn State University Press, 2011), pp. 396-402.</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Bernini-tomb.jpg|alt=Tomb of Gian Lorenzo Bernini in Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|thumb|Tomb of Gian Lorenzo Bernini in [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]]]]\n[[File:Berninigrave.jpg|thumb|The grave of Bernini in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]]\n\nBernini remained physically and mentally vigorous and active in his profession until just two weeks before his death that came as a result of a stroke. In his last two years, he carved (supposedly for Queen Christina) the bust of the Savior and supervised the restoration of the Palazzo della Cancelleria as per papal commission. He died in Rome on 28 November 1680 and was buried, with little public fanfare, in the simple, unadorned Bernini family vault, along with his parents, in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]]. Though an elaborate funerary monument had once been planned (documented by a single extant sketch of circa 1670), it was never built and Bernini remained with no permanent public acknowledgement of his life and career in Rome until 1898 when a simple plaque and small bust was affixed to the face of his home on the Via della Mercede, proclaiming \"Here lived and died Gianlorenzo Bernini, a sovereign of art, before whom reverently bowed popes, princes, and a multitude of peoples.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nIn the 1630s he engaged in an affair with a married woman named Costanza (wife of his workshop assistant, Matteo Bonucelli, also called Bonarelli) and [[Bust of Costanza Bonarelli|sculpted a bust of her]] (now in the Bargello, Florence) during the height of their romance. She later had an affair with his younger brother, [[Luigi Bernini|Luigi]], who was Bernini's right-hand man in his studio. When Gian Lorenzo found out about Costanza and his brother, in a fit of mad fury, he chased Luigi through the streets of Rome and into the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, threatening his life. To punish his unfaithful mistress, Bernini had a servant go to the house of Costanza, where the servant slashed her face several times with a razor. The servant was later jailed, and Costanza was jailed for adultery; Bernini himself was exonerated by the pope, even though he had committed a crime in ordering the face-slashing.<ref>{{cite book|first=Franco |last=Mormando|title=Bernini: His Life and His Rome|publisher= University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=2011|pages=99\u2013106}}</ref> Soon after, in May 1639, at age forty-one, Bernini wed a twenty-two-year-old Roman woman, Caterina Tezio, in an arranged marriage, under orders from Pope Urban. She bore him eleven children, including youngest son [[Domenico Bernini]], who would later be his first biographer.<ref>For Bernini's marriage to Caterina, and a list of Bernini's children, see Franco Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome,'' University of Chicago Press, 2011, pp. 109\u201316.</ref> After his never-repeated fit of passion and bloody rage and his subsequent marriage, Bernini turned more sincerely to the practice of his faith, according to his early official biographers, whereas brother Luigi was to once again, in 1670, bring great grief and scandal to his family by his sodomitic rape of a young Bernini workshop assistant at the construction site of the 'Constantine' memorial in St. Peter's Basilica.<ref>As Bernini scholar, Franco Mormando, underscores (''Domenico Bernini: LIfe of Gian Lorenzo Bernini'' Intro., pp. 60-61): \"Any discussion of Bernini's religion, that is, his personal faith and the practice of his devotional life, must open with a word of caution: we have absolutely no reliable, nonpartisan (that is, not coming from Bernini, his family, or apologetic biographers) documentation on the topic until 1665, when Chantelou began writing his diary\" (at which time Bernini was 67 years old). For Luigi's 1670 crime, see Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome,'' 307-312.</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nBernini's architectural works include sacred and secular buildings and sometimes their urban settings and interiors.<ref>The most recent and comprehensive study of Bernini's architecture in English is Tod A. Marder, ''Bernini and the Art of Architecture,'' Abbeville Press, New York and London, 1998.</ref> He made adjustments to existing buildings and designed new constructions. Amongst his most well known works are the [[Piazza San Pietro]] (1656\u201367), the [[piazza]] and colonnades in front of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] and the interior decoration of the Basilica. Amongst his secular works are a number of Roman palaces: following the death of Carlo Maderno, he took over the supervision of the building works at the [[Palazzo Barberini]] from 1630 on which he worked with [[Borromini]]; the [[Palazzo Ludovisi]] (now Palazzo Montecitorio, started 1650); and the Palazzo Chigi (now Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi, started 1664).\n\n[[File:Baldachin petersdom.jpg|thumb|left|''St. Peter's baldachin'', 1624\u20131633]]\n\nHis first architectural projects were the fa\u00e7ade and refurbishment of the church of [[Santa Bibiana]] (1624\u201326) and the [[St. Peter's baldachin]] (1624\u201333), the bronze columned canopy over the high altar of [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. In 1629, and before ''[[St. Peter's Baldachin]]'' was complete, [[Urban VIII]] put him in charge of all the ongoing architectural works at St Peter's. However, Bernini fell out of favor during the papacy of Innocent X [[Pamphili]]: one reason was the pope's animosity towards the Barberini and hence towards their clients including Bernini. Another reason was the failure of the belltowers designed and built by Bernini for St. Peter's Basilica, commencing during the reign of Urban VIII. The completed north tower and the only partially completed south tower were ordered demolished by Innocent in 1646 because their excessive weight had caused cracks in the basilica's facade and threatened to do more calamitous damage. Professional opinion at the time was in fact divided over the true gravity of the situation (with Bernini's rival Borromini spreading an extreme, anti-Bernini catastrophic view of the problem) and over the question of responsibility for the damage: Who was to blame? Bernini? Pope Urban VIII who forced Bernini to design over-elaborate towers? Deceased Architect of St. Peter's, Carlo Maderno who built the weak foundations for the towers? Official papal investigations in 1680 in fact completely exonerated Bernini, while inculpating Maderno.<ref>See McPhee, Sarah. ''Bernini and the Bell Towers: Architecture and Politics at the Vatican'', Yale University Press, 2002</ref> Never wholly without patronage during the Pamphili years, after Innocent's death in 1655 Bernini regained a major role in the decoration of St. Peter's with the [[Pope Alexander VII]] [[House of Chigi|Chigi]], leading to his design of the piazza and [[colonnade]] in front of St. Peter's. Further significant works by Bernini at the Vatican include the ''[[Scala Regia (Vatican)|Scala Regia]]'' (1663\u201366), the monumental grand stairway entrance to the Vatican Palace, and the ''[[Chair of Saint Peter|Cathedra Petri]]'', the Chair of Saint Peter, in the apse of St. Peter's, in addition to the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in the nave.\n\n[[File:Sicht vom petersdom roma.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|View of the piazza and colonnade in front of St. Peter's]]\n\nBernini did not build many churches from scratch; rather, his efforts were concentrated on pre-existing structures, such as the restored church of Santa Bibbiana and in particular St. Peter's. He fulfilled three commissions for new churches in Rome and nearby small towns. Best known is the small but richly ornamented oval church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]], done (beginning in 1658) for the Jesuit novitiate, representing one of the rare works of his hand with which Bernini's son, Domenico, reports that his father was truly and very pleased.<ref>See Domenico Bernini, ''The Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini,'' trans. and ed. Franco Mormando, University Park: Penn State University Press, 2011, pp. 178-179. Magnuson Torgil, ''Rome in the Age of Bernini'', Volume II, Almqvist & Wiksell, Stockholm, 1986: 202</ref> Bernini also designed churches in [[Castelgandolfo]] ([[San Tommaso da Villanova]], 1658\u201361) and [[Ariccia]] ([[Santa Maria Assunta (Ariccia)|Santa Maria Assunta]], 1662\u201364).\n\nWhen Bernini was invited to Paris in 1665 to prepare works for [[Louis XIV]], he presented designs for the east facade of the Louvre Palace, but his projects were ultimately turned down in favour of the more sober and classic proposals of the French doctor and amateur architect [[Claude Perrault]],<ref>Most probably made in collaboration with [[Lebrun]] and [[Le Vau]], Blunt, Anthony. ''Architecture in France 1500\u20131700'', Pelican History of Art, 1953, p. 232.</ref> signaling the waning influence of Italian artistic hegemony in France. Bernini's projects were essentially rooted in the Italian Baroque urbanist tradition of relating public buildings to their settings, often leading to innovative architectural expression in urban spaces like ''piazze'' or squares. However, by this time, the French absolutist monarchy now preferred the classicising monumental severity of Perrault's facade, no doubt with the added political bonus that it had been designed by a Frenchman. The final version did, however, include Bernini's feature of a flat roof behind a Palladian balustrade.\n\n==Personal residences==\nDuring his lifetime Bernini lived in various residences throughout the city: principal among them, a palazzo right across from Santa Maria Maggiore and still extant at Via Liberiana 24, while his father was still alive; after his father's death in 1629, Bernini moved the clan to the long-ago-demolished Santa Marta neighborhood behind the apse of St. Peter's Basilica, which afforded him more convenient access to the Vatican Foundry and to his working studio within the basilica itself (now the seat of the Archives of the Fabbrica di San Pietro). In 1639, Bernini bought property on the corner of the via della Mercede and the via del [[Collegio di Propaganda Fide]] in Rome. This gave him the distinction of being the only one of two artists (the other is Pietro da Cortona) to be proprietor of his own large palatial (though not sumptuous) residence. Bernini refurbished and expanded the existing palazzo on the Via della Mercede site, at what are now Nos. 11 and 12. (The building is sometimes referred to as \"Palazzo Bernini,\" but that title more properly pertains to the Bernini family's later and larger home on Via del Corso, to which they moved in the eighteenth century.) Bernini lived at No. 11, but this was extensively remodeled in the 19th century. It is imagined that it must have been galling for Bernini to witness through the windows of his dwelling, the construction of the tower and dome of [[Sant'Andrea delle Fratte]] by his rival, Borromini, and also the demolition of the chapel that he, Bernini, had designed at the Collegio di Propaganda Fide to see it replaced by Borromini's chapel.<ref>Blunt, Anthony. ''Guide to Baroque Rome'', Granada, 1982, p. 166</ref> The construction of Sant'Andrea, however, was completed by Bernini's close disciple, Mattia de' Rossi, and it contains (to this day) the marble originals of two of Bernini's own angels executed by the master for the Ponte Sant'Angelo.\n\n==Fountains in Rome==\n[[File:Lazio Roma Navona2 tango7174.jpg|thumb|''[[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]]'']]\n\nTrue to the decorative dynamism of Baroque, among Bernini's most gifted creations were his Roman fountains, which were both public works and papal monuments. His fountains include the ''[[Triton Fountain|Fountain of the Triton]]'', or ''Fontana del Tritone'', and the Barberini Fountain of the Bees, the ''[[Fontana delle Api]]''.<ref>This was dismantled in the nineteenth century and reassembled (incorrectly) in the twentieth in the Via Veneto. A second ''Fontana delle Api'' in the Vatican has sometimes been attributed to Bernini of which Blunt has written, \"Borromini is documented as having carved the fountain in 1626, but it is not certain whether he made the design for it, and it has also been attributed\u2014not very plausibly\u2014to Bernini.\" Blunt, Anthony. ''Borromini'', Belknap Harvard, 1979, 17</ref> The Fountain of the Four Rivers, or ''[[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]]'', in the [[Piazza Navona]] is a masterpiece of spectacle and political allegory. An oft-repeated, but false, anecdote tells that one of the Bernini's river gods defers his gaze in disapproval of the facade of [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]] (designed by the talented, but less politically successful, rival [[Francesco Borromini]]), impossible because the fountain was built several years before the fa\u00e7ade of the church was completed. Bernini was also the artist of the statue of the Moor in ''[[La Fontana del Moro]]'' in Piazza Navona (1653).\n\n==Other works==\nAnother major category of Bernini's activity was that of the tomb monument, a genre on which his distinctive new style exercised a decisive and long-enduring influence; included in this category are his tombs for Popes Urban VIII and Alexander VII (both in St. Peter's Basilica), Cardinal Domenico Pimental (Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome, design only), and Matilda of Canossa (St. Peter's Basilica). Related to the tomb monument is the funerary memorial, of which Bernini executed several (including that, most notably, of Maria Raggi [Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome] also of greatly innovative style and long enduring influence.<ref>For his tomb monuments and funerary memorials, see the relative pages in Mormando, ''Domenico Bernini's 'Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini,'' University Park, 2011; see also Mormando's 'A Bernini workshop drawing for a tomb monument,' ''The Burlington Magazine'', n. 1376, vol. 159, November 2017: 886-92.</ref> Among his smaller commissions, although not mentioned by either of his earliest biographers, Baldinucci or Domenico Bernini, the [[Elephant and Obelisk]] is a sculpture located near the Pantheon, in the Piazza della Minerva, in front of the Dominican church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]]. Pope [[Alexander VII]] decided that he wanted a small ancient Egyptian [[obelisk]] (that was discovered beneath the piazza) to be erected on the same site, and in 1665 he commissioned Bernini to create a sculpture to support the obelisk. The sculpture of an elephant bearing the obelisk on its back was executed by one of Bernini's students, [[Ercole Ferrata]], upon a design by his master, and finished in 1667. An inscription on the base relates the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Roman goddess Minerva to the Virgin Mary, who supposedly supplanted those pagan goddesses and to whom the church is dedicated.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heckscher|first=W.|title=Bernini's Elephant and Obelisk|journal=Art Bulletin|volume=XXIX|year= 1947|page=155}}</ref> A popular anecdote concerns the elephant's smile. To find out why it is smiling, legend has it, the viewer must examine the rear end of the animal and notice that its muscles are tensed and its tail is shifted to the left as if it were defecating. The animal's rear is pointed directly at one of the headquarters of the Dominican Order, housing the offices of its Inquisitors as well as the office of Father Giuseppe Paglia, a [[Dominican friar]] who was one of the main antagonists of Bernini, as a final salute and last word.<ref>This anecdote regarding the Elephant and Obelisk monument (more formally, it is a monument to Divine Wisdom and a tribute to Pope Alexander VII) is one of the many undocumented popular legends circulating about Bernini. The elephant, in fact, is not smiling, and even though he may have had professional reasons to resent Paglia, the conservative, pious and utterly orthodox Bernini personally had no grudges against the Dominican Order or the Inquisition. Moreover, Giuseppe Paglia was director of the overall project to reconstruct the piazza in front of Santa Maria Minerva, appointed by Pope Alexander VII himself and, as such, had supervisory authority over Bernini and the design of his Elephant and Obelisk monument. The final design of that monument, in fact, owes much to Paglia's direct intervention. Hence, it is unlikely that Paglia (or Pope Alexander) would have allowed this supposed insult to him or his Dominican order. Finally, if Bernini did intend to deliver this visual insult, he failed totally, for there is no contemporary documentation indicating that visitors to the piazza during the artist's lifetime ever noticed the supposed insult: see Franco Mormando, ed. and trans., ''Domenico Bernini's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini'' (University Park: Penn State University Press, 2011), p. 369, n. 33. Instead, the origins of this anecdote can be traced to the very end of the 17th century, when the satirist and Cardinal Lodovico Sergardi circulated a two-line epigram in which the elephant tells the Dominicans that the position of his rear end is meant to announce \"where I hold you in my esteem\" (see Ingrid Rowland, 'The Friendship of Alexander VII and Athanasius Kircher, 1637-1667' in ''Early Modern Rome: Proceedings of a Conference Held on May 13\u201315, 2010 in Rome,'' ed. Portia Prebys [Ferrara: Edisai, 2011], pp. 669-78, here p. 670; see also p. 671 where Rowland absolves Bernini of any satiric intent: 'The Dominicans, who followed the evolution of Bernini's design for this monument with meticulous care from beginning to end, must have realized that the only reasonable placement for this remarkable creation was the placement that we see today.')</ref>\n\n[[File:Gianlorenzo Bernini by Giovanni Battista Gaulli (National Galleries of Scotland).jpg|thumb|left|Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1665, painted by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]]]]\n\nAmong his minor commissions for non-Roman patrons or venues, in 1677 Bernini worked along with [[Ercole Ferrata]] to create a fountain for the Lisbon palace of the Portuguese nobleman, the Count of Ericeira: copying his earlier fountains, Bernini supplied the design of the fountain sculpted by Ferrata, featuring Neptune with four tritons around a basin. The fountain has survived and since 1945 has been outside the precincts of the gardens of the Palacio Nacional de Queluz, several miles outside of Lisbon.<ref>Angela Delaforce et al., 'A Fountain by Gianlorenzo Bernini and Ercole Ferrata in Portugal,' ''Burlington,'' vol. 140, issue 1149, pp. 804-811.</ref>\n\nIn the 1620s, encouraged by Pope Urban VIII who wanted him to fresco the Benediction Loggia of St. Peter's (never executed), Bernini began in earnest to develop and perfect his technique as a painter. He probably had learned the basics from his father who was a painter as well, in addition to some training in the studio of the Florentine painter, Cigoli. According to early biographers, Baldinucci and Domenico Bernini, Bernini completed at least 150 canvases, mostly in the decades of the 1620s and 30s, but currently there are no more than 35-40 surviving paintings that can be confidently attributed to his hand (they are mostly close-up faces\u2014including several wonderfully wrought self-portraits\u2014set against a blank background, employing a loose, painterly brushstroke (similar to that of his Spanish contemporary Velasquez) and a very limited palette of mostly somber colors with deep chiaroscuro. The only one that is securely dated is that of the Apostles Andrew and Thomas in London's National Gallery.<ref>For a concise summary statement about Bernini's training and production as a painter, see Franco Mormando, ed. and trans., ''Domenico Bernini: The Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini'' (University Park: Penn State U Press, 2011), pp. 294-296, nn.4-12.</ref> As for his drawings, about 300 still exist; but this is a minuscule percentage of the drawings he would have created in his lifetime; these include rapid sketches relating to major sculptural or architectural commissions, presentation drawings given as gifts to his patrons and aristocratic friends, and exquisite, fully finished portraits, such as those of Agostino Mascardi (Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris) and Scipione Borghese and Sisinio Poli (both in New York's Morgan Library).<ref>The most complete edition of Bernini drawings remains Heinrich Brauer and Rudolf Wittkower, ''Die Ziechnungen des Gianlorenzo Bernini,'' Berlin: Verlag Heinrich Keller, 1931, reprinted New York: Collectors Edition, 1970.

But his most trusted right-hand man in sculpture was Giulio Cartari, while in architecture it was Mattia de' Rossi, both of whom traveled to Paris with Bernini to assist him in his work there for King Louis XIV. Other architect disciples include Giovanni Battista Contini and Carlo Fontana while Swedish architect, [[Nicodemus Tessin the Younger]], who visited Rome twice after Bernini's death, was also much influenced by him. \n\nAmong his rivals in architecture were [[Francesco Borromini]] and [[Pietro da Cortona]]; in sculpture, [[Alessandro Algardi]] and [[Francois Duquesnoy]], but they both died decades earlier than Bernini (respectively in 1654 and 1643), leaving Bernini effectively with no sculptor of his same exalted status in Rome. [[Francesco Mochi]] can also be included among Bernini's significant rivals, though he was not as accomplished in his art as Bernini, Algardi or Duquesnoy. \n\nThere was also a succession of painters (the so-called 'pittori berniniani')  who, working under the master's close guidance and at times according to his designs, produced canvases and frescos that were integral components of Bernini's larger multi-media works such as churches and chapels: Carlo Pellegrini, Guido Ubaldo Abbatini, Frenchman Guillaume Courtois (Guglielmo Cortese, known as 'Il Borgognone'), Ludovico Gimignani, and Giovanni Battista Gaulli (who, thanks to Bernini, was granted the prized commission to fresco the vault of the Jesuit mother church of the Ges\u00f9 by Bernini's friend, Jesuit Superior General, Gian Paolo Oliva). As far as Caravaggio is concerned, in all the voluminous Bernini sources, his name appears only once, in the Chantelou Diary which records Bernini's disparaging remark about him (specifically his ''Fortune Teller'' that had just arrived from Italy as a Pamphilj gift to King Louis XIV). However, how much Bernini really scorned Caravaggio's art is a matter of debate whereas arguments have been made in favor of a strong influence of Caravaggio on Bernini. Bernini would of course have heard much about Caravaggio and seen many of his works not only because in Rome at the time such contact was impossible to avoid, but also because during his own lifetime Caravaggio had come to the favorable attention of Bernini's own early patrons, both the Borghese and the Barberini.<ref> All of the men mentioned in this section as disciples, collaborators, or rivals are discussed in the notes to Franco Mormando, ''Domenico Bernini's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini'' (University Park: Penn State Univ. Press, 2011), passim, but especially pp. 372-74; for Bernini and Caravaggio, see 285n.39, as well as Tomaso Montanari, ''La libert\u00e0 di Bernini'' (Turin: Einaudi, 2016), pp. 154-84, 'L'eredit\u00e0 di Caravaggio,' who makes an even stronger case for the influence of Caravaggio on Bernini, one that had long been ignored or denied in Bernini scholarship. For Gaulli, Bernini, Gian Paolo Oliva and the decoration of the Jesuit mother church, see the essays by Franco Mormando, Christopher M.S. Johns, and Betsy Rosasco in ''The Holy Name. The Art of the Ges\u00f9: Bernini and His Age,'' ed. Linda Wolk-Simon (Philadelphia: St. Joseph's University Press, 2018.).</ref>\n\n==Biographies==\nThe most important primary source for the life of Bernini is the biography written by his youngest son, Domenico, entitled ''Vita del Cavalier Gio. Lorenzo Bernino,'' published in 1713 though first compiled in the last years of his father's life (c. 1675\u201380).<ref>For a list and discussion of important sources for Bernini's life, see Franco Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011), pp. 7\u201311.</ref> Filippo Baldinucci's ''Life of Bernini,'' was published in 1682, and a meticulous private journal, the ''Diary of the Cavaliere Bernini's Visit to France,'' was kept by the Frenchman [[Paul Fr\u00e9art de Chantelou]] during the artist's four-month stay from June through October 1665 at the court of King Louis XIV. Also, there is a short biographical narrative, ''The Vita Brevis of Gian Lorenzo Bernini'', written by his eldest son, Monsignor Pietro Filippo Bernini, in the mid-1670s.<ref>For an unabridged translation and analysis of ''The Vita Brevis,'' see ''Domenico Bernini's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini'' in Mormando, ed., 201 Appendix 1, pp. 237\u201341.</ref>\n\nUntil the late 20th century, it was generally believed that two years after Bernini's death, Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], then living in Rome, commissioned [[Filippo Baldinucci]] to write his biography, which was published in Florence in 1682.<ref>Baldinucci, Filippo, ''Life of Bernini''. Translated from the Italian by Enggass, C. University Park, Penn State University Press, 2006. Unfortunately, the Enggass edition of Baldinucci contains many translation errors; readers should always consult the text of the original 1682 edition.</ref> However, recent research now strongly suggests that it was in fact Bernini's sons (and specifically the eldest son, Mons. Pietro Filippo) who commissioned the biography from Baldinucci sometime in the late 1670s, with the intent of publishing it while their father was still alive. This would mean that first, the commission did not at all originate in Queen Christina who would have merely lent her name as patron (in order to hide the fact that the biography was coming directly from the family) and secondly, that Baldinucci's narrative was largely derived from some pre-publication version of Domenico Bernini's much longer biography of his father, as evidenced by the extremely large amount of text repeated verbatim (there is no other explanation, otherwise, for the massive amount of verbatim repetition, and it is known that Baldinucci routinely copied verbatim material for his artists' biographies supplied by family and friends of his subjects).<ref>See Mormando, ''Domenico Bernini's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini,'' 2011, pp. 14\u201334. It is significant that Christina's extant financial records nowhere report the queen's having monetarily subsidized the publication of Baldinucci's biography, which would have been her responsibility as patron. As Mormando further explains, we also know (from his extant personal notes and correspondence with his sources) that in compiling his famous collection of artists' lives, Baldinucci routinely copied material, word for word, from texts supplied to him by family members and close friends and associates of his subjects. Also significant is the fact that in Domenico's biography of his father, the author is completely silent about the queen's supposed patronage of the Baldinucci biography, a strange omission since he devotes much space to the friendship between Gian Lorenzo and Queen Christina, recording the queen's many signs of favoritism, protection, and adulation towards the artist.</ref> As the most detailed account and the only one coming directly from a member of the artist's immediate family, Domenico's biography, despite having been published later than Baldinucci's, therefore represents the earliest and more important full-length biographical source of Bernini's life, even though it idealizes its subject and whitewashes a number of less-than-flattering facts about his life and personality.\n\n==Legacy==\nAs one Bernini scholar has summarized, \"Perhaps the most important result of all of the [Bernini] studies and research of these past few decades has been to restore to Bernini his status as the great, principal protagonist of Baroque art, the one who was able to create undisputed masterpieces, to interpret in an original and genial fashion the new spiritual sensibilities of the age, to give the city of Rome an entirely new face, and to unify the [artistic] language of the times.\"<ref>Maria Grazia Bernardini, 'Le radici del barocco,' in ''Barocco a Roma: La meraviglia dell'arte,'' ed. M. G. Bernardini and M. Bussagli [Milan: Skira, 2015], p.32.</ref>   According to the older traditional pious interpretation of his life and artistic goals, his efforts were supposedly so successful in attracting people to prayer by drawing attention to the beauty of God's creation in an intelligible and artistic way that one art historian referred to him as being the \"most powerful advocate of the society of Jesus\". <ref>\"National Gallery of Art.\" Bernini, Gian Lorenzo. Accessed April 06, 2018. https://www.nga.gov/collection/artist-info.2025.html. The quotation, \"most powerful advocate of the Society of Jesus\" refers in reality to the Jesuit Order and is taken from the non-scholarly sectarian website, IgnatianSpirituality.com. [https://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-voices/16th-and-17th-century-ignatian-voices/gianlorenzo-bernini] </ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2018}} Few artists have had as decisive an influence on the physical appearance and emotional tenor of a city as Bernini had with Rome. Maintaining a controlling influence over all aspects of his many and large commissions and over those who aided him in executing them, he was able to carry out his unique and harmoniously uniform vision over decades of work with his long and productive life.<ref>National Gallery of Art.\" Bernini, Gian Lorenzo. Accessed April 06, 2018. https://www.nga.gov/collection/artist-info.2025.html.</ref> Although by the end of Bernini's life there was in motion a decided reaction against his brand of flamboyant Baroque, the fact is that sculptors and architects continued to study his works and be influenced by them for several more decades (Nicola Salvi's later Trevi Fountain [inaugurated in 1735] is a prime example of the enduring post-mortem influence of Bernini on the city's landscape).<ref>Livio Pestilli,\"On Bernini's Reputed Unpopularity in Late Baroque Rome,' ''Artibus et historiae,'' 32.63: 119-42</ref> The reaction against Bernini and the too-sensual, too emotionally charged Baroque in the larger culture (especially in non-Catholic countries of Europe, and particularly in Victorian England) remained in effect until well into the twentieth century (most notable are the public disparagement of Bernini by Francesco Milizia, Joshua Reynolds, and Jacob Burkhardt). Most of the popular eighteenth- and nineteenth-century tourist's guides to Rome all but ignore ignore Bernini and his work, or treat it with disdain, as in the case of the best-selling ''Walks in Rome'' (22 editions between 1871 and 1925) by Augustus J.C. Hare, who describes the angels on the Ponte Sant'Angelo as 'Bernini's Breezy Maniacs.'\n\nBut now in the twenty-first century, Bernini and his Baroque have now been enthusiastically restored to favor, both critical and popular. Since the anniversary year of his birth in 1998, there has hardly been a year in which there has not been at least one major Bernini exhibition somewhere in the world, especially Europe and North America. In the late twentieth century, Bernini was commemorated on the front of the\n[[:File:Lire 50000 (Bernini).JPG|Banca d'Italia 50,000 lire banknote in the 1980s and 90s]]\n(before Italy switched to the euro) with the back showing his equestrian statue of Constantine. Another outstanding sign of Bernini's enduring reputation came in the decision by architect I.M. Pei to insert a faithful copy in lead of his King Louis XIV Equestrian statue as the sole ornamental element in his massive modernist redesign of the entrance plaza to the Louvre Museum, completed to great acclaim in 1989, and featuring the giant [[Louvre Pyramid]] in glass. In 2000 best-selling novelist, [[Dan Brown]], made Bernini and several of his Roman works, the centerpiece of his political thriller, ''[[Angels & Demons]]'', while British novelist [[Iain Pears]] made a missing Bernini bust the centerpiece of his best-selling murder mystery, ''The Bernini Bust'' (2003).\n\n==Selected works==\n{{Main article|List of works by Gian Lorenzo

This includes literature written in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], the German parts of [[Switzerland]] and [[Belgium]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[South Tyrol]] in Italy and to a lesser extent works of the [[German diaspora]]. German literature of the modern period is mostly in [[Standard German]], but there are some currents of literature influenced to a greater or lesser degree by [[German dialects|dialects]] (e.g. [[Alemannic literature|Alemannic]]).\n\nMedieval German literature is [[literature]] written in Germany, stretching from the [[Carolingian dynasty]]; various dates have been given for the end of the German literary Middle Ages, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] (1517) being the last possible cut-off point. The Old High German period is reckoned to run until about the mid-11th century; the most famous works are the ''[[Hildebrandslied]]'' and a heroic epic known as the ''[[Heliand]]''. [[Middle High German]] starts in the 12th century; the key works include ''[[The Ring (poem)|The Ring]]'' (ca. 1410) and the poems of [[Oswald von Wolkenstein]] and [[Johannes von Tepl]]. The Baroque period (1600 to 1720) was one of the most fertile times in German literature. [[history of modern literature|Modern literature]] in German begins with the authors of [[the Enlightenment]] (such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]). The Sensibility movement of the 1750s\u20131770s ended with [[Goethe]]'s best-selling ''[[Die Leiden des jungen Werther]]'' (1774). The [[Sturm und Drang]]  and [[Weimar Classicism]] movements were led by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]]. [[German Romanticism]] was the dominant movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\n[[Biedermeier]] refers to the literature, music, the visual arts and interior design in the period between the years 1815 ([[Vienna Congress]]), the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and 1848, the year of the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions]]. Under the Nazi regime, some authors went into exile (''Exilliteratur'') and others submitted to censorship (\"internal emigration\", ''Innere Emigration''). The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to German language authors thirteen times (as of 2009), or the third most often after English and French language authors (with 27 and 14 laureates, respectively), with winners including [[Thomas Mann]], [[Hermann Hesse]], and [[G\u00fcnter Grass]].\n\n==Periodization==\n\n[[Periodization]] is not an [[exact science]] but the following list contains movements or time periods typically used in discussing German literature. It seems worth noting that the periods of [[medieval]] German literature span two or three centuries, those of early modern German literature span one century, and those of modern German literature each span one or two decades. The closer one nears the present, the more debated the periodizations become.\n\n[[Image:Frenzel.gif|thumb|400px|Graph of works listed in Frenzel, ''Daten deutscher Dichtung'' (1953).

Another important work, in the northern dialect of Old Saxon, is a life of Christ in the style of a heroic epic known as the ''[[Heliand]]''.\n\n===Middle High German===\n\n[[Middle High German]] proper runs from the beginning of the 12th century, and in the second half of the 12th century, there was a sudden intensification of activity, leading to a 60-year \"golden age\" of medieval German literature referred to as the ''mittelhochdeutsche Bl\u00fctezeit'' (1170\u20131230). This was the period of the blossoming of MHG lyric poetry, particularly ''[[Minnesang]]'' (the German variety of the originally French tradition of [[courtly love]]). One of the most important of these poets was [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]. The same sixty years saw the composition of the most important courtly romances. These are written in rhyming couplets, and again draw on French models such as [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]], many of them relating [[Arthurian]] material, for example, ''[[Parzival]]'' by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. The third literary movement of these years was a new revamping of the heroic tradition, in which the ancient Germanic oral tradition can still be discerned, but tamed and Christianized and adapted for the court. These high medieval [[heroic epic]]s are written in rhymed strophes, not the alliterative verse of Germanic prehistory (for example, the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'').\n\nThe Middle High German period is conventionally taken to end in 1350, while the [[Early New High German]] is taken to begin with the [[German Renaissance]], after the invention of movable type in the mid-15th century. Therefore, the literature of the late 14th and the early 15th century falls, as it were, in the cracks between Middle and New High German, and can be classified as either. Works of this transitional period include ''[[The Ring (poem)|The Ring]]'' (c. 1410), the poems of [[Oswald von Wolkenstein]] and [[Johannes von Tepl]], the German versions of ''[[Pontus and Sidonia]]'', and arguably the works of [[Hans Folz]] and [[Sebastian Brant]] (''[[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]]'', 1494), among others. The ''Volksbuch'' ([[chapbook]]) tradition which would flourish in the 16th century also finds its origin in the second half of the 15th century.\n\n==Early Modern period==\n{{further|Early Modern literature|Early Modern history of Germany|Early New High German}}\n\n===German Renaissance and Reformation===\n{{further|German Renaissance|Humanism in Germany|Protestant Reformation}}\n{{further|Early Modern High German}}\n\n* [[Sebastian Brant]] (1457\u20131521)\n* [[Thomas Murner]] (1475\u20131537)\n* [[Philipp Melanchthon]] (1497\u20131560)\n* [[Sebastian Franck]] (1500\u20131543)\n\n===Baroque period===\n\nThe '''Baroque period''' (1600 to 1720) was one of the most fertile times in German literature. Many writers reflected the horrible experiences of the [[Thirty Years' War]], in [[poetry]] and [[prose]]. [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]]'s adventures of the young and na\u00efve Simplicissimus, in the eponymous book ''[[Simplicius Simplicissimus]]''<ref>{{cite book|last=Grimmelshausen|first=H.

[[Andreas Gryphius]] and [[Daniel Caspar von Lohenstein]] wrote German language [[tragedy|tragedies]], or ''Trauerspiele'', often on Classical themes and frequently quite violent. Erotic, religious and [[occasional poetry]] appeared in both German and Latin. [[Sibylle Ursula von Braunschweig-L\u00fcneburg]] wrote part of a novel, ''Die Durchlauchtige Syrerin Aramena'' (''Aramena, the noble Syrian lady''), which when complete would be the most famous courtly novel in German Baroque literature; it was finished by her brother [[Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Anton Ulrich]] and edited by [[Sigmund von Birken]].<ref name=\"Brown2012\">{{cite book|author=Hilary Brown|title=Luise Gottsched the Translator|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVAMccAgim8C&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q=%22most%20famous%20courtly%22&f=false|year=2012|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-510-0|pages=27-}}</ref><ref name=\"Catling2000\">{{cite book|author=Jo Catling|title=A History of Women's Writing in Germany, Austria and Switzerland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaWlLtAwn3cC&pg=PA42|date=23 March 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65628-3|pages=42\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==18th century==\n{{further|History of modern literature}}\n\n===The Enlightenment===\n{{further|The Enlightenment}}\n\n{| width=100%\n| width=50% valign=top |\n* [[August Friedrich Wilhelm Crome]]\n* [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]\n* [[Paul Heinrich Dietrich von Holbach]]\n* [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]]\n* [[Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder|Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel]]\n* [[Immanuel Kant]]\n* [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]\n* [[Moses Mendelssohn]]\n| width=50% valign=top |\n* [[Carl Leonhard Reinhold]]\n* [[Christian Thomasius]]\n* [[Christian Jacob Wagenseil]]\n* [[Christian Felix Wei\u00dfe]]\n* [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]\n* [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]\n* [[Friedrich Nicolai]]\n* [[Christian Garve]]\n|}\n\n===Sensibility===\n''Empfindsamkeit'' / Sensibility  (1750s\u20131770s)\n[[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] (1724\u20131803), [[Christian F\u00fcrchtegott Gellert]] (1715\u20131769), [[Sophie de La Roche]] (1730\u20131807). The period culminates and ends in [[Goethe]]'s  best-selling ''[[Die Leiden des jungen Werther]]'' (1774).\n\n===Sturm und Drang===\n{{main article|Sturm und Drang}}\n\n'''''Sturm und Drang'''''  (the conventional translation is \"Storm and Stress\"; a more literal translation, however, might be ''storm and urge'', ''storm and longing'', or ''storm and impulse'') is the name of a movement in German literature and [[music]] taking place from the late 1760s through the early 1780s in which individual [[subjectivity]] and, in particular, extremes of emotion were given free expression in response to the confines of rationalism imposed by [[the Enlightenment]] and associated [[aesthetic]] movements. The philosopher [[Johann Georg Hamann]] is considered to be the ideologue of ''Sturm und Drang'', and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] was a notable proponent of the movement, though he and [[Friedrich Schiller]] ended their period of association with it, initiating what would become [[Weimar Classicism]].\n\n==19th century==\n\n===German Classicism===\n{{main article|Weimar Classicism}}\n'''Weimar Classicism''' ([[German language|German]] \u201c''Weimarer Klassik''\u201d and \u201c''Weimarer  Klassizismus''\u201d) is a [[cultural movement|cultural]] and [[literary movement]] of [[Europe]], and its central ideas were originally propounded by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller]] during the period 1786 to 1805.\n\n===Romanticism===\n'''[[German Romanticism]]'''  was the dominant movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. German Romanticism developed relatively late compared to its [[English language|English]] counterpart, coinciding in its early years with the movement known as [[German Classicism]] or [[Weimar Classicism]], which it opposed.  In contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety is notable for valuing humor and wit as well as beauty. The early German romantics tried to create a new synthesis of art, philosophy, and science, looking to the [[Middle Ages]] as a  simpler, more integrated period.  As time went on, however, they became increasingly aware of the tenuousness of the unity they were seeking.  Later German Romanticism emphasized the tension between the everyday world and the seemingly irrational and supernatural projections of creative genius.

The term Galilee traditionally refers to the mountainous part, divided into [[Upper Galilee]] ({{lang-he|\u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05df}} ''Galil Elyon'') and [[Lower Galilee]] ({{lang-he|\u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea\u05d5\u05df}} ''Galil Tahton'').\n\nIn the modern common usage, Galilee refers to all of the area that is beyond [[Mount Carmel]] to the northeast, extending from [[Dan (biblical city)|Dan]] to the north, at the base of [[Mount Hermon]], along [[Mount Lebanon]] to the ridges of [[Mount Carmel]] and [[Mount Gilboa]] north of [[Jenin]] to the south, and from the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Rift Valley]] to the east across the plains of the [[Jezreel Valley]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] to the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[coastal plain]] in the west, including [[Beth Shean]]'s valley, [[Sea of Galilee|Sea of Galilee's valley]], and [[Hula Valley]], although it usually does not include [[Haifa]]'s immediate northern suburbs.\n\nBy this definition it overlaps with much of the administrative [[Northern District (Israel)|Northern District]] of the country (which also includes the [[Golan Heights]] and part of [[Menashe Heights]] but not [[Kiryat Tiv'on|Qiryat Tiv'on]]). Western Galilee ({{lang-he|\u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9}} ''Galil Ma'aravi'') is a common term referring to the western part of the Upper Galilee and its shore, and usually also the northwestern part of the Lower Galilee, mostly overlapping with Acre sub district. [[Galilee Panhandle]] is a common term referring to the \"panhandle\" in the east that extends to the north, where Lebanon is to the west, and includes [[Hula Valley]] and [[Ramot Naftali]] mountains of the Upper Galilee. Historically, the part of [[Southern Lebanon]] south of the east-west section of the [[Litani River]] also belonged to the region of Galilee, but the present article mainly deals with the Israeli part of the region.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe region's Israelite name is from the [[Hebrew]] root ''galil'', an ultimately unique word for \"district\", and usually \"cylinder\". The Hebrew form used in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 8:23 (or 9:1 in different Biblical versions) is in the construct state, \"''g'lil hagoyim''\", meaning \"Galilee of the Nations\", i.e. the part of Galilee inhabited by [[Gentile]]s at the time that the book was written.\n\nThe region in turn gave rise to the English name for the \"Sea of Galilee\" referred to as such in many languages including ancient Arabic. In the Hebrew language, the lake is referred to as [[Sea of Galilee|Kinneret]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 34:11, etc.), from Hebrew ''kinnor'', \"[[harp]]\", describing its [[shape]], [[Lake of Gennesaret]] ([[Book of Luke|Luke]] 5:1, etc.), from [[Ginosar]] (Hebrew) ''ge'', \"[[valley]]\", and either ''netser'', \"[[branch]]\", or ''natsor'', \"to guard\", \"to watch\" (the name which may have been a reference to [[Nazareth]] town, alternatively renamed the [[Sea of Tiberias]] ([[Book of John|John]] 6:1, etc.), from the town of [[Tiberias]] at its southwestern end, named after the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] [[Tiberius]] following the first-century CE Roman Emperor's Greek derived name. These are the three names used in originally internal Jewish-authored literature rather than the \"Sea of Galilee\".<ref name= \"Placenames of the World\">Room, Adrian, 2nd Ed.

Several high mountains are in the region, including [[Mount Tabor]] and [[Mount Meron]], which have relatively low temperatures and high rainfall. As a result of this climate, [[flora]] and [[fauna]] thrive in the region, while many birds annually migrate from colder climates to Africa and back through the [[Hula Valley|Hula]]\u2013Jordan corridor. The streams and waterfalls, the latter mainly in Upper Galilee, along with vast fields of greenery and colourful wildflowers, as well as numerous towns of [[biblical]] importance, make the region a popular [[Tourism in Israel|tourist destination]].\n\nDue to its high rainfall {{convert|900|mm|in}}\u2013{{convert|1200|mm|in}}, mild temperatures and high mountains (Mount Meron's elevation is 1,000\u20131,208&nbsp;m), the upper Galilee region contains some distinctive flora and fauna: prickly juniper (''[[Juniperus oxycedrus]]''), Lebanese cedar (''[[Cedrus libani]]''), which grows in a small grove on Mount Meron, [[cyclamen]]s, [[Peony|paeonias]], and ''[[Rhododendron ponticum]]'' which sometimes appears on Meron.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient times===\n[[File:Ancient Galilee.jpg|thumb|170px|Map of Galilee, ''circa'' 50 CE]]\n\nAccording to the [[Bible]], Galilee was named by the Israelites and was the tribal region of Naphthali and Dan, at times overlapping the [[Tribe of Asher]]'s land.<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary\">{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/tribemap.html|title=Map of the Twelve Tribes of Israel &#124; Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=2015-05-18}}</ref> However, Dan was dispersed among the whole people rather than isolated to the lands of Dan, as the Tribe of Dan was the hereditary local law enforcement and judiciary for the whole nation.<ref>Gen. 49:16 earliest reference among others</ref>{{primary source inline|date=August 2013}} Normally,{{when|date=August 2014}} Galilee is just referred to as Naphthali.\n\nChapter 9 of [[1 Kings]] states that [[Solomon]] rewarded his [[Phoenicia]]n ally, [[King Hiram I]] of [[Sidon]], with twenty cities in the land of Galilee, which would then have been either settled by foreigners during and after the reign of Hiram, or by those who had been forcibly deported there by later conquerors such as the [[Assyria]]ns.

During the [[Crusade]]s, Galilee was organized into the [[Principality of Galilee]], one of the most important Crusader seigneuries.\n\n===Ottoman era===\n[[File:Safed view 02.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Safed]]\nDuring Early Ottoman era, the Galilee was governed as the [[Safad Sanjak]], initially part of the larger administrative unit of [[Damascus Eyalet]] (1549\u20131660) and later as part of [[Sidon Eyalet]] (1660\u20131864). During the 18th century, the administrative division of Galilee was renamed to [[Acre Sanjak]], and the Eyalet itself became centered in Acre, factually becoming the Acre Eyalet between 1775 and 1841.\n\nThe Jewish population of Galilee increased significantly following [[Alhambra Decree|their expulsion from Spain]] and welcome from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The community for a time made [[Safed]] an international center of cloth weaving and manufacturing, as well as a key site for Jewish learning.<ref name=\"jafi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/noar/sites/tsfat.htm |title=The Jewish Agency for Israel |publisher=jafi.org.il |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222181345/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/noar/sites/tsfat.htm |archivedate=2009-12-22 |df= }}</ref> Today it remains one of Judaism's [[Four Holy Cities|four holy cities]] and a center for [[kabbalah]].\n\nIn the mid-17th century Galilee and Mount Lebanon became the scene of the [[Druze power struggle (1658\u201367)|Druze power struggle]], which came in parallel with much destruction in the region and decline of major cities.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, Galilee was caught up in a struggle between the [[Arab]] leader [[Zahir al-Umar]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities who were centred in [[Damascus]]. Zahir ruled Galilee for 25 years until Ottoman loyalist [[Jezzar Pasha]] conquered the region in 1775.\n\nIn 1831, the Galilee, a part of [[Ottoman Syria]], switched hands from Ottomans to [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] until 1840. During this period, aggressive social and politic policies were introduced, which led to a violent [[Syrian Peasant Revolt (1834\u201335)|1834 Arab revolt]]. In the process of this revolt the Jewish community of [[Safed]] was greatly reduced, in the event of [[Safed Plunder]] by the rebels. The Arab rebels were subsequently defeated by the Egyptian troops, though in 1838, the Druze of Galilee led another [[1838 Druze rebellion|uprising]]. In 1834 and [[Galilee earthquake of 1837|1837]], major earthquakes leveled most of the towns, resulting in great loss of life.\n\nFollowing the 1864 Tanszimat reforms in the Ottoman Empire, the Galilee remained within [[Acre Sanjak]], but was transferred from [[Sidon Eyalet]] to the newly formed [[Syria Vilayet]] and shortly, from 1888, became administered from [[Beirut Vilayet]].\n\nIn 1866, Galilee's first hospital, [[the Nazareth Hospital]], was founded under the leadership of American-Armenian missionary Dr. [[Kaloost Vartan]], assisted by German missionary [[John Zeller]].\n\n[[File:Beirut Vilayet, Ottoman Empire (1900).svg|thumb|The territory of the Ottoman [[Beirut Vilayet]], encompassing the Galilee]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, Galilee remained part of [[Acre Sanjak]] of Ottoman Syria. It was administered as the southernmost territory of the [[Beirut Vilayet]].\n\n===British administration and Israeli rule===\nFollowing the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in [[World War I]], and the [[Armistice of Mudros]], it came under British rule, as part of the [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]]. Shortly after, in 1920, the region was included in the British Mandate territory, officially a part of Mandatory Palestine from 1923.\n\nAfter the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli war]], nearly the whole of Galilee came under Israel's control. A large portion of the population fled or was forced to leave, leaving dozens of entire villages empty; however, a large [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arab]] community remained based in and near the cities of Nazareth, [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Tamra]], [[Sakhnin]], and [[Shefa-'Amr]], due to some extent to a successful rapprochement with the Druze. The [[kibbutz]]im around the [[Sea of Galilee]] were sometimes shelled by the [[Syrian army]]'s artillery until Israel seized the [[Golan Heights]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].\n\nDuring the 1970s and the early 1980s, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) [[Israel-Lebanon conflict|launched several attacks]] on towns and villages of the Upper and Western Galilee from [[Lebanon]]. Israel initiated [[Operation Litani]] (1979) and [[Operation Peace For Galilee]] (1982) with the stated objectives of destroying the PLO infrastructure in Lebanon and protecting the citizens of the Galilee. Israel occupied much of southern Lebanon until 1985, when it withdrew to a [[Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon|narrow security buffer zone]].\n\nUntil 2000, [[Hezbollah]], and earlier [[Amal Movement|Amal]], continued to fight the [[Israel Defense Forces]], sometimes shelling Upper Galilee communities with [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] rockets. In May 2000, [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli prime minister]] [[Ehud Barak]] unilaterally withdrew IDF troops from southern Lebanon, maintaining a security force on the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Israeli side of the international border]] recognized by the [[United Nations]]. However, clashes between Hezbollah and Israel continued along the border, and UN observers condemned both for their attacks.\n\nThe [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]] was characterized by round-the-clock Katyusha rocket attacks (with a greatly extended range) by Hezbollah on the whole of Galilee, with long-range, ground-launched missiles hitting as far south as the [[Sharon Plain]], [[Jezreel Valley]], and [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] below the Sea of Galilee.\n\n==Demography==\n[[File:Kinneret-moshava.jpg|thumb|250px|Sea of Galilee as seen from the [[Moshava]] [[Kinneret, Israel|Kinneret]]]]\n[[File:GalilSchoolSign.jpg|thumb|200px|Sign in front of the [[Galil Jewish\u2013Arab School]], a joint Arab-Jewish [[Primary education|primary school]] in the Galilee]]\n{{details|Demographics of Israel}}\nThe largest cities in the region are Acre, Nahariya, Nazareth, Safed, [[Karmiel]], [[Shaghur]], [[Shefa-'Amr]], [[Afula]], and Tiberias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Places To Visit In Israel|url=http://www.govisitisrael.com/haifa/150/|publisher=govisitisrae|accessdate=2013-07-25}}</ref> The port city of [[Haifa]] serves as a commercial center for the whole region.\n\nBecause of its hilly terrain, most of the people in the Galilee live in small villages connected by relatively few roads.<ref>{{cite web|title=Galilee in Jesus' Time Was a Center of Change|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/biblearchaeology/a/041511-CW-Galilee-In-Jesus-Time-Was-A-Center-Of-Change.htm|publisher=Ancient History|accessdate=2013-07-25}}</ref> A railroad runs south from [[Nahariya]] along the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean coast]], and a fork to the east is due to operate in 2015.

The Galilee attracts many [[Christian pilgrimage|Christian pilgrims]], as many of the [[miracles of Jesus]] occurred, according to the [[New Testament]], on the shores of the Sea of Galilee\u2014including [[Jesus walks on water|his walking on water]], [[calming the storm]], and [[feeding the multitude|feeding five thousand people]] in [[Tabgha]]. In addition, numerous sites of [[biblical]] importance are located in the Galilee, such as [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], Jezreel Valley, Mount Tabor, [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Horns of Hattin]], and more.\n\nA popular hiking trail known as the ''yam leyam'', or sea-to-sea, starts hikers at the Mediterranean. They then hike through the Galilee mountains, Tabor, Neria, and Meron, until their final destination, the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee).\n\nIn April 2011, Israel unveiled the \"[[Jesus Trail]]\", a 40-mile (60-km) [[hiking trail]] in the Galilee for Christian pilgrims. The trail includes a network of footpaths, roads, and bicycle paths linking sites central to the lives of Jesus and his disciples, including [[Tabgha]], the traditional site of Jesus' miracle of the loaves and fishes, and the [[Mount of Beatitudes]], where he delivered his Sermon on the Mount. It ends at [[Capernaum]] on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus espoused his teachings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/israel-unveils-hiking-trail-galilee-christian-pilgrims-20110415-093756-814.html |accessdate=2011-05-16 |date=April 15, 2011 |title=Israel unveils hiking trail in Galilee for Christian pilgrims |author=Daniel Estrin, Canadian Press |publisher=[[Yahoo!

The meals are lighter than in the central and southern regions. Dairy products are heavily consumed (especially the Safed cheese that originated in the mountains of the [[Upper Galilee]]). Herbs like thyme, mint, parsley, basil, and rosemary are very common with everything including dips, meat, fish, stews and cheese.\nIn the eastern part of the Galilee, freshwater fish as much as meat (especially the tilapia that lives in the Sea of Galilee, Jordan river, and other streams in the region), fish filled with thyme and grilled with rosemary to flavor, or stuffed with oregano leaves, then topped with parsley and served with lemon to squash. This technique exists in other parts of the country including the coasts of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. A specialty of the region is a baked Tilapia flavored with celery, mint and a lot of lemon juice. Baked fish with tahini is also common in Tiberias while the coastal Galileans prefer to replace the tahini with yogurt and add sumac on top.\n\nThe Galilee is famous for its olives, pomegranates, wine and especially its [[Labneh]] w'[[Za'atar]] which is served with pita bread, meat stews with wine, pomegranates and herbs such as akub, parsley, [[Malva|khalmit]], mint, fennel, etc. are common. Galilean [[kibbeh|kubba]] is usually flavored with cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, concentrated [[pomegranate juice]], onion, parsley and pine nuts and served as meze with tahini dip.\nKebabs are also made almost in the same way with sumac replacing cardamom and with carob sometimes replacing the pomegranate juice.\nBecause of its climate, beef has become more popular than lamb, although both are still eaten there.\nDates are popular in the tropical climate of the Eastern Galilee.\n\n==Subregions==\nThe Galilee is often divided into these subregions:\n* '''[[Lower Galilee]]''' covers the area north of the Valleys ([[Jezreel Valley|Jezreel]], [[Harod Valley|Harod]] and [[Beth Shean Valley]]) and south of the [[Beit HaKerem Valley]].

At the request of emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], Theoderic conquered all of Italy from the [[Scirii|Scirian]] [[Odoacer]] beginning in 488. The Goths were briefly reunited under one crown in the early 6th century under Theoderic, who became regent of the Visigothic kingdom following the death of [[Alaric II]] at the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]] in 507. Procopius interpreted the name ''Visigoth'' as \"western Goths\" and the name ''Ostrogoth'' as \"eastern Goth\", reflecting the geographic distribution of the Gothic realms at that time.\n\nThe [[Ostrogothic kingdom]] persisted until 553 under [[Teia]], when Italy returned briefly to Byzantine control. This restoration of imperial rule was reversed by the conquest of the [[Lombards]] in 568. Shortly after Theoderic's death, the country was conquered by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]] that devastated and depopulated the peninsula.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Sc6k5YCymvwC&pg=PA11&dq=gothic+war+million+casualties#v=onepage&q=15%2C000%2C000&f=false|title=The Human Drift|last=London|first=Jack|publisher=1st World Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4218-3371-2|page=11}}</ref> In 552, after their leader [[Totila]] was killed at the [[Battle of Taginae]] (552), effective Ostrogothic resistance ended, and the remaining Goths in Italy were assimilated by the [[Lombards]], another Germanic tribe, who invaded Italy and founded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] in 567 AD.\n\nIn the late 18th century, Gothic tribes who remained in the lands around the Black Sea, especially in [[Crimea]] - then known as [[Crimean Goths]] - were still mentioned as existing in the region and speaking a [[Crimean Gothic]] dialect, making them the last true Goths.

They developed a [[polychrome]] style of gold work, using wrought cells or setting to encrust [[gemstone]]s into their gold objects. This style was influential in West Germanic areas well into the Middle Ages.\n\n===Language===\n{{Main article|Gothic language|Gothic alphabet}}\nThe [[Gothic language]] is the [[Germanic language]] with the earliest attestation, from the 300s, making it a language of interest in [[comparative linguistics]]. All other [[East Germanic languages]] are known, if at all, from proper names that survived in historical accounts, and from loan-words in other languages. It is known primarily from the [[Codex Argenteus]], a translation of the Bible. The language was in decline by the mid-500s, due to the military victory of the [[Franks]], the elimination of the Goths in Italy, and geographic isolation. In Spain the language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the Visigoths converted to Catholicism in 589).<ref name=\"Pohl119-21\">{{cite book|title=Strategies of Distinction: Construction of Ethnic Communities, 300\u2013800 (Transformation of the Roman World|first=Walter|last=Pohl|isbn=978-90-04-10846-2|pages=119\u201321|year=1998}}.</ref> It is now an [[extinct language]].\n\n[[File:Mas\u0142om\u0119cz grave 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Reconstruction of the 3rd century Gothic grave from [[Mas\u0142om\u0119cz]] in the [[Lublin Museum]].]]\n\n=== Society ===\nArchaeological evidence in Visigothic cemeteries shows that social stratification was analogous to that of the village of [[Sabbas the Goth]].

They sowed wheat, barley, rye, and flax. They also raised pigs, poultry, and goats. Horses and donkeys were raised as working animals, and fed with hay. Sheep were raised for their wool, which they fashioned into clothing. Archaeology indicates they were skilled potters and blacksmiths.

Imports from Rome included wine and cooking-oil.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Visigoths' Peasant Economy|url=http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/27.html|website=Magyar Elektronikus K\u00f6nyvt\u00e1r|accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Further information|Gothic Christianity}}\nInitially practising [[Gothic paganism]], the Goths were gradually converted to [[Arian Christianity]] in the course of the 4th&nbsp;Century as a result of the missionary activity by the Gothic bishop [[Wulfila]], who devised a Gothic alphabet to translate the [[Wulfila Bible]].\n\nDuring the 370s, Goths converting to Christianity were subject to [[Gothic persecution of Christians|persecution]] by the remaining pagan authorities of the [[Thervingi]] people.\n\nThe [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in [[Hispania]] converted to Catholicism in the 7th&nbsp;Century.\n\nThe Ostrogoths (and their remnants, the [[Crimean Goths]]) were closely connected to the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] from the 5th&nbsp;Century, and became fully incorporated under the [[Metropolitanate of Gothia]] from the 9th&nbsp;Century.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Don Pelayo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|In Spain, the Visigothic nobleman [[Pelagius of Asturias]] who founded the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and began the [[Reconquista]] at the [[Battle of Covadonga]], is a national hero regarded as the country's first monarch.]]\nThe Gotlanders themselves had oral traditions of a mass migration towards southern Europe, recorded in the [[Gutasaga]]. If the facts are related, this would be a unique case of a tradition that endured for more than a thousand years and that actually pre-dates most of the major splits in the Germanic language family.\n\nThe Goths' relationship with Sweden became an important part of Swedish nationalism, and, until the 19th&nbsp;Century, the Swedes were commonly considered to be the direct descendants of the Goths. Today, Swedish scholars identify this as a [[cultural movement]] called [[Gothicismus]], which included an enthusiasm for things [[Old Norse]].\n\nGothic language and culture largely disappeared during the [[Middle Ages]], although its influence continued in small ways in some western European states. As late as the 16th&nbsp;century a small number of people in the [[Crimea]] may still have spoken [[Crimean Gothic]].<ref>{{cite book|title=An Introduction to the Gothic Language|last=Bennett|first=William H|year=1980|page=27}}\n</ref>\n\nThe language survived as a domestic language in the [[Iberian peninsula]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) as late as the 8th&nbsp;Century, and Frankish author [[Walafrid Strabo]] wrote that it was still spoken in the lower Danube area and that Crimean Gothic was spoken in isolated mountain regions in Crimea in the early 9th century. Gothic-seeming terms found in later (post-9th century) manuscripts may not belong to the same language.\n\nIn [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Medieval]] and Modern Spain, the Visigoths were believed to be the origin of the [[Spanish nobility]] (compare [[Gobineau]] for a similar French idea). By the early 7th&nbsp;Century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th&nbsp;Century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles did service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).<ref name=\"Pohl 124-6\">{{cite book|title=Strategies of Distinction: Construction of Ethnic Communities, 300\u2013800 (Transformation of the Roman World)|first=Walter|last=Pohl|isbn=978-90-04-10846-2|pages=124\u20136|year=1998}}.</ref>\n\nIn [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and the [[Canary Islands]], ''godo'' was an [[ethnic slur]] used against European Spaniards, who in the early colony period often felt superior to the people born locally (''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|criollos]]''). In [[Colombia]], the members of the [[Colombian Conservative Party]] were referred to as ''godos''.\n\nThe Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434. Before the assembled [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and delegations could engage in theological discussion, they had to decide how to sit during the proceedings. The delegations from the more prominent nations argued that they should sit closest to the [[Pope]], and there were also disputes over who were to have the finest chairs and who were to have their chairs on mats. In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths. The Spanish delegation retorted that it was only the \"lazy\" and \"unenterprising\" Goths who had remained in Sweden, whereas the \"heroic\" Goths had left Sweden, invaded the Roman empire and settled in Spain.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/samlaren/1896/0195.html S\u00f6derberg, Werner.

Most monosaccharides, such as [[fructose]] and [[galactose]], can be converted to one of these intermediates. The intermediates may also be directly useful. For example, the intermediate [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] (DHAP) is a source of the glycerol that combines with fatty acids to form fat.\n\nGlycolysis is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway.

The most common type of glycolysis is the ''Embden&ndash;Meyerhof&ndash;Parnas (EMP pathway)'', which was discovered by [[Gustav Embden]], [[Otto Meyerhof]], and [[Jakub Karol Parnas]]. Glycolysis also refers to other pathways, such as the ''[[Entner\u2013Doudoroff pathway]]'' and various heterofermentative and homofermentative pathways.

In the cellular environment, all three hydroxyl groups of ADP dissociate into \u2212O<sup>\u2212</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>, giving ADP<sup>3\u2212</sup>, and this ion tends to exist in an ionic bond with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, giving ADPMg<sup>\u2212</sup>.  ATP behaves identically except that it has four hydroxyl groups, giving ATPMg<sup>2\u2212</sup>.  When these differences along with the true charges on the two phosphate groups are considered together, the net charges of \u22124 on each side are balanced.\n\nFor simple [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentations]], the metabolism of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate has a net yield of two molecules of ATP. Most cells will then carry out further reactions to 'repay' the used NAD<sup>+</sup> and produce a final product of [[ethanol]] or [[lactic acid]]. Many bacteria use inorganic compounds as hydrogen acceptors to regenerate the NAD<sup>+</sup>.\n\nCells performing [[aerobic respiration]] synthesize much more ATP, but not as part of glycolysis. These further aerobic reactions use [[pyruvate]] and NADH '''+''' H<sup>+</sup> from glycolysis. Eukaryotic aerobic respiration produces approximately 34 additional molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule, however most of these are produced by a vastly different mechanism to the [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] in glycolysis.\n\nThe lower-energy production, per glucose, of anaerobic respiration relative to aerobic respiration, results in greater flux through the pathway under hypoxic (low-oxygen) conditions, unless alternative sources of anaerobically oxidizable substrates, such as fatty acids, are found.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

CO<sub>2</sub> production increased rapidly then slowed down. Harden and Young noted that this process would restart if an inorganic phosphate (Pi) was added to the mixture. Harden and Young deduced that this process produced organic phosphate esters, and further experiments allowed them to extract fructose diphosphate (F-1,6-DP).\n\n[[Arthur Harden]] and [[William John Young|William Young]] along with Nick Sheppard determined, in a second experiment, that a heat-sensitive high-molecular-weight subcellular fraction (the enzymes) and a heat-insensitive low-molecular-weight cytoplasm fraction (ADP, ATP and NAD<sup>+</sup> and other [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]]) are required together for fermentation to proceed. This experiment begun by observing that dialyzed (purified) yeast juice could not ferment or even create a sugar phosphate. This mixture was rescued with the addition of undialyzed yeast extract that had been boiled. Boiling the yeast extract renders all proteins inactive (as it denatures them). The ability of boiled extract plus dialyzed juice to complete fermentation suggests that the cofactors were non-protein in character.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Otto_Fritz_Meyerhof.jpg|thumb|Otto Meyerhof.

This reaction consumes ATP, but it acts to keep the glucose concentration low, promoting continuous transport of glucose into the cell through the plasma membrane transporters. In addition, it blocks the glucose from leaking out &ndash; the cell lacks transporters for G6P, and free diffusion out of the cell is prevented due to the charged nature of G6P. Glucose may alternatively be formed from the [[phosphorolysis]] or [[hydrolysis]] of intracellular starch or glycogen.\n\nIn [[animal]]s, an [[isozyme]] of hexokinase called [[glucokinase]] is also used in the liver, which has a much lower affinity for glucose (K<sub>m</sub> in the vicinity of normal glycemia), and differs in regulatory properties. The different substrate affinity and alternate regulation of this enzyme are a reflection of the role of the liver in maintaining blood sugar levels.\n\n''Cofactors:''\nMg<sup>2+</sup>\n{{clear}}{{hr}}\n\n{{Float box|{{Enzymatic Reaction\n|forward_enzyme=[[Phosphoglucose isomerase]] ('''PGI''')<br />''an [[isomerase]]''\n|reverse_enzyme=\n|substrate=\u03b1-<small>D</small>-[[Glucose 6-phosphate]] ('''G6P''')\n|product=\u03b2-<small>D</small>-[[Fructose 6-phosphate]] ('''F6P''')\n|reaction_direction_(forward/reversible/reverse)=reversible\n|minor_forward_substrate(s)=\n|minor_forward_product(s)=\n|minor_reverse_substrate(s)=\n|minor_reverse_product(s)=\n|substrate_image=Alpha-D-glucose-6-phosphate wpmp.svg\n|product_image=Beta-D-fructose-6-phosphate wpmp.png\n}}}}\nG6P is then rearranged into [[fructose 6-phosphate]] (F6P) by [[glucose phosphate isomerase]]. [[Fructose]] can also enter the glycolytic pathway by phosphorylation at this point.\n\nThe change in structure is an isomerization, in which the G6P has been converted to F6P. The reaction requires an enzyme, phosphoglucose isomerase, to proceed. This reaction is freely reversible under normal cell conditions. However, it is often driven forward because of a low concentration of F6P, which is constantly consumed during the next step of glycolysis. Under conditions of high F6P concentration, this reaction readily runs in reverse. This phenomenon can be explained through [[Le Chatelier's Principle]].  Isomerization to a keto sugar is necessary for carbanion stabilization in the fourth reaction step (below).\n{{clear}}{{hr}}\n\n{{Float box|{{Enzymatic Reaction\n|forward_enzyme=[[Phosphofructokinase 1|phosphofructokinase]] ('''PFK-1''')<br />''a [[transferase]]''\n|reverse_enzyme=\n|substrate=\u03b2-<small>D</small>-[[Fructose 6-phosphate]] ('''F6P''')\n|product=\u03b2-<small>D</small>-[[Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate]] ('''F1,6BP''')\n|reaction_direction_(forward/reversible/reverse)=forward\n|minor_forward_substrate(s)= ATP\n|minor_forward_product(s)= H<sup>+</sup> + ADP\n|minor_reverse_substrate(s)=\n|minor_reverse_product(s)=\n|substrate_image=Beta-D-fructose-6-phosphate wpmp.png\n|product_image=beta-D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate_wpmp.svg\n}}}}\n\nThe energy expenditure of another ATP in this step is justified in 2 ways: The glycolytic process (up to this step) becomes irreversible, and the energy supplied destabilizes the molecule. Because the reaction catalyzed by [[Phosphofructokinase 1]] (PFK-1) is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP (an energetically favorable step) it is, in essence, irreversible, and a different pathway must be used to do the reverse conversion during [[gluconeogenesis]]. This makes the reaction a key regulatory point (see below).  This is also the rate-limiting step.\n\nFurthermore, the second phosphorylation event is necessary to allow the formation of two charged groups (rather than only one) in the subsequent step of glycolysis, ensuring the prevention of free diffusion of substrates out of the cell.\n\nThe same reaction can also be catalyzed by [[PFP (enzyme)|pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase]] ('''PFP''' or '''PPi-PFK'''), which is found in most plants, some bacteria, archea, and protists, but not in animals. This enzyme uses pyrophosphate (PPi) as a phosphate donor instead of ATP. It is a reversible reaction, increasing the flexibility of glycolytic metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Reeves| first = R. E. |author2=South D. J. |author3=Blytt H. J. |author4=Warren L.

Instead of continuing through the glycolysis pathway, this intermediate can be converted into glucose storage molecules, such as [[glycogen]] or [[starch]].  The reverse reaction, breaking down, e.g., glycogen, produces mainly glucose-6-phosphate; very little free glucose is formed in the reaction.  The glucose-6-phosphate so produced can enter glycolysis ''after'' the first control point.\n\nIn the second regulated step (the third step of glycolysis), [[phosphofructokinase]] converts fructose-6-phosphate into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, which then is converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

The internal factors that  regulate glycolysis do so primarily to provide [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in adequate quantities for the cell\u2019s needs. The external factors act primarily on the [[liver]], [[Adipose tissue|fat tissue]], and [[muscle]]s, which can remove large quantities of glucose from the blood after meals (thus preventing [[hyperglycemia]] by storing the excess glucose as fat or glycogen, depending on the tissue type). The liver is also capable of releasing glucose into the blood between meals, during fasting, and exercise thus preventing [[hypoglycemia]] by means of [[glycogenolysis]] and [[gluconeogenesis]]. These latter reactions coincide with the halting of glycolysis in the liver.\n\nIn animals, regulation of blood glucose levels by the pancreas in conjunction with the liver is a vital part of [[homeostasis]].

Excess [[citrate]] is exported from the mitochondrion back into the cytosol, where [[ATP citrate lyase]] regenerates [[acetyl-CoA]] and [[Oxaloacetic acid|oxaloacetate]] (OAA). The [[acetyl-CoA]] is then used for [[fatty acid synthesis]] and [[Cholesterol|cholesterol synthesis]], two important ways of utilizing excess glucose when its concentration is high in blood. The rate limiting enzymes catalyzing these reactions perform these functions when they have been dephosphorylated through the action of insulin on the liver cells.

This causes liver glycogen to be converted back to G6P, and then converted to glucose by the liver-specific enzyme [[glucose 6-phosphatase]] and released into the blood. Glucagon and epinephrine also stimulate gluconeogenesis, which coverts non-carbohydrate substrates into G6P, which joins the G6P derived from glycogen, or substitutes for it when the liver glycogen store have been depleted.

In the liver, when blood sugar is low and [[glucagon]] elevates cAMP, [[PFK2]] is phosphorylated by [[protein kinase A]]. The phosphorylation inactivates [[PFK2]], and another domain on this protein becomes active as [[fructose bisphosphatase-2]], which converts F2,6BP back to F6P. Both [[glucagon]] and [[epinephrine]] cause high levels of cAMP in the liver. The result of lower levels of liver fructose-2,6-bisphosphate is a decrease in activity of [[phosphofructokinase]] and an increase in activity of [[fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase]], so that gluconeogenesis (in essence, \"glycolysis in reverse\") is favored. This is consistent with the role of the liver in such situations, since the response of the liver to these hormones is to release glucose to the blood.\n\n[[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] competes with [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]] for the allosteric effector site on the PFK enzyme.

These controls prevent pyruvate kinase from being active at the same time as the enzymes that catalyze the reverse reaction ([[pyruvate carboxylase]] and [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]]), preventing a [[futile cycle]].\n\n== Post-glycolysis processes ==\nThe overall process of glycolysis is:\n\n:Glucose + 2 NAD<sup>+</sup> + 2 ADP + 2 P<sub>i</sub> \u2192 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 H<sup>+</sup> + 2 ATP + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nIf glycolysis were to continue indefinitely, all of the NAD<sup>+</sup> would be used up, and glycolysis would stop. To allow glycolysis to continue, organisms must be able to oxidize NADH back to NAD<sup>+</sup>. How this is performed depends on which external electron acceptor is available.\n\n=== Anoxic regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup>===\nOne method of doing this is to simply have the pyruvate do the oxidation; in this process, pyruvate is converted to [[lactic acid|lactate]] (the [[conjugate base]] of lactic acid) in a process called [[lactic acid fermentation]]:\n\n:Pyruvate + NADH + H<sup>+</sup> \u2192 Lactate + NAD<sup>+</sup>\n\nThis process occurs in the [[bacterium|bacteria]] involved in making [[yogurt]] (the lactic acid causes the milk to curdle). This process also occurs in animals under hypoxic (or partially anaerobic) conditions, found, for example, in overworked muscles that are starved of oxygen. In many tissues, this is a cellular last resort for energy; most animal tissue cannot tolerate anaerobic conditions for an extended period of time.\n\nSome organisms, such as yeast, convert NADH back to NAD<sup>+</sup> in a process called [[ethanol fermentation]].  In this process, the pyruvate is converted first to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide, and then to ethanol.\n\n[[Lactic acid fermentation]] and [[ethanol fermentation]] can occur in the absence of oxygen.  This anaerobic fermentation allows many single-cell organisms to use glycolysis as their only energy source.\n\nAnoxic regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup> is only an effective means of energy production during short, intense exercise in vertebrates, for a period ranging from 10 seconds to 2 minutes during a maximal effort in humans. (At lower exercise intensities it can sustain muscle activity in [[Mammalian diving reflex|diving animals]], such as seals, whales and other aquatic vertebrates, for very much longer periods of time.) Under these conditions NAD<sup>+</sup> is replenished by NADH donating its electrons to pyruvate to form lactate. This produces 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, or about 5% of glucose's energy potential (38 ATP molecules in bacteria). But the speed at which ATP is produced in this manner is about 100 times that of oxidative phosphorylation. The pH in the cytoplasm quickly drops when hydrogen ions accumulate in the muscle, eventually inhibiting the enzymes involved in glycolysis.\n\nThe burning sensation in muscles during hard exercise can be attributed to the release of hydrogen ions during the shift to glucose fermentation from glucose oxidation to carbon dioxide and water, when aerobic metabolism can no longer keep pace with the energy demands of the muscles. These hydrogen ions form a part of lactic acid. The body falls back on this less efficient but faster method of producing ATP under low oxygen conditions. This is thought to have been the primary means of energy production in earlier organisms before oxygen reached high concentrations in the atmosphere between 2000 and 2500 million years ago (see diagram above right), and thus would represent a more ancient form of energy production than the aerobic replenishment of NAD<sup>+</sup> in cells.\n\nThe liver in mammals gets rid of this excess lactate by transforming it back into pyruvate under aerobic conditions; see [[Cori cycle]].\n\nFermentation of pyruvate to lactate is sometimes also called \"anaerobic glycolysis\", however, glycolysis ends with the production of pyruvate regardless of the presence or absence of oxygen.\n\nIn the above two examples of fermentation, NADH is oxidized by transferring two electrons to pyruvate.  However, anaerobic bacteria use a wide variety of compounds as the terminal electron acceptors in [[cellular respiration]]: nitrogenous compounds, such as nitrates and nitrites; sulfur compounds, such as sulfates, sulfites, sulfur dioxide, and elemental sulfur; carbon dioxide; iron compounds; manganese compounds; cobalt compounds; and uranium compounds.\n\n=== Aerobic regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup>, and disposal of pyruvate===\nIn [[aerobic organism]]s, a complex mechanism has been developed to use the oxygen in air as the final electron acceptor.\n* Firstly, the  [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH + H<sup>+</sup>]] generated by glycolysis has to be transferred to the mitochondrion to be oxidized, and thus to regenerate the NAD<sup>+</sup> necessary for glycolysis to continue. However the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup>.<ref name=stryer5>{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Oxidative phosphorylation. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

They are the [[malate-aspartate shuttle]] and the [[glycerol phosphate shuttle]]. In the former the electrons from NADH are transferred to cytosolic [[Oxaloacetic acid|oxaloacetate]] to form [[Malic acid|malate]]. The malate then traverses the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is reoxidized by NAD<sup>+</sup> forming intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate and NADH. The oxaloacetate is then re-cycled to the cytosol via its conversion to aspartate which is readily transported out of the mitochondrion. In the glycerol phosphate shuttle electrons from cytosolic NADH are transferred to [[dihydroxyacetone]] to form [[glycerol-3-phosphate]] which readily traverses the outer mitochondrial membrane. Glycerol-3-phosphate is then reoxidized to dihydroxyacetone, donating its electrons to [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]] instead of NAD<sup>+</sup>.<ref name=stryer5 /> This reaction takes place on the inner mitochondrial membrane, allowing FADH<sub>2</sub> to donate its electrons directly to coenzyme Q ([[ubiquinone]]) which is part of the [[electron transport chain]] which ultimately transfers electrons to molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), with the formation of water, and the release of energy eventually captured in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].\n* The glycolytic end-product, pyruvate (plus NAD<sup>+</sup>) is converted to [[acetyl-CoA]], CO<sub>2</sub> and NADH + H<sup>+</sup> within the [[mitochondria]] in a process called [[pyruvate decarboxylation]].\n* The resulting acetyl-CoA enters the [[citric acid cycle]] (or Krebs Cycle), where the acetyl group of the acetyl-CoA is converted into carbon dioxide by two decarboxylation reactions with the formation of yet more intra-mitochondrial NADH + H<sup>+</sup>.\n* The intra-mitochondrial NADH + H<sup>+</sup> is oxidized to NAD<sup>+</sup> by the [[electron transport chain]], using oxygen as the final electron acceptor to form water.  The energy released during this process is used to create a hydrogen ion (or proton) gradient across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.\n* Finally, the proton gradient is used to produce about 2.5 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for every NADH + H<sup>+</sup> oxidized in a process called [[oxidative phosphorylation]].<ref name=stryer5 />\n\n===Conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol===\nThe pyruvate produced by glycolysis is an important intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrates into [[fatty acids]] and [[cholesterol]].<ref name=stryer2>{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Fatty acid metabolism. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

Hence the addition of oxaloacetate greatly increases the amounts of all the citric acid intermediates, thereby increasing the cycle's capacity to metabolize acetyl CoA, converting its acetate component into CO<sub>2</sub> and water, with the release of enough energy to form 11 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and 1 [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] molecule for each additional molecule of acetyl CoA that combines with oxaloacetate in the cycle.<ref name=stryer3 />\n\nTo cataplerotically remove oxaloacetate from the citric cycle, [[malate]] can be transported from the mitochondrion into the cytoplasm, decreasing the amount of oxaloacetate that can be regenerated.<ref name=stryer3 /> Furthermore, citric acid intermediates are [[Citric acid cycle#Citric acid cycle intermediates serve as substrates for biosynthetic processes|constantly used to form a variety of substances such as the purines, pyrimidines and porphyrins]].<ref name=stryer3 />\n\n== Intermediates for other pathways ==\nThis article concentrates on the [[catabolic]] role of glycolysis with regard to converting potential chemical energy to usable chemical energy during the oxidation of glucose to pyruvate.

NADH is rarely used for synthetic processes, the notable exception being [[gluconeogenesis]].  During [[Fatty acid metabolism#Fatty acid Synthesis|fatty acid]] and [[Cholesterol#Biosyntesis|cholesterol synthesis]] the reducing agent is [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]]. This difference exemplifies a general principle that NADPH is consumed during biosynthetic reactions, whereas NADH is generated in energy-yielding reactions.<ref name=stryer0 /> The source of the NADPH is two-fold. When [[Malic acid|malate]] is oxidatively decarboxylated by \u201cNADP<sup>+</sup>-linked malic enzyme\" [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]], CO<sub>2</sub> and NADPH are formed.

However, the low insulin levels seen in diabetes result in hyperglycemia, where glucose levels in the blood rise and glucose is not properly taken up by cells. Hepatocytes further contribute to this hyperglycemia through [[gluconeogenesis]]. Glycolysis in hepatocytes controls hepatic glucose production, and when glucose is overproduced by the liver without having a means of being broken down by the body, hyperglycemia results.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2012-08-01|title=Glycolysis in the control of blood glucose homeostasis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221138351200086X|journal=Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=358\u2013367|doi=10.1016/j.apsb.2012.06.002|issn=2211-3835}}</ref>\n\n=== Genetic diseases ===\nGlycolytic mutations are generally rare due to importance of the metabolic pathway, this means that the majority of occurring mutations result in an inability for the cell to respire, and therefore cause the death of the cell at an early stage.

a town in the province of [[Biscay]], in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Autonomous Community of the Basque Country]], Spain. The town of Guernica is united in one [[municipality]] with neighbouring Lumo, as '''Gernika-Lumo'''. The population of the municipality is 16,224 {{As of|2009|lc=y}}.\n\nGernika is best known to those residing outside the Basque region as the scene of the April 26, 1937, [[Bombing of Guernica]], one of the first [[strategic bombing|aerial bombing]]s by [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Luftwaffe]]. It inspired the painting ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'' by [[Pablo Picasso]].\n\n==Location==\nThis village is situated at 10m altitude, in the region of [[Busturialdea]], in the valley of the [[Oca (river)|Oka river]]. Its mouth is known to be [[Urdaibai estuary|Urdaibai's estuary's]] heart. Gernika makes border with the following townships:\n\n* North: [[Forua]], [[Kortezubi]] and [[Arratzu]].\n* East: [[Ajangiz]]\n* South: [[Muxika]]\n* West: [[Errigoiti]]\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe town of Guernica was founded by Count Tello on April 28, 1366, at the intersection of the road from [[Bermeo]] to [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]] with the road from [[Bilbao]] to [[Elantxobe]] and [[Lekeitio]]. The strategic importance of the site was increased by the fact that it lay on a major river estuary, where vessels could dock at the port of Suso. \n\n\nIn time, it took on the typical shape of a Basque town, comprising a series of parallel streets (Goienkale, Azokekale, Artekale and Barrenkale) and a transverse street called Santa Mar\u00eda, with a church at each end of the built-up area.\n\nLife in the town became rigidly structured, with the aim being to preserve the privileges of the dominant middle classes. This pattern continued practically unaltered until the late 17th century.\n\nOn a small [[hillock]] in the town, stands the Meeting House and the famous [[Gernikako Arbola|Tree of Gernika]]. By ancient tradition, Basques, and indeed other peoples in Medieval Europe, held assemblies under a tree, usually an oak, to discuss matters affecting the community.\n\nIn Biscay, each administrative district (known as a [[merindad]]) had its appointed tree, but over the centuries, the Tree of Guernica acquired particular importance. It stood in the parish of Lumo, on a site known as Gernikazarra, beside a small shrine.\n\nThe laws of Biscay continued to be drawn up under this tree until 1876, with each town and village in the province sending two representatives to the sessions, known as [[Juntas Generales|General Assemblies]]. This early form of democracy was recorded by the philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], by the poet [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]], by the dramatist [[Tirso de Molina]] and by the composer Iparragirre, who wrote the piece called [[Gernikako Arbola (anthem)|Gernikako Arbola]].\n\nWhen the Domain of Biscay was incorporated into the kingdom of Castile, the king of Castile visited Guernica and swore an oath under the Tree promising to uphold the fueros or local laws of Biscay. The oath of King Ferdinand, known as the \"Catholic Monarch\", on June 30, 1476, is depicted in a painting by Francisco de Mendieta popularly known as El besamanos (\"The Royal audience\"). On July 3, 1875, during the [[Carlist Wars]], the pretender to the throne [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Don Carlos]] of the house of Hapsburg also visited Guernica and swore the oath. Throughout the 19th century, there were frequent meetings under the Tree, including both General Assemblies and other political events.\n\nBy the 18th century, there was a square at the centre of the town, flanked by the town hall, a public gaol housing prisoners from all over the [[Lord of Biscay|Lordship of Biscay]], a hospital and a poor-house for local people. Day-to-day life comprised agriculture (growing of cereals, vegetable and fruit), crafts (menders, tailors, cobblers, flax manufacturers) and trade (transportation and sale of goods and produce).\n\nThis was also a time of continual conflicts with the neighbouring parish of Lumo over disputed land. These disputes were not finally settled until 1882, when the two parishes joined together to form Gernika-Lumo.\n\nThe first industrial concerns were set up in the early years of the 20th century. This encouraged population growth, and the town grew from 4,500 inhabitants in 1920 to 6,000 in 1936.\n\n===Modern history===\nOn April 26, 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], Guernica was the scene of the [[Bombing of Guernica]] by the [[Condor Legion]] of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and the Italian [[Aviazione Legionaria]]. According to the official Basque figures, 1,654 civilians were killed, but the German sources report a round figure of 300 civilians killed in the bombing, according to the German ''Bundeswehr Magazine'' (published in April 2007, page 94).{{Full citation needed|date=September 2013}} The raid was requested by [[Francisco Franco]] to overthrow the [[Lehendakari|Basque]] Government and the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]an government.  The town was devastated, though the Biscayan assembly and the Oak of Guernica survived. The Bombing of Guernica is considered the beginning of the Luftwaffe doctrine of terror bombing, where civilian targets were selected to demoralize the enemy.<ref>http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/the-spanish-civil-war/guernica/</ref> [[Pablo Picasso]] painted his famous [[Guernica (painting)|''Guernica'' painting]] to commemorate the horrors of the bombing and [[Ren\u00e9 Ich\u00e9]] made a violent sculpture the day after the bombing. The bombing went on continuously for three hours.\n\nCelebrations were staged in 1966 to mark the 600th anniversary of the founding of the town. As part of these celebrations a statue of Count Tello, made by local sculptor Agust\u00edn Herranz, was set up in the Fueros square.\n\nAt present Gernika-Lumo has 16,244 (2009) inhabitants. It is a town with a prosperous service sector which is also home to industrial companies and has good cultural and educational amenities.\n\n==Cultural importance==\nGuernica is historically the seat of the [[Juntas Generales|parliament of the province of Biscay]], whose executive branch is located in nearby [[Bilbao]].\n\nIn prior centuries, Lumo had been the meeting place of the [[Fueros|traditional]] Biscayan assembly, [[Ordu\u00f1a|Urdu\u00f1a]] and [[municipal charter|chartered towns]] like Guernica were under the direct authority of the [[Lord of Biscay]], and [[Enkarterri]] and the [[Durango, Biscay|Durango area]] had separate assemblies. All would hold assemblies under local big trees. As time passed, the role of separate assemblies was superseded by the single assembly in Guernica, and by 1512, its oak, known as the [[Gernikako Arbola]], became symbolic of the traditional rights of the [[Basque people]] as a whole.\n\nThe trees are always renewed from their own acorns. One of these trees (the \"Old Tree\") lived until the 19th century, and may be seen, as a dry stump, near the assembly house. A tree planted in 1860 to replace it died in 2004 and was in turn replaced; the sapling that had been chosen to become the official Oak of Guernica is also sick so the tree will not be replaced until the earth around the site has been restored to health.\n\nA hermitage was built beside the Gernikako Arbola to double as an assembly place, followed by the current house of assembly (''Biltzar Jauregia'' in [[Basque language|Basque]]), built in 1826.\n\n==Symbol for peace==\nOn April 26, 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, the town was razed to the ground by German aircraft belonging to the [[Condor Legion]], sent by Hitler to support Franco's troops. For almost four hours bombs rained down on Guernica in an \"experiment\" for the blitzkrieg tactics and bombing of civilians seen in later wars.\n\nIn 1987 the 50th anniversary of the bombing was commemorated as the town hosted the Preliminary Congress of the World Association of Martyr Cities. The full congress was held subsequently in Madrid, bringing together representatives of cities all over the world. Since then, Gernika-Lumo has been a member of this association. 1988 saw the setting up of the monument ''Gure Aitaren Etxea'', by Basque sculptor [[Eduardo Chillida]], and in 1990 ''Large Figure in a Shelter'', by British sculptor [[Henry Moore]], was erected beside it. These monuments are symbolic of Gernika-Lumo as a city of peace.\n\nAs part of the \"Symbol for Peace\" movement, Gernika has twinned with several towns, including [[Berga]] (Catalonia \u2014 1986), [[Pforzheim]] (Germany \u2014 1988) and [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], Idaho (United States \u2014 1993). The twinning agreements include co-operation in the fields of culture, education and industry.\n\n==Market day ==\nThere is a popular saying in Guernica which runs as follows: \"lunes gerniqu\u00e9s, golperik ez\". This translates roughly as \"not a stroke of work gets done on Mondays\". The Monday market day has for decades been considered as a holiday in the town.\n\n[[File:Cestapuntista suelo.jpg|left|200px|thumb|A cesta-punta player]]\n\nPeople would flock to Guernica not just from the immediate vicinity, but from all over the province, so that the town was packed. They came not just to buy or sell at the produce market, but also to eat at the town's renowned restaurants and afterwards perhaps to watch a pelota game at the local court. The Monday market has been fulfilling its age-old function of bringing people together since the times when people could not afford to travel far and it provided them with a chance to socialise.\n\n[[File:Puestos del \u00faltimo lunes.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Guernica marketplace]]\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main|Basque rural sports}}\n[[Jai alai]] (cesta-punta) is a form of [[Basque pelota|pelota]]. The Guernica jai alai court is the biggest operational court of its type in the world. It was designed by Secundino Zuano, one of Spain's leading architects of the 20th century and first opened in 1963. It is acknowledged by players of the game to be the world's finest court.\n\nBare-handed pelota games are held at the Santanape court. This is the most popular form of the sport.\n\n==Main sights==\n[[File:Tr\u00edptico iglesia andra mari.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Santa Mar\u00eda Church]]\n*Parish Church of Santa Mar\u00eda. Work on this church, at the top of the town, began in 1418 in a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, and continued non-stop until 1625, though the finishing touches were not completed until 1715, in the Renaissance period.\n[[File:Arbol viejo noche.jpg|left|300px|thumb|The tree of Guernica]]\n* Church of Santa Mar\u00eda de la Antigua. Built in 1826-33 by Antonio de Echevarr\u00eda in the purest [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-classical]] style, this building <!-- contains within it the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua, which [a church inside itself?] --> is currently used as the plenary meeting hall of the General Assemblies of Biscay.\n*''Large Figure in a Shelter'' (1986) by the sculptor [[Henry Moore]]. This sculpture is typical of the themes and style of this artist, and the most significant example of his \"inside/outside\" motif. Cast in bronze, it weighs around 20 tonnes.\n*Monument to Peace, by the Basque sculptor [[Eduardo Chillida]]. This figure, set up on April 27, 1988, was commissioned by the Basque Government to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Guernica. The title in Basque{{clarify|What ''is'' the title in Basque?|date=November 2016}} means \"Our Father's House\", and the work stands looking towards the Tree (the symbol of Basque traditions and history) as a monument to peace.\n*Park of the Peoples of Europe. This contains examples of all four types of woodland found on the Basque coast: beech woods, oak woods, holm-oak woods and riverside brush. It is also the site of  Moore's and Chillida's sculptures and Humboldt's bronze head.{{clarify|What is \"Humboldt's bronze head\"? Not mentioned elsewhere in article.|date=November 2016}}\n*Palacio de Alegr\u00eda mansion. This mansion was rebuilt in its entirety in the mid-18th century. All that remains of the earlier building is a loop-hole and one window. It is built in the typical urban Baroque style with an ashlar-work fa\u00e7ade, trellised balconies and the coat of arms of the Allende Salazar family. The mansion now houses the Museum of the Basque Country, whose exhibits highlight physical, political, economic and linguistic features of Basque history and renowned Basque personages.\n*Guernica Peace Museum Foundation, a museum of the history of Guernica. The exhibits illustrate what Guernica has represented throughout its history for the Basques (democracy, local legal system, freedom) and what it stands for today all over the world (human rights, peace). The Gernika Peace Museum is a theme museum setting out the culture of peace. It was inspired by the tragic bombing of Guernica on 26 April 1937.\n*Euskal Herria Museum, housed in the palace of Alegr\u00eda or Montefuerte, a 1733 baroque reconstruction of an ancient medieval tower. Set in the historical heart of Gernika-Lumo, it survived the 1937 bombing. The Museum is located near the Casa de Juntas (old Assembly House) and the Tree of Guernica, and surrounded by old gardens now turned into the Parque de los Pueblos de Europa (Park of the European Nations). The Regional Council of Biscay acquired the site in 1982 and refurbished it as a Museum with the aim of presenting an exhibition to promote the understanding of the historical, political and cultural meaning of the spiritual community of Euskal Herria.\n*Reproduction of Picasso's ''Guernica''. A mosaic of tiles which depicts in puzzle form Picasso's great work ''Guernica'', the original of which is currently on display at the [[Reina Sofia Museum]] in Madrid. The inscription beneath this impressive mural expresses the desire of local people for the original canvas to be put on display in the town which inspired its creation: Guernica.\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\n{{col-begin}}\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Pforzheim]], Germany\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Boise, Idaho]], United States\n{{col-end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Municipal elections in Gernika-Lumo]]\n*[[Bombing of Guernica]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Bombing of Gernika}}\n{{Commons category|Gernika-Lumo}}\n*[http://www.gernika-lumo.net Official site] in English, Basque and Spanish\n*[http://www.begonyaplaza.com/begonya_plaza/2007/03/gernika_lives.html writer and filmmaker Begonya Plaza interviewed survivors, and people of importance in Guernica in 1987 in documentary \"GERNICA LIVES\"]\n*[http://aestheticrealism.org/art-opposes-injustice-picassos-guernica-for-life/ Painter and art educator Dorothy Koppelman writes \"Art Opposes Injustice: Picasso\u2019s Guernica\"]\n* [http://www.euskomedia.org/euskomedia/SAunamendi?idi=en&op=7&voz=GERNIKA-LUMO GERNIKA-LUMO in the Bernardo Estorn\u00e9s Lasa - Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia (Euskomedia Fundazioa)] {{es icon}}\n* [http://www.gernika-lumo.net/es-ES/Recursos/Paginas/default.aspx/ Web page about Gernika-Lumo with great photos of it.]\n\n<!--Navigation box--><br />\n{{Municipalities in Biscay}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guernica (Town)}}\n[[Category:Municipalities in Biscay]]\n[[Category:Spanish Civil War]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Biscay]]\n[[Category:Guernica| ]]", "sha1": "pbcuucokwcx249tmsqls7o8rlazo6z9"}}, {"title": "Gerrit Rietveld", "ns": "0", "id": "12648", "revision": {"id": "866596672", "parentid": "866596669", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T09:59:01Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/91.196.28.6|91.196.28.6]] to version by Shellwood.

One of the principal members of the Dutch artistic movement called [[De Stijl]], Rietveld is famous for his [[Red and Blue Chair]] and for the [[Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House]], which is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n==Biography==\nRietveld was born in [[Utrecht]] in 1888 as the son of a [[joiner]]. He left school at 11 to be apprenticed to his father and enrolled at night school<ref>Alice Rawthorn (October 17, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/arts/18iht-design18.html Design\u2019s Odd Man Out Gets Moment in the Sun] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> before working as a [[draughtsman]] for C.

He afterwards set up in business as a cabinet-maker.<ref name=\"autogenerated237\">Fleming, John, et al. (1972) ''The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture''; 2nd ed. Harmondsworth: Penguin; pp. 237-38</ref>\n\nRietveld designed his [[Red and Blue Chair]] in 1917 which has become an iconic piece of modern furniture. Hoping that much of his furniture would eventually be mass-produced rather than handcrafted, Rietveld aimed for simplicity in construction.<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=4044 ''Red Blue Chair'' (1923)] Museum of Modern Art, New York.</ref> In 1918, he started his own furniture factory, and changed the chair's colours after becoming influenced by the ''[[De Stijl]]'' movement, of which he became a member in 1919, the same year in which he became an architect. The contacts that he made at ''De Stijl'' gave him the opportunity to exhibit abroad as well. In 1923, [[Walter Gropius]] invited Rietveld to exhibit at the [[Bauhaus]].<ref>Rita Reif (October 13, 1988), [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/13/garden/rietveld-an-esthetic-wellspring.html Rietveld, an Esthetic Wellspring] ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> He built, the [[Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House]], in 1924, in close collaboration with the owner [[Truus Schr\u00f6der-Schr\u00e4der]]. Built in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] on the Prins Hendriklaan 50, the house has a conventional ground floor, but is radical on the top floor, lacking fixed walls but instead relying on sliding walls to create and change living spaces. The design seems like a three-dimensional realization of a [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] painting.{{fact|date=October 2018}} The house has been a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 2000. His involvement in the Schr\u00f6der House exerted a strong influence on Truus' daughter, [[Han Schr\u00f6der]], who became one of the first female architects in the Netherlands.<ref>[http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/inventories/schroder/schroder.htm \"Han Schroeder: Architectural Papers, 1926-1998\"], ''International Archive of Women in Architecture''. Retrieved 28 February 2012.</ref>\n\nRietveld broke with ''De Stijl'' in 1928 and became associated with a more functionalist style of architecture, known as either [[Nieuwe Zakelijkheid]] or [[Nieuwe Bouwen]]. The same year he joined the [[Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]. From the late 1920s he was concerned with social housing, inexpensive production methods, new materials, prefabrication and standardisation. In 1927 he was already experimenting with prefabricated concrete slabs, a very unusual material at that time. In the 1920s and 1930s, however, all his commissions came from private individuals, and it was not until the 1950s that he was able to put his progressive ideas about social housing into practice, in projects in Utrecht and Reeuwijk.<ref>[http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=13910&lang=en Gerrit Rietveld - Biography] [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723220719/http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=13910&lang=en |date=July 23, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nRietveld designed the [[Zig-Zag Chair]] in 1934 and started the design of the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]], which was finished after his death.\n\nIn 1951 Rietveld designed a retrospective exhibition about ''De Stijl'' which was held in Amsterdam, Venice and New York. Interest in his work revived as a result. In subsequent years he was given many commissions, including the Dutch pavilion for the [[Venice Biennale]] (1953), the art academies in Amsterdam and Arnhem, and the press room for the [[UNESCO]] building in Paris. Designed for the display of small sculptures at the Third International Sculpture Exhibition in Arnhem\u2019s Sonsbeek Park in 1955, Rietveld's \u2018Sonsbeek Pavilion\u2019 was rebuilt at the [[Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum]] in 1965.<ref>[http://www.kmm.nl/statue-garden?lang=en Sculpture Garden at the Kr\u00f6ller M\u00fcller Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911234408/http://www.kmm.nl/statue-garden?lang=en |date=September 11, 2014 }}</ref> Due to irreparable damages caused by regular decay, it was once again rebuilt, this time with new materials, in 2010.

It was a prosperous city from the 1920s through the mid-1960s due to its booming steel industry, but overseas competition and restructuring of the steel industry resulted in a decline and a severe loss of jobs. A history of political corruption, racial segregation, labor unrest, and violence gave way to problems exacerbated by the city's declining economy and infrastructure.\n\nSince the late 1960s, Gary has suffered drastic population loss, falling by 55 percent from its peak of 178,320 in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/gary-indiana-is-deteriorating-badly-2013-6|work=Business Insider|accessdate=2014-04-06|date=2013-06-20|first=Pamela|last=Engel|title=Gary, Indiana Is Deteriorating So Much That It May Cut Off Services To Nearly Half Of Its Land}}</ref> The city faces the difficulties of many [[Rust Belt]] cities, including unemployment, decaying infrastructure, and low literacy and educational attainment levels.

The city was named after lawyer [[Elbert Henry Gary]], who was the founding chairman of the United States Steel Corporation.\n\nGary was the site of civil unrest in the [[steel strike of 1919]]. On October 4, 1919, a riot broke out on Broadway, the main north-south street through downtown Gary, between striking steel workers and strike breakers brought in from outside. Three days later, Indiana governor [[James P. Goodrich]] declared martial law. Shortly thereafter, over 4,000 federal troops under the command of Major General [[Leonard Wood]] arrived to restore order.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=S. Paul|title=Gary, the most American of all American cities|date=2011|publisher=Indiana Univ. Press|location=Bloomington, Ind. [u.a.]|isbn=9780253222886}}</ref>\n\nThe jobs offered by the steel industry provided Gary with very rapid growth and a diverse population within the first 26 years of its founding. According to the [[1920 United States Census]], 29.7% of Gary's population at the time was classified as foreign-born, mostly from eastern European countries, with another 30.8% classified as native-born with at least one foreign-born parent. By the [[1930 United States Census]], the first census in which Gary's population exceeded 100,000, the city was the fifth largest in Indiana and comparable in size to [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], and [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]]. At that time, 19.3% of the population was classified as foreign-born, with another 25.9% as native-born with at least one foreign-born parent. In addition to white internal migrants, Gary had attracted numerous African-American migrants from the South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], and 17.8% of the population was classified as black. 3.5% was classified as Mexican (now likely to be identified as Hispanic, as some were likely American citizens in addition to immigrants).\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:U.S. STEEL PLANT - NARA - 547097 (retouched).jpg|thumb|left|[[U.S. Steel]]'s [[Gary Works]] in 1973]]\nGary's fortunes have risen and fallen with those of the steel industry. The growth of the steel industry brought prosperity to the community. Broadway was known as a commercial center for the region. Department stores and architecturally significant movie houses were built in the downtown area and the Glen Park neighborhood.\n\nIn the 1960s, like many other American urban centers reliant on one particular industry, Gary entered a spiral of decline. Gary's decline was brought on by the growing overseas competitiveness in the steel industry, which had caused U.S. Steel to lay off many workers from the Gary area. The U.S. Steel Gary Works employed over 30,000 in 1970, declined to just 6,000 by 1990, and further declined to 5,100 in August 2015. Attempts to shore up the city's economy with major construction projects, such as a [[Holiday Inn]] hotel and the [[Genesis Convention Center]], failed to reverse the decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2013/06/08/the-abandoned-sheraton-hotel-of-gary-indiana/|title=The Sheraton Hotel of Gary, Indiana|date=2013-06-08|publisher=Sometimes Interesting}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/02/how-gary-indiana-got-serious-about-tackling-blight/386159/|title=How Gary, Indiana, Got Serious About Tackling Blight|author=Chris Bentley|date=2015-02-26|publisher=City Lab}}</ref>\n\nRapid racial change occurred in Gary during the late 20th century. These population changes resulted in political change which reflected the racial demographics of Gary: the non-white share of the city's population increased from 21% in 1930, 39% in 1960, to 53% in 1970. Non-whites were primarily restricted to live in the Midtown section just south of downtown (per the 1950 Census, 97% of the black population of Gary was living in this neighborhood). Gary had one of the nation's first African-American mayors, [[Richard G.

In the 1960s through the 1980s, surrounding suburban localities such as [[Merrillville, Indiana|Merrillville]], [[Crown Point, Indiana|Crown Point]], Hobart and Valparaiso experienced rapid growth, including new homes and shopping districts. Owing to [[white flight]], economic distress, and a perception of skyrocketing crime, many middle-class and affluent residents moved to other cities in the metro area.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Gary had the highest percentage of African-Americans of U.S. cities with a population of 100,000 or more, 84% (as of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. census]]). This no longer applies to Gary since the population of the city has now fallen well below 100,000 residents. As of 2013, the Gary Department of Redevelopment has estimated that one-third of all homes in the city are unoccupied and/or abandoned.<ref>{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=November 2013 |title=Harper's Index |journal=[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]] |publisher=Harper's Foundation |volume=327 |issue=1,962 |page=17 |url=http://harpers.org/archive/2013/11/harpers-index-355/ |accessdate=December 30, 2013 }}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\nU.S. Steel continues to be a major steel producer, but with only a fraction of its former level of employment. While Gary has failed to reestablish a manufacturing base since its population peak, two casinos opened along the Gary lakeshore in the 1990s, although this has been aggravated by the state closing of [[Indiana State Road 912|Cline Avenue]], an important access to the area. Today, Gary faces the difficulties of a [[Rust Belt]] city, including unemployment, decaying infrastructure, and low literacy and educational attainment levels.\n\n===Recent history===\nGary has closed several of its schools within the last ten years. While some of the school buildings have been reused, most remain unused since their closing. As of 2014, Gary is considering closing additional schools in response to budget deficits.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carlson|first=Carole|title=Gary ponders closing schools to save money|url=http://posttrib.suntimes.com/news/lake/25659467-418/gary-ponders-closing-schools-to-save-money.html|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=Post Tribute|date=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714104642/http://posttrib.suntimes.com/news/lake/25659467-418/gary-ponders-closing-schools-to-save-money.html|archive-date=July 14, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"For sale: 11 schools, slightly used in Gary\">{{cite web|last=Kirk|first=Chelsea|title=For sale: 11 schools, slightly used in Gary|url=http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.net/main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID=77&ArticleID=54914|publisher=Indiana Economic Digest|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nGary chief of police Thomas Houston was convicted of excessive force and abuse of authority in 2008; he died in 2010 while serving a three-year, five-month federal prison sentence.<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2008/September/08-crt-870.html #08-870: Gary, Indiana Former Police Chief Convicted on Federal Civil Rights Violation (September 30, 2008)].

Originally, the City of Gary consisted of The East Side, The West Side, The South Side (the area south of the train tracks near 9th Avenue), and Glen Park, located further South along Broadway. The East Side was demarcated by streets named after the States in order of their acceptance into the Union. This area contained mostly wood-frame houses, some of the earliest in the city, and became known in the 20th century for its ethnic populations from Europe and large families. The single-family houses had repeating house designs that alternated from one street to another, with some streets looking very similar. Among the East Side's most notable buildings were Memorial Auditorium (a large red-brick and stone civic auditorium and the site of numerous events, concerts and graduations), The Palace Theater, Emerson School, St. Luke's Church, H.C. Gordon & Sons, and Goldblatt's Department stores, in addition to the Fair Department Store. All fronted Broadway as the main street that divided Gary.\n\nThe West Side of Gary, or West of Broadway, the principal commercial street, had streets named after the presidents of the United States in order of their election. Lytton's, Hudson's ladies store, J.C. Penney, and Radigan Bros Furniture Store developed on the west side of Broadway. Developed later, this side of town was known for its masonry or brick residences, its taller and larger commercial buildings, including the Gary National Bank Building, Hotel Gary (now Genesis Towers), The Knights of Columbus Hotel & Building (now a seniors building fronting 5th Avenue), the Tivoli Theater (demolished), the U.S. Post Office, Main Library, Mercy and Methodist Hospitals and Holy Angels Cathedral and School. The West Side also had a secondary principal street, Fifth Avenue, which was lined with many commercial businesses, restaurants, theaters, tall buildings, and elegant apartment buildings. The West Side was viewed as having wealthier residents. The houses dated from about 1908 to the 1930s. Much of the West Side's housing were for executives of U.S. Steel and other prominent businessmen. Notable mansions were 413 Tyler Street and 636 Lincoln Street. Many of the houses were on larger lots. By contrast, a working-class area was made up of row houses made of poured concrete were arranged together and known as \"Mill Houses\"; they were built to house steel mill workers.\n\nThe areas known as Emerson and Downtown West combine to form Downtown Gary. It was developed in the 1920s and houses several pieces of impressive architecture, including the Moe House <!-- what is disputed about it? -->, designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and another, the [[Wilbur Wynant House|Wynant House]] (1917), which was destroyed by fire. A significant number of older structures have been demolished in recent years because of the cost of restoration. Restructuring of the steel and other heavy industry in the late 20th century resulted in a loss of jobs, adversely affecting the city.\n\nAbandoned buildings in the downtown area include historic structures such as [[Union Station (Gary, Indiana)|Union Station]], the [[Palace Theater (Gary, Indiana)|Palace Theater]], and [[City Methodist Church (Gary, Indiana)|City Methodist Church]]. A large area of the downtown neighborhood (including City Methodist) was devastated by a major fire on October 12, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.preserveindiana.com/mainpages/editorials.html#anchor461882 |title=Indiana Historic Architecture Editorials |publisher=Preserveindiana.com |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Blaze Hits Downtown Gary|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-10-13/news/9710140270_1_fire-buildings-senior-citizens|accessdate=April 24, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 13, 1997}}</ref> Interstate 90 was constructed between downtown Gary and the United States Steel plant.\n\n===West===\n[[Ambridge Mann]] is a neighborhood located on Gary's near west side along 5th Avenue. Ambridge was developed for workers at the nearby steel plant in the 1910s and 1920s. It is named after the American Bridge Works, which was a subsidiary of U.S. Steel. The neighborhood is home to a huge stock of prairie-style and art deco homes. The Gary Masonic Temple is located in the neighborhood, along with the Ambassador apartment building. Located just south of [[Interstate 90]], the neighborhood can be seen while passing Buchanan Street.\n\n[[File:Gary Centennial Landmark.jpg|thumb|Gary Centennial Landmark]]\n[[Brunswick (Gary)|Brunswick]] is located on Gary's far west side. The neighborhood is located just south of Interstate 90 and can also be seen from the expressway. The Brunswick area includes the Tri-City Plaza shopping center on West 5th Avenue (U.S. 20). The area is south of the [[Gary Chicago International Airport]].\n\n[[Downtown West (Gary)|Downtown West]] is located in north-central Gary on the west side of Broadway just south of [[Interstate 90]]. The [[Genesis Convention Center]], the [[Gary Police Department]], the Lake Superior Court House, and the Main Branch of the Gary Public Library are located along 5th Avenue. A new 123-unit mixed-income apartment development was built using a [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] Hope VI grant in 2006. The [[Adam Benjamin Metro Center]] is located just north of 4th Avenue. It is operated by the [[Gary Public Transportation Corporation]] and serves as a multi-modal hub. It serves both as the Downtown Gary South Shore train station and an intercity bus stop.\n\n[[Tolleston]] is one of Gary's oldest neighborhoods, predating much of the rest of the city. It was platted by George Tolle in 1857, when the railroads were constructed to this area. This area is west of Midtown and south of Ambridge Mann. Tarrytown is a subdivision located in Tolleston between Whitcomb Street and Clark Road.\n\n===South===\n[[Black Oak (Gary)|Black Oak]] is located on the far southwest side of Gary, in the vicinity of the Burr Street exit to the [[Borman Expressway]]. It was annexed in the 1970s. Prior to that, Black Oak was an unincorporated area informally associated with [[Hammond, Indiana|Hammond]], and the area has Hammond telephone numbers. After three referendums, the community voters approved annexation, having been persuaded by Mayor Hatcher that they would benefit more from services provided by the city than from those provided by the county. In the 20th-century, it is the only majority-white neighborhood in Gary.\n\n[[Glen Park (Gary)|Glen Park]] is located on Gary's far south side and is made up mostly of mid-twentieth-century houses. Glen Park is divided from the remainder of the city by the Borman Expressway. The northern portion of Glen Park is home to Gary's Gleason Park Golf Course and the campus of [[Indiana University Northwest]]. The far western portion of Glen Park is home to the Village Shopping Center. Glen Park includes the 37th Avenue corridor at Broadway.\n\n[[Midtown (Gary)|Midtown]] is located south of Downtown Gary, along Broadway. In the pre-1960s days of ''de facto'' segregation, this developed historically as a \"black\" neighborhood as African Americans came to Gary from the rural South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to seek jobs in the industrial economy.\n\n===North and East===\n[[File:Gary Indiana P9190219 Miller School (Dist 8).JPG|thumb|Old Miller School, District #8]]\n[[File:Wells Street Beach Miller Beach.JPG|thumb|Wells Street Beach in Miller]]\n[[Aetna (Gary)|Aetna]] is located on Gary's far east side along the [[Dunes Highway]]. Aetna predates the city of Gary. This [[company town]] was founded in 1881 by the Aetna Powder Works, an explosives company. Their factory closed after the end of World War&nbsp;I.\n\nThe Town of Aetna was annexed by Gary in 1928, around the same time that the city annexed the Town of Miller. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Gary's prosperous industries helped generate residential and other development in Aetna, resulting in an impressive collection of [[art deco]] architecture. The rest of the community was built after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, in a series of phases. On its south and east, Aetna borders the undeveloped floodplain of the [[Little Calumet River]].\n\n[[Emerson (Gary)|Emerson]] is located in north-central Gary on the east side of Broadway. Located just south of [[Interstate 90]], Gary City Hall is located in Emerson, along with the Indiana Department of Social Services building and the Calumet Township Trustee's office. A 6,000-seat minor league baseball stadium for the [[Gary SouthShore RailCats]], [[U.S. Steel Yard]], was constructed in 2002, along with contiguous commercial space and minor residential development.\n\n[[Miller Beach]], also known as Miller Station or simply as Miller, is on Gary's far east side. Incorporated as an independent town in 1907, Miller was annexed by the city of Gary in 1918. Miller developed around the old stagecoach stop and train station known by the 1840s as Miller's Junction. The Miller Beach area has remained somewhat separated from the rest of Gary both culturally and geographically.\n\nMiller Beach is racially and economically diverse. It attracts investor interest due to the many year-round and summer homes within walking distance of [[Marquette Park (Gary)|Marquette Park]] and [[Lake Michigan]]. Prices for lakefront property are affordable compared to those in Illinois suburban communities. Lake Street provides shopping and dining options for Miller Beach visitors and residents. East Edge, a development of 28 upscale condominium, townhome, and single-family homes, began construction in 2007 at the eastern edge of Miller Beach along County Line Road, one block south of Lake Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.net/main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID=146&ArticleID=26330 |title=It's Miller's time in Lake County|publisher=''Indiana Economic Digest'' |date=April 16, 2006 |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe city is located at the southern end of the former lake bed of the prehistoric [[Lake Chicago]], and the current [[Lake Michigan]]. Most of the city's soil, to nearly one foot below the surface, is pure sand. The sand beneath Gary, and on its beaches, is of such high quality that in years past it was mined for the manufacture of glass.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Gary has a total area of {{convert|57.18|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|49.87|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 87.22%) is land and {{convert|7.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 12.78%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1827000\n  |title=G001 - Geographic Identifiers - 2010 Census Summary File 1\n  |accessdate=2015-07-28\n  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref>\n\nGary is \"T\" shaped, with its northern border on [[Lake Michigan]]. At the northwesternmost section, Gary borders [[Hammond, Indiana|Hammond]] and [[East Chicago]].

In July and August, the warmest months, high temperatures average 84&nbsp;\u00b0F (29&nbsp;\u00b0C) and peak just above 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C), and low temperatures average 63&nbsp;\u00b0F (17&nbsp;\u00b0C). In January and February, the coldest months, high temperatures average around 29&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22122&nbsp;\u00b0C) and low temperatures average 13&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221211&nbsp;\u00b0C), with at least a few days of temperatures dipping below 0&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nThe weather of Gary is greatly regulated by its proximity to [[Lake Michigan]]. Weather varies yearly. In summer months Gary is humid. The city's yearly precipitation averages about 40&nbsp;inches. Summer is the rainiest season. Winters vary but are predominantly snowy. Snowfall in Gary averages approximately 25&nbsp;inches per year. Sometimes large blizzards hit because of \"[[lake effect snow]]\", a phenomenon whereby large amounts of water evaporated from the lake deposit onto the shoreline areas as inordinate amounts of snow.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Gary, Indiana\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  70\n|Feb record high F =  70\n|Mar record high F =  81\n|Apr record high F =  92\n|May record high F = 100\n|Jun record high F = 106\n|Jul record high F = 104\n|Aug record high F = 102\n|Sep record high F = 103\n|Oct record high F =  92\n|Nov record high F =  84\n|Dec record high F =  67\n|year record high F =106\n|Jan high F = 31.5\n|Feb high F = 35.2\n|Mar high F = 44.7\n|Apr high F = 58.4\n|May high F = 69.1\n|Jun high F = 79.6\n|Jul high F = 83.8\n|Aug high F = 82.5\n|Sep high F = 75.5\n|Oct high F = 64.6\n|Nov high F = 48.5\n|Dec high F = 35.8\n|year high F =59.1\n|Jan low F = 16.5\n|Feb low F = 19.9\n|Mar low F = 29.0\n|Apr low F = 40.0\n|May low F = 49.7\n|Jun low F = 59.9\n|Jul low F = 64.9\n|Aug low F = 63.9\n|Sep low F = 56.0\n|Oct low F = 45.7\n|Nov low F = 33.2\n|Dec low F = 21.9\n|year low F =41.7\n|Jan record low F = \u221222\n|Feb record low F = \u221210\n|Mar record low F =  \u22126\n|Apr record low F =  17\n|May record low F =  25\n|Jun record low F =  36\n|Jul record low F =  46\n|Aug record low F =  43\n|Sep record low F =  33\n|Oct record low F =  20\n|Nov record low F =  \u22121\n|Dec record low F = \u221217\n|year record low F= \u221222\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 1.8\n|Feb precipitation inch = 1.7\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.3\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.7\n|May precipitation inch = 3.8\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.5\n|Jul precipitation inch = 3.5\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.4\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.9\n|Oct precipitation inch = 2.6\n|Nov precipitation inch = 2.5\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.0\n|year precipitation inch=37.8\n|Jan snow inch = 7.8\n|Feb snow inch = 5.4\n|Mar snow inch = 3.0\n|Apr snow inch = 0.7\n|May snow inch = 0\n|Jun snow inch = 0\n|Jul snow inch = 0\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 0\n|Oct snow inch = 0.2\n|Nov snow inch = 1.7\n|Dec snow inch = 5.9\n|year snow inch =24.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 in\n|Jan precipitation days =  9\n|Feb precipitation days =  9\n|Mar precipitation days = 11\n|Apr precipitation days = 12\n|May precipitation days = 12\n|Jun precipitation days = 10\n|Jul precipitation days =  9\n|Aug precipitation days =  8\n|Sep precipitation days =  9\n|Oct precipitation days =  8\n|Nov precipitation days = 10\n|Dec precipitation days =  9\n|year precipitation days=116\n|source 1 = Weatherbase<ref name = weatherbase >\n{{cite web\n  |url = http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=89937&units=us\n  |title = Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Gary, Indiana\n  |publisher = Weatherbase\n  |accessdate = February 18, 2013\n}}</ref>\n|source 2 =<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idcide.com/weather/in/gary.htm |title=Gary Weather &#124; Gary IN &#124; Conditions, Forecast, Average |publisher=Idcide.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-22}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\nThe change in the economy and resulting loss of jobs has caused a drop in population by more than half since its peak in 1960. \n{{US Census population\n|1910= 16802\n|1920= 55378\n|1930= 100666\n|1940= 111719\n|1950= 133911\n|1960= 178320\n|1970= 175415\n|1980= 151968\n|1990= 116646\n|2000= 102746\n|2010= 80294\n|estyear=2017\n|estimate=76008\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2017\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2017.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"U.S. Decennial Census\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6G4J8TS75?url=http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 22, 2013|df=mdy}}</ref><br>2010 Estimate<ref name=\"census.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2013/SUB-EST2013-3.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522161634/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2013/SUB-EST2013-3.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 22, 2014|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=July 11, 2014 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the census<ref name=\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> of 2010, there were 80,294 people, 31,380 households, and 19,691 families residing in the city.

Gregory narrowly escaped execution with the help of Sopia and Yevtagh, his caretakers. He was taken to [[Kayseri|Caesarea]] in [[Cappadocia]] where Sopia and Yevtagh hoped to raise him. Gregory was given to the Christian Holy Father Phirmilianos (Euthalius) to be educated and was brought up as a devout Christian.\n\nUpon coming of age, Gregory married a woman called Miriam, a devout Christian who was the daughter of a Christian Armenian Prince in Cappadocia. From their union, Miriam bore Gregory two children, their sons [[St. Vrtanes I|Vrtanes]] and [[St. Aristaces I|Aristaces]]. Through Vrtanes, Gregory and Miriam would have further descendants and when Gregory died, Aristaces succeeded him. At some point Miriam and Gregory separated in order that Gregory might take up a monastic life. Gregory left Cappadocia and went to Armenia in the hope of atoning for his father's crime by evangelizing his homeland.{{sfn|Kurkjian, ''A History of Armenia'', p. 97}}\n\nAt that time [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]], son of the late King [[Khosrov II of Armenia|Khosrov II]], reigned. Influenced partly by the fact that Gregory was the son of his father's enemy, he ordered Gregory imprisoned for twelve (some sources indicate fourteen) years in a pit on the Ararat Plain under the present day church of [[Khor Virap]] located near the historical city [[Artashat (ancient city)|Artashat]] in [[Armenia]]. Gregory was eventually called forth from his pit in c. 297 to restore to sanity Tiridates III, who had lost all reason after he was betrayed by [[Roman emperor]] [[Diocletian]]. Diocletian invaded and vast amounts of territory from western provinces of Greater Armenia became protectorates of Rome.\n\n==Declaration of Christianity in Armenia==\nIn 301 Gregory baptized Tiridates III along with members of the royal court and upper class as Christians. Tiridates III issued a decree by which he granted Gregory full rights to begin carrying out the conversion of the entire nation to the Christian faith. The same year Armenia became the first country to adopt Christianity as its [[state religion]].<ref>It was the first nation to adopt Christianity as its official religion. The Journal of Ecclesiastical History \u2013 Page 268 by Cambridge University Press, Gale Group, C.W. Dugmore</ref> The newly built cathedral, the Mother Church in [[Vagharshapat, Armenia|Etchmiadzin]] became and remains the spiritual and cultural center of Armenian Christianity and center of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. Most Armenians were baptized in the [[Murat River|Aratsani]] (upper Euphrates) and [[Aras River|Yeraskh]] (Arax) rivers. Two princes from Ujjain, [[India]] had founded a large kingdom in Armenia in 165 BCE and they established 22 cities covering most of modern Armenia including two Hindu temples dedicated to Gisane and Demetr. According to the account of [[Zenob Glak]] <ref>Patmutiun Tarono, i.e., the \u201cHistory of Taron\", http://www.jassa.org/?p=5282</ref>, one of the first disciples of Gregory the Illuminator, the temples were destroyed and the priests killed along with 1038 defenders of the raid that was ordered by Gregory. \n\nMany of the pre-Christian (traditional Indo-European) festivals and celebrations such as Tyarndarach (Trndez, associated with fire worship) and [[Vartavar]] (Vadarvar, associated with water worship), that dated back thousands of years, were preserved and continued in the form of Christian celebrations and chants. In 302, Gregory received consecration as [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Patriarch of Armenia]] from [[Leontius of Caesarea]],<ref name=Fortescue>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07023a.htm Fortescue, Adrian. \"Gregory the Illuminator.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 13 Aug. 2014]</ref> his childhood friend.\n\n==Retirement and death==\nIn 318, Gregory appointed his second son Aristaces as the next [[Catholicos]]<ref name=Fortescue/> in line of [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenia's Holy Apostolic Church]] to stabilize and continue strengthening Christianity not only in Armenia, but also in the Caucasus. Gregory also placed and instructed his grandson Gregory (one of the sons of Vrtanes) in charge of the holy missions to the peoples and tribes of all of the Caucasus and [[Caucasian Albania]]; the younger man was [[martyr]]ed by a fanatical mob while preaching in Albania.\n\nIn his later years, Gregory withdrew to a small sanctuary near Mount Sebuh (Mt. Sepuh) in the [[Daranali]] province (Manyats Ayr, Upper Armenia) with a small convent of monks, where he remained until his death.\n\n==Veneration==\nAfter his death his corpse was removed to the village of Thodanum (T'ordan, modern Do\u011fank\u00f6y, near [[Erzincan]]). His remains were scattered near and far in the reign of the [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]. His head is believed to be now in [[Armenia]], his left hand at Echmiadzin, and his right at [[Cilicia|the Holy See of Cilicia]] in [[Antelias]], [[Lebanon]]. In the 8th century, the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclast]] decrees in [[Greece]] caused a number of religious orders to flee the [[Byzantine Empire]] and seek refuge elsewhere. [[San Gregorio Armeno]] in [[Naples]] was built in that century over the remains of a Roman temple dedicated to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], by a group of nuns escaping from the Byzantine Empire with the relics of Gregory.<ref name=Fortescue/>\n\nA number of prayers, and about thirty of the canonical hymns of the Armenian Church, are ascribed to Gregory the Illuminator. Homilies of his appeared for the first time in a work called ''Haschacnapadum'' at [[Constantinople]] in 1737; a century afterwards a Greek translation was published at [[Venice]] by the Mekhiterists; and they have since been edited in German by J M Schmid (Ratisbon, 1872). The original authorities for Gregory's life are [[Agathangelos]], whose ''History of Tiridates'' was published by the Mekhitarists in 1835; [[Moses of Chorene]], ''Historiae Armenicae''; and [[Symeon the Metaphrast]].\n\nA ''Life of Gregory'' by the Vartabed Matthew was published in the Armenian language at Venice in 1749 and was translated into English by [[Solomon Caesar Malan|the Rev. Father Malan]] (1868). Gregory is commemorated on September 30 by the [[Orthodox Church]], which styles him \"Holy Hieromartyr Gregory, Bishop of Greater Armenia, Equal of the Apostles and Enlightener of Armenia.\" He is honored with a [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on March 23.\n\n==Gallery==\n[[File:Gregory the Illuminator Statue in Vatican City (2010).jpg|thumb|St. Gregory the Illuminator statue in Vatican City]]\n<gallery>\nFile:Etchmiadzin detail1.jpg|[[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]]\nImage:Stgregoryilluminator.jpg\nImage:Istanbul - Chiesa Pammacaristos (Fetiye camii) - San Gregorio armeniaco - Foto G.

It was ranked as the number 11 hardcover fiction best seller of 1981 by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.<ref name=\"20th Best\">{{cite web|url=http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/courses/entc312/s05/best80.cgi|title=20th-Century American Bestsellers|work=[[The Bowker Annual]]/[[Publishers Weekly]]|publisher=LIS.Illinois.edu|accessdate=January 5, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719211204/http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/courses/entc312/s05/best80.cgi|archivedate=July 19, 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Leto II Atreides]], the God Emperor, has ruled the universe as a tyrant for 3,500 years after becoming a hybrid of human and giant [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]] in ''[[Children of Dune]]''. The death of all other sandworms, and his control of the remaining supply of the all-important drug [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]], has allowed him to keep civilization under his complete command. Leto has been physically transformed into a worm, retaining only his human face and arms, and though he is now seemingly immortal and invulnerable to harm, he is prone to instinct-driven bouts of violence when provoked to anger. As a result, his rule is one of religious awe and [[Despotism|despotic]] fear. Leto has disbanded the [[Landsraad]] to all but a few Great Houses; the remaining powers defer to his authority, although they individually conspire against him in secret. The [[Fremen]] have long since lost their identity and military power, and have been replaced as the Imperial army by the [[Fish Speakers]], an all-female army  who obey Leto without question. He has rendered the human population into a state of trans-galactic stagnation; space travel is non-existent to most people in his Empire, which he has deliberately kept to near-[[medieval]] level of technological sophistication. All of this he has done in accordance with a prophecy divined through precognition that will establish an enforced peace preventing humanity from destroying itself through aggressive behavior.\n\nThe [[desert planet]] [[Arrakis]] has been [[Terraforming|terraform]]ed into a lush forested biosphere, except for a single section of desert retained by Leto for his Citadel. A string of [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola]]s have served Leto over the millennia, and Leto has also fostered the bloodline of his twin sister [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]]. Her descendant Moneo is Leto's [[majordomo]] and closest confidante, while Moneo's daughter Siona has become the leader of an Arrakis-based rebellion against Leto. She steals a set of secret records from his archives, not realizing that he has allowed it. Leto intends to breed Siona with the latest Duncan ghola, but is aware that the ghola, moved by his own morality, may try to assassinate him before this can occur. The [[Ixian]]s send a new ambassador named Hwi Noree to serve Leto, and though he realizes that she has been specifically designed and trained to ensnare him, he cannot resist falling in love with her. She agrees to marry him. Leto tests Siona by taking her out to the middle of the desert. After improperly using her [[stillsuit]] to preserve moisture, dehydration forces her to accept Leto's offer of spice essence from his body to replenish her. Awakened to Leto's prophecy, known as the [[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]],  the experience convinces Siona of the importance of the Golden Path. She remains dedicated to Leto's destruction, and an errant rainstorm demonstrates for her his mortal vulnerability to water.\n\nSiona and Idaho overcome a searing mutual hatred of each other to plan an assassination. As Leto's wedding procession to Tuono Village moves across a high bridge over a river, Siona orders one of her Fish Speakers to destroy the support beams with a [[lasgun]]. The bridge collapses and Leto's entourage, including Hwi, plunge to their deaths into the river below. Leto's body rends apart in the water; the [[sandtrout]] which are part of his body encyst the water and scurry off, while the worm portion burns and disintegrates on the shore. A dying Leto reveals his secret breeding program among the Atreides to produce a human who is invisible to prescient vision. Siona is the finished result, and she and her descendants will retain this ability. He explains that humanity is now free to scatter throughout the universe, never again to face complete destruction. After revealing the location of his secret spice hoard, Leto dies, leaving Duncan and Siona to face the task of managing the empire.\n\n==Concept and themes==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2011}}\nIn ''God Emperor of Dune'', Frank Herbert analyzes the cyclical patterns of human society, as well as humanity's evolutionary drives. Using his ancestral memories, Leto II has knowledge of the entirety of human history and is able to recall the effects  and patterns of tyrannical institutions, from the Babylonian Empire through the Jesuits on ancient Earth, and thus builds an empire existing as a complete nexus encompassing all these methods. This galactic empire differs from the historical tyrants in that it is deliberately designed to end in destruction, and is only instituted in the first place as part of a plan to rescue humanity from an absolute destruction which Leto II has foreseen through his oracular visions. Leto II personally explores the emergent effects of civilization, noting that most hierarchical structures are remnants of evolutionary urges toward safety. Thus, by forming a perfectly safe and stable empire, Leto II delivers a message to be felt throughout history.\n\n==Style==\nStylistically, the novel is permeated by quotations from, and speeches by its main character, Leto, to a degree unseen in any of the other ''Dune'' novels. In part, this stylistic shift is an artifact of how Herbert wrote it: the first draft was written almost entirely in the [[Grammatical person|first-person]] narrative voice, only being revised in later drafts to insert more third-person narration of events.<ref>\"''God Emperor of Dune'' is unique in the series, however, because almost all of the quotations are from ''The Stolen Journals'' (and not from the complete journals found at Dar-es-Balat). They were written by Leto to personalize himself to distant readers in the future....Written in the first person (the early drafts of ''God Emperor'' show that Herbert wrote most of the novel in the first person and left notes for himself to transcribe into the third person; material that he did not transcribe resulted in the journal quotations), they range informally and thought-provokingly over a broad range of subjects from government to prophecy to the nature of language...I believe this is their primary function, for Leto so dominates the book that the other characters seem to exist at times only to bring out differences in him. Even in their most private thoughts they are all obsessed with the God Emperor.\" pg 87, Touponce 1988</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation|\nsurname=Touponce|\ngiven=William F.|\nauthor-link=|\nyear=1988|\ntitle=Frank Herbert|\nplace=Boston, Massachusetts|\npublisher=Twayne Publishers imprint, G.

The site also links into [[transatlantic telephone cable|undersea cable lines]].\n\n==History==\nIts first dish, Antenna One (dubbed \"Arthur\"), was built in 1962 to link with [[Telstar]]. It was the first open [[Parabolic antenna|parabolic design]] and is 25.9 metres (85 feet) in diameter and weighs 1,118 [[tonne]]s. After [[Pleumeur-Bodou Ground Station]] ([[Brittany]]) which received the first live transatlantic television broadcasts from the United States via the Telstar satellite at 0H47 GMT on 11 July 1962, Arthur received his first video in the middle of the same day. It is now a Grade II [[listed structure]] and is therefore protected.\n\nThe site has also played a key role in communications events such as the [[Muhammad Ali]] fights, the [[Olympic Games]], the [[Apollo 11]] Moon landing, and 1985's [[Live Aid]] concert.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-31823167|title=Goonhilly in Cornwall takes off on space missions|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=11 March 2015|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\nThe site's largest dish, dubbed \"Merlin\", has a diameter of 32 metres (105 feet). Other dishes include Guinevere, Tristan, and Isolde after characters in [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legend, much of which takes place in Cornwall.\n\nThe earth station is powered by the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]].

There were also tours around the main BT site and into the heart of Arthur.\n\nAt its prime, the site attracted around 80,000 visitors a year, but in March 2010 BT announced that the visitor centre would be \"Closed for Easter and beyond, until further notice.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/8562305.stm|title=Goonhilly satellite station visitor centre closes|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=11 March 2010|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Future==\nOn 11 January 2011 it was announced that part of the site was to be sold to create a space science centre.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-12159878|title=Goonhilly at 'forefront of space exploration'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|place=[[Cornwall]]|date=11 January 2011|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref> This would involve upgrading some of the dishes to make them suitable for \"deep space communication with spacecraft missions\".

Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in 1921. Although Green Bay is by far the smallest major league professional sports market in North America, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked the Packers as the [[Forbes' list of the most valuable sports teams|world's 26th most valuable sports franchise]] in 2016, with a value of $2.35 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/07/12/full-list-the-worlds-50-most-valuable-sports-teams-2017/#201e40664a05|title=Full List: The World's 50 Most Valuable Sports Teams 2017|last=Badenhausen|first=Kurt|work=Forbes|access-date=July 31, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-[[Super Bowl]] [[List of NFL champions|NFL titles]] and four [[List of Super Bowl champions|Super Bowl victories]].

An [[One-platoon system|iron man]], Hutson played both ways, leading the league in interceptions as a [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] in 1940.

Few suspected the hiring represented the beginning of a remarkable, immediate turnaround. Under Lombardi, the Packers would become ''the'' team of the 1960s, winning five World Championships over a seven-year span, including victories in the first two [[Super Bowl]]s. During the Lombardi era, the stars of the Packers' offense included [[Bart Starr]], [[Jim Taylor (American football)|Jim Taylor]], [[Carroll Dale]], [[Paul Hornung]] (as halfback and placekicker), [[Forrest Gregg]], and [[Jerry Kramer]].

After winning their first three, the Packers lost the next five before finishing strong by sweeping their final four. The 7\u20135 [[1959 Green Bay Packers season|record]] represented the Packers' first winning season since 1947, enough to earn rookie head coach Lombardi the [[NFL Coach of the Year Award|NFL Coach of the Year]].\n\n====1960====\nThe next year, the [[1960 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]], led by [[Paul Hornung]]'s 176 points, won the NFL West title and played in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1960|NFL Championship]] against the [[1960 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] at [[Franklin Field|Philadelphia]].

This consistent level of success would lead to Lombardi's Packers becoming one of the most prominent teams of their era, and to being featured as the face of the NFL on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on December 21, 1962, as part of the magazine's cover story on \"The Sport of the '60s\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19621221,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Cover: Vince Lombardi \u2013 Coaches \u2013 Wisconsin|publisher=Time.com |date=December 21, 1962 |accessdate=August 15, 2014}}</ref> Shortly after Time's article, the Packers faced the [[1962 New York Giants season|Giants]] in a much more brutal [[NFL Championship Game, 1962|championship game]] than the previous year, but the Packers prevailed on the kicking of [[Jerry Kramer]] and the determined running of Jim Taylor.

That game would be remembered for [[Don Chandler]]'s controversial tying field goal in which the ball allegedly went wide right, but the officials signaled \"good.\"  The 13\u201310 overtime win earned the Packers a trip to the NFL Championship game, where Hornung and Taylor ran through the defending champion [[1965 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]], helping the Packers win, 23\u201312, to earn their third NFL Championship under Lombardi and ninth overall.

Lombardi remained as general manager for one season but left in 1969 to become head coach and minority owner of the [[Washington Redskins]].\n\nAfter Lombardi died unexpectedly on September 3, 1970, the NFL renamed the Super Bowl trophy the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] in recognition of his accomplishments with the Packers. The city of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] renamed Highland Avenue in his honor in 1968, placing [[Lambeau Field]] at 1265 Lombardi Avenue ever since.\n\n===1968\u20131991: Post-Lombardi===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 16 - Eddie Lee Ivery.jpg|thumb|right|The Packers, pictured against Cardinals in the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|1982\u201383 playoffs]], only qualified for the postseason twice during the team's post-Lombardi \"dark ages\" (1969\u201391).]]\nFor about a quarter-century after Lombardi's departure, the Packers had relatively little on-field success.

Each led the Packers to a worse record than his predecessor. Poor personnel decisions were rife, notoriously the 1974 trade by acting general manager Dan Devine which sent five 1975 or 1976 draft picks (two first-rounders, two second-rounders and a third) to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] for aging quarterback [[John Hadl]], who would spend only 1\u00bd seasons in Green Bay.<ref>[http://www2.jsonline.com:80/packer/insider/history/oldschool/ Old School Packers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218153613/http://www2.jsonline.com/packer/insider/history/oldschool/ |date=February 18, 2006 }} from the [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] website.

He had his #4 jersey retired by the Packers in 2015.]]\nThe Packers' performance in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s led to a shakeup, with [[Ron Wolf]] hired as general manager and given full control of the team's football operations to start the 1991 season. In 1992, Wolf hired [[San Francisco 49ers]] offensive coordinator [[Mike Holmgren]] as the Packers' new head coach.\n\nSoon afterward, Wolf acquired quarterback [[Brett Favre]] from the [[Atlanta Falcons]] for a first-round pick. Favre got the Packers their first win of the 1992 season, stepping in for injured quarterback [[Don Majkowski]] and leading a comeback over the [[1992 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]]. He started the following week, a win against the [[1992 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], and never missed another start for Green Bay through the end of the 2007 season. He would go on to break the [[Most consecutive starts by a quarterback (NFL)|record]] for consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback, starting 297 consecutive games including stints with the [[New York Jets]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]] with the [[Most consecutive starts (NFL)|streak]] finally coming to an end [[Brett Favre#Consecutive starts streak|late in the 2010 season]].\n\nThe [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] had a 9\u20137 record in [[1992 NFL season|1992]], and began to turn heads around the league when they signed perhaps the most prized free agent in NFL history in [[Reggie White]] on the defense in 1993. White believed that Wolf, Holmgren, and Favre had the team heading in the right direction with a \"total commitment to winning.\" With White on board the Packers made it to the second round of the playoffs during both the [[1993 NFL season|1993]] and [[1994 NFL season|1994]] seasons but lost their 2nd-round matches to their playoff rival, the Dallas Cowboys, playing in Dallas on both occasions. In [[1995 NFL season|1995]], the [[1995 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] won the NFC Central Division championship for the first time since 1972. After a home playoff 37\u201320 win against Favre's former team, the Atlanta Falcons, the Packers defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[1995 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 27\u201317 in San Francisco on the road to advance to the [[NFC Championship Game]], where they lost again to the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 38\u201327.\n\n====1996: Super Bowl XXXI champions====\n[[File:19981213 28 Reggie White, Lambeau Field.jpg|thumb|Reggie White in 1998. White is widely considered one of the greatest defensive players in NFL history, and had his number retired by the Packers in 2005]]\nIn [[1996 NFL season|1996]], the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]]' turnaround was complete. The team posted a league-best 13\u20133 record in the regular season, dominating the competition and securing home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. They were ranked no. 1 in offense with [[Brett Favre]] leading the way, no. 1 in defense with Reggie White as the leader of the defense and no. 1 in special teams with former [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Desmond Howard]] returning punts and kickoffs for touchdowns. After relatively easy wins against the [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] in a muddy 35\u201314 beatdown and [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] 30\u201313, the Packers advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in 29 years. In [[Super Bowl XXXI]], Green Bay defeated the [[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] 35\u201321 to win their 12th world championship. [[Desmond Howard]] was named MVP of the game for his kickoff return for a touchdown that ended the Patriots' bid for a comeback. Then-Packers president [[Bob Harlan]] credited Wolf, Holmgren, Favre, and White for ultimately changing the fortunes of the organization and turning the Green Bay Packers into a model NFL franchise. A 2007 panel of football experts at [[ESPN]] ranked the 1996 Packers the 6th-greatest team ever to play in the Super Bowl.\n\n====1997: defeat in Super Bowl XXXII====\nThe following season the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] recorded another 13\u20133 record and won their second consecutive NFC championship. After defeating the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20137 and [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 23\u201310 in the playoffs, the Packers returned to the Super Bowl as an 11\u00bd point favorite. The team ended up losing in an upset to [[John Elway]] and the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXII]], by the score of 31\u201324.\n\n====1998: Holmgren's last season====\n[[File:19981213 24 Mike Holmgren, Lambeau Field,.jpg|thumb|Holmgren, one of three Packer coaches to win a Super Bowl, pictured in 1998]]\nIn [[1998 NFL season|1998]], the [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] went 11\u20135 and met the [[1998 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in the first-round of the NFC playoffs. It was the fourth consecutive year these teams had met in the playoffs and the sixth overall contest since the 1995 season. The Packers had won all previous games, and the media speculated that another 49ers loss would result in the dismissal of San Francisco head coach [[Steve Mariucci]]. Unlike the previous playoff matches, this game was hotly contested, with the teams frequently exchanging leads. With 4:19 left in the 4th quarter, Brett Favre and the Packers embarked on an 89-yard drive, which concluded with a Favre touchdown pass to receiver [[Antonio Freeman]]. This play appeared to give Green Bay the victory. But San Francisco quarterback [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] led the 49ers on an improbable touchdown drive, which culminated when [[Terrell Owens]] caught Young's pass between several defenders to give the 49ers a lead with three seconds remaining. Afterwards, the game was mired in controversy. Many argued that during the 49ers game-winning drive, Niners receiver [[Jerry Rice]] fumbled the ball but officials stated he was down by contact. Television replays confirmed the fumble, but referees were unable to review the play; the next season the NFL reinstituted an instant replay system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs98/news/1999/990103/01025866.html|title=ESPN.com: Instant replay comes back to haunt Holmgren|website=static.espn.go.com|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref> In the end, this game turned out to be the end of an era in Green Bay. Days later Mike Holmgren left the Packers to become vice president, general manager and head coach of the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Much of Holmgren's coaching staff went with him, and [[Reggie White]] also retired after the season (but later played one season for the [[Carolina Panthers]] in 2000).\n\n====1999: Ray Rhodes' one-year tenure====\nIn 1999, the team struggled to find an identity after the departure of so many of the individuals responsible for their Super Bowl run. [[Ray Rhodes]] was hired in 1999 as the team's new head coach. Rhodes had served around the league as a highly regarded defensive coordinator and more recently experienced moderate success as head coach of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] from 1995 to 1998. Ron Wolf believed that Rhodes' experience and player-friendly demeanor would fit nicely in Green Bay's veteran locker room, but Rhodes was fired after one 8\u20138 [[1999 Green Bay Packers season|season]]. Wolf visited team practice late in the 1999 season and believed that players had become too comfortable with Rhodes' style, and said the atmosphere resembled a country club.\n\n=====2000\u201305: Mike Sherman as head coach=====\n[[File:MikeSherman2003.jpg|thumb|left|Coach Mike Sherman, pictured in 2003]]\nIn 2000, Wolf replaced Rhodes with [[Mike Sherman]]. Sherman had never been a head coach at any level of football and was relatively unknown in NFL circles. He had only coached in professional football for three years starting as the Packers' tight ends coach in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle and became the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, although Sherman did not call the plays during games. Despite Sherman's apparent anonymity, Wolf was blown away in the interview process by the coach's organizational skills and attention to detail. Sherman's inaugural season started slowly, but the Packers won their final four games to achieve a 9\u20137 record. Brett Favre praised the atmosphere Sherman had cultivated in Green Bay's locker room and fans were optimistic about the team's future. In the offseason, however, Wolf suddenly announced his own resignation as general manager to take effect after the April 2001 draft. Packers' president Bob Harlan was surprised by Wolf's decision and felt unsure of how to replace him. Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both general manager and head coach.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004, Sherman coached the Packers to respectable regular-season success, led by the spectacular play of Brett Favre, [[Ahman Green]], and a formidable offensive line. But Sherman's teams faltered in the playoffs. Prior to 2003, the Packers had never lost a home playoff game since the NFL instituted a post-season in 1933 (they were 13\u20130, with 11 of the wins at Lambeau and two more in Milwaukee.). That ended January 4, 2003, when the [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] defeated the [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] 27\u20137 in an NFC Wild Card game. The Packers would also lose at home in the playoffs to the [[2004 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] two years later.\n\nBy the end of the 2004 season, the Packers team depth appeared to be diminishing. Sherman also seemed overworked and reportedly had trouble communicating with players on the practice field with whom he was also negotiating contracts. Harlan felt the dual roles were too much for one man to handle and removed Sherman from the general manager position in early 2005 while retaining him as a head coach. Harlan hired the Seattle Seahawks' vice president of operations [[Ted Thompson]] as the new executive vice president, general manager and director of football operations. The relationship between Thompson and Sherman appeared strained, as Thompson immediately began rebuilding Green Bay's roster. Following a dismal 4\u201312 season, Thompson fired Sherman.\n\n====2006\u201307: McCarthy arrives, Favre departs====\n[[File:Donald Driver - October 24, 2010.jpg|right|thumb|Former Packers wide-receiver [[Donald Driver]]]]\nIn 2006, Thompson hired [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]], the former [[offensive coordinator]] for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[New Orleans Saints]] as his new head coach. McCarthy had also previously served as the [[quarterbacks coach]] for the Packers in 1999.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 2006, Brett Favre announced that he would return for the 2007 season; it would turn out to be one of his best. The Packers won 10 of their first 11 games and finished 13\u20133, earning a first-round bye in the playoffs. The Packers' passing offense, led by Favre and a very skilled wide receiver group, finished second in the NFC, behind the Dallas Cowboys, and third overall in the league. Running back [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]], acquired for a sixth-round draft pick from the New York Giants, became the featured back in Green Bay and rushed for 956 yards and 8 touchdowns in the final 10 games of the regular season. In the divisional playoff round, in a heavy snowstorm, the Packers beat the Seattle Seahawks 42\u201320. Grant rushed for 201 yards and three touchdowns, while Favre tossed an additional three touchdown passes to receiver [[Donald Driver]] (as well as a snowball, which Favre memorably threw at Driver in celebration).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Ben |title=Playful Favre accurate even with snowball |url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/01/13/playful-favre-accurate-even-with-snowball/ |website=East Bay Times |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=January 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Green Bay appeared in their first NFC Championship Game in 10 years facing the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in Green Bay. The game was lost 23\u201320 on an overtime field goal by [[Lawrence Tynes]]. This would be [[Brett Favre]]'s final game as a Green Bay Packer with his final pass being an interception in overtime.\n\n[[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]] coached the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] team during the [[2008 Pro Bowl]] in Hawaii. [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]] and [[Aaron Kampman]] were also picked to play for the NFC Pro Bowl team as starters. [[Donald Driver]] was named as a third-string wideout on the Pro Bowl roster. [[Brett Favre]] was named the first-string quarterback for the NFC, but he declined to play in the Pro Bowl and was replaced on the roster by [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa Bay]] [[quarterback]] [[Jeff Garcia]]. The Packers also had several first alternates, including [[offensive tackle]] [[Chad Clifton]] and [[linebacker]] [[Nick Barnett]].\n\nIn December 2007, [[Ted Thompson]] was signed to a 5-year contract extension with the Packers. In addition, on February 5, 2008, head coach Mike McCarthy signed a 5-year contract extension.\n\n===2008\u2013present: Aaron Rodgers era===\n\n====2008: Transition====\n{{Main|2008 Green Bay Packers season}}\n[[Image:Aaron Rodgers 2008 (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|240px|Quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] in 2008.]]\n\nOn March 4, 2008, [[Brett Favre]] tearfully announced his retirement. Within five months, however, he filed for reinstatement with the NFL on July 29. Favre's petition was granted by Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], effective August 4, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3517219|title=NFL grants Favre reinstatement; sources say QB job is open|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 3, 2008|date=August 3, 2008}}</ref> On August 6, 2008, it was announced that Brett Favre was traded to the [[New York Jets]] for a conditional draft pick in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8381934/Packers-trade-Favre-to-Jets |title=Packers trade Favre to Jets |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |author=Jay Glazer |authorlink=Jay Glazer |date=August 6, 2008 |work=Fox Sports on MSN |quote=The month-long saga has finally come to an end, with the Packers agreeing to trade their future Hall-of-Fame quarterback to the New York Jets, FOXSports.com has learned. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819213402/http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8381934/Packers-trade-Favre-to-Jets |archivedate=August 19, 2008  }}</ref>\n\nThe Packers began their [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]] with their 2005 first-round draft pick, quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]], under center, as the first QB other than Favre to start for the Packers in 16 years. Rodgers played well in his first year starting for the Packers, throwing for over 4,000 yards and 28 touchdowns. However, injuries plagued the Packers' defense, as they lost 7 close games by 4 points or less, finishing with a 6\u201310 record. After the season, eight assistant coaches were dismissed by McCarthy, including Bob Sanders, the team's defensive coordinator, who was replaced by [[Dom Capers]].\n\n====2009: Return to the playoffs====\n{{Main|2009 Green Bay Packers season}}\nIn March 2009, the organization assured fans that Brett Favre's jersey number would be retired, but not during the 2009 season. In April 2009, the Packers selected defensive lineman [[B. J. Raji]] of Boston College as the team's first pick in the draft. The team then traded three draft picks (including the pick the Packers acquired from the Jets for Brett Favre) for another first-round pick, selecting linebacker [[Clay Matthews III]] of the [[University of Southern California]].\n\nDuring the [[2009 NFL season]], two match-ups between the franchise and its former quarterback Brett Favre were highly anticipated after Favre's arrival with the division-rival Vikings in August. The first encounter took place in Week 4, on a [[Monday Night Football]] game which broke several TV audience records. The scheduling of this game was made possible when Baseball Commissioner and Packer Board of Directors member [[Bud Selig]] forced baseball's [[Minnesota Twins]] to play 2 games within a 12-hour span. The Vikings won the game 30\u201323. [[Brett Favre]] threw 3 TDs, no interceptions, and had a passer rating of 135.<ref name=\"nfl.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/gamelogs?id=FAV540222 |title=Brett Favre: Game Logs at |publisher=NFL  |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> The teams met for a second time in Week 8, Favre leading the Vikings to a second win, 38\u201326, in Green Bay. Rodgers was heavily pressured in both games, being sacked 14 times total, but still played well, throwing five touchdowns and only one interception. The next week, the Packers were upset by the win-less [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Following a players-only meeting, the team found some stability on the offensive line with the return of tackle [[Mark Tauscher]] bringing a minor halt to sacks to Rodgers and opening the running game to [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] and the other running backs. Green Bay finished the season strongly, winning 7 out of their last 8 games, including winning their 16th regular season finale in the past 17 seasons, and earning a NFC wild-card playoff bid with an 11\u20135 regular-season record. The Packers defense was ranked No. 2 and the offense was ranked No. 6 with rookies [[Brad Jones (American football)|Brad Jones]] and [[Clay Matthews III]] becoming sensations at linebacker and young players like [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]], [[Brandon Jackson (American football)|Brandon Jackson]], [[Jermichael Finley]] and [[Jordy Nelson]] becoming threats on offense. Rodgers also became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 4,000 yards in each of his first two seasons as a starter. Also, cornerback [[Charles Woodson]] won [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] honors after recording 9 interceptions, forcing four fumbles, 3 touchdowns and registering 74 tackles and 2 sacks. In fact, Woodson's 9 interceptions were more than the 8 collected by all Packer opponents that season. Though the defense was ranked high, injuries to [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]], [[Tramon Williams]], [[Will Blackmon]], [[Atari Bigby]] and [[Brandon Underwood]] severely limited the depth of the secondary and teams like the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] used that to their advantage by unleashing aerial assaults against inexperienced players with the NFL's best receivers. The season ended with an overtime loss in a [[2010 NFL Playoffs#Wild Card playoffs|wild card round]] shootout at the [[Arizona Cardinals]], 51\u201345.\n\n====2010: Super Bowl XLV championship====\n{{Main|2010 Green Bay Packers season}}\n[[File:Mike McCarthy (TJG).JPG|thumb|Current Packers head coach [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]]]]\n\nThe team lost [[Johnny Jolly]] to a season-long suspension after he violated the NFL drug policy.

An early newspaper article referred to the fledglings as \"the Indians\", but by the time they played their first game \"Packers\" had taken hold.\n\nIndian Packing was purchased in 1920 by the Acme Packing Company.

As a result, the early Packers were often referred to as the \"Bays\" or the \"Blues\" (and even occasionally as \"the Big Bay Blues\").\n\nBy 1950, Green Bay had changed its colors to hunter green and gold. Navy blue was kept as a secondary color, seen primarily on sideline capes, but was quietly dropped on all official materials shortly thereafter. The team's current uniform combination of forest green or white jerseys and metallic gold pants was adopted soon after Vince Lombardi arrived in 1959. However, to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary in 1994, the Packers joined in a league-wide donning of \"throwback\" jerseys, back to navy blue and gold. The team would go throwback again for two Thanksgiving Day games against the [[Detroit Lions]], in blue and gold 1930s-era uniforms in 2001, and 1960s green and gold (only slightly different from the current ones) in 2003.<ref>[http://www.packers.com/history/fast_facts/uniform_history/ Packers Uniform History, 1921\u20132004] from Packers.com.

[[NFL blackout]] restrictions for the team apply within both areas. However, Packers games have not been blacked out locally since [[1972 NFL season|1972]] (the last year home game local telecasts were prohibited regardless of sellout status) due to strong home attendance and popularity. As mentioned above, every Packers home game\u2014preseason, regular season and playoffs\u2014has been sold out since 1960.\n\n===Radio===\nThe [[flagship station]] of the [[Packers Radio Network]] is [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps Radio]]'s [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] in Milwaukee, which was the former flagship of the [[Journal Media Group|Journal Broadcast Group]] before its merger with Scripps in April 2015. WTMJ has aired Packers games since 1929, the longest association between a radio station and an NFL team to date, and the only rights deal in American professional sports where a station outside of the team's main metro area is the radio flagship. While this might be unusual, the station can be heard at city-grade strength at all hours in Green Bay proper. Games air in Green Bay on [[WTAQ]] (1360/97.5) and [[WIXX-FM]] (101.1), and [[WAPL]] (105.7) and [[WHBY]] (1150) in [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]] and the [[Fox Cities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.packers.com/gameday/packers_radio_network/station_listing/ |title=Packers Radio Station Listing |publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> [[Wayne Larrivee]] is the play-by-play announcer and [[Larry McCarren]] is the color analyst. Larrivee joined the team after many years as the Chicago Bears' announcer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.packers.com/media-center/radio-shows/packers-radio-network.html |title=Packers Radio Network |publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> [[Jim Irwin (sportscaster)|Jim Irwin]] and [[Max McGee]] were the longtime radio announcers before Larrivee and McCarren. When victory is assured for the Packers, either a game-winning touchdown, interception or a crucial 4th down defensive stop, Larrivee's trademark declaration of \"And there is your dagger!\" signifies the event. In limited circumstances where the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] are in either playoff or post-season contention and their play-by-play takes priority, WTMJ's sister FM station [[WKTI]] (94.5) currently airs Packer games to avert game conflicts.\n\n===Television===\nThe TV rights for pre-season games, not nationally broadcast are held by Scripps television stations [[WGBA-TV]] (Channel 26) in Green Bay and [[WTMJ-TV]] (Channel 4) in Milwaukee,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/141227143.html|title=Packers and Journal Broadcast Group announce partnership deal|last=Wolfley|first=Bob|date=March 2, 2012|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref> along with [[Quincy Media]]'s six [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] stations in the central, northern and western parts of the state, [[KQDS-TV]] (Channel 21) in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]-[[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]], and in [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]]/[[Marquette, Michigan]], [[WLUC-TV]] (Channel 6), along with their [[WLUC-DT2|Fox subchannel]]. As such, these stations are authorized to use the tagline ''Your official Packers station'' in their market area by the team, and also carry two weeknight programs; ''Packers Live'' on Tuesday evening, and the weekly coach's show, ''The Mike McCarthy Show'' on Wednesday evenings at 6:30&nbsp;pm throughout the football season. Until the end of the 2011 season, the team's partner in Green Bay was [[WFRV-TV]] (Channel 5), and sister satellite [[WJMN-TV]] in Escanaba. As part of the 2012 deal, McCarren resigned his duties as [[sports director]] of WFRV to move to WTMJ/WGBA as a Packers analyst, becoming WGBA's official sports director on April 1, 2013, as his [[non-compete clause]] to appear as a sports anchor in Green Bay expired, though he retired as sports director in March 2015 to focus full-time on his duties for the Packer radio and television networks. WFRV/WJMN still airs any Packers regular season home games against an AFC team.\n\nThe 2012 TV rights deal expanded the team's preseason network further across the Midwest. Additional stations include the [[Quad Cities]] region of Iowa/Illinois where game coverage is carried by [[KLJB]] (Channel 18) in [[Davenport, Iowa]] and [[KGCW]] (Channel 26) in [[Burlington, Iowa]], both owned by [[Grant Broadcasting System II]], [[KCWI-TV]] (Channel 23) in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[KWWL (TV)|KWWL]] (Channel 7) in [[Waterloo, Iowa]], and in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[KMTV-TV]] (Channel 3), a sister Scripps station to WTMJ and WGBA. As part of a large package of preseason football from various team networks, [[KFVE]] (Channel 9) in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] also carried Packers state network games in the 2016 preseason. The network also added its first affiliate with [[Spanish language]] play-by-play, Milwaukee's [[WYTU-LD]] (Channel 63/49.4), a [[Telemundo]] affiliate, which airs statewide on [[Charter Communications|Spectrum]] systems. The Spanish broadcast is also simulcast by Scripps' [[WACY-TV]] (Channel 32) in the Green Bay/Appleton market (WACY is an otherwise English-language [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate).\n\nPre-season coverage is produced by [[CBS Sports|CBS]], formerly using the ''[[NFL on CBS]]'' graphics package until the last contract ended as a remnant of WFRV's former ownership by the CBS Corporation itself until 2007. In 2012, the pre-season coverage began to use the [[NBC Sports]] ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' graphics package due to WTMJ/WGBA's NBC affiliation. The TV play-by-play announcer, [[Kevin Harlan]] (also on loan from CBS), is the son of former Packers president [[Bob Harlan]], with [[Rich Gannon]] joining him as color commentator. Since the 2008 pre-season all Packers preseason games on the statewide network are produced and aired in [[high definition television|high definition]], with WTMJ-TV subcontracting the games to minor network affiliates in Milwaukee during [[Summer Olympics]] years due to mandatory non-preemption policies by their network, [[NBC]] (this was not done in 2012 as the pre-season opener was a national ESPN game). In Green Bay, WACY carries preseason games in English if WGBA is unable to during Olympics years.\n\n[[ESPN]] ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games, both pre-season and season, are broadcast over the air on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WLUK-TV]] in Green Bay and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WISN-TV]] (Channel 12) in Milwaukee (ABC affiliate [[WBAY-TV]] in Green Bay carried those games from 2006 until 2015;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fox11online.com/sports/packers-and-nfl/fox-11-to-air-hall-of-fame-game-packers-mnf-games|title=FOX 11 to air Hall of Fame Game, Packers MNF games|date=July 6, 2016|publisher=WLUK-TV|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> the 2016 season was first where that station has not carried a Packer game in its history), while the stations airing Packers games in the [[NFL Network]] ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' package have varied over the years depending on arrangements for syndication or co-network productions and simulcasts with CBS or NBC. WBAY's evening [[news anchor]] Bill Jartz also serves as the [[public address]] system announcer for Lambeau Field.\n\nThe team's intra-squad Lambeau scrimmage at the beginning of the season, marketed as ''Packers Family Night'', was broadcast for over a decade by [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] (Channel 6) in Milwaukee, and produced by WLUK-TV in Green Bay, both Fox affiliates which broadcast the bulk of the team's regular-season games, along with the state's other Fox affiliates until the 2016 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.packers.com/media-center/tv-shows.html |title=Green Bay Packers TV Broadcast Partners |publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> In 2017, Scripps and the Packers Television Network began to originate the Packers Family Night broadcast.\n\n==In popular culture==\nOn ''[[That '70s Show]]'', in season 7 episode 14, [[Donna Pinciotti]] gave away the gang including [[Red Forman]], a long-time Packer fan, and six free tickets to Lambeau Field for a game against the Chicago Bears.

It was introduced into the [[Wehrmacht]] as an entirely new concept in [[Automatic firearm|automatic]] firepower, dubbed the ''Einheitsmaschinengewehr'', meaning \"universal machine gun\" in [[German language|German]].<ref>Jane's Guns Recognition Guide.

Located in [[Kashubia]] in [[Pomerelia|Eastern Pomerania]], Gdynia is part of a [[conurbation]] with the spa town of [[Sopot]], the city of [[Gda\u0144sk]] and [[suburb]]an communities, which together form a [[metropolitan area]] called the [[Tricity, Poland|Tricity]] (''Tr\u00f3jmiasto''), with a population of over a million people.\n\nFor centuries, Gdynia remained a small farming and fishing village on the Baltic coast. At the beginning of the 20th-century Gdynia became a seaside [[resort town]] and experienced an inflow of tourists. This triggered an increase in local population. After Poland regained its independence in 1918, a decision was made to construct a Polish seaport in Gdynia, between the [[Free City of Danzig]] (a semi-autonomous city-state under joint [[League of Nations]] and Polish administration) and German [[Pomerania]], making Gdynia the primary economic hub of the [[Polish Corridor]]. It was then that the town was given a more cosmopolitan character with [[Modernist architecture|modernism]] being the dominant architectural style and emerged as a city in 1926.\n\nThe rapid development of Gdynia was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The [[Wehrmacht|German troops]] refrained from deliberate bombing. The newly built port and shipyard were completely destroyed during the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gdyniaturystyczna.pl/en/informacje-o-miescie/historia-gdyni,5/|title=Gdynia turystyczna|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2016}}</ref> The population of the city suffered much heavier losses as most of the inhabitants were evicted and expelled. The locals were either displaced to other regions of [[occupied Poland]] or sent to Nazi concentration camps throughout Europe. After the war, Gdynia was settled with the former inhabitants of [[Warsaw]] and lost cities such as [[Lviv]] and [[Vilnius]] in the [[Eastern Borderlands]]. The city was gradually regenerating itself with its shipyard being rebuilt and expanded. In December 1970 the shipyard workers protest against the increase of prices was bloodily repressed. This greatly contributed to the rise of the [[Solidarno\u015b\u0107|Solidarity movement]] in [[Gda\u0144sk]].\n\nToday the port of Gdynia is a regular stopover on the itinerary of luxurious passenger ships and a new ferry terminal with a civil airport are under realisation. The city won numerous awards in relation to safety, [[infrastructure]], quality of life and a rich variety of tourist attractions. In 2013 Gdynia was ranked as Poland's best city to live in and topped the rankings in the overarching category of general quality of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/153746,Gdynia-rated-Polands-best-city|title=Gdynia rated Poland's best city|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2016}}</ref> Gdynia is also highly noted for its access to education. There are prestigious universities such as the [[Polish Naval Academy]] nearby.\n\nGdynia hosts the [[Gdynia Film Festival]], the main Polish film festival, and was the venue for the [[International Random Film Festival]] in 2014.\n\n== History ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Muzeum Miasta Gdyni 01.jpg|thumb|City Museum in Gdynia]]\nThe area of the later city of Gdynia shared its history with [[Pomerelia]] (Eastern Pomerania); in prehistoric times it was the center of [[Oksywie culture]]; it was later populated by [[Slavs]] with some [[Baltic Prussian]] influences.\n* Late 10th century: Pomerelia was united with Poland.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Vauchez, Richard Barrie Dobson, Adrian Walford, Michael Lapidge, ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'', Routledge 2000, p.: 1163, {{ISBN|978-1-57958-282-1}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=om4olQhrE84C&pg=PA1164&dq=Gdansk+medieval+Pomerania&lr=&as_brr=3&hl=pl link]</ref>\n* During the reign of [[Mieszko II]] Pomerelia seceded from Poland and became independent.\n* 1116/1121: [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth|Boles\u0142aw III]] reunited Pomerelia with Poland.<ref>James Minahan, One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, p.375, {{ISBN|978-0-313-30984-7}}</ref>\n* 1209: First mention of Oxh\u00f6ft (now known as [[Oksywie]], which is now a part of Gdynia).\n* 1227: [[Pomerelia]] again became an independent Duchy.\n* 1253: First known mention of the name \"Gdynia\", as a [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranian]] ([[Kashubians|Kashubian]]) fishing village.

The first [[Kashubians|Kashubian]] mayor of Gdingen was [[Jan Radtke]].

Lynne Rienner Publishers. 1999. p. 173.</ref> The authorities and seaport workers of the [[Free City of Danzig]] felt Poland's economic rights in the city were being misappropriated to help fight the war. German dockworkers went on strike, refusing to unload shipments of military supplies sent from the West to aid the Polish army,<ref name=\"Citino\"/> and Poland realized the need for a port city it was in complete control of, economically and politically.\n\nConstruction of Gdynia seaport started in 1921<ref name=\"Citino\"/> but, because of financial difficulties, it was conducted slowly and with interruptions. It was accelerated after the [[Sejm]] (Polish parliament) passed the ''Gdynia Seaport Construction Act'' on 23 September 1922. By 1923 a 550-metre pier, {{convert|175|m|abbr=off}} of a wooden tide breaker, and a small harbour had been constructed. Ceremonial inauguration of Gdynia as a temporary military port and fishers' shelter took place on 23 April 1923. The first major seagoing ship arrived on 13 August 1923.\n\n[[File:Gdynia stefan zeromski house.JPG|thumb|right|House of [[Stefan \u017beromski]] in Or\u0142owo]]\n\nTo speed up the construction works, the Polish government in November 1924 signed a contract with the French-Polish Consortium for Gdynia Seaport Construction. By the end of 1925, they had built a small seven-metre-deep harbour, the south pier, part of the north pier, a railway, and had ordered the trans-shipment equipment. The works were going more slowly than expected, however. They accelerated only after May 1926, because of an increase in Polish exports by sea, economic prosperity, the outbreak of the German\u2013Polish trade war which reverted most Polish international trade to sea routes, and thanks to the personal engagement of [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]], Polish Minister of Industry and Trade (also responsible for construction of [[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy]]). By the end of 1930 docks, piers, breakwaters, and many auxiliary and industrial installations were constructed (such as depots, trans-shipment equipment, and a rice processing factory) or started (such as a large cold store).\n\nTrans-shipments rose from 10,000 tons (1924) to 2,923,000 tons (1929). At this time Gdynia was the only transit and special seaport designed for coal exports.\n\nIn the years 1931\u20131939 Gdynia harbour was further extended to become a universal seaport. In 1938 Gdynia was the largest and most modern seaport on the Baltic Sea, as well as the tenth biggest in Europe. The trans-shipments rose to 8.7 million tons, which was 46% of Polish foreign trade. In 1938 the Gdynia shipyard started to build its first full-sea ship, the ''[[SS Olza|Olza]]''.\n\n=== Construction of the city ===\nThe city was constructed later than the seaport. In 1925 a special committee was inaugurated to build the city; city expansion plans were designed and [[city rights]] were granted in 1926, and tax privileges were granted for investors in 1927. The city started to grow significantly after 1928.\n\nA new railway station and the Post Office were completed. The State railways extended their lines, built bridges and also constructed a group of houses for their employees. Within a few years houses were built along some {{convert|10|mi|0|abbr=out}} of road leading northward from the Free City of Danzig to Gdynia and beyond. Public institutions and private employers helped their staffs to build houses.<br/>\nIn 1933 a plan of development providing for a population of 250,000 was worked out by a special commission appointed by a government committee, in collaboration with the municipal authorities. By 1939 the population had grown to over 120,000.<ref>(ed) Michael Murray, ''Poland's Progress 1919\u20131939'', John Murray, 1944, London pp 64\u20136</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=135>\nFile:Plac Kaszubski, Gdynia1.jpg|''Plac Kaszubski'' - one of the main squares in the city\nFile:S\u0105d rejonowy betonowe 06.jpg|Main regional courthouse dating back to 1936\nFile:Gdynia Aleja J\u00f3zefa Pi\u0142sudskiego (2).JPG|Pi\u0142sudski Avenue with modernist buildings\nFile:Gdynia z lotu ptaka - 081.JPG|The Port of Gdynia, initially constructed in the 1920s\nFile:Gdynia Dowodztwo MW 2.jpg|Headquarters of the Polish Navy\n</gallery>\n\n=== Gdynia during World War II (1939\u20131945) ===\n[[File:Blyskawica l d.jpg|thumb|[[ORP B\u0142yskawica|ORP ''B\u0142yskawica'']]]]\n[[File:Dworzec Gdynia G\u0142\u00f3wna z pl. Konst.

Some 50,000 Polish citizens, who after 1920 had been brought into the area by the Polish government after the decision to enlarge the harbour was made, were expelled to the [[General Government]]. [[Kashubians]] who were suspected to support the Polish cause, particularly those with higher education, were arrested and executed. The main place of execution was Pia\u015bnica (Gro\u00df Pla\u00dfnitz), where about 12,000 were executed. The German [[gauleiter]] [[Albert Forster]] considered Kashubians of \"low value\" and did not support any attempts to create a Kashubian nationality. Some Kashubians organized anti-Nazi resistance groups, \"Gryf Kaszubski\" (later \"Gryf Pomorski\"), and the exiled \"Zwiazek Pomorski\" in Great Britain.\n\nThe harbour was transformed into a German naval base. The [[shipyard]] was expanded in 1940 and became a branch of the [[Kiel]] shipyard (''Deutsche Werke Kiel A.G.''). Gotenhafen became an important base, due to its being relatively distant from the [[war theater]], and many German large ships\u2014[[battleship]]s and [[heavy cruiser]]s\u2014were anchored there. During 1942, Dr Joseph Goebbels authorized relocation of {{SS|Cap Arcona|1927|2}} to Gotenhafen Harbour as a stand-in for {{RMS|Titanic}} during filming of the German-produced movie ''[[Titanic (1943 film)|Titanic]]'', directed by [[Herbert Selpin]].\n\nThe city was also the location for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] ''Gotenhafen'', a subcamp of the [[Stutthof concentration camp]] near Gda\u0144sk.\n\nThe seaport and the shipyard both witnessed several air raids by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] from 1943 onwards, but suffered little damage. Gotenhafen was used during winter 1944\u201345 to evacuate German [[troop]]s and refugees trapped by the [[Red Army]]. Some of the ships were hit by [[torpedo]]es from Soviet [[submarine]]s in the [[Baltic Sea]] on the route west. The ship {{MV|Wilhelm Gustloff||2}} sank, taking about 9,400 people with her \u2013 the worst loss of life in a single sinking in maritime history. The seaport area was largely destroyed by withdrawing German troops and millions of encircled [[refugee]]s in 1945 being bombarded by the Soviet military (90% of the buildings and equipment were destroyed) and the harbour entrance was blocked by the German battleship {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} that had been brought to Gotenhafen for major repairs.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nOn March 28, 1945, Gotenhafen was captured by the Soviets and assigned to Polish [[Gda\u0144sk Voivodeship]], who again renamed it Gdynia.<ref name=\"World Port Source - Gdynia\"/>\n\nIn the [[Polish 1970 protests]], worker demonstrations took place at Gdynia Shipyard. Workers were fired upon by the police. The fallen (e.g. [[Brunon Drywa]]) became symbolized by a fictitious worker [[Janek Wi\u015bniewski]], commemorated in a song by [[Mieczys\u0142aw Cholewa]], ''Pie\u015b\u0144 o Janku z Gdyni''.\nOne of Gdynia's important streets is named after [[Janek Wi\u015bniewski]].

Gdynia occupies the space traditionally held by [[Mediterranean Avenue]], being the lowest voted city to make it onto the Monopoly Here and Now board, but also the smallest city to make it in the game. All of the other cities are large and widely known ones, the second smallest being Riga. The unexpected success of Gdynia can be attributed to a mobilization of the town's population to vote for it on the Internet.\n\nAn abandoned factory district in Gdynia was the scene for the survival series ''Man vs Wild'', season 6, episode 12.

Gluons are actually just bosons, since they are the equilibrium force between the two quarks, which together form a triumvirate, and thus the energy force of the boson is in the form of a gluon, and thus the quarks become stable.  They cannot separate unless something greater is capable of separating the quarks from each other, and so the gluon appears to hold these forces together.  In fact it is just a type of energy while the two smaller forces, the quarks (also forms of energy) can unite under a single force, and this is the gluon's job.  The gluon essentially acts as an equilibrium or center of balance between these two quarks, which are likely of opposite forces. It is usually the particle with the greatest energy and the least imbalanced of the three quarks.  Since quarks can be either fermionic or bosonic, or symmetric and asymmetric, then quarks or particles of this stature that have zero spin are able to form gluons, which are capable of leading quarks into a new state. These higher states are the names for baryons, such as protons and neutrons, or whatever else it may be that acts as this mediating force, since it is assumed that the scale of the gluon and the quark could be the same, unless that gluon were made of quarks, which it is not.  Thus gluons are quarks that are bosons, implying they are symmetric quarks.  \n\nIn technical terms, gluons are [[Vector boson|vector]] [[gauge boson]]s that mediate [[strong interaction]]s of [[quark]]s in [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). Gluons themselves carry the [[color charge]] of the strong interaction. This is unlike the [[photon]], which mediates the [[Electromagnetic force|electromagnetic interaction]] but lacks an electric charge. Gluons therefore participate in the strong interaction in addition to mediating it, making QCD significantly harder to analyze than QED ([[quantum electrodynamics]]).\n\n==Properties==\nThe gluon is a [[vector boson]]; like the [[photon]], it has a [[spin (physics)|spin]] of 1. While massive spin-1 particles have three polarization states, massless gauge bosons like the gluon have only two polarization states because [[gauge invariance]] requires the polarization to be [[transverse wave|transverse]]. In [[quantum field theory]], unbroken gauge invariance requires that gauge bosons have zero mass (experiments limit the gluon's rest mass to less than a few meV/c<sup>2</sup>). The gluon has negative intrinsic [[parity (physics)|parity]].\n\n==Counting gluons==\nUnlike the single [[photon]] of QED or the three [[W and Z bosons]] of the [[weak interaction]], there are eight independent types of gluon in QCD.\n\nThis may be difficult to understand intuitively. [[Quark]]s carry three types of [[color charge]]; antiquarks carry three types of anticolor. Gluons may be thought of as carrying both color and anticolor. This gives nine ''possible'' combinations of color and anticolor in gluons. The following is a list of those combinations (and their schematic names):\n\n* red-antired (<math>r\\bar{r}</math>), red-antigreen (<math>r\\bar{g}</math>), red-antiblue (<math>r\\bar{b}</math>)\n* green-antired (<math>g\\bar{r}</math>), green-antigreen (<math>g\\bar{g}</math>), green-antiblue (<math>g\\bar{b}</math>)\n* blue-antired, (<math>b\\bar{r}</math>), blue-antigreen (<math>b\\bar{g}</math>), blue-antiblue (<math>b\\bar{b}</math>)\n\n[[File:Feynman Diagram Y-3g.svg|thumb|240px|right|Diagram 2: e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>\u2212</sup> &rarr; \u03a5(9.46) &rarr; 3g]]\nThese are not the ''actual''  color states of observed gluons, but rather ''effective'' states. To correctly understand how they are combined, it is necessary to consider the mathematics of color charge in more detail.\n\n===Color charge and superposition===\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], the states of particles may be added according to the [[quantum superposition|principle of superposition]]; that is, they may be in a \"combined state\" with a ''probability'', if some particular quantity is measured, of giving several different outcomes. A relevant illustration in the case at hand would be a gluon with a color state described by:\n\n:<math>(r\\bar{b}+b\\bar{r})/\\sqrt{2}.</math>\n\nThis is read as \"red\u2013antiblue plus blue\u2013antired\". (The factor of the square root of two is required for [[normalisable wave function|normalization]], a detail that is not crucial to understand in this discussion.) If one were somehow able to make a direct measurement of the color of a gluon in this state, there would be a 50% chance of it having red-antiblue color charge and a 50% chance of blue-antired color charge.\n\n===Color singlet states===\nIt is often said that the stable strongly interacting particles (such as the proton and the neutron, i.e. [[hadrons]]) observed in nature are \"colorless\", but more precisely they are in a \"color singlet\" state, which is mathematically analogous to a [[singlet state|''spin'' singlet state]].<ref name=\"Griff\">\n{{cite book\n |author=David Griffiths\n |year=1987\n |title=Introduction to Elementary Particles\n |pages=280\u2013281\n |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]\n |isbn=978-0-471-60386-3\n}}</ref> Such states allow interaction with other color singlets, but not with other color states; because long-range gluon interactions do not exist, this illustrates that gluons in the singlet state do not exist either.<ref name=\"Griff\"/>\n\nThe color singlet state is:<ref name=\"Griff\"/>\n\n:<math>(r\\bar{r}+b\\bar{b}+g\\bar{g})/\\sqrt{3}.</math>\n\nIn words, if one could measure the color of the state, there would be equal probabilities of it being red-antired, blue-antiblue, or green-antigreen.\n\n===Eight gluon colors===\n<!-- the link \"eight gluon types\" from the article \"Quark\" links here -->\nThere are eight remaining independent color states, which correspond to the \"eight types\" or \"eight colors\" of gluons. Because states can be mixed together as discussed above, there are many ways of presenting these states, which are known as the \"color octet\". One commonly used list is:<ref name=\"Griff\"/>\n\n{| style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n|<math>(r\\bar{b}+b\\bar{r})/\\sqrt{2}</math>\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|<math>-i(r\\bar{b}-b\\bar{r})/\\sqrt{2}</math>\n|-\n|<math>(r\\bar{g}+g\\bar{r})/\\sqrt{2}</math>\n|\n|<math>-i(r\\bar{g}-g\\bar{r})/\\sqrt{2}</math>\n|-\n|<math>(b\\bar{g}+g\\bar{b})/\\sqrt{2}</math>\n|\n|<math>-i(b\\bar{g}-g\\bar{b})/\\sqrt{2}</math>\n|-\n|<math>(r\\bar{r}-b\\bar{b})/\\sqrt{2}</math>\n|\n|<math>(r\\bar{r}+b\\bar{b}-2g\\bar{g})/\\sqrt{6}.</math>\n|}\n\nThese are equivalent to the [[Gell-Mann matrices]]. The critical feature of these particular eight states is that they are [[linearly independent]], and also independent of the singlet state, hence 3<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 or 2<sup>3</sup>. There is no way to add any combination of these states to produce any other, and it is also impossible to add them to make r{{overline|r}}, g{{overline|g}}, or b{{overline|b}}<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=J. Baez\n |title=Why are there eight gluons and not nine?\n |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/gluons.html\n |accessdate=2009-09-13\n |archiveurl=\n |archivedate=\n}}</ref> the forbidden [[singlet state]]. There are many other possible choices, but all are mathematically equivalent, at least equally complicated, and give the same physical results.\n\n===Group theory details===\nTechnically, QCD is a [[gauge theory]] with [[SU(3)]] gauge symmetry. Quarks are introduced as [[spinor]]s in ''N''<sub>f</sub> [[flavour (particle physics)|flavor]]s, each in the [[fundamental representation]] (triplet, denoted '''3''') of the color gauge group, SU(3). The gluons are vectors in the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]] (octets, denoted '''8''') of color SU(3). For a general [[lie group|gauge group]], the number of force-carriers (like photons or gluons) is always equal to the dimension of the adjoint representation. For the simple case of SU(''N''), the dimension of this representation is {{nowrap|''N''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1}}.\n\nIn terms of group theory, the assertion that there are no color singlet gluons is simply the statement that [[quantum chromodynamics]] has an SU(3) rather than a [[U(N)|U(3)]] symmetry. There is no known [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] reason for one group to be preferred over the other, but as discussed above, the experimental evidence supports SU(3).<ref name=\"Griff\"/> The U(1) group for electromagnetic field combines with a slightly more complicated group known as SU(2) \u2013 S stands for \"special\" \u2013 which means the corresponding matrices have determinant 1 in addition to being unitary.\n\n==Confinement==\n{{main|Color confinement}}\nSince gluons themselves carry color charge, they participate in strong interactions. These gluon-gluon interactions constrain color fields to string-like objects called \"[[QCD string|flux tube]]s\", which exert constant force when stretched. Due to this force, [[quark]]s are [[color confinement|confined]] within [[composite particle]]s called [[hadron]]s. This effectively limits the range of the strong interaction to {{val|1|e=-15}} meters, roughly the size of an [[atomic nucleus]]. Beyond a certain distance, the energy of the flux tube binding two quarks increases linearly. At a large enough distance, it becomes energetically more favorable to pull a quark-antiquark pair out of the vacuum rather than increase the length of the flux tube.\n\nGluons also share this property of being confined within hadrons. One consequence is that gluons are not directly involved in the [[nuclear force]]s between hadrons. The force mediators for these are other hadrons called [[meson]]s.\n\nAlthough in the [[normal phase of QCD]] single gluons may not travel freely, it is predicted that there exist hadrons that are formed entirely of gluons \u2014 called [[glueball]]s. There are also conjectures about other [[exotic hadron]]s in which real gluons (as opposed to [[virtual particle|virtual]] ones found in ordinary hadrons) would be primary constituents. Beyond the normal phase of QCD (at extreme temperatures and pressures), [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] forms. In such a plasma there are no hadrons; quarks and gluons become free particles.\n\n==Experimental observations==\n[[Quark]]s and gluons (colored) manifest themselves by fragmenting into more quarks and gluons, which in turn hadronize into normal (colorless) particles, correlated in jets. As shown in 1978 summer conferences,<ref name=\"SMY\"/> the [[PLUTO detector]] at the electron-positron collider DORIS ([[DESY]]) produced the first evidence that the hadronic decays of the very narrow resonance \u03a5(9.46) could be interpreted as [[three-jet event]] topologies produced by three gluons.

Jacob's name is changed to Israel, and through the agency of his son [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], the [[children of Israel]] descend into Egypt, 70 people in all with their households, and God promises them a future of greatness. Genesis ends with Israel in Egypt, ready for the coming of [[Moses]] and [[the Exodus]]. The narrative is punctuated by a series of [[Covenant (biblical)|covenants with God]], successively narrowing in scope from all mankind (the [[Noahic Covenant|covenant with Noah]]) to a special relationship with one people alone (Abraham and his descendants through Isaac and Jacob).<ref name=\"Bandstra28-29\"/>\n\nIn [[Judaism]], the theological importance of Genesis centers on the covenants linking [[God in Judaism|God]] to his [[Jews as the chosen people|chosen people]] and the people to the [[Promised Land]].

God creates the first [[humans]] [[Adam and Eve]] and all the animals in the [[Garden of Eden]] but instructs them not to eat the fruit of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge of good and evil]]. A talking [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]]  portrayed as a deceptive creature or [[trickster]], entices Eve into eating it anyway, and she entices Adam, whereupon God throws them out and curses them\u2014Adam to getting what he needs only by sweat and work, and Eve to giving birth in pain. This is interpreted by Christians as [[fall of man|the fall]] of humanity. Eve bears two sons, [[Cain and Abel]]. Cain kills Abel after God accepts Abel's offering but not Cain's. God then [[Curse and mark of Cain|curses Cain]]. Eve bears another son, [[Seth]], to take Abel's place.\n\nAfter many [[generations of Adam]] have passed from the lines of Cain and Seth, the world becomes corrupted by human [[sin]] and [[Nephilim]], and God determines to wipe out humanity. First, he instructs the righteous [[Noah]] and his family to build an [[Noah's ark|ark]] and put examples of all the animals on it, seven pairs of every clean animal and one pair of every unclean. Then God sends a [[Genesis flood narrative|great flood]] to wipe out the rest of the world. When the waters recede, God promises that he will not destroy the world a second time with water with the [[Rainbows in mythology|rainbow as a symbol of his promise]]. God sees mankind cooperating to build a great tower city, the [[Tower of Babel]], and divides humanity with many languages and sets them apart with confusion.\n\nGod instructs Abram to travel from his home in [[Mesopotamia]] to the land of [[Canaan]]. There, God makes a covenant with Abram, promising that his descendants shall be as numerous as the stars, but that people will suffer oppression in a foreign land for four hundred years, after which they will inherit the land \"from the [[Brook of Egypt|river of Egypt]] to the great river, the river [[Euphrates]]\". Abram's name is changed to Abraham and that of his wife Sarai to [[Sarah]], and [[circumcision]] of all males is instituted as the sign of the covenant. Because Sarah is old, she tells Abraham to take her Egyptian handmaiden, [[Hagar]], as a second wife. Through Hagar, Abraham fathers [[Ishmael]].\n\nGod resolves to destroy the cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] for the sins of their people. Abraham protests and gets God to agree not to destroy the cities if 10 righteous men can be found. Angels save Abraham's nephew [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] and his family, but [[Lot's wife|his wife]] looks back on the destruction against their command and is turned into a pillar of salt. Lot's daughters, concerned that they are fugitives who will never find husbands, get him drunk to become pregnant by him, and give birth to the ancestors of the [[Moab]]ites and [[Ammon]]ites.\n\nAbraham and Sarah go to the Philistine town of [[Gerar]], pretending to be brother and sister (they are half-siblings). The King of Gerar takes Sarah for his wife, but God warns him to return her, and he obeys. God sends Sarah a son to be named [[Isaac]], through whom the covenant will be established. At Sarah's insistence, Ishmael and his mother Hagar are driven out into the wilderness, but God saves them and promises to make Ishmael a great nation.\n\nGod tests Abraham by demanding that he [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice Isaac]]. As Abraham is about to lay the knife upon his son, God restrains him, promising him numberless descendants. On the death of Sarah, Abraham purchases [[Cave of the Patriarchs|Machpelah]] (believed to be modern [[Hebron]]) for a family tomb and sends his servant to Mesopotamia to find among his relations a wife for Isaac, and Rebekah is chosen. Other children are born to Abraham by another wife, [[Keturah]], among whose descendants are the [[Midian]]ites, and he dies in a prosperous old age and is buried in his tomb at Hebron.\n\nIsaac's wife [[Rebecca]] gives birth to the twins [[Esau]], father of the [[Edom]]ites, and [[Jacob]]. Through deception, Jacob becomes the heir instead of Esau and gains his father's blessing. He flees to [[Laban (Bible)|his uncle]] where he prospers and earns his two wives, [[Rachel]] and [[Leah]]. Jacob's name is changed to Israel, and by his wives and their handmaidens he has twelve sons, the ancestors of the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel, and a daughter, [[Dinah]].\n\n[[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], Jacob's favorite son, is sold into slavery in [[Egypt]] by his jealous brothers. But Joseph prospers, after hardship, with God's guidance of [[Dream interpretation|interpreting Pharaoh's dream]] of upcoming famine. He is then reunited with his father and brothers, who fail to recognize him, and plead for food. After much manipulation, he reveals himself and lets them and their households into Egypt, where [[Pharaoh]] assigns to them the [[land of Goshen]]. Jacob calls his sons to his bedside and [[Blessing of Jacob|reveals their future]] before he dies. Joseph lives to an old age and exhorts his brethren, if God should lead them out of the country, to take his bones with them.\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:Moln\u00e1r \u00c1brah\u00e1m kik\u00f6lt\u00f6z\u00e9se 1850.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Abram's Journey from [[Ur Ka\u015bdim|Ur]] to [[Canaan]] ([[J\u00f3zsef Moln\u00e1r (painter)|J\u00f3zsef Moln\u00e1r]], 1850)]]\n\n=== Title and textual witnesses ===\nGenesis takes its Hebrew title from the first word of the first sentence, ''Bereshit'', meaning \"In the beginning [of]\"; in the Greek [[Septuagint]] it was called ''Genesis'', from the phrase \"the generations of heaven and earth\".{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=491}} There are four major textual witnesses to the book: the [[Masoretic Text]], the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], the [[Septuagint]], and fragments of Genesis found at [[Qumran]]. The Qumran group provides the oldest manuscripts but covers only a small proportion of the book; in general, the Masoretic Text is well preserved and reliable, but there are many individual instances where the other versions preserve a superior reading.<ref>Hendel, R. S. (1992). \"Genesis, Book of\". In D. N. Freedman (Ed.), ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary'' (Vol. 2, p. 933). New York: Doubleday</ref>\n\n=== Origins ===\n{{Main|Documentary hypothesis}}\nFor much of the 20th century most scholars agreed that the five books of the [[Pentateuch]]\u2014Genesis, [[book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]]\u2014came from four sources, the [[Yahwist]], the [[Elohist]], the [[Deuteronomist]] and the [[Priestly source]], each telling the same basic story, and joined together by various editors.<ref>Gooder (2000), pp. 12\u201314</ref> Since the 1970s there has been a revolution in scholarship: the Elohist source is now widely regarded as no more than a variation on the Yahwist, while the Priestly source is increasingly seen not as a document but as a body of revisions and expansions to the Yahwist (or \"non-Priestly\") material. (The Deuteronomistic source does not appear in Genesis).<ref>Van Seters (2004), pp. 30\u201386</ref>\n\nExamples of repeated and duplicate stories are used to identify the separate sources.  In Genesis these include three different accounts of a Patriarch claiming that his wife was his sister, the two creation stories, and the two versions of Abraham sending Hagar and Ishmael into the desert.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Lawrence Boadt|author2=Richard J. Clifford |author3=Daniel J. Harrington |date= 2012 |title=Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction |url= |location= |publisher=Paulist Press|page= |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nThis leaves the question of when these works were created. Scholars in the first half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that the Yahwist was produced in the monarchic period, specifically at the court of [[Solomon]], 10th century BC, and the Priestly work in the middle of the 5th century BC (the author was even identified as [[Ezra]]), but more recent thinking is that the Yahwist was written either just before or during the [[Babylonian exile]] of the 6th century BC, and the Priestly final edition was made late in the Exilic period or soon after.<ref name=\"Davies37\"/>\n\nAs for why the book was created, a theory which has gained considerable interest, although still controversial is \"Persian imperial authorisation\". This proposes that the Persians of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], after their conquest of Babylon in 539&nbsp;BC, agreed to grant Jerusalem a large measure of local autonomy within the empire, but required the local authorities to produce a single law code accepted by the entire community. The two powerful groups making up the community\u2014the priestly families who controlled the Temple and who [[Myth of origins|traced their origin]] to Moses and the wilderness wanderings, and the major landowning families who made up the \"elders\" and who traced their own origins to Abraham, who had \"given\" them the land\u2014were in conflict over many issues, and each had its own \"history of origins\", but the Persian promise of greatly increased local autonomy for all provided a powerful incentive to cooperate in producing a single text.<ref>Ska (2006), pp. 169, 217\u201318</ref>\n\n=== Genre ===\nGenesis is perhaps best seen as an example of a [[creation myth]], a type of literature telling of the first appearance of humans, the stories of ancestors and heroes, and the origins of culture, cities and so forth.<ref>Van Seters (2004) pp. 113\u201314</ref> The most notable examples are found in the work of Greek historians of the 6th century BC: their intention was to connect notable families of their own day to a distant and heroic past, and in doing so they did not distinguish between [[myth]], [[legend]], and facts.<ref>Whybray (2001), p. 39</ref> Professor Jean-Louis Ska of the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] calls the basic rule of the antiquarian historian the \"law of conservation\": everything old is valuable, nothing is eliminated.<ref name=\"Ska169\">Ska (2006), p. 169</ref> Ska also points out the purpose behind such antiquarian histories: antiquity is needed to prove the worth of Israel's traditions to the nations (the neighbours of the Jews in early Persian Palestine), and to reconcile and unite the various factions within Israel itself.<ref name=\"Ska169\"/>\n\n== Themes ==\n[[File:Bourgeois Joseph recognized by his brothers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Joseph recognized by his brothers (L\u00e9on Pierre Urban Bourgeois, 1863)]]\n\n=== Promises to the ancestors ===\nIn 1978 [[David Clines]] published his influential ''The Theme of the Pentateuch'' \u2013 influential because he was one of the first to take up the question of the theme of the entire five books. Clines' conclusion was that the overall theme is \"the partial fulfillment \u2013 which implies also the partial nonfulfillment \u2013 of the promise to or blessing of the Patriarchs\". (By calling the fulfillment \"partial\" Clines was drawing attention to the fact that at the end of Deuteronomy the people are still outside Canaan).<ref>Clines (1997), p. 30</ref>\n\nThe [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]], or ancestors, are Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, with their wives (Joseph is normally excluded).<ref name=\"Hamilton50\">Hamilton (1990), p. 50</ref> Since the name YHWH had not been revealed to them, they worshipped El in his various manifestations.<ref>{{Citation|title= A Short Introduction to the Hebrew Bible | author = John J Collins | publisher = Fortress Press | date = 2007 | page = 47}}</ref> (It is, however, worth noting that in the Jahwist source the patriarchs refer to deity by the name YHWH, for example in Genesis 15.) Through the patriarchs God announces the election of Israel, meaning that he has chosen Israel to be his special people and committed himself to their future.<ref>Brueggemann (2002), p. 61</ref> God tells the patriarchs that he will be faithful to their descendants (i.e. to Israel), and Israel is expected to have faith in God and his promise. (\"Faith\" in the context of Genesis and the Hebrew Bible means agreement to the promissory relationship, not a body of belief).<ref>Brueggemann (2002), p. 78</ref>\n\nThe promise itself has three parts: offspring, blessings, and land.<ref>McKeown (2008), p. 4</ref> The fulfilment of the promise to each patriarch depends on having a male heir, and the story is constantly complicated by the fact that each prospective mother \u2013 [[Sarah]], [[Rebekah]] and [[Rachel]] \u2013 is barren. The ancestors, however, retain their faith in God and God in each case gives a son \u2013 in Jacob's case, twelve sons, the foundation of the chosen [[Israelites]]. All three promises are more richly fulfilled in each succeeding generation, until through Joseph \"all the world\" is saved from famine,<ref>Wenham (2003), p. 34</ref> and by bringing the children of Israel down to Egypt he becomes the means through which the promise can be fulfilled.<ref name=\"Hamilton50\"/>\n\n=== God's chosen people ===\nScholars generally agree that the theme of divine promise unites the patriarchal cycles, but many would dispute the efficacy of trying to examine Genesis' theology by pursuing a single overarching theme, instead citing as more productive the analysis of the Abraham cycle, the Jacob cycle, and the Joseph cycle, and the [[Yahwist]] and [[Priestly source]]s.<ref>Hamilton (1990), pp. 38\u201339</ref> The problem lies in finding a way to unite the patriarchal theme of divine promise to the stories of Genesis 1\u201311 (the [[primeval history]]) with their theme of God's forgiveness in the face of man's evil nature.<ref>Hendel, R. S. (1992). \"Genesis, Book of\". In D. N. Freedman (Ed.), ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary'' (Vol. 2, p. 935).

The [[Covenant (biblical)#Noahic covenant|first covenant]] is between God and all living creatures, and is marked by the sign of the rainbow; the second is with the descendants of Abraham ([[Ishmaelites]] and others as well as Israelites), and its sign is [[Brit milah|circumcision]]; and the last, which doesn't appear until the [[book of Exodus]], is with Israel alone, and its sign is [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]. Each covenant is mediated by a great leader ([[Noah]], Abraham, [[Moses]]), and at each stage God progressively reveals himself by his name ([[Elohim]] with Noah, [[El Shaddai]] with Abraham, [[Yahweh]] with Moses).<ref name=\"Bandstra28-29\"/>\n\n== Judaism's weekly Torah portions ==\n{{main|Weekly Torah portion}}\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - f 2v.png|thumb|right|250px|First Day of Creation (from the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'')]]\n:*''[[Bereshit (parsha)|Bereshit]], on Genesis 1\u20136: Creation, Eden, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Lamech, wickedness''\n:*''[[Noach (parsha)|Noach]], on Genesis 6\u201311: Noah's Ark, the Flood, Noah's drunkenness, the Tower of Babel''\n:*''[[Lech-Lecha]], on Genesis 12\u201317: Abraham, Sarah, Lot, covenant, Hagar and Ishmael, circumcision''\n:*''[[Vayeira (parsha)|Vayeira]], on Genesis 18\u201322: Abraham's visitors, Sodomites, Lot's visitors and flight, Hagar expelled, binding of Isaac''\n:*''[[Chayei Sarah (parsha)|Chayei Sarah]], on Genesis 23\u201325: Sarah buried, Rebekah for Isaac''\n:*''[[Toledot (parsha)|Toledot]], on Genesis 25\u201328: Esau and Jacob, Esau's birthright, Isaac's blessing''\n:*''[[Vayetze (parsha)|Vayetze]], on Genesis 28\u201332: Jacob flees, Rachel, Leah, Laban, Jacob's children and departure''\n:*''[[Vayishlach (parsha)|Vayishlach]], on Genesis 32\u201336: Jacob's reunion with Esau, the rape of Dinah''\n:*''[[Vayeshev (parsha)|Vayeshev]], on Genesis 37\u201340: Joseph's dreams, coat, and slavery, Judah with Tamar, Joseph and Potiphar''\n:*''[[Miketz (parsha)|Miketz]], on Genesis 41\u201344: Pharaoh's dream, Joseph's in government, Joseph's brothers visit Egypt\n:*''[[Vayigash (parsha)|Vayigash]], on Genesis 44\u201347: Joseph reveals himself, Jacob moves to Egypt\n:*''[[Vaychi]], on Genesis 47\u201350: Jacob's blessings, death of Jacob and of Joseph\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n* [[Dating the Bible]]\n* [[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]]\n* [[Genesis creation narrative]]\n* [[Genesis 1:1]]\n* [[Historicity of the Bible]]\n* [[Mosaic authorship]]\n* ''[[Paradise Lost]]''\n* [[Protevangelium]]\n* [[Wife\u2013sister narratives in the Book of Genesis]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Commentaries on Genesis ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last=Bandstra\n|first=Barry L.\n|title=Reading the Old Testament\n|publisher=Cengage Learning\n|year=2008\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Barry+Bandstra+2004#v=onepage&q=Barry%20Bandstra%202004&f=false\n|ref=harv\n|isbn=0495391050\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last=Bergant\n|first=Dianne\n|title=Genesis: In the Beginning\n|publisher=Liturgical Press\n|year=2013\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mRCwAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Bergant+Genesis+in+the+beginning#v=onepage&q=Bergant%20Genesis%20in%20the%20beginning&f=false\n|ref=harv\n|isbn=9780814682753\n}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Blenkinsopp|first=Joseph|title=Creation, Un-creation, Re-creation: A Discursive Commentary on Genesis 1\u201311|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B12qwOSMD20C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780567372871}}\n* {{cite book |last=Brueggemann |first=Walter |date=1986 |title=Genesis|series=Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJh1BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Walter+Brueggemann+Genesis#v=onepage&q=Walter%20Brueggemann%20Genesis&f=false |location=Atlanta |publisher=John Knox Press |page= |isbn=0-8042-3101-X |author-link=Walter Brueggemann }}\n* {{Cite book\n|last=Carr\n|first=David M.\n|ref=harv\n|chapter=Genesis, Book of\n|editor1-last=Freedman\n|editor1-first=David Noel\n|editor2-last=Myers\n|editor2-first=Allen C.\n|title=Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible\n|publisher=Amsterdam University Press\n|year=2000\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B12qwOSMD20C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|isbn=9780567372871\n}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Cotter|first=David W|title=Genesis|publisher=[[Liturgical Press]]|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6lCVzr4cT9QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Genesis+David+W.+Cotter#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780814650400}}\n* {{cite book |last=De La Torre |first=Miguel |date=2011 |title=Genesis|series=Belief: A Theological Commentary on the Bible |url= |location= |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |page= |isbn= |author-link=Miguel A.

The study of field extensions and their relationship to the [[polynomial]]s that give rise to them via Galois groups is called [[Galois theory]], so named in honor of [[\u00c9variste Galois]] who first discovered them.\n\nFor a more elementary discussion of Galois groups in terms of [[permutation group]]s, see the article on [[Galois theory]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nSuppose that {{math|''E''}} is an [[field extension|extension]] of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''F''}} (written as {{math|''E''/''F''}} and read \"{{math|''E''}} over {{math|''F''}}\"). An [[automorphism]] of {{math|''E''/''F''}} is defined to be an automorphism of {{math|''E''}} that fixes {{math|''F''}} pointwise. In other words, an automorphism of {{math|''E''/''F''}} is an [[isomorphism]] {{math|''\u03b1''}} from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''}} such that {{math|''\u03b1''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''}} for each {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''F''}}. The set of all automorphisms of {{math|''E''/''F''}} forms a group with the operation of [[function composition]]. This group is sometimes denoted by {{math|[[Automorphism group|Aut]](''E''/''F'')}}.\n\nIf {{math|''E''/''F''}} is a [[Galois extension]], then {{math|Aut(''E''/''F'')}} is called the \"Galois group of (the extension) {{math|''E''}} over {{math|''F''}}, and is usually denoted by {{math|Gal(''E''/''F'')}}.<ref>Some authors refer to {{math|Aut(''E''/''F'')}} as the Galois group for arbitrary extensions {{math|''E''/''F''}} and use the corresponding notation, e.g. {{harvnb|Jacobson|2009}}.</ref>\n\nIf {{math|''E''/''F''}} is not a [[Galois extension]], then the Galois group of (the extension) {{math|''E''}} over {{math|''F''}} is sometimes defined as {{math|[[Automorphism group|Aut]](''G''/''F'')}}, where {{math|''G''}} is the [[Galois closure]] of {{math|''E''}}.\n\n==Examples==\nIn the following examples {{math|''F''}} is a field, and {{math|'''C'''}}, {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|'''Q'''}} are the fields of [[complex number|complex]], [[real number|real]], and [[rational number|rational]] numbers, respectively. The notation {{math|''F''(''a'')}} indicates the [[field extension]] obtained by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element {{math|''a''}} to the field {{math|''F''}}.\n\n* {{math|Gal(''F''/''F'')}} is the trivial group that has a single element, namely the identity automorphism.\n* {{math|Gal('''C'''/'''R''')}} has two elements, the identity automorphism and the [[complex conjugation]] automorphism.<ref>{{citation|title=Classical Algebra: Its Nature, Origins, and Uses|first=Roger L.|last=Cooke|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2008|isbn=9780470277973|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JG-skeT1eWAC&pg=PA138}}.</ref>\n* {{math|Aut('''R'''/'''Q''')}} is trivial. Indeed, it can be shown that any automorphism of {{math|'''R'''}} must preserve the [[order theory|ordering]] of the real numbers and hence must be the identity.\n* {{math|Aut('''C'''/'''Q''')}} is an infinite group.\n* {{math|Gal('''Q'''({{sqrt|2}})/'''Q''')}} has two elements, the identity automorphism and the automorphism which exchanges +{{sqrt|2}} and \u2212{{sqrt|2}}.\n* Consider the field {{math|''K'' {{=}} '''Q'''({{radic|2|3}})}}. The group {{math|Aut(K/'''Q''')}} contains only the identity automorphism. This is because {{math|''K''}} is not a [[normal extension]], since the other two complex cube roots of 2 are missing from the extension\u2014in other words {{math|''K''}} is not a [[splitting field]]. <!-- gee it's annoying saying \"complex\" here... it's an entirely algebraic phenomenon! -->\n* Consider now {{math|''L'' {{=}} '''Q'''({{radic|2|3}}, ''\u03c9'')}}, where {{math|''\u03c9''}} is a [[root of unity|primitive cube root of unity]]. The group {{math|Gal(L/'''Q''')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}}, the [[dihedral group of order 6]], and {{math|''L''}} is in fact the splitting field of {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 2}} over {{math|'''Q'''}}.\n* If {{math|''q''}} is a prime power, and if {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''GF'''(''q'')}} and {{math|''E'' {{=}} '''GF'''(''q''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} denote the [[Finite field|Galois fields]] of order {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}} respectively, then {{math|Gal(''E''/''F'')}} is cyclic of order {{math|''n''}} and generated by the [[Frobenius homomorphism]].\n* If {{math|''f''}} is an [[irreducible polynomial]] of prime degree {{math|''p''}} with rational coefficients and exactly two nonreal roots, then the Galois group of {{math|''f''}} is the full [[symmetric group]] {{math|''S''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\n==Properties==\nThe significance of an extension being Galois is that it obeys the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]]: the closed (with respect to the [[Krull topology]]) subgroups of the Galois group correspond to the intermediate fields of the field extension.\n\nIf {{math|''E''/''F''}} is a Galois extension, then {{math|Gal(''E''/''F'')}} can be given a [[topological space|topology]], called the Krull topology, that makes it into a [[profinite group]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Absolute Galois group]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n| last=Jacobson\n| first=Nathan\n| author-link=Nathan Jacobson\n| title=Basic Algebra I\n| year=2009\n| edition=2nd\n| publisher=Dover Publications\n| isbn=978-0-486-47189-1\n| origyear=1985\n}}\n*{{Lang Algebra}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{springer|title=Galois group|id=p/g043150}}\n*{{MathPages|id=home/kmath290/kmath290|title=Galois Groups}}\n\n[[Category:Galois theory]]", "sha1": "32uwih6t7trgneypxm0dinhrw3f8ywf"}}, {"title": "German Empire", "ns": "0", "id": "12674", "revision": {"id": "866551036", "parentid": "866550782", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T01:16:52Z", "contributor": {"username": "Bumm13", "id": "63286"}, "minor": "", "comment": "formatting fixes", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the German nation-state existing from 1871 to 1918|other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n{{Infobox former country\n|native_name = ''{{lang|de|Deutsches Kaiserreich}}''\n|conventional_long_name = German Empire<!-- Do not replace with 'German Reich';

As these events occurred, the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]]-led [[North German Confederation]] and its southern German allies were still engaged in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].\n\nThe German Empire consisted of 26 states, most of them ruled by noble families. They included four [[Monarchy|kingdoms]], six [[Grand duchy|grand duchies]], five [[Duchy|duchies]] (six before 1876), seven [[Principality|principalities]], three [[Free imperial city|free]] [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] [[City-state|cities]], and one [[Alsace-Lorraine|imperial territory]]. Although [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was one of several kingdoms in the realm, it contained about two thirds of Germany's population and territory. Prussian dominance was also established constitutionally.\n\nAfter 1850, the states of Germany had rapidly become [[industrialisation|industrialized]], with particular strengths in [[coal]], [[iron]] (and later [[steel]]), chemicals, and [[rail transport|railways]]. In 1871, Germany had a population of 41 million people; by 1913, this had increased to 68 million.

Broad reforms and the [[Kulturkampf]] marked his period in the office. Late in Bismarck's chancellorship and in spite of his personal opposition, Germany [[German colonial empire|became involved]] in [[colonialism]]. Claiming much of the leftover territory that was yet unclaimed in the [[Scramble for Africa]], it managed to build the third-largest [[colonial empire]] after the [[British Empire|British]] and the [[Second French colonial empire|French]] ones.<ref>[https://www.welt.de/kultur/article168705897/Diese-deutschen-Woerter-kennt-man-noch-in-der-Suedsee.html Diese deutschen W\u00f6rter kennt man noch in der S\u00fcdsee, von Matthias Heine] \"Einst hatten die Deutschen das drittgr\u00f6\u00dfte Kolonialreich[...]\"</ref> As a [[Colonial empire|colonial state]], it sometimes clashed with other [[Great power|European powers]], especially the [[British Empire]].\n\nGermany became a [[great power]], boasting a rapidly developing rail network, the world's strongest army, and a fast-growing industrial base.<ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1987)</ref> In less than a decade, its [[Imperial German Navy|navy]] became second only to [[Great Britain|Britain's]] [[Royal Navy]]. After the removal of  [[Otto von Bismarck]] by [[Wilhelm II]] in 1890, the Empire embarked on [[Weltpolitik]] \u2013 a bellicose new course that ultimately contributed to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. In addition, Bismarck's successors were incapable of maintaining their predecessor's complex, shifting, and overlapping alliances which had kept Germany from being diplomatically isolated. This [[Wilhelminism|period]] was marked by various factors influencing the Emperor's decisions, which were often perceived as contradictory or unpredictable by the public. In 1879, the German Empire consolidated the [[Dual Alliance (1879)|Dual Alliance]] with [[Austria-Hungary]], followed by the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in 1882. It also retained [[Germany-Turkey relations|strong diplomatic ties]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. When [[July Crisis|the great crisis of 1914]] arrived, Italy left the alliance and the Ottoman Empire [[Ottoman\u2013German alliance|formally allied with Germany]].\n\nIn the First World War, [[Schlieffen Plan|German plans to capture Paris quickly]] in the autumn of 1914 failed.  The war on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] became a stalemate. The [[Blockade of Germany|Allied naval blockade]] caused severe shortages of food. However, Imperial Germany had  success on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]; it occupied a large amount of territory to its east following the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. The German declaration of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] in early 1917, contributed to bringing the United States into the war.\n\nThe [[Oberste Heeresleitung|high command]] under [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]] increasingly controlled the country, but in October after the failed offensive in [[Spring Offensive|spring 1918]], the German armies [[Hundred Days Offensive|were in retreat]] and their allied Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire had collapsed, [[Bulgaria during World War I|Bulgaria]] had surrendered. The Empire collapsed in the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|November 1918 Revolution]] with the abdications of its rulers. This left a postwar [[Weimar Republic|federal republic]] that generated a devastated and unsatisfied populace, which later led to the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany|Nazism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Main article|Unification of Germany}}\n[[File:Bismarck_pickelhaube.jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|[[Otto von Bismarck]], the visionary statesman who unified Germany with the help of his skillful political moves and the exploitation of encountered opportunities]]\nThe [[German Confederation]] had been created by an act of the [[Congress of Vienna]] on 8 June 1815 as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], after being alluded to in [[:wikisource:Treaty of Paris (1814)#ART.VI|Article 6]] of the 1814 [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Manual of the History of the Political System of Europe and its Colonies|last1=Heeren|first1=Arnold Hermann Ludwig|author-link1=Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren|editor-last=Talboys|editor-first=David Alphonso|editor-link=David Alphonso Talboys|year=1873|page=480|publisher=H.

Bismarck sought to extend [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] hegemony throughout the German states; to do so meant unification of the German states and the exclusion of Prussia's main German rival, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], from the subsequent German Empire. He envisioned a conservative, Prussian-dominated Germany. Three wars led to military successes and helped to persuade German people to do this: the [[Second Schleswig War]] against [[Denmark]] in 1864, the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] against [[Second French Empire|France]] in 1870\u201371.\n\nThe [[German Confederation]] ended as a result of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 between the constituent Confederation entities of the [[Austrian Empire]] and its allies on one side and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and its allies on the other. The war resulted in the partial replacement of the Confederation in 1867 by a [[North German Confederation]], comprising the 22 states north of the [[Main (river)|Main]]. The patriotic fervour generated by the [[Franco-Prussian War]] overwhelmed the remaining opposition to a unified Germany (aside from Austria) in the four states south of the Main and during November 1870 they joined the North German Confederation by treaty.<ref>{{cite book|title=European Constitutional History|last=Case|first=Nelson|year=1902|publisher=Jennings & Pye|location=Cincinnati|page=139|oclc=608806061|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2t9AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA139|ref= harv}}</ref>\n\n== Foundation ==\n{{Main article|Founding of the German Empire}}\n\nOn 10 December 1870, the [[North German Confederation]] Reichstag renamed the Confederation the \"German Empire\" and gave the title of [[German Emperor]] to [[William I, German Emperor|William I]], the [[King of Prussia]], as ''Bundespr\u00e4sidium'' of the Confederation.<ref name=\"case139-140\">{{harvnb|Case|1902|pp=139\u2013140}}</ref> The new constitution ([[Constitution of the German Confederation 1871|Constitution of the German Confederation]]) and the title Emperor came into effect on 1 January 1871.

The political system remained the same. The empire had a parliament called the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'', which was elected by [[Universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]]. However, the original constituencies drawn in 1871 were never redrawn to reflect the growth of urban areas. As a result, by the time of the great expansion of German cities in the 1890s and first decade of the 20th century, rural areas were grossly [[Malapportionment|over-represented]].\n\n[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|''Die Proklamation des Deutschen Kaiserreiches'' by [[Anton von Werner]] (1877), depicting the proclamation of ''Kaiser Wilhelm'' (18 January 1871, [[Palace of Versailles]]).

At centre (in white): Otto von Bismarck, first Chancellor of Germany, [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]], Prussian Chief of Staff.]]\n\nLegislation also required the consent of the ''[[Bundesrat (German Empire)|Bundesrat]]'', the federal council of deputies from the 27 states. Executive power was vested in the emperor, or ''Kaiser'', who was assisted by a [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|chancellor]] responsible only to him. The emperor was given extensive powers by the constitution. He alone appointed and dismissed the chancellor (so in practice the emperor ruled the empire through the chancellor), was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and final arbiter of all foreign affairs, and could also disband the ''Reichstag'' to call for new elections. Officially, the chancellor was a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the [[State Secretary|State Secretaries]] (bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers. The ''Reichstag'' had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills and to initiate legislation. However, as mentioned above, in practice the real power was vested in the emperor, who exercised it through his chancellor.\n\nAlthough nominally a federal empire and league of equals, in practice, the empire was dominated by the largest and most powerful state, Prussia. Prussia stretched across the northern two-thirds of the new ''Reich'' and contained three-fifths of its population. The imperial crown was hereditary in the ruling house of Prussia, the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. With the exception of 1872\u20131873 and 1892\u20131894, the chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of Prussia. With 17 out of 58 votes in the ''Bundesrat'', Berlin needed only a few votes from the smaller states to exercise effective control.\n\nThe other states retained their own governments, but had only limited aspects of sovereignty. For example, both postage stamps and currency were issued for the empire as a whole. Coins through one mark were also minted in the name of the empire, while higher-valued pieces were issued by the states. However, these larger gold and silver issues were virtually [[commemorative coins]] and had limited circulation.\n\nWhile the states issued their own [[military decoration|decoration]]s and some had their own armies, the military forces of the smaller ones were put under Prussian control. Those of the larger states, such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony, were coordinated along Prussian principles and would in wartime be controlled by the federal government.\n\nThe evolution of the German Empire is somewhat in line with parallel developments in Italy, which became a united nation-state a decade earlier. Some key elements of the German Empire's authoritarian political structure were also the basis for conservative modernization in [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] under [[Meiji Emperor|Meiji]] and the preservation of an authoritarian political structure under the [[tsar]]s in the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nOne factor in the social anatomy of these governments was the retention of a very substantial share in political power by the [[landed elite]], the [[Junker]]s, resulting from the absence of a revolutionary breakthrough by the peasants in combination with urban areas.\n\nAlthough authoritarian in many respects, the empire had some democratic features. Besides universal suffrage, it permitted the development of political parties. Bismarck's intention was to create a constitutional fa\u00e7ade which would mask the continuation of authoritarian policies. In the process, he created a system with a serious flaw. There was a significant disparity between the Prussian and German electoral systems. Prussia used a highly restrictive [[Prussian three-class franchise|three-class voting system]] in which the richest third of the population could choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring a conservative majority. As mentioned above, the king and (with two exceptions) the prime minister of Prussia were also the emperor and chancellor of the empire \u2013 meaning that the same rulers had to seek majorities from legislatures elected from completely different franchises. Universal suffrage was significantly diluted by gross over-representation of rural areas from the 1890s onward. By the turn of the century, the urban-rural population balance was completely reversed from 1871; more than two-thirds of the empire's people lived in cities and towns.\n\n==Constituent states==\n{{Main article|List of states of the German Empire}}\n{{See also|List of historic states of Germany}}\n[[File:Wappen und Flaggen des Deutschen Reichs und der Preu\u00dfischen Provinzen.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Coat of arms and flags of the constituent states in the year 1900]]\n\nBefore unification, German territory was made up of 27 [[constituent state]]s. These states consisted of kingdoms, grand duchies, duchies, principalities, free [[Hanseaten (class)|Hanseatic]] cities and one imperial territory. The free cities had a [[republic]]an form of government on the state level, even though the Empire at large was constituted as a [[monarchy]], and so were most of the states. The [[Kingdom of Prussia]] was the largest of the constituent states, covering two-third of the empire's territory.\n\nSeveral of these states had gained sovereignty following the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and had been ''de facto'' sovereign from the mid-1600s onward. Others were created as sovereign states after the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. Territories were not necessarily contiguous\u2014many existed in several parts, as a result of historical acquisitions, or, in several cases, divisions of the ruling families. Some of the initially existing states, in particular Hanover, were abolished and annexed by Prussia as a result of the war of 1866.\n\nEach component of the German Empire sent representatives to the Federal Council (''Bundesrat'') and, via single-member districts, the Imperial Diet (''Reichstag''). Relations between the Imperial centre and the Empire's components were somewhat fluid and were developed on an ongoing basis. The extent to which the Emperor could, for example, intervene on occasions of disputed or unclear succession was much debated on occasion\u2014for example in the inheritance crisis of the [[Principality of Lippe|Lippe-Detmold]].\n\n===Map and table===\n{{German Empire States|width=600|include_list=y}}\n\n===Other maps===\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Karte Deutsches Reich, Verwaltungsgliederung 1900-01-01.png|Administrative map\nFile:Karte Deutsches Reich, Gliederung der oberen Verwaltungsebenen 1900-01-01.png|The Empire in 1900\nFile:Meyers b4 s0812a.jpg|Population density (c. 1885)\nFile:German Empire - Prussia (1871).svg|Kingdom of Prussia\nFile:German Empire - Bavaria (1871).svg|Kingdom of Bavaria\nFile:German Empire - Saxony (1871).svg|Kingdom of Saxony\nFile:German Empire - Wurttemberg (1871).svg|Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg\nFile:German colonial.PNG|[[German colonial empire|Colonies]] in 1914\nFile:German Empire - Alsace Lorraine (1871).svg|Imperial territory of Alsace and Lorraine\nFile:Karte der Reichstagswahlkreise farbig-2011-11-09.svg|Election constituencies for the Reichstag\nFile:Karte der Reichstagswahlen 1912 en.png|[[German federal election, 1912|Reichstag election results, 1912]]\nFile:DR Fields of Law.png|Fields of Law in the German Empire\nFile:Deutsche Rechts- und Gerichtskarte (1895).jpg| Different legal systems in Germany prior to 1900\nFile:Meyers b18 s0533a.jpg|Crime; convicts in relation to the population 1882\u20131886\nFile:Verbreitung der Konfessionen im deutschen Reich.jpg|Distribution of Protestants and Catholics in Imperial Germany\nFile:Meyers b4 s0817a.jpg|Distribution of Protestants, Catholics and Jews in Imperial Germany (Meyers Konversationslexikon)\nFile:Verbreitung der Juden im deutschen Reich.jpg|Distribution of Jews in Imperial Germany\nFile:Sprachenkarte Kozenn 1906.jpg|Linguistic map of Central Europe, 1906\nFile:Deutsches Kaiserreich 1893.jpg|Detailed 1893 map with cities and larger towns\nFile:Karte Brigadestandorte des Deutschen Heers 1914.png|German Army positions 1914\n</gallery>\n\n==Language==\n[[File:Sprachen Deutsches Reich 1900.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Percentage of linguistic minorities of the German Empire in 1900 by [[Kreis in Prussia|Kreis]]]]\n\nAbout 92% of the population spoke German as their first language.

Still, there were almost entirely Catholic areas (Lower and Upper Bavaria, northern Westphalia, Upper Silesia, etc.) and almost entirely Protestant areas (Schleswig-Holstein, Pomerania, Saxony, etc.). Confessional prejudices, especially towards mixed marriages, were still common. Bit by bit, through internal migration, religious blending was more and more common. In eastern territories, confession was almost uniquely perceived to be connected to one's ethnicity and the equation \"Protestant = German, Catholic = Polish\" was held to be valid. In areas affected by immigration in the Ruhr area and Westphalia, as well as in some large cities, religious landscape changed substantially. This was especially true in largely Catholic areas of Westphalia, which changed through Protestant immigration from the eastern provinces.\n\nPolitically, the confessional division of Germany had considerable consequences. In Catholic areas, the Centre Party had a big electorate. On the other hand, Social Democrats and [[Free Trade Unions (Germany)|Free Trade Unions]] usually received hardly any votes in the Catholic areas of the Ruhr. This began to change with the secularization arising in the last decades of the German Empire.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+ Religious confessions in the German Empire 1880\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Area\n! colspan=\"2\"|Protestant\n! colspan=\"2\"|Catholic\n! colspan=\"2\"|Other Christian\n! colspan=\"2\"|Jewish\n! colspan=\"2\"|Other\n|-\n!Number\n!%\n!Number\n!%\n!Number\n!%\n!Number\n!%\n!Number\n!%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Prussia||17,633,279 ||64,64||9,206,283||33,75 ||52,225||0,19 ||363,790|| 1,33 ||23,534|| 0,09\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Bavaria ||1,477,952 ||27,97||3,748,253||70,93 ||5,017||0,09 ||53,526|| 1,01 || 30|| 0,00\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Saxony ||2,886,806||97,11 ||74,333||2,50|| 4,809||0,16 || 6,518|| 0,22 ||339|| 0,01\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| W\u00fcrttemberg ||1,364,580 ||69,23||590,290||29,95 || 2,817||0,14 ||13,331|| 0,68 ||100|| 0,01\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Baden ||547,461 ||34,86||993,109||63,25 || 2,280||0,15 ||27,278|| 1,74 ||126|| 0,01\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Alsace-Lotharingia ||305,315 ||19,49||1,218,513||77,78 ||3,053||0,19 ||39,278|| 2,51 ||511|| 0,03\n|- style=\"background: lightcoral\" class=\"sortbottom\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| German Empire ||28,331,152|| 62,63||16,232,651||35,89 ||78,031||0,17 ||561,612|| 1,24 ||30,615|| 0,07\n|}\n\n==Bismarck era==\n{{History of Germany}}\n[[File:Otto von Bismarck.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Otto von Bismarck]]]]\n\nBismarck's domestic policies played an important role in forging the authoritarian political culture of the ''Kaiserreich''. Less preoccupied by continental power politics following unification in 1871, Germany's semi-parliamentary government carried out a relatively smooth economic and political revolution from above that pushed them along the way towards becoming the world's leading industrial power of the time.\n\nBismarck's \"revolutionary conservatism\" was a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans\u2014not just the Junker elite\u2014more loyal to throne and empire. According to Kees van Kersbergen and Barbara Vis, his strategy was:\n\n{{quote|granting social rights to enhance the integration of a hierarchical society, to forge a bond between workers and the state so as to strengthen the latter, to maintain traditional relations of authority between social and status groups, and to provide a countervailing power against the modernist forces of liberalism and socialism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kersbergen|first1=Kees van|last2=Vis|first2=Barbara|title=Comparative Welfare State Politics: Development, Opportunities, and Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQL3AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA38|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=38|isbn=978-1-107-65247-7}}</ref>}}\n\nHe created the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s and enacted universal male suffrage in the new German Empire in 1871.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Robert Laurence|last2=Vaudagna|first2=Maurizio|title=The American Century in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeoqKSxiOu4C&pg=PA226|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=226|isbn=0-8014-4075-0}}</ref> He became a great hero to German conservatives, who erected many monuments to his memory and tried to emulate his policies.<ref>Richard E.

British historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] concludes that he \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [devoting] himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\".<ref>[[Eric Hobsbawm]], ''The Age of Empire: 1875\u20131914'' (1987), p. 312.</ref> This was a departure from his adventurous foreign policy for Prussia, where he favored strength and expansion, punctuating this by saying \"The great question of the age are not settled by speeches and majority votes - this was the error of 1848-49 - but by iron and blood.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title=German Diplomatic Relations 1871-1945: The Wilhelmstrasse And the Formulation Of Foreign Policy|last=Young|first=William|publisher=iUniverse|year=2006|isbn=9780595407064|location=New York|pages=33}}</ref>\n\nBismarck's chief concern was that France would plot revenge after its defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. As the French lacked the strength to defeat Germany by themselves, they sought an alliance with Russia, which would trap Germany between the two in a war (as would ultimately happen in 1914). Bismarck wanted to prevent this at all costs and maintain friendly relations with the Russians, and thereby formed an alliance with them and Austria-Hungary, the ''[[League of the Three Emperors|Dreikaiserbund]]'' (League of Three Emperors) in 1881. The alliance was further cemented by a separate [[non-aggression pact]] with Russia called [[Reinsurance Treaty]], which was signed in 1887.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Russian Foreign Policy: Interests, Vectors, and Sectors|last=Gvosdev|first=Nikolas|last2=Marsh|first2=Christopher|publisher=CQ Press|year=2013|isbn=9781452234847|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=241}}</ref> During this period, individuals within the German military were advocating a preemptive strike against Russia, but Bismarck knew that such ideas were foolhardy. He once wrote that \"the most brilliant victories would not avail against the Russian nation, because of its climate, its desert, and its frugality, and having but one frontier to defend\", and because it would leave Germany with another bitter, resentful neighbour.\n\nMeanwhile, the chancellor remained wary of any foreign policy developments that looked even remotely warlike. In 1886, he moved to stop an attempted sale of horses to France on the grounds that they might be used for cavalry and also ordered an investigation into large Russian purchases of medicine from a German chemical works. Bismarck stubbornly refused to listen to Georg Herbert zu Munster (ambassador to France), who reported back that the French were not seeking a revanchist war, and in fact were desperate for peace at all costs.\n\nBismarck and most of his contemporaries were conservative-minded and focused their foreign policy attention on Germany's neighbouring states. In 1914, 60% of German foreign investment was in Europe, as opposed to just 5% of British investment. Most of the money went to developing nations such as Russia that lacked the capital or technical knowledge to industrialize on their own. The construction of the [[Baghdad Railway]], financed by German banks, was designed to eventually connect Germany with the Turkish Empire and the [[Persian Gulf]], but it also collided with British and Russian geopolitical interests.\n\nMany consider Bismarck's foreign policy as a coherent system and partly responsible for the preservation of Europe's stability.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=A History of Modern Germany Since 1815|last=Tipton|first=Frank|publisher=Continuum|year=2003|isbn=0826449093|location=London|pages=170}}</ref> It was also marked by the need to balance circumspect defensiveness and the desire to be free from the constraints of its position as a major European power.<ref name=\":1\" /> Unfortunately, Bismark's successors did not pursue his foreign policy legacy. For instance, Kaiser Wilhelm II, who dismissed the chancellor in 1890, let the treaty with Russia lapse in favor of Germany's alliance with Austria, which finally led to a stronger coalition-building between Russia and France.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Colonies====\n{{Main article|German colonial empire}}\n[[File:Karolinen-stamp.jpg|thumb|right|A postage stamp from the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]]]]\n\nBismarck secured a number of German colonial possessions during the 1880s in Africa and the Pacific, but he never considered an overseas colonial empire valuable due to fierce resistance to German colonial rule from the natives.

Previously, the United Kingdom held that spot. Germany's main economic rivals were the United Kingdom and the United States. Throughout its existence, it experienced economic growth and modernization led by heavy industry. In 1871, it had a largely rural population of 41 million, while by 1913 this had increased to a predominantly urban population of 68 million.\n\n====Industrial power====\n\nFor 30 years, Germany struggled against Britain to be Europe's leading industrial power. Representative of Germany's industry was the steel giant [[Krupp]], whose first factory was built in [[Essen]]. By 1902, the factory alone became \"A great city with its own streets, its own police force, fire department and traffic laws. There are 150 kilometres of rail, 60 different factory buildings, 8,500 machine tools, seven electrical stations, 140 kilometres of underground cable and 46 overhead.\"<ref>Edmond Taylor, ''The fossil monarchies: the collapse of the old order, 1905\u20131922 (1967) p 206</ref>\n\nUnder Bismarck, Germany was a world innovator in building the [[welfare state]]. German workers enjoyed health, accident and maternity benefits, canteens, changing rooms and a national pension scheme.<ref name=\"P. Hennock, 2007\">E. P. Hennock, ''The Origin of the Welfare State in England and Germany, 1850\u20131914: Social Policies Compared'' (2007)</ref>\n\n====Railways====\nLacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the [[Ruhr]] and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and forged ahead of France.<ref>Allan Mitchell, ''Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815\u20131914'' (2000)</ref> The total length of German railroad tracks expanded from 21,000 kilometers in 1871 to 63,000 kilometres by 1913, establishing the largest rail network in the world after the United States, and effectively surpassing the 32,000 kilometers of rail that connected Britain in the same year.<ref>Edgar Feuchtwanger, ''Imperial Germany, 1850\u20131918'' (2006), Table 1</ref>\n\n====Industry====\n[[File:Essen a54 v Stadtpanorama-1890.jpg|thumb|[[Krupp]] Works in [[Essen]], 1890]]\n\nIndustrialisation progressed dynamically in Germany, and German manufacturers began to capture domestic markets from British imports, and also to compete with British industry abroad, particularly in the U.S. The German textile and metal industries had by 1870 surpassed those of Britain in organisation and technical efficiency and superseded British manufacturers in the domestic market. Germany became the dominant economic power on the continent and was the second largest exporting nation after Britain.\n\nTechnological progress during German industrialisation occurred in four waves: the railway wave (1877\u20131886), the dye wave (1887\u20131896), the chemical wave (1897\u20131902), and the wave of electrical engineering (1903\u20131918).<ref>Jochen Streb, et al. \"Technological and geographical knowledge spillover in the German empire 1877\u20131918\", ''Economic History Review,'' May 2006, Vol. 59 Issue 2, pp. 347\u2013373</ref> Since Germany industrialised later than Britain, it was able to model its factories after those of Britain, thus making more efficient use of its capital and avoiding legacy methods in its leap to the envelope of technology. Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, motors and electricity. Germany's dominance in physics and chemistry was such that one-third of all Nobel Prizes went to German inventors and researchers.\n\nThe German [[cartel]] system (known as ''Konzerne''), being significantly concentrated, was able to make more efficient use of capital. Germany was not weighted down with an expensive worldwide empire that needed defense. Following Germany's annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in 1871, it absorbed parts of what had been France's industrial base.<ref>Stephen Broadberry, and Kevin H. O'Rourke.

In 1913, these eight firms produced almost 90% of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80% of their production abroad. The three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrichemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemicals]]. Top-level decision-making was in the hands of professional salaried managers; leading Chandler to call the German dye companies \"the world's first truly managerial industrial enterprises\".<ref>Chandler (1990) pp. 474\u2013475</ref> There were many spinoffs from research\u2014such as the pharmaceutical industry, which emerged from chemical research.<ref>Carsten Burhop, \"Pharmaceutical Research in Wilhelmine Germany: the Case of E. Merck,\" ''Business History Review''. Volume: 83. Issue: 3. 2009. pp 475+. in [[ProQuest]]</ref>\n\nBy the start of [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), German industry switched to war production. The heaviest demands were on coal and steel for artillery and shell production, and on chemicals for the synthesis of materials that were subject to import restrictions and for chemical weapons and war supplies.\n\n===Consolidation===\nThe creation of the Empire under Prussian leadership was a victory for the concept of ''[[Kleindeutschland and Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Kleindeutschland]]'' (Smaller Germany) over the ''Gro\u00dfdeutschland'' concept. This meant that Austria-Hungary, a multi-ethnic Empire with a considerable German-speaking population, would remain outside of the German nation state. Bismarck's policy was to pursue a solution diplomatically. The effective alliance between Germany and Austria played a major role in Germany's decision to enter [[Causes of World War I|World War I]] in 1914.\n\nBismarck announced there would be no more territorial additions to Germany in Europe, and his diplomacy after 1871 was focused on stabilizing the European system and preventing any wars. He succeeded, and only after his ouster in 1890 did the diplomatic tensions start rising again.<ref>J.A.S. Grenville, ''Europe reshaped, 1848\u20131878'' (2000) p. 342</ref>\n\n===Social issues===\nAfter achieving formal unification in 1871, Bismarck devoted much of his attention to the cause of national unity. He opposed conservative Catholic activism and emancipation, especially the powers of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] under [[Pope Pius IX]], and working class radicalism, represented by the emerging [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]].\n\n====Kulturkampf====\n{{main article|Kulturkampf}}{{See also|Pope Pius IX and Germany}}\n[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Tensions between Germany and the Catholic Church hierarchy are depicted in a chess game between Bismarck and [[Pope Pius IX]].<br>''Between Berlin and Rome'', [[Kladderadatsch]], 1875.]]\nPrussia in 1871 included 16,000,000 Protestants, both Reformed and Lutheran, and 8,000,000 Catholics. Most people were generally segregated into their own religious worlds, living in rural districts or city neighbourhoods that were overwhelmingly of the same religion, and sending their children to separate public schools where their religion was taught. There was little interaction or intermarriage. On the whole, the Protestants had a higher social status, and the Catholics were more likely to be peasant farmers or unskilled or semiskilled industrial workers. In 1870, the Catholics formed their own political party, the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], which generally supported unification and most of Bismarck's policies. However, Bismarck distrusted parliamentary democracy in general and opposition parties in particular, especially when the Centre Party showed signs of gaining support among dissident elements such as the Polish Catholics in Silesia. A powerful intellectual force of the time was [[anti-Catholicism]], led by the liberal intellectuals who formed a vital part of Bismarck's coalition. They saw the Catholic Church as a powerful force of reaction and anti-modernity, especially after the proclamation of papal infallibility in 1870, and the tightening control of the Vatican over the local bishops.<ref>Marjorie Lamberti,   \"Religious conflicts and German national identity in Prussia, 1866\u20131914\", in Philip G. Dwyer, ed. ''Modern Prussian History: 1830\u20131947'' (2001) pp. 169\u2013187</ref>\n\nThe Kulturkampf launched by Bismarck 1871\u20131880 affected Prussia; although there were similar movements in Baden and Hesse, the rest of Germany was not affected. According to the new imperial constitution, the states were in charge of religious and educational affairs; they funded the Protestant and Catholic schools. In July 1871 Bismarck abolished the Catholic section of the Prussian Ministry of ecclesiastical and educational affairs, depriving Catholics of their voice at the highest level. The system of strict [[state education|government supervision of schools]] was applied only in Catholic areas; the Protestant schools were left alone.<ref>Lamberti, (2001) p 177</ref>\n\nMuch more serious were the May laws of 1873. One made the appointment of any priest dependent on his attendance at a German university, as opposed to the seminaries that the Catholics typically used. Furthermore, all candidates for the ministry had to pass an examination in German culture before a state board which weeded out intransigent Catholics. Another provision gave the government a veto power over most church activities. A second law abolished the jurisdiction of the Vatican over the Catholic Church in Prussia; its authority was transferred to a government body controlled by Protestants.<ref>Ronald J. Ross, ''The failure of Bismarck's Kulturkampf: Catholicism and state power in imperial Germany, 1871\u20131887'' (1998)</ref>\n\nNearly all German bishops, clergy, and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws, and were defiant in the face of heavier and heavier penalties and imprisonments imposed by Bismarck's government. By 1876, all the Prussian bishops were imprisoned or in exile, and a third of the Catholic [[parish]]es were without a priest. In the face of systematic defiance, the Bismarck government increased the penalties and its attacks, and were challenged in 1875 when a papal encyclical declared the whole ecclesiastical legislation of Prussia was invalid, and threatened to excommunicate any Catholic who obeyed. There was no violence, but the Catholics mobilized their support, set up numerous civic organizations, raised money to pay fines, and rallied behind their church and the Centre Party. The \"[[Old Catholic Church]]\", which rejected the First Vatican Council, attracted only a few thousand members. Bismarck, a devout pietistic Protestant, realized his Kulturkampf was backfiring when secular and socialist elements used the opportunity to attack all religion. In the long run, the most significant result was the mobilization of the Catholic voters, and their insistence on protecting their religious identity. In the elections of 1874, the Centre party doubled its popular vote, and became the second-largest party in the national parliament\u2014and remained a powerful force for the next 60 years, so that after Bismarck it became difficult to form a government without their support.<ref>Hajo Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840\u20131945'' (1969), pp. 258\u2013260</ref><ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600\u20131947'' (2006) pp. 568\u2013576</ref>\n\n====Social reform====\nBismarck built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as in the 1840s. In the 1880s he introduced old-age pensions, accident insurance, medical care and unemployment insurance that formed the basis of the modern [[European welfare state]]. He came to realize that this sort of policy was very appealing, since it bound workers to the state, and also fit in very well with his authoritarian nature. The social security systems installed by Bismarck (health care in 1883, accident insurance in 1884, invalidity and old-age insurance in 1889) at the time were the largest in the world and, to a degree, still exist in Germany today.\n\nBismarck's paternalistic programs won the support of German industry because its goals were to win the support of the working classes for the Empire and reduce the outflow of immigrants to America, where wages were higher but welfare did not exist.<ref name=\"P. Hennock, 2007\"/><ref>Hermann Beck, ''Origins of the Authoritarian Welfare State in Prussia, 1815\u20131870'' (1995)</ref> Bismarck further won the support of both industry and skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade.<ref>Elaine Glovka Spencer, \"Rules of the Ruhr: Leadership and Authority in German Big Business Before 1914\", ''Business History Review,'' Spring 1979, Vol. 53 Issue 1, pp. 40\u201364; Ivo N. Lambi, \"The Protectionist Interests of the German Iron and Steel Industry, 1873\u20131879\", ''Journal of Economic History'', March 1962, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp. 59\u201370</ref>\n\n=====Germanisation=====\nOne of the effects of the unification policies was the gradually increasing tendency to eliminate the use of non-German languages in public life, schools and academic settings with the intent of pressuring the non-German population to abandon their national identity in what was called \"[[Germanisation]]\". These policies often had the reverse effect of stimulating resistance, usually in the form of home schooling and tighter unity in the minority groups, especially the Poles.<ref>Timothy Baycroft and Mark Hewitson, ''What is a nation?: Europe 1789\u20131914'' (2006) p 166</ref>\n\nThe Germanisation policies were targeted particularly [[Germanisation of Poles during Partitions|against the significant Polish minority]] of the empire, gained by Prussia in the [[partitions of Poland]]. Poles were treated as an [[ethnic minority]] even where they made up the majority, as in the [[Province of Posen]], where a series of anti-Polish measures was enforced.<ref>John J. Kulczycki, ''School Strikes in Prussian Poland, 1901\u20131907: The Struggle over Bilingual Education'' (Columbia University Press, 1981)</ref> Numerous anti-Polish laws had no great effect especially in the [[province of Posen]] where the German-speaking population dropped from 42.8% in 1871 to 38.1% in 1905, despite all efforts.<ref>[[Martin Broszat]]: ''Zweihundert Jahre deutsche Polenpolitik''. suhrkamp 1978, p. 144; {{ISBN|3-518-36574-6}}</ref>\n\n====Antisemitism====\n[[Antisemitism]] was endemic in Germany during the period. Before Napoleon's decrees ended the ghettos in Germany, it had been religiously motivated, but by the 19th century, it was a factor in German nationalism. The last legal barriers on Jews in Prussia were lifted by the 1860s, and within 20 years, they were over-represented in the white-collar professions and much of academia.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the popular mind Jews became a symbol of capitalism and wealth. On the other hand, the constitution and legal system protected the rights of Jews as German citizens. Antisemitic parties were formed but soon collapsed.<ref>Richard S. Levy, ''The Downfall of the Anti-Semitic Political Parties in Imperial Germany'' (Yale University Press, 1975)</ref>\n\n===Law===\nBismarck's efforts also initiated the levelling of the enormous differences between the German states, which had been independent in their evolution for centuries, especially with legislation. The completely different legal histories and judicial systems posed enormous complications, especially for national trade. While a common trade code had already been introduced by the [[German Confederation|Confederation]] in 1861 (which was adapted for the Empire and, with great modifications, is still in effect today), there was little similarity in laws otherwise.\n\nIn 1871, a common Criminal Code (''Reichsstrafgesetzbuch'') was introduced; in 1877, common court procedures were established in the court system (''Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz''), civil procedures (''Zivilprozessordnung'') and criminal procedures (''Strafprozessordnung''). In 1873 the constitution was amended to allow the Empire to replace the various and greatly differing Civil Codes of the states (If they existed at all; for example, parts of Germany formerly occupied by Napoleon's France had adopted the French Civil Code, while in Prussia the ''Allgemeines Preu\u00dfisches Landrecht'' of 1794 was still in effect). In 1881, a first commission was established to produce a common Civil Code for all of the Empire, an enormous effort that would produce the ''B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch'' ([[B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]), possibly one of the most impressive legal works in the world; it was eventually put into effect on 1 January 1900. All of these [[Codification (law)|codification]]s are, albeit with many amendments, still in effect today.\n\n===Constitution===\n{{main article|Constitution of the German Empire}}\n\nThe Empire's legislation was based on two organs, the Bundesrat and the Reichstag (parliament). There was universal male suffrage for the Reichstag, however legislation would have to pass both houses. The Bundesrat contained representatives of the states.\n\n==Year of three emperors==\n[[File:FriedIII.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]], emperor for only 99 days (9 March{{spaced ndash}}15 June 1888).]]\n{{Main article|Year of Three Emperors}}\n\nOn 9 March 1888, Wilhelm I died shortly before his 91st birthday, leaving his son [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] as the new emperor. Frederick was a liberal and an admirer of the British constitution,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cambridge Illustrated History of Germany |first=Martin |last=Kitchen |year= 2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-79432-9 |page=214}}</ref> while his links to Britain strengthened further with his marriage to [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]], eldest child of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. With his ascent to the throne, many hoped that Frederick's reign would lead to a [[liberalisation]] of the Reich and an increase of parliament's influence on the political process. The dismissal of [[Robert von Puttkamer]], the highly-conservative [[Interior Minister of Prussia|Prussian interior minister]], on 8 June was a sign of the expected direction and a blow to Bismarck's administration.\n\nBy the time of his accession, however, Frederick had developed incurable [[laryngeal cancer]], which had been diagnosed in 1887. He died on the 99th day of his rule, on 15 June 1888. His son [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] became emperor.\n\n==Wilhelmine era==\n\n===Bismarck's resignation===\n[[File:Kohner - Kaiser Wilhelm II.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]].<br/>Oil painting by [[Max Koner]], 1890.]]\n\n[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] wanted to reassert his ruling prerogatives at a time when other monarchs in Europe were being transformed into constitutional figureheads. This decision led the ambitious Kaiser into conflict with Bismarck. The old chancellor had hoped to guide Wilhelm as he had guided his grandfather, but the emperor wanted to be the master in his own house and had many sycophants telling him that Frederick the Great would not have been great with a Bismarck at his side.<ref name=\"kurtz_p60\">{{Cite book|last=Kurtz |first=Harold |year=1970 |title=The Second Reich: Kaiser Wilhelm II and his Germany |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-035653-5 |page=60}}</ref> A key difference between Wilhelm II and Bismarck was their approaches to handling political crises, especially in 1889, when German coal miners went on strike in [[Upper Silesia]].

Unlike his grandfather, Wilhelm I, who had been largely content to leave government affairs to the chancellor, Wilhelm II wanted to be fully informed and actively involved in running Germany, not an ornamental figurehead, although most Germans found his claims of divine right to rule amusing.<ref name=\"kurtz_p63\">Kurtz, Harold (1970) 63</ref> Wilhelm allowed politician [[Walther Rathenau]] to tutor him in European economics and industrial and financial realities in Europe.<ref name=\"kurtz_p63\"/>\n\nAs [[Isabel V.

Hull]], ''The Entourage of Kaiser Wilhelm II, 1888\u20131918'' (2004) p. 85</ref> Wilhelm became internationally notorious for his aggressive stance on foreign policy and his strategic blunders (such as the [[First Moroccan Crisis|Tangier Crisis]]), which pushed the German Empire into growing political isolation and eventually helped to cause [[World War I]].\n\n===Domestic affairs===\n[[File:Reichstagsgebaeude.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Reichstag building|Reichstag]]'' in the 1890s{{\\}}early 1900s.]]\n\nUnder Wilhelm II, Germany no longer had long-ruling strong chancellors like Bismarck. The new chancellors had difficulty in performing their roles, especially the additional role as [[Prime Minister of Prussia]] assigned to them in the German Constitution. The reforms of Chancellor [[Leo von Caprivi]], which liberalized trade and so reduced unemployment, were supported by the Kaiser and most Germans except for Prussian landowners, who feared loss of land and power and launched several campaigns against the reforms.<ref name=\"kurtz_p67\">Kurtz, Harold (1970) 67</ref>\n\nWhile Prussian aristocrats challenged the demands of a united German state, in the 1890s several organizations were set up to challenge the authoritarian conservative Prussian militarism which was being imposed on the country. Educators opposed to the German state-run schools, which emphasized military education, set up their own independent liberal schools, which encouraged individuality and freedom.<ref name=\"kurtz_p72\">Kurtz, Harold (1970) 72</ref> However nearly all the schools in Imperial Germany had a very high standard and kept abreast with modern developments in knowledge.<ref>Geoffrey Cocks and Konrad H.

The threat of the SPD to the German monarchy and industrialists caused the state both to crack down on the party's supporters and to implement its own programme of social reform to soothe discontent. Germany's large industries provided significant social welfare programmes and good care to their employees, as long as they were not identified as socialists or trade-union members. The larger industrial firms provided pensions, sickness benefits and even housing to their employees.<ref name=\"kurtz_p72\"/>\n\nHaving learned from the failure of Bismarck's [[Kulturkampf]], Wilhelm II maintained good relations with the Roman Catholic Church and concentrated on opposing socialism.<ref name=\"kurtz_p56\">Kurtz, Harold (1970) 56</ref> This policy failed when the Social Democrats won a third of the votes in the 1912 elections to the ''Reichstag'', and became the largest political party in Germany. The government remained in the hands of a succession of conservative coalitions supported by right-wing liberals or Catholic clerics and heavily dependent on the Kaiser's favour. The rising militarism under Wilhelm II caused many Germans to emigrate to the U.S. and the British colonies to escape mandatory military service.\n\nDuring World War I, the Kaiser increasingly devolved his powers to the leaders of the German High Command, particularly future [[President of Germany]], Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and ''Generalquartiermeister'' [[Erich Ludendorff]]. Hindenburg took over the role of commander\u2013in\u2013chief from the Kaiser, while Ludendorff became de facto general chief of staff. By 1916, Germany was effectively a military dictatorship run by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, with the Kaiser reduced to a mere figurehead.<ref>Lamar Cecil, ''Wilhelm II: Emperor and Exile, 1900\u20131941'' (1996) ch 9\u201313</ref>\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{Main article|German colonial empire}}\n[[File:Kongokonferenz.jpg|thumb|[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] at the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference, 1884]]]]\n\nWilhelm II wanted Germany to have her \"[[place in the sun]]\", like Britain, which he constantly wished to emulate or rival.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wilhelm II (1859\u20131941)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/wilhelm_kaiser_ii.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> With German traders and merchants already active worldwide, he encouraged colonial efforts in Africa and the Pacific (\"[[new imperialism]]\"), causing the German Empire to vie with other European powers for remaining \"unclaimed\" territories. With the encouragement or at least the acquiescence of Britain, which at this stage saw Germany as a counterweight to her old rival France, Germany acquired [[German South-West Africa|German Southwest Africa]] (modern [[Namibia]]), [[Kamerun|German Kamerun]] (modern [[Cameroon]]), [[Togoland]] (modern [[Togo]]) and [[German East Africa]] (modern [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], and the mainland part of current [[Tanzania]]). Islands were gained in the Pacific through purchase and treaties and also a 99-year lease for the territory of [[Kiautschou]] in northeast China. But of these German colonies only Togoland and [[German Samoa]] (after 1908) became self-sufficient and profitable; all the others required subsidies from the Berlin treasury for building infrastructure, school systems, hospitals and other institutions.\n\n[[File:Reichskolonialflagge.svg|thumb|left|German colonial flag]]\n\nBismarck had originally dismissed the agitation for colonies with contempt; he favoured a Eurocentric foreign policy, as the treaty arrangements made during his tenure in office show. As a latecomer to colonization, Germany repeatedly came into conflict with the established colonial powers and also with the United States, which opposed German attempts at colonial expansion in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. Native insurrections in German territories received prominent coverage in other countries, especially in Britain; the established powers had dealt with such uprisings decades earlier, often brutally, and had secured firm control of their colonies by then. The [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer Rising]] in China, which the Chinese government eventually sponsored, began in the Shandong province, in part because Germany, as colonizer at [[Kiautschou]], was an untested power and had only been active there for two years. Eight western nations, including the United States, mounted a joint relief force to rescue westerners caught up in the rebellion. During the departure ceremonies for the German contingent, Wilhelm II urged them to behave like the [[Hun]] invaders of continental Europe \u2013 an unfortunate remark that would later be resurrected by British propagandists to paint Germans as barbarians during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. On two occasions, a French-German conflict over the fate of Morocco seemed inevitable.\n\n[[File:Hissen der kaiserlichen Flagge auf Mioko.jpg|thumb|Hoisting the German flag at [[Duke of York Islands|Mioko]], [[German New Guinea]] in 1884]]\n\nUpon acquiring Southwest Africa, German settlers were encouraged to cultivate land held by the [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]]. Herero and Nama tribal lands were used for a variety of exploitative goals (much as the British did before in [[Rhodesia]]), including farming, ranching, and mining for minerals and [[diamonds]]. In 1904, the Herero and the Nama revolted against the colonists in Southwest Africa, killing farm families, their laborers and servants. In response to the attacks, troops were dispatched to quell the uprising which then resulted in the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]]. In total, some 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Nama (50% of the total Nama population) perished. The commander of the punitive expedition, General [[Lothar von Trotha]], was eventually relieved and reprimanded for his usurpation of orders and the cruelties he inflicted. These occurrences were sometimes referred to as \"the first genocide of the 20th century\" and officially condemned by the United Nations in 1985. In 2004 a formal apology by a government minister of the Federal Republic of Germany followed.\n\n===Middle East===\nBismarck and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] after him sought closer economic ties with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], with the financial backing of the [[Deutsche Bank]], the [[Baghdad Railway]] was begun in 1900, although by 1914 it was still {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} short of its destination in Baghdad.<ref name=\"sturmer_p91\">St\u00fcrmer, Michael (2000) 91</ref> In an interview with Wilhelm in 1899, [[Cecil Rhodes]] had tried \"to convince the Kaiser that the future of the German empire abroad lay in the Middle East\" and not in Africa; with a grand Middle-Eastern empire, Germany could afford to allow Britain the unhindered completion of the Cape-to-Cairo railway that Rhodes favoured.<ref>Louis, ''Ruanda-Urundi 1884\u20131919'', p. 163</ref> Britain initially supported the [[Baghdad Railway]]; but by 1911 British statesmen came to fear it might be extended to [[Basra]] on the [[Persian Gulf]], threatening Britain's naval supremacy in the Indian Ocean. Accordingly, they asked to have construction halted, to which Germany and the Ottoman Empire acquiesced.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|Causes of World War I|Diplomatic history of World War I}}\nWilhelm II and his advisers committed a fatal diplomatic error when they allowed the \"[[Reinsurance Treaty]]\" that Bismarck had negotiated with Tsarist Russia to lapse. Germany was left with no firm ally but [[Austria-Hungary]], and her support for action in annexing [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908 further soured relations with Russia.<ref>Austria's Werner Abelshauser, ''German History and Global Enterprise: BASF: The History of a Company'' (2004) covers 1865 to 2000;</ref> Wilhelm missed the opportunity to secure an alliance with Britain in the 1890s when it was involved in colonial rivalries with France, and he alienated British statesmen further by openly supporting the Boers in the [[South African War]] and building a navy to rival Britain's. By 1911 Wilhelm had completely picked apart the careful power balance established by Bismarck and Britain turned to France in the [[Entente Cordiale]]. Germany's only other ally besides Austria was the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]], but it remained an ally only ''pro forma''. When war came, Italy saw more benefit in an alliance with Britain, France, and Russia, which, in the secret [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] in 1915 promised it the frontier districts of Austria where Italians formed the majority of the population and also colonial concessions. Germany did acquire a second ally that same year when the Ottoman Empire entered the war on its side, but in the long run supporting the Ottoman war effort only drained away German resources from the main fronts.\n\n==World War I==\n{{See also|History of Germany during World War I}}\n\n===Origins===\n{{Main|German entry into World War I}}\n[[File:WWI-re.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Map of the world showing the [[participants in World War I]].

This unconditional support for Austria-Hungary was called a \"blank cheque\" by historians, including German [[Fritz Fischer]]. Subsequent interpretation \u2013 for example at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]] \u2013 was that this \"blank cheque\" licensed Austro-Hungarian aggression regardless of the diplomatic consequences, and thus [[War Guilt Clause|Germany bore responsibility for starting the war]], or at least provoking a wider conflict.\n\nGermany began the war by targeting its chief rival, France. Germany saw France as its principal danger on the European continent as it could mobilize much faster than Russia and bordered Germany's industrial core in the [[Rhineland]]. Unlike Britain and Russia, the French entered the war mainly for revenge against Germany, in particular for France's [[Franco-Prussian War|loss]] of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] to Germany in 1871. The German high command knew that France would muster its forces to go into Alsace-Lorraine. Aside from the very unofficial [[Septemberprogramm]], the Germans never stated a clear list of goals that they wanted out of the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Matthew Stibbe|title=German Anglophobia and the Great War, 1914-1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCGEPwGvqVUC&pg=PA177|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=176\u2013178}}</ref>\n\n===Western Front===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R19231, Berlin, Mobilmachung.jpg|thumb|The mobilization in 1914]]\n\nGermany did not want to risk lengthy battles along the Franco-German border and instead adopted the [[Schlieffen Plan]], a military strategy designed to cripple France by [[Rape of Belgium|invading Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], sweeping down to encircle and crush both Paris and the French forces along the Franco-German border in a quick victory. After defeating France, Germany would turn to attack Russia. The plan required violating the official neutrality of Belgium and Luxembourg, which [[British Empire|Britain]] had guaranteed by treaty. However, the Germans had calculated that Britain would enter the war regardless of whether they had formal justification to do so.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} At first the attack was successful: the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] swept down from Belgium and Luxembourg and advanced on Paris, at the nearby [[River Marne]]. However, the evolution of weapons over the last century heavily favored defense over offense, especially thanks to the machine gun, so that it took proportionally more offensive force to overcome a defensive position. This resulted in the German lines on the offense contracting to keep up the offensive time table while correspondingly the French lines were extending. In addition, some German units that were originally slotted for the German far right were transferred to the Eastern Front in reaction to Russia mobilizing far faster than anticipated. The combined affect had the German right flank sweeping down in front of Paris instead of behind it exposing the German Right flank to the extending French lines and attack from strategic French reserves stationed in Paris. Attacking the exposed German right flank, the [[French Army]] and the [[British Army]] put up a strong resistance to the defense of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne]], resulting in the German Army retreating.\n\nThe aftermath of the First Battle of the Marne was a long-held stalemate between the German Army and the Allies in dug-in [[trench warfare]]. Further German attempts to break through deeper into France failed at the two battles of [[Ypres]] ([[First Battle of Ypres|1st]]/[[Second Battle of Ypres|2nd]]) with huge casualties. German [[Chief of Staff]] [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] decided to break away from the Schlieffen Plan and instead focus on a [[war of attrition]] against France. Falkenhayn targeted the ancient city of [[Verdun]] because it had been one of the last cities to hold out against the German Army in 1870, and Falkenhayn knew that as a matter of national pride the French would do anything to ensure that it was not taken. He expected that with proper tactics, French losses would be greater than those of the Germans and that continued French commitment of troops to Verdun would \"bleed the French Army white\" and then allow the German army to take France easily. In 1916, the [[Battle of Verdun]] began, with the French positions under constant shelling and poison gas attack and taking large casualties under the assault of overwhelmingly large German forces. However, Falkenhayn's prediction of a greater ratio of French killed proved to be wrong. Falkenhayn was replaced by [[Erich Ludendorff]], and with no success in sight, the German Army pulled out of Verdun in December 1916 and the battle ended.\n\n===Eastern Front===\n[[File:Map Treaty of Brest-Litovsk-de.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Front line at the time of cease-fire and at the time of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]]]\n\nWhile the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] was a stalemate for the German Army, the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] eventually proved to be a great success. Despite initial setbacks due to the unexpectedly rapid mobilisation of the Russian army, which resulted in a Russian invasion of East Prussia and Austrian [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], the badly organised and supplied [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|faltered]] and the German and Austro-Hungarian armies thereafter steadily advanced eastward. The Germans benefited from political instability in [[Russia]] and its population's desire to end the war. In 1917 the German government allowed Russia's communist [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] to travel through Germany from [[Switzerland]] into Russia. Germany believed that if Lenin could create further political unrest, Russia would no longer be able to continue its war with Germany, allowing the German Army to focus on the Western Front.\n\nIn March 1917, the [[Tsar]] was ousted from the Russian throne, and in November a [[Bolshevik]] government came to power under the leadership of Lenin. Facing political opposition from the Bolsheviks, he decided to end Russia's campaign against Germany, [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Bulgaria]] in order to redirect Bolshevik energy to eliminating internal dissent. In March 1918, by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], the Bolshevik government gave Germany and the Ottoman Empire enormous territorial and economic concessions in exchange for an end to war on the Eastern Front. All of the modern-day [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], Latvia and [[Lithuania]]) were given over to the German occupation authority ''[[Ober Ost]]'', along with [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. Thus Germany had at last achieved its long-wanted dominance of \"Mitteleuropa\" (Central Europe) and could now focus fully on defeating the Allies on the Western Front. In practice, however, the forces that were needed to garrison and secure the new territories were a drain on the German war effort.\n\n===Colonies===\nGermany quickly lost almost all its colonies. However, in [[German East Africa]], an impressive guerrilla campaign was waged by the colonial army leader there, General [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck|Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck]]. Using Germans and native [[Askari]]s, Lettow-Vorbeck launched multiple guerrilla raids against British forces in [[Kenya]] and [[Rhodesia]]. He also invaded [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Mozambique]] to gain his forces supplies and to pick up more Askari recruits. His force was still active at war's end.<ref>Edwin Hoyt, ''Colonel von Lettow-Vorbeck and Germany's East African Empire'' (1981)</ref>\n\n===1918===\nDefeating Russia in 1917 enabled Germany to transfer hundreds of thousands of combat troops from the east to the Western Front, giving it a numerical advantage over the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]]. By retraining the soldiers in new [[stormtrooper]] tactics, the Germans expected to unfreeze the battlefield and win a decisive victory before the army of the [[United States]], which had now entered the war on the side of Britain and France, arrived in strength.<ref>Holger H. Herwig, ''The First World War: Germany and Austria\u2013Hungary 1914\u20131918'' (1996)</ref> However, the repeated German offensives in the autumn of 1917 and the spring of 1918 all failed, as the Allies fell back and regrouped and the Germans lacked the [[military reserve|reserves]] needed to consolidate their gains. Meanwhile, soldiers had become radicalised by the [[Russian Revolution]] and were less willing to continue fighting. The war effort sparked civil unrest in Germany, while the troops, who had been constantly in the field without relief, grew exhausted and lost all hope of victory. In the summer of 1918, with the Americans arriving at the rate of 10,000 a day and the German reserves spent, it was only a matter of time before multiple Allied offensives destroyed the German army.<ref>Rod Paschall, ''The defeat of imperial Germany, 1917\u20131918'' (1994)</ref>\n\n===Home front===\n[[File:Gedenkstein An der Wuhlheide 131a (Oschw) Opfer des 1 Weltkrieges3.jpg|thumb|A memorial to soldiers killed in World War I]]\n\nThe concept of \"[[total war]]\" meant that supplies had to be redirected towards the armed forces and, with German commerce being stopped by the Allied [[naval blockade]], German civilians were forced to live in increasingly meagre conditions. First food prices were controlled, then rationing was introduced. During the war about 750,000 German civilians died from malnutrition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/wk1/wirtschaft/versorgung/index.html |title=1914\u201318: Lebensmittelversorgung |author=[[German Historical Museum]] |language=German}}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the war conditions deteriorated rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas. The causes included the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, combined with the overburdened railway system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade. The winter of 1916\u20131917 was known as the \"turnip winter\", because the people had to survive on a vegetable more commonly reserved for livestock, as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the soldiers' rations.<ref>Roger Chickering, ''Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914\u20131918'' (2004) p. 141\u201342</ref> The morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.\n\n===Revolt and demise===\nMany Germans wanted an end to the war and increasing numbers began to associate with the political left, such as the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] and the more radical [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]], which demanded an end to the war. The [[American entry into World War I|entry of the U.S.]] into the war in April 1917 changed the long-run [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] in favour of the Allies.\n\nThe end of October 1918, in [[Kiel]], in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]]. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost, initiating the uprising. On 3 November, the revolt spread to other cities and states of the country, in many of which workers' and soldiers' councils were established. Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior generals lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government.\n\n[[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] signed the [[Armistice of Solun]] on 29 September 1918. The [[Ottoman Empire]] signed the [[Armistice of Mudros]] on 30 October 1918. Between 24 October and 3 November 1918, [[Italy]] defeated [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[battle of Vittorio Veneto]], which forced Austria-Hungary to sign the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] on 3 November 1918. So, in November 1918, with internal revolution, the Allies [[Hundred Days Offensive|advancing toward Germany on the Western Front]], Austria-Hungary falling apart from multiple ethnic tensions, its other allies out of the war and pressure from the German high command, the Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated. On 9 November, the Social Democrat [[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaimed a republic. The new government led by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democrats]] called for and received an [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]] on 11 November. It was succeeded by the [[Weimar Republic]].<ref>A. J. Ryder, ''The German Revolution of 1918: A Study of German Socialism in War and Revolt'' (2008)</ref> Those opposed, including disaffected veterans, joined a diverse set of paramilitary and underground political groups such as the [[Freikorps]], the [[Organisation Consul]], and the Communists.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe defeat and [[aftermath of the First World War]] and the penalties imposed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] shaped the positive memory of the Empire, especially among Germans who distrusted and despised the Weimar Republic. Conservatives, liberals, socialists, nationalists, Catholics and Protestants all had their own interpretations, which led to a fractious political and social climate in Germany in the aftermath of the empire's collapse.\n\n[[File:War Ensign of Germany 1903-1918.svg|thumb|[[Reichskriegsflagge|War flag of the]] German Empire. In 1956, the [[Iron Cross]] was re-introduced as the symbol of the ''{{lang|de|[[Bundeswehr]]}}'', the modern German armed forces.]]\nUnder Bismarck, a united German state had finally been achieved, but it remained a Prussian-dominated state and did not include German Austria as [[Pan-German]] nationalists had desired. The influence of Prussian [[militarism]], the Empire\u2019s colonial efforts and its vigorous, competitive industrial prowess all gained it the dislike and envy of other nations. The German Empire enacted a number of progressive reforms, such as Europe's first social welfare system and freedom of press. There was also a modern system for electing the federal parliament, the Reichstag, in which every adult man had one vote. This enabled the Socialists and the Catholic Centre Party to play considerable roles in the empire's political life despite the continued hostility of Prussian aristocrats.\n\nThe era of the German Empire is well remembered in Germany as one of great cultural and intellectual vigour. [[Thomas Mann]] published his novel ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'' in 1901. [[Theodor Mommsen]] received the [[Nobel prize for literature]] a year later for his Roman history. Painters like the groups [[Der Blaue Reiter]] and [[Die Br\u00fccke]] made a significant contribution to modern art. The [[AEG turbine factory]] in Berlin by [[Peter Behrens]] from 1909 can be regarded as a milestone in classic modern architecture and an outstanding example of emerging functionalism. The social, economic, and scientific successes of this ''[[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]]'', or founding epoch, have sometimes led the Wilhelmine era to be regarded as a [[golden age]].\n\nIn the field of economics, the \"''Kaiserzeit''\" laid the foundation of Germany's status as one of the world's leading economic powers. The iron and coal industries of the [[Ruhr]], the [[Saarland|Saar]] and [[Upper Silesia]] especially contributed to that process. The first motorcar was built by [[Karl Benz]] in 1886. The enormous growth of industrial production and industrial potential also led to a rapid urbanisation of Germany, which turned the Germans into a nation of city dwellers. More than 5 million people left Germany for the [[German American|United States]] during the 19th century.<ref>\"[https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/german4.html A New Surge of Growth]\". [[Library of Congress]].</ref>\n\n===Sonderweg===\n{{main article|Sonderweg}}\n\nMany historians have emphasized the central importance of a German ''[[Sonderweg]]'' or \"special path\" (or \"exceptionalism\") as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the 20th century. According to the historiography by Kocka (1988), the process of nation-building from above had very grievous long-term implications. In terms of parliamentary democracy, Parliament was kept weak, the parties were fragmented, and there was a high level of mutual distrust. The Nazis built on the illiberal, anti-pluralist elements of Weimar's political culture. The Junker elites (the large landowners in the east) and senior civil servants used their great power and influence well into the twentieth century to frustrate any movement toward democracy. They played an especially negative role in the crisis of 1930\u20131933. Bismarck's emphasis on military force amplified the voice of the officer corps, which combined advanced modernisation of military technology with reactionary politics. The rising upper-middle class elites, in the business, financial and professional worlds, tended to accept the values of the old traditional elites. The German Empire was for Hans-Ulrich Wehler a strange mixture of highly successful capitalist industrialisation and socio-economic modernisation on the one hand, and of surviving pre-industrial institutions, power relations and traditional cultures on the other. Wehler argues that it produced a high degree of internal tension, which led on the one hand to the suppression of socialists, Catholics and reformers, and on the other hand to a highly aggressive foreign policy. For these reasons [[Fritz Fischer]] and his students emphasised Germany\u2019s primary guilt for causing the First World War.<ref>J\u00fcrgen Kocka, \"German History before Hitler: The Debate about the German 'Sonderweg{{'\"}}. ''Journal of Contemporary History,'' Jan 1988, Vol. 23#1, pp 3\u201316 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/260865 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n[[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], a leader of the [[Bielefeld School]] of social history, places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s\u20131870s, when economic modernisation took place, but political modernisation did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service. Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernising society. Recognising the importance of modernising forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (''Klassenhabitus''). The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernisation of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's interpretation is his treatment of \"the middle class\" and \"revolution\", each of which was instrumental in shaping the 20th century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of \"charismatic domination\", which focuses heavily on [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref>Wehler, ''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gr\u00fcndung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914\u20131949'' (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society. None of the series has yet been translated into English. A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, ''The German Empire, 1871\u20131918'' (1997)</ref>\n\nThe historiographical concept of a German Sonderweg has had a turbulent history. 19th century scholars who emphasised a separate German path to modernity saw it as a positive factor that differentiated Germany from the \"western path\" typified by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. They stressed the strong bureaucratic state, reforms initiated by Bismarck and other strong leaders, the Prussian service ethos, the high culture of philosophy and music, and Germany's pioneering of a social welfare state. In the 1950s, historians in [[West Germany]] argued that the Sonderweg led Germany to the disaster of 1933\u20131945. The special circumstances of German historical structures and experiences, were interpreted as preconditions that, while not directly causing National Socialism, did hamper the development of a liberal democracy and facilitate the rise of fascism. The Sonderweg paradigm has provided the impetus for at least three strands of research in German historiography: the \"long 19th century\", the history of the bourgeoisie, and comparisons with the West. After 1990, increased attention to cultural dimensions and to comparative and relational history moved German historiography to different topics, with much less attention paid to the Sonderweg. While some historians have abandoned the Sonderweg thesis, they have not provided a generally accepted alternative interpretation.<ref>Helmut Walser Smith, \"When the Sonderweg Debate Left Us\", ''German Studies Review'', May 2008, Vol. 31#2 pp 225\u2013240</ref>\n\n==Territorial legacy==\nIn addition to present-day Germany, large parts of what comprised the German Empire now belong to several other modern European countries.\n[[File:Former German territories.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|German territories lost in both World Wars are shown in black, present-day Germany is marked dark grey on this 1914 map.]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He ruled during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] that nearly caused the collapse of the empire. While he won a number of military victories, he was unable to prevent the secession of important provinces. His 15-year reign was the longest since the 19-year rule of [[Caracalla]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Rise to power===\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0438 \u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d\u044b.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Cornelia Salonina]]\nThe exact birth date of Gallienus is unknown.  The Greek chronicler [[John Malalas]] and the ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' report that he was about 50 years old at the time of his death, meaning he was born around 218.<ref>It is generally accepted that he was 35 years old when ascended to the throne in 253, see J. Bray (1997), p.16</ref> He was the son of emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and [[Mariniana]], who may have been of senatorial rank, possibly the daughter of [[Egnatius Victor Marinianus]], and his brother was [[Valerianus Minor]]. Inscriptions on coins connect him with [[Falerii]] in [[Etruria]], which may have been his birthplace; it has yielded many inscriptions relating to his mother's family, the Egnatii.<ref>R. Syme, ''Historia Augusta Papers'' (Oxford, 1983), p. 197.</ref>  Gallienus married [[Cornelia Salonina]] about ten years before his accession to the throne. She was the mother of three princes: [[Valerian II]], who died in 258; [[Saloninus]], who was named co-emperor but was murdered in 260 by the army of general Postumus; and [[Marinianus]], who was killed in 268, shortly after his father was assassinated.<ref>J. Bray (1997), pp.49\u201351</ref>\n\nWhen [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] was proclaimed Emperor on 22 October 253, he asked the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to ratify the elevation of Gallienus to Caesar and [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]. He was also designated [[Roman consul|Consul Ordinarius]] for 254.  As [[Marcus Aurelius]] and his adopted brother [[Lucius Verus]] had done a century earlier, Gallienus and his father divided the Empire. Valerian left for the East to stem the Persian threat, and Gallienus remained in Italy to repel the Germanic tribes on the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]]. [[Tetrarchy|Division of the empire]] had become necessary due to its sheer size and the numerous threats it faced, and it facilitated negotiations with enemies who demanded to communicate directly with the emperor.\n\n===Early reign and the revolt of Ingenuus===\n[[Image:Gallienus lead seal sm.jpg|thumb|Gallienus depicted on a lead [[Seal (device)|seal]]]]\nGallienus spent most of his time in the provinces of the Rhine area ([[Germania Inferior]], [[Germania Superior]], [[Raetia]], and [[Noricum]]), though he almost certainly visited the [[Danube]] area and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] in the years from 253 to 258.  According to Eutropius and Aurelius Victor, he was particularly energetic and successful in preventing invaders from attacking the German provinces and Gaul, despite the weakness caused by Valerian's march on Italy against [[Aemilianus]] in 253.<ref>A. Watson (1999), p.33</ref> According to numismatic evidence, he seems to have won many victories there,<ref>Andreas Alfoldi mentions five in ''The Numbering of the Victories of the Emperor Gallienus and of the Loyalty of his Legions'', ''Numismatic Chronicle'', 1959, reprinted New York, Attic Books, 1977, {{ISBN|0-915018-28-4}}.</ref> and a victory in [[Roman Dacia]] might also be dated to that period. Even the hostile Latin tradition attributes success to him at this time.<ref>J. Bray (1997), pp.56\u201358</ref>\n\nIn 255 or 257, Gallienus was made Consul again, suggesting that he briefly visited Rome on those occasions, although no record survives.<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.56</ref> During his Danube sojourn (Drinkwater suggests in 255 or 256), he proclaimed his elder son [[Valerian II]] Caesar and thus official heir to himself and Valerian I; the boy probably joined Gallienus on campaign at that time, and when Gallienus moved west to the Rhine provinces in 257, he remained behind on the Danube as the personification of Imperial authority.<ref>J. Drinkwater, ''The Gallic Empire'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987, {{ISBN|3-515-04806-5}}), pp. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nSometime between 258 and 260 (the exact date is unclear), while Valerian was distracted with the ongoing invasion of [[Shapur I]] in the East, and Gallienus was preoccupied with his problems in the West, [[Ingenuus]], governor of at least one of the Pannonian provinces,<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.57; Drinkwater (1987), p.22 suggests he also had responsibility for Moesia.</ref> took advantage and declared himself emperor. Valerian II had apparently died on the Danube, most likely in 258.<ref>Drinkwater (1987), p. 22.</ref>  Ingenuus may have been responsible for that calamity. Alternatively, the defeat and capture of Valerian at the [[battle of Edessa]] may have been the trigger for the subsequent revolts of Ingenuus, [[Regalianus]], and [[Postumus]].<ref>For a very thorough presentation of the contrasting views, see J. Bray (1997), p.72-73; also, A. Watson (1999), p.230, note 34</ref> In any case, Gallienus reacted with great speed. He left his son [[Saloninus]] as Caesar at [[Cologne]], under the supervision of Albanus (or Silvanus) and the military leadership of Postumus. He then hastily crossed the [[Balkans]], taking with him the new cavalry corps (''comitatus'') under the command of [[Aureolus]]<ref>J. Bray (1997), pp.74\u201375</ref> and defeated Ingenuus at [[Mursa]]<ref>Aurelius Victor, 33,2, Orosius, ''Historiae adversus Paganos'' 7.10, Eutropius 9.8</ref> or [[Sirmium]].<ref>Zonaras, 12.24</ref> The victory must be attributed mainly to the cavalry and its brilliant commander. Ingenuus was killed by his own guards or committed suicide by drowning himself after the fall of his capital, Sirmium.<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.76. J. Fitz, ''Ingenuus et Regalien'', p.44.</ref>\n\n===Invasion of the Alemanni===\nA major invasion by the [[Alemanni]] and other Germanic tribes occurred between 258 and 260 (it is hard to fix the precise date of these events),<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.47</ref> probably due to the vacuum left by the withdrawal of troops supporting Gallienus in the campaign against Ingenuus.  [[Franks]] broke through the lower Rhine, invading [[Gaul]], some reaching as far as southern Spain, sacking Tarraco (modern [[Tarragona]]).<ref name=Watson34>A. Watson (1999), p.34</ref> The Alemanni invaded, probably through [[Agri Decumates]] (an area between the upper Rhine and the upper Danube),<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.78</ref> likely followed by the [[Juthungi]].<ref name=Watson34>A. Watson (1999), p.34</ref> After devastating Germania Superior and Raetia (parts of southern [[France]] and [[Switzerland]]), they entered Italy, the first invasion of the Italian peninsula, aside from its most remote northern regions, since [[Hannibal]] 500 years before. When invaders reached the outskirts of Rome, they were repelled by an improvised army assembled by the Senate, consisting of local troops (probably praetorian guards) and the strongest of the civilian population.<ref name=Bray79>J. Bray (1997), p.79</ref> On their retreat through northern Italy, they were intercepted and defeated in the [[battle of Mediolanum]] (near present-day [[Milan]]) by Gallienus' army, which had advanced from Gaul, or from the Balkans after dealing with the Franks.<ref name=Bray79>J. Bray (1997), p.79</ref> The battle of Mediolanum was decisive, and the Alemanni did not bother the empire for the next ten years. The Juthungi managed to cross the Alps with their valuables and captives from Italy.<ref name=Watson34>A. Watson (1999), p.34</ref><ref name=Potter256>D.S.Potter (2004), p.256</ref> An historian in the 19th century suggested that the initiative of the Senate gave rise to jealousy and suspicion by Gallienus, thus contributing to his exclusion of senators from military commands.<ref>Victor Duruy, ''History of the Roman Empire'', vol VI, part II, p.418, London, 1886</ref>\n\n===The revolt of Regalianus===\n[[File:Regalianus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Antoninianus]] of Regalianus]]\nAround the same time, [[Regalianus]], who held some command in the Balkans,<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.82</ref> was proclaimed Emperor. The reasons for this are unclear, and the ''Historia Augusta'' (almost the sole resource for these events) does not provide a credible story. It is possible the seizure can be attributed to the discontent of the civilian and military provincials, who felt the defense of the province was being neglected.<ref>J. Bray (1997), pp.82,83</ref>\n\nRegalianus held power for some six months and issued coins bearing his image. After some success against the [[Sarmatians]], his revolt ended when the [[Roxolani]] invaded [[Pannonia]] and killed Regalianus in taking the city of [[Sirmium]].<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.83</ref> There is a suggestion that Gallienus invited the Roxolani to attack Regalianus, but other historians dismiss the accusation.<ref>T. Nagy, ''Les moments historiques de Budapest'', vol.II, 1962, for the former and J. Fitz, ''Ingenuus at Regalien'', p.50 for the latter, as cited in J. Bray (1997), p.83</ref> It is also suggested that the invasion was finally checked by Gallienus near [[Verona]] and that he directed the restoration of the province, probably in person.<ref>J. Fitz, ''LA PANNONIE SOUS GALLIEN'', Latomus, vol.148, Brussels, 1976, pp.5\u201381, as cited in J. Bray (1997), p.83</ref>\n\n===Capture of Valerian, revolt of Macrianus===\n[[Image:Shapur victory.JPG|thumb|left|A [[bas relief]] of Emperor Valerian standing at the background and held captive by [[Shapur I]] was found at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]]. The kneeling man is probably [[Philip the Arab]].]]\nIn the East, Valerian was confronted with serious troubles. Bands of \"[[Scythai]]\" began a naval raid of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], in the northern part of modern Turkey. After ravaging the province, they moved south into [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]]. A Roman army from Antioch, under Valerian, tried to intercept them but failed. According to [[Zosimus]], this army was infected by a plague that gravely weakened it. In that condition, this army had to repel  a new invasion of the province of [[Mesopotamia]] by [[Shapur I]], ruler of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. The invasion occurred probably in the early spring of 260.<ref>D.S.Potter (2004), p. 255</ref>\n\nThe Roman army was defeated at the [[Battle of Edessa]], and Valerian was taken prisoner. Shapur's army raided [[Cilicia]] and [[Cappadocia]] (in present-day [[Turkey]]), sacking, as Shapur's inscriptions claim, 36 cities. It took a rally by an officer named [[Balista|Callistus]] (Balista), a fiscal official named [[Macrianus Major|Fulvius Macrianus]], the remnants of the Roman army in the east, and [[Odaenathus|Odenathus]] and his [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] horsemen to turn the tide against Shapur.<ref>D.S.Potter (2004), pp.255\u2013256</ref> The Sassanids were driven back, but Macrianus proclaimed his two sons [[Quietus]] and [[Macrianus Minor|Macrianus]] (sometimes misspelled Macrinus) as emperors.<ref name=Potter256>D.S.Potter (2004), p.256</ref> Coins struck for them in major cities of the East indicate acknowledgement of the usurpation. The two Macriani left Quietus, Ballista, and, presumably, Odenathus to deal with the Persians while they invaded Europe with an army of 30,000 men, according to the ''Historia Augusta''. At first they met no opposition.<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.142</ref><ref>''Historia Augusta'', ''The two Gallienii'', II.6</ref>\n\nThe Pannonian legions joined the invaders, being resentful of the absence of Gallienus. He sent his successful commander Aureolus against the rebels, however, and the decisive battle was fought in the spring or early summer of 261, most likely in Illyricum, although [[Zonaras]] locates it in Pannonia. In any case, the army of the usurpers was defeated and surrendered, and their two leaders were killed.<ref>J. Bray (1997), pp.143\u2013144</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the rebellion of Postumus had already started, so Gallienus had no time to deal with the rest of the usurpers, namely Balista and Quietus. He came to an agreement with Odenathus, who had just returned from his victorious Persian expedition. Odenathus received the title of ''dux Romanorum'' and besieged the usurpers, who were based at [[Emesa]]. Eventually, the people of Emesa killed Quietus, and Odenathus arrested and executed Balista about November 261.<ref>J. Bray (1997), pp.144\u2013145</ref>\n\n===The revolt of Postumus===\n[[File:Postumus Antoninianus.jpg|thumb|right|Antoninianus of Postumus]]\nAfter the defeat at Edessa, Gallienus lost control over the provinces of Britain, Spain, parts of Germania, and a large part of Gaul when another general, [[Postumus]], declared his own realm (usually known today as the [[Gallic Empire]]). The revolt partially coincided with that of [[Macrianus Major|Macrianus]] in the East. Gallienus had installed his son Saloninus and his guardian, [[Silvanus (praetorian prefect)|Silvanus]], in Cologne in 258. Postumus, a general in command of troops on the banks of the Rhine, defeated some raiders and took possession of their spoils. Instead of returning it to the original owners, he preferred to distribute it amongst his soldiers. When news of this reached Silvanus, he demanded the spoils be sent to him. Postumus made a show of submission, but his soldiers mutinied and proclaimed him Emperor. Under his command, they besieged Cologne, and after some weeks the defenders of the city opened the gates and handed Saloninus and Silvanus to Postumus, who had them killed.<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.133</ref>  The dating of these events was long uncertain,<ref>Andreas \u00c4lfoldi, \"The Numbering of the Victories of the Emperor Gallienus and of the Loyalty of his Legions\", ''Numismatic Chronicle'', 1959, reprinted New York, Attic Books, 1977, as cited in J. Bray (1997), p.359, note 5</ref> but an [[Augsburg Victory Altar|inscription]] discovered in 1992 at [[Augsburg]] indicates that Postumus had been proclaimed Emperor by September of 260.<ref>Lothar Bakker. \"Raetien unter Postumus. Das Siegesdenkmal einer Juthungenschlacht im Jahre 260 n. Chr. aus Augsburg.\" ''Germania'' 71, 1993, pp. 369\u2013386.</ref> Postumus claimed the consulship for himself and one of his associates, Honoratianus, but according to D.S. Potter, he never tried to unseat Gallienus or invade Italy.<ref>D.S.Potter (2004), p.260</ref>\n\nUpon receiving news of the murder of his son, Gallienus began gathering forces to face Postumus.  The invasion of the Macriani forced him to dispatch Aureolus with a large force to oppose them, however, leaving him with insufficient troops to battle Postumus. After some initial defeats, the army of Aureolus, having defeated the Macriani, rejoined him, and Postumus was expelled. Aureolus was entrusted with the pursuit and deliberately allowed Postumus to escape and gather new forces.<ref>J. Bray (1997), pp.136\u2013137</ref> Gallienus returned in 263<ref>Andreas \u00c4lfoldi, \"The Numbering of the Victories of the Emperor Gallienus and of the Loyalty of his Legions\", ''Numismatic Chronicle'', 1959, reprinted New York, Attic Books, 1977, as cited in J. Bray (1997), p.359, note 27</ref> or 265<ref>D.S.Potter (2004) p.263</ref> and surrounded Postumus in an unnamed Gallic city. During the siege, Gallienus was severely wounded by an arrow and had to leave the field. The standstill persisted until his later death,<ref>J.

In spring of 262, the city was wrenched by civil unrest as a result of a new revolt. The rebel this time was the prefect of Egypt, [[Mussius Aemilianus|Lucius Mussius Aemilianus]], who had already given support to the revolt of the Macriani. The correspondence of bishop [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius of Alexandria]] provides a commentary on the background of invasion, civil war, plague, and famine that characterized this age.<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.146</ref>\n\nKnowing he could not afford to lose control of the vital Egyptian granaries, Gallienus sent his general Theodotus against Aemilianus, probably by a naval expedition. The decisive battle probably took place near [[Thebes, Egypt| Thebes]], and the result was a clear defeat of Aemilianus.<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.147</ref> In the aftermath, Gallienus became Consul three more times in 262, 264, and 266.\n\n===Herulian invasions, revolt of Aureolus, conspiracy and death===\nIn the years 267\u2013269, [[Goths]] and other barbarians invaded the empire in great numbers. Sources are extremely confused on the dating of these invasions, the participants, and their targets. Modern historians are not even able to discern with certainty whether there were two or more of these invasions or a single prolonged one. It seems that, at first, a major naval expedition was led by the [[Heruli]] starting from north of the [[Black Sea]] and leading to the ravaging of many cities of Greece (among them, [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]]). Then another, even more numerous army of invaders started a second naval invasion of the empire. The Romans defeated the barbarians on sea first. Gallienus' army then won a battle in [[Thrace]], and the Emperor pursued the invaders. According to some historians, he was the leader of the army who won the great [[Battle of Naissus]], while the majority believes that the victory must be attributed to his successor, [[Claudius II]].<ref>J. Bray (1997), pp.279\u2013288, Pat Southern 2001, p.109. Also see Alaric Watson 1999, p.215, David S. Potter 2004, p.266, Herwig Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'' (transl. by Thomas J. Dunlap), University of California Press, 1988. {{ISBN|0-520-06983-8}}, p.54</ref>\n\nIn 268, at some time before or soon after the battle of Naissus, the authority of Gallienus was challenged by [[Aureolus]], commander of the cavalry stationed in [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]), who was supposed to keep an eye on [[Postumus]]. Instead, he acted as deputy to Postumus until the very last days of his revolt, when he seems to have claimed the throne for himself.<ref>J. Bray (1997), pp.290\u2013291</ref> The decisive battle took place at what is now [[Pontirolo Nuovo]] near Milan; Aureolus was clearly defeated and driven back to Milan.<ref>J. Bray (1997), p.292</ref> Gallienus laid siege to the city but was murdered during the siege. There are differing accounts of the murder, but the sources agree that most of Gallienus' officials wanted him dead.<ref>D.S.Potter (2004), p.264</ref> According to the [[Historia Augusta]], an unreliable source compiled long after the events it describes,<ref>R. Syme (1968)</ref> a conspiracy was led by the commander of the guard [[Aurelius Heraclianus]] and [[Lucius Aurelius Marcianus]]. Marcianus's role in the conspiracy is not confirmed by any other ancient source.\n\nCecropius, commander of the Dalmatians, spread the word that the forces of Aureolus were leaving the city, and Gallienus left his tent without his bodyguard, only to be struck down by Cecropius.<ref>''Historia Augusta, The two Gallieni'', XIV.4\u201311</ref> One version has Claudius selected as Emperor by the conspirators, another chosen by Gallienus on his death bed; the Historia Augusta was concerned to substantiate the descent of the [[Constantinian dynasty]] from Claudius, and this may explain its accounts, which do not involve Claudius in the murder. The other sources ([[Zosimus]] i.40 and [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]] xii.25) report that the conspiracy was organized by Heraclianus, Claudius, and [[Aurelian]].\n\nAccording to Aurelius Victor and Zonaras, on hearing the news that Gallienus was dead, the Senate in Rome ordered the execution of his family (including his brother Valerianus and son Marinianus) and their supporters, just before receiving a message from Claudius to spare their lives and deify his predecessor.<ref>J.

This reform arguably created a precedent for the future emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I]]. The biographer [[Aurelius Victor]] reports that Gallienus forbade [[Roman Senate|senators]] from becoming military commanders.<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''De Caesaribus'', 33\u201334</ref> This policy undermined senatorial power, as more reliable [[Eques (ancient Rome)|equestrian]] commanders rose to prominence. In Southern's view, these reforms and the decline in senatorial influence not only helped Aurelian to salvage the Empire, but they also make Gallienus one of the emperors most responsible for the creation of the [[Dominate]], along with [[Septimius Severus]], Diocletian, and Constantine I.<ref>Southern, pp. 2-3, 83.</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Antoninianus Gallienus 260-leg 2 Italica.jpg|[[Antoninianus]] issued to celebrate <small>LEG II ITAL VII P VII F</small>, \"[[Legio II Italica|Legio II ''Italica'']] seven times faithful and loyal.\"\nImage:Antoninianus Gallienus 260-leg 3 Italica.jpg|Antoninianus issued to celebrate <small>LEG III ITAL VI P VI F</small>, \"[[Legio III Italica|Legio III ''Italica'']] six times faithful and loyal.\"\nImage:Antoninianus-Gallienus-l5macedonica-RIC 0345-Bj-.jpg|Antoninianus issued to celebrate <small>LEG VII MAC VI P VI F</small>, \"[[Legio V Macedonica|Legio VII ''Macedonica'']] six times faithful and loyal.\"\nFile:Gallienus legio VII Claudia.jpg|Antoninianus issued to celebrate <small>LEG VII CLA VI P VI F</small>, \"[[Legio VII Claudia|Legio VII ''Claudia'']] six times faithful and loyal.\"\n</gallery>\n\n===Decree of Toleration===\nThe capture of Valerian in the year 259 forced Gallienus to issue the first official declaration of tolerance with regard to the Christians, restoring their places of worship and cemeteries, therefore implying a recognition of the property of the Church.

It also doubled as a winter coat for wearers. Gambesons were produced with a sewing technique called [[quilting]]. Usually constructed of [[linen]] or [[wool]], the stuffing varied, and could be for example scrap [[cloth]] or horse hair. During the 14th century, illustrations usually show buttons or laces up the front.\n\nAn '''arming doublet''' (also called '''aketon''') worn under armour, particularly [[plate armour]] of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Europe, contains [[arming point]]s for attaching plates. Fifteenth century examples may include [[gousset]]s sewn into the elbows and armpits to protect the wearer in locations not covered by plate. [[Germany|German]] [[plate armour|gothic armour]] arming doublets were generally shorter than [[Italy|Italian]] [[white armour]] doublets, which could extend to the upper thigh. In late fifteenth century Italy this also became a civilian fashion. Men who were not knights wore arming doublets, probably because the garment suggested status and [[chivalry]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Dirk H. |last=Breiding |title=Fashion in European Armor, 1400\u20131500 |date= |work= |publisher=Department of Arms and Armor, The Metropolitan Museum of Art |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/afas15/hd_afas15.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''gambeson'' is a loan from  Old French ''gambeson'', ''gambaison'', originally ''wambais'', formed after the [[Middle High German]] term ''wambeis'' \"doublet\", in turn from [[Old High German]] ''wamba'' \"stomach\" ([[cognate]] to ''[[womb]]'').<ref>{{cite web |title= Gambeson |work= |publisher=Merriam-Webster |language=English |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gambeson}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''aketon'', originally medieval French ''alcottonem'', might be a loan from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-qutn'' \"[[cotton]] (definite article - ''the'' cotton).\"\n\nIn medieval Norse, the garment was known as ''v\u00e1pntreyja'', literally \"weapon shirt,\" or ''panzari/panzer''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Leiv |last=Heggstad |first2=Finn |last2=H\u00f8dneb\u00f8 |first3=Erik |last3=Simensen |title=Norr\u00f8n Ordbok |publisher=Det norske samlaget |location=Oslo |year=2008 |origyear=1909 |isbn=8252171508 |oclc=768091918 |pages=477, 703\u20134 |url=}}</ref> ''Treyja'' is a loan from (Middle) Low German.

The European gambeson can be traced at least to the late 10th century, but it is likely to have been in use in various forms for longer than that. In Europe, its use became widespread in the 13th century, and peaked in the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nThe gambeson was used both as a complete armour unto itself and underneath mail and plate in order to cushion the body and prevent chafing. It was very insulatory and thus uncomfortable, but its protection was vital for the soldier.\n\nAlthough they are thought to have been used in Europe much earlier, gambesons underwent a revolution from their first proven use in the late 11th and early 12th centuries as an item of armour that simply facilitated the wearing of mail to an item of independent armour popular amongst infantry. Although quilted armour survived into the [[English Civil War]] in [[England]] as a poor man's [[cuirass]], and as an item to be worn beneath the few remaining suits of full plate, it was increasingly replaced by the '[[buff coat]]' \u2013 a leather jacket of rough suede.\n\nThere are two distinctive designs of gambeson; those designed to be worn beneath another armour, and those designed to be worn as independent armour. The latter tend to be thicker and higher in the collar, and faced with other materials, such as leather, or heavy canvas. This variant is usually referred to as ''padded jack'' and made of several (some say around 18,<ref>{{cite book |first=Gerry |last=Embleton |title=Medieval Military Costume: Europa Militaria Special |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_quNwAACAAJ |date=2001 |publisher=Crowood Press UK |isbn=978-1-86126-371-1 |page=67}}</ref> some even 30<ref name=\"Embleton, Gerry p.47\">{{cite book |first=Gerry |last=Embleton |last2=Howe |first2=John |title=S\u00f6ldnerleben im Mittelalter |publisher=Motorbuchverlag |location= |year=1994 |isbn= |page=47 |url=}}</ref>) layers of cotton, linen or wool. These jacks were known to stop even heavy arrows<ref name=\"Embleton, Gerry p.47\"/> and their design of multiple layers bears a striking resemblance to modern day [[body armor]], which substituted at first silk, ballistic nylon and later [[Kevlar]] as fabric.\n\nFor common soldiers who could not afford mail or plate armour, the gambeson, combined with a helmet as the only additional protection, remained a common sight on European battlefields during the entire Middle Ages, and its decline \u2013 paralleling that of plate armour \u2013 came only with the [[Renaissance]], as the use of firearms became more widespread, until by the 18th century it was no longer in military use.\n\nWhile the use of linen has been shown in archaeological evidence, the use of cotton \u2013 and cotton-based canvas \u2013 is disputed since the access to large amounts of cotton cloth was not widely available in northern Europe at this time. It is quite probable that Egypt (and Asia-Minor generally) still produced cotton well after the 7th and 8th centuries and knowledge (and samples) of this cloth was brought to Europe by the returning Crusaders.

[[Kabul]] is the capital and largest city of Afghanistan, located in the [[Kabul Province]]. Strategically located at the crossroads of major trade routes, Afghanistan has attracted a succession of invaders since the sixth century BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |accessdate=February 11, 2012 |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan |location=United States |date=August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408085103/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |archivedate=April 8, 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hindu Kush]] mountains, running northeast to southwest across the country, divide it into three major regions: 1) the Central Highlands, which form part of the [[Himalayas]]{{contradict-inline|article=Himalayas|date=October 2014}} and account for roughly two thirds of the country's area; 2) the Southwestern Plateau, which accounts for one-fourth of the land; and 3) the smaller Northern Plains area, which contains the country's most fertile soil.\n\nLand elevations generally slope from northeast to southwest, following the general shape of the Hindu Kush massif, from its highest point in the [[Pamir Mountains]] near the [[China|Chinese]] border to the lower elevations near the border with [[Uzbekistan]]. To the north, west, and southwest there are no mountain barriers to neighboring countries. The northern plains pass almost imperceptibly into the plains of [[Turkmenistan]]. In the west and southwest, the plateaus and deserts merge into those of Iran. Afghanistan is located on the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian Tectonic Plate]]. The [[Wakhan Corridor]] and the rest of northeastern Afghanistan, including Kabul, are situated in a geologically active area. Over a dozen earthquakes occurred there during the twentieth century.\n\nThe greater part of the northern border and a small section of the border with [[Pakistan]] are marked by rivers; the remaining boundary lines are political rather than natural. The northern frontier extends approximately {{convert|1689|km|abbr=on}} southwestward, from the Pamir Mountains in the northeast to a region of hills and deserts in the west, at the border with Iran. The border with Iran runs generally southward from the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] across swamp and desert regions before reaching the northwestern tip of Pakistan. Its southern section crosses the [[Helmand River]].\n\nAfghanistan is bounded by six different countries. Its longest border is the poorly marked [[Durand Line]], accounting for its entire southern and eastern boundary with Pakistan. The shortest one, bordering China's [[Xinjiang]] province, is a mere {{convert|76|km|abbr=on}} at the end of the Wakhan Corridor (the Afghan Panhandle), a narrow sliver of land {{convert|241|km|abbr=on}} long that extends eastward between [[Tajikistan]] and Pakistan. At its narrowest point it is only {{convert|11|km|0|abbr=on}} wide.\n\nThe border with Pakistan runs eastward from Iran through the [[Chagai Hills]] and the southern end of the [[Registan Desert]], then northward through mountainous country. It then follows an irregular northeasterly course before reaching the Durand Line, established in 1893. This line continues on through mountainous regions to the [[Khyber Pass]] area. Beyond this point it rises to the crest of the Hindu Kush, which it follows eastward to the Pamir Mountains. The Durand Line divides the [[Pashtun tribes]] of the region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Its creation has caused much dissatisfaction among Afghans and has given rise to political tensions between the two countries.\n\n==Climate==\nRainfall in Afghanistan is very scarce, and mainly only affects the northern highlands, arriving in March and April. Rainfall in the more arid lowlands is rare, and can be very unpredictable.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc226769/m2/1/high_res_d/Afghanistan.hires.report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040624/http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc226769/m2/1/high_res_d/Afghanistan.hires.report.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Mountain systems==\n{{Tone|section|date=June 2009}}\nThe [[Hindu Kush]] mountain range reaches a height of {{convert|7492|m|ft|abbr=on}} at [[Noshaq]], Afghanistan's highest peak. Of the ranges extending southwestward from the Hindu Kush, the Foladi peak (''Shah Foladi'') of the Baba mountain range (''[[Koh-i-Baba]]'') reaches the greatest height: {{convert|5142|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Safed Koh]] range, which includes the [[Tora Bora]] area, dominates the border area southeast of [[Kabul]].\n[[File:Black Hawk flying over a valley in Bamyan.jpg|left|thumb|Snow-covered [[Koh-i-Baba]] mountains in [[Bamyan Province]] of [[Afghanistan]]]]\n[[File:Mountains in Afghanistan.JPG|thumb|left|Snow-covered [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in Afghanistan]]\n[[File:Landscape in Paktia Province.jpg|left|thumb|Snow-covered mountains in the [[Paktia Province]].]]\nImportant passes include the [[Unai Pass]] across the Safed Koh, the [[Kushan Pass|Kushan]] and [[Salang Pass|Salang]] Passes through the Hindu Kush, and the [[Khyber Pass]] that connects Afghanistan with Pakistan. The summit of the Khyber Pass at {{convert|1070|m|ft|abbr=on}} at [[Landi Kotal]], Pakistan is 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) east of the border town of [[Torkham]]. Other key passages through the mountainous Pakistan border include two from Paktika Province into Pakistan's [[Waziristan]] region: one at [[Angoor Ada]], a village that straddles both sides of the border east of [[Shkin, Paktika|Shkin]], and, further south, the [[Gumal River]] crossing, plus the [[Charkai River]] passage south of [[Khost]], Afghanistan, at Pakistan's [[Ghulam Khan]] village into [[North Waziristan]]. The busy Pak-Afghan border crossing at Wesh, Afghanistan is in a flat and dry area, though this route involves Pakistan's [[Khojak Pass]] at {{convert|2707|m|ft|abbr=on}} just {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=on}} from the border. The border connects [[Kandahar]] and [[Spin Boldak]] in Afghanistan with [[Quetta]] in Pakistan,\n\nThe [[Wakhan Corridor]] in the northeast lies between the Hindu Kush and the [[Pamir Mountains]], which leads to the [[Wakhjir Pass]] into [[Xinjiang]] in [[China]]. Taking the highlands of the country as a whole, there is no great difference between the mean temperature of Afghanistan and that of the lower [[Himalaya]]. Each may be placed at a point between . However, the remarkable feature of Afghan climate is its extreme range of temperature within limited periods. The smallest daily range in the north is when the weather is cold; the greatest is when it is hot. For seven months of the year (from May to November) this range exceeds {{convert|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} daily. Waves of intense cold occur, lasting for several days, and one may have to endure a cold of {{convert|-24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, rising to a maximum of {{convert|-8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. On the other hand, the summer temperature is exceedingly high, especially in the Oxus regions, where a shade maximum of {{convert|45|-|50|C|F|0}} is not uncommon. At Kabul, and over all the northern part of the country to the descent at [[Gandamak]], winter is rigorous, but especially so on the high Arachosian plateau. In Kabul the snow lies for two or three months; the people seldom leave their houses, and sleep close to stoves. At Ghazni the snow has been known to lie long beyond the vernal equinox; the thermometer sinks as low as {{convert|-25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, and tradition relates the destruction of the entire population of Ghazni by snowstorms more than once.\n[[File:Branches of the Kunar River meet in Nangarhar Province.jpg|thumb|Branches of the [[Kunar River]] meet with the [[Kabul River]] in [[Nangarhar Province]]]]\n[[File:Arghandab River Valley between Kandahar and Lashkar Gah.jpg|thumb|[[Arghandab District|Arghandab district]], between [[Kandahar]] and [[Lashkar Gah]]]]\n\nThe summer heat is great in the [[Sistan Basin]], [[Jalalabad]] and [[Afghan Turkestan|Turkestan]], especially Sistan. All over Kandahar province the summer heat is intense, and the [[simoom]] is not unknown. The hot season throughout this part of the country is rendered more trying by frequent dust storms and fiery winds; whilst the bare rocky ridges that traverse the country, absorbing heat by day and radiating it by night, render the summer nights most oppressive. At Kabul the summer sun has great power, though the heat is tempered occasionally by cool breezes from the [[Hindu Kush]], and the nights are usually cool. At Kandahar snow seldom falls on the plains or lower hills; when it does, it melts at once.\n\nAlthough [[Herat]] is approximately {{convert|240|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} lower than Kandahar, the summer climate there is more temperate, and the climate throughout the year is far from disagreeable. From May to September, the wind blows from the northwest with great force, and this extends across the country to Kandahar. The winter is tolerably mild; snow melts as it falls, and even on the mountains does not lie long. Three years out of four at Herat it does not freeze hard enough for the people to store ice; yet it was not very far from Herat, and could not have been at a greatly higher level (at Rafir Kala, near Kassan) that, in 1750, Ahmad Shah's army, retreating from Persia, is said to have lost 18,000 men from cold in a single night. In the northern Herat districts, too, records of the coldest month (February) show the mean minimum as {{convert|-8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the maximum as {{convert|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The eastern reaches of the Hari River, including the rapids, are frozen hard in the winter, and people travel on it as on a road.\n\nThe summer rains that accompany the southwest monsoon in India, beating along the southern slopes of the Himalaya, travel up the Kabul valley as far as Laghman, though they are more clearly felt in [[Bajour]] and [[Panjkora]], under the high spurs of the [[Hindu Kush]], and in the eastern branches of [[Safed Koh]]. Rain also falls at this season at the head of [[Kurram Valley|Kurram valley]]. South of this the [[Suliman mountains]] may be taken as the western limit of the monsoon's action. It is quite unfelt in the rest of Afghanistan, in which, as in all the west of Asia, the winter rains are the most considerable. The spring rain, though less copious, is more important to agriculture than the winter rain, unless where the latter falls in the form of snow. In the absence of monsoon influences there are steadier weather indications than in India. The north-west blizzards which occur in winter and spring are the most noticeable feature, and their influence is clearly felt on the Indian frontier. The cold is then intense and the force of the wind cyclonic. Speaking generally, the Afghanistan climate is a dry one. The sun shines with splendor for three-fourths of the year, and the nights are even more clear than the days. Marked characteristics are the great differences of summer and winter temperature and of day and night temperature, as well as the extent to which change of climate can be attained by slight change of place. The emperor [[Babur]] observed:\n{{quote|Within a day's ride from Kabul it is possible to reach a place where snow never falls. But within two hours one can go where the snow never melts\u2014except in the rare summer so severe that all snow disappears. Both tropical and cold-weather fruits are abundant in Kabul's dependencies, and they are nearby.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mughal warfare|last=Gommans|first=Jos J.

It loses about two-thirds of its water to neighboring Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.\n\nThe nation's drainage system is essentially landlocked. Most of the rivers and streams end in shallow desert lakes or [[oases]] inside or outside the country's boundaries. Nearly half of the state's total area is drained by watercourses south of the Hindu Kush\u2013Safid ridge line, and half of this area is drained by the [[Helmand River|Helmand]] and its tributaries alone. The [[Amu Darya]] on the northern border, the country's other major river, has the next largest drainage area.\n\nThe {{convert|2661|km|abbr=on}} long [[Amu Darya]] originates in the glaciers of the [[Pamir Mountains]] in the northeast. Some 965&nbsp;km of its upper course constitutes Afghanistan's border with Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Flowing in rapid torrents in its upper course, the Amu Darya becomes calmer below the mouth of the [[Kokcha River|Kokcha]], {{convert|96|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Fayzabad, Badakhshan|Fayzabad]]. The [[Kunduz River]] is another major tributary. During its flood period the upper course of the Amu Darya, swollen by snow and melting ice, carries along much gravel and large boulders.\n\nThe [[Helmand River]] is the principal river in the southwest, bisecting the entire region. Starting some {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Kabul]] in the [[Baba mountain range]], the Helmand is approximately {{convert|1400|km|abbr=on}} long, making it the longest river situated entirely within Afghanistan. With its many tributaries, the most important of which is the [[Arghandab River]], it drains more than {{convert|298|km2|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe [[Kabul River]], {{convert|515|km|abbr=on}} long, is a vital source of water in the Baba Mountains and for Kabul itself, which it flows through. The Kabul and its tributaries are among the few in Afghanistan that eventually reach the sea, as it flows east into the [[Indus River]] in Pakistan.\n\nIn the west the sandy deserts along most of the Iranian frontier have no watercourses. However, in the northwest, the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari]] and [[Murghab River (Afghanistan)|Morghab]] Rivers flow into Turkmenistan's [[Karakum Desert]].\n\n==Vegetation==\n[[File:Almond trees in Zabul Province of Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|[[Almond]] trees in bloom line the valley near the [[Dey Chopan District|Daychopan District]] Center in the [[Zabul Province]]]]\nThe characteristic distribution of vegetation on the mountains of Afghanistan is worthy of attention. The great mass of it is confined to the main ranges and their immediate offshoots, whilst on the more distant and terminal prolongations it is almost entirely absent; in fact, these are naked rock and stone. Take, for example, the Safed Koh. On the alpine range itself and its immediate branches, at a height of {{convert|1800|-|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} there is abundant growth of large forest trees, among which conifers are the most noble and prominent, such as ''[[Cedrus deodara]]'', ''[[Fir|Abies excelsa]]'', ''[[Pinus longifolia]]'', ''[[Pinus pinaster]]'', [[Pinus pinea|Stone pine]] (the edible pine, although this species is probably introduced, since it is original to [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) and the larch. There is also the [[taxus|yew]], the [[hazel]], [[juniper]], [[walnut]], [[peach|wild peach]] and [[almond]]. Growing under the shade of these are several varieties of [[rose]], [[honeysuckle]], [[Ribes|currant]], [[gooseberry]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[rhododendron]] and a luxuriant herbage, among which the ranunculus family is important for frequency and number of genera. The lemon and wild vine are also here met with, but are more common on the northern mountains. The walnut and oak (evergreen, holly-leaved and kermes) descend to the secondary heights, where they become mixed with alder, ash, khinjak, Arbor-vitae, juniper, with species of Astragalus, &c. Here also are Indigoferae rind dwarf laburnum.\n[[File:Stream in Nuristan province.jpg|left|thumb|[[Nuristan Province]]]]\n[[File:Hillside view in Khawajah Bahawuddin, Takhar Province, Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|[[Takhar Province]] in northern Afghanistan]]\n\nDown to {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} there are [[Olea europaea|wild olive]], species of rock-rose, wild privet, acacias and mimosas, barberry and ''[[Zizyphus]]''; and in the eastern ramifications of the chain, ''[[Nannerops ritchiana]]'' (which is applied to a variety of useful purposes), ''[[Bignonia]]'' or trumpet flower, sissu, ''[[Salvadora persica]]'', verbena, acanthus, varieties of Gesnerae.\n\nThe lowest terminal ridges, especially towards the west, are, as it has been said, naked in aspect. Their scanty vegetation is almost wholly herbal; shrubs are only occasional; trees almost non-existent. Labiate, composite and umbelliferous plants are most common. [[Fern]]s and [[moss]]es are almost confined to the higher ranges.\n\nIn the low brushwood scattered over portions of the dreary plains of the Kandahar tablelands, it is possible to find leguminous thorny plants of the papilionaceous suborder, such as camel-thorn (''[[Hedysarum|Hedysarum alhagi]]''), ''[[Astragalus]]'' in several varieties, spiny rest-harrow (''[[Ononis]] spinosa''), the fibrous roots of which often serve as a tooth-brush; plants of the sub-order [[Mimosa]]e, as the sensitive mimosa; a plant of the [[rue family]], called by the natives ''lipad''; the common [[Artemisia (plant)|wormwood]]; also certain [[orchid]]s, and several species of Salsola. The rue and wormwood are in general use as domestic medicines\u2014the former for [[rheumatism]] and [[Neurasthenia|neuralgia]]; the latter in fever, debility and dyspepsia, as well as for a vermifuge. The lipad, owing to its heavy nauseous odour, is believed to keep off evil spirits.

Grand juries perform both accusatory and investigatory functions. The investigatory functions of grand juries include obtaining and reviewing documents and other evidence, and hearing sworn testimonies of witnesses who appear before it; the accusatory function determines whether there is [[probable cause]] to believe that one or more persons committed a certain offence within the venue of a district court.\n\nA grand jury in the United States is usually composed of 16 to 23 citizens, though in Virginia it has fewer members for regular or special grand juries. In [[Ireland]], they also functioned as local government authorities. In Japan, the Law of July 12, 1948 created the ''Kensatsu Shinsakai'' (Prosecutorial Review Commission or PRC system), inspired by the American system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1699&context=cilj|title=e Rebirth of Japan\u2019s Petit Quasi-Jury and Grand Jury Systems: A Cross-National Analysis of Legal Consciousness and the Lay Participatory Experience in Japan and the U.S.|last=Fukurai|first=Hiroshi|date=August 4, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe grand jury is so named because traditionally it has more jurors than a trial [[jury]], sometimes called a [[petit jury]] (from the French word ''petit'' meaning \"small\").<ref name=\"LawDict\">A Law Dictionary by Henry Campbell Black 2nd ed , publ. by West, St Paul, Minnesota,1910. Entry for Grand Jury</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}\nThe function of a grand jury is to accuse persons who may be guilty of an offense, but the institution is also a shield against unfounded and oppressive prosecution. It is a means for lay citizens, representative of the community, to participate in the administration of justice. It can also make presentments on crime and maladministration in its area. The traditional number of the grand jury is 23.\n\nThe mode of accusation is by a written statement in solemn form (indictment) describing the offense with proper accompaniments of time and circumstances, and certainty of act and person or by a mode less formal, which is usually the spontaneous act of the grand jury, called presentment.<ref name=Blackstone1>Commentaries on the Laws of England, by William Blackstone, Book 4,  Ch.23   (p. 586 in 1840 ed. of John Bethune Bayly)</ref> No indictment or presentment can be made except by concurrence of at least twelve of the jurors. The grand jury may accuse upon their own knowledge, but it is generally done upon the testimony of witnesses under oath and other evidence heard before them. The proceedings of grand jury are, in the first instance, at the instigation of the government or other prosecutor, and ex parte and in secret deliberation. The accused has no knowledge nor right to interfere with their proceedings.<ref name=britcyclop>British Cyclopedia of Literature, History,Geography, Law and Politics, publ. by Orr and Smith, London, 1836,  Vol 2, p.591</ref>\n\nIf they find the accusation true, which is usually drawn up in form by the prosecutor or an officer of the court, they write upon the indictment the words \"a true bill\" which is signed by the foreman of the grand jury and presented to the court publicly in the presence of all the jurors. If the indictment is not proven to the satisfaction of the grand jury, the word [[Wiktionary:ignoramus|\"ignoramus\"]] <ref>In [[Latin language|Latin]], \"ignoramus\" literally means \u201cwe are ignorant of\u201d or \u201cwe do not know\u201d - in the context of a Grand Jury it effectively means \u201cwe do not know of any reason why this person should be indicted on these charges\u201d. This use of \"ignoramus\" long predates its more common English meaning of an ignorant person or dunce.</ref> or \"not a true bill\" is written upon it by the grand jury, or by their foreman and then said to be ignored, and the accusation is dismissed as unfounded.  (The potential defendant is said to have been \"no-billed\" by the grand jury.)  If the grand jury returns an indictment as a true bill (\"billa vera\"), the indictment is said to be founded and the party to stand indicted and required to be put on trial.<ref name=harris1>The Criminal Law. by Seymour F. Harris, 7th ed., publ. Stevens & Haynes, London, 1896. Book 3, Ch 7  Grand Jury (4th para)</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n\nThe first instance of a grand jury can be traced back to the [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166, an Act of [[Henry II of England]].<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aclarendon.html Medieval Sourcebook: Assize of Clarendon 1166]</ref> Henry's chief impact on the development of the English monarchy was to increase the jurisdiction of the royal courts at the expense of the feudal courts. Itinerant justices on regular circuits were sent out once each year to enforce the \"King's Peace\". To make this system of royal criminal justice more effective, Henry employed the method of [[inquest]] used by [[William the Conqueror]] in the [[Domesday Book]]. In each shire, a body of important men was sworn (''jur\u00e9'') to report to the [[sheriff]] all crimes committed since the last session of the circuit court. Thus originated the more recent grand jury that presents information for an indictment.<ref>[http://www.history-world.org/midbritain.htm The Making of Modern Britain]</ref> The grand jury was later recognized by [[John of England|King John]] in [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 on demand of the nobility.<ref>[http://www.dcdave.com/article5/070119.htm Turley, Hugh: \"The Grand Jury\"], Hyattsville Life & Times, 2007</ref>\n\nThe Grand Jury can be said to have \"celebrated\" its 800th birthday in 2015, because a precursor to the Grand Jury is defined in Article 61, the longest of the 63 articles of [[Magna Carta]], also called ''Magna Carta Libertatum'' (Latin: \"the Great Charter of Liberties\") executed on 15 June 1215 by King John and by the Barons. The document was primarily composed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Stephen Langton]] (1150-1228). He and Cardinal [[Hugo de Sancto Caro]] developed schemas for division of the Bible into chapters and it is the system of Archbishop Langton which prevailed.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07175a.htm Hebrew Bible] article in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.</ref><ref name=Moore>Moore, G.F.

He immediately petitioned the [[Old Bailey]] on a writ of [[habeas corpus]], but the Old Bailey said it did not have jurisdiction over prisoners in the Tower of London, so Cooper had to wait for the next session of the [[Court of King's Bench]]. Cooper moved for a writ of habeas corpus on 24 October 1681, and his case finally came before a grand jury on 24 November 1681.\n\nThe government's case against Cooper was particularly weak \u2013 the government admitted that most of the witnesses brought against Cooper had already perjured themselves, and the documentary evidence was inconclusive; and the jury was handpicked by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] Sheriff of London. For these reasons the government had little chance of securing a conviction, and on 13 February 1682 the case was dropped when the Grand Jury issued an ''ignoramus'' bill, rather than comply with the King's intent of a \"True Bill\", known as a Grand Jury Indictment.\n\nThe grand jury's theoretical function against abuse of [[executive (government)|executive]] power was seen during the [[Watergate]] crisis in America, in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 8 to 0 on 23 July 1974 (Justice [[William Rehnquist]] who had been appointed by [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] recused himself from the case) that [[executive privilege]] applied only to the co-equal branches, the legislative and judicial, not to grand jury subpoenas, thus implying a grand jury constituted protections equaled to a \"fourth branch of government\". The second Watergate grand jury indicted seven lawyers in the White House, including former Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] and named President Nixon as a \"secret, un-indicted, co-conspirator.\" Despite evading [[impeachment]], Nixon was still required to testify before a grand jury.\n\nSimilarly, in 1998, [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] became the first sitting president required to testify before a grand jury as subject of an investigation by the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Office of Independent Counsel]]. The testimony came after a four-year investigation into Clinton and his wife Hillary's alleged involvement in several scandals including Whitewater and the Rose Law Firm.  Revelations from the investigation sparked a battle in Congress over whether or not to impeach Clinton.<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-testifies-before-grand-jury \"This Day in History, 1998:  Clinton Testifies before Grand Jury\"] (August 21, 2018).  ''History.com''.  Retrieved September 23, 2018.</ref>\n\n==By jurisdiction==\n\n===England and Wales===\nThe sheriff of every county was required to return to every [[quarter session]]s and [[assizes]] (or more precisely the commission of ''[[oyer and terminer]]'' and of gaol delivery), 24 men of the county \"to inquire into, present, do and execute all those things which, on the part of our Lord the King (''or'' our Lady the Queen), shall then be commanded them\". Grand jurors at the assizes or at the borough quarter sessions did not have property qualifications; but, at the county quarter sessions, they had the same property qualification as petty jurors. However, at the assizes, the grand jury generally consisted of gentlemen of high standing in the county.\n\nAfter the court was opened by the crier making proclamation, the names of those summoned to the grand jury were called and they were sworn. They numbered at least 14 and not more than 23. The person presiding (the judge at the assizes, the chairman at the county sessions, the recorder at the borough sessions) gave the charge to the grand jury, i.e. he directed their attention to points in the various cases about to be considered which required explanation.\n\nThe charge having been delivered, the grand jury withdrew to their own room, having received the bills of [[indictment]]. The witnesses whose names were endorsed on each bill were sworn as they came to be examined, in the grand jury room, the oath being administered by the foreman, who wrote his initials against the name of the witness on the back of the bill. Only the witnesses for the prosecution were examined, as the function of the grand jury was merely to inquire whether there was sufficient ground to put the accused on trial. If the majority of them (and at least 12) thought that the evidence so adduced made out a sufficient case, the words \"a true bill\" were endorsed on the back of the bill. If they were of the opposite opinion, the phrase \"not a true bill\", or the single Latin word [[Wiktionary:ignoramus|''ignoramus'']] (\"we do not know\" or \"we are ignorant (of)\"), was endorsed instead and the bill was said to be \"ignored\" or thrown out. They could find a true bill as to the charge in one count, and ignore that in another; or as to one defendant and not as to another; but they could not, like a petty jury, return a special or conditional finding, or select part of a count as true and reject the other part. When some bills were \"found\", some of the jurors came out and handed the bills to the clerk of arraigns (in assizes) or [[clerk of the peace]], who announced to the court the name of the prisoner, the charge, and the endorsements of the grand jury. They then retired and considered other bills until all were disposed of; after which they were discharged by the judge, chairman, or recorder.\n\nIf a bill was thrown out, although it could not again be preferred to the grand jury during the same assizes or sessions, it could be preferred at subsequent assizes or sessions, but not in respect of the same offence if a petty jury had returned a verdict.\n\nOrdinarily, bills of indictment were preferred after there had been an examination before the [[Magistrates of England and Wales|magistrates]]. But this need not always take place. With certain exceptions, any person could prefer a bill of indictment against another before the grand jury without any previous inquiry into the truth of the accusation before a magistrate. This right was at one time universal and was often abused. A substantial check was put on this abuse by the [[Vexatious Indictments Act 1859]].<ref>22 & 23 Vict. c. 17, s. l.</ref> This Act provided that for certain offences which it listed (perjury, libel, etc.), the person presenting such an indictment must be bound by recognizance to prosecute or give evidence against the accused, or alternatively had judicial permission (as specified) so to do.\n\nIf an indictment was found in the absence of the accused, and he/she was not in custody and had not been bound over to appear at assizes or sessions, then process was issued to bring that person into court, as it is contrary to the English law to \"try\" an indictment in the absence of the accused.\n\nThe grand jury's functions were gradually made redundant by the development of [[committal procedure|committal proceedings]] in magistrates' courts from 1848 onward when the (three) [[John Jervis (politician)|Jervis]] Acts,<ref>See Indictable Offences Act 1848 (11 and 12 Vict c. 42); title: An Act to facilitate the Performance of the Duties of Justices of the Peace out of Sessions within England and Wales with respect to Persons charged with indictable Offences</ref> such as the [[Justices Protection Act 1848]], codified and greatly expanded the functions of magistrates in pre-trial proceedings; these proceedings developed into almost a repeat of the trial itself. In 1933 the grand jury ceased to function in England, under the [[Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933]]<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/23-24/36/contents legislation.gov.uk: \"Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933\" (23 & 24 Geo 5 c 36)]</ref> and was entirely abolished in 1948, when a clause from 1933 saving grand juries for offences relating to officials abroad was repealed by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]].\n\n===Scotland===\n\nThe grand jury was introduced in [[Scotland]], solely for [[high treason]], a year after the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] with [[England]], by the [[Treason Act 1708]], an [[Act of Parliament|Act of the Parliament]] of [[Great Britain]]. Section III of the Act required the Scottish courts to try cases of treason and [[misprision of treason]] according to English rules of procedure and evidence.<ref>Treason Act, 1708 (7 Ann c 21)</ref> This rule was repealed in 1945.<ref>Treason Act 1945 (c. 44), section 2(2) and Schedule.</ref>\n\nThe first Scottish grand jury under this Act met at Edinburgh on 10 October 1748 to take cognisance of the charges against such rebels as had not surrendered, following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]].\n\nAn account of its first use in Scotland illustrates the institution's characteristics. It consisted of 23 good and lawful men, chosen out of 48 who were summoned: 24 from the county of [[Edinburgh]] ([[Midlothian]]), 12 from [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] ([[East Lothian]]) and 12 from [[Linlithgow]] ([[West Lothian]]). The court consisted of three judges from the [[High Court of Justiciary]] (Scotland's highest criminal court), of whom [[Charles Erskine, Lord Tinwald|Tinwald]] ([[Lord Justice Clerk|Justice Clerk]]) was elected  ''preses'' (presiding member). [[Subpoena]]s under the seal of the court and signed by the clerk were executed on a great number of persons in different shires, requiring them to appear as witnesses under the penalty of \u00a3100 each. The ''preses'' named Sir John Inglis of [[Cramond]] as Foreman of the Grand Jury, who was sworn first in the English manner by kissing the book; the others followed three at a time; after which Lord Tinwald, addressing the jurors, informed them that the power [[Lord Advocate|His Majesty's advocate]] possessed before the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]], of prosecuting any person for high treason, who appeared guilty on a precognition taken of the facts, being now done away, power was lodged with them, a grand jury, 12 of whom behoved to concur before a true bill could be found. An indictment was then preferred in court and the witnesses endorsed on it were called over and sworn; on which the jury retired to the exchequer chambers and the witnesses were conducted to a room near it, whence they were called to be examined separately. Two solicitors for the crown were present at the examination but no-one else; and after they had finished and the sense of the jury was collected, the indictment was returned a \"[[true bill]]\", if the charges were found proved, or \"[[wikt:ignoramus|ignoramus]]\" if doubtful. The proceedings continued for a week, in which time, out of 55 bills, 42 were sustained and 13 dismissed.<ref>The  \"History of Scotland, With Notes, and a Continuation to the Present Time\", by George Buchanan (up to 16th Century) and James Aikman, Edinburgh 1829. See Vol. 6,p.486</ref>\n\nFurther Acts of Parliament in the 19th century regarding treason did not specify this special procedure and the Grand Jury was used no longer.\n\n===Ireland===\nIn [[Ireland]], grand juries were active from the [[Middle Ages]] during the [[Lordship of Ireland]] in parts of the island under the control of the English government ([[The Pale]]), that was followed by the [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. They mainly functioned as local government authorities at the [[Counties of Ireland|county]] level. The system was so-called as the grand jurors had to present their [[public works]] proposals and budgets in court for official sanction by a [[judge]]. Grand jurors were usually the largest local payers of [[Rates (tax)|rates]], and therefore tended to be the larger [[landlord]]s, and on retiring they selected new members from the same background.\n\nDistinct from their public works function, as property owners they also were qualified to sit on criminal juries hearing [[Jury trial|trials by jury]], as well as having a pre-trial judicial function for serious criminal cases. Many of them also sat as [[Justice of the peace|magistrates]] judging the less serious cases.\n\nThey were usually wealthy \"country gentlemen\" (i.e. landowners, [[landed gentry]], farmers and merchants):\n{{quote|A country gentleman as a member of a Grand Jury...levied the local taxes, appointed the nephews of his old friends to collect them, and spent them when they were gathered in.

During that period counties followed the traditional practice of requiring all decisions be made by at least 12 of the grand jurors, (e.g., for a 23-person grand jury, 12 people would constitute a bare majority). Any citizen could bring a matter before a grand jury directly, from a public work that needed repair, to the delinquent conduct of a public official, to a complaint of a crime, and grand juries could conduct their own investigations.\n\nIn that era most criminal prosecutions were conducted by private parties, either a law enforcement officer, a lawyer hired by a crime victim or his family, or even by laymen. A layman could bring a bill of indictment to the grand jury; if the grand jury found there was sufficient evidence for a trial, that the act was a crime under law, and that the court had jurisdiction, it would return the indictment to the complainant. The grand jury would then appoint the complaining party to exercise the authority{{clarify|date=February 2016}} of an attorney general, that is, one having a [[private attorney general|general power of attorney]] to represent the state in the case.\n\nThe grand jury served to screen out incompetent or malicious prosecutions.<ref name=gje>{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=George John|title=The Grand Jury: Considered from an Historical, Political and Legal Standpoint, and the Law and Practice Relating Thereto|year=1906|publisher=G.T.

The institution of British civil government in 1749 at [[Nova Scotia]] brought the judicature system peculiar to that form, and the grand jury was inherent to it.  A similar form derived in Quebec from the promise of the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] that a faithful copy of '''Laws of England''' would be instituted in the North American possessions of the Crown.<ref>[http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/PreConfederation/rp_1763.html Royal Proclamation of 1763]</ref> Archival records are found that document the presentments of a grand jury in Quebec as early as 16 October 1764.

In point of fact, the second law passed in Upper Canada relates to (petit) jury trial.

Parker, London 1852. Page 348.</ref>\n\nThe jury law of 1791 created an eight-man ''jury d'accusation'' in each ''[[arrondissements of France|arrondissement]]'' (a subdivision of the ''departement'') and a 12-man ''jury de jugement'' in each ''[[Departments of France|departement]]''. In each ''arrondissement'' the ''procureur-syndic'' drew up a list of 30 jurors from the electoral roll every three months for the ''jury d'accusation''. There was no public prosecutor or ''[[juge d'instruction]]''. Instead the police or private citizens could bring a complaint to the [[Justice of the Peace]] established in each [[Cantons of France|canton]] (a subdivision of the arrondissement). This magistrate interrogated the accused to determine whether grounds for prosecution existed and if so sent the case to the ''directeur du jury'' (the director of the ''jury d'accusation''), who was one of the ''arrondissement's'' civil court judges, and who served in the post for six months on a rotating basis. He decided whether to dismiss the charges or, if not, whether the case was a ''[[delict|d\u00e9lit]]'' ([[misdemeanour]]) or a crime ([[felony]], i.e. imprisonable for 2 years or more). ''D\u00e9lits'' went to the ''tribunal de police correctionnelle'' of the ''arrondissement'', while for ''crimes'' the ''directeur de jury'' convoked the ''jury d'accusation'' of the ''arrondissement'', in order to get an [[indictment]]. The ''directeur du jury'' drew up the [[bill of indictment]] (''acte d'accusation'') summarising the charges to be presented to the ''jury d'accusation''. The ''directeur'' made a presentation to the jury in the absence of the accused and the jury heard the witnesses. The jury then decided by majority vote whether there were sufficient grounds for the case to go to the ''tribunal criminel'' of the ''departement''.

Countries with a strong [[gun culture]] may afford civilians a [[right to keep and bear arms]], and have more-liberal gun laws than neighboring jurisdictions. Countries which regulate access to firearms will typically restrict access to certain categories of firearms and then restrict the categories of persons who may be granted a [[firearms license|license]] for access to such firearms. There may be separate licenses for [[hunting]], [[Shooting sport|sport shooting]] ({{a.k.a.}} target shooting), [[self-defense]], collecting, and [[concealed carry]], with different sets of requirements, permissions, and responsibilities.\n\nGun laws are often enacted with the intention of reducing the use of small arms in criminal activity, specifying weapons perceived as being capable of inflicting the greatest damage and those most-easily concealed (such as [[handgun]]s and other short-barreled weapons).  Persons restricted from legal access to firearms may include those below a certain age or having a criminal record. Firearm licenses may be denied to those felt most at risk of harming themselves or others, such as persons with a history of [[domestic violence]], alcoholism or substance abuse, mental illness, depression or attempted suicide. Those applying for a firearm license may have to demonstrate competence by completing a [[Gun safety|gun-safety]] course and show provision for a [[gun safe|secure location]] to store weapons.\n\nGuns laws are considered permissive in countries where the authorities will provide a firearm license on a shall issue basis to ordinary citizens who meet the legal requirements.  Guns laws are restrictive when licenses are provided on a [[may issue]] basis, at the discretion of the regulating authority, often requiring the applicant to demonstrate a reason why they need a firearm.  Gun laws are considered strict when it is difficult or impossible for an ordinary citizen to obtain a firearm through legal means.\n\nThe legislation which restricts small arms may also restrict other weapons, such as explosives, crossbows, swords, [[electroshock weapon]]s, air guns, and pepper spray. It may also restrict firearm accessories, notably [[high-capacity magazine]]s and [[Suppressor|sound suppressors]].  There may be restrictions on the quantity or types of [[ammunition]] purchased, with certain types prohibited. Due to the global scope of this article, detailed coverage cannot be provided on all these matters; the article will instead attempt to briefly summarize each country's weapon laws in regard to small arms use and ownership by civilians.\n\n==Africa==\nThe [[Bamako Convention|Bamako Declaration on an African Common Position on the Illicit Proliferation, Circulation and Trafficking of Small Arms and Light Weapons]] was adopted in [[Bamako, Mali]], on 1 December 2000 by the representatives of the 51 member states of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU).<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Juma|editor-first=Monica Kathina|title=Compendium of Key Documents Relating to Peace and Security in Africa|series=Series on peace and conflict in Africa|year=2006|publisher=Pretoria University Law Press|location=Pretoria|isbn=9780958509732|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjtcCyGjm1wC&dq|page=39|ref={{harvid|Juma|2006}}}}</ref> The provisions of this declaration recommend that the signatories would establish the illegal possession of small arms and light weapons as a criminal offence under national law in their respective countries.<ref>{{cite book| last = Parker | first = Sarah | chapter = Balancing Acts: Regulation of Civilian Firearm Possession | title = Small Arms Survey 2011: States of Security |editor1-first = Eric G. | editor1-last = Berman | editor2-first = Keith | editor2-last = Krause | editor3-first = Emile | editor3-last = LeBrun|editor4-first = Glenn | editor4-last = McDonald | display-editors = 1 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2011 | location = Cambridge | isbn = 9780521146869 | chapterurl = http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2011/en/Small-Arms-Survey-2011-Chapter-09-EN.pdf | url = http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/publications/by-type/yearbook/small-arms-survey-2011.html|page=4 | ref = {{harvid|Parker|2011}}}}</ref>\n\n===Kenya===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}\nGun law in [[Kenya]] is specified in the Firearms Act (Cap. 114) Laws of Kenya.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kenyalaw.org/lex/actview.xql?actid=CAP.%20114|title=CAP. 114|website=kenyalaw.org|access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref> The Chief Licensing Officer (CLO) has discretion to award, deny, or revoke firearms licenses. Applicants must be 21 years of age or older, pass a stringent background check for criminal activity, mental health and domestic violence, and state genuine reason(s) for their need to privately own and carry a firearm. Checks are regularly repeated, with failure to pass resulting in immediate revocation of the license. Once licensed to own a gun, no additional permit is required to carry a concealed firearm.\n\n===South Africa===\n{{Main|Firearm legislation in South Africa}}\n\nTo apply for a firearm license in South Africa applicants must pass a competency test covering the specific type of firearm you are applying a license for and a test on the South African firearm laws. Once these tests are passed you need to apply for a competency certificate, where the South African Police Service will perform a background check and an inspection of the premises where the firearm will be stored. After both the tests are passed and the certificates are awarded you can apply for a firearm license in the categories ranging from self-defence to professional hunting. Different license categories have different restrictions, for example the amount of ammunition that the owner may hold.<ref>https://www.saps.gov.za/services/flash/firearms/faq_categories.php</ref>\n\n==Americas==\n\n===Argentina===\nFirearms in [[Argentina]] are restricted, and regulated by ANMaC (Agencia Nacional de Materiales Controlados) since late October, 2015 when said agency replaced RENAR (Registro Nacional de Armas de la Republica Argentina), both being a branch of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. To own a firearm in Argentina, one must be a legitimate user. Applicants must: be 21 years of age or older, provide a medical certificate that certifies they are physically and mentally fit, complete a safety course, provide a legitimate means of income, undergo and pass a background check. A successful applicant is fingerprinted and issued a license which has to be renewed every five years. One may not legally fire a firearm in Argentina if they are not a legitimate user, even if that gun belongs to someone else. Once a legitimate user wants to purchase a firearm, they must provide a secure location to store the firearm(s), and give an acceptable reason for wanting a firearm \u2013 such as collecting, target shooting, hunting, business, or self-defense in the home.<ref>{{cite web|title=ANMaC|url=http://www.jus.gob.ar/tramites-y-servicios/armas/credencial-de-legitimo-usuario.aspx|website=ANMaC|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nFirearms must be purchased through a licensed dealer and registered with ANMaC. If a firearm is inherited, a re-registering form must be filed. There is no limit on the number of firearms owned so long as they are properly stored. Ammunition sales are recorded but unlimited.<ref name=Explainer/>\n\nCarry permits for licensed handgun owners are extremely difficult to obtain, and require appearing before the ANMaC board to make their case. Carry permits are renewed yearly to re-examine their \"clear and present\" danger, and the permit is usually revoked immediately if this danger is removed. Those dealing in money or valuables or in private security may be issued a business carry permit.<ref>{{cite web|title=ANMaC permits|url=https://www.renar.gov.ar/index_seccion.php?seccion=requisitos&idt=PORTA&m=1&id=2&secc=usuario_tramites|website=ANMaC}}</ref>\n\nHandguns above .32 calibre are conditional-use; fully automatic handguns are prohibited to civilians.

Non-citizens may obtain a non-resident firearms declaration from a customs officer, for a temporary 60-day authorization to bring a non-prohibited firearm into Canada.<ref name=\"RCMP\"/>\n\nIn Canada, firearms fall into one of three categories:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/rp-eng.htm |title=List of Non-Restricted, Restricted, and Prohibited Firearms |author=RCMP |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=22 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211000641/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/rp-eng.htm |archivedate=11 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n# Non-Restricted: Long guns with an overall length greater than {{convert|26|in}} and semi-automatics with a barrel longer than {{convert|18.5|in}}. These can be possessed with an ordinary PAL, and are the only class of firearms which can be used for hunting.\n# Restricted: This includes handguns with barrel lengths greater than 4.1&nbsp;inches (105&nbsp;mm), and long guns which do not meet the length requirements for non-restricted but are not prohibited. These guns require ATTs, so can only be discharged at ranges.\n# Prohibited: These weapons generally cannot be possessed by civilians, and include fully automatic weapons and many military arms, and handguns with barrel length equal to or shorter than 4.1&nbsp;inches (105&nbsp;mm), and those chambered for [[.25 ACP|.25]] and [[.32 ACP|.32]] cartridges. Normally, the only way to possess these is by being grandfathered in or through inheritance. Most magazines for semi-automatic long guns capable of holding more than 5 centerfire cartridges or 10 rounds for handguns are prohibited.\n\n===Chile===\nIn [[Chile]], the 92nd article of the Constitution declares gun ownership as a privilege granted in accordance to a special law. Firearms are regulated by the police. Civilian gun ownership is allowed by law but discouraged by authorities, with regular press statements and campaigns denouncing the dangers of private firearms.\n\nPolice-issued firearm permits require applicants to be 18 years of age, provide a mental health certificate issued by a psychiatrist, have a clean criminal record with no domestic violence accusations, and pass a written test on firearm safety and knowledge. Final approval is in the hands of the police commander of the district, who can deny the permit in \"justified cases\" not detailed in the letter of the law. There are five types of permits:\n* A defense permit allows ownership of 2 firearms which must remain at the declared address.\n* A hunting permit requires a hunting license, and allows for up to 6 firearms.\n* A sporting permit requires membership in a registered gun club, and allows up to 6 firearms. It is possible for those under 18 years of age to obtain this permit.\n* A collection permit allows an unlimited number of firearms to be owned, but does not allow the holder to possess ammunition. Collectors must have special security measures which are reviewed by police.\n\nEach of these has limits on type of firearm, and allows for a police-issued permit to buy a specified quantity of appropriate ammunition from a specific gun shop. Transport permits are required to take firearms from the permit-holder's residence to a specified shooting range or hunting ground, and are valid for two years. Transported firearms must be unloaded and not attached to the body.\n\nA self-defense permit allows carrying a firearm for protection against specific human threats. Such permits are valid for one year, but as the police commander can deny applications without stating a reason, they are very rarely issued. Automatic firearms are forbidden for civilian use.\n\n===Honduras===\n{{Main|Gun laws in Honduras}}\nGun laws in Honduras are stated in the Act on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Material of 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juntec.org.hn/Documentos/Civiles/LEY%20DE%20CONTROL%20DE%20ARMAS%20DE%20FUEGO,%20MUNICIONES%20EXPLOSIVOS%20Y%20SI.pdf|title=Act on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Material|author=Honduras National Congress|publisher=Junta T\u00e9cnica de Normas de Contabilidad y Auditoria|date=October 2004|format=PDF|accessdate=21 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325230511/http://www.juntec.org.hn/Documentos/Civiles/LEY%20DE%20CONTROL%20DE%20ARMAS%20DE%20FUEGO,%20MUNICIONES%20EXPLOSIVOS%20Y%20SI.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nIn April 2002, the National Arms Registry was formed, requiring all citizens to register their firearms with the Ministry of Defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/4619|title=National Arms Registry|author=Honduras National Congress|publisher=GunPolicy.org|date=28 April 2004|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, a ban on certain assault rifles was passed, restricting citizens from possessing military-style rifles such as the AK-47 and the M-16.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/juris/Leyes/DECRETO%20101-2003%20ARMAS%20DE%20FUEGO.pdf |title=DECRETO No. 101-2003|author=Honduras National Congress|publisher=Centro Electr\u00f3nico de Documentaci\u00f3n e Informaci\u00f3n Judicial|date=28 August 2003 |format= PDF |accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\nIn 2007, an additional decree suspended the right to openly carry a firearm in public, and limited the number of firearms possessed per person.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/juris/Decretos/Decreto%2069%202007%20reforma%20a%20la%20ley%20de%20Control%20de%20Armas%20de%20Fuego,%20Municiones,%20Explosivos%20y%20otros%20similares.pdf |format= PDF |title=DECRETO No. 69-2007|author=Honduras National Congress|publisher=Poder Judicial de Honduras|date=29 August 2007|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Jamaica===\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}\nGun laws in Jamaica are stated in the [[Firearms Act (Jamaica)|Firearms Act]] and regulated by the Firearms Licensing Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firearmlicensingauthority.com|title=Firearm Licensing Authority|work=firearmlicensingauthority.com}}</ref>\nApplicants must pass a police background check and complete a certification process to obtain a firearms license for shotguns, handguns and rifles.

Break-action and repeating rifles and break-action shotguns can be purchased without restriction. Semi-automatic rifles and shotguns (non-pump action) require a firearm license or a concealed-carry permit, and must be stored securely. Fully automatic weapons, some military-style semi-automatic rifles, pump-action shotguns, and shotguns with barrels shorter than {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} or {{convert|90|cm|abbr=on}} overall are restricted, with licenses rarely issued.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAntique weapons made before 1871 require no license or registration.

Private citizens are completely forbidden from owning handguns and rifles in any calibre, including .22 rimfire.  Shotguns limited to two rounds are allowed with a license, issued by provincial police. Shotguns must be for hunting purposes, and a licensed citizen may own up to ten shotguns, typically double-barrelled. A firearm license is required to buy ammunition, of up to 250 shells per purchase, with sales recorded.  Cyprus also controls airguns, and airgun owners require a license.<ref name=\"Grupp, Larry 2011\">Grupp, Larry (2011). The Worldwide Gun Owner's Guide. Scottsdale, Arizona: Bloomfield Press, 365pp.</ref>\n\n====Czech Republic====\n{{Main|Gun laws in the Czech Republic}}\nThe Czech Republic is unusual in that the vast majority of gun owners (240,000 out of 300,000) possess their firearms for purposes of self-defense. Furthermore, Czech Republic has a [[shall-issue]] [[concealed carry]] permit system, whereby every self-defense license holder may carry up to two concealed firearms ready for immediate self-defense. This gives Czech Republic a higher rate of concealed carry weapons per capita than the US (by 2010 data) despite much lower gun-ownership rates.\n\nGun licenses may be obtained by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Though general firearms ownership rate remains relatively low, the ability to possess and carry firearms in general is a basic freedom. This is illustrated by the Czech Republic's historical experience of firearm bans under Nazi and Communist dictatorships.\n\nCrime with legally owned firearms is rare, with 45 recorded incidents in 2016, 17 of which were \"dangerous threats\" (compared to the total number of over 800,000 legally possessed firearms). Gun laws had not been an issue until the EU Directive (see [[#European Union|above]]), which led to the proposal of securing Czech citizens' gun rights through adoption of a constitutional amendment that would make firearms possession in the country a national security issue, thus taking it outside the scope of EU law. However, this provision was not approved by the Senate of the Czech Parliament, and therefore didn't become law, as constitutional laws need to be approved by senate in order to pass.\n\n====Denmark====\nCivilians in [[Denmark]] aged 16 and above can acquire gun licenses for hunting or sport shooting. This requires passing a written multiple-choice test and a practical test, after which a certified hunting license instructor determines if the applicant is suitable to own a weapon. A license is usually provided if the applicant has no or only minor marks on their criminal record.\n\nA hunting license permits the over-the-counter-purchase and ownership of an unlimited number of shotguns of up to 12 gauge and 2-round capacity. From there, the police has to be notified of your new weapon purchase through an online form. Bolt-action rifles can also be bought over-the-counter, although they require a rifle license which is purchased through the police. The allowed calibers range from the smallest possible, all the way to .50 BMG, with .50 BMG not included. Semi-automatic rifles are allowed if the rifle is limited to 2 rounds (hunting in Denmark), or without limitation on capacity (hunting outside of Denmark). Currently, only larger calibres (.308, 6,5x55, .300wm etc.) are issued as semi-auto rifles for hunting abroad. .223/5.56x45 and similar caliber rifles are generally not approved.\nThe hunter must pass a shotgun or rifle shooting test before being allowed to hunt.\n\nFor sport-shooting purposes, shotguns can be used as well, as can bolt-action rifles of almost any caliber (.50bmg as one of the exceptions). Sporting rifles are often chambered in 22lr and 6.5 x 55&nbsp;mm.\nSemi-automatic rifles are not allowed for sports shooting.\n\nHandgun: After two years of active membership in a shooting club, one can apply for a handgun permit which is then subject for background check and approval by the police, and one has to be 20 years old.\nApproved calibers:  All calibers under 9mm (9x19, 38 Spl, 357 magnum, .32acp etc.), plus a limited number of larger calibers; .40sw, 45 ACP, 44 Spl.\nThe max number of handguns are 6 in 22 cal.\nWhen applying for gun number 3 it requires a special permit from the department of justice. Large caliber guns, bigger than 22 cal, are restricted to a maximum of 2 in the same caliber. Meaning one can only at a given time own 2 handguns in 9&nbsp;mm. However, it is at the same time legal to own additional 2 handguns in 9&nbsp;mm, if they are revolvers.\nFor all handguns, regardless of caliber, the overall length must be at least 210 millimeters (8.2677 inch), measured without orthopedic grip and removal parts.\n\nA weapon permit for sporting purposes (both long and short firearms) has to be renewed every 5 years. Rifle permits for hunting rifles has to be renewed every 10 years. Shotguns are not on individual permits, and holders are allowed to own these as long as they have a valid hunting license \u2013 and they can keep them for up to 10 years after the hunting license expires \u2013 however they are not allowed to keep ammunition without a valid license.\n\nCarrying a firearm in public is strictly prohibited, however, proportional self-defense is allowed. This means, that if someone is attacked with a firearm, they are legally allowed to defend yourself proportionally \u2013 e.g., with a firearm of their own.\n\nFully automatic weapons are prohibited for civilian use, unless a special permit is issued by the Ministry of Justice. These permits are extremely rare, and are normally only issued to people or companies working for, or supplying the Police or Military.\n\nIllegal possession of a firearm may be punished with imprisonment of no less than one year. Civilians may keep privately owned weapons, including pistols, revolvers, shotguns and rifles at their residence.<ref>https://www.politi.dk/da/borgerservice/vaabentilladelse/blankvaaben.htm</ref> These and ammunition have to be stored in an approved gun cabinet (EN1143-1 grade 0 or better).<ref>https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=158805  \u00a722</ref> The police may inspect a shooting club's weapons at their discretion, but require a court order to inspect privately held firearms.<ref>[http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/arbejdsomr%C3%A5der/v%C3%A5ben/lovgivning Ministry of Justice \u2013 Weapons]{{da icon}}</ref>\n\n====Finland====\n{{Main|Gun laws in Finland}}\nThe ownership and use of firearms in Finland is regulated by the country's Firearms Act of 1998. Weapons are individually licensed by local police, with no limit on the number of licenses an individual may hold. Licenses are granted for recreational uses, exhibition or (under certain circumstances) professional use. No type of weapon is explicitly prohibited, but licenses are granted only for a reason. In general, this excludes all but hunting and sports guns from non-professional use. Fully automatic weapons are generally not permitted. With the exception of law enforcement, only specially trained security guards may carry loaded weapons in public.\n\nIn November 2007, Finland updated their gun laws to comply with the EU directive by removing the ability of 15- to 18-year-olds to have their own permit, but a possibility to a have dual-license to an already licensed weapon with permission of the license holder remains in that age group. In 2011, a constitutional law committee concluded that people over the age of 20 can receive a permit for semi-automatic handguns; individuals must demonstrate continuous activity in handgun sporting for two years before they can have a license to possess their own handgun.\n\n====France====\n{{Main|Gun laws in France}}\n\nIn France, a hunting license or a sport-shooting license is needed to purchase any firearm. In September 2015, firearms were divided into four categories that determine the regulations that apply to their possession and use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N287|title=Armes|trans-title=Arms|access-date=2016-09-06|language=fr|publisher=Direction de l'information l\u00e9gale et administrative}}</ref> Category C firearms can be obtained with a hunting license, or sport-shooting license with medical certificate. Category C includes mainly single-shot-per-barrel shotguns and single-shot or manual repeating rifles (including centre-fire rifles, for hunting or target shooting). Once legally purchased these  category C arms may be kept, without using them, even when no longer licensed for hunting or sport-shooting.\n\nCategory B firearms are only available to sport-shooters licensed for at least 6 months, with a medical certificate, without any felon convictions, and additionally requires at least three shooting sessions with an instructor. Specific authorisation for purchase and possession may then be sought from local police administration, valid for 5 years renewable. Such arms may then only be used for sport-shooting at shooting ranges, never for hunting. Category B includes all assault type rifles, such as AK-47/AKM, AK-74 or AR-15/M16/M4, and any look-alike arms even when chambred for rimfire cartridges (.22 LR). Obviously these must also be semi-automatic only. All handguns, including rimfire, are classed as category B. It is illegal to possess these category B weapons after expiry of a non-renewed specific authorisation: the arms must be disposed of (sold to a gun shop or else destroyed, for example).\n\nAir-guns including pistols are freely available to adults, as category D arms, provided that their energy level does not exceed 20 J (previously 10 J). Typical energy levels are 6 J for a target pistol and 7.5 J for a target rifle. A scoped Field Target rifle might produce 15 or 16 J (maximum authorised in FT competition). Air-soft arms, firing non-metallic pellets and not exceeding 2 J energy, are considered to be toys, rather than weapons, and so are excluded from firearm regulations.\n\nAlso freely available, in category D, are defensive pepper sprays up to a maximum of 75 g capacity. Bigger capacity sprays are considered offensive weapons, not defensive, and so are classed as category B requiring specific authorisation.\n\nA person cannot own more than 12 centerfire firearms, and cannot own more than 10 magazines and 1,000 rounds of ammunition per firearm. A one-year carry license may be issued for persons \"exposed to exceptional risks to their life\" allowing to carry a handgun and a maximum of 50 rounds. Such authorizations are extremely rare however, as the state would normally insist on providing police protection in such cases. Since November 2015, police officers are authorised to carry their service arm also whilst off-duty.\n\n====Germany====\n{{Main|Gun legislation in Germany}}\nGun ownership in Germany is restrictive, regulated by the Federal Weapons Act (German: Waffengesetz) of 1972.<ref>{{cite web|work=International Firearms Injury Prevention & Policy|url=http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/germany |title=Germany \u2013 Gun Facts, Figures and the Law|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=26 February 2013}}</ref>\nThe laws apply to weapons with a fire energy exceeding {{convert|7.5|J|ftlbf}}. A firearms license may be granted to those over the age of 18 who have no criminal convictions or mental disability, who are deemed reliable and can prove a necessity for owning a firearm. A separate license is required for each firearm owned. Target-shooters must have been a member of a shooting club with 18 recorded visits in the previous 12 months. A firearms carry permit is a second-tier license which allows concealed carry in public, and is only issued to those with a particular need.\n\nSeveral weapons and special ammunitions are completely prohibited, such as automatic firearms. Buying, possessing, lending, using, carrying, crafting, altering and trading of these weapons is illegal and punishable by up to five years imprisonment, confiscation of the weapon and a fine of up to [[Euro|\u20ac]]10,000. Using an illegal weapon for crime of any kind is punishable by from 1 to 10 years imprisonment.\n\nGermany's National Gun Registry, introduced at the end of 2012, counted 5.5 million firearms legally owned by 1.4 million people.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/12/28/new-german-firearms-registry-shows-55-million-guns-legally-owned-in-country/ |title=New German firearms registry shows 5.5 millions guns legally owned in country|publisher=Associated Press/Fox News |accessdate=28 December 2012 |date=28 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Greece====\n[[Greece]] has strict gun control. Shotguns (limited to 3-round capacity), rifles and handguns are allowed, and these require a license issued by provincial police. To purchase handguns and rifles, citizens must either have a concealed-carry permit or a target-shooting permit (for rifles). Semi auto rifles are prohibited. Hunters can own up to 10 shotguns and sport shooters can own up to 7 guns, and there is no license-check or record kept for ammunition purchases for shotguns but target shooters can only own 500 rounds per weapon.\n\n====Hungary====\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}\nGun law in [[Hungary]] is relatively strict, regulated by Code 24/2004,<ref>{{cite web|author=Complex Kiad\u00f3 Kft. |url=http://www.complex.hu/jr/gen/hjegy_doc.cgi?docid=A0400024.TV#lbj9param |title=Hungarian gun law, 24/2004 (Hungarian) |publisher=Complex.hu |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> governmental decision [https://net.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=A0400253.KOR&celpara= 253/2004.

Extensive complaints have arisen over the application of the legislation, with several hundred judicial review cases won in the High Court and Supreme Court by firearms owners, all relating to licensing decisions which had not adhered to the Firearms Act.\n\n====Italy====\n{{Main|Gun laws in Italy}}\nIn Italy, national police issue gun licenses to those over the age of 18 without criminal records, who are not mentally ill or known substance abusers, who can prove competence with firearm safety.  A shooting sports license permits transporting unloaded firearms and firing them in designated shooting ranges. A hunting license allows holders to engage in hunting with firearms. A concealed carry license permits a person to carry a loaded firearm in public, and requires proving a \"valid reason\" to do so (e.g.: a security guard or a jeweler at risk of robbery). The number of firearms an individual may own and retain in their home is limited to three common handguns, twelve sporting handguns or long guns, an unlimited number of hunting long guns, and eight historical firearms (manufactured before 1890). These limits can be exceeded with a collector license.\n\nPrivate firearms must be registered at the local police department within 72 hours of acquisition. Ammunition purchases must also be registered, and possession is normally limited to 200 rounds of handgun ammunition and 1500 rounds of hunting ammunition.\n\n====Netherlands====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], gun ownership is restricted to law enforcement, hunters, and target shooters (self-defense is not a valid reason to own firearms). A hunting license requires passing a hunters safety course. To own a gun for target shooting, the applicant must have been a member of a shooting club for a year. People with felonies, drug addictions, and mental illnesses may not possess firearms.\n\nOnce obtained, firearms must be stored in a safe and annually inspected by police. Firearms may only be used in self-defense as a matter of \"equal force\". Fully automatic firearms are banned, but there are otherwise few restrictions: semi-automatics, handguns, and magazines of all sizes are legal, as are all types of ammunition. A licensed gun owner may only have five firearms registered to his or her license at one time.<ref>[https://www.rnw.org/archive/gun-laws-netherlands Radio Netherlands Worldwide]</ref>\n\n====Poland====\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}\nGun ownership in [[Poland]] is regulated by the Weapons and Munitions Act of 21 May 1999, as further amended,<ref>[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WDU19990530549/T/D19990549L.pdf Weapons and Munitions Act, full text]</ref> which requires a license to own and possess firearms. However, the gun laws were relaxed in 2011 and again in 2014. Also year by year amount of permits given grows. This, in general, removed the police discretionary power to refuse a license without explanation.\nThe current law states that target shooting and collecting permits are shall issue and self-defense one is may issue. Sport-shooting and self-defense permits allows carrying a loaded concealed firearm in public. Formerly sport-shooting permit didn't allowed carry of firearm, but was allowed by current law due to cases of shooters which were robbed on their way to or from shooting range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zbrojnice.com/2018/08/05/kanada-zdroje-nelegalnich-zbrani/ |title=Kanada: zdroje neleg\u00e1ln\u00edch zbran\u00ed (Canada: Sources of illegal weapons) |publisher=Zbrojnice.com |accessdate=2018-08-31}}</ref>\n\nTo obtain a firearms license, the applicant must have no criminal record, undertake a medical and psychological evaluation and pass an exam appropriate to their reason for wanting a firearm (held by the police for self-defense, the Polish Sports Shooting Association for target shooting, or the Polish Hunting Association for hunting). Permits are issued indefinitely, although self-defense ones require passing medical and psychological evaluation every 5 years.\n\nEach permit specifies types and number of weapons the holder can own. These values vary greatly depending on license type and documented needs, but it's an established practice to receive around 5 slots for target shooting and hunting and 10 slots for collecting. A target-shooting license requires the applicant to possess a valid shooting competition license (by taking part in 2 to 4 [[International Shooting Sport Federation|ISSF]]-regulated shooting competitions per year for each category of firearm owned: handgun, rifle and shotgun). A collecting license allows obtaining and use of (in shooting range) any type of unstationary weapon including selective fire and fully automatic firearms. A self-defense license requires proving a \"constant, substantial and higher than average\" danger. There are separate, lifelong permits for high-ranking ex-military and police officers, generally allowing them to own one handgun. Institutional permits allow for firearm ownership by security companies.\n\nReplicas of black powder firearms designed before 1885 require no license to own, and are therefore quite popular in the shooting community.\n\n====Romania====\nGun ownership in [[Romania]] is regulated by [http://legeaz.net/legea-295-2004-armelor-munitiilor/ Law 295/2004].

There are several categories of permits, with different requirements and rights, including hunting permits, self-defense permits, sports shooting permits and collectors permits. The only categories of people who are legally entitled to carry a weapon are owners of self-defense permits, magistrates, [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], military forces and certain categories of diplomats. A [[psychological evaluation]] is required beforehand in all cases.\n\nFurthermore, knives with a blade longer than 15&nbsp;cm are considered weapons and have a similar regime to those of firearms.\n\nIn order for a hunter to obtain a hunting/gun ownership license, he must spend a certain \"practice time\" with a professional hunter. To obtain a self-defense permit, one must be under witness protection. Sporting and collectors licenses require membership in a sport shooting club or collectors' association, respectively.\n\nThe amount of ammunition that can be owned is regulated by permit type. Sporting permits allow the ownership of 1000 matching cartridges per gun; hunting permits allow 300 matching cartridges per gun; self-defense permits allow 50 bullet cartridges and 50 blanks per gun; Collectors permits do not allow for private ownership of ammunition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legeaz.net/monitorul-oficial-929-2015/legea-319-2015-modificarea-legii-295-2004-regim-arme-munitii | title=Legea 319 2015 | publisher=Legeaz.net |date=2015-12-15 |accessdate=2016-10-26}}</ref>\n\nExplosive weapons and ammunitions, fully automatic weapons, weapons camouflaged in the shape of another object, armor-piercing ammunition and lethal weapons that do not fit in any category defined by the law are prohibited\n\nThe type of gun is also regulated by permit.

A self-defense and concealed carry license must be renewed every year, and is only available under special conditions.\n\nA license-holder may own up to 6 shotguns, and unlimited rifles. With a sporting license, valid for 3 years, 1 to 10 handguns may be owned, depending on sports-shooting level. Magazine capacity for semi-automatic centerfire rifles is limited to 4 rounds for sports shooting and 2 rounds for hunting; semi-automatic shotguns are limited to 3 rounds. Rimfire rifles, regardless of type have no magazine limit. Rifles chambered for certain cartridges with military origins are prohibited, such as .223/5.56 NATO and .50 BMG. The .308 Winchester and 7.62x39 mm (AK round) cartridges are only permitted in bolt-action, repetition or single-shot firearms. Proof of ownership of an approved safe is required for all centerfire rifles and handguns, and the owner is responsible for firearm thefts. Ammunition must be stored separately. Rifle and handgun ammunition may only be possessed for legally owned firearms, and purchases and possession is limited to 200 rounds rifle and 100 rounds for handguns. In addition, there are yearly limits in quantity (1000 for rifles,100 for handguns); however additional quantities can be petitioned, mainly for sporting use. For shotgun Ammunition, adults with a valid ID can purchase/possess up to 5,000 shells and there are no yearly limits in quantity. License-holders are only allowed to transport their unloaded firearms from their residence to the shooting range or hunting field and back, with no detours. Firearms may only be discharged at approved shooting ranges or hunting grounds (in season).\n\nThere are firearm license for private security for handguns and rifles. These cannot be used outside of work and must be stored in the workplace premises (with approved safe).\n\nIn addition there are handgun license for self-defense in concealed carry. However, this is granted on a \"may issue\" basis with several standards of necessity to be met and very few are granted. This license must be renewed annually and is not automatic.\n\nMembers of police forces and officers and non-commissioned officers of the armed forces have a special firearms license which encompasses all of the others. There are additional licenses for collectors and muzzle-loading firearms.<ref name=\"Real Decreto 137/1993, de 29 de enero, por el que se aprueba el Reglamento de Armas.

License-holders are usually 18 years or older, and may lend a weapon to a person at least 15 years of age for supervised use.\n\nA license-holder may own up to six hunting rifles, ten handguns, or a mix of eight rifles and handguns. Firearms must be stored in an approved safe. A firearm registered for sport shooting may not be used for hunting. A concealed carry permit can be obtained under very special circumstances, such as a proven threat to life.\n\nFirearm collectors must have a clearly stated demarcation of their interest in collecting (e.g.: pre-World War II British handguns). The police may demand security measures on keeping the collection. Collectors may request a time-limited permit to discharge their weapons. Firearms manufactured before 1890 and not using sealed cartridges are exempt from the weapon law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Vapenlag-199667_sfs-1996-67/#K1 |title=Svensk f\u00f6rfattningssamling 1996:67 Vapenlag (1996:67) |publisher=riksdagen.se |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>\n\n====United Kingdom====\n{{Main|Firearms policy in the United Kingdom}}\nThe UK increased firearm regulation through several Firearms Acts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1997/ukpga_19970005_en_1 |title=Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref>\nleading to an outright ban on automatic firearms and many semi-automatic firearms.

The applicant must have: no criminal convictions; no history of medical condition including alcohol and drug-related conditions; no history of depression, mental or nervous disorder, or epilepsy; and a secure gun safe to store firearms. The FAC additionally requires demonstrating a good reason for each firearm the applicant wishes to own (such as hunting, pest control, collecting, or target shooting). Self-defense is only accepted as a good reason in [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nAn SGC allows the holder to purchase and own any number of shotguns, so long as they can be securely stored. Shotgun magazine capacity is limited to two rounds. For weapons covered under an FAC, police may restrict the type and amount of ammunition held, and where and how the firearms are used.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.met.police.uk/firearms-enquiries/ |title=SC&O19 Firearms Licensing \u2013 Metropolitan Police Service |publisher=Met.police.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref> Aside from Northern Ireland, private ownership of most handguns was banned in 1997, with exception for section 5 fire-arm licenses, which are only generally issued to maritime security personnel, and those under police protection.\n\n==Oceania==\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|Gun laws in Australia}}\nGun laws in Australia are under the jurisdiction of the state governments, which collectively agreed to reforms in the 1996 [[National Firearms Agreement]]. The states issue firearms licenses for hunting, sport shooting, pest control, collecting and for farmers and farm workers. Licenses are prohibited for convicted offenders and those with a history of mental illness. Licenses must be renewed every 3 or 5 years (or 10 years in the Northern Territory and South Australia). Full License-holders must be 18 years of age; minor's permits allow using a firearm under adult supervision by those as young as 12 in most states.\n\nHandguns may be obtained by primary producers (farmers) in some states, sporting (target) shooters, and certain security guards after serving a probationary six-month period with a shooting club. Restricted weapons include military weapons, high-capacity semi-automatic rifles and pump-action and semi-automatic shotguns holding more than 5 cartridges.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|Gun laws in New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand's gun laws comprise the Arms Act of 1983,<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/DLM72622.html Arms Act 1983], legislation.govt.nz</ref>\nArms Amendment Act 1992,<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1992/0095/latest/DLM278351.html Arms Amendment Act 1992], legislation.govt.nz</ref>\nand Arms Regulations 1992,<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1992/0346/latest/DLM168889.html Arms Regulations 1992], legislation.govt.nz</ref>\nand focus mainly on vetting firearm owners. A firearms license may be issued by police to applicants who attend a safety lecture, pass a written test on safety and the Arms Code, and have secure storage for firearms and ammunition; the police will also interview the applicant and two references to be certain the applicant is \"fit and proper\" to own a firearm. Having criminal associations, a history of domestic violence, mental instability, or alcohol or drug abuse almost always result in the application being denied. Misbehavior involving firearms commonly leads to a firearms license being revoked by police. Even when licensed, a person may only be in possession of a firearm for a particular lawful, proper and sufficient purpose,<ref>[http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-code/your-duties-and-legal-requirements \"Arms Code Section 5: Your duties and legal requirements\"], NZ Police</ref>\nfor which the NZ Police policy is to exclude self-defense, however this is not written in the Arms Act or supporting regulations.<ref>[http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-code/firearms-licensing \"''The law does not permit the possession of firearms 'in anticipation' that a firearm may need to be used in self-defence.''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029173445/http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-code/firearms-licensing |date=29 October 2015 }} NZ Police</ref>\n\nOwnership of certain types of firearms require stricter vetting procedures, a higher level of storage security, and a \"special reason\" for obtaining the weapon. The applicant must gain an appropriate endorsement on their license and a permit to procure before obtaining handguns, machine guns, selective-fire assault rifles, and [[military-style semi-automatic]]s (MSSAs) (including those with magazine capacity of more than 15 rounds of rimfire or 7 rounds of centerfire).\n\n== Comparison ==\n{{expand section|date=December 2014}}\n<!--- PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE EDITING\n\nPoints in the yellow fields (\"maybe\"-fields) are needed for better sorting.\n\n\"EU\" marks are important: there are gun laws on the EU-level which are applied to all EU-members.\n\nColors for the \"max penalty\" section:\n* no prison penalties \u2013 green\n* less than 5 years \u2013 yellow\n* 5-10 years \u2013 red\n* more than 10 years \u2013 deep red\n\n--->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Representations of groups are important because they allow many [[group theory|group-theoretic]] problems to be [[reduction (mathematics)|reduced]] to problems in [[linear algebra]], which is well understood. They are also important in [[physics]] because, for example, they describe how the [[symmetry group]] of a physical system affects the solutions of equations describing that system.\n\nThe term ''representation of a group'' is also used in a more general sense to mean any \"description\" of a group as a group of transformations of some mathematical object. More formally, a \"representation\" means a [[homomorphism]] from the group to the [[automorphism group]] of an object. If the object is a vector space we have a ''linear representation''. Some people use ''realization'' for the general notion and reserve the term ''representation'' for the special case of linear representations. The bulk of this article describes linear representation theory; see the last section for generalizations.\n\n==Branches of group representation theory==\nThe representation theory of groups divides into subtheories depending on the kind of group being represented. The various theories are quite different in detail, though some basic definitions and concepts are similar. The most important divisions are:\n\n*''[[Finite group]]s'' &mdash; Group representations are a very important tool in the study of finite groups. They also arise in the applications of finite group theory to [[crystallography]] and to geometry. If the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of scalars of the vector space has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''p'', and if ''p'' divides the order of the group, then this is called ''[[modular representation theory]]''; this special case has very different properties. See [[Representation theory of finite groups]].\n*''[[Compact group]]s or [[locally compact group]]s'' &mdash; Many of the results of finite group representation theory are proved by averaging over the group. These proofs can be carried over to infinite groups by replacement of the average with an integral, provided that an acceptable notion of integral can be defined. This can be done for locally compact groups, using [[Haar measure]]. The resulting theory is a central part of [[harmonic analysis]]. The [[Pontryagin duality]] describes the theory for commutative groups, as a generalised [[Fourier transform]]. See also: [[Peter\u2013Weyl theorem]].\n*''[[Lie groups]]'' &mdash; Many important Lie groups are compact, so the results of compact representation theory apply to them. Other techniques specific to Lie groups are used as well. Most of the groups important in physics and chemistry are Lie groups, and their representation theory is crucial to the application of group theory in those fields. See [[Representations of Lie groups]] and [[Representations of Lie algebras]].\n*''[[Linear algebraic group]]s'' (or more generally  ''affine [[group scheme]]s'') &mdash; These are the analogues of Lie groups, but over more general fields than just '''R''' or '''C'''. Although  linear algebraic groups have a classification that is very similar to that of Lie groups, and give rise to the same families of Lie algebras, their representations are rather different (and much less well understood). The analytic techniques used for studying Lie groups must be replaced by techniques from [[algebraic geometry]], where the relatively weak [[Zariski topology]] causes many technical complications.\n*''Non-compact topological groups'' &mdash; The class of non-compact groups is too broad to construct any general representation theory, but specific special cases have been studied, sometimes using ad hoc techniques. The ''semisimple Lie groups'' have a deep theory, building on the compact case. The complementary ''solvable'' Lie groups cannot be classified in the same way. The general theory for Lie groups deals with [[semidirect product]]s of the two types, by means of general results called ''[[Mackey theory]]'', which is a generalization of [[Wigner's classification]] methods.\n\nRepresentation theory also depends heavily on the type of [[vector space]] on which the group acts. One distinguishes between finite-dimensional representations and infinite-dimensional ones. In the infinite-dimensional case, additional structures are important (e.g. whether or not the space is a [[Hilbert space]], [[Banach space]], etc.).\n\nOne must also consider the type of [[field (mathematics)|field]] over which the vector space is defined. The most important case is the field of [[complex number]]s. The other important cases are the field of [[real numbers]], [[finite field]]s, and fields of [[p-adic number]]s. In general, [[algebraically closed]] fields are easier to handle than non-algebraically closed ones. The [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the field is also significant; many theorems for finite groups depend on the characteristic of the field not dividing the [[Order (group theory)|order of the group]].\n\n==Definitions==\nA '''representation''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' on a [[vector space]] ''V'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is a [[group homomorphism]] from ''G'' to GL(''V''), the [[general linear group#General linear group of a vector space|general linear group]] on ''V''.  That is, a representation is a map \n:<math>\\rho \\colon G \\to \\mathrm{GL}(V)</math> \nsuch that\n:<math>\\rho(g_1 g_2) = \\rho(g_1) \\rho(g_2) , \\qquad \\text{for all }g_1,g_2 \\in G.</math>\n\nHere ''V'' is called the '''representation space''' and the dimension of ''V'' is called the '''dimension''' of the representation. It is common practice to refer to ''V'' itself as the representation when the homomorphism is clear from the context.\n\nIn the case where ''V'' is of finite dimension ''n'' it is common to choose a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for ''V'' and identify GL(''V'') with {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''K'')}}, the group of ''n''-by-''n'' [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] on the field ''K''.\n\n* If ''G'' is a topological group and ''V'' is a [[topological vector space]], a '''continuous representation''' of ''G'' on ''V'' is a representation ''\u03c1'' such that the application {{nowrap|\u03a6 : ''G'' \u00d7 ''V'' \u2192 ''V''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=\u03a6(''g'', ''v'') = ''\u03c1''(''g'')(''v'')}} is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].\n* The '''kernel''' of a representation ''\u03c1'' of a group ''G'' is defined as the normal subgroup of ''G'' whose image under ''\u03c1'' is the identity transformation:\n::<math>\\ker \\rho = \\left\\{g \\in G \\mid \\rho(g) = \\mathrm{id}\\right\\}.</math>\n\n: A [[faithful representation]] is one in which the homomorphism {{nowrap|''G'' \u2192 GL(''V'')}} is [[injective]]; in other words, one whose kernel is the trivial subgroup {''e''} consisting only of the group's identity element.\n\n* Given two ''K'' vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'', two representations {{nowrap|''\u03c1'' : ''G'' \u2192 GL(''V'')}} and {{nowrap|''\u03c0'' : ''G'' \u2192 GL(''W'')}} are said to be '''equivalent''' or '''isomorphic''' if there exists a vector space [[isomorphism]] {{nowrap|''\u03b1'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} so that for all ''g'' in ''G'',\n::<math>\\alpha \\circ \\rho(g) \\circ \\alpha^{-1} = \\pi(g).</math>\n\n== Examples ==\nConsider the complex number ''u'' = e<sup>2\u03c0i / 3</sup> which has the property ''u''<sup>3</sup> = 1. The [[cyclic group]] ''C''<sub>3</sub> = {1, ''u'', ''u''<sup>2</sup>} has a representation \u03c1 on '''C'''<sup>2</sup> given by:\n\n:<math>\n\\rho \\left( 1 \\right) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\qquad\n\\rho \\left( u \\right) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & u \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\qquad\n\\rho \\left( u^2 \\right) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & u^2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThis representation is faithful because \u03c1 is a [[injective|one-to-one map]].\n\nAnother representation for ''C''<sub>3</sub> on '''C'''<sup>2</sup>, isomorphic to the previous one, is \u03c3 given by:\n\n:<math>\n\\sigma \\left( 1 \\right) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\qquad\n\\sigma \\left( u \\right) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nu & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\qquad\n\\sigma \\left( u^2 \\right) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nu^2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe group ''C''<sub>3</sub> may also be faithfully represented on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by \u03c4 given by:\n\n:<math>\n\\tau \\left( 1 \\right) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\qquad\n\\tau \\left( u \\right) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na & -b \\\\\nb & a \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\qquad\n\\tau \\left( u^2 \\right) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b \\\\\n-b & a \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>a=\\text{Re}(u)=-\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\qquad b=\\text{Im}(u)=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.</math>\n\n== Reducibility ==\n\n{{main|Irreducible representation}}\n\nA subspace ''W'' of ''V'' that is invariant under the [[group action]] is called a ''[[subrepresentation]]''. If ''V'' has exactly two subrepresentations, namely the zero-dimensional subspace and ''V'' itself, then the representation is said to be ''irreducible''; if it has a proper subrepresentation of nonzero dimension, the representation is said to be ''reducible''. The representation of dimension zero is considered to be neither reducible nor irreducible, just like the number 1 is considered to be neither composite nor [[prime number|prime]].{{dubious|date=December 2017}}\n\nUnder the assumption that the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the field ''K'' does not divide the size of the group, representations of [[finite group]]s can be decomposed into a [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of irreducible subrepresentations (see [[Maschke's theorem]]). This holds in particular for any representation of a finite group over the [[complex numbers]], since the characteristic of the complex numbers is zero, which never divides the size of a group.\n\nIn the example above, the first two representations given (\u03c1 and \u03c3) are both decomposable into two 1-dimensional subrepresentations (given by span{(1,0)} and span{(0,1)}), while the third representation (\u03c4) is irreducible.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Set-theoretical representations===\nA ''set-theoretic representation'' (also known as a [[group action]] or ''permutation representation'') of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is given by a [[function (mathematics)|function]] \u03c1 : ''G'' \u2192 ''X''<sup>''X''</sup>, the set of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from ''X'' to ''X'', such that for all ''g''<sub>1</sub>, ''g''<sub>2</sub> in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X'':\n\n:<math>\\rho(1)[x] = x</math>\n:<math>\\rho(g_1 g_2)[x]=\\rho(g_1)[\\rho(g_2)[x]].</math>\n\nThis condition and the axioms for a group imply that \u03c1(''g'') is a [[bijection]] (or [[permutation]]) for all ''g'' in ''G''. Thus we may equivalently define a permutation representation to be a [[group homomorphism]] from G to the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''X''</sub> of ''X''.\n\nFor more information on this topic see the article on [[group action]].\n\n===Representations in other categories===\nEvery group ''G'' can be viewed as a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with a single object; [[morphism]]s in this category are just the elements of ''G''. Given an arbitrary category ''C'', a ''representation'' of ''G'' in ''C'' is a [[functor]] from ''G'' to ''C''. Such a functor selects an object ''X'' in ''C'' and a group homomorphism from ''G'' to Aut(''X''), the [[automorphism group]] of ''X''.\n\nIn the case where ''C'' is '''Vect'''<sub>''K''</sub>, the [[category of vector spaces]] over a field ''K'', this definition is equivalent to a linear representation. Likewise, a set-theoretic representation is just a representation of ''G'' in the [[category of sets]].\n\nWhen ''C'' is '''Ab''', the [[category of abelian groups]], the objects obtained are called [[G-module|''G''-modules]].\n\nFor another example consider the [[category of topological spaces]], '''Top'''. Representations in '''Top''' are homomorphisms from ''G'' to the [[homeomorphism]] group of a topological space ''X''.\n\nTwo types of representations closely related to linear representations are:\n*[[projective representation]]s: in the category of [[projective space]]s. These can be described as \"linear representations [[up to]] scalar transformations\". \n*[[affine representation]]s: in the category of [[affine space]]s. For example, the [[Euclidean group]] acts affinely upon [[Euclidean space]].\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Character theory]]\n*[[List of harmonic analysis topics]]\n*[[List of representation theory topics]]\n*[[Representation theory of finite groups]]\n\n==References==\n* {{Fulton-Harris}}.

The term \"Gardnerian\" was probably coined by the founder of [[Cochrane's Craft|Cochranian Witchcraft]], [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]] in the 1950s or 60s, who himself left that tradition to found his own.<ref>''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 122</ref>\n\nGardner claimed to have learned the beliefs and practises that would later become known as Gardnerian Wicca from the [[New Forest coven]], who allegedly initiated him into their ranks in 1939. For this reason, Gardnerian Wicca is usually considered to be the earliest created tradition of Wicca, from which most subsequent Wiccan traditions are derived.\n\nFrom the supposed New Forest coven, Gardner formed his own [[Bricket Wood coven]], and in turn initiated many Witches, including a series of High Priestesses, founding further covens and continuing the initiation of more Wiccans into the tradition. In the UK, Europe and most Commonwealth countries someone self-defined as Wiccan is usually understood to be claiming initiatory descent from Gardner, either through Gardnerian Wicca, or through a derived branch such as [[Alexandrian Wicca]] or [[Algard Wicca]]. Elsewhere, these original lineaged traditions are termed \"[[British Traditional Wicca]]\".\n\n==Beliefs and practices==\n\n===Covens and initiatory lines===\nGardnerian Wiccans organise into [[coven]]s, that traditionally, though not always, are limited to thirteen members. Covens are led by a High Priestess and the High Priest of her choice, and celebrate both a Goddess and a God.\n\nGardnerian Wicca and other forms of [[British Traditional Wicca]] operate as an initiatory [[mystery cult]]; membership is gained only through [[initiation]] by a Wiccan High Priestess or High Priest. Any valid line of initiatory descent can be traced all the way back to [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], and through him back to the [[New Forest coven]].\n\nRituals and coven practices are kept secret from non-initiates, and many Wiccans maintain secrecy regarding their membership in the Religion. Whether any individual Wiccan chooses secrecy or openness often depends on their location, career, and life circumstances. In all cases, Gardnerian Wicca absolutely forbids any member to share the name, personal information, fact of membership, and so on without advanced individual consent of that member for that specific instance of sharing. (In this regard, secrecy is specifically for reasons of safety, in parallel to the LGBT custom of being \"in the closet\", the heinousness of the act of \"outing\" anyone, and the dire possibilities of the consequences to an individual who is \"outed\". Wiccans often refer to being in or out of the \"broom closet\", to make the exactness of the parallel clear.)\n\nIn Gardnerian Wicca, there are three grades of initiation. [[Ronald Hutton]] suggests that they appear to be based upon the three grades of [[Freemasonry]].<ref>''The Triumph of the Moon'', [[Ronald Hutton]]</ref>{{Request quotation|date=January 2009}}\n\n===Theology===\nIn Gardnerian Wicca, the two principal deities are the [[Horned God]] and the [[Mother Goddess]]. Gardnerians use specific names for the God and the Goddess in their rituals. [[Doreen Valiente]], a Gardnerian High Priestess, revealed that there were more than one. She said that Gardner referred to the Goddess as Airdia or Areda, which she believed was derived from [[Aradia]], the deity that [[Charles Leland]] claimed was worshipped by Italian witches. She said that the God was called [[Cernunnos]], or Kernunno, which in Celtic meant \"The Horned One\". Another name by which Gardnerians called the God was Janicot (pronounced Jan-e-ko{{Clarify|date=October 2018|reason=please use IPA (Help:IPA) or respelling (Help:Pronunciation respelling key)}}), which she believed was [[Basque language|Basque]] in origin.<ref>''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 52-53</ref>\n\n===Ethics and morality===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2008|talk=y}}\n\nThe Gardnerian tradition teaches a core ethical guideline, often referred to as \"The Rede\" or \"The [[Wiccan Rede]]\". In the archaic language often retained in some Gardnerian lore, the Rede states, \"An it harm none, do as thou wilt.\"<ref>Gardner, Gerald Brousseau; The Meaning of Witchcraft; Aquarian Press, London, 1959, page 127</ref>\n<blockquote>Witches ... are inclined to the morality of the legendary Good King Pausol, \u201cDo what you like so long as you harm no one\". But they believe a certain law to be important, \u201cYou must not use magic for anything which will cause harm to anyone, and if, to prevent a greater wrong being done, you must discommode someone, you must do it only in a way which will abate the harm.\"</blockquote>\n\nTwo features stand out about the Rede. The first is that the word rede means \"advice\" or \"counsel\". The Rede is not a commandment but a recommendation, a guideline.  The second is that the advice to harm none stands at equal weight with the advice to do as one wills. Thus Gardnerian Wiccan teachings stand firm against coercion and for [[informed consent]]; forbid proselytization while requiring anyone seeking to become an initiate of Gardnerian Wicca to ask for teaching, studies, initiation. To expound a little further, the qualifying phrase \"an (if) it harm none\" includes not only other, but self. Hence, weighing the possible outcomes of an action is a part of the thought given before taking an action; the metaphor of tossing a pebble into a pond and observing the ripples that spread in every direction is sometimes used. The declarative statement \"do as thou wilt\" expresses a clear statement of what is, philosophically, known as \"[[free will]].\"<ref>Gregg D Caruso (2012). Free Will and Consciousness: A Determinist Account of the Illusion of Free Will. Lexington Books. p. 8. {{ISBN|0739171364}}</ref>\n\nA second ethical guideline is often called the Law of Return, sometimes the Rule of Three, which mirrors the physics concept described in Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s Third Law of Motion: \"When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.\"<ref>[[Newton's laws of motion]]</ref> This basic law of physics is more usually today stated thus: \"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"<ref>http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/newton3.html</ref> Like the Rede, this guideline teaches Gardnerians that whatever energy or intention one puts out into the world, whether magical or not, some response of equal effect will return. This teaching underlies the importance of doing no harm\u2014for that would give impetus to a negative reaction centered on oneself or one's group (such as a coven).\n\nIn Gardnerian Wicca, these tradition-specific teachings demand thought before action, especially magical action (spell work). An individual or a coven uses these guidelines to consider beforehand what the possible ramifications may be of any working. Given these two ethical core principles, Gardnerian Wicca hold themselves to a high ethical standard. For example, Gardnerian High Priestess Eleanor Bone was not only a respected elder in the tradition, but also a matron of a nursing home. Moreover, the Bricket Wood coven today is well known for its many members from academic or intellectual backgrounds, who contribute to the preservation of Wiccan knowledge. Gerald Gardner himself actively disseminated educational resources on folklore and the occult to the general public through his Museum of Witchcraft on the Isle of Man. Therefore, Gardnerian Wicca can be said to differ from some modern non-coven Craft practices that often concentrate on the solitary practitioner's spiritual development.\n\nThe religion tends to be non-dogmatic, allowing each initiate to find for him/herself what the ritual experience means by using the basic language of the shared ritual tradition, to be discovered through the Mysteries.<ref>Akasha and Eran (1996). \"Gardnerian Wicca: An Introduction\" http://bichaunt.org/Gardnerian.html</ref> The tradition is often characterised as an [[orthopraxy]] (correct practice) rather than an [[orthodoxy]] (correct thinking), with adherents placing greater emphasis on a shared body of practices as opposed to faith.<ref>Fritz Muntean (2006) \"A Witch in the Halls of Wisdom\" interview conducted by Sylvana Silverwitch http://www.widdershins.org/vol1iss3/l03.htm</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Gardner and the New Forest coven===\n{{Main|New Forest coven}}\n\nOn retirement from the British Colonial Service, Gardner moved to London but then before [[World War II]] moved to [[Highcliffe]], east of [[Bournemouth]] and near the [[New Forest]] on the south coast of England. After attending a performance staged by the [[Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship]], he reports meeting a group of people who had preserved their historic occult practices. They recognised him as being \"one of them\" and convinced him to be initiated. It was only halfway through the initiation, he says, that it dawned on him what kind of group it was, and that witchcraft was still being practiced in England.<ref name=\"Gardner, Gerald 1954\">Gardner, Gerald (1954). ''Witchcraft Today'' London: Rider and Company</ref>\n\nThe group into which Gardner was initiated, known as the [[New Forest coven]], was small and utterly secret as the [[Witchcraft Act of 1735]] made it illegal\u2014a crime\u2014to claim to predict the future, conjure spirits, or cast spells; it likewise made an accusation of witchcraft a criminal offense. Gardner's enthusiasm over the discovery that witchcraft survived in England led him to wish to document it, but both the witchcraft laws and the coven's secrecy forbade that, despite his excitement. After World War II, Gardner's High Priestess and coven leader relented sufficiently to allow a fictional treatment that did not expose them to prosecution, \"High Magic's Aid\".<ref>Gerald Gardner (1949). ''High Magic's Aid'' London: Michael Houghton</ref> \n<blockquote>Anyhow, I soon found myself in the circle and took the usual oaths of secrecy which bound me not to reveal any secrets of the cult. But, as it is a dying cult, I thought it was a pity that all the knowledge should be lost, so in the end I was permitted to write, as fiction, something of what a witch believes in the novel High Magic's Aid.</blockquote><ref name=\"Gardner, Gerald 1954\"/>\n\nAfter the witchcraft laws were repealed in 1951, and replaced by the Fraudulent Mediums Act, Gerald Gardner went public, publishing his first non-fiction book about [[Witchcraft]], \"Witchcraft Today\", in 1954. Gardner continued, as the text often iterates, to respect his oaths and the wishes of his High Priestess in his writing.<ref name=\"Gardner, Gerald 1954\"/> Fearing, as Gardner stated in the quote above, that witchcraft was literally dying out, he pursued publicity and welcomed new initiates during that last years of his life. Gardner even courted the attentions of the tabloid press, to the consternation of some more conservative members of the tradition. In Gardner's own words, \"Witchcraft doesn't pay for broken windows!\"<ref name=\"Gardner, Gerald 1954\"/>\n\nGardner knew many famous occultists. Ross Nichols was a friend and fellow Druid (until 1964 Chairman of the [[Ancient Order of Druids]], when he left to found his own Druidic [[Order of Bards, Ovates, and Druids]]). Nichols edited Gardner's \"Witchcraft Today\" and is mentioned extensively in Gardner's \"The Meaning of Witchcraft\". Near the end of [[Aleister Crowley]]'s life, Gardner met with him for the first time on May 1, 1947, and visited him twice more before Crowley's death that autumn; at some point, Crowley gave Gardner an [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO) charter and the 4th OTO degree\u2014the lowest degree authorizing use of the charter.<ref>\"Gardner & Crowley: the Overstated Connection\" [[Don Frew]] Pantheacon 1996</ref>\n\n[[Doreen Valiente]], one of Gardner's priestesses, identified the woman who initiated Gardner as [[Dorothy Clutterbuck]], referenced in \"A Witches' Bible\" by [[Janet Farrar|Janet]] and [[Stewart Farrar]].<ref>Farrar, Janet & Stewart (2002). \"A Witches' Bible.\" Robert Hale. {{ISBN|0-7090-7227-9}}</ref> Valiente's identification was based on references Gardner made to a woman he called \"Old Dorothy\" whom Valiente remembered. Biographer [[Philip Heselton]] corrects Valiente, clarifying that Clutterbuck (Dorothy St. Quintin-Fordham, {{n\u00e9e}} Clutterbuck), a Pagan-minded woman, owned the Mill House, where the New Forest coven performed Gardner's initiation ritual.<ref>Heselton, Philip (2012). \"Witchfather: A Life of Gerald Gardner. Volume 1: Into the Witch Cult.\" Loughborough, Leicestershire: Thoth Publications.</ref>  Scholar [[Ronald Hutton]] argues in his ''Triumph of the Moon'' that Gardner's tradition was largely the inspiration of members of the [[Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship]] and especially that of a woman known by the magical name of \"[[Edith Woodford-Grimes|Dafo]]\".<ref>Hutton, Ronald (2001). ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-285449-6}}</ref> Dr. [[Leo Ruickbie]], in his ''Witchcraft Out of the Shadows'', analysed the documented evidence and concluded that [[Aleister Crowley]] played a crucial role in inspiring Gardner to establish a new pagan religion.<ref>[[Leo Ruickbie|Ruickbie, Leo]](2004). ''Witchcraft out of the Shadows: A Complete History''. Robert Hale Limited. {{ISBN|0-7090-7567-7}}</ref> Ruickbie, Hutton, and others further argue that much of what has been published of Gardnerian Wicca, as Gardner's practice came to be known, was written by Blake, Yeats, [[Doreen Valiente|Valiente]] and [[Aleister Crowley|Crowley]] and contains borrowings from other identifiable sources.<ref>Hutton, ''Triumph of the Moon'' p.237</ref>\n\nThe witches Gardner was originally introduced to were originally referred to by him as \"the Wica\" and he would often use the term \"Witch [[Cult (religious practice)|Cult]]\" to describe the religion. Other terms used, included \"Witchcraft\" or \"the Old Religion.\" Later publications standardised the spelling to \"Wicca\" and it came to be used as the term for the Craft, rather than its followers. \"Gardnerian\" was originally a pejorative term used by Gardner's contemporary Roy Bowers (also known as Robert Cochrane), a British [[cunning man]],<ref>''Pentagram'' magazine 1965</ref> who nonetheless was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca a couple of years following Gardner's death.<ref>Doyle White, Ethan (2011). \"Robert Cochrane and the Gardnerian Craft: Feuds, Secrets, and Mysteries in Contemporary British Witchcraft\". The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies 13 (2): 205\u2013224.</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction of the Wiccan rituals===\nGardner stated that the rituals of the existing group were fragmentary at best, and he set about fleshing them out, drawing on his library and knowledge as an [[occult]]ist and amateur [[folklorist]]. Gardner borrowed and wove together appropriate material from other artists and occultists, most notably [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', the [[Key of Solomon]] as published by [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|S.L. MacGregor Mathers]], [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] ritual, Crowley, and [[Rudyard Kipling]]. [[Doreen Valiente]] wrote much of the best-known poetry, including the much-quoted [[Charge of the Goddess]].<ref>Hutton, ''Triumph of the Moon'' p.247</ref>\n\n===Bricket Wood and the North London coven===\nIn 1948-9 Gardner and [[Edith Woodford-Grimes|Dafo]] were running a coven separate from the original New Forest coven at a [[naturist]] club near [[Bricket Wood]] to the north of London.<ref>Hutton, ''Triumph of the Moon'' p.227.</ref> By 1952 Dafo's health had begun to decline, and she was increasingly wary of Gardner's publicity-seeking.<ref>[[Doreen Valiente|Valiente, Doreen]]. ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'' (1989) Custer, WA: Phoenix. pp 38,66.</ref> In 1953 Gardner met [[Doreen Valiente]] who was to become his High Priestess in succession to Dafo. The question of publicity led to Doreen and others formulating thirteen proposed 'Rules for the Craft',<ref>[[Aidan Kelly|Kelly, Aidan]]. ''Crafting the Art of Magic'' (1991) St Paul, MN: Llewellyn. pp 103-5, 145-161.</ref> which included restrictions on contact with the press. Gardner responded with the sudden production of the [[Wiccan Laws]] which led to some of his members, including Valiente, leaving the coven.<ref>Hutton, ''Triumph of the Moon'' p249.</ref>\n\nGardner reported that witches were taught that the power of the human body can be released, for use in a coven's circle, by various means, and released more easily without clothing. A simple method was dancing round the circle singing or chanting;<ref name=\"Gardner, Gerald 1954\"/> another method was the traditional \"binding and scourging.\"<ref name=Scholars>{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Charlotte|title=The Scholars and the Goddess|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/wicca/wicca29.html|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=Atlantic Monthly|date=Jan., 2001, vol. 287, issue 1.}}</ref> In addition to raising power, \"binding and scourging\" can heighten the initiates' sensitivity and spiritual experience.<ref name=Scourge>{{cite web|last=Anon.

''Fifty Years of Wicca'' Sutton Mallet, England: Green Press. {{ISBN|0-9547230-1-5}}</ref> It was also about this time that the lesser 4 of the 8 Sabbats were given greater prominence. Brickett Wood coven members liked the Sabbat celebrations so much, they decided that there was no reason to keep them confined to the closest full moon meeting, and made them festivities in their own right. As Gardner had no objection to this change suggested by the Brickett Wood coven, this collective decision resulted in what is now the standard eight festivities in the Wiccan [[Wheel of the year]].<ref>Lamond, ''Fifty Years of Wicca'', p.16.</ref>\n\nThe split with Valiente led to the Bricket Wood coven being led by Jack Bracelin and a new High Priestess, Dayonis. This was the first of a number of disputes between individuals and groups,<ref>Hutton, ''Triumph of the Moon''</ref> but the increased publicity only seems to have allowed Gardnerian Wicca to grow much more rapidly. Certain initiates such as [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and [[Raymond Buckland]] who brought his take on the Gardnerian tradition to the United States in 1964 started off their own major traditions allowing further expansion.\n\nA partial summary of publicly known Wiccan descendants from Gardner is available [http://www.thewica.co.uk/wica/wica.htm here].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Wicca}}\n* [http://www.geraldgardner.com/ Gerald Gardner - The History of Wicca]\n* [http://www.thewica.co.uk/ Gardnerian History]\n* [http://www.channel4.com/programmes/a-very-british-witchcraft ''A Very British Witchcraft'' TV program] \n----\n{{WiccaandWitchcraft}}\n\n[[Category:Wiccan traditions]]", "sha1": "hkyxy2fnbtcaodxxmwhw1m62wuiuemk"}}, {"title": "G-d", "ns": "0", "id": "12698", "redirect": {"title": "Names of God in Judaism"}, "revision": {"id": "783863359", "parentid": "720674394", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:57:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Names of God in Judaism#English names]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R to section}}\n}}", "sha1": "f7poam9jclyxkvxi0k8r1v5kf4ji2ls"}}, {"title": "GMT", "ns": "0", "id": "12700", "redirect": {"title": "Greenwich Mean Time"}, "revision": {"id": "769625267", "parentid": "760312484", "timestamp": "2017-03-10T18:08:14Z", "contributor": {"username": "Christian75", "id": "1306352"}, "comment": "/* top */{{redr}} is deprecated - converting to {{Redirect category shell|}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Greenwich Mean Time]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|\n{{R from initialism}}\n}}", "sha1": "3hq49mubwq9h867st1sfd9j29ly78fc"}}, {"title": "Greenwich Mean Time", "ns": "0", "id": "12701", "revision": {"id": "861789695", "parentid": "861716861", "timestamp": "2018-09-30T01:24:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Jayron32", "id": "1623918"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Changed protection level for \"[[Greenwich Mean Time]]\": Persistent [[WP:Block#Evasion of blocks|block evasion]]: [[WP:LTA/VXFC]] ([Edit=Require autoconfirmed or confirmed access] (expires 01:24, 30 September 2019 (UTC)) [Move=Require administrator access] (indefinite))", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the time  standard|the film|G:MT \u2013 Greenwich Mean Time}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{EngvarB | date=July 2014}}\n{{Infobox time zone\n|caption=This is the zone marked '0' in the middle of the map, coloured green.\n|initials=GMT\n|display observance=no\n}}\n{{Time zones of Europe}}\n{{Time zones of Africa}}\n\n'''Greenwich Mean Time''' ('''GMT''') is the [[Local mean time|mean]] [[solar time]] at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] in [[Greenwich]], [[London]], reckoned from midnight. At different times in the past, it has been calculated in different ways, including being calculated from noon;<ref>{{cite web |title=Time scales |url=https://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/timescales.html#GMT |website=UCO Lick |accessdate=28 July 2018}}</ref> as a consequence, it cannot be used to specify a precise time unless a context is given.\n\nEnglish speakers often use GMT as a synonym for [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC).<ref>{{Oxford Dictionaries|Coordinated Universal Time}}</ref> For navigation, it is considered equivalent to [[UT1]] (the modern form of mean solar time at 0\u00b0 longitude); but this meaning can differ from UTC by up to 0.9{{nbsp}}s. The term GMT should not thus be used for technical purposes.<ref>Hilton and McCarthy 2013, p. 231&ndash;2.</ref>\n\nBecause of Earth's uneven speed in its elliptical [[orbit]] and its [[axial tilt]], noon (12:00:00) GMT is rarely the exact moment the [[sun]] crosses the [[Greenwich meridian]] and reaches its highest point in the sky there. This event may occur up to 16 minutes before or after noon GMT, a discrepancy calculated by the [[equation of time]]. Noon GMT is the annual average (i.e. \"mean\") moment of this event, which accounts for the word \"mean\" in \"Greenwich Mean Time\".\n\nOriginally, astronomers considered a GMT day to start at noon while for almost everyone else it started at midnight. To avoid confusion, the name [[Universal Time]] was introduced to denote GMT as counted from midnight.<ref name = McCarthySeidelmann2009/> Astronomers preferred the old convention to simplify their observational data, so that each night was logged under a single calendar date. Today Universal Time usually refers to UTC or UT1.<ref>''Astronomical Almanac Online'' 2015, Glossary s.v. \"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#ut Universal Time]\".</ref>\n\nThe term \"GMT\" is especially used by bodies connected with the United Kingdom, such as the [[BBC World Service]], the [[Royal Navy]], the [[Met Office]] and others particularly in Arab countries, such as the [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] and [[OSN]]. It is a term commonly used in the United Kingdom and countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Malaysia; and in many other countries of the eastern hemisphere. In some countries (the United Kingdom for example) Greenwich Mean Time is the legal time in the winter and the population uses the term. See GMT in legislation, below, for further explanation.\n\n== History ==\n\n{{Main|History of longitude}}\n\n[[Image:Greenwich clock.jpg|thumb | left | [[Shepherd Gate Clock|Greenwich clock]] with standard measurements]]\n\nAs the United Kingdom grew into an advanced [[maritime nation]], British mariners kept at least one [[marine chronometer|chronometer]] on GMT to calculate their [[longitude]] from the [[prime meridian|Greenwich meridian]], which was by convention considered to have longitude zero degrees, internationally adopted in the [[International Meridian Conference]] of 1884. Synchronisation of the chronometer on GMT did not affect shipboard time, which was still solar time. But this practice, combined with mariners from other nations drawing from [[Nevil Maskelyne]]'s method of [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]]s based on observations at Greenwich, led to GMT being used worldwide as a standard time independent of location. Most [[time zone]]s were based upon GMT, as an offset of a number of hours (and possibly half or quarter hours) \"ahead of GMT\" or \"behind GMT\".\n\nGreenwich Mean Time was adopted across the island of [[Great Britain]] by the [[Railway Clearing House]] in 1847, and by almost all railway companies by the following year, from which the term \"[[railway time]]\" is derived. It was gradually adopted for other purposes, but a legal case in 1858 held \"[[local mean time]]\" to be the official time.<ref>Howse 1997, p. 114.</ref> On 14 May 1880, a letter signed by 'Clerk to Justices' appeared in 'The Times', stating that \"Greenwich time is now kept almost throughout England, but it appears that Greenwich time is not legal time. For example, our polling booths were opened, say, at 8 13 and closed at 4 13 p.m.\"<ref>CLERK TO JUSTICES.

GMT was adopted on the [[Isle of Man]] in 1883, [[Jersey]] in 1898 and [[Guernsey]] in 1913. Ireland adopted GMT in 1916, supplanting [[Dublin Mean Time]].<ref name=\"Myers\">Myers (2007).</ref> Hourly [[time signal]]s from Greenwich Observatory were first broadcast on 5 February 1924, rendering the [[time ball]] at the observatory redundant.\n\nThe daily rotation of the Earth is irregular (see [[\u0394T]]) and constantly slows; therefore the [[atomic clock]]s constitute a much more stable timebase. On 1 January 1972, GMT was superseded as the international civil time standard by Coordinated Universal Time, maintained by an ensemble of atomic clocks around the world. [[Universal Time|Universal Time (UT)]], a term introduced in 1928, initially represented mean time at Greenwich determined in the traditional way to accord with the originally defined [[International Meridian Conference|universal day]]; from 1 January 1956 (as decided by the [[IAU]] at Dublin, 1955, at the initiative of [[William Markowitz]]) this \"raw\" form of UT was re-labelled UT0 and effectively superseded by refined forms UT1 (UT0 equalised for the effects of polar wandering)<ref>[http://www.iers.org/MainDisp.csl?pid=101-181 UT1 as explained on IERS page]</ref> and UT2 (UT1 further equalised for annual seasonal variations in earth rotation rate).\n\n{{quote | Indeed, even the Greenwich meridian itself is not quite what it used to be\u2014defined by \"the centre of the transit instrument at the Observatory at Greenwich\". Although that instrument still survives in working order, it is no longer in use and now the meridian of origin of the world's longitude and time is not strictly defined in material form but from a statistical solution resulting from observations of all time-determination stations which the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]] takes into account when co-ordinating the world's time signals. Nevertheless, the line in the old observatory's courtyard today differs no more than a few metres from that imaginary line which is now the prime meridian of the world. | Howse, D. (1997). ''Greenwich time and the longitude''. London: Philip Wilson. | }}\n\n== Ambiguity in the definition of GMT ==\n\nHistorically GMT has been used with two different conventions for numbering hours. The long-standing astronomical convention dating from the work of [[Ptolemy]], was to refer to [[noon]] as zero hours (see [[Julian day]]). This contrasted with the civil convention of referring to [[midnight]] as zero hours dating from the Romans. The latter convention was adopted on and after 1 January 1925 for astronomical purposes, resulting in a discontinuity of 12 hours, or half a day. The instant that was designated 'December 31.5 GMT' in 1924 almanacs became 'January 1.0 GMT' in 1925 almanacs. The term Greenwich Mean Astronomical Time (GMAT) was introduced to unambiguously refer to the previous noon-based astronomical convention for GMT.<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Astronomical Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac\n | publisher = University Science Books\n | year = 1992\n | isbn = 0-935702-68-7\n | page = 76\n}}</ref> The more specific terms UT and UTC do not share this ambiguity, always referring to midnight as zero hours.\n\n== GMT in legislation ==\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nLegally, the civil time used in the UK is called still \"Greenwich mean time\" (without capitalisation), according to the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], with an exception made for those periods when the Summer Time Act 1972 orders an hour's shift for daylight saving. The Interpretation Act 1978, section 9, provides that whenever an expression of time occurs in an Act, the time referred to shall (unless otherwise specifically stated) be held to be Greenwich mean time. Under subsection 23(3), the same rule applies to deeds and other instruments.<ref name=\"Myers\"/>\n\nDuring the experiment of 1968-1971, when the British Isles did not revert to Greenwich Mean Time during the winter, the all-year [[British Summer Time]] was called British Standard Time (BST).\n\nIn the UK, UTC+0 is disseminated to the general public in winter and UTC+1 in summer.<ref>Howse 1997, p. 157.</ref><ref name = McCarthySeidelmann2009>[[Dennis McCarthy (scientist)|McCarthy]] & Seidelmann 2009, p. 17.</ref>\n\nBBC radio stations broadcast the \"six pips\" of the [[Greenwich Time Signal]]. It is named from its original generation at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Greenwich Observatory]], is aligned to Coordinated Universal Time, and called either Greenwich Mean Time or British Summer Time as appropriate for the time of year.\n\n=== Other countries ===\n\nSeveral countries define their local time by reference to Greenwich Mean Time.<ref name=\"AMANO\">Dumortier, Hannelore, & Loncke (n.d.)</ref><ref name=\"Seago\">Seago & Seidelmann (2011).</ref> Some examples are:\n* Belgium: Decrees of 1946 and 1947 set legal time as one hour ahead of GMT.<ref name=\"AMANO\"/>\n* Ireland: Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971, section 1, and Interpretation Act 2005, part iv, section 18(i).\n* Canada: Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Several provinces, such as [[Nova Scotia]] (Time Definition Act.

The 'GMT' time zone, were it drawn by purely [[geography|geographical terms]], would consist of the area between meridians 7\u00b030'W and 7\u00b030'E. As a result, there are European locales that despite lying in an area with a 'physical' UTC time use another time zone ([[UTC+1]] in particular); conversely, there are European areas that use UTC, even though their 'physical' time zone is [[UTC-1|UTC\u22121]] (e.g., most of [[Portugal]]), or UTC\u22122 (the westernmost part of [[Iceland]]). Because the UTC time zone in Europe is 'shifted' to the west, [[Lowestoft]] in the [[United Kingdom]] at only 1\u00b045'E is the easternmost settlement in Europe in which UTC is applied. Following is a list of the 'incongruencies':\n\n;Countries (or parts thereof) west of 22\u00b030'W (\"physical\" UTC\u22122) that use UTC\n* The westernmost part of Iceland, including the northwest peninsula and its main town of [[\u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]], which is west of 22\u00b030'W, uses UTC.

(Only the easternmost part, including cities such as [[Bragan\u00e7a (Portugal)|Bragan\u00e7a]] and [[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]], lies east of 7\u00b030'W.) Since the [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]] in 1386 (the world's oldest diplomatic alliance), Portugal has maintained close ties to the UK, which possibly explains its choice of UTC. [[Madeira]], even further to the west, also employs UTC.

It also supports [[animation]]s and allows a separate [[palette (computing)|palette]] of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make GIF less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with color gradients, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color.\n\nGIF images are compressed using the [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch]] (LZW) [[lossless data compression]] technique to reduce the file size without degrading the visual quality. This compression technique was patented in 1985. Controversy over the licensing agreement between the [[software patent]] holder, [[Unisys]], and CompuServe in 1994 spurred the development of the [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG) standard. By 2004 all the relevant patents had expired.\n\n==History==\n[[CompuServe]] introduced GIF on June 15, 1987 to provide a color image format for their file downloading areas, replacing their earlier [[run-length encoding]] (RLE) format, which was black and white only. GIF became popular because it used [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch|LZW data compression]], which was more efficient than the run-length encoding that formats such as those used by [[PCX]] and [[MacPaint]], and fairly large images could therefore be downloaded in a reasonably short time, even with very slow [[modem]]s.\n\nThe original version of GIF was called '''87a'''.<ref name=\"87aSpec\" /> In 1989, CompuServe released an enhanced version, called '''89a''',<ref name=\"89aSpec\" /> which added support for animation delays (multiple images in a stream were already supported in 87a), transparent background colors, and storage of application-specific metadata. The 89a specification also supports incorporating text labels as text (not embedding them in the graphical data), but as there is little control over display fonts, this feature is not widely used. The two versions can be distinguished by looking at the first six [[byte]]s of the file (the \"[[magic number (programming)|magic number]]\" or signature), which, when interpreted as [[ASCII]], read \"GIF87a\" and \"GIF89a\", respectively.\n\nCompuServe encouraged the adoption of GIF by providing downloadable conversion utilities for many computers.

Many GIF files have a single image that fills the entire logical screen. Others divide the logical screen into separate sub-images. The images may also function as animation frames in an animated GIF file, but again these need not fill the entire logical screen.\n\nGIF files start with a fixed-length header (\"GIF87a\" or \"GIF89a\") giving the version, followed by a fixed-length Logical Screen Descriptor giving the pixel dimensions and other characteristics of the logical screen. The screen descriptor may also specify the presence and size of a Global Color Table, which follows next if present.\n\nThereafter, the file is divided into segments, each introduced by a 1-byte sentinel:\n\n* An image (introduced by 0x2C, an ASCII comma <tt>','</tt>)\n* An extension block (introduced by 0x21, an ASCII exclamation point <tt>'!'</tt>)\n* The trailer (a single byte of value 0x3B, an ASCII semicolon <tt>';'</tt>), which should be the last byte of the file.\n\nAn image starts with a fixed-length Image Descriptor, which may specify the presence and size of a Local Color Table (which follows next if present). The image data follows: one byte giving the bit width of the unencoded symbols (which must be at least 2 bits wide, even for bi-color images), followed by a linked list of sub-blocks containing the LZW-encoded data.\n\nExtension blocks (blocks that \"extend\" the 87a definition via a mechanism already defined in the 87a spec) consist of the sentinel, an additional byte specifying the type of extension, and a linked list of sub-blocks with the extension data. Extension blocks that modify an image (like the Graphic Control Extension that specifies the optional animation delay time and optional transparent background color) must immediately precede the segment with the image they refer to.\n\nThe linked lists used by the image data and the extension blocks consist of series of sub-blocks, each sub-block beginning with a byte giving the number of subsequent data bytes in the sub-block (1 to 255). The series of sub-blocks is terminated by an empty sub-block (a 0 byte).\n\nThis structure allows the file to be parsed even if not all parts are understood. A GIF marked 87a may contain extension blocks; the intent is that a decoder can read and display the file without the features covered in extensions it does not understand.\n\nThe full detail of the file format is covered in the GIF specification.<ref name=\"89aSpec\"/>\n\n==Palettes==\n[[File:Sunflower as gif websafe.gif|thumb|right|An example of a GIF image saved with a [[web-safe]] palette and dithered using the [[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering|Floyd\u2013Steinberg]] method. Due to the reduced number of colors in the image, there are display issues.]]\nGIF is palette-based: the colors used in an image (a frame) in the file have their [[RGB]] values defined in a [[Palette (computing)|palette table]] that can hold up to 256 entries, and the data for the image refer to the colors by their indices (0\u2013255) in the palette table. The color definitions in the palette can be drawn from a color space of millions of shades (2<sup>24</sup> shades, 8 bits for each primary), but the maximum number of colors a frame can use is 256. This limitation seemed reasonable when GIF was developed because few people could afford the hardware to display more colors simultaneously. Simple graphics, line drawings, cartoons, and grey-scale photographs typically need fewer than 256 colors.\n\nEach frame can designate one index as a \"transparent background color\": any pixel assigned this index takes on the color of the pixel in the same position from the background, which may have been determined by a previous frame of animation.\n\nMany techniques, collectively called [[dithering]], have been developed to approximate a wider range of colors with a small color palette by using pixels of two or more colors to approximate in-between colors. These techniques sacrifice spatial resolution to approximate deeper color resolution. While not part of the GIF specification, dithering can be used in images subsequently encoded as GIF images. This is often not an ideal solution for GIF images, both because the loss of spatial resolution typically makes an image look fuzzy on the screen, and because the dithering patterns often interfere with the compressibility of the image data, working against GIF's main purpose.\n\nIn the early days of graphical web browsers{{when|date=March 2015}}, graphics cards with 8-bit buffers (allowing only 256 colors) were common and it was fairly common to make GIF images using the [[Web-safe colors|websafe palette]].{{according_to_whom|date=March 2015}} This ensured predictable display, but severely limited the choice of colors. When 24-bit color became the norm palettes could instead be populated with the optimum colors for individual images.\n\nA small color table may suffice for small images, and keeping the color table small allows the file to be downloaded faster. Both the 87a and 89a specifications allow color tables of 2<sup>''n''</sup> colors for any ''n'' from 1 through 8. Most graphics applications will read and display GIF images with any of these table sizes; but some do not support all sizes when ''creating'' images. Tables of 2, 16, and 256 colors are widely supported.\n\n===True color===\n[[File:SmallFullColourGIF.gif|thumb|right|210px|An animated GIF illustrating a technique for displaying more than the typical limit of 256 colors]]\nAlthough GIF is almost never used for [[color depth#True color (24-bit)|true color]] images, it is possible to do so.<ref name=aminet>{{cite web |url=http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |title=GIF 24 Bit (truecolor) extensions |author=Andreas Kleinert |year=2007 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316215949/http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |archive-date=16 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=philhoward>{{cite web |url=http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |title=True-Color GIF Example |author=Philip Howard |accessdate=23 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222123613/http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |archive-date=22 February 2015}}</ref> A GIF image can include multiple image blocks, each of which can have its own 256-color palette, and the blocks can be tiled to create a complete image. Alternatively, the GIF89a specification introduced the idea of a \"transparent\" color where each image block can include its own palette of 255 visible colors plus one transparent color. A complete image can be created by layering image blocks with the visible portion of each layer showing through the transparent portions of the layers above.\n\nTo render a full-color image as a GIF, the original image must be broken down into smaller regions having no more than 255 or 256 different colors. Each of these regions is then stored as a separate image block with its own local palette and when the image blocks are displayed together (either by tiling or by layering partially transparent image blocks) the complete, full-color image appears. For example, breaking an image into tiles of 16 by 16 pixels (256 pixels in total) ensures that no tile has more than the local palette limit of 256 colors, although larger tiles may be used and similar colors merged resulting in some loss of color information.<ref name=aminet />\n\nSince each image block requires its own local color table, a GIF file having lots of image blocks can be very large, limiting the usefulness of full-color GIFs.<ref name=philhoward /> Additionally, not all GIF rendering programs handle tiled or layered images correctly. Many rendering programs interpret tiles or layers as animation frames and display them in sequence as an endless animation<ref name=aminet /> with most web browsers automatically displaying the frames with a delay time of 0.1 seconds or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nullsleep.tumblr.com/post/16524517190/animated-gif-minimum-frame-delay-browser-compatibility|title=Nullsleep - Jeremiah Johnson - Animated GIF Minimum Frame Delay Browser Compatibility Study|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.fenrir-inc.com/us/2012/02/theyre-different-how-to-match-the-animation-rate-of-gif-files-accross-browsers.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201034945/http://blog.fenrir-inc.com/us/2012/02/theyre-different-how-to-match-the-animation-rate-of-gif-files-accross-browsers.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 February 2017|title=They're different!

The pixel codes typically don't match the 8-bit size of the bytes, so the codes are packed into bytes by a \"little-Endian\" scheme: the least significant bit of the first code is stored in the least significant bit of the first byte, higher order bits of the code into higher order bits of the byte, spilling over into the low order bits of the next byte as necessary. Each subsequent code is stored starting at the least significant bit not already used.\n\nThis byte stream is stored in the file as a series of \"sub-blocks\".

A local string accumulates pixel color numbers from the palette, with no output action as long as the local string can be found in a code table. There is special treatment of the first two pixels that arrive before the table grows from its initial size by additions of strings. After each output code, the local string is initialized to the latest pixel color (that could not be included in the output code).\n<pre>\n                          Table           9-bit\n                     string --> code      code    Action\n                          #0 | 000h               Initialize root table of 9-bit codes\n                    palette  |  :\n                     colors  |  :\n                        #255 | 0FFh\n                         clr | 100h\n                         end | 101h\n                             |            100h     Clear\nPixel          Local         |\ncolor Palette  string        |\nBLACK  #40     28            |            028h     1st pixel always to output\nWHITE  #255    FF            |                     String found in table\n                  28 FF      | 102h                Always add 1st string to table\n               FF            |                     Initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String not found in table\n                             |            0FFh     - output code for previous string\n                  FF FF      | 103h                - add latest string to table\n               FF            |                     - initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\nBLACK  #40     FF FF 28      |                     String not found in table\n                             |            103h     - output code for previous string\n                  FF FF 28   | 104h                - add latest string to table\n               28            |                     - initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    28 FF         |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    28 FF FF      |                     String not found in table\n                             |            102h     - output code for previous string\n                  28 FF FF   | 105h                - add latest string to table\n               FF            |                     - initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String not found in table\n                             |            103h     - output code for previous string\n                  FF FF FF   | 106h                - add latest string to table\n               FF            |                     - initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    FF FF FF FF   |                     String not found in table\n                             |            106h     - output code for previous string\n                  FF FF FF FF| 107h                - add latest string to table\n               FF            |                     - initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    FF FF FF FF   |                     String found in table\n                                                   No more pixels\n                                          107h     - output code for last string\n                                          101h     End\n</pre>\nFor clarity the table is shown above as being built of strings of increasing length. That scheme can function but the table consumes an unpredictable amount of memory. Memory can be saved in practice by noting that each new string to be stored consists of a previously stored string augmented by one character. It is economical to store at each address only two words: an existing address and one character.\n\nThe LZW algorithm requires a search of the table for each pixel. A linear search through up to 4096 addresses would make the coding slow. In practice the codes can be stored in order of numerical value; this allows each search to be done by a SAR (Successive Approximation Register, as used in some [[Successive approximation ADC|ADCs]]), with only 12 magnitude comparisons. For this efficiency an extra table is needed to convert between codes and actual memory addresses; the extra table upkeeping is needed only when a new code is stored which happens at much less than pixel rate.\n\n===Image decoding===\nDecoding begins by mapping the stored bytes back to 9-bit codes. These are decoded to recover the pixel colors as shown below. A table identical to the one used in the encoder is built by adding strings by this rule:\n Is incoming code found in table?\n  YES: add string for local code followed by first byte of string for incoming code\n  NO: add string for local code followed by copy of its own first byte\n<pre>\n      shift\n9-bit ----> Local      Table                 Pixel\ncode        code   code --> string   Palette color  Action\n100h               000h  | #0                       Initialize root table of 9-bit codes\n                    :    | palette\n                    :    | colors\n                   0FFh  | #255\n                   100h  | clr\n                   101h  | end\n028h                     |             #40    BLACK Decode 1st pixel\n0FFh        028h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                         |             #255   WHITE  - output string from table\n                   102h  | 28 FF                     - add to table\n103h        0FFh         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                   103h  | FF FF                     - add to table\n                         |                           - output string from table\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n102h        103h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                         |                           - output string from table\n                         |             #40    BLACK\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                   104h  | FF FF 28                  - add to table\n103h        102h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                         |                           - output string from table\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                   105h  | 28 FF FF                  - add to table\n106h        103h         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                   106h  | FF FF FF                  - add to table\n                         |                           - output string from table\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n107h        106h         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                   107h  | FF FF FF FF               - add to table\n                         |                           - output string from table\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n101h                     |                           End\n\n</pre>\n\n===LZW code lengths===\nShorter code lengths can be used for palettes smaller than the 256 colors in the example. If the palette is only 64 colors (so color indexes are 6 bits wide), the symbols can range from 0 to 63, and the symbol width can be taken to be 6 bits, with codes starting at 7 bits. In fact, the symbol width need not match the palette size: as long as the values decoded are always less than the number of colors in the palette, the symbols can be any width from 2 to 8, and the palette size any power of 2 from 2 to 256. For example, if only the first four colors (values 0 to 3) of the palette are used, the symbols can be taken to be 2 bits wide with codes starting at 3 bits.\n\nConversely, the symbol width could be set at 8, even if only values 0 and 1 are used; these data would only require a 2-color table. Although there would be no point in encoding the file that way, something similar typically happens for bi-color images: the minimum symbol width is 2, even if only values 0 and 1 are used.\n\nThe code table initially contains codes that are one bit longer than the symbol size in order to accommodate the two special codes ''clr'' and ''end'' and codes for strings that are added during the process. When the table is full the code length increases to give space for more strings, up to a maximum code 4095 = FFF(hex). As the decoder builds its table it tracks these increases in code length and it is able to unpack incoming bytes accordingly.\n\n===Uncompressed GIF===\n[[File:Quilt design as 46x46 uncompressed GIF.gif|thumb|\nA 46 x 46 uncompressed GIF with 7-bit symbols (128 colors, 8-bit codes). Click on the image for an explanation of the code.]]\nThe GIF encoding process can be modified to create a file without LZW compression that is still viewable as a GIF image. This technique was introduced originally as a way to avoid patent infringement. Uncompressed GIF can also be a useful intermediate format for a graphics programmer because individual pixels are accessible for reading or painting. An uncompressed GIF file can be converted to an ordinary GIF file simply by passing it through an image editor.\n\nThe modified encoding method ignores building the LZW table and emits only the root palette codes and the codes for CLEAR and STOP. This yields a simpler encoding (a 1-to-1 correspondence between code values and palette codes) but sacrifices all of the compression: each pixel in the image generates an output code indicating its color index. When processing an uncompressed GIF, a standard GIF decoder will not be prevented from writing strings to its dictionary table, but the code width must never increase since that triggers a different packing of bits to bytes.\n\nIf the symbol width is n, the codes of width n+1 fall naturally into two blocks: the lower block of 2<sup>n</sup> codes for coding single symbols, and the upper block of 2<sup>n</sup> codes that will be used by the decoder for sequences of length greater than one. Of that upper block, the first two codes are already taken: 2<sup>n</sup> for CLEAR and 2<sup>n</sup> + 1 for STOP. The decoder must also be prevented from using the last code in the upper block, 2<sup>n+1</sup> \u2212 1, because when the decoder fills that slot, it will increase the code width. Thus in the upper block there are 2<sup>n</sup> \u2212 3 codes available to the decoder that won't trigger an increase in code width. Because the decoder is always one step behind in maintaining the table, it does not generate a table entry upon receiving the first code from the encoder, but will generate one for each succeeding code. Thus the encoder can generate 2<sup>n</sup> \u2212 2 codes without triggering an increase in code width. Therefore the encoder must emit extra CLEAR codes at intervals of 2<sup>n</sup> \u2212 2 codes or less to make the decoder reset the coding dictionary. The GIF standard allows such extra CLEAR codes to be inserted in the image data at any time.

A block of image data begins with a byte that declares the number of bytes to follow. The last block of data for an image is marked by a zero block-length byte.\n\n== Interlacing ==\nThe GIF Specification allows each image within the logical screen of a GIF file to specify that it is interlaced; i.e., that the order of the raster lines in its data block is not sequential. This allows a partial display of the image that can be recognized before the full image is painted.\n\nAn interlaced image is divided from top to bottom into strips 8 pixels high, and the rows of the image are presented in the following order:\n\n* Pass 1: Line 0 (the top-most line) from each strip.\n* Pass 2: Line 4 from each strip.\n* Pass 3: Lines 2 and 6 from each strip.\n* Pass 4: Lines 1, 3, 5, and 7 from each strip.\n\nThe pixels within each line are not interlaced, but presented consecutively from left to right. As with non-interlaced images, there is no break between the data for one line and the data for the next. The indicator that an image is interlaced is a bit set in the image's header block.\n\n==Animated GIF==\n{{Missing information|section|the accessibility problems, why most browsers enable animated GIFs, and how users can block animated GIFs|date=May 2015}}\n\n<!--OTRS [[Ticket:2014021510009504]] gives permission for references to some GIFs, and code here.

An animated GIF file comprises a number of frames that are displayed in succession, each introduced by its own GCE, which gives the time delay to wait after the frame is drawn. Global information at the start of the file applies by default to all frames. The data is stream-oriented, so the file-offset of the start of each GCE depends on the length of preceding data. Within each frame the LZW-coded image data is arranged in sub-blocks of up to 255 bytes; the size of each sub-block is declared by the byte that precedes it.\n\nBy default, however, an animation displays the sequence of frames only once, stopping when the last frame is displayed. Since GIF is designed to allow users to define new blocks, [[Netscape]] in the 1990s used the Application Extension block (intended to allow vendors to add application-specific information to the GIF file) to implement the Netscape Application Block (NAB).<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www6.uniovi.es/gifanim/gifabout.htm\n |title=All About GIF89a\n |author=Royal Frazier\n |accessdate=7 January 2013\n}}</ref> This block, placed immediately before all the animation frames, specifies the number of times the sequence of frames should be played. (The value 0 signifies continuous display.) Support for these repeating animations first appeared in [[Netscape Navigator]] version 2.0, and then spread to other browsers.<ref>\n{{cite book |isbn=0-7897-0947-3\n |title=Web Scripting Secret Weapons\n |author=Scott Walter |publisher=[[Que Publishing]] |year=1996\n}}</ref> Most browsers now recognize and support NAB, though it is not strictly part of the GIF89a specification.\n\nThe following example shows the structure of the animation file ''[[:File:Rotating earth (large).gif|Rotating earth (large).gif]]'' shown (as a thumbnail) at the top of the article.\n{{clear}}\n\n<pre>\nbyte#  hexadecimal  text or\n(hex)               value     Meaning\n0:     47 49 46\n       38 39 61     GIF89a    Header\n                              Logical Screen Descriptor\n6:     90 01        400        - width in pixels\n8:     90 01        400        - height in pixels\nA:     F7                      - GCT follows for 256 colors with resolution 3 x 8bits/primary\nB:     00           0          - background color #0\nC:     00                      - default pixel aspect ratio\nD:                            Global Color Table\n:\n30D:   21 FF                  Application Extension block\n30F:   0B           11         - eleven bytes of data follow\n310:   4E 45 54\n       53 43 41\n       50 45        NETSCAPE   - 8-character application name\n       32 2E 30     2.0        - application \"authentication code\"\n31B:   03           3          - three more bytes of data\n31C:   01           1          - data sub-block index (always 1)\n31D:   FF FF        65535      - unsigned number of repetitions\n31F:   00                      - end of App Extension block\n320:   21 F9                  Graphic Control Extension for frame #1\n322:   04           4          - four bytes of data follow\n323:   08                      - bit-fields 3x:3:1:1, 000|010|0|0 -> Restore to bg color\n324:   09 00                   - 0.09 sec delay before painting next frame\n326:   00                      - no transparent color\n327:   00                      - end of GCE block\n328:   2C                     Image Descriptor\n329:   00 00 00 00  (0,0)      - NW corner of frame at 0, 0\n32D:   90 01 90 01  (400,400)  - Frame width and height: 400 x 400\n331:   00                      - no local color table; no interlace\n332:   08           8         LZW min code size\n333:   FF           255       - 255 bytes of LZW encoded image data follow\n334:                data\n433:   FF           255       - 255 bytes of LZW encoded image data follow\n                    data\n                     :\n92BA:  00                    - end of LZW data for this frame\n92BB:  21 F9                 Graphic Control Extension for frame #2\n :                                                            :\n153B7B:21 F9                 Graphic Control Extension for frame #44\n :\n15CF35:3B                    File terminator\n</pre>\nThe animation delay for each frame is specified in the GCE in hundredths of a second. Some economy of data is possible where a frame need only rewrite a portion of the pixels of the display, because the Image Descriptor can define a smaller rectangle to be rescanned instead of the whole image. Browsers or other displays that do not support animated GIFs typically show only the first frame.\n\nThe size and color quality of animated GIF files can vary significantly depending on the application used to create them. Strategies for minimizing file size include using a common global color table for all frames (rather than a complete local color table for each frame) and minimizing the number of pixels covered in successive frames (so that only the pixels that change from one frame to the next are included in the latter frame). Simply packing a series of independent frame images into a composite animation tends to yield large file sizes.\n\n[[Internet Explorer]] slows down GIFs if the frame-rate is 20 frames per second or higher and Microsoft reports that [[Google Chrome]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] also slow down some GIF animations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/06/08/animated-gifs-slow-down-to-under-20-frames-per-second.aspx|title=MSDN Blogs|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nStarting in early 1995, the [[University of Ulm]] used animated GIF as live video streaming format to show a controllable model railroad.\n\n== Metadata ==\nMetadata can be stored in GIF files as a comment block, a plain text block, or an application-specific application extension block.  Several graphics editors use unofficial application extension blocks to include the data used to generate the image, so that it can be recovered for further editing.\n\nAll of these methods technically require the metadata to be broken into sub-blocks so that applications can navigate the metadata block without knowing its internal structure.\n\nThe [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) metadata standard introduced an unofficial but now widespread \"XMP Data\" application extension block for including XMP data in GIF files.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/xmp/pdfs/XMP%20SDK%20Release%20cc-2016-08/XMPSpecificationPart3.pdf |title=XMP Specification Part 3: Storage In Files |last= |first= |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Adobe |pages=11\u201312 |access-date=16 August 2018 |quote=}}</ref>. Since the XMP data is encoded using [[UTF-8]] without NUL characters, there are no 0 bytes in the data. Rather than break the data into formal sub-blocks, the extension block terminates with a \"magic trailer\" that routes any application treating the data as sub-blocks to a final 0 byte that terminates the sub-block chain.\n\n== Unisys and LZW patent enforcement ==<!-- This section is linked from PNG -->\nIn 1977 and 1978, [[Jacob Ziv]] and [[Abraham Lempel]] published a pair of papers on a new class of lossless data-compression algorithms, now collectively referred to as [[LZ77 and LZ78]].

At the time, CompuServe was not aware of the patent.<ref name=\"PNG\" /> Unisys became aware that the version of GIF used the LZW compression technique and entered into licensing negotiations with CompuServe in January 1993. The subsequent agreement was announced on 24 December 1994.<ref name=\"KYZ\" /> Unisys stated that they expected all major commercial on-line information services companies employing the LZW patent to license the technology from Unisys at a reasonable rate, but that they would not require licensing, or fees to be paid, for non-commercial, non-profit GIF-based applications, including those for use on the on-line services.<ref name=\"LPF\" />\n\nFollowing this announcement, there was widespread condemnation of CompuServe and Unisys, and many software developers threatened to stop using GIF.

His father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a [[Recusancy|recusant]] Catholic. Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for mainland Europe, where he fought for Catholic Spain in the [[Eighty Years' War]] against Protestant Dutch [[Protestant Reformation|reformers]] in the [[Low Countries]]. He travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England without success. He later met [[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Thomas Wintour]], with whom he returned to England.\n\nWintour introduced Fawkes to [[Robert Catesby]], who planned to assassinate {{nowrap|[[James VI and I|King James I]]}} and restore a Catholic monarch to the throne. The plotters leased an [[undercroft]] beneath the [[House of Lords]], and Fawkes was placed in charge of the [[gunpowder]] they stockpiled there. Prompted by the receipt of an anonymous letter, the authorities searched [[Westminster Palace]] during the early hours of 5 November and found Fawkes guarding the explosives. Over the next few days, he was questioned and tortured and eventually confessed. Immediately before his execution on 31 January, Fawkes fell from the scaffold where he was to be hanged and broke his neck, thus avoiding the agony of the [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|mutilation]] that followed.\n\nFawkes became synonymous with the Gunpowder Plot, the failure of which has been [[Guy Fawkes Night|commemorated in Britain]] since 5 November 1605. His effigy is traditionally burned on a bonfire, commonly accompanied by [[fireworks]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:St Michael le Belfrey (21st October 2010) 001.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo|Fawkes was baptised at the church of [[St Michael le Belfrey]] next to [[York Minster]] (seen at left).]]\nGuy Fawkes was born in 1570 in Stonegate, [[York]].

His mother remarried several years later, to the Catholic Dionis Baynbrigge (or Denis Bainbridge) of [[Scotton, Harrogate]].

A governor of the school had spent about 20&nbsp;years in prison for recusancy, and its headmaster, John Pulleyn, came from a family of noted Yorkshire recusants, the Pulleyns of [[Blubberhouses]].  In her 1915 work ''The Pulleynes of Yorkshire'', author Catharine Pullein suggested that Fawkes's Catholic education came from his Harrington relatives, who were known for harbouring priests, one of whom later accompanied Fawkes to [[Flanders]] in 1592\u20131593.<ref name=\"Herber\"/>  Fawkes's fellow students included [[John and Christopher Wright|John Wright]] and his brother [[Christopher Wright (plotter)|Christopher]] (both later involved with Fawkes in the [[Gunpowder Plot]]) and [[Oswald Tesimond]], [[Edward Oldcorne]] and Robert Middleton, who became priests (the latter executed in 1601).{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=84\u201385|ps=}}\n\nAfter leaving school Fawkes entered the service of [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu]].<!-- Browne was one of the leading statesmen during the time of Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and was also allegedly implicated in the [[Ridolfi plot]] -->  The Viscount took a dislike to Fawkes and after a short time dismissed him; he was subsequently employed by [[Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu]], who succeeded his grandfather at the age of&nbsp;18.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=85\u201386|ps=}} At least one source claims that Fawkes married and had a son, but no known contemporary accounts confirm this.<ref name=\"Fraserp86\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=86}}</ref>{{efn|According to the [[International Genealogical Index]], compiled by the [[Family History Library|LDS Church]], Fawkes married Maria Pulleyn (b. 1569) in Scotton in 1590, and had a son, Thomas, on 6 February 1591.<ref name=\"Herber\">{{citation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617064347/http://www.gunpowder-plot.org/news/1998_04/gfmp.htm |archivedate=17 June 2011 |url=http://www.gunpowder-plot.org/news/1998_04/gfmp.htm |publisher=The Gunpowder Plot Society |contribution=The Marriage of Guy Fawkes and Maria Pulleyn |title=The Gunpowder Plot Society Newsletter |issue= 1 |date=April 1998 |last=Herber |first=David |accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref> These entries, however, appear to derive from a secondary source and not from actual parish entries.<ref name=\"Fraserp86\"/>}}<!-- After renting them out for a while as a way to earn money, he sold his stakes in them to Anne Skipsey.{{fact|date=November 2010}} -->\n\n===Military career===\nIn October 1591 Fawkes sold the estate in [[Clifton, York|Clifton]] in York that he had inherited from his father.{{efn|Although the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography claims 1592, multiple alternative sources give 1591 as the date.

Although the information he provided to Salisbury usually amounted to no more than a vague pattern of invasion reports, and included nothing which regarded the Gunpowder Plot, on 21 April he told how Fawkes was to be brought by Tesimond to England.  Fawkes was a well-known Flemish mercenary, and would be introduced to \"Mr Catesby\" and \"honourable friends of the nobility and others who would have arms and horses in readiness\".{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=150|ps=}}  Turner's report did not, however, mention Fawkes's pseudonym in England, John Johnson, and did not reach Cecil until late in November, well after the plot had been discovered.<ref name=\"ODNB Fawkes\"/>{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=148\u2013150|ps=}}\n\nIt is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August 1605, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed.  More gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=170|ps=}}  Fawkes's final role in the plot was settled during a series of meetings in October.  He was to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames.  Simultaneously, a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth.  Acts of [[regicide]] were frowned upon, and Fawkes would therefore head to [[Continental Europe|the continent]], where he would explain to the Catholic powers his holy duty to kill the King and his retinue.<ref name=\"Fraser 1999 178\u2013179\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=178\u2013179}}</ref>\n\n===Discovery===\n[[File:Guy fawkes henry perronet briggs.jpg|thumb|alt=In a stone-walled room, several armed men physically restrain another man, who is drawing his sword.|''Discovery of the Gunpowder Plot'' (c.&nbsp;1823), [[Henry Perronet Briggs]]]]\nA few of the conspirators were concerned about fellow Catholics who would be present at Parliament during the opening.{{sfn|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=62\u201363|ps=}}  On the evening of 26 October, [[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle|Lord Monteagle]] received an anonymous letter warning him to stay away, and to \"retyre youre self into yowre contee whence yow maye expect the event in safti for&nbsp;... they shall receyve a terrible blowe this parleament\".{{sfn|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=68\u201369|ps=}} Despite quickly becoming aware of the letter{{spaced ndash}}informed by one of Monteagle's servants{{spaced ndash}}the conspirators resolved to continue with their plans, as it appeared that it \"was clearly thought to be a hoax\".{{sfn|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=72|ps=}}   Fawkes checked the undercroft on 30 October, and reported that nothing had been disturbed.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=189|ps=}}  Monteagle's suspicions had been aroused, however, and the letter was shown to King James. The King ordered [[Thomas Knyvet, 1st Baron Knyvet|Sir Thomas Knyvet]] to conduct a search of the cellars underneath Parliament, which he did in the early hours of 5 November.  Fawkes had taken up his station late on the previous night, armed with a slow match and a watch given to him by Percy \"becaus he should knowe howe the time went away\".<ref name=\"ODNB Fawkes\"/>  He was found leaving the cellar, shortly after midnight, and arrested.  Inside, the barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of firewood and coal.{{sfn|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=73|ps=}}\n\n===Torture===\nFawkes gave his name as John Johnson and was first interrogated by members of the King's [[Privy chamber]], where he remained defiant.<ref name=\"NorthcoteParkinsonpp9192\">{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=91\u201392}}</ref>  When asked by one of the lords what he was doing in possession of so much gunpowder, Fawkes answered that his intention was \"to blow you Scotch beggars back to your native mountains.\" {{sfn|Cobbett|1857|p=229}} He identified himself as a 36-year-old Catholic from Netherdale in Yorkshire, and gave his father's name as Thomas and his mother's as Edith Jackson.  Wounds on his body noted by his questioners he explained as the effects of [[pleurisy]].  Fawkes admitted his intention to blow up the House of Lords, and expressed regret at his failure to do so.  His steadfast manner earned him the admiration of King James, who described Fawkes as possessing \"a Roman resolution\".{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=208\u2013209|ps=}}\n\nJames's admiration did not, however, prevent him from ordering on 6 November that \"John Johnson\" be tortured, to reveal the names of his co-conspirators.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=211|ps=}}  He directed that the torture be light at first, referring to the use of [[handcuffs|manacles]], but more severe if necessary, authorising the use of [[Rack (torture)|the rack]]: \"the gentler Tortures are to be first used unto him ''et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur'' [and so by degrees proceeding to the worst]\".<ref name=\"NorthcoteParkinsonpp9192\"/>{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=215|ps=}}  Fawkes was transferred to the [[Tower of London]].  The King composed a list of questions to be put to \"Johnson\", such as \"''as to what he is'', For I can never yet hear of any man that knows him\", \"When and where he learned to speak French?\", and \"If he was a Papist, who brought him up in it?\"{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=212|ps=}} The room in which Fawkes was interrogated subsequently became known as the Guy Fawkes Room.{{sfn|Younghusband|2008|p=46|ps=}}\n\n[[File:Guy fawkes torture signatures.jpg|thumb|alt=Two signatures|Fawkes's signature of \"Guido\", made soon after his torture, is a barely evident scrawl compared to a later instance.]]\n[[William Wade (English politician)|Sir William Waad]], Lieutenant of the Tower, supervised the torture and obtained Fawkes's confession.<ref name=\"NorthcoteParkinsonpp9192\"/>  He searched his prisoner, and found a letter addressed to Guy Fawkes.

According to Waad, Fawkes managed to rest through the night, despite his being warned that he would be interrogated until \"I had gotton the inwards secret of his thoughts and all his complices\".{{sfn|Bengsten|2005|p=59|ps=}} His composure was broken at some point during the following day.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=216\u2013217|ps=}}\n\nThe observer Sir Edward Hoby remarked \"Since Johnson's being in the Tower, he beginneth to speak English\".

He began to reveal their names on 8 November, and told how they intended to place Princess Elizabeth on the throne.  His third confession, on 9 November, implicated [[Francis Tresham]]. Following the [[Ridolfi plot]] of 1571 prisoners were made to dictate their confessions, before copying and signing them, if they still could.{{sfn|Bengsten|2005|p=60|ps=}} Although it is uncertain if he was tortured on the rack, Fawkes's scrawled signature bears testament to the suffering he endured at the hands of his interrogators.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=215\u2013216, 228\u2013229|ps=}}\n\n===Trial and execution===\nThe trial of eight of the plotters began on Monday 27 January 1606.

The last piece of evidence offered was a conversation between Fawkes and Wintour, who had been kept in adjacent cells.  The two men apparently thought they had been speaking in private, but their conversation was intercepted by a government spy.  When the prisoners were allowed to speak, Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=269\u2013271|ps=none}}\n\nOn 31 January 1606, Fawkes and three others&nbsp;\u2013 Thomas Wintour, [[Ambrose Rookwood]], and Robert Keyes&nbsp;\u2013 were dragged (''i.e.'', \"drawn\") from the Tower on wattled [[hurdle]]s to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster, opposite the building they had attempted to destroy.{{sfn|Haynes|2005|pp=115\u2013116|ps=}}  His fellow plotters were then [[hanged and quartered]].  Fawkes was the last to stand on the scaffold.  He asked for forgiveness of the King and state, while keeping up his \"crosses and idle ceremonies\" (Catholic practices).  Weakened by torture and aided by the hangman, Fawkes began to climb the ladder to the noose, but either through jumping to his death or climbing too high so the rope was incorrectly set, he managed to avoid the agony of the latter part of his execution by breaking his neck.<ref name=\"NorthcoteParkinsonpp9192\"/>{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=283|ps=}}{{sfn|Sharpe|2005|pp=76\u201377|ps=}} His lifeless body was nevertheless quartered{{sfn|Allen|1973|p=37|ps=}} and, as was the custom,{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=102|ps=}} his body parts were then distributed to \"the four corners of the kingdom\", to be displayed as a warning to other would-be traitors.<ref>{{citation |title=Guy Fawkes |publisher=York Museums Trust |url=http://www.historyofyork.org.uk//themes/tudor-stuart/guy-fawkes |accessdate=16 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414012842/http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/tudor-stuart/guy-fawkes |archive-date=14 April 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{See also|Gunpowder Plot in popular culture}}\n[[File:Procession of a guy.jpg|thumb|alt=Sketch of a group of children escorting an effigy|''Procession of a Guy'' (1864)]]\n[[File:(Guy Fawkes night at Chirk) (6302836170).jpg|thumb|Children preparing for Guy Fawkes night celebrations  (1954)]]\nOn 5 November 1605 Londoners were encouraged to celebrate the King's escape from assassination by lighting bonfires, \"always provided that 'this testemonye of joy be carefull done without any danger or disorder{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"ODNB Fawkes\"/>  [[Observance of 5th November Act 1605|An Act of Parliament]] designated each 5 November as a day of thanksgiving for \"the joyful day of deliverance\", and remained in force until 1859.<ref name=\"factsheet\">{{citation|author=House of Commons Information Office |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/g08.pdf |title=The Gunpowder Plot |publisher=parliament.uk at web.archive.org |date=September 2006 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215195506/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/g08.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2005 }}</ref> Although he was only one of 13&nbsp;conspirators, Fawkes is today the individual most associated with the failed plot.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=349|ps=}}\n\nIn Britain, 5 November has variously been called [[Guy Fawkes Night]], Guy Fawkes Day, Plot Night{{sfn|Fox| Woolf|2002|p=269|ps=}} and Bonfire Night; the latter can be traced directly back to the original celebration of 5 November 1605.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=351\u2013352|ps=}} Bonfires were accompanied by fireworks from the 1650s onwards, and it became the custom to burn an effigy (usually the pope) after 1673, when the heir presumptive, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], made his conversion to Catholicism public.<ref name=\"ODNB Fawkes\"/>  Effigies of other notable figures who have become targets for the public's ire, such as [[Paul Kruger]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], have also found their way onto the bonfires,{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=356|ps=}} although most modern effigies are of Fawkes.<ref name=\"factsheet\"/> The \"guy\" is normally created by children, from old clothes, newspapers, and a mask.<ref name=\"factsheet\"/>  During the 19th century, \"guy\" came to mean an oddly dressed person, but in [[American English]] it lost any pejorative connotation, and was used to refer to any male person.<ref name=\"factsheet\"/><ref name=\"mw\">{{citation |title=The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories |last=Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1991 |isbn=0-87779-603-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrcZEZ1bOJsC&pg=PA208|page=208}}, entry \"guy\"</ref>\n\nJames Sharpe, professor of history at the University of York, has described how Guy Fawkes came to be toasted as \"the last man to enter Parliament with honest intentions\".{{sfn|Sharpe|2005|p=6|ps=}}\n\n[[William Harrison Ainsworth]]'s 1841 historical romance ''[[Guy Fawkes (novel)|Guy Fawkes; or, The Gunpowder Treason]]'' portrays Fawkes in a generally sympathetic light,<ref>{{citation |last=Harrison Ainsworth |first=William |authorlink=William Harrison Ainsworth |title=Guy Fawkes; or, The Gunpowder Treason |publisher=Nottingham Society |year=1841 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=YvcOOnJWc3gC&dq=william+harrison+ainsworth+fawkes&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=eDgfrpTV3h&sig=Wvzti1wdj7OSYbKLCi08P83pAQ0}}</ref> and transformed him in the public perception into an \"acceptable fictional character\".

Warnings about a computer virus named \"Good Times\" began being passed around among Internet users in 1994. The Goodtimes virus was supposedly transmitted via an [[email]] bearing the subject header \"Good Times\" or \"Goodtimes,\" hence the virus's name, and the warning recommended deleting any such email unread.  The virus described in the warnings did not exist, but the warnings themselves, were, in effect, virus-like.  In 1997 the [[Cult of the Dead Cow]] hacker collective announced that they had been responsible for the perpetration of the \"Good Times\" virus hoax as an exercise to \"prove the gullibility of self-proclaimed 'experts' on the Internet.\"<ref>[http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/update21.html cDc Paramedia Global Domination Update #21]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first recorded email warnings about the Good Times virus showed up on 15 November 1994.<ref>[http://fgouget.free.fr/goodtimes/goodtimes.html Good Times Virus Hoax FAQ, dated 12 December 1998, last retrieved on 13 March 2008]</ref> The first message was brief, a simple five sentence email with a Christmas greeting, advising recipients not to open email messages with subject \"GOOD TIMES!!\", as doing so would ruin their files.   Later messages became more intricate.  The most common versions\u2014the \"[[Infinite loop]]\" and \"[[ASCII buffer]]\" editions\u2014were much longer, containing descriptions of what exactly Good Times would do to the computer of someone who opened it, as well as comparisons to other viruses of the time, and references to a U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] warning.\n\n==Sample Goodtimes Email==\n<blockquote>FYI, a file, going under the name \u201cGood Times\u201d is being sent to some Internet users who subscribe to on-line services (Compuserve, Prodigy and America On Line). If you should receive this file, do not download it! Delete it immediately. I understand that there is a virus included in that file, which if downloaded to your personal computer, will ruin all of your files.</blockquote>\n\n==Purported effects==\nThe longer version of the Good Times warning contained descriptions of what Good Times was supposedly capable of doing to computers.   In addition to sending itself to every email address in a recipient's received or sent mail, the Good Times virus caused a wide variety of other nasty things to happen. For example, one version said that if an infected computer contained a hard drive, it could be destroyed.  If Good Times was not stopped in time, an infected computer would enter an \"nth-complexity infinite binary loop\" (a meaningless term), damaging the processor.   The \"ASCII\" buffer email described the mechanism of Good Times as a [[buffer overflow]].\n\n==Hoaxes similar to Good Times==\nA number of [[List of computer virus hoaxes|computer virus hoaxes]] appeared in the wake of Good Times.   These messages were similar in form to Good Times, warning users not to open messages bearing particular subject lines. Subject lines mentioned in these emails include \"Penpal greetings,\"<ref>[http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/penpal.html Symantec.com - Penpal Greetings description.

Perhaps best known as a poet (often associated with the Beat Generation and the [[San Francisco Renaissance]]), he is also an essayist, lecturer, and [[environmentalism|environmental activist]]. He has been described as the \"poet laureate of [[Deep ecology|Deep Ecology]]\".<ref>Petr Kopeck\u00fd, \"Nature Writing in American Literature: Inspirations, Interrelations, and Impacts of California Authors on the Deep Ecology Movement\" ''The Trumpeter'', Volume 22, Number 2 (2006) {{ISSN|0832-6193}} \"[George] Sessions' numerous references to Snyder have not passed unnoticed by other scholars. He \nIs also a drunk. In his influential study The Idea of Wilderness (1991), Max Oelschlaeger titled the section on Snyder 'Poet Laureate of Deep Ecology.' What is even more striking is that in the footnote, Oelschlaeger confesses that 'Sessions in particular has influenced me to see and read Snyder as the poet laureate of deep ecology.'\"\n</ref> Snyder is a winner of a [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] and the [[American Book Awards|American Book Award]]. His work, in his various roles, reflects an immersion in both [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] spirituality and nature. Snyder has translated literature into English from ancient Chinese and modern Japanese. Snyder was an academic at the [[University of California, Davis]] and a member of the [[California Arts Council]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\nGary Sherman Snyder was born in [[San Francisco, California]] to Harold and Lois Hennessy Snyder. Snyder is of German, Scots-Irish, and English ancestry. His family, impoverished by the [[Great Depression]],<ref name = \"gtksnn\">[http://www.everyday-beat.org/everyday/essay/snyder/ Chapter 14: The Dharma Bum]</ref> moved to [[King County, Washington]],<ref>''Seattle Times'', 5-28-2009</ref> when he was two years old. There, they tended dairy cows, kept laying hens, had a small orchard, and made cedar-wood shingles,.<ref>Snyder, Gary (Sept/Oct 1984) \"Choosing Your Place-and Taking a Stand\" interview with G.S., ''The Mother Earth News'', p.89.</ref><ref>Snyder (2007) p. 61</ref> At the age of seven, Snyder was laid up for four months by an accident. \"So my folks brought me piles of books from the [[Seattle Public Library]],\" he recalled in interview, \"and it was then I really learned to read and from that time on was voracious \u2014 I figure that accident changed my life. At the end of four months, I had read more than most kids do by the time they're eighteen. And I didn't stop.\"<ref name = \"gtksnn\"/> Also during his ten childhood years in Washington, Snyder became aware of the presence of the Coast [[Salishan languages|Salish]] people and developed an interest in the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples in general and their traditional relationship with nature.<ref name = \"gtksnn\"/>\n\nIn 1942, following his parents' divorce, Snyder moved to [[Portland, Oregon]] with his mother and his younger sister, Anthea.<ref name=\"Suiter 54\">Suiter (2002) p 54</ref>  Their mother, Lois Snyder Hennessy (born Wilkey),<ref>Snyder (2007) p. 149</ref> worked during this period as a reporter for ''[[The Oregonian]]''. One of Gary's boyhood jobs was as a newspaper copy boy, also at the ''Oregonian''.<ref name=\"Suiter 54\"/>  Also, during his teen years, he attended [[Lincoln High School (Portland, Oregon)|Lincoln High School]],<ref name=\"Suiter 54\"/> worked as a camp counselor, and went mountain climbing with the [[Mazamas]] youth group.<ref>Halper, Jon (1991). ''Gary Snyder: Dimensions of a Life''. San Francisco: Sierra Club Books. {{ISBN|0-87156-616-8}}</ref> Climbing remained an interest of his, especially during his twenties and thirties.<ref name = \"gtksnn\"/> In 1947, he started attending [[Reed College]] on a scholarship.<ref Name = \"gtksnn\"/> Here he met, and for a time, roomed with the education author Carl Proujan; and became acquainted with [[Philip Whalen]] and [[Lew Welch]]. During his time at Reed, Snyder published his first poems in a student journal. In 1948, he spent the summer working as a seaman. To get this job, he joined the now defunct Marine Cooks and Stewards union,<ref>Suiter (2002) p. 87</ref> and would later work as a seaman in the mid-1950s to gain experience of other cultures in port cities. Snyder married Alison Gass in 1950; however, they separated after seven months, and divorced in 1952.<ref>Alison Murie</ref><ref name=\"Suiter 325\"/>\n\nWhile attending Reed, Snyder did folklore research on the [[Warm Springs Indian Reservation]] in [[central Oregon]].<ref name=reedmag08>{{cite news|title=Listening to Indians/Snyder goes logging|first=Robert E.|last=Moore|work=Reed magazine|date=Winter 2008|pages=14}}</ref> He graduated with a dual degree in [[anthropology]] and literature in 1951.<ref>Smith (1999) p. 10</ref> Snyder's senior thesis, entitled ''The Dimensions of a Myth'', employed perspectives from anthropology, folklore, psychology, and literature to examine a myth of the Pacific Northwest's Haida people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dimensions of a Myth|last=Snyder|first=Gary|publisher=Reed College|year=1951|isbn=|location=Reed College Library, Portland, Oregon, US|pages=1\u20134}}</ref> He spent the following few summers working as a timber scaler at Warm Springs, developing relationships with its people that were less rooted in academia.<ref name=reedmag08/> This experience formed the basis for some of his earliest published poems (including \"A Berry Feast\"),<ref name = \"gtksnn\"/> later collected in the book ''The Back Country''.  He also encountered the basic ideas of Buddhism and, through its arts, some of the Far East's traditional attitudes toward nature. He went to [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] with a graduate fellowship to study anthropology.<ref name = \"gtksnn\"/> (Snyder also began practicing self-taught [[Zen]] meditation.) He left after a single semester to return to San Francisco and to 'sink or swim as a poet'.<ref>Suiter (2002) p. 7</ref> Snyder worked for two summers in the [[North Cascades]] in Washington as a [[fire lookout]], on Crater Mountain in 1952 and Sourdough Mountain in 1953 (both locations on the upper [[Skagit River]]). His attempts to get another lookout stint in 1954 (at the peak of [[McCarthyism]]), however, failed. He had been barred from working for the government, due to his association with the Marine Cooks and Stewards.<ref>Suiter (2002) pp. 83\u201394</ref>  Instead, he went back to Warm Springs to work in [[cable logging|logging]] as a chokersetter (fastening cables to logs). This experience contributed to his ''Myths and Texts'' and the essay ''Ancient Forests of the Far West''.<ref>Suiter (2002) p. 104</ref>\n\n===The Beats===\nBack in San Francisco, Snyder lived with Whalen, who shared his growing interest in [[Zen Buddhism|Zen]]. Snyder's reading of the writings of [[D.T. Suzuki]] had in fact been a factor in his decision not to continue as a graduate-student in anthropology, and in 1953 he enrolled at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to study Asian culture and languages. He studied [[ink and wash painting]] under [[Chiura Obata]] and [[Tang Dynasty]] poetry under Ch'en Shih-hsiang.<ref>Suiter (2002) pp. 82\u201383</ref>  Snyder continued to spend summers working in the forests, including one summer as a trail-builder in Yosemite. He spent some months in 1955 and 1956 living in a cabin (which he dubbed \"Marin-an\") outside [[Mill Valley, California]] with [[Jack Kerouac]]. It was also at this time that Snyder was an occasional student at the American Academy of Asian Studies, where Sabur\u014d Hasegawa and [[Alan Watts]], among others, were teaching. Hasegawa introduced Snyder to the treatment of landscape painting as a meditative practice. This inspired Snyder to attempt something equivalent in poetry, and with Hasegawa's encouragement, he began work on ''Mountains and Rivers without End'', which would be completed and published forty years later.<ref>Suiter (2002) pp. 188\u2013189</ref>  During these years, Snyder was writing and collecting his own work, as well as embarking on the translation of the \"Cold Mountain\" poems by the 8th-century Chinese recluse Han Shan; this work appeared in chapbook-form in 1959, under the title ''Riprap & Cold Mountain Poems''.\n\nSnyder met [[Allen Ginsberg]] when the latter sought Snyder out on the recommendation of [[Kenneth Rexroth]].<ref>Fields, Rick (1981) ''How the Swans Came to the Lake'', p. 212. Boulder, CO: Shamballa.</ref> Then, through Ginsberg, Snyder and Kerouac came to know each other. This period provided the materials for Kerouac's novel ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', and Snyder was the inspiration for the novel's main character, Japhy Ryder, in the same way [[Neal Cassady]] had inspired Dean Moriarty in ''[[On the Road]]''. As the large majority of people in the Beat movement had urban backgrounds, writers like Ginsberg and Kerouac found Snyder, with his backcountry and manual-labor experience and interest in things rural, a refreshing and almost exotic individual. [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] later referred to Snyder as 'the Thoreau of the Beat Generation'.\n\nSnyder read his poem \"A Berry Feast\" at the [[Six Gallery reading|poetry reading at the Six Gallery]] in San Francisco (October 7, 1955) that heralded what was to become known as the [[San Francisco Renaissance]]. This also marked Snyder's first involvement with the Beats, although he was not a member of the original New York circle, but rather entered the scene through his association with Kenneth Rexroth. As recounted in Kerouac's ''Dharma Bums'', even at age 25 Snyder felt he could have a role in the fateful future meeting of West and East. Snyder's first book, ''Riprap'', which drew on his experiences as a forest lookout and on the trail-crew in Yosemite, was published in 1959.\n\n===Japan and India===\nIndependently, some of the Beats, including [[Philip Whalen]], had become interested in [[Zen]], but Snyder was one of the more serious scholars of the subject among them, preparing in every way he could think of for eventual study in Japan. In 1955, the [[First Zen Institute of America]] offered him a scholarship for a year of Zen training in Japan, but the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] refused to issue him a passport, informing him that \"it has been alleged you are a Communist.\"  A subsequent [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] ruling forced a change in policy, and Snyder got his passport.<ref>Suiter (2002) pp. 124\u2013125</ref>  In the end, his expenses were paid by [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki]], for whom he was supposed to work; but initially he served as personal attendant and English tutor<ref name=\"Stirling 83\">Stirling (2006) p. 83</ref> to Zen abbot Miura Isshu, at Rinko-in, a temple in [[Shokoku-ji]] in [[Kyoto]], where [[Dwight Goddard]] and [[R. H. Blyth]] had preceded him.<ref>Suiter (2002) pp. 192\u2013193</ref>  Mornings, after zazen, sutra chanting, and chores for Miura, he took Japanese classes, bringing his spoken Japanese up to a level sufficient for [[k\u014dan]] study. He developed a friendship with [[Philip Yampolsky]], who took him around Kyoto.<ref name=\"Stirling 83\"/>  In early July 1955, he took refuge and requested to become Miura's disciple, thus formally becoming a Buddhist.<ref>Suiter (2002) p. 208</ref>\n\nHe returned to California via the Persian Gulf, Turkey, Sri Lanka and various Pacific Islands, in 1958, voyaging as a crewman in the engine room on the oil freighter ''Sappa Creek'',<ref>Suiter (2002) p. 235</ref><ref name=\"Smith 12\">Smith (2000) p. 12</ref> and took up residence at Marin-an again.<ref>Suiter (2002) p. 238</ref> He turned one room into a zendo, with about six regular participants. In early June, he met the poet [[Joanne Kyger]]. She became his girlfriend, and eventually his wife.<ref>Suiter (2002) p. 241</ref>  In 1959, he shipped for Japan again, where he rented a cottage outside Kyoto.<ref>Suiter (2002) p. 245</ref>  He became the first foreign disciple of [[Oda Sesso]] Roshi, the new abbot of [[Daitoku-ji]].<ref>Suiter (2002) p. 246</ref>  He married Kyger on February 28, 1960, immediately after her arrival, which Sasaki insisted they do, if they were to live together and be associated with the First Zen Institute of America.<ref name=\"Stirling 110\">Stirling (2006) p. 110</ref> Snyder and Joanne Kyger were married from 1960 to 1965.<ref name=\"Suiter 325\">Suiter (2002) p. 325</ref>\n\nDuring the period between 1956 and 1969, Snyder went back and forth between California and Japan,<ref name=\"Suiter 250\">Suiter (2002) p. 250</ref> studying Zen, working on translations with Ruth Fuller Sasaki, and finally living for a while with a group of other people on the small, volcanic island of [[Suwanosejima]]. His previous study of written Chinese assisted his immersion in the Zen tradition (with its roots in [[Tang Dynasty]] China) and enabled him to take on certain professional projects while he was living in Japan. Snyder received the Zen precepts and a dharma name (''Chofu'', \"Listen to the Wind\"), and lived sometimes as a de facto monk, but never registered to become a priest<ref name=\"Suiter 250\"/> and planned eventually to return to the United States to 'turn the wheel of the dharma'. During this time, he published a collection of his poems from the early to mid '50s, ''Myths & Texts'' (1960), and ''Six Sections from Mountains and Rivers Without End'' (1965). This last was the beginning of a project that he was to continue working on until the late 1990s. Much of Snyder's poetry expresses experiences, environments, and insights involved with the work he has done for a living: logger, fire-lookout, steam-freighter crew, translator, carpenter, and itinerant poet, among other things. During his years in Japan, Snyder was also initiated into [[Shugendo]], a form of ancient Japanese [[animism]], (see also [[Yamabushi]]).<ref name=\"Kyger 103\">Kyger (2000) p. 103</ref> In the early 1960s he traveled for six months through India with his wife Joanne, Allen Ginsberg, and Peter Orlovsky.<ref name=\"Smith 12\"/> Snyder and Joanne Kyger separated soon after a trip to India, and divorced in 1965.\n\n===Dharma Bums===\nIn the 1950s, Snyder took part in the rise of a strand of Buddhist anarchism emerging from the [[Beat generation|Beat]] movement. Snyder was the inspiration for the character Japhy Ryder in Jack Kerouac's novel ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' (1958). Snyder had spent considerable time in Japan studying Zen Buddhism, and in 1961 published an essay, \"Buddhist Anarchism\", where he described the connection he saw between these two traditions, originating in different parts of the world: \"The [[mercy]] of the [[Western culture|West]] has been [[social revolution]]; the mercy of the [[East]] has been individual insight into the basic self/void.\" He advocated \"using such means as [[civil disobedience]], outspoken criticism, protest, [[pacifism]], voluntary poverty and even gentle violence\" and defended \"the right of individuals to smoke [[cannabis (drug)|ganja]], eat [[peyote]], be [[polygamy|polygymous]], [[polyandrous]] or homosexual\" which he saw as being banned by \"the Judaeo-Capitalist-Christian-Marxist West\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert Graham |coauthors= |authorlink= |title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume 2 |year=2009 |publisher=Black Rose Books Ltd. |location= |pages=240\u2013243 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tnnkLRvkuQC&pg=PA240&dq=%22Buddhist+anarchism%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YBHgU7ODDcbisATf04CQAw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22Buddhist%20anarchism%22&f=false |isbn=9781551643106 }}</ref>\n\n===Kitkitdizze===\nIn 1966, Snyder joined Allen Ginsberg, [[Zentatsu Richard Baker]], Roshi of the San Francisco Zen Center, and Donald Walters, a.k.a. \"Swami Kriyananda,\" to buy {{convert|100|acre|km2}} in the Sierra foothills, north of Nevada City, California. In 1970, this would become his home, with the Snyder family's portion being named Kitkitdizze.<ref name=\"Suiter 251\"/> Snyder spent the summers of 1967 and 1968 with a group of Japanese back-to-the-land drop-outs known as [[The Tribe (Buzoku)|\"the Tribe\"]] on [[Suwanosejima]]<ref name=\"Halper 94\">Halper (1991) p. 94</ref> (a small Japanese island in the [[East China Sea]]), where they combed the beaches, gathered edible plants, and fished. On the island, on August 6,<ref name=\"Suiter 251\">Suiter (2002) p. 251</ref> 1967, he married Masa Uehara, whom he had met in Osaka a year earlier.<ref name=\"Suiter 250\"/> In 1968, they moved to California with their infant son, Kai (born April 1968).<ref name=\"Suiter 251\"/> Their second son, Gen, was born a year later. In 1971, they moved to the San Juan Ridge in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada  of Northern California, near the South Yuba River, where they and friends built a house that drew on rural-Japanese and Native-American architectural ideas.  In 1967 his book ''The Back Country'' appeared, again mainly a collection of poems stretching back over about fifteen years. Snyder devoted a section at the end of the book to his translations of eighteen poems by [[Kenji Miyazawa]].\n\n===Later life and writings===\n''Regarding Wave'' appeared in January 1970, a stylistic departure offering poems that were more emotional, metaphoric, and lyrical. From the late 1960s, the content of Snyder's poetry increasingly had to do with family, friends, and community. He continued to publish poetry throughout the 1970s, much of it reflecting his re-immersion in life on the American continent and his involvement in the [[back-to-the-land movement]] in the Sierra foothills. His 1974 book ''[[Turtle Island (book)|Turtle Island]]'', titled after [[Turtle Island (North America)|a Native American name for the North American continent]], won a Pulitzer Prize. It also influenced numerous West Coast Generation X writers, including [[Alex Steffen]], [[Bruce Barcott]] and [[Mark Morford]]. His 1983 book ''Axe Handles'', won an American Book Award. Snyder wrote numerous essays setting forth his views on poetry, culture, social experimentation, and the environment. Many of these were collected in ''Earth House Hold'' (1969), ''The Old Ways'' (1977), ''The Real Work'' (1980), ''The Practice of the Wild'' (1990), ''A Place in Space'' (1995), and ''The Gary Snyder Reader'' (1999). In 1979, Snyder published ''He Who Hunted Birds in His Father's Village: The Dimensions of a Haida Myth'', based on his Reed thesis. Snyder's journals from his travel in India in the mid-1960s appeared in 1983 under the title ''Passage Through India''. In these, his wide-ranging interests in cultures, natural history, religions, social critique, contemporary America, and hands-on aspects of rural life, as well as his ideas on literature, were given full-blown articulation.\n\nIn 1986, Snyder became a professor in the writing program at the [[University of California, Davis]]. Snyder is now professor emeritus of English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ucdavis.edu/people/directory/fzsnyder|title=Gary Snyder-Department of English|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref>\n\nSnyder was married to Uehara for twenty-two years; the couple divorced in 1989. Snyder married Carole Lynn Koda (October 3, 1947 \u2013 June 29, 2006),<ref>Snyder (2007) p. 161</ref> who would write ''Homegrown: Thirteen brothers and sisters, a century in America'', in 1991,<ref name=\"Suiter 325\"/><ref>Western Literature Association (1997) p. 316</ref> and remained married to her until her death of cancer. She had been born in the third generation of a successful Japanese-American farming family, noted for its excellent rice. She shared Buddhism, extensive travels, and work with Snyder, and performed independent work as a naturalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theunion.com/article/20060707/OBITUARIES/60707001|title=Sponsored Obituary: Carole Koda|date=2006-07-07|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>\n\nAs Snyder's involvement in environmental issues and his teaching grew, he seemed to move away from poetry for much of the 1980s and early 1990s. However, in 1996 he published the complete ''[[Mountains and Rivers Without End]]'', a mixture of the lyrical and epic modes celebrating the act of inhabitation on a specific place on the planet. This work was written over a 40-year period. It has been translated into Japanese, French and Russian. In 2004 Snyder published ''Danger on Peaks'', his first collection of new poems in twenty years.\n\nSnyder was awarded the Levinson Prize from the journal ''Poetry'', the American Poetry Society Shelley Memorial Award (1986), was inducted into the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] (1987), and won the 1997 Bollingen Prize for Poetry and, that same year, the John Hay Award for Nature Writing.<ref>[http://wwwenglish.ucdavis.edu/faculty/snyder/a_brief_biography.htm A Brief Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513201100/http://wwwenglish.ucdavis.edu/faculty/snyder/a_brief_biography.htm |date=2008-05-13 }}</ref>  Snyder also has the distinction of being the first American to receive the Buddhism Transmission Award (for 1998) from the Japan-based Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai Foundation. For his ecological and social activism, Snyder was named as one of the 100 visionaries selected in 1995 by ''[[Utne Reader]]''.\n\nSnyder's life and work was celebrated in John J. Healy's 2010 documentary ''The Practice of the Wild.'' The film, which debuted at the 53rd [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], features wide-ranging, running conversations between Snyder and poet, writer and longtime colleague [[Jim Harrison]], filmed mostly on the [[Hearst Ranch]] in [[San Simeon]], California. The film also shows archival photographs and film of Snyder's life.<ref>[http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-practice-of-the-wild/5150 '\"The Practice of the Wild \". ''Slant Magazine''  8 November 2010]</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Poetics===\nGary Snyder uses mainly common speech-patterns as the basis for his lines, though his style has been noted for its \"flexibility\" and the variety of different forms his poems have taken. He typically use neither conventional meters nor intentional rhyme.  \"Love and respect for the primitive tribe, honour accorded the Earth, the escape from city and industry into both the past and the possible, contemplation, the communal\", such, according to Glyn Maxwell, is the awareness and commitment behind the specific poems.\n\nThe author and editor [[Stewart Brand]] once wrote: \"Gary Snyder's poetry addresses the life-planet identification with unusual simplicity of style and complexity of effect.\"<ref>''[[CoEvolution Quarterly]]'', issue #4, 1974</ref> According to Jody Norton, this simplicity and complexity derives from Snyder's use of natural imagery (geographical formations, flora, and fauna)in his poems. Such imagery can be both sensual at a personal level yet universal and generic in nature.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=Jody|author2=Gary Snyder|title=The Importance of Nothing: Absence and Its Origins in the Poetry of Gary Snyder|journal=Contemporary Literature|year=1987|volume=28|issue=1|pages=41\u201366|doi=10.2307/1208572}}<!--|accessdate=11 November 2012--></ref> In the 1968 poem \"Beneath My Hand and Eye the Distant Hills, Your Body,\" the author compares the intimate experience of a lover's caress with the mountains, hills, cinder cones, and craters of the Uintah Mountains. Readers become explorers on both a very private level as well as a very public and grand level. A simplistic touch becoming a very complex interaction occurring at multiple levels. This is the effect Snyder intended. In an interview with Faas, he states, \"There is a direction which is very beautiful, and that's the direction of the organism being less and less locked into itself, less and less locked into its own body structure and its relatively inadequate sense organs, towards a state where the organism can actually go out from itself and share itself with others.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Robert Frank|first=Henry Sayre|title=On 'Beneath My Hand and Eye the Distant Hills, Your Body'|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/snyder/beneath.htm|work=\"Introduction\" to The Line in Postmodern Poetry|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nSnyder has always maintained that his personal sensibility arose from his interest in Native Americans and their involvement with nature and knowledge of it; indeed, their ways seemed to resonate with his own. And he has sought something akin to this through Buddhist practices, Yamabushi initiation, and other experiences and involvements. However, since his youth he has been quite literate, and he has written about his appreciation of writers of similar sensibilities, like [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[William Butler Yeats]], and some of the great ancient Chinese poets.  [[William Carlos Williams]] was another influence, especially on Snyder's earliest published work. Starting in high school, Snyder read and loved the work of Robinson Jeffers, his predecessor in poetry of the landscape of the American West; but, whereas Jeffers valued nature over humankind, Snyder saw humankind as part of nature.<ref>Suiter (2002) pp. 38\u201341</ref> Snyder commented in interview  \"I have some concerns that I'm continually investigating that tie together [[biology]], [[mysticism]], [[prehistory]], general [[systems theory]]\".<ref>''New York Quarterly'' \"Craft Interview\", 1973</ref> Snyder argues that poets, and humans in general, need to adjust to very long timescales, especially when judging the consequences of their actions. His poetry examines the gap between nature and culture so as to point to ways in which the two can be more closely integrated.\n\nIn 2004, receiving the [[Masaoka Shiki International Haiku Awards]] Grand Prize, Snyder highlighted traditional ballads and folk songs, Native American songs and poems, [[William Blake]], [[Walt Whitman]], Jeffers, [[Ezra Pound]], [[Noh]] drama, Zen aphorisms, [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], and Robert Duncan as significant influences on his poetry, but added, \"the influence from haiku and from the Chinese is, I think, the deepest.\"<ref>Snyder (2007) p 59</ref>\n\n=== Romanticism ===\nSnyder is among those writers who have sought to dis-entrench conventional thinking about primitive peoples that has viewed them as simple-minded, ignorantly superstitious, brutish, and prone to violent emotionalism. In the 1960s Snyder developed a \"[[Neo-Tribalism|neo-tribalist]]\" view<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Snyder (1969) \"Why Tribe?,\" in ''Earth House Hold''.  New York: New Directions.</ref> akin to the \"post-modernist\" theory of French Sociologist [[Michel Maffesoli]]. The \"re-tribalization\" of the modern, mass-society world envisioned by [[Marshall McLuhan]], with all of the ominous, dystopian possibilities that McLuhan warned of, subsequently accepted by many modern intellectuals, is not the future that Snyder expects or works toward. Snyder's is a positive interpretation of the tribe and of the possible future.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Charters, Samuel  (1971) \"Gary Snyder,\" pp 57\u201364, in ''Some Poems/Poets: studies in Underground American Poetry Since 1945''.  Berkeley: Oyez.</ref>\nTodd Ensign describes Snyder's interpretation as blending ancient tribal beliefs and traditions, philosophy, physicality, and nature with politics to create his own form of Postmodern environmentalism. Snyder rejects the perspective which portrays nature and humanity in direct opposition to one another. Instead, he chooses to write from multiple viewpoints. He purposely sets out to bring about change on the emotional, physical, and political levels by emphasizing the ecological problems faced by today's society.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ensign|first=Todd|title=Gary Snyder: A Postmodern Perspective|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/snyder/ensign.htm|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Beat===\nGary Snyder is widely regarded as a member of the Beat Generation circle of writers: he was one of the poets that read at the famous [[Six Gallery reading|''Six Gallery'']] event, and was written about in one of Kerouac's most popular novels, ''The Dharma Bums''. Some critics argue that Snyder's connection with the Beats is exaggerated and that he might better be regarded as a part of the [[San Francisco Renaissance]], which developed independently. Snyder himself has some reservations about the label \"Beat\", but does not appear to have any strong objection to being included in the group. He often talks about the Beats in the first person plural, referring to the group as \"we\" and \"us\".\n\nA quotation from a 1974 interview at the University of North Dakota Writers Conference (published in ''The Beat Vision''):\n<blockquote>\nI never did know exactly what was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the original meeting, association, comradeship of Allen [Ginsberg], myself, [[Michael McClure|Michael [McClure]]], Lawrence [Ferlinghetti], Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory [Corso], for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory as well as the others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.<ref>Knight 1987.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSnyder has also commented \"The term Beat is better used for a smaller group of writers ... the immediate group around Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, plus [[Gregory Corso]] and a few others. Many of us ... belong together in the category of the San Francisco Renaissance. ... Still, beat can also be defined as a particular state of mind ... and I was in that mind for a while\".<ref>''The Columbia History of American Poetry'' (1993) by Jay Parini and Brett Candlish Millier {{ISBN|0-231-07836-6}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Library resources box|by=yes|lcheading= Snyder, Gary}}\n*''Riprap and Cold Mountain Poems'' (1959)\n*''Myths & Texts'' (1960)\n*''Six Sections from Mountains and Rivers Without End'' (1965)\n*''The Back Country'' (1967)\n*''Regarding Wave'' (1969)\n*''Earth House Hold'' (1969)\n*''[[Turtle Island (poetry book)|Turtle Island]]'' (1974)\n*''The Old Ways'' (1977)\n*''He Who Hunted Birds in His Father's Village: The Dimensions of a Haida Myth'' (1979)\n*''The Real Work: Interviews & Talks 1964-1979'' (1980)\n*''Axe Handles'' (1983)\n*''Passage Through India'' (1983)\n*''Left Out in the Rain'' (1988)\n*''The Practice of the Wild'' (1990)\n*''No Nature: New and Selected Poems'' (1992)\n*''A Place in Space'' (1995)\n*narrator of the audio book version of [[Kazuaki Tanahashi]]'s ''Moon in a Dewdrop'' from [[D\u014dgen]]'s ''[[Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d]]''\n*''Mountains and Rivers Without End'' (1996)\n*''The Geography Of Home'' (Poetry book)(1999)\n*''The Gary Snyder Reader: Prose, Poetry, and Translations'' (1999)\n*''The High Sierra of California'', with [[Tom Killion (artist)|Tom Killion]] (2002)\n*''Look Out: a Selection of Writings'' (November 2002)\n*''Danger on Peaks'' (2005)\n*''Back on the Fire: Essays'' (2007)\n*''The Selected Letters of Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder, 1956-1991,'' (2009).\n*''Tamalpais Walking'', with [[Tom Killion (artist)|Tom Killion]] (2009)\n*''The Etiquette of Freedom'', with Jim Harrison (2010) film by Will Hearst with book edited by Paul Ebenkamp\n*''Nobody Home: Writing, Buddhism, and Living in Places'', with Julia Martin, [[Trinity University Press]] (2014).\n*''This Present Moment'' (April 2015)\n*''Distant Neighbors: The Selected Letters of [[Wendell Berry]] and Gary Snyder'' (May 2015)\n*''The Great Clod: Notes and Memories on the Natural History of China and Japan'' (March 2016)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Charters, Ann (ed.).

It has become a symbol of Thompson and gonzo journalism as a whole.]]\n{{Journalism sidebar}}\n\n'''Gonzo journalism''' is a style of [[journalism]] that is written without claims of objectivity, often including the reporter as part of the story via a [[first-person narrative]]. The word \"gonzo\" is believed to have been first used in 1970 to describe [[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved|an article]] by [[Hunter S. Thompson]], who later popularized the style. It is an energetic first-person participatory writing style in which the author is a protagonist, and it draws its power from a combination of social critique and self-satire.{{Sfn|Bowe|2012|p=92}} It has since been applied to other subjective artistic endeavors.\n\nGonzo journalism involves an approach to accuracy that concerns the reporting of personal experiences and emotions, in contrast to traditional journalism, which favors a detached style and relies on facts or quotations that can be verified by third parties. Gonzo journalism disregards the strictly-edited product favored by newspaper media and strives for a more personal approach; the personality of a piece is as important as the event or actual subject of the piece. Use of [[sarcasm]], [[humor]], exaggeration, and [[profanity]] is common.\n\nThompson, who was among the forefathers of the [[new journalism]] movement, said in the February 15, 1973, issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', \"If I'd written the truth I knew for the past ten years, about 600 people\u2014including me\u2014would be rotting in prison cells from Rio to Seattle today. Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism.\"<ref name=\"Andrews1993\">{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Robert|title=The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cl5c4T9LWkC&pg=PA486|accessdate=14 January 2014|date=January 1993|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-07194-9|page=486}}</ref>\n\n==Origin of the term==\nThe term \"gonzo\" was first used in connection with Hunter S. Thompson by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' magazine editor [[Bill Cardoso]] in 1970. He described Thompson's article \"[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]],\" which was written for the June 1970 edition of ''[[Scanlan's Monthly]]'', as \"pure Gonzo journalism.\"{{Sfn|Hirst|2004|p=5}} Cardoso claimed that \"gonzo\" was [[South Boston]] [[Irish language|Irish]] [[slang]] describing the last man standing after an all-night drinking marathon.{{Sfn|Thompson|1997}} He also claimed that it was a corruption of the [[French Canadian]] word \"gonzeaux,\" which means \"shining path,\" although this is disputed.{{Sfn|Hirst|2004}}\n\nAnother speculation is that the word may have been inspired by the 1960 hit song '\"[[:File:Gonzo by James Booker, 1960, gonzo.ogg|Gonzo]]\" by [[New Orleans]] [[rhythm and blues]] pianist [[James Booker]]. This possibility is supported by a 2007 oral biography of Thompson, which states that the term is taken from a song by Booker{{Sfn|Wenner|Seymour|2007}} but does not explain why Thompson or Cardoso would have chosen the term to describe Thompson's journalism. The 2013 documentary ''[[James Booker#Bayou Maharajah: The Tragic Genius of James Booker|Bayou Maharaja: The Tragic Genius of James Booker]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Keber|first=Lily|title=Bayou Maharajah: The Tragic Genius of James Booker|url=http://www.bayoumaharajah.com|publisher=Mairzy Doats Productions|accessdate=3 April 2014|year=2013}}</ref> quotes Thompson's literary executor as saying that the song was the origin of the term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dosavannah.com/article/mon-12162013-2113/unplugged-new-documentary-explores-life-legacy-pianist-james-booker|title=Unplugged: New documentary explores life, legacy of pianist James Booker|work=Do Savannah, arts and entertainment news for the Creative Coast}}</ref> According to a Greg Johnson biographical note on Booker,<ref>[http://www.cascadeblues.org/History/JamesBooker.htm James Booker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420171707/http://www.cascadeblues.org/History/JamesBooker.htm |date=2008-04-20 }}, by Greg Johnson, reprint from the February, 2002 ''BluesNotes'' at Cascade Blues Association</ref> the song title \"Gonzo\" comes from a character in a movie called ''The Pusher'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054219/|title=The Pusher (1960)|author=goblinhairedguy|date=1 February 1960|work=IMDb}}</ref> which in turn may have been inspired by a 1956 [[Evan Hunter]] novel of the same title.\n\nThompson himself first used the term referring to his own work on page 12 of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] classic<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/4284147.stm|title=BBC NEWS \u2013 Entertainment \u2013 Thompson's classic Las Vegas trip|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]''. He wrote, \"But what ''was'' the story? Nobody had bothered to say. So we would have to drum it up on our own. Free Enterprise. The American Dream. [[Horatio Alger]] gone mad on drugs in Las Vegas. Do it ''now'': pure Gonzo journalism.\"{{Sfn|Thompson|1971}}\n\n==Hunter S. Thompson==\nThompson based his style on [[William Faulkner]]'s notion that \"fiction is often the best fact\".{{sfn|Rolling Stone|1998}} While the things that Thompson wrote about are basically true, he used satirical devices to drive his points home. He often wrote about [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] and [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] use, which added subjective flair to his reporting. The term \"gonzo\" has also come into (sometimes [[pejorative]]) use to describe journalism in Thompson's style, characterized by a drug-fueled [[stream of consciousness writing]] technique.\n\n''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' followed the [[Mint 400]] piece in 1971 and included a main character by the name of [[Raoul Duke]], accompanied by his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, with defining art by [[Ralph Steadman]]. Although this book is considered a prime example of gonzo journalism, Thompson regarded it as a failed experiment.<ref>Thompson, Hunter S. ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Other American Stories''. New York: Random House, 1996. p. 210. {{ISBN|0-679-60298-4}}</ref> He had intended it to be an unedited record of everything he did as it happened, but he edited the book five times before publication.\n\nThompson would instigate events himself, often in a [[prank]]ish or belligerent manner, and then document both his actions and those of others. Notoriously neglectful of deadlines, Thompson often annoyed his editors because he submitted articles late, \"too late to be edited, yet still in time for the printer\".<ref>Whitmer, Peter O. 1993. When the going gets weird: The twisted life and times of Hunter S. Thompson. New York: Hyperion.</ref> Thompson wanted his work to be read as he wrote it, in its \"true Gonzo\" form. Historian [[Douglas Brinkley]] said gonzo journalism requires virtually no rewriting and frequently uses transcribed interviews and verbatim telephone conversations.{{Sfn|Thompson|2000}}\n\n\"I don't get any satisfaction out of the old traditional journalist's view: 'I just covered the story. I just gave it a balanced view,'\" Thompson said in an interview for the online edition of ''[[The Atlantic]]''. \"Objective journalism is one of the main reasons American [[politics]] has been allowed to be so corrupt for so long. You can't be objective about [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/graffiti/hunter.htm |title=Writing on the Wall: An Interview with Hunter S. Thompson |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Company |date=27 August 1997 |accessdate=24 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nThompson felt that [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity in journalism]] was a myth. Gonzo journalism has now become a ''bona fide'' style of writing that concerns itself with \"telling it like it is\", similar to the [[New Journalism]] of the 1960s, led primarily by [[Tom Wolfe]] and also championed by [[Lester Bangs]], [[George Plimpton]], [[Terry Southern]], and [[John Birmingham]], and is considered a subgenre{{cn|reason=this claim is not self-evident.|date=August 2018}} of [[New Journalism]]. When asked whether there was a difference between the two, Thompson answered, \"Yeah, I think so. Unlike Tom Wolfe or [[Gay Talese]], for instance, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then I don't really think of myself as a reporter.\"<ref>Thompson, Hunter S. ''Ancient Gonzo Wisdom: Interviews with Hunter S. Thompson''.

The pandas would move from the valleys into the Qinling Mountains and would only return to the valleys in autumn.

This practice has been termed \"panda diplomacy\".\n\nBy 1984, however, pandas were no longer given as gifts. Instead, the PRC began to offer pandas to other nations only on 10-year loans, under terms including a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and a provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of the PRC. Since 1998, because of a [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] [[lawsuit]], the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] only allows a US [[zoo]] to import a panda if the zoo can ensure the PRC will channel more than half of its loan fee into [[conservation movement|conservation]] efforts for the giant panda and its habitat.\n\nIn May 2005, the PRC offered a breeding pair to [[Taiwan]]. The issue became embroiled in [[cross-Strait relations]] \u2013 both over the underlying symbolism, and over technical issues such as whether the transfer would be considered \"domestic\" or \"international\", or whether any true conservation purpose would be served by the exchange.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/45901/ China's Panda Politics].

Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas in China because of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]], but pandas remained a source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas' habitat, and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], all studies and conservation activities on the pandas were stopped. After the [[Chinese economic reform]], demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the [[underground economy|black market]], acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time.\n\n[[File:Panda Cub from Wolong, Sichuan, China.JPG|thumb|right|Closeup of a seven-month-old panda cub]]\n\nThough the [[Wolong National Nature Reserve]] was set up by the PRC government in 1958 to save the declining panda population, few advances in the conservation of pandas were made, owing to inexperience and insufficient knowledge of ecology. Many believed the best way to save the pandas was to cage them. As a result, pandas were caged at any sign of decline, and suffered from terrible conditions. Because of pollution and destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a [[rare species]].\n\nIn 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes [[DNA]] from panda [[Feces|droppings]], scientists believe the wild population may be as large as 3,000.<ref name=\"Britannica Earth\"/> In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves in 1998.<ref name=\"BBC_06-07\" /> As the species has been reclassified to \"vulnerable\" since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working. Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the [[State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China|State Forestry Administration of China]] announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level for panda, and would instead reinforce the conservation efforts.<ref>[http://www.forestry.gov.cn/main/195/content-902929.html The Panda is still endangered species, and the conservation efforts still need to be reinforced] ''State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China'' (in Chinese)</ref>\n\nThe giant panda is among the world's most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] designation. The [[Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries]], located in the southwest province of [[Sichuan]] and covering seven natural reserves, were inscribed onto the World Heritage List in 2006.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5174854.stm Pandas gain world heritage status] ''BBC News''</ref><ref>[http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20060718-072442-2033r Panda sanctuaries now World Heritage sites] ''United Press International''</ref>\n\nNot all conservationists agree that the money spent on conserving pandas is well spent.

The clarinet gesture that opens ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' could likewise be thought of either way: it was originally planned as a glissando (Gershwin's score labels each individual note) but is in practice played as a portamento though described as a glissando.<ref>{{cite book |author=Greenberg, Rodney| year=1998| title=George Gershwin| publisher=Phaidon Press| isbn=0-7148-3504-8| pages=70}}</ref>\n\n==Discrete glissando==\nOn some instruments (e.g., [[piano]], [[harp]], [[xylophone]]), discrete tones are clearly audible when sliding. For example, on a [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], a player's fingertips can be made to slide across the white keys or over the black keys, producing either a [[C major]] scale or an [[F-sharp major|F{{music|#}} major]] pentatonic (or their [[minor scale|relative]] [[Mode (music)|modes]]); or, by performing both at once, it is possible to produce a full chromatic scale, but this is difficult. Organ players\u2014particularly in contemporary music\u2014sometimes employ an effect known as the palm glissando, where over the course of the glissando the flat of the hand is used to depress a wide area of keys simultaneously, resulting in a dramatic atonal sweep. On a harp, the player can slide their finger across the strings, quickly playing the scale (or on pedal harp even [[arpeggio]]s such as C{{music|flat}}-D-E{{music|sharp}}-F-G{{music|sharp}}-A{{music|flat}}-B). Wind, brass, and fretted-stringed-instrument players can perform an extremely rapid chromatic scale (e.g., sliding up or down a string quickly on a fretted instrument).\n\nMaurice Ravel's piece [[Miroirs|Alborada del Gracioso]] contains notable piano glissando passages in thirds executed by the right hand.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiLrWDoHWeU \"Richter - Maurice Ravel's Alborada del gracioso\"], ''YouTube.com''.</ref>\n\nArpeggio effects (likewise named glissando) are also obtained by bowed strings (playing [[Harmonic#Harmonics on stringed instruments|harmonics]]) and brass, especially the [[French horn|horn]].<ref>Del Mar, Norman: ''Anatomy of the Orchestra'' (University of California Press 1981).

Bent notes are commonly played on fretted instruments, literally by bending the string with excess finger pressure, or on [[Free reed aerophone|free reed]] instruments such as the [[harmonica]], by using excess air pressure to overblow the reed. On brass instruments such as the trumpet, the note is bent by using the lip. \"[[indefinite pitch|Indeterminately pitched instruments]] [such as [[unpitched percussion instrument]]s and friction [[drum roll]]s]...produce a pitch or pitch spectrum that becomes higher with an increase of [[dynamics (music)|dynamic]] and lower with a decrease of dynamic.\"<ref>Solomon, Samuel Z.

The genus currently consists of one species, ''Giraffa camelopardalis'', the [[type species]]. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils. Taxonomic classifications of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] and [[nuclear DNA]], as well as morphological measurements of ''Giraffa,'' but the IUCN currently recognises only one species with nine subspecies.\n\nThe giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like [[ossicone]]s, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Giraffidae]], along with its closest extant relative, the [[okapi]]. Its scattered range extends from [[Chad]] in the north to [[South Africa]] in the south, and from [[Niger]] in the west to [[Somalia]] in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit [[savannah]]s and [[woodland]]s. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily [[Acacieae|acacia]] species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. They may be preyed on by [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s and [[African wild dog]]s. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through \"necking\", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. [[dominance (ethology)|Dominant]] males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.\n\nThe giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] to extinction, and has been [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous [[national park]]s and [[game reserve]]s but estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of ''Giraffa'' in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"giraffe\" has its earliest known origins in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word {{transl|ar|zar\u0101fah}} ({{lang|ar|\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0641\u0629}}),<ref name=OED/> perhaps borrowed from the animal's [[Somali language|Somali]] name {{lang|so|geri}}.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peust, C.|contribution=Some Cushitic Etymologies|editor=Dolgopol\u02b9ski\u012d, A.|editor2=Tak\u00e1cs, G.|editor3=Jungraithmayr, H.|year=2009|title=Semito-Hamitic Festschrift for A.B.

Griffith used two [[Strain (biology)|strain]]s of pneumococcus (''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'') bacteria which infect [[mouse|mice]] \u2013 a type III-S (smooth) which was [[virulent]], and a type II-R (rough) strain which was nonvirulent. The III-S strain synthesized a [[polysaccharide]] capsule that protected itself from the host's [[immune system]], resulting in the death of the host, while the II-R strain did not have that protective capsule and was defeated by the host's immune system. A German bacteriologist, [[Fred Neufeld]], had discovered the three pneumococcal types (Types I, II, and III) and discovered the [[Quellung reaction]] to identify them in vitro.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iwDn7ubDO2kC Lehrer, Steven. Explorers of the Body. 2nd edition 2006 p 44]</ref> Until Griffith's experiment, bacteriologists believed that the types were fixed and unchangeable, from one generation to another.\n\nIn this experiment, [[bacterium|bacteria]] from the III-S strain were killed by heat, and their remains were added to II-R strain bacteria. While neither alone harmed the mice, the combination was able to kill its host. Griffith was also able to isolate both live II-R and live III-S strains of pneumococcus from the blood of these dead mice. Griffith concluded that the type II-R had been \"transformed\" into the lethal III-S strain by a \"transforming principle\" that was somehow part of the dead III-S strain bacteria.\n\nToday, we know that the \"transforming principle\" Griffith observed was the [[DNA]] of the III-s strain bacteria. While the bacteria had been killed, the DNA had survived the heating process and was taken up by the II-R strain bacteria. The III-S strain DNA contains the genes that form the smooth protective polysaccharide capsule. Equipped with this gene, the former II-R strain bacteria were now protected from the host's immune system and could kill the host. The exact nature of the transforming principle (DNA) was verified in the experiments done by [[Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment|Avery, McLeod and McCarty]] and by [[Hershey\u2013Chase experiment|Hershey and Chase]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal | author = Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty | title = Studies on the Chemical Nature of the Substance Inducing Transformation of Pneumococcal Types: Induction of Transformation by a Desoxyribonucleic Acid Fraction Isolated from Pneumococcus Type III | journal = Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 137\u2013158 | year = 1944 | doi = 10.1084/jem.79.2.137 | pmid=19871359 | pmc=2135445}}\n::(References the original experiment by Griffith.

On his death bed in 1850, Bastiat described Molinari as the continuator of his works. In 1849, soon after [[The Revolutions of 1848 in France]], Molinari published two works: an essay, \"The Production of Security\", and a book, ''Les Soir\u00e9es de la Rue Saint-Lazare'', describing how a [[Market economy|market]] in justice and protection could advantageously replace the [[Sovereign state|state]].\n\nDuring the 1850s, Molinari fled to Belgium to escape threats from France's Emperor [[Napoleon III]].  He returned to Paris during the 1860s to work for the influential newspaper, ''[[Le Journal des D\u00e9bats]]'', which he edited from 1871 to 1876. Molinari later edited the ''[[Journal des \u00c9conomistes]]'', the publication of the [[French Political Economy Society]], from 1881 until 1909. In his 1899 book, ''The Society of Tomorrow'', he proposed a federated system of collective security, and reiterated his support for private competing defense agencies.\n\nMolinari's critique of the state sometimes resulted in him opposing causes and events which might seemingly be aligned with his overall critique of power and privilege. An example of this was the [[American Civil War]], which Molinari believed to be far more about the trade interests of northern industrialists than about slavery (though he did not deny that abolitionism was a part of the picture). \"In his last work, published a year before his death in 1912, Molinari never relented:<ref name=Mises>[[Ralph Raico|Raico, Ralph]] (2011-03-29) [https://mises.org/daily/5088/Neither-the-Wars-Nor-the-Leaders-Were-Great Neither the Wars Nor the Leaders Were Great], [[Mises Institute]]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe American Civil War had not been simply a humanitarian crusade to free the slaves. The war \"ruined the conquered provinces\", but the Northern plutocrats pulling the strings achieved their aim: the imposition of a vicious protectionism that led ultimately \"to the regime of trusts and produced the billionaires.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nMolinari's grave is located at [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, France.\n\n==Influence==\nSome [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] consider Molinari to be the first proponent of [[anarcho-capitalism]].<ref name=Mises/> In the preface to the 1977 English translation [[Murray Rothbard]] called \"The Production of Security\" the \"first presentation anywhere in human history of what is now called anarcho-capitalism\" though admitting that \"Molinari did not use the terminology, and probably would have balked at the name.\" [[Austrian School]] economist [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] says that \"the 1849 article 'The Production of Security' is probably the single most important contribution to the modern theory of anarcho-capitalism.\"<ref>Hoppe, Hans-Hermann.

Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307</ref> Guerrilla groups are a type of [[violent non-state actor]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Spanish word \"guerrilla\" is the diminutive form of \"guerra\" (\"war\"). The term became popular during the early-19th century [[Peninsular War]], when the Spanish and Portuguese people rose against the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic]] [[Grande Arm\u00e9e|troops]] and fought against a highly superior army using the guerrilla strategy. In correct [[Spanish language|Spanish]] usage, a person who is a member of a \"guerrilla\" unit is a \"guerrillero\" ({{IPA-es|\u0261eri\u02c8\u028ee\u027eo|}}) if male, or a \"guerrillera\" ([[Help:IPA/Spanish|[\u0261eri\u02c8\u028ee\u027ea]]]) if female.\n\nThe term \"guerrilla\" was used in English as early as 1809 to refer to the ''fighters'' (e.g., \"The town was taken by the guerrillas\"), and also (as in Spanish) to denote ''a group or band'' of such fighters. However, in most languages ''guerrilla'' still denotes the specific style of warfare. The use of the [[diminutive]] evokes the differences in number, scale, and scope between the guerrilla army and the formal, professional army of the state.{{original research inline|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Strategy, tactics and methods==\n{{Revolution sidebar}}\n[[File:Afrikaner Commandos2.JPG|thumb|left|Boer guerrillas during the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa]]\n[[File:Kovpak partisanki.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet partisans operating under [[Sydir Kovpak]] in [[Ukraine in World War II|German-occupied Ukraine]]]]\n{{See also|Strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare}}\n=== Strategy ===\nGuerrilla warfare is a type of [[asymmetric warfare]]: competition between opponents of unequal strength.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomes|first=Robert|date=Spring 2004|title=Relearning Counterinsurgency Warfare|url=http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/Parameters/Articles/04spring/tomes.pdf|journal=Parameters|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607224951/http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/Parameters/Articles/04spring/tomes.pdf|archivedate=7 June 2010}}</ref> It is also a type of irregular warfare: that is, it aims not simply to defeat an enemy, but to win popular support and political influence, to the enemy's cost.<ref>The Irregular Warrior, 4 October 2015 [http://irregularwarrior.com/2015/10 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</ref> Accordingly, guerrilla [[strategy]] aims to magnify the impact of a small, mobile force on a larger, more-cumbersome one.<ref>{{cite book | last1 =Van Creveld | first1 = Martin | title = The Oxford History of Modern War | chapter = Technology and War II:Postmodern War? | editors = Charles Townshend | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2000 | location = New York, USA | pages = 356\u2013358 | isbn = 978-0-19-285373-8}}</ref> If successful, guerrillas weaken their enemy by [[Attrition warfare|attrition]], eventually forcing them to withdraw.\n{{See also|Asymmetric warfare}}\n\n=== Tactics ===\nTactically, guerrillas usually avoid confrontation with large units and formations of enemy troops, but seek and attack small groups of enemy personnel and resources to gradually deplete the opposing force while minimizing their own losses.

For example, [[Mao Zedong]] summarized basic guerrilla tactics at the beginning of the Chinese \"[[Chiang Kai-shek#Chinese Civil War: 1927\u20131937|Second Revolutionary Civil War]]\" as:<blockquote>\"The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.\"<ref>Mao Tse-tung, \"A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire\", ''Selected Works'', Eng. ed., FLP, Peking, 1965, Vol. I.</ref>{{rp|p. 124}} </blockquote>At least one author credits the ancient Chinese work ''[[The Art of War]]'' with inspiring Mao's tactics.<ref name=\"M\" />{{rp|pp. 6\u20137}} In the 20th century, other communist leaders, including North Vietnamese [[Ho Chi Minh]], often used and developed guerrilla warfare tactics, which provided a model for their use elsewhere, leading to the Cuban \"[[foco]]\" theory and the anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Mujahadeen]] in [[Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"M\">McNeilly, Mark.

While the primary concern of guerrillas is the enemy's active military units, terrorists largely are concerned with non-military agents and target mostly civilians. Guerrilla forces principally fight in accordance with the law of war (''jus in bello''). In this sense, they respect the rights of innocent civilians by refraining from targeting them. According to the Ankara Center for Crisis and Policy Studies, terrorists do not limit their actions and terrorise civilians by putting fear in people's hearts and even kill innocent foreigners in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ankasam.org/en/differences-guerrilla-warfare-terrorism/#_edn3 | title=The Differences Between the Guerrilla Warfare and Terrorism| date=2017-09-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Growth during the 20th century ===\n\nIrregular warfare, based on elements later characteristic of modern guerrilla warfare, has existed throughout the battles of many [[ancient world|ancient civilizations]]. The growth of guerrilla warfare in the 20th century was inspired in part by theoretical works on guerrilla warfare, starting with the ''Manual de Guerra de Guerrillas'' by [[Mat\u00edas Ram\u00f3n Mella]] written in the 19th century and, more recently, Mao Zedong's ''[[On Guerrilla Warfare]]'', [[Che Guevara]]'s [http://www3.uakron.edu/worldciv/pascher/che.html ''Guerrilla Warfare''], and Lenin's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/gw/index.htm text of the same name], all written after the successful revolutions carried by them in China, Cuba and Russia, respectively. Those texts characterized the tactic of guerrilla warfare as, according to [[Che Guevara]]'s text, being<blockquote>\"used by the side which is supported by a majority but which possesses a much smaller number of arms for use in defense against oppression\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vRg2GDIohVcC&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=used+by+the+side+which+is+supported+by+a+majority+but+which+possesses+a+much+smaller+number+of+arms+for+use+in+defense+against+oppression#v=onepage&q=used%20by%20the%20side%20which%20is%20supported%20by%20a%20majority%20but%20which%20possesses%20a%20much%20smaller%20number%20of%20arms%20for%20use%20in%20defense%20against%20oppression&f=false|title=Guerrilla Warfare|isbn=9780842026789|last1=Guevara|first1=Ernesto|last2=Loveman|first2=Brian|last3=Thomas m.

One who rises in revolt against constituted authority; a rebel who is not recognised as a belligerent.\")</ref> In the main, the insurgents seek to destroy or erase the political authority of the defending authorities in a population they seek to control, and the counter-insurgent forces seek to protect that authority and reduce or eliminate the supplanting authority of the insurgents.\nCounter-insurgency operations are common during war, [[Military occupation|occupation]] and armed [[rebellion]]s. Counter-insurgency may be armed [[suppression of dissent|suppression]] of a rebellion, coupled with tactics such as \"[[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]]\" designed to fracture the links between the insurgency and the population in which the insurgents move. Because it may be difficult or impossible to distinguish between an insurgent, a supporter of an insurgency who is a [[non-combatant]], and entirely uninvolved members of the population, counter-insurgency operations have often rested on a confused, relativistic, or otherwise [[situational]] distinction between insurgents and non-combatants.\n\n===Scholarship===\nTheorists of counter-insurgency warfare have written extensively on the subject since the 1950s and 1960s but as early as the 1720s the third Marques of Santa Cruz de Marcenado (1684\u20131732) wrote that insurgencies were often the result of [[state failure]] and that the goal of those fighting the insurgents should be to seek the people's \"heart and love\".<ref name=\"test\">Excerpts from Santa Cruz's writings, translated into English, in Beatrice Heuser: ''The Strategy Makers: Thoughts on War and Society from Machiavelli to Clausewitz'' (Santa Monica, California: Greenwood/Praeger, 2010), {{ISBN|978-0-275-99826-4}}, pp. 124-146.</ref> The two most influential of scholars of counter-insurgency have been Westerners whose job it had been to fight insurgents (often colonised people). [[Robert Grainger Ker Thompson|Robert Thompson]] fought during the [[Malayan Emergency]] and [[David Galula]] fought during the [[Algerian War]]. Together these officers advocated multi-pronged strategies to win over the civilian population to the side of the counter-insurgent.\n\n====Classic guidelines====\nThe widely distributed and influential work of Sir [[Robert Grainger Ker Thompson|Robert Thompson]], [[counter-insurgency]] expert of the [[Malayan Emergency]], offers several such guidelines. Thompson's underlying assumption was that the counter-insurgent was committed to improving the rule of law and bettering local governance.<ref>Thompson, Robert (1966). ''Defeating Communist Insurgency: The Lessons of Malaya and Vietnam'', Chatto & Windus, {{ISBN|0-7011-1133-X}}</ref> Some governments, however, give such considerations short shrift.

Historian [[Timothy Snyder]] has written, \"In the guise of anti-[[Partisan (military)|partisan]] actions, the Germans killed perhaps three quarters of a million people, about 350,000 in [[Belarus]] alone, and lower but comparable numbers in [[Poland]] and [[Yugoslavia]].

[http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/afghan/report.pdf Report from Afghanistan]</ref>\n\n====Variants====\nSome writers on counter-insurgency warfare emphasise the more turbulent nature of today's guerrilla warfare environment, where the clear political goals, parties and structures of such places as [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]], and [[El Salvador]] are not as prevalent. These writers point to numerous guerrilla conflicts that centre around religious, ethnic or even criminal enterprise themes, and that do not lend themselves to the classic \"national liberation\" template.\n\nThe wide availability of the Internet has also caused changes in the tempo and mode of guerrilla operations in such areas as coordination of strikes, leveraging of financing, recruitment, and [[media manipulation]]. While the classic guidelines still apply, today's anti-guerrilla forces need to accept a more disruptive, disorderly and ambiguous mode of operation. According to [[David Kilcullen]]:\n\n{{quote|Insurgents may not be seeking to overthrow the state, may have no coherent strategy or may pursue a faith-based approach difficult to counter with traditional methods. There may be numerous competing insurgencies in one theater, meaning that the counterinsurgent must control the overall environment rather than defeat a specific enemy. The actions of individuals and the propaganda effect of a subjective \"single narrative\" may far outweigh practical progress, rendering counterinsurgency even more non-linear and unpredictable than before. The counterinsurgent, not the insurgent, may initiate the conflict and represent the forces of revolutionary change. The economic relationship between insurgent and population may be diametrically opposed to classical theory. And insurgent tactics, based on exploiting the propaganda effects of urban bombing, may invalidate some classical tactics and render others, like patrolling, counterproductive under some circumstances. Thus, field evidence suggests, classical theory is necessary but not sufficient for success against contemporary insurgencies.<ref>Kilcullen, David.

This theory was later formalised as \"focal-ism\" by [[R\u00e9gis Debray]]. Its central principle is that [[vanguardism]] by [[cadres]] of small, fast-moving [[paramilitary]] groups can provide a focus for popular discontent against a sitting regime, and thereby lead a general [[insurrection]]. Although the original approach was to mobilise and launch attacks from rural areas, many ''foco'' ideas were adapted into [[urban guerrilla warfare]] movements.\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Asymmetric warfare]]\n* [[Cyberwarfare]]\n* [[Fabian strategy]]\n* [[Freedom Fighters (disambiguation)|Freedom Fighters]]\n* [[History of guerrilla warfare]]\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n* [[List of guerrilla movements]]\n* [[List of guerrillas]]\n* [[List of revolutions and rebellions]]\n* [[Militia]]\n* [[Paramilitary]]\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n* [[Resistance during World War II]]\n* [[Violent non-state actor]]\n* [[Special forces]]\n* [[Unconventional warfare]]\n* [[\"Yank\" Levy]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|45em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Asprey, Robert.

The version given below attempts to represent all the steps in the proof and all the important ideas faithfully, while restating the proof in the modern language of [[mathematical logic]]. This outline should not be considered a rigorous proof of the theorem.\n\n[[File:1925 kurt g\u00f6del (cropped).png|thumb|right|200px|Kurt G\u00f6del (1925)]]\n\n== Assumptions ==\n\nWe work with [[first-order predicate calculus]]. Our languages allow constant, function and relation symbols. Structures consist of (non-empty) domains and interpretations of the relevant symbols as constant members, functions or relations over that domain.\n\nWe assume classical logic (as opposed to intuitionistic logic for example).\n\nWe fix some axiomatization (i.e. a syntax-based, machine-manageable proof system) of the predicate calculus: logical axioms and rules of inference. Any of the several well-known equivalent axiomatizations will do. G\u00f6del's original proof assumed the Hilbert-Ackermann proof system.\n\nWe assume without proof all the basic well-known results about our formalism that we need, such as the [[normal form theorem]] or the [[soundness theorem]].\n\nWe axiomatize predicate calculus ''without equality'' (sometimes confusingly called ''without identity''), i.e. there are no special axioms expressing the properties of (object) equality as a special relation symbol. After the basic form of the theorem has been proved, it will be easy to extend it to the case of predicate calculus ''with equality''.\n\n==Statement of the theorem and its proof==\n\nIn the following, we state two equivalent forms of the theorem, and show their equivalence.\n\nLater, we prove the theorem. This is done in the following steps:\n\n# Reducing the theorem to sentences (formulas with no free variables) in [[prenex form]], i.e. with all [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s ({{math|&forall;}} and {{math|&exist;}}) at the beginning. Furthermore, we reduce it to formulas whose first quantifier is {{math|&forall;}}. This is possible because for every sentence, there is an equivalent one in prenex form whose first quantifier is {{math|&forall;}}.\n# Reducing the theorem to sentences of the form {{math|&forall;<var>x<sub>1</sub></var>&forall;<var>x<sub>2</sub></var>...&forall;<var>x<sub>k</sub></var> &exist;<var>y<sub>1</sub></var>&exist;<var>y<sub>2</sub></var>...&exist;<var>y<sub>m</sub></var> &phi;(<var>x<sub>1</sub></var>...<var>x<sub>k</sub></var>, <var>y<sub>1</sub></var>...<var>y<sub>m</sub></var>)}}. While we cannot do this by simply rearranging the quantifiers, we show that it is yet enough to prove the theorem for sentences of that form.\n# Finally we prove the theorem for sentences of that form.\n#* This is done by first noting that a sentence such as {{math|<var>B</var> {{=}} &forall;<var>x<sub>1</sub></var>&forall;<var>x<sub>2</sub></var>...&forall;<var>x<sub>k</sub></var> &exist;<var>y<sub>1</sub></var>&exist;<var>y<sub>2</sub></var>...&exist;<var>y<sub>m</sub></var> &phi;(<var>x<sub>1</sub></var>...<var>x<sub>k</sub></var>, <var>y<sub>1</sub></var>...<var>y<sub>m</sub></var>) }} is either refutable (its negation is always true) or satisfiable, i.e. there is some model in which it holds (it might even be always true, i.e. a tautology); this model is simply assigning [[truth value]]s to the subpropositions from which B is built.  The reason for that is the completeness of [[propositional logic]], with the existential quantifiers playing no role.\n#* We extend this result to more and more complex and lengthy sentences, D<sub>n</sub> (n=1,2...), built out from B, so that either any of them is refutable and therefore so is \u03c6, or all of them are not refutable and therefore each holds in some model.\n#* We finally use the models in which the D<sub>n</sub> hold (in case all are not refutable) in order to build a model in which \u03c6 holds.\n\n===Theorem 1. Every valid formula (true in all structures) is provable.===\n\nThis is the most basic form of the completeness theorem. We immediately restate it in a form more convenient for our purposes:\nWhen we say \"all structures\", it is important to specify that the structures involved are classical (Tarskian) interpretations I, where I=<U,F> (U is a non-empty (possibly infinite) set of objects, whereas F is a set of functions from expressions of the interpreted symbolism into U). [By contrast, so-called \"free logics\" countenance possibly empty sets for U. For more regarding free logics, see the work of Karel Lambert.]\n\n===Theorem 2. Every formula &phi; is either refutable or satisfiable in some structure.===\n\n\"&phi; is refutable\" means ''by definition'' \"\u00ac&phi; is provable\".\n\n===Equivalence of both theorems===\n\nTo see the equivalence, note first that if '''Theorem 1''' holds, and \u03c6 is not satisfiable in any structure, then \u00ac\u03c6 is valid in all structures and therefore provable, thus \u03c6 is refutable and '''Theorem 2''' holds. If on the other hand '''Theorem 2''' holds and \u03c6 is valid in all structures, then \u00ac\u03c6 is not satisfiable in any structure and therefore refutable; then \u00ac\u00ac\u03c6 is provable and then so is \u03c6, thus '''Theorem 1''' holds.\n\n===Proof of theorem 2: first step===\n\nWe approach the proof of '''Theorem 2''' by successively restricting the class of all formulas \u03c6 for which we need to prove \"&phi; is either refutable or satisfiable\". At the beginning we need to prove this for all possible formulas \u03c6 in our language. However, suppose that for every formula \u03c6 there is some formula \u03c8 taken from a more restricted class of formulas '''C''', such that \"&psi; is either refutable or satisfiable\" \u2192 \"&phi; is either refutable or satisfiable\". Then, once this claim (expressed in the previous sentence) is proved, it will suffice to prove \"&phi; is either refutable or satisfiable\" only for \u03c6's belonging to the class '''C'''. Note also that if \u03c6 is provably equivalent to \u03c8 (''i.e.'', (\u03c6\u2261\u03c8) is provable), then it is indeed the case that \"&psi; is either refutable or satisfiable\"  \u2192 \"&phi; is either refutable or satisfiable\" (the [[soundness theorem]] is needed to show this).\n\nThere are standard techniques for rewriting an arbitrary formula into one that does not use function or constant symbols, at the cost of introducing additional quantifiers; we will therefore assume that all formulas are free of such symbols. G\u00f6del's paper uses a version of first-order predicate calculus that has no function or constant symbols to begin with.\n\nNext we consider a generic formula \u03c6 (which no longer uses function or constant symbols) and apply the [[prenex form]] theorem to find a formula \u03c8 in ''normal form'' such that \u03c6\u2261\u03c8 (\u03c8 being in ''normal form'' means that all the quantifiers in \u03c8, if there are any, are found at the very beginning of \u03c8). It follows now that we need only prove '''Theorem 2''' for formulas \u03c6 in normal form.\n\nNext, we eliminate all free variables from \u03c6 by quantifying them existentially: if, say, '''x<sub>1</sub>...x<sub>n</sub>''' are free in \u03c6, we form <math>\\psi=\\exists x_1 ... \\exists x_n \\phi</math>. If \u03c8 is satisfiable in a structure M, then certainly so is \u03c6 and if \u03c8 is refutable, then <math>\\neg \\psi = \\forall x_1 ... \\forall x_n \\neg \\phi</math> is provable, and then so is \u00ac\u03c6, thus \u03c6 is refutable. We see that we can restrict \u03c6 to be a ''sentence'', that is, a formula with no free variables.\n\nFinally, we would like, for reasons of technical convenience, that the ''prefix'' of \u03c6 (that is, the string of quantifiers at the beginning of \u03c6, which is in normal form)  begin with a universal quantifier and end with an existential quantifier. To achieve this for a generic \u03c6 (subject to restrictions we have already proved), we take some one-place relation symbol '''F''' unused in \u03c6, and two new variables '''y''' and '''z'''.. If \u03c6 = '''(P)\u03a6''', where (P) stands for the prefix of \u03c6 and \u03a6 for the ''matrix'' (the remaining, quantifier-free part of \u03c6) we form <math>\\psi = \\forall y (P) \\exists z ( \\Phi \\wedge [ F(y) \\vee \\neg F(z) ] )</math>. Since <math>\\forall y \\exists z ( F(y) \\vee \\neg F(z) )</math> is clearly provable, it is easy to see that <math>\\phi=\\psi</math> is provable.\n\n===Reducing the theorem to formulas of degree 1===\n\nOur generic formula \u03c6 now is a sentence, in normal form, and its prefix starts with a universal quantifier and ends with an existential quantifier. Let us call the class of all such formulas '''R'''. We are faced with proving that every formula in '''R''' is either refutable or satisfiable. Given our formula \u03c6, we group strings of quantifiers of one kind together in blocks:\n\n:<math>\\phi = (\\forall x_1 ... \\forall x_{k_1})(\\exists x_{k_1+1} ... \\exists x_{k_2}).......(\\forall x_{k_{n-2}+1} ... \\forall x_{k_{n-1}})(\\exists x_{k_{n-1}+1} ... \\exists x_{k_n}) (\\Phi)</math>\n\nWe define the '''degree''' of <math>\\phi</math> to be the number of universal quantifier blocks, separated by existential quantifier blocks as shown above, in the prefix of <math>\\phi</math>. The following lemma, which G\u00f6del adapted from Skolem's proof of the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]], lets us sharply reduce the complexity of the generic formula <math>\\phi</math> we need to prove the theorem for:\n\n'''Lemma'''. Let '''k'''>=1. If every formula in '''R''' of degree '''k''' is either refutable or satisfiable, then so is every formula in '''R''' of degree '''k+1'''.\n\n:'''Comment''': Take a formula &phi; of degree k+1 of the form <math>\\phi = (\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\forall u)(\\exist v) (P) \\psi</math>, where <math>(P)\\psi</math> is the remainder of <math>\\phi</math> (it is thus of degree '''k-1'''). &phi; states that for every x there is a y such that... (something). It would have been nice to have a predicate ''Q' '' so that for every x, ''Q'(x,y)'' would be true if and only if y is the required one to make (something) true. Then we could have written a formula of degree k, which is equivalent to &phi;, namely <math>(\\forall x')(\\forall x)(\\forall y)(\\forall u)(\\exist v)(\\exist y') (P) Q'(x',y') \\wedge (Q'(x,y) \\rightarrow \\psi)</math>. This formula is indeed equivalent to &phi; because it states that for every x, if there is a y that satisfies Q'(x,y), then (something) holds, and furthermore, we know that there is such a y, because for every x', there is a y' that satisfies Q'(x',y'). Therefore &phi; follows from this formula. It is also easy to show that if the formula is false, then so is &phi;. '''Unfortunately''', in general there is no such predicate Q'. However, this idea can be understood as a basis for the following proof of the Lemma.\n\n'''Proof.''' Let \u03c6 be a formula of degree '''k+1'''; then we can write it as\n\n:<math>\\phi = (\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\forall u)(\\exist v) (P) \\psi</math>\n\nwhere '''(P)''' is the remainder of the prefix of <math>\\phi</math> (it is thus of degree '''k-1''') and <math>\\psi</math> is the quantifier-free matrix of <math>\\phi</math>. '''x''', '''y''', '''u''' and '''v''' denote here ''tuples'' of variables rather than single variables; ''e.g.'' <math>(\\forall x)</math> really stands for  <math>\\forall x_1 \\forall x_2 ... \\forall x_n</math> where <math>x_1 ... x_n</math> are some distinct variables.\n\nLet now '''x'''' and '''y'''' be tuples of previously unused variables of the same length as '''x''' and '''y''' respectively, and let '''Q''' be a previously unused relation symbol that takes as many arguments as the sum of lengths of '''x''' and '''y'''; we consider the formula\n\n:<math>\\Phi = (\\forall x')(\\exists y') Q(x',y') \\wedge (\\forall x)(\\forall y)( Q(x,y) \\rightarrow (\\forall u)(\\exist v)(P)\\psi )</math>\n\nClearly, <math>\\Phi \\rightarrow \\phi</math> is provable.\n\nNow since the string of quantifiers <math>(\\forall u)(\\exists v)(P)</math> does not contain variables from '''x''' or '''y''', the following equivalence is easily provable with the help of whatever formalism we're using:\n\n:<math>( Q(x,y) \\rightarrow (\\forall u )(\\exists v)(P) \\psi) \\equiv (\\forall u)(\\exists v)(P) ( Q(x,y) \\rightarrow \\psi )</math>\n\nAnd since these two formulas are equivalent, if we replace the first with the second inside \u03a6, we obtain the formula \u03a6' such that \u03a6\u2261\u03a6':\n\n:<math>\\Phi' = (\\forall x')(\\exist y') Q(x',y') \\wedge (\\forall x)(\\forall y) (\\forall u)(\\exists v)(P) ( Q(x,y) \\rightarrow \\psi )</math>\n\nNow \u03a6' has the form <math>(S)\\rho \\wedge (S')\\rho'</math>, where '''(S)''' and '''(S')''' are some quantifier strings, \u03c1 and \u03c1' are quantifier-free, and, '''furthermore''', no variable of '''(S)''' occurs in \u03c1' and no variable of '''(S')''' occurs in \u03c1. Under such conditions every formula of the form <math>(T)(\\rho \\wedge \\rho')</math>, where '''(T)''' is a string of quantifiers containing all quantifiers in (S) and (S') interleaved among themselves in any fashion, but maintaining the relative order inside (S) and (S'), will be equivalent to the original formula \u03a6'(this is yet another basic result in first-order predicate calculus that we rely on). To wit, we form \u03a8 as follows:\n:<math>\\Psi = (\\forall x')(\\forall x)(\\forall y) (\\forall u)(\\exists y')(\\exists v)(P)Q(x',y') \\wedge (Q(x,y) \\rightarrow \\psi )</math>\n\nand we have <math>\\Phi' \\equiv \\Psi</math>.\n\nNow <math>\\Psi</math> is a formula of degree '''k''' and therefore by assumption either refutable or satisfiable.\nIf <math>\\Psi</math> is satisfiable in a structure '''M''', then, considering <math>\\Psi \\equiv \\Phi' \\equiv \\Phi \\wedge \\Phi \\rightarrow \\phi</math>, we see that <math>\\phi</math> is satisfiable as well.\nIf <math>\\Psi</math> is refutable, then so is <math>\\Phi</math>, which is equivalent to it; thus <math>\\neg \\Phi</math> is provable.\nNow we can replace all occurrences of Q inside the provable formula <math>\\neg \\Phi</math> by some other formula dependent on the same variables, and we will still get a provable formula.\n(''This is yet another basic result of first-order predicate calculus. Depending on the particular formalism adopted for the calculus, it may be seen as a simple application of a \"functional substitution\" rule of inference, as in G\u00f6del's paper, or it may be proved by considering the formal proof of <math>\\neg \\Phi</math>, replacing in it all occurrences of Q by some other formula with the same free variables, and noting that all logical axioms in the formal proof remain logical axioms after the substitution, and all rules of inference still apply in the same way.'')\n\nIn this particular case, we replace Q(x',y') in <math>\\neg \\Phi</math> with the formula <math>(\\forall u)(\\exists v)(P)\\psi(x,y|x',y')</math>. Here (x,y|x',y') means that instead of \u03c8 we are writing a different formula, in which x and y are replaced with x' and y'. Note that Q(x,y) is simply replaced by <math>(\\forall u)(\\exists v)(P)\\psi</math>.\n\n<math>\\neg \\Phi</math> then becomes\n\n:<math>\\neg ( (\\forall x')(\\exists y') (\\forall u)(\\exists v)(P)\\psi(x,y|x',y') \\wedge (\\forall x)(\\forall y) ( (\\forall u)(\\exists v)(P)\\psi \\rightarrow (\\forall u)(\\exists v)(P) \\psi ) )</math>\n\nand this formula is provable; since the part under negation and after the <math>\\wedge</math> sign is obviously provable, and the part under negation and before the <math>\\wedge</math> sign is obviously \u03c6, just with '''x''' and '''y''' replaced by '''x'''' and '''y'''', we see that <math>\\neg \\phi</math> is provable, and \u03c6 is refutable. We have proved that \u03c6 is either satisfiable or refutable, and this concludes the proof of the '''Lemma'''.\n\nNotice that we could not have used <math>(\\forall u)(\\exists v)(P)\\psi(x,y|x',y')</math> instead of Q(x',y') from the beginning, because <math>\\Psi</math> would not have been a [[well-formed formula]] in that case. This is why we cannot naively use the argument appearing at the comment that precedes the proof.\n\n===Proving the theorem for formulas of degree 1===\nAs shown by the '''Lemma''' above, we only need to prove our theorem for formulas \u03c6 in '''R''' of degree 1. \u03c6 cannot be of degree 0, since formulas in R have no free variables and don't use constant symbols. So the formula \u03c6 has the general form:\n\n:<math> (\\forall x_1...x_k)(\\exists y_1...y_m) \\phi(x_1...x_k, y_1...y_m).</math>\n\nNow we define an ordering of the k-[[tuple]]s of [[natural number]]s as follows: <math> (x_1...x_k) < (y_1...y_k) </math> should hold if either <math> \\Sigma_k (x_1...x_k) < \\Sigma_k (y_1...y_k) </math>, or <math> \\Sigma_k (x_1...x_k) = \\Sigma_k (y_1...y_k) </math>, and  <math> (x_1...x_k) </math> precedes <math> (y_1...y_k) </math> in [[lexicographic order]]. [Here <math> \\Sigma_k (x_1...x_k) </math> denotes the sum of the terms of the tuple.] Denote the nth tuple in this order by <math> (a^n_1...a^n_k) </math>.\n\nSet the formula <math> B_n </math> as <math> \\phi(z_{a^n_1}...z_{a^n_k}, z_{(n-1)m+2}, z_{(n-1)m+3}...z_{nm+1}) </math>. Then put <math>D_n</math> as \n:<math> (\\exists z_1...z_{nm+1}) (B_1 \\wedge B_2 ... \\wedge B_n).</math>\n\n'''Lemma''': For every ''n'', \u03c6<math> \\rightarrow D_n</math>.\n\n'''Proof''': By induction on n; we have <math> D_k \\Leftarrow D_{k-1} \\wedge (\\forall z_1...z_{(n-1)m+1})(\\exists z_{(n-1)m+2}...z_{nm+1}) B_n \\Leftarrow D_{k-1} \\wedge (\\forall z_{a^n_1}...z_{a^n_k})(\\exists y_1...y_m) \\phi(z_{a^n_1}...z_{a^n_k}, y_1...y_m) </math>, where the latter implication holds by variable substitution, since the ordering of the tuples is such that <math>(\\forall k)({a^n_1}...{a^n_k}) < (n-1)m + 2</math>. But the last formula is equivalent to <math> D_{k-1} \\wedge </math>\u03c6.\n\nFor the base case, <math> D_1 \\equiv (\\exists z_1...z_{m+1}) \\phi(z_{a^1_1}...z_{a^1_k}, z_2, z_3...z_{m+1}) \\equiv (\\exists z_1...z_{m+1}) \\phi(z_1...z_1, z_2, z_3...z_{m+1}) </math> is obviously a corollary of \u03c6 as well. So the '''Lemma''' is proven.\n\nNow if <math> D_n </math> is refutable for some ''n'', it follows that \u03c6 is refutable. On the other hand, suppose that <math> D_n </math> is not refutable for any ''n''. Then for each ''n'' there is some way of assigning truth values to the distinct subpropositions <math>E_h</math> (ordered by their first appearance in <math>D_n</math>; \"distinct\" here means either distinct predicates, or distinct bound variables) in <math> B_k </math>, such that <math> D_n </math> will be true when each proposition is evaluated in this fashion. This follows from the completeness of the underlying [[propositional logic]].\n\nWe will now show that there is such an assignment of truth values to <math>E_h</math>, so that all <math>D_n</math> will be true: The <math>E_h</math> appear in the same order in every <math> D_n </math>; we will inductively define a general assignment to them by a sort of \"majority vote\": Since there are infinitely many assignments (one for each <math> D_n </math>) affecting <math>E_1</math>, either infinitely many make <math>E_1</math> true, or infinitely many make it false and only finitely many make it true. In the former case, we choose <math>E_1</math> to be true in general; in the latter we take it to be false in general. Then from the infinitely many ''n'' for which <math>E_1</math> through <math>E_{h-1}</math> are assigned the same truth value as in the general assignment, we pick a general assignment to <math>E_h</math> in the same fashion.\n\nThis general assignment must lead to every one of the <math>B_k</math> and <math>D_k</math> being true, since if one of the <math>B_k</math> were false under the general assignment, <math>D_n</math> would also be false for every ''n > k''. But this contradicts the fact that for the finite collection of general <math>E_h</math> assignments appearing in <math>D_k</math>, there are infinitely many ''n'' where the assignment making <math>D_n</math> true matches the general assignment.\n\nFrom this general assignment, which makes all of the <math>D_k</math> true, we construct an interpretation of the language's predicates that makes \u03c6 true. The universe of the model will be the [[natural numbers]]. Each i-ary predicate <math>\\Psi</math> should be true of the naturals <math>(u_1...u_i)</math> precisely when the proposition <math>\\Psi(z_{u_1}...z_{u_i})</math> is either true in the general assignment, or not assigned by it (because it never appears in any of the <math>D_k</math>).\n\nIn this model, each of the formulas <math> (\\exists y_1...y_m) \\phi(a^n_1...a^n_k, y_1...y_m) </math> is true by construction. But this implies that \u03c6 itself is true in the model, since the <math>a^n</math> range over all possible k-tuples of natural numbers. So \u03c6 is satisfiable, and we are done.\n\n====Intuitive explanation====\nWe may write each B<sub>i</sub> as \u03a6(x<sub>1</sub>...x<sub>k</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>...y<sub>m</sub>) for some x-s, which we may call \"first arguments\" and y-s that we may call \"last arguments\".\n\nTake B<sub>1</sub> for example. Its \"last arguments\" are z<sub>2</sub>,z<sub>3</sub>...z<sub>m+1</sub>, and for every possible combination of k of these variables there is some j so that they appear as \"first arguments\" in B<sub>j</sub>. Thus for large enough n<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>n<sub>1</sub></sub> has the property that the \"last arguments\" of B<sub>1</sub> appear, in every possible combinations of k of them, as \"first arguments\" in other B<sub>j</sub>-s within D<sub>n</sub>. For every B<sub>i</sub> there is a D<sub>n<sub>i</sub></sub> with the corresponding property.\n\nTherefore in a model that satisfies all the D<sub>n</sub>-s, there are objects corresponding to z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>... and each combination of k of these appear as \"first arguments\" in some B<sub>j</sub>, meaning that for every k of these objects z<sub>p<sub>1</sub></sub>...z<sub>p<sub>k</sub></sub> there are z<sub>q<sub>1</sub></sub>...z<sub>q<sub>m</sub></sub>, which makes \u03a6(z<sub>p<sub>1</sub></sub>...z<sub>p<sub>k</sub></sub>,z<sub>q<sub>1</sub></sub>...z<sub>q<sub>m</sub></sub>) satisfied. By taking a submodel with only these z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>... objects, we have a model satisfying \u03c6.\n\n==Extensions==\n\n===Extension to first-order predicate calculus with equality===\nG\u00f6del reduced a formula containing instances of the equality predicate to ones without it in an extended language. His method involves replacing a formula \u03c6 containing some instances of equality with the formula\n\n: <math> (\\forall x) Eq(x, x) \\wedge (\\forall x,y,z) [Eq(x, y) \\rightarrow (Eq(x, z) \\rightarrow Eq(y, z))] </math> <math> \\wedge (\\forall x,y,z) [Eq(x, y) \\rightarrow (Eq(z, x) \\rightarrow Eq(z, y))] </math> <br> <math> \\wedge </math> <br> <math> (\\forall x_1...x_k, y_1...x_k) [(Eq(x_1, y_1) \\wedge ... \\wedge Eq(x_k, y_k)) \\rightarrow (A(x_1...x_k) \\equiv A(y_1...y_k))] </math> <br> <math> \\wedge  ... \\wedge </math> <br> <math> (\\forall x_1...x_m, y_1...x_m) [(Eq(x_1, y_1) \\wedge ... \\wedge Eq(x_m, y_m)) \\rightarrow (Z(x_1...x_m) \\equiv Z(y_1...y_m))] </math> <br> <math> \\wedge </math> <br> <math> \\varphi'.</math>\n\nHere <math>A ... Z</math> denote the predicates appearing in \u03c6 (with <math>k ... m</math> their respective arities), and \u03c6' is the formula \u03c6 with all occurrences of equality replaced with the new predicate ''Eq''. If this new formula is refutable, the original \u03c6 was as well; the same is true of satisfiability, since we may take a quotient of satisfying model of the new formula by the equivalence relation representing ''Eq''. This quotient is well-defined with respect to the other predicates, and therefore will satisfy the original formula \u03c6.\n\n===Extension to countable sets of formulas===\n\nG\u00f6del also considered the case where there are a countably infinite collection of formulas. Using the same reductions as above, he was able to consider only those cases where each formula is of degree 1 and contains no uses of equality. For a countable collection of formulas <math> \\phi^i </math> of degree 1, we may define <math> B^i_k </math> as above; then define <math> D_k </math> to be the closure of <math> B^1_1...B^1_k, ..., B^k_1...B^k_k </math>. The remainder of the proof then went through as before.\n\n===Extension to arbitrary sets of formulas===\n\nWhen there is an uncountably infinite collection of formulas, the [[Axiom of Choice]] (or at least some weak form of it) is needed. Using the full AC, one can [[well-order]] the formulas, and prove the uncountable case with the same argument as the countable one, except with [[transfinite induction]]. Other approaches can be used to prove that the completeness theorem in this case is equivalent to the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]], a weak form of AC.\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal\n |last=G\u00f6del |first=K |authorlink=Kurt G\u00f6del\n |year=1929 \n |title=\u00dcber die Vollst\u00e4ndigkeit des Logikkalk\u00fcls\n |version=Doctoral dissertation |publisher=University Of Vienna. \n}} The first proof of the completeness theorem.\n* {{cite journal\n |last=G\u00f6del |first=K |authorlink=Kurt G\u00f6del\n |title=Die Vollst\u00e4ndigkeit der Axiome des logischen Funktionenkalk\u00fcls\n |language=German\n |journal=Monatshefte f\u00fcr Mathematik\n |volume=37\n |issue=1 |pages=349&ndash;360 |year=1930\n |doi=10.1007/BF01696781\n |jfm=56.0046.04\n}} The same material as the dissertation, except with briefer proofs, more succinct explanations, and omitting the lengthy introduction.\n\n==External links==\n*[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/ Kurt G\u00f6del]\"\u2014by Juliette Kennedy.\n*MacTutor biography: [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Godel.html Kurt G\u00f6del.]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Original proof of Godel's completeness theorem}}\n[[Category:Logic]]\n[[Category:Model theory|Godel's completeness theorem]]\n[[Category:Mathematical proofs]]\n[[Category:Mathematical logic|Godel's completeness theorem]]\n[[Category:Proof theory|Godel's completeness theorem]]\n[[Category:Works by Kurt G\u00f6del]]", "sha1": "3ju7v1qv6l8b4w6lh9cjx0vlb9nnis3"}}, {"title": "Gerdur Gymisdottir", "ns": "0", "id": "12728", "redirect": {"title": "Ger\u00f0r"}, "revision": {"id": "205992642", "parentid": "15910395", "timestamp": "2008-04-16T10:45:17Z", "contributor": {"username": "Scepbot", "id": "1559905"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot: Fixing double redirect", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Ger\u00f0r]]", "sha1": "no2pdalfj9bt75gx7xbbi5dm4xa7yqo"}}, {"title": "Grits", "ns": "0", "id": "12729", "revision": {"id": "865067369", "parentid": "864874645", "timestamp": "2018-10-21T14:16:59Z", "contributor": {"username": "Joyous!", "id": "69412"}, "comment": "rmvd descriptive sentence", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About||the Canadian Political party colloquially known as the Grits|Liberal Party of Canada||Grit (disambiguation)}}\n{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}\n{{Infobox prepared food\n| name            = Grits\n| image           = Grits1.jpg\n| caption         = Grits, as a breakfast side-dish with [[bacon]], [[scrambled eggs]] and [[toast]]\n| type            = [[Porridge]]\n| main_ingredient = Ground corn\n| country         = [[United States|America]]\n| variations      ='''Hominy grits''' <br /> '''Yellow speckled grits''' <br /> '''Cheese grits'''\n}}\n[[File:Grits with cheese, bacon, green onion and poached egg.jpg|thumb|Grits with cheese, bacon, green onion and poached egg]]\n\n'''Grits''' is a food made from corn ([[maize]]) that is ground into a coarse meal and then boiled.

Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]].

There are four known giant planets in the [[Solar System]]: [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. Many [[exoplanet|extrasolar]] giant planets have been identified orbiting other [[star]]s.\n\nGiant planets are also sometimes called '''jovian planets''', after Jupiter. They are also sometimes known as [[gas giant]]s.

Arguably it is something of a misnomer, because throughout most of the volume of these planets the pressure is so high that matter is not in gaseous form.<ref name=ddl2011>{{cite book|last=D'Angelo|first=G.|author2=Durisen, R.

''Fluid planet'' would be a more accurate term. Jupiter also has [[metallic hydrogen]] near its center, but much of its volume is hydrogen, helium, and traces of other gases above their critical points. The observable atmospheres of all these planets (at less than unit [[optical depth]]) are quite thin compared to their radii, only extending perhaps one percent of the way to the center. Thus the observable portions are gaseous (in contrast to [[Mars]] and Earth, which have gaseous atmospheres through which the crust can be seen).\n\nThe rather misleading term has caught on because planetary scientists typically use ''rock'', ''gas'', and ''ice'' as shorthands for classes of elements and compounds commonly found as planetary constituents, irrespective of what [[phase of matter|phase]] the matter may appear in. In the outer Solar System, hydrogen and helium are referred to as ''gases''; water, methane, and ammonia as ''ices''; and silicates and metals as ''rock''. When deep planetary interiors are considered, it may not be far off to say that, by ''ice'' astronomers mean [[oxygen]] and [[carbon]], by ''rock'' they mean [[silicon]], and by ''gas'' they mean hydrogen and helium. The many ways in which Uranus and Neptune differ from Jupiter and Saturn have led some to use the term only for the planets similar to the latter two. With this terminology in mind, some astronomers have started referring to Uranus and Neptune as [[ice giant]]s to indicate the predominance of the ''ices'' (in fluid form) in their interior composition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Formation of Giant Planets |author1=Jack J.

Spiegel, Adam Burrows, John A. Milsom</ref> The [[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] includes objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, and the [[Exoplanet Data Explorer]] up to 24 Jupiter masses.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Gas Giant Interiors.jpg|thumb|400px|right|thumb|These cut-aways illustrate interior models of the giant planets. Jupiter is shown with a rocky core overlaid by a deep layer of [[metallic hydrogen]].]]\nA giant planet is a massive [[planet]] and has a thick atmosphere of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]. They may have a dense molten core of rocky elements, or the core may have completely dissolved and dispersed throughout the planet if the planet is hot enough.<ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6309 Rocky core solubility in Jupiter and giant exoplanets], Hugh F. Wilson, Burkhard Militzer, 2011</ref> In \"traditional\" giant planets such as [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] (the gas giants) hydrogen and helium constitute most of the mass of the planet, whereas they only make up an outer envelope on [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], which are instead mostly composed of [[water]], [[ammonia]], and [[methane]] and therefore increasingly referred to as \"[[ice giant]]s\".\n\nExtrasolar giant planets that orbit very close to their stars are the [[exoplanet]]s that are easiest to detect. These are called [[hot Jupiter]]s and [[hot Neptune]]s because they have very high surface temperatures. Hot Jupiters were, until the advent of space-borne telescopes, the most common form of exoplanet known, due to the relative ease of detecting them with ground-based instruments.\n\nGiant planets are commonly said to lack solid surfaces, but it is more accurate to say that they lack surfaces altogether since the gases that constitute them simply become thinner and thinner with increasing distance from the planets' centers, eventually becoming indistinguishable from the interplanetary medium. Therefore, landing on a giant planet may or may not be possible, depending on the size and composition of its core.\n\n==Subtypes==\n\n===Gas giants===\n{{Main article|Gas giant}}\n[[File:Saturn north polar vortex 2012-11-27.jpg|thumb|right|Saturn's north polar vortex]]\nGas giants consist mostly of hydrogen and helium. The Solar System's gas giants, [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], have heavier elements making up between 3 and 13 percent of their mass.<ref name=\"Guillot\">The Interior of Jupiter, Guillot et al., in ''Jupiter: The Planet, Satellites and Magnetosphere'', Bagenal et al., editors, Cambridge University Press, 2004</ref> Gas giants are thought to consist of an outer layer of [[molecular hydrogen]], surrounding a layer of liquid [[metallic hydrogen]], with a probable molten core with a rocky composition.\n\nJupiter and Saturn's outermost portion of the hydrogen atmosphere has many layers of visible clouds that are mostly composed of water and ammonia. The layer of metallic hydrogen makes up the bulk of each planet, and is referred to as \"metallic\" because the very high pressure turns hydrogen into an electrical conductor. The core is thought to consist of heavier elements at such high temperatures (20,000 K) and pressures that their properties are poorly understood.<ref name=\"Guillot\"/>\n\n===Ice giants===\n{{Main article|Ice giant}}\n\nIce giants have distinctly different interior compositions from gas giants. The Solar System's ice giants, [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere that extends from the cloud tops down to about 80% (Uranus) or 85% (Neptune) of their radius. Below this, they are predominantly \"icy\", i.e. consist mostly of water, methane, and ammonia. There is also some rock and gas, but various proportions of ice\u2013rock\u2013gas could mimic pure ice, so that the exact proportions are unknown.<ref>{{cite book |author1=L. McFadden |author2=P. Weissman |author3=T. Johnson | title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System (2nd ed.) | publisher=[[Academic Press]] | date=2007 | isbn=978-0-12-088589-3}}</ref>\n\nUranus and Neptune have very hazy atmospheric layers with small amounts of methane, giving them aquamarine colors; light blue and ultramarine respectively.{{Clarify|date=December 2014|only methane is mentioned}} Both have magnetic fields that are sharply inclined to their axes of rotation.\n\nUnlike the other giant planets, Uranus has an extreme tilt that causes its seasons to be severely pronounced. The two planets also have other subtle but important differences. Uranus has more hydrogen and helium than Neptune despite being less massive overall. Neptune is therefore denser and has much more internal heat and a more active atmosphere. The [[Nice model]], in fact, suggests that Neptune formed closer to the [[Sun]] than Uranus did, and should therefore have more heavy elements.\n\n===Massive solid planets===\n\n[[Exoplanet#Massive solid planets|Massive solid planets]] can also exist. For example, Kepler-10c is composed of mostly of rock with possibly up to 20% high-pressure water ice, but does have a hydrogen-dominated envelope.\n\nSolid planets up to thousands of Earth masses may be able to form around massive stars ([[B-type main-sequence star|B-type]] and [[O-type main-sequence star|O-type]] stars; 5\u2013120 solar masses), where the [[protoplanetary disk]] would contain enough heavy elements. Also, these stars have high [[UV radiation]] and [[stellar wind|winds]] that could [[Photoevaporation|photoevaporate]] the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements.<ref name=\"mass/radius sold\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/521346| title = Mass\u2010Radius Relationships for Solid Exoplanets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 669| issue = 2| pages = 1279\u20131297| year = 2007| last1 = Seager | first1 = S.| last2 = Kuchner | first2 = M.| last3 = Hier\u2010Majumder | first3 = C.

Because these large planets are inferred to share more in common with Jupiter than with the other giant planets, some have claimed that \"jovian planet\" is a more accurate term for them. Many of the exoplanets are much closer to their parent stars and hence much hotter than the giant planets in the Solar System, making it possible that some of those planets are a type not observed in the Solar System. Considering the relative [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundances of the elements in the universe]] (approximately 98% hydrogen and helium) it would be surprising to find a predominantly rocky planet more massive than Jupiter. On the other hand, models of planetary-system formation have suggested that giant planets would be inhibited from forming as close to their stars as many of the extrasolar giant planets have been observed to orbit.\n\n==Atmospheres==\nThe bands seen in the [[atmosphere of Jupiter]] are due to counter-circulating streams of material called zones and belts, encircling the planet parallel to its equator. The zones are the lighter bands, and are at higher altitudes in the atmosphere. They have an internal updraft and are high-pressure regions. The belts are the darker bands, are lower in the atmosphere, and have an internal downdraft. They are low-pressure regions. These structures are somewhat analogous to the high and low-pressure cells in Earth's atmosphere, but they have a very different structure\u2014latitudinal bands that circle the entire planet, as opposed to small confined cells of pressure. This appears to be a result of the rapid rotation and underlying symmetry of the planet.

Female deities also play heavily into the Norse concept of death, where half of those slain in battle enter Freyja's field [[F\u00f3lkvangr]], [[Hel (being)|Hel]]'s realm [[Hel (location)|of the same name]], and [[R\u00e1n]] who receives those who die at sea.

[[Shaktas]], worshippers of the Goddess, equate this god with Devi, the mother goddess. Such aspects of one god as male god ([[Shaktiman]]) and female energy (Shakti), working as a pair are often envisioned as male gods and their wives or consorts and provide many analogues between passive male ground and dynamic female energy.\n\nFor example, [[Brahma]] pairs with [[Sarasvati]]. Shiva likewise pairs with [[Parvati]] who later is represented through a number of [[Avatar]]s (incarnations): [[Dakshayani|Sati]] and the warrior figures, [[Durga]] and [[Kali]]. All goddesses in Hinduism are sometimes grouped together as the great goddess, Devi.\n\nThe ''Shaktis'' took a further step. Their ideology, based mainly on [[tantra]]s, sees Shakti as the principle of energy through which all divinity functions, thus showing the masculine as depending on the feminine. In the great shakta scripture known as the [[Devi Mahatmya]], all the goddesses are aspects of one presiding female force\u2014one in truth and many in expression\u2014giving the world and the cosmos the galvanic energy for motion. It expresses through philosophical tracts and metaphor, that the potentiality of masculine being is actuated by the feminine divine. More recently, the Indian author Rajesh Talwar has critiqued Western religion and written eloquently on the sacred feminine in the context of the North Indian Goddess Vaishno Devi.<ref>http://www.kalpazpublications.com/index.php?p=sr&Uc=9788178355900&l=0</ref>\n\nLocal deities of different village regions in [[India]] were often identified with \"mainstream\" Hindu deities, a process that has been called ''Sanskritization''. Others attribute it to the influence of [[monism]] or ''Advaita'', which discounts polytheist or monotheist categorization.\n\nWhile the monist forces have led to a fusion between some of the goddesses (108 names are common for many goddesses), centrifugal forces have also resulted in new goddesses and rituals gaining ascendance among the laity in different parts of Hindu world. Thus, the immensely popular goddess [[Durga]] was a pre-Vedic goddess who was later fused with Parvati, a process that can be traced through texts such as Kalika Purana (10th century), Durgabhaktitarangini ([[Vidyapati]] 15th century), Chandimangal (16th century) etc.\n\n==Abrahamic religions==\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Further|The Hebrew Goddess|Shekhinah}}\nAccording to [[Zohar]], [[Lilith]] is the name of [[Adam]]'s first wife, who was created at the same time as Adam. She left [[Adam]] and refused to return to the [[Garden of Eden]] after she mated with [[archangel]] [[Samael]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://istina.rin.ru/eng/ufo/text/663.html|title=Samael & Lilith - Unexplained - IN SEARCH FOR TRUTH|work=rin.ru}}</ref> Her story was greatly developed during the [[Middle Ages]] in the tradition of [[Aggadic midrashim]], the [[Zohar]] and [[Jewish mysticism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=Howard|title=Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195358708|page=218}}</ref>\n\nThe Zohar tradition has influenced [[Jewish mythology|Jewish folkore]], which postulates God created Adam to marry a woman named [[Lilith]]. Outside of Jewish tradition, Lilith was associated with the [[Mother Goddess]], [[Inanna]] \u2013 later known as both [[Ishtar]] and [[Asherah]]. In The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], Gilgamesh was said to have destroyed a tree that was in a sacred grove dedicated to the goddess Ishtar/Inanna/[[Asherah]]. Lilith ran into the wilderness in despair. She then is depicted in the Talmud and [[Kabbalah]] as first wife to God's first creation of man, [[Adam]]. In time, as stated in the Old Testament, the Hebrew followers continued to worship \"False Idols\", like [[Asherah]], as being as powerful as God. [[Jeremiah]] speaks of his (and God's) displeasure at this behavior to the Hebrew people about the worship of the goddess in the Old Testament. Lilith is banished from Adam and God's presence when she is discovered to be a \"demon\" and Eve becomes Adam's wife. Lilith then takes the form of the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] in her jealous rage at being displaced as Adam's wife. Lilith as serpent then proceeds to trick Eve into eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge and in this way is responsible for the downfall of all of mankind. It is worthwhile to note here that in religions pre-dating Judaism, the serpent was associated with wisdom and rebirth (with the shedding of its skin).\n\nThe following female deities are mentioned in prominent Hebrew texts:\n* [[Agrat Bat Mahlat]]\n* [[Anath]]\n* [[Asherah]]\n* [[Ashima]]\n* [[Astarte]]\n* [[Eisheth]]\n\n===Christianity===\n{{Main|Marian veneration|Sophia (wisdom)}}\n[[Image:Sophia design.jpg|thumb|[[Sophia (wisdom)|Virgin Sophia]] design on a [[Harmony Society]] doorway in [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]], carved by [[Frederick Reichert Rapp]] (1775\u20131834).]]\n\nIn Christianity, worship of any other deity besides the [[Trinity]] was deemed [[heresy|heretical]].

That being said, the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] is not a goddess.\n\nIn some Christian traditions (like the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition), [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] is the personification of either divine wisdom (or of an archangel) that takes female form.

[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] is identified by some as the wisdom imparting [[Holy Spirit]] of the [[Christian Trinity]], whose names in Hebrew\u2014[[Ruach]] and [[Shekhinah]]\u2014are both feminine, and whose symbol of the [[dove]] was commonly associated in the [[Ancient Near East]] with the figure of the [[Mother Goddess]].\n\nMembers of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) believe, though don't directly worship, in the existence of a [[Heavenly Mother (Mormonism)|Heavenly Mother]] who is the female counterpart of the Heavenly Father. Its adherents also believe that all humans, both men and women, have the potential to become as Gods, through a process known as [[exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]].\n\nIn [[Mysticism]], [[Gnosticism]], as well as some [[Hellenistic religion]]s, there is a female [[spirit]] or goddess named [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] who is said to embody [[wisdom]] and who is sometimes described as a [[Virginity|virgin]]. In [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[mysticism]], Saint [[Hildegard of Bingen|Hildegard]] celebrated Sophia as a cosmic figure both in her writing and art.  Within the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] tradition in [[England]], the 17th-century mystic [[Universalism|universalist]] and founder of the Philadelphian Society [[Jane Leade]] wrote copious descriptions of her visions and dialogues with the \"Virgin Sophia\" who, she said, revealed to her the spiritual workings of the universe. Leade was hugely influenced by the theosophical writings of 16th-century [[Germany|German]] Christian mystic [[Jakob B\u00f6hme]], who also speaks of Sophia in works such as ''The Way to Christ''.<ref name=\"Way\">{{cite book | title=The Way to Christ| url=http://www.passtheword.org/DIALOGS-FROM-THE-PAST/waychrst.htm| last=B\u00f6hme| first=Jacob| authorlink=Jacob B\u00f6hme|others=William Law (trans.)| date=1622 <!--(1764)-->| publisher=M. Richardson| location=Pater-noster Row, London}}</ref>  Jakob B\u00f6hme was very influential to a number of [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystics]] and religious leaders, including [[George Rapp]] and the [[Harmony Society]].\n\n==Feminism ==\n{{Main|Feminist theology}}\n[[File:Isis Musei Capitolini MC744.jpg|thumb|236px<!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)-->|Roman, [[Hadrian|Hadrianic period]], statue of [[Isis]] in marble from the [[Musei Capitolini]].]]\n\n===Goddess movement===\n{{Main|Goddess movement}}\nAt least since [[first-wave feminism]] in the United States, there has been interest in analyzing religion to see if and how doctrines and practices treat women unfairly, as in [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]'s ''[[The Woman's Bible]]''. Again in [[second-wave feminism]] in the U.S., as well as in many European and other countries, religion became the focus of some feminist analysis in Judaism, Christianity, and other religions, and some women turned to ancient goddess religions as an alternative to Abrahamic religions (''Womanspirit Rising'' 1979; ''Weaving the Visions'' 1989). Today both women and men continue to be involved in the [[Goddess movement]] (Christ 1997). The popularity of organizations such as the [[Fellowship of Isis]] attest to the continuing growth of the religion of the Goddess throughout the world.\n\nWhile much of the attempt at gender equity in mainstream Christianity (Judaism never recognized any gender for God) is aimed at reinterpreting scripture and degenderizing language used to name and describe the divine (Ruether, 1984; Plaskow, 1991), there are a growing number of people who identify as Christians or Jews who are trying to integrate goddess imagery into their religions (Kien, 2000; Kidd 1996,\"Goddess Christians Yahoo Group\").\n\n===Sacred feminine===\n{{main|Thealogy}}\nThe term \"sacred feminine\" was first coined in the 1970s, in [[New Age]] popularizations of the Hindu [[Shakti]]. Hinduism also worships multitude of goddesses that have their important role and thus in all came to interest for the New Age, feminist, and lesbian feminist movements.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kinsley|first1=David|title=Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition|date=1988|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520908833|page=1|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.bg/books?id=HzldwMHeS6IC&lpg=PP1&dq=goddess&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Metaphorical use==\nThe term \"goddess\" has also been adapted to poetic and secular use as a complimentary description of a non-mythological woman.<ref>[[OED]]: \"Applied to a woman. one's goddess: the woman whom one \u2018worships\u2019 or devotedly admires.\"{{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2016}}</ref> The [[OED]] notes 1579 as the date of the earliest attestation of such figurative use, in ''[[Laura de Noves|Lauretta]] the diuine [[Petrarch]]es Goddesse''.\n\n[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] had several of his male characters address female characters as goddesses, including Demetrius to [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (\"O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!\"), Berowne to Rosaline in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' (\"A woman I forswore; but I will prove, Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee\"), and Bertram to Diana in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]''. Pisanio also compares Imogen to a goddess to describe her composure under duress in ''[[Cymbeline]]''.\n\n==Neopaganism==\n{{Main|Goddess movement}}\nMost [[Modern Paganism|Modern Pagan]] traditions honour one or more goddesses. While some who follow [[Wicca]] believe in a [[Dualistic cosmology|duotheistic]] belief system, consisting of a single goddess and a single god, who in [[hieros gamos]] represent a united whole, others recognize only one or more goddesses.\n\n===Wicca===\n{{Further|Goddess (Wicca)|Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)}}\n[[Image:Triple-Goddess-Waxing-Full-Waning-Symbol.svg|thumb|The lunar [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] symbol.]]\n\nIn [[Wicca]] \"the Goddess\" is a deity of prime importance, along with her consort the [[Horned God]].\nWithin many forms of Wicca the Goddess has come to be considered as a universal deity, more in line with her description in the [[Charge of the Goddess]], a key Wiccan text. In this guise she is the \"Queen of Heaven\", similar to [[Isis]]. She also encompasses and conceives all life, much like [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. Similarly to Isis and certain late Classical conceptions of [[Selene]], she is the summation of all other goddesses, who represent her different names and aspects across the different cultures. The Goddess is often portrayed with strong lunar symbolism, drawing on various cultures and deities such as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Hecate]], and [[Isis]], and is often depicted as the Maiden, Mother, and Crone triad popularised by [[Robert Graves]] (see [[#Triple Goddess|Triple Goddess]] below). Many depictions of her also draw strongly on [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] goddesses. Some Wiccans believe there are many goddesses, and in some forms of Wicca, notably [[Dianic Wicca]], the Goddess alone is worshipped, and the [[Horned God|God]] plays very little part in their worship and ritual.\n\nGoddesses or demi-goddesses appear in sets of three in a number of ancient European pagan mythologies; these include the Greek ''[[Erinyes]]'' (Furies) and ''[[Moirai]]'' (Fates); the Norse ''[[Norns]]''; [[Brighid]] and her two sisters, also called Brighid, from Irish or [[Celtic mythology]].\n\n[[Robert Graves]]  popularised the triad of \"Maiden\" (or \"Virgin\"), \"Mother\" and \"Crone\", and while this idea did not rest on sound scholarship, his poetic inspiration has gained a tenacious hold. Considerable variation in the precise conceptions of these figures exists, as typically occurs in Neopaganism and indeed in pagan religions in general. Some choose to interpret them as three stages in a woman's life, separated by [[menarche]] and [[menopause]]. Others find this too biologically based and rigid, and prefer a freer interpretation, with the Maiden as birth (independent, self-centred, seeking), the Mother as giving birth (interrelated, compassionate nurturing, creating), and the Crone as death and renewal (holistic, remote, unknowable)&nbsp;\u2014 and all three erotic and wise.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Religion}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Anima (Jung)]]\n* [[Gavari]]\n* [[Gender of God]]\n* [[Gingira]]\n* [[Goddess movement]]\n* [[Heavenly Mother]]\n* [[List of goddesses]]\n* [[Matriarchy]]\n* [[Mother goddess]]\n* [[Ochre]]\n* [[Oshun]]\n* [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]\n* [[Succubus]]\n* [[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]\n* [[The White Goddess]]\n* [[Tree deity]]\n* [[Venus figurines]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dexter, Miriam Robbins, and [[Victor Mair]] (2010).
