Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. As coal contains mainly carbon, the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonization.<ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous]] Period provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.

The versatility of [[syngas]] as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using relatively inexpensive coal to produce a wide range of valuable commodities.\n\nHistorically, production of chemicals from coal has been used since the 1950s and has become established in the market. According to the 2010 Worldwide Gasification Database,<ref name=DOEGasificationDatabase2010>{{cite web|title=Gasification Systems 2010 Worldwide Gasification Database |url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/gasification/worlddatabase/ |publisher=United States Department of Energy |accessdate=3 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301123527/http://@netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/gasification/worlddatabase/ |archivedate=1 March 2013 }}</ref> a survey of current and planned gasifiers, from 2004 to 2007 chemical production increased its gasification product share from 37% to 45%. From 2008 to 2010, 22% of new gasifier additions were to be for chemical production.\n\nBecause the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa, China, India and the United States where there are abundant coal resources. The abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in China is strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry pursued there. In the United States, the best example of the industry is Eastman Chemical Company which has been successfully operating a coal-to-chemicals plant at its Kingsport, Tennessee, site since 1983. Similarly, Sasol has built and operated coal-to-chemicals facilities in South Africa.\n\nCoal to chemical processes do require substantial quantities of water.

A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire.<ref>{{cite web |title=Committee on Resources-Index |url=http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/archives/108/testimony/johnmasterson.htm |accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825231038/http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/archives/108/testimony/johnmasterson.htm |archivedate=25 August 2005 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Snapshots 2003 |work=fire.blm.gov |url=http://www.fire.blm.gov/textdocuments/6-27-03.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218013724/http://www.fire.blm.gov/textdocuments/6-27-03.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2006 |accessdate=9 September 2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, amounting to 2\u20133% of the annual worldwide production of CO<sub>2</sub> from [[fossil fuel]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=EHP 110-5, 2002: Forum |url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2002/110-5/forum.html |accessdate=9 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050731081620/http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2002/110-5/forum.html |archivedate=31 July 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Overview about ITC's activities in China |url=http://www.itc.nl/personal/coalfire/activities/overview.html |accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616004903/http://www.itc.nl/personal/coalfire/activities/overview.html |archivedate=16 June 2005 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> In [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] (a [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] located in the [[Coal Region]] of the United States), an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned [[anthracite coal|anthracite]] [[Surface mining|strip mine]] pit.

for example: qi vacuity and qi stagnation in the case of qi;<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> blood vacuity, blood stasis, and blood heat in the case of xu\u0115;<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Spleen qi vacuity, Spleen yang vacuity, Spleen qi vacuity with down-bearing qi, Spleen qi vacuity with lack of blood containment, cold-damp invasion of the Spleen, damp-heat invasion of Spleen and Stomach in case of the Spleen z\u00e0ng;<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/> wind/cold/damp invasion in the case of the meridians.<ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/>\n\nTCM gives detailed prescriptions of these patterns regarding their typical symptoms, mostly including characteristic tongue and/or pulse findings.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> For example:\n* \"Upflaming Liver fire\" (\u809d\u706b\u4e0a\u708e, {{zh|p=g\u0101nhu\u01d2 sh\u00e0ng y\u00e1n}}): Headache, red face, reddened eyes, dry mouth, nosebleeds, constipation, dry or hard stools, profuse menstruation, sudden [[tinnitus]] or deafness, vomiting of sour or bitter fluids, expectoration of blood, [[irascibility]], impatience; red tongue with dry yellow fur; slippery and string-like pulse.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n\n====Eight principles of diagnosis====\nThe process of determining which actual pattern is on hand is called \u8fa9\u8bc1 ({{zh|p=bi\u00e0n zh\u00e8ng}}, usually translated as \"pattern diagnosis\",<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/> \"pattern identification\"<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> or \"pattern discrimination\"<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>). Generally, the first and most important step in pattern diagnosis is an evaluation of the present signs and symptoms on the basis of the \"Eight Principles\" (\u516b\u7eb2, {{zh|p=b\u0101 g\u0101ng}}).<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\nThese eight principles refer to four pairs of fundamental qualities of a disease: exterior/interior, heat/cold, vacuity/repletion, and yin/yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Out of these, heat/cold and vacuity/repletion have the biggest clinical importance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> The yin/yang quality, on the other side, has the smallest importance and is somewhat seen aside from the other three pairs, since it merely presents a general and vague conclusion regarding what other qualities are found.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In detail, the Eight Principles refer to the following:\n* ''Yin and yang'' are universal aspects all things can be classified under, this includes diseases in general as well as the Eight Principles' first three couples.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> For example, cold is identified to be a yin aspect, while heat is attributed to yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Since descriptions of patterns in terms of yin and yang lack complexity and clinical practicality, though, patterns are usually not labelled this way anymore.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Exceptions are vacuity-cold and repletion-heat patterns, who are sometimes referred to as \"yin patterns\" and \"yang patterns\" respectively.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Exterior'' (\u8868, {{zh|p=bi\u01ceo}}) refers to a disease manifesting in the superficial layers of the body \u2013 skin, hair, flesh, and meridians.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> It is characterized by aversion to cold and/or wind, headache, muscle ache, mild fever, a \"floating\" pulse, and a normal tongue appearance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Interior'' (\u91cc, {{zh|p=l\u01d0}}) refers to disease manifestation in the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, or (in a wider sense) to any disease that can not be counted as exterior.<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> There are no generalized characteristic symptoms of interior patterns, since they'll be determined by the affected z\u00e0ng or f\u01d4 entity.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Cold'' (\u5bd2, {{zh|p=h\u00e1n}}) is generally characterized by aversion to cold, absence of thirst, and a white tongue fur.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> More detailed characterization depends on whether cold is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Heat'' (\u70ed, {{zh|p=r\u00e8}}) is characterized by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Deficiency'' (\u865a, {{zh|p=x\u016b}}), can be further differentiated into deficiency of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Qi|qi]], xu\u011b, [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|yin and yang]], with all their respective characteristic symptoms.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Yin deficiency can also cause \"empty-heat\".<ref name=\"Kaptchuck 2000\"/>\n* ''Excess'' (\u5b9e, {{zh|p=sh\u00ed}}) generally refers to any disease that can't be identified as a deficient pattern, and usually indicates the presence of one of the Six Excesses,<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> or a pattern of stagnation (of qi, xu\u011b, etc.).<ref>Tierra & Tierra 1998, p. 108</ref> In a concurrent exterior pattern, excess is characterized by the absence of sweating.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n\nAfter the fundamental nature of a disease in terms of the Eight Principles is determined, the investigation focuses on more specific aspects.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> By evaluating the present signs and symptoms against the background of typical disharmony patterns of the various entities, evidence is collected whether or how specific entities are affected.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> This evaluation can be done\n# in respect of the meridians (\u7ecf\u7edc\u8fa9\u8bc1,

Certain sectors of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the z\u00e0ng-f\u016d. For example, teeth marks on one part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the Heart, while teeth marks on another part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the Liver.\n\nPulse palpation involves measuring the pulse both at a superficial and at a deep level at three different locations on the [[radial artery]] (''Cun, Guan, Chi'', located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain z\u00e0ng-f\u016d.  The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength and volume, and described with qualities like \"floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick\"; each of these qualities indicate certain [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Patterns|disease patterns]].

The bond may result from the [[electrostatic force]] of attraction between oppositely charged ions as in ionic bonds or through the sharing of electrons as in [[covalent bond]]s. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are \"strong bonds\" or \"primary bonds\" such as covalent, [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[Metallic bonding|metallic]] bonds, and \"weak bonds\" or \"secondary bonds\" such as [[dipole\u2013dipole interaction]]s, the [[London dispersion force]] and [[hydrogen bond]]ing.\n\nSince opposite charges attract via a simple [[electromagnetic force]], the negatively charged [[electron]]s that are orbiting the nucleus and the positively charged [[proton]]s in the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] attract each other. An electron positioned between two nuclei will be attracted to both of them, and the nuclei will be attracted toward electrons in this position. This attraction constitutes the chemical bond. Due to the [[matter wave]] nature of electrons and their smaller mass, they must occupy a much larger amount of volume compared with the nuclei, and this volume occupied by the electrons keeps the atomic nuclei in a bond relatively far apart, as compared with the size of the nuclei themselves.\n\nIn general, strong chemical bonding is associated with the sharing or transfer of electrons between the participating atoms. The atoms in [[molecule]]s, [[crystal]]s, [[metal]]s and diatomic gases\u2014indeed most of the physical environment around us\u2014are held together by chemical bonds, which dictate the structure and the bulk properties of matter.\n[[File:electron dot.svg|300px|thumb|right|Examples of [[Lewis dot]]-style representations of chemical bonds between [[carbon]] (C), [[hydrogen]] (H), and [[oxygen]] (O). Lewis dot diagrams were an early attempt to describe chemical bonding and are still widely used today.]]\n\nAll bonds can be explained by [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], but, in practice, simplification rules allow chemists to predict the strength, directionality, and polarity of bonds. The [[octet rule]] and [[VSEPR theory]] are two examples. More sophisticated theories are [[valence bond theory]] which includes [[orbital hybridization]] and [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]], and [[molecular orbital theory]] which includes [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] and [[ligand field theory]]. [[Electrostatics]] are used to describe bond polarities and the effects they have on chemical substances.\n\n== Overview of main types of chemical bonds == \nA chemical bond is an attraction between atoms. This attraction may be seen as the result of different behaviors of the outermost or [[valence electron]]s of atoms. These behaviors merge into each other seamlessly in various circumstances, so that there is no clear line to be drawn between them. However it remains useful and customary to differentiate between different types of bond, which result in different properties of [[condensed matter]].\n\nIn the simplest view of a [[covalent bond]], one or more electrons (often a pair of electrons) are drawn into the space between the two atomic nuclei. Energy is released by bond formation. This is not as a reduction in potential energy, because the attraction of the two electrons to the two protons is offset by the electron-electron and proton-proton repulsions. Instead, the release of energy (and hence stability of the bond) arises from the reduction in kinetic energy due to the electrons being in a more spatially distributed (i.e. longer [[de Broglie wavelength]]) orbital compared with each electron being confined closer to its respective nucleus.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00897010509a|author=Rioux, F. |title=The Covalent Bond in H<sub>2</sub> |journal=The Chemical Educator |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=288 |year=2001 }}</ref> These bonds exist between two particular identifiable atoms and have a direction in space, allowing them to be shown as single connecting lines between atoms in drawings, or modeled as sticks between spheres in models.\n\nIn a [[polar covalent bond]], one or more electrons are unequally shared between two nuclei. Covalent bonds often result in the formation of small collections of better-connected atoms called [[molecule]]s, which in solids and liquids are bound to other molecules by forces that are often much weaker than the covalent bonds that hold the molecules internally together. Such weak intermolecular bonds give organic molecular substances, such as waxes and oils, their soft bulk character, and their low melting points (in liquids, molecules must cease most structured or oriented contact  \nwith each other). When covalent bonds link long chains of atoms in large molecules, however (as in polymers such as [[nylon]]), or when covalent bonds extend in networks through solids that are not composed of discrete molecules (such as [[diamond]] or [[quartz]] or the [[silicate minerals]] in many types of rock) then the structures that result may be both strong and tough, at least in the direction oriented correctly with networks of covalent bonds. Also, the melting points of such covalent polymers and networks increase greatly.\n\nIn a simplified view of an [[ionic bond|''ionic'' bond]], the bonding electron is not shared at all, but transferred. In this type of bond, the outer [[atomic orbital]] of one atom has a vacancy which allows the addition of one or more electrons. These newly added electrons potentially occupy a lower energy-state (effectively closer to more nuclear charge) than they experience in a different atom. Thus, one nucleus offers a more tightly bound position to an electron than does another nucleus, with the result that one atom may transfer an electron to the other. This transfer causes one atom to assume a net positive charge, and the other to assume a net negative charge. The ''bond'' then results from electrostatic attraction between atoms and the atoms become positive or negatively charged [[ion]]s. Ionic bonds may be seen as extreme examples of polarization in covalent bonds. Often, such bonds have no particular orientation in space, since they result from equal electrostatic attraction of each ion to all ions around them. Ionic bonds are strong (and thus ionic substances require high temperatures to melt) but also brittle, since the forces between ions are short-range and do not easily bridge cracks and fractures. This type of bond gives rise to the physical characteristics of crystals of classic mineral salts, such as table salt.\n\nA less often mentioned type of bonding is [[metallic bond|''metallic'' bond]]ing. In this type of bonding, each atom in a metal donates one or more electrons to a \"sea\" of electrons that reside between many metal atoms. In this sea, each electron is free (by virtue of its [[wave nature]]) to be associated with a great many atoms at once. The bond results because the metal atoms become somewhat positively charged due to loss of their electrons while the electrons remain attracted to many atoms, without being part of any given atom. Metallic bonding may be seen as an extreme example of [[delocalization]] of electrons over a large system of covalent bonds, in which every atom participates. This type of bonding is often very strong (resulting in the [[tensile strength]] of metals). However, metallic bonding is more collective in nature than other types, and so they allow metal crystals to more easily deform, because they are composed of atoms attracted to each other, but not in any particularly-oriented ways. This results in the malleability of metals. The cloud of electrons in metallic bonding causes the characteristically good electrical and thermal conductivity of metals, and also their shiny [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] that reflects most frequencies of white light.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|History of chemistry|History of the molecule}}\nEarly speculations about the nature of the '''chemical bond''', from as early as the 12th century, supposed that certain types of [[chemical species]] were joined by a type of [[chemical affinity]]. In 1704, [[Sir Isaac Newton]] famously outlined his atomic bonding theory, in \"Query 31\" of his ''[[Opticks]]'', whereby [[atom]]s attach to each other by some \"[[force]]\". Specifically, after acknowledging the various popular theories in vogue at the time, of how atoms were reasoned to attach to each other, i.e. \"hooked atoms\", \"glued together by rest\", or \"stuck together by conspiring motions\", Newton states that he would rather infer from their cohesion, that \"particles attract one another by some [[force]], which in immediate contact is exceedingly strong, at small distances performs the chemical operations, and reaches not far from the particles with any sensible effect.\"\n\nIn 1819, on the heels of the invention of the [[voltaic pile]], [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] developed a theory of chemical combination stressing the electronegative and electropositive characters of the combining atoms. By the mid 19th century, [[Edward Frankland]], [[August Kekul\u00e9|F.A. Kekul\u00e9]], A.S. Couper, [[Alexander Butlerov]], and [[Hermann Kolbe]], building on the [[Radical (chemistry)|theory of radicals]], developed the [[Valence (chemistry)|theory of valency]], originally called \"combining power\", in which compounds were joined owing to an attraction of positive and negative poles. In 1916, chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] developed the concept of the [[Covalent bond|electron-pair bond]], in which two atoms may share one to six electrons, thus forming the [[single electron bond]], a [[single bond]], a [[double bond]], or a [[triple bond]]; in Lewis's own words, \"An electron may form a part of the shell of two different atoms and cannot be said to belong to either one exclusively.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Gilbert N.|authorlink=Gilbert N. Lewis|year=1916|title=The Atom and the Molecule|journal=[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] |volume=38|page=772|url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/bond/papers/corr216.3-lewispub-19160400.html|doi=10.1021/ja02261a002|issue=4}} [http://www.itis.arezzo.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=221%3Athe-atom-and-the-molecule-&catid=106%3Apagine-html&Itemid=98 a copy]</ref>\n\nThat same year, [[Walther Kossel]] put forward a theory similar to Lewis' only his model assumed complete transfers of electrons between atoms, and was thus a model of [[ionic bond]]ing. Both Lewis and Kossel structured their bonding models on that of [[Abegg's rule]] (1904).\n\n[[Niels Bohr]] proposed [[Bohr model|a model of the atom]] and [[Bohr model of the chemical bond|\na model of the chemical bond]]. According to his model for a [[diatomic molecule]], the electrons of the atoms of the molecule form a rotating ring whose plane is perpendicular to the axis of the molecule and equidistant from the atomic nuclei. The [[dynamic equilibrium]] of the molecular system is achieved through the balance of forces between the forces of attraction of nuclei to the plane of the ring of electrons and the forces of mutual repulsion of the nuclei. The Bohr model of the chemical bond took into account the [[Coulomb repulsion]] - the electrons in the ring are at the maximum distance from each other.<ref>{{cite book| author = \u0411\u043e\u0440 \u041d.| title = \u0418\u0437\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u044b (\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0438 1909-1925) |location= \u041c. |year= 1970 |publisher= \u00ab\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430\u00bb |volume= 1 | page = 133 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Svidzinsky|first=Anatoly A. |author2 = Marlan O.

J. |year=1993|title=The World of Physical Chemistry|publisher=Oxford University Press | page=346|isbn=0-19-855919-4}}</ref> This work showed that the quantum approach to chemical bonds could be fundamentally and quantitatively correct, but the mathematical methods used could not be extended to molecules containing more than one electron. A more practical, albeit less quantitative, approach was put forward in the same year by [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]]. The Heitler\u2013London method forms the basis of what is now called [[valence bond theory]]. In 1929, the [[linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method]] (LCAO) approximation was introduced by Sir [[John Lennard-Jones]], who also suggested methods to derive electronic structures of molecules of F<sub>2</sub> ([[fluorine]]) and O<sub>2</sub> ([[oxygen]]) molecules, from basic quantum principles. This [[molecular orbital]] theory represented a covalent bond as an orbital formed by combining the quantum mechanical [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|Schr\u00f6dinger]] atomic orbitals which had been hypothesized for electrons in single atoms. The equations for bonding electrons in multi-electron atoms could not be solved to mathematical perfection (i.e., ''analytically''), but approximations for them still gave many good qualitative predictions and results. Most quantitative calculations in modern [[quantum chemistry]] use either valence bond or molecular orbital theory as a starting point, although a third approach, [[density functional theory]], has become increasingly popular in recent years.\n\nIn 1933, H. H. James and A. S. Coolidge carried out a calculation on the dihydrogen molecule that, unlike all previous calculation which used functions only of the distance of the electron from the atomic nucleus, used functions which also explicitly added the distance between the two electrons.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last = James\n| first = H.

Later extensions have used up to 54 parameters and gave excellent agreement with experiments. This calculation convinced the scientific community that quantum theory could give agreement with experiment. However this approach has none of the physical pictures of the valence bond and molecular orbital theories and is difficult to extend to larger molecules.\n\n== Bonds in chemical formulas ==\nBecause atoms and molecules are three-dimensional, it is difficult to use a single method to indicate orbitals and bonds. In '''[[molecular formula]]s''' the chemical bonds (binding orbitals) between atoms are indicated in different ways depending on the type of discussion. Sometimes, some details are neglected. For example, in [[organic chemistry]] one is sometimes concerned only with the [[functional group]] of the molecule. Thus, the molecular formula of [[ethanol]] may be written in [[conformational isomerism|conformational]] form, three-dimensional form, full two-dimensional form (indicating every bond with no three-dimensional directions), compressed two-dimensional form (CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013OH), by separating the functional group from another part of the molecule (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH), or by its atomic constituents (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O), according to what is discussed. Sometimes, even the non-bonding valence shell electrons (with the two-dimensional approximate directions) are marked, e.g. for elemental carbon <sub>.</sub><sup>'</sup>C<sup>'</sup>. Some chemists may also mark the respective orbitals, e.g. the hypothetical ethene<sup>\u22124</sup> anion (<sub>\\</sub><sup>/</sup>C=C<sub>/</sub><sup>\\</sup> <sup>\u22124</sup>) indicating the possibility of bond formation.\n\n== Strong chemical bonds ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''Typical [[bond length]]s in pm<br />and bond [[energy|energies]] in kJ/mol.'''<br /><small>Bond lengths can be converted to [[\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m|\u00c5]]<br />by division by 100 (1 \u00c5 = 100 pm).<br />Data taken from University of Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/c120/bondel.html |title=Bond Lengths and Energies |publisher=Science.uwaterloo.ca |accessdate=2013-10-15}}</ref> </small>\n|-\n!

A strong chemical bond is formed from the transfer or sharing of [[electron]]s between atomic centers and relies on the [[electrostatic attraction]] between the protons in nuclei and the electrons in the orbitals.\n\nThe types of strong bond differ due to the difference in [[electronegativity]] of the constituent elements. A large difference in electronegativity leads to more polar (ionic) character in the bond.\n\n=== Ionic bond ===\n{{Main article|Ionic bonding}}\nIonic bonding is a type of electrostatic interaction between atoms which have a large electronegativity difference. There is no precise value that distinguishes ionic from covalent bonding, but a difference of electronegativity of over 1.7 is likely to be ionic, and a difference of less than 1.7 is likely to be covalent.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Atkins\n | first = Peter\n | authorlink = Peter Atkins\n |author2=Loretta Jones\n | title = Chemistry: Molecules, Matter and Change\n | publisher = W. H. Freeman & Co.\n | year = 1997\n | location = New York\n | pages = 294\u2013295\n | isbn = 0-7167-3107-X }}</ref> Ionic bonding leads to separate positive and negative [[ions]]. Ionic charges are commonly between \u22123[[elementary charge|e]] to +3[[elementary charge|e]].\nIonic bonding commonly occurs in [[Salt (chemistry)|metal salts]] such as [[sodium chloride]] (table salt). A typical feature of ionic bonds is that the species form into ionic crystals, in which no ion is specifically paired with any single other ion, in a specific directional bond. Rather, each species of ion is surrounded by ions of the opposite charge, and the spacing between it and each of the oppositely charged ions near it, is the same for all surrounding atoms of the same type. It is thus no longer possible to associate an ion with any specific other single ionized atom near it. This is a situation unlike that in covalent crystals, where covalent bonds between specific atoms are still discernible from the shorter distances between them, as measured via such techniques as [[X-ray diffraction]].\n\nIonic crystals may contain a mixture of covalent and ionic species, as for example salts of complex acids, such as sodium cyanide, NaCN. X-ray diffraction shows that in NaCN, for example, the bonds between sodium [[cation]]s (Na<sup>+</sup>) and the cyanide [[anion]]s (CN<sup>\u2212</sup>) are ''ionic'', with no sodium ion associated with any particular cyanide. However, the bonds between C and N atoms in cyanide are of the ''covalent'' type, so that each carbon is strongly bound to ''just one'' nitrogen, to which it is physically much closer than it is to other carbons or nitrogens in a sodium cyanide crystal.\n\nWhen such crystals are melted into liquids, the ionic bonds are broken first because they are non-directional and allow the charged species to move freely. Similarly, when such salts dissolve into water, the ionic bonds are typically broken by the interaction with water, but the covalent bonds continue to hold. For example, in solution, the cyanide ions, still bound together as single CN<sup>\u2212</sup> ions, move independently through the solution, as do sodium ions, as Na<sup>+</sup>. In water, charged ions move apart because each of them are more strongly attracted to a number of water molecules, than to each other. The attraction between ions and water molecules in such solutions is due to a type of weak [[intermolecular force|dipole-dipole]] type chemical bond. In melted ionic compounds, the ions continue to be attracted to each other, but not in any ordered or crystalline way.\n\n=== Covalent bond ===\n{{Main article|Covalent bond}}\n[[File:covalent.svg|thumb|160px|Nonpolar covalent bonds in [[methane]] (CH<sub>4</sub>). The [[Lewis structure]] shows electrons shared between C and H atoms.]]\nCovalent bonding is a common type of bonding, in which two or more atoms share [[valence electrons]] more or less equally. The simplest and most common type is a [[single bond]] in which two atoms share two electrons. Other types include the [[double bond]], the [[triple bond]], [[Covalent bond#One- and three-electron bonds|one- and three-electron bonds]], the [[three-center two-electron bond]] and [[three-center four-electron bond]].\n\nIn nonpolar covalent bonds, the electronegativity difference between the bonded atoms is small, typically 0 to 0.3. Bonds within most [[organic compound]]s are described as covalent. The figure shows methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), in which each hydrogen forms a covalent bond with the carbon. See [[sigma bond]]s and [[pi bond]]s for LCAO-description of such bonding.\n\nMolecules which are formed primarily from non-polar covalent bonds are often [[Miscibility|immiscible]] in water or other [[polar solvent]]s, but much more soluble in [[non-polar solvent]]s such as [[hexane]].\n\nA [[polar covalent bond]] is a covalent bond with a significant [[ionic bonding|ionic character]]. This means that the two shared electrons are closer to one of the atoms than the other, creating an imbalance of charge. Such bonds occur between two atoms with moderately different electronegativities and give rise to [[Dipole#Molecular dipoles|dipole\u2013dipole interactions]]. The electronegativity difference between the two atoms in these bonds is 0.3 to 1.7.\n\n==== Single and multiple bonds ====\nA [[single bond]] between two atoms corresponds to the sharing of one pair of electrons. The electron density of these two bonding electrons is concentrated in the region between the two atoms, which is the defining quality of a [[sigma bond]].\n\n[[File:Pi-Bond.svg|thumb|right|Two p-orbitals forming a pi-bond.]]\nA [[double bond]] between two atoms is formed by the sharing of two pairs of electrons, one in a sigma bond and one in a [[pi bond]], with electron density concentrated on two opposite sides of the internuclear axis. A [[triple bond]] consists of three shared electron pairs, forming one sigma and two pi bonds.\n\n[[Quadruple bond|Quadruple]] and higher bonds are very rare and occur only between certain [[transition metal]] atoms.\n\n===Coordinate covalent bond (Dipolar bond)===\n[[File:NH3-BF3-adduct-bond-lengthening-2D.png|thumb|[[Adduct]] of ammonia and boron trifluoride]]\nA [[coordinate covalent bond]] is a covalent bond in which the two shared \nbonding electrons are from the same one of the atoms involved in the bond. \nFor example, [[boron trifluoride]] (BF<sub>3</sub>) and [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>) from an [[adduct]] or [[coordination complex]] F<sub>3</sub>B\u2190NH<sub>3</sub> with a B\u2013N bond in which a [[lone pair]] of electrons on N is shared with an empty atomic orbital on B. BF<sub>3</sub> with an empty orbital is described as an electron pair acceptor or [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acid]], while NH<sub>3</sub> with a lone pair which can be shared is described as an electron-pair donor or [[Lewis base]]. The electrons are shared roughly equally between the atoms in contrast to ionic bonding. Such bonding is shown by an arrow pointing to the Lewis acid.\n\n[[Transition metal complex]]es are generally bound by coordinate covalent bonds. For example, the ion Ag<sup>+</sup> reacts as a Lewis acid with two molecules of the Lewis base NH<sub>3</sub> to form the complex ion Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, which has two Ag\u2190N coordinate covalent bonds.\n\n=== Metallic bonding ===\n{{Main article|Metallic bonding}}\nIn metallic bonding, bonding electrons are delocalized over a lattice of atoms. By contrast, in ionic compounds, the locations of the binding electrons and their charges are static. The freely-moving or delocalization of bonding electrons leads to classical metallic properties such as [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] (surface light [[reflectivity]]), [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]], [[ductility]], and high [[tensile strength]].\n\n== Intermolecular bonding ==\n{{Main article|Intermolecular force}}\nThere are four basic types of bonds that can be formed between two or more (otherwise non-associated) molecules, ions or atoms. [[Intermolecular force]]s cause molecules to be attracted or repulsed by each other. Often, these define some of the physical characteristics (such as the [[melting point]]) of a substance.\n\n* A large difference in [[electronegativity]] between two bonded atoms will cause a permanent charge separation, or dipole, in a molecule or ion. Two or more molecules or ions with permanent dipoles can interact within [[Intermolecular Force#Dipole-dipole interactions|dipole-dipole interactions]]. The bonding electrons in a molecule or ion will, on average, be closer to the more electronegative atom more frequently than the less electronegative one, giving rise to [[partial charge]]s on each atom, and causing [[electrostatic force]]s between molecules or ions.\n* A [[hydrogen bond]] is effectively a strong example of an interaction between two permanent dipoles. The large difference in electronegativities between [[hydrogen]] and any of [[fluorine]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], coupled with their lone pairs of electrons cause strong electrostatic forces between molecules. Hydrogen bonds are responsible for the high boiling points of water and [[ammonia]] with respect to their heavier analogues.\n* The [[London dispersion force]] arises due to instantaneous dipoles in neighbouring atoms. As the negative charge of the [[electron]] is not uniform around the whole atom, there is always a charge imbalance. This small charge will induce a corresponding dipole in a nearby molecule; causing an attraction between the two. The electron then moves to another part of the [[electron cloud]] and the attraction is broken.\n* A [[cation\u2013pi interaction]] occurs between a [[pi bond]] and a cation.\n\n== Theories of chemical bonding ==\n{{main article|Chemical bonding model}}\nIn the (unrealistic) limit of \"pure\" [[ionic bond]]ing, electrons are perfectly localized on one of the two atoms in the bond. Such bonds can be understood by [[classical physics]]. The forces between the atoms are characterized by [[isotropic]] continuum electrostatic potentials. Their magnitude is in simple proportion to the charge difference.\n\nCovalent bonds are better understood by [[valence bond theory]] or [[molecular orbital theory]]. The properties of the atoms involved can be understood using concepts such as [[oxidation number]]. The electron density within a bond is not assigned to individual atoms, but is instead delocalized between atoms. In valence bond theory, the two electrons on the two atoms are coupled together with the bond strength depending on the overlap between them. In molecular orbital theory, the [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method|linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO) helps describe the delocalized molecular orbital structures and energies based on the atomic orbitals of the atoms they came from. Unlike pure ionic bonds, covalent bonds may have directed [[anisotropic]] properties. These may have their own names, such as [[sigma bond]] and [[pi bond]].\n\nIn the general case, atoms form bonds that are intermediate between ionic and covalent, depending on the relative [[electronegativity]] of the atoms involved. This type of bond is sometimes called [[polar covalent bond|polar covalent]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Commonscat|Chemical bonding}}\n* W.

[[Shirazi people|Shirazi]] immigrants appear to have arrived some time after the tenth century A.D.\n\nIn the 16th century, social changes on the East African coast probably linked to the arrival of the Portuguese saw the arrival of a number of Arabs of Hadrami who established alliances with the [[Shirazi (ethnic group)|Shirazis]] and founded several royal clans.\n\nOver the centuries, the [[Comoro Islands]] have been settled by a succession of diverse groups from the coast of Africa, the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Madagascar]]. Portuguese explorers first visited the archipelago in 1505.\n\nApart from a visit by the French [[Jean Parmentier (explorer)|Parmentier]] brothers in 1529, for much of the 16th century the only Europeans to visit the islands were Portuguese; British and Dutch ships began arriving around the start of the 17th century and the island of [[Ndzwani]] soon became a major supply point on the route to the East. Ndzwani was generally ruled by a single sultan, who occasionally attempted to extend his authority to [[Mayotte]] and [[Mwali]]; [[Ngazidja]] was more fragmented, on occasion being divided into as many as 12 small kingdoms.\n\nBoth the British and the French turned their attention to the Comoros islands in the middle of the 19th century. The French finally acquired the islands through a cunning mixture of strategies, including the policy of \"divide and conquer\", chequebook politics and a serendipitous affair between a sultana and a French trader that was put to good use by the French, who kept control of the islands, quelling unrest and the occasional uprising.\n\nWilliam Sunley, a planter and British Consul from 1848\u20131866, was an influence on Anjouan.\n\n==Colonial rule==\n{{For|the history of the native sultanates on several of the major islands|List of sultans on the Comoros}}\n[[Image:Franz Sikora 038.jpg|thumb|Sultan [[Said Ali bin Said Omar of Grande Comore]] (1897)]]\n[[File:Independence Parade.jpg|thumb|Independence parade in [[Mutsamudu]] on July 6, 2015.]]\n\nOn 25 March 1841, France purchased the island of Maore&nbsp;\u2014 the name of the island was corrupted in French to \"[[Mayotte]]\"&nbsp;\u2014  which became a colony upon ratification on 13 June 1843.\n\nIn 1850 Sultan Selim of [[Ndzwani|Johanna island]] seized the American [[whaler]] ''Maria'' and imprisoned her commander, Captain Moores. In response, the United States Navy launched the [[Johanna Expedition]] in February 1852 to gain the release of Moores and extract compensation. Initially, the sultan did not meet the demands, and the [[sloop-of-war]] [[USS Dale (1839)|USS ''Dale'']] bombarded the island's fortifications; ultimately Selim paid US$1,000 and released Captain Moores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1852/02/04/archives/the-bombardment-of-johanna.html|title=The Bombardment of Johanna.|date=4 February 1852|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/special%20highlights/pirates/Suppression%20of%20Piracy%20on%20Johanna%20Island,%20August%201851,%20Amerman,%20USMC%20HD.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005840/http://www.history.navy.mil/special%20highlights/pirates/Suppression%20of%20Piracy%20on%20Johanna%20Island%2C%20August%201851%2C%20Amerman%2C%20USMC%20HD.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 1886 Said Ali bin Said Omar, [[Sultanate of Bambao|Sultan of Bambao]], signed an agreement with the French government that allowed France to establish a protectorate over the entire island of [[Ngazidja]] ([[Grande Comore]]); protectorates were also established over Ndzwani (Anjouan), and [[Mwali]] ([[Moh\u00e9li]] island in French) the same year. [[Resident (title)|R\u00e9sident]]s were posted on the three islands.\n\nOn 9 April 1908, France declared the protectorates and Mayotte a single colony, Mayotte and dependencies.\n\nOn 25 July 1912, it was annexed to [[Madagascar]] as a province of that colony.\n\nFrom 16 June 1940 to 1942 the colonial administration remained loyal to [[Vichy France]] (from 1942, under Free French), but 25 September 1942 to 13 October 1946 they were, like Madagascar, under British occupation.\n\nUntil the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], the islands used to be an important refuelling and provisioning station for ships from Europe to the Indian Ocean.\n\nIndependence came gradually for the Comoros. During the middle of the 20th century the French reluctantly began to accede to requests for constitutional changes and in 1946 the Comoros had become a separately administered colony from Madagascar.\n\nAfter World War II, the islands became a [[Overseas France|French overseas territory]] and were represented in France's [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]. Internal political autonomy was granted in 1961. Agreement was reached with France in 1973 for the Comoros to become independent in 1978. On July 6, 1975, however, the Comorian parliament passed a resolution declaring unilateral independence. The deputies of [[Mayotte]] abstained.\n\nIn two [[referendum]]s, in December 1974 and February 1976, the population of Mayotte voted against independence from France (by 63.8% and 99.4% respectively). Mayotte thus remains under French administration, and the Comorian Government has effective control over only Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Moh\u00e9li.\n\nIn 1961 the Comoros was granted autonomous rule and, seven years after the general unrest and left-wing riots of 1968, it broke all ties with France and established itself as an independent republic. From the very beginning Mayotte refused to join the new republic and aligned itself even more firmly to the French Republic, but the other islands remained committed to independence. The first president of the Comoros, [[Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane]], did not last long before being ousted in a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by [[Ali Soilih]], an [[Atheism|atheist]] with an Islamic background.\n\nSoilih began with a set of solid [[Socialism|socialist]] ideals designed to modernize the country. However, the regime faced problems. A French mercenary by the name of [[Bob Denard]], arrived in the Comoros at dawn on 13 May 1978, and removed Soilih from power. Solih was shot and killed during the coup. Abdallah returned to govern the country and the mercenaries were given key positions in government.\n\nLater, French settlers, French-owned companies, and Arab merchants established a plantation-based economy that now uses about one-third of the land for export crops.\n\n==Abdallah regime==\n{{main|History of the Comoros (1978\u201389)}}\nIn 1978, president [[Ali Soilih]], who had a firm anti-French line, was killed and [[Ahmed Abdallah]] came to power. Under the reign of Abdallah, Denard was commander of the Presidential Guard (PG) and ''de facto'' ruler of the country. He was trained, supported and funded by the white regimes in South Africa (SA) and [[Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe) in return for permission to set up a secret listening post on the islands. South-African agents kept an ear on the important [[African National Congress|ANC]] bases in [[Lusaka]] and [[Dar es Salaam]] and watched the war in [[Mozambique]], in which SA played an active role. The Comoros were also used for the evasion of arms sanctions.\n\nWhen in 1981 [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] was elected president Denard lost the support of the French intelligence service, but he managed to strengthen the link between SA and the Comoros. Besides the military, Denard established his own company SOGECOM, for both the security and construction, and seemed to profit by the arrangement. Between 1985 and 1987 the relationship of the PG with the local Comorians became worse.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s the South Africans did not wish to continue to support the mercenary regime and France was in agreement. Also President Abdallah wanted the mercenaries to leave. Their response was a (third) coup resulting in the death of President Abdallah, in which Denard and his men were probably involved. South Africa and the French government subsequently forced Denard and his mercenaries to leave the islands in 1989.\n\n==1989-1996==\n[[Said Mohamed Djohar]] became president. His time in office was turbulent, including an impeachment attempt in 1991 and a coup attempt in 1992.\n\nOn September 28, 1995 [[Bob Denard]] and a group of mercenaries took over the Comoros islands in a coup (named operation Kaskari by the mercenaries) against President Djohar. France immediately severely denounced the coup, and backed by the 1978 defense agreement with the Comoros, President [[Jacques Chirac]] ordered his special forces to retake the island. Bob Denard began to take measures to stop the coming invasion. A new presidential guard was created. Strong points armed with heavy machine guns were set up around the island, particularly around the island's two airports.\n\nOn October 3, 1995, 11 p.m., the French deployed 600 men against a force of 33 mercenaries and a 300-man dissident force. Denard however ordered his mercenaries not to fight. Within 7 hours the airports at Iconi and Hahaya and the French Embassy in Moroni were secured. By 3:00&nbsp;p.m. the next day Bob Denard and his mercenaries had surrendered. [[Operation Azalee|This (response) operation, codenamed ''Azal\u00e9e'']], was remarkable, because there were no casualties, and just in seven days, plans were drawn up and soldiers were deployed. Denard was taken to France and jailed. Prime minister [[Caambi El-Yachourtu]] became acting president until Djohar returned from exile in January, 1996. In March 1996, following presidential elections, [[Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim]], a member of the civilian government that Denard had tried to set up in October 1995, became president. On 23 November 1996, [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961]] crashed near a beach on the island after it was hijacked and ran out of fuel killing 125 people and leaving 50 survivors.\n\n==Secession of Anjouan and Moh\u00e9li==\nIn 1997, the islands of [[Anjouan]] and [[Moh\u00e9li]] declared their independence from the Comoros. A subsequent attempt by the government to re-establish control over the rebellious islands by force failed, and presently the [[African Union]] is brokering negotiations to effect a reconciliation. This process is largely complete, at least in theory. According to some sources, Moh\u00e9li did return to government control in 1998. In 1999, Anjouan had internal conflicts and on August 1 of that year, the 80-year-old first president [[Foundi Abdallah Ibrahim]] resigned, transferring power to a national coordinator, [[Said Abeid]]. The government was overthrown in a coup by army and navy officers on August 9, 2001. [[Mohamed Bacar]] soon rose to leadership of the [[Military dictatorship|junta]] that took over and by the end of the month he was the leader of the country. Despite two coup attempts in the following three months, including one by Abeid, Bacar's government remained in power, and was apparently more willing to negotiate with the Comoros. Presidential elections were held for all of the Comoros in 2002, and presidents have been chosen for all three islands as well, which have become a confederation. Most notably, Mohammed Bacar was elected for a 5-year term as president of Anjouan. Grande Comore had experienced troubles of its own in the late 1990s, when President Taki died on November 6, 1998. Colonel [[Azali Assoumani]] became president following a military coup in 1999. There have been several coup attempts since, but he gained firm control of the country after stepping down temporarily and winning a presidential election in 2002.\n\nIn May 2006, [[Ahmed Abdallah Sambi]] was elected from the island of [[Anjouan]] to be the president of the [[Union of the Comoros]]. He is a well-respected [[Sunni]] cleric who studied in the [[Sudan]], [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. He is respectfully called \"[[Ayatollah]]\" by his supporters but is considered, and is, a moderate [[Islamist]]. He has been quoted as stating that the Comoros is not ready to become an Islamic state, nor shall the [[hijab|veil]] be forced upon any women in the Comoros.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200605151054.html|title=Comoros: Presidential Favourite Clear - By a Landslide|date=15 May 2006|publisher=|via=AllAfrica}}</ref>\n\n==2007-2008 Anjouan crisis==\n{{main|2008 invasion of Anjouan}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of heads of state of the Comoros]]\n*[[List of heads of government of the Comoros]]\n*[[History of Africa]]\n*[[History of Southern Africa]]\n*[[Politics of the Comoros]]\n\n==References==\n<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------\n  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for a\n  discussion of different citation methods and how to generate\n  footnotes using the <ref>, </ref> and <reference /> tags\n----------------------------------------------------------- -->\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2006}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.specwarnet.com/miscinfo/azalee.htm More on the 1995 Azalee Operation]\n* [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Comoros.html WorldStatesmen- Comoros, with relevant links]\n* {{wikiatlas|Comoros}}\n{{Comoros topics}}\n{{French overseas empire}}\n{{History of Africa}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Comoros}}\n[[Category:History of the Comoros| ]]", "sha1": "9jpv0dp5z87tsq5e0w29kctdm2jcgv3"}}, {"title": "Geography of the Comoros", "ns": "0", "id": "6001", "revision": {"id": "812517743", "parentid": "812367723", "timestamp": "2017-11-28T07:51:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "Gilliam", "id": "506179"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/144.121.83.58|144.121.83.58]] ([[User talk:144.121.83.58|talk]]) to last version by ClueBot NG", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2012}}\n[[Image:Cn-map.png|thumb|250px|Map of all islands]]\n[[File:LocationComoros.svg|thumb|250px|Location of Comoros (in circle)]]\n[[Image:Comoros in relation to Afrika map.jpg|thumb|Map of Comoros and Southern Africa]]\n[[Image:Anjouan (Comoros) map.jpg|thumb|Map of Anjouan]]\n[[Image:Moheli (Comoros) map.jpg|thumb|Map of Moheli]]\n\nThe '''[[Comoros archipelago]]''' consists of four main islands aligned along a northwest-southeast axis at the north end of the [[Mozambique Channel]], between [[Mozambique]] and the island of [[Madagascar]]. Still widely known by their French names, the islands officially have been called by their [[Swahili language|Swahili]] names by the Comorian government. They are [[Grande Comore]] (Njazidja), [[Moh\u00e9li]] (Mwali), [[Anjouan]] (Nzwani), and [[Mayotte]] (Mahor\u00e9). The islands' distance from each other\u2014Grande Comore is some 200 kilometers from Mayotte, forty kilometers from Moh\u00e9li, and eighty kilometers from Grande Comore\u2014along with a lack of good harbor facilities, make transportation and communication difficult. \n\n==Details==\nThe islands have a total land area of 2,236 square kilometers (including Mayotte), and claim territorial waters of 320 square kilometers. [[Mount Karthala]] (2316 m) on Grande Comore is an active volcano.  From April 17 to 19, 2005, the volcano began spewing ash and gas, forcing as many as 10,000 people to flee. Comoros is located within the [[Somali plate]].\n\n'''[[Geographic coordinates]]:'''\n{{coord|12|10|S|44|15|E|type:country}}\n\n==Grande Comore==\nGrande Comore is the largest island, sixty-seven kilometers long and twenty-seven kilometers wide, with a total area of 1,146 square kilometers. The most recently formed of the four islands in the archipelago, it is also of volcanic origin. Two volcanoes form the island's most prominent topographic features: La Grille in the north, with an elevation of 1,000 meters, is extinct and largely eroded; Kartala in the south, rising to a height of 2,361 meters, last erupted in 1977. A plateau averaging 600 to 700 meters high connects the two mountains. Because Grande Comore is geologically a relatively new island, its soil is thin and rocky and cannot hold water. As a result, water from the island's heavy rainfall must be stored in catchment tanks. There are no coral reefs along the coast, and the island lacks a good harbor for ships. One of the largest remnants of the Comoros' once-extensive rain forests is on the slopes of Kartala. The national capital has been at Moroni since 1962.\n\n==Anjouan==\nAnjouan, triangular shaped and forty kilometers from apex to base, has an area of 424 square kilometers. Three mountain chains \u2014 Sima, Nioumakele, and Jimilime\u2014emanate from a central peak, Mtingui (1,575 m), giving the island its distinctive shape. Older than Grande Comore, Anjouan has deeper soil cover, but overcultivation has caused serious erosion. A [[coral reef]] lies close to shore; the island's capital of [[Mutsamudu]] is also its main port.\n\n==Moh\u00e9li==\nMoh\u00e9li is thirty kilometers long and twelve kilometers wide, with an area of 290 square kilometers. It is the smallest of the four islands and has a central mountain chain reaching 860 meters at its highest. Like Grande Comore, it retains stands of rain forest. Moh\u00e9li's capital is Fomboni.\n\n==Mayotte==\nMayotte, geologically the oldest of the four islands, is thirty-nine kilometers long and twenty-two kilometers wide, totaling 375 square kilometers, and its highest points are between 500 and 600 meters above sea level. Because of greater weathering of the volcanic rock, the soil is relatively rich in some areas. A well-developed coral reef that encircles much of the island ensures protection for ships and a habitat for fish. Dzaoudzi, capital of the Comoros until 1962 and now Mayotte's administrative center, is situated on a rocky outcropping off the east shore of the main island. Dzaoudzi is linked by a causeway to le Pamanzi, which at ten kilometers in area is the largest of several islets adjacent to Mayotte. Islets are also scattered in the coastal waters of Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Moh\u00e9li.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nComorian waters are the habitat of the [[coelacanth]], a rare fish with limblike fins and a cartilaginous skeleton, the fossil remains of which date as far back as 400 million years and which was once thought to have become extinct about 70 million years ago.  A live specimen was caught in 1938 off southern Africa; other coelacanths have since been found in the vicinity of the Comoro Islands.\n\nSeveral mammals are unique to the islands themselves.  Livingstone's fruit bat, although plentiful when discovered by explorer David Livingstone in 1863, has been reduced to a population of about 120, entirely on Anjouan.  The world's largest bat, the jet-black Livingstone fruit bat has a wingspan of nearly two meters.  A British preservation group sent an expedition to the Comoros in 1992 to bring some of the bats to Britain to establish a breeding population.\n\nA hybrid of the [[common brown lemur]] (''Eulemur fulvus'') originally from Madagascar, was introduced by humans prior to European colonization and is found on Mayotte.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=400}}  The [[mongoose lemur]] (''Eulemur mongoz''), also introduced from Madagascar by humans, can be found on the islands of Moh\u00e9li and Anjouan.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=446}}\n\n22 species of bird are unique to the archipelago and 17 of these are restricted to the Union of the Comoros. These include the [[Karthala scops-owl]], [[Anjouan scops-owl]] and [[Humblot's flycatcher]].<ref>Ian Sinclair & Olivier Langrand (2003) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=v7orZe55T5EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Birds of the Indian Ocean Islands]'', Struik, Cape Town.</ref>\n\nPartly in response to international pressures, Comorians in the 1990s have become more concerned about the environment.  Steps are being taken not only to preserve the rare fauna, but also to counteract degradation of the environment, especially on densely populated Anjouan.  Specifically, to minimize the cutting down of trees for fuel, [[kerosene]] is being subsidized, and efforts are being made to replace the loss of the forest cover caused by ylang-ylang distillation for perfume.  The Community Development Support Fund, sponsored by the International Development Association (IDA, a World Bank affiliate) and the Comorian government, is working to improve water supply on the islands as well.\n\n==Climate==\n{{See also|Comoro Islands#Climate|l1=Climate}}\n\nThe climate is marine tropical, with two seasons: hot and humid from November to April, the result of the northeastern monsoon, and a cooler, drier season the rest of the year. Average monthly temperatures range from {{convert|23|to|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} along the coasts. Although the average annual precipitation is {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|sp=us}}, water is a scarce commodity in many parts of the Comoros. Moh\u00e9li and Mayotte possess streams and other natural sources of water, but Grande Comore and Anjouan, whose mountainous landscapes retain water poorly, are almost devoid of naturally occurring running water. Cyclones, occurring during the hot and wet season, can cause extensive damage, especially in coastal areas. On the average, at least twice each decade houses, farms, and harbor facilities are devastated by these great storms.\n\n== Extreme points ==\n\nThis is a list of the extreme points of the Comoros, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

Although Islamic culture is firmly established throughout, a small minority are [[Christian]].\n\nThe most common language is [[Comorian language|Comorian]], related to [[Swahili language|Swahili]].

Overall population density increased to about 285 persons per square kilometer by 1994.\nBy comparison, estimates of the population density per square kilometer of the Indian Ocean's other island microstates ranged from 241 (Seychelles) to 690 (Maldives) in 1993. Given the rugged terrain of Ngazidja and Nzwani, and the dedication of extensive tracts to agriculture on all three islands, population pressures on the Comoros are becoming increasingly critical.\n\nThe age structure of the population of the Comoros is similar to that of many developing countries, in that the republic has a very large proportion of young people. In 1989, 46.4 percent of the population was under fifteen years of age, an above-average proportion even for [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. The population's rate of growth was a relatively high 3.5 percent per annum in the mid 1980s, up substantially from 2.0 percent in the mid-1970s and 2.1 percent in the mid-1960s.\n\nIn 1983 the Abdallah regime borrowed US$2.85 million from the [[International Development Association]] to devise a national [[family planning]] program. However, Islamic reservations about [[contraception]] made forthright advocacy and implementation of [[birth control]] programs politically hazardous, and consequently little was done in the way of public policy.\n\nThe Comorian population has become increasingly [[urbanisation|urbanized]] in recent years. In 1991 the percentage of Comorians residing in cities and towns of more than 5,000 persons was about 30 percent, up from 25 percent in 1985 and 23 percent in 1980. The Comoros' largest cities were the capital, [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]], with about 30,000 people, and the port city of [[Mutsamudu]], on the island of Nzwani, with about 20,000 people.\n\nMigration among the various islands is important. Natives of [[Nzwani]] have settled in significant numbers on less crowded [[Mwali]], causing some social tensions, and many Nzwani also migrate to Maore. In 1977 Maore expelled peasants from Ngazidja and Nzwani who had recently settled in large numbers on the island. Some were allowed to reenter starting in 1981 but solely as migrant labor.\n\nThe number of Comorians living abroad has been estimated at between 80,000 and 100,000; during the colonial period, most of them lived in [[Tanzania]], [[Madagascar]], and other parts of [[Southeast Africa]]. The number of Comorians residing in Madagascar was drastically reduced after anti-Comorian rioting in December 1976 in [[Mahajanga]], in which at least 1,400 Comorians were killed. As many as 17,000 Comorians left Madagascar to seek refuge in their native land in 1977 alone. About 100,000 Comorians live in France; many of them had gone there for a university education and never returned. Small numbers of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]], [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]], [[South Africa]]ns, and Europeans (mostly [[French people|French]]) live on the islands and play an important role in the economy. Most French left after independence in 1975.\n\nSome [[Persian Gulf]] countries started buying Comorian [[citizenship]] for their [[Statelessness|stateless]] [[bidoon]] residents and deporting them to Comoros.<ref>http://icfuae.org.uk/research-and-publications/stateless-and-sale-gulf</ref><ref>https://stepfeed.com/kuwait-trying-to-sell-its-bidoon-population-to-comoros-3979</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/the-bizarre-scheme-to-transform-a-remote-island-into-new-dubai-comoros</ref>\n\n==Population==\n[[Image:Comoros-demography.png|thumb|right|Demographics of the Comoros, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]\n\n===UN population projections===\nUN medium variant projections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Excel-Data/population.htm |title=World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision |publisher=Esa.un.org |date=2011-06-28 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!\n!

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in both the government and parliament.\n\nAs of 2008, [[Comoros]] and [[Mauritania]] were considered by [[United States|US]]-based organization [[Freedom House]] as the only real \u201c[[Electoral democracy|electoral democracies]]\u201d of the [[Arab World]].<ref>[http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&year=2008 Freedom House Country Report 2008]</ref>\n\n==Political background==\nThe Union of the Comoros, known as the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros until 2003, is ruled by [[Ahmed Abdallah Sambi]]. The political situation in Comoros has been extremely fluid since the country's independence in 1975, subject to the volatility of coups and political insurrection. Colonel [[Azali Assoumani]] seized power in a bloodless coup in April 1999, overthrowing Interim President [[Tadjidine Ben Said Massounde]], who himself had held the office since the death of democratically elected President [[Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim]] in November, 1998. \n\nIn May 1999, Azali decreed a constitution that gave him both executive and legislative powers. Bowing somewhat to international criticism, Azali appointed a civilian Prime Minister, [[Bainrifi Tarmidi]], in December 1999; however, Azali retained the mantle of Head of State and army Commander. In December 2000, Azali named a new civilian Prime Minister, [[Hamada Madi]], and formed a new civilian Cabinet. When Azali took power he also pledged to step down in April 2000 and relinquish control to a democratically elected president\u2014a pledge with mixed results.\n\nIn a separate nod to pressure to restore civilian rule, the government organized several committees to compose a new constitution, including the August 2000 National Congress and November 2000 Tripartite Commission. The opposition parties initially refused to participate in the Tripartite Commission, but on 17 February, representatives of the government, the Anjouan separatists, the political opposition, and civil society organizations signed a \"Framework Accord for Reconciliation in Comoros,\" brokered by the [[Organization for African Unity]]\n\nThe accord called for the creation of a new [[Tripartite Commission for National Reconciliation]] to develop a \"New Comorian Entity\" with a new constitution. The new federal Constitution came into effect in 2002; it included elements of [[consociationalism]], including a presidency that rotates every four years among the islands and extensive autonomy for each island. [[Comoros Presidential elections, 2002|Presidential elections]] were held in 2002, at which Azali Assoumani was elected President. In April 2004 [[Comoros legislative election, 2004|legislative elections]] were held, completing the implementation of the new constitution. \n\nThe new Union of the Comoros consists of three islands, [[Grande Comore]], [[Anjouan]] and [[Moh\u00e9li]].

The constitution states that, \"the islands enjoy financial autonomy, freely draw up and manage their budgets\".\n\nPresident Assoumani Azali of Grande Comore is the first Union president.

The [[Comoros]] possesses {{convert|880|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of road, of which {{convert|673|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} are paved.  It has three seaports: [[Fomboni]], [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]] and [[Moutsamoudou]], but does not have a merchant marine, and no longer has any railway network.  It has four airports, all with paved runways, one with runways over {{convert|2438|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, with the others having runways shorter than {{convert|1523|m|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe isolation of the Comoros had made air traffic a major means of transportation. One of President Abdallah's accomplishments was to make the Comoros more accessible by air. During his administration, he negotiated agreements to initiate or enhance commercial air links with Tanzania and Madagascar. The Djohar regime reached an agreement in 1990 to link Moroni and Brussels by air. By the early 1990s, commercial flights connected the Comoros with France, Mauritius, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Madagascar. The national airline was Air Comores. Daily flights linked the three main islands, and air service was also available to Mahor\u00e9; each island had airstrips. In 1986 the republic received a grant from the French government's CCCE to renovate and expand [[Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport|Hahaya airport]], near Moroni. Because of the absence of scheduled sea transport between the islands, nearly all interisland passenger traffic is by air.\n\nMore than 99% of freight is transported by sea. Both Moroni on Njazidja and Mutsamudu on Nzwani have artificial harbors. There is also a harbor at Fomboni, on Mwali. Despite extensive internationally financed programs to upgrade the harbors at Moroni and Mutsamudu, by the early 1990s only Mutsamudu was operational as a deepwater facility. Its harbor could accommodate vessels of up to eleven meters' draught. At Moroni, ocean-going vessels typically lie offshore and are loaded or unloaded by smaller craft, a costly and sometimes dangerous procedure. Most freight continues to be sent to Kenya, Reunion, or Madagascar for transshipment to the Comoros. Use of Comoran ports is further restricted by the threat of cyclones from December through March. The privately operated Comoran Navigation Company (''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Comorienne de Navigation'') is based in Moroni, and provides services to Madagascar.\n\nRoads serve the coastal areas, rather than the interior, and the mountainous terrain makes surface travel difficult.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Africa}}\n*[[History of rail transport in the Comoros]]\n\n==References==\n*Much of the material in this article is adapted from the ''[[CIA World Factbook]].''\n*{{Country study|country= Comoros|abbr=km|author=Vincent Ercolano|section=Transportation and Telecommunications|date=1994|editor=Helen Chapin Metz}}\n{{Comoros topics}}\n{{Economy of Comoros}}\n{{Africa in topic|Transport in}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Transport In Comoros}}\n[[Category:Transport in the Comoros| ]]\n\n\n{{Comoros-stub}}", "sha1": "jvmvexkmjo2d8xcydgjbtr03yzl30yt"}}, {"title": "Foreign relations of the Comoros", "ns": "0", "id": "6007", "revision": {"id": "865482713", "parentid": "852477593", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T07:03:58Z", "contributor": {"username": "JojoZul69", "id": "31674037"}, "comment": "/* Bilateral relations */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Politics of Comoros}}\nIn November 1975, [[Comoros]] became the 143rd member of the [[United Nations]].

Administered by Li Guoqiao at the Tropical Medicine Institute, the program relies on hybrid [[Artemisia annua]] of hybrid ancestry, which was used for a drug regimen by which all residents of the island, whether or not visibly ill, took two doses at a 40-day interval. This eliminated the human reservoir of the disease and reduced hospital admissions to 1% or less of January 2008 levels. Visitors to Moheli are now required to take antimalarial drugs, a mix of [[artemisinin]], [[primaquine]] and [[pyrimethamine]] that China provides for free. When asked about Artemisia exports, Li was quoted, \"We want to grow them in China and whatever we export depends on bilateral relationships.\" Comoros has requested a similar program for [[Grande Comore]] and [[Anjouan]], total population 760,000, and Li said that Beijing has agreed in principle.<ref>Africa: Ending Malaria in Sight?

However, as the [[Morris worm]] and [[Mydoom]] showed, even these \"payload-free\" worms can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic and other unintended effects.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Morris Worm.jpg|thumb|[[Morris worm]] source code floppy diskette at the [[Computer History Museum]]]]\nThe actual term \"worm\" was first used in [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s 1975 novel, ''[[The Shockwave Rider]]''. In that novel, Nichlas Haflinger designs and sets off a data-gathering worm in an act of revenge against the powerful men who run a national electronic information web that induces mass conformity. \"You have the biggest-ever worm loose in the net, and it automatically sabotages any attempt to monitor it...

Typical malicious payloads might delete files on a host system (e.g., the [[ExploreZip]] worm), encrypt files in a [[ransomware]] attack, or [[Data theft|exfiltrate data]] such as confidential documents or passwords. \n\nProbably the most common payload for worms is to install a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]. This allows the computer to be remotely controlled by the worm author as a \"[[zombie computers|zombie]]\". Networks of such machines are often referred to as [[botnets]] and are very commonly used for a range of malicious purposes, including sending [[e-mail spam|spam]] or performing [[Denial-of-service attack|DoS]] attacks.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001859752_spamdoubles18.html |newspaper=The Seattle Times |title=Business & Technology: E-mail viruses blamed as spam rises sharply |date=February 18, 2004 |first=Tiernan |last=Ray }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,60747,00.html |title=Cloaking Device Made for Spammers |newspaper=Wired |date=October 9, 2003 |first=Brian |last=McWilliams }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/68810/1/.html |title=Mydoom Internet worm likely from Russia, linked to spam mail: security firm |website=www.channelnewsasia.com |date=31 January 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219193824/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/68810/1/.html |archive-date=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/44879 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090528002116/http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/44879 |archivedate= 2009-05-28 |work=Hiese online |title= Uncovered: Trojans as Spam Robots |date= 2004-02-21 |accessdate= 2012-11-02 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3513849.stm |work=BBC News |title= Hacker threats to bookies probed |date= February 23, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n== Countermeasures ==\nWorms spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems.<!-- NOTE: this statement is erroneous. a Trojan horse is a category similar to a [[master status]].

The use of a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] is also recommended.\n\nIn the April\u2013June 2008 issue of ''[[IEEE]] Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing'', computer scientists described a new and potentially effective way to combat internet worms. The researchers discovered how to contain worms that scanned the Internet randomly, looking for vulnerable hosts to infect. They found that the key was to use software to monitor the number of scans that machines on a network send out. When a machine started to send out too many scans, it was a sign that it has been infected, which allowed administrators to take it off line and check it for malware.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?isnumber=4509574&arnumber=4358715&count=10&index=3 |last=Sellke |first=S.

The [[Nachi worm|Nachi]] family of worms tried to download and install patches from Microsoft's website to fix vulnerabilities in the host system\u2014by exploiting those same vulnerabilities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virus alert about the Nachi worm|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/826234|publisher=Microsoft}}</ref> In practice, although this may have made these systems more secure, it generated considerable network traffic, rebooted the machine in the course of patching it, and did its work without the consent of the computer's owner or user. Regardless of their payload or their writers' intentions, most security experts regard all worms as [[malware]].\n\nSeveral worms, like [[XSS Worm|XSS worms]], have been written to research how worms spread. For example, the effects of changes in social activity or user behavior. One study proposed what seems to be the first computer worm that operates on the second layer of the OSI model (Data link Layer), it utilizes topology information such as Content-addressable memory (CAM) tables and Spanning Tree information stored in switches to propagate and probe for vulnerable nodes until the enterprise network is covered.<ref name=\"semiauto_worm\">{{Cite book | doi = 10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546723| chapter = A link-layer-based self-replicating vulnerability discovery agent| title = The IEEE symposium on Computers and Communications| pages = 704| year = 2010| last1 = Al-Salloum | first1 = Z.

A rule may be applied by replacing an occurrence of the symbols on its left-hand side with those that appear on its right-hand side.  A sequence of rule applications is called a ''derivation''.  Such a grammar defines the formal language: all words consisting solely of terminal symbols which can be reached by a derivation from the start symbol.\n\nNonterminals are often represented by uppercase letters, terminals by lowercase letters, and the start symbol by {{mvar|S}}.

While these sentences are nonsensical, they are syntactically correct. A syntactically incorrect sentence ( e.g. \"''ideas ideas great hate''\") cannot be derived from this grammar. See \"[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]\" for a similar example given by Chomsky in 1957; see [[Phrase structure grammar]] and [[Phrase structure rules]] for more [[natural language]] examples and the problems of [[formal grammar]] in that area.\n\n== The hierarchy ==\n[[Image:Chomsky-hierarchy.svg|thumb|right|200px|alt=The Chomsky hierarchy|Set inclusions described by the Chomsky hierarchy]]\nThe following table summarizes each of Chomsky's four types of grammars, the class of language it generates, the type of automaton that recognizes it, and the form its rules must have.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Grammar\n! Languages\n! Automaton\n! Production rules (constraints)*\n|-\n| Type-0\n| [[recursively enumerable language|Recursively enumerable]]\n| [[Turing machine]]\n| <math>\\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta</math> (where <math>\\alpha</math> contains at least one non-terminal)\n|-\n| Type-1\n| [[context-sensitive grammar|Context-sensitive]]\n| [[Linear bounded automaton|Linear-bounded non-deterministic Turing machine]]\n| <math>\\alpha A \\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha \\gamma \\beta</math>\n|-\n| Type-2\n| [[context-free grammar|Context-free]]\n| Non-deterministic [[pushdown automaton]]\n| <math>A \\rightarrow \\gamma</math>\n|-\n| Type-3\n| [[regular grammar|Regular]]\n| [[Finite state automaton]]\n| <math>A \\rightarrow \\text{a}</math><br /> and<br /><math>A \\rightarrow \\text{a}B</math>\n|-\n|colspan=4|* Meaning of symbols:<br />\n<math>\\text{a}</math> = terminal<br />\n<math>\\alpha</math> = string of terminals, non-terminals, or empty<br />\n<math>\\beta</math> = string of terminals, non-terminals, or empty<br />\n<math>\\gamma</math> = string of terminals, non-terminals, never empty<br />\n<math>A</math> = non-terminal<br />\n<math>B</math> = non-terminal<br />\n|}\n\nNote that the set of grammars corresponding to [[recursive language]]s is not a member of this hierarchy; these would be properly between Type-0 and Type-1.\n\nEvery regular language is context-free, every context-free language is context-sensitive, every context-sensitive language is recursive and every recursive language is recursively enumerable. These are all proper inclusions, meaning that there exist recursively enumerable languages that are not context-sensitive, context-sensitive languages that are not context-free and context-free languages that are not regular.\n\n===Type-0 grammars===\n{{main|Unrestricted grammar}}\n\nType-0 grammars include all formal grammars. They generate exactly all languages that can be recognized by a [[Turing machine]]. These languages are also known as the [[recursively enumerable language|''recursively enumerable'']] or ''Turing-recognizable'' languages.<ref name=Sipser-1st>{{cite book|author = [[Michael Sipser]] | year = 1997 | title = Introduction to the Theory of Computation 1st |quote=The Church-Turing Thesis (Page 130) |publisher =Cengage Learning |isbn=0-534-94728-X}}</ref>  Note that this is different from the [[recursive language]]s, which can be ''decided'' by an [[machine that always halts|always-halting Turing machine]].\n\n===Type-1 grammars===\n{{main|Context-sensitive grammar}}\n\nType-1 grammars generate [[context-sensitive language]]s.  These grammars have rules of the form <math>\\alpha A\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha\\gamma\\beta</math> with <math>A</math> a nonterminal and <math>\\alpha</math>, <math>\\beta</math> and <math>\\gamma</math> strings of terminals and/or nonterminals. The strings <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math> may be empty, but <math>\\gamma</math> must be nonempty.  The rule <math>S \\rightarrow \\epsilon</math> is allowed if <math>S</math> does not appear on the right side of any rule.  The languages described by these grammars are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a [[linear bounded automaton]] (a nondeterministic Turing machine whose tape is bounded by a constant times the length of the input.)\n\n===Type-2 grammars===\n{{main|Context-free grammar}}\n\nType-2 grammars generate the [[context-free language]]s. These are defined by rules of the form <math>A \\rightarrow \\gamma</math> with <math>A</math> being a nonterminal and <math>\\gamma</math> being a string of terminals and/or nonterminals. These languages are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a non-deterministic [[pushdown automaton]]. Context-free languages\u2014or rather its subset of [[deterministic context-free language]]\u2014are the theoretical basis for the phrase structure of most [[programming language]]s, though their syntax also includes context-sensitive name resolution due to declarations and [[Scope (computer science)|scope]]. Often a subset of grammars is used to make parsing easier, such as by an [[LL parser]].\n\n===Type-3 grammars===\n{{main|Regular grammar}}\n\nType-3 grammars generate the [[regular language]]s.  Such a grammar restricts its rules to a single nonterminal on the left-hand side and a right-hand side consisting of a single terminal, possibly followed by a single nonterminal (right regular). Alternatively, the right-hand side of the grammar can consist of a single terminal, possibly preceded by a single nonterminal (left regular). These generate the same languages. However, if left-regular rules and right-regular rules are combined, the language need no longer be regular. The rule <math>S \\rightarrow \\epsilon</math> is also allowed here if <math>S</math> does not appear on the right side of any rule.  These languages are exactly all languages that can be decided by a [[finite state automaton]]. Additionally, this family of formal languages can be obtained by [[regular expression]]s. Regular languages are commonly used to define search patterns and the lexical structure of programming languages.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite journal\n | last = Chomsky\n | first = Noam\n | authorlink= Noam Chomsky\n | date = 1959\n | title = On certain formal properties of grammars\n | volume = 2\n | journal = Information and Control\n | doi = 10.1016/S0019-9958(59)90362-6\n | issue = 2\n | pages = 137\u2013167\n | url = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~cannata/pl/Class%20Notes/Chomsky_1959%20On%20Certain%20Formal%20Properties%20of%20Grammars.pdf |format=PDF\n }}\n*{{cite book\n | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = Noam  | authorlink= Noam Chomsky\n | last2=Sch\u00fctzenberger |first2=Marcel P.\n | editor1-last=Braffort |editor1-first=P. |editor2-last=Hirschberg |editor2-first=D.\n | date = 1963\n | title =  Computer Programming and Formal Languages\n | chapter = The algebraic theory of context free languages\n | publisher = North Holland\n | location = Amsterdam\n | pages = 118\u2013161\n }}\n*{{Cite book\n | last1=Davis |first1=Martin D.\n | last2=Sigal |first2=Ron\n | last3=Weyuker |first3=Elaine J.\n | date=1994\n | title=Computability, Complexity, and Languages: Fundamentals of Theoretical Computer Science\n | edition=2nd\n | publisher=Academic Press, Harcourt, Brace \n | location=Boston  \n | isbn=0-12-206382-1 \n | page=327\n }}\n\n{{Formal languages and grammars}}\n{{Noam Chomsky}}\n\n[[Category:1956 in computer science]]\n[[Category:Formal languages]]\n[[Category:Generative linguistics]]\n[[Category:Noam Chomsky|Hierarchy, Chomsky]]\n[[Category:Equivalence classes]]", "sha1": "hjnb48lku8mvqgc4te98icii419faz5"}}, {"title": "Churchs thesis", "ns": "0", "id": "6012", "redirect": {"title": "Church\u2013Turing thesis"}, "revision": {"id": "24409352", "parentid": "15904177", "timestamp": "2005-09-30T16:27:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "Psychonaut", "id": "28478"}, "comment": "#REDIRECT [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]]", "sha1": "bodi0okxo9b39oj96sg5sd0rqekq943"}}, {"title": "CRT", "ns": "0", "id": "6013", "revision": {"id": "863086353", "parentid": "858285234", "timestamp": "2018-10-08T16:47:38Z", "contributor": {"ip": "84.115.230.94"}, "comment": "/* Technology */ added  Close-ratio transmission", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{wiktionary|CRT}}\n'''CRT''' may refer to:\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Science==\n===Biology===\n* [[CRT (genetics)]], a gene cluster\n* [[Calreticulin]], a protein\n\n===Medicine===\n* [[Capillary refill]] time, the rate at which blood refills empty capillaries \n* [[Cognitive Retention Therapy]], a dementia treatment\n* [[Cardiac resynchronization therapy]], a treatment for heart failure\n** CRT-D, an [[implanted cardiac resynchronization device]]\n* [[Corneal Refractive Therapy]], in optometrics\n* [[Certified Respiratory Therapist]], a respiratory therapist who works under the direction of Registered respiratory therapists and Physicians\n* Chemo-radiotherapy - a combination of [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]] e.g. to treat cancer.\n\n===Mathematics===\n* [[Chinese remainder theorem]], in mathematics\n* [[Crystallographic restriction theorem]], in mathematics\n* [[Crater (constellation)]] (abbreviation), a constellation\n\n==Technology==\n* [[Cathode ray tube]], a type of vacuum tube used for information displays (monitors or TVs) or oscilloscopes\n* [[Computer monitor]] \u2013 acronym for a screen using '''C'''athode '''R'''ay '''T'''ube technology, especially pre-LCD\n* C runtime library, part of the [[C standard library]] for the C programming language\n* [[SecureCRT]], a telnet client by VanDyke Software, formerly CRT\n* [[Close-ratio transmission]], a transmission type\n*.crt \u2013 [[X.509#Certificate filename extensions|X.509 Certificate filename extension]] normally issued by a [[Certificate authority|CA]].

As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most [[X-ray]] emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.\n\nSince the late 2000s, CRTs have been largely superseded by newer \"[[flat panel]]\" display technologies such as [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]], [[plasma display]], and especially [[OLED]] displays, which in the case of LCD and OLED displays have lower manufacturing costs and power consumption, as well as significantly less weight and bulk. Flat panel displays can also be made in very large sizes; whereas {{Convert|38 to 40|in|cm|abbr=on}} was about the largest size of a CRT television, flat panels are available in {{Convert|60|in|cm|abbr=on}} and larger sizes.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Braun cathode ray tube.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Braun's original cold-cathode CRT, 1897]]\n\nCathode rays were discovered by [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] in 1869 in primitive [[Crookes tube]]s. He observed that some unknown rays were emitted from the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) which could cast shadows on the glowing wall of the tube, indicating the rays were traveling in straight lines. In 1890, [[Arthur Schuster]] demonstrated cathode rays could be deflected by [[electric field]]s, and [[William Crookes]] showed they could be deflected by magnetic fields. In 1897, [[J. J. Thomson]] succeeded in measuring the mass of cathode rays, showing that they consisted of negatively charged particles smaller than atoms, the first \"[[subatomic particle]]s\", which were later named ''[[electron]]s''. The earliest version of the CRT was known as the \"Braun tube\", invented by the German physicist [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897.<ref>Ferdinand Braun (1897) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048352892;view=1up;seq=568 \"Ueber ein Verfahren zur Demonstration und zum Studium des zeitlichen Verlaufs variabler Str\u00f6me\"] (On a process for the display and study of the course in time of variable currents), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', 3rd series, '''60''': 552\u2013559.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cathode Ray Tube|year=2007|work=Medical Discoveries|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|url=http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Bar-Cod/Cathode-Ray-Tube-CRT.html|accessdate=27 April 2008}}</ref> It was a [[cold cathode|cold-cathode]] [[diode]], a modification of the [[Crookes tube]] with a [[phosphor]]-coated screen.\n\nThe first cathode ray tube to use a [[hot cathode]] was developed by [[John Bertrand Johnson|John B.

The beam is deflected horizontally by applying an [[electric field]] between a pair of plates to its left and right, and vertically by applying an electric field to plates above and below. Televisions use magnetic rather than electrostatic deflection because the deflection plates obstruct the beam when the deflection angle is as large as is required for tubes that are relatively short for their size.\n\n===Phosphor persistence===\nVarious [[phosphor]]s are available depending upon the needs of the measurement or display application.

Oscilloscope CRTs designed for very fast signals can give a brighter display by passing the electron beam through a [[micro-channel plate]] just before it reaches the screen.

These are distinct from ''[[digital storage oscilloscope]]s'' which rely on solid state digital memory to store the image.\n\nWhere a single brief event is monitored by an oscilloscope, such an event will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, but only for a few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view storage cathode ray tube (storage tube). A storage tube will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A storage tube is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a [[dielectric]] layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.\n\nWhen the main electron gun writes an image to the screen, the energy in the main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily to turn off the flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.<ref>The [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition (1970\u20131979)</ref>\n\n===Data storage tubes===\n{{Main|Williams tube}}\nThe Williams tube or Williams-Kilburn tube was a cathode ray tube used to electronically store binary data. It was used in computers of the 1940s as a random-access digital storage device. In contrast to other CRTs in this article, the Williams tube was not a display device, and in fact could not be viewed since a metal plate covered its screen.\n\n==Color CRTs==\n[[File:CRT screen. closeup.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a delta-gun [[shadow mask]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT Phosphors.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a [[Trinitron]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT_phosphors.png|thumb|right|Spectra of constituent blue, green and red phosphors in a common CRT]]\nColor tubes use three different phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively. They are packed together in stripes (as in [[aperture grille]] designs) or clusters called [[Triad (monitors)|\"triads\"]] (as in [[shadow mask]] CRTs).<ref name=crtmonitorwork>{{cite web |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2006/03/20/how_crt_and_lcd_monitors_work/1 |title=How CRT and LCD monitors work |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=bit-tech.net}}</ref> Color CRTs have three electron guns, one for each primary color, arranged either in a straight line or in an [[equilateral triangle|equilateral triangular]] configuration (the guns are usually constructed as a single unit). (The triangular configuration is often called \"delta-gun\", based on its relation to the shape of the Greek letter delta \u0394.) A grille or mask absorbs the electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor.<ref name=maskgrill>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtMask-c.html |title=The Shadow Mask and Aperture Grill |work=PC Guide}}</ref> A [[shadow mask]] tube uses a metal plate with tiny holes, placed so that the electron beam only illuminates the correct phosphors on the face of the tube;<ref name=crtmonitorwork/> the holes are tapered so that the electrons that strike the inside of any hole will be reflected back, if they are not absorbed (e.g. due to local charge accumulation), instead of bouncing through the hole to strike a random (wrong) spot on the screen. Another type of color CRT uses an [[aperture grille]] of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result.<ref name=maskgrill/>\n\n===Convergence and purity in color CRTs===\nDue to limitations in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, it has not been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, solely on the basis of the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.\n\nColor convergence and color purity are two aspects of this single problem. Firstly, for correct color rendering it is necessary that regardless of where the beams are deflected on the screen, all three hit the same spot (and nominally pass through the same hole or slot) on the shadow mask. This is called convergence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126054428/http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archivedate=26 November 2009|title=Picture This|date=March 2005|author=Norton, Thomas J. |work= UltimateAVmag.com}}</ref> More specifically, the convergence at the center of the screen (with no deflection field applied by the yoke) is called static convergence, and the convergence over the rest of the screen area is called dynamic convergence. The beams may converge at the center of the screen and yet stray from each other as they are deflected toward the edges; such a CRT would be said to have good static convergence but poor dynamic convergence. Secondly, each beam must only strike the phosphors of the color it is intended to strike and no others. This is called purity. Like convergence, there is static purity and dynamic purity, with the same meanings of \"static\" and \"dynamic\" as for convergence. Convergence and purity are distinct parameters; a CRT could have good purity but poor convergence, or vice versa. Poor convergence causes color \"shadows\" or \"ghosts\" along displayed edges and contours, as if the image on the screen were intaglio printed with poor registration. Poor purity causes objects on the screen to appear off-color while their edges remain sharp. Purity and convergence problems can occur at the same time, in the same or different areas of the screen or both over the whole screen, and either uniformly or to greater or lesser degrees over different parts of the screen.\n\nThe solution to the static convergence and purity problems is a set of color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their [[magnetic fields]] parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field [[vector field|vector]] can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [two each for two magnets] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.\n\nOn some CRTs, additional fixed adjustable magnets are added for dynamic convergence or dynamic purity at specific points on the screen, typically near the corners or edges. Further adjustment of dynamic convergence and purity typically cannot be done passively, but requires active compensation circuits.\n\nDynamic color convergence and purity are one of the main reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex [[raster graphics|raster]] geometry parameters through electronics under user control.\n\n===Degaussing===\n[[File:Degauss in progress.jpg|thumb|256px|A degaussing in progress.]]\nIf the shadow mask or aperture grille becomes magnetized, its magnetic field alters the paths of the electron beams. This causes errors of \"color purity\" as the electrons no longer follow only their intended paths, and some will hit some phosphors of colors other than the one intended. For example, some electrons from the red beam may hit blue or green phosphors, imposing a magenta or yellow tint to parts of the image that are supposed to be pure red. (This effect is localized to a specific area of the screen if the magnetization is localized.) Therefore, it is important that the shadow mask or aperture grille not be magnetized. \n\nMost color CRT displays, i.e. television sets and computer monitors, each have a built-in [[degaussing]] (demagnetizing) circuit, the primary component of which is a degaussing coil which is mounted around the perimeter of the CRT face inside the [[wikt:bezel|bezel]]. Upon power-up of the CRT display, the degaussing circuit produces a brief, alternating current through the degaussing coil which smoothly decays in strength (fades out) to zero over a period of a few seconds, producing a decaying alternating magnetic field from the coil. This degaussing field is strong enough to remove shadow mask magnetization in most cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtGauss-c.html|title=Magnetization and Degaussing|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> In unusual cases of strong magnetization where the internal degaussing field is not sufficient, the shadow mask may be degaussed externally with a stronger portable degausser or demagnetizer. However, an excessively strong magnetic field, whether alternating or constant, may mechanically [[deformation (engineering)|deform]] (bend) the shadow mask, causing a permanent color distortion on the display which looks very similar to a magnetization effect.\n\nThe degaussing circuit is often built of a [[thermo-electricity|thermo-electric]] (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic heating element and a positive thermal [[coefficient of thermal expansion|coefficient]] (PTC) [[resistor-capacitor circuit|resistor]], connected directly to the switched [[AC power]] line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance to a point where degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the [[ambient temperature]]; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.\n\nThis simple design is effective and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially [[Energy Star]] rated ones, use a [[relay]] to switch the entire degaussing circuit on and off, so that the degaussing circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through the unit's front panel controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off at the end of the degaussing cycle a few seconds after the monitor is turned on, and on and off during a manually initiated degaussing cycle.\n\n==Vector monitors==\n{{Main|Vector monitor}}\nVector monitors were used in early computer aided design systems and are in some late-1970s to mid-1980s arcade games such as ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title= Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, 1971\u20131984 |author= Van Burnham |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-262-52420-1}}</ref>\nThey draw graphics point-to-point, rather than scanning a raster. Either monochrome or color CRTs can be used in vector displays, and the essential principles of CRT design and operation are the same for either type of display; the main difference is in the beam deflection patterns and circuits.\n\n==CRT resolution==\n[[Dot pitch]] defines the maximum resolution of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, [[moir\u00e9]] appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the shadow mask can render.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.displaymate.com/moire.html |title= Moir\u00e9 Interference Patterns |accessdate=4 October 2006 |work=DisplayMate Technologies website}}</ref> Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moir\u00e9; however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question406.htm |title=What causes the faint horizontal lines on my monitor? |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=HowStuffWorks}}</ref>\n\n==Gamma==\nCRTs have a pronounced [[triode]] characteristic, which results in significant [[gamma correction|gamma]] (a nonlinear relationship in an electron gun between applied video voltage and beam intensity).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |title=Gamma correction |accessdate=4 October 2009 |last=Robin |first=Michael |date=1 January 2005 |work=BroadcastEngineering |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531130845/http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |archivedate=31 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Other types==\n\n===Cat's eye===\n{{Main|Magic eye tube}}\nIn better quality old-fashioned tube radio sets, a tuning guide consisting of a phosphor tube was used to aid the tuning adjustment. This was also known as a \"Magic Eye\" or \"Tuning Eye\". Tuning would be adjusted until the width of a radial shadow was minimized. This was used instead of a more expensive electromechanical meter, which later came to be used on higher-end tuners when transistor sets lacked the high voltage required to drive the device.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |title=Tuning-Eye Tubes |accessdate=1 December 2009 |publisher=vacuumtube.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423055711/http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |archivedate=23 April 2009}}</ref> The same type of device was used with tape recorders as a recording level meter, and for various other applications including electrical test equipment.\n\n===Charactrons===\n{{Main|Charactron}}\nSome displays for early computers (those that needed to display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used Charactron CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask ([[stencil]]), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so a second set of deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed toward the center of the screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2735956|title=CATHODE RAY APPARATUS|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2824250|title=INPUT|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nimo===\n{{Main|Nimo tube}}\n[[File:Nimo tube BA0000-P31 showing digit 9.jpg|thumb|right|Nimo tube BA0000-P31]]\nNimo was the trademark of a family of small specialised CRTs manufactured by Industrial Electronics Engineers. These had 10 electron guns which produced electron beams in the form of digits in a manner similar to that of the charactron. The tubes were either simple single-digit displays or more complex 4- or 6- digit displays produced by means of a suitable magnetic deflection system. Having little of the complexities of a standard CRT, the tube required a relatively simple driving circuit, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it provided a much wider viewing angle than competitive types (e.g., [[nixie tube]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/dat_arch/BA0000-P31.pdf |title=IEE Nimo CRT 10-gun readout tube datasheet |format=PDF |work=tube-tester.com|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Flood beam CRT===\n{{Main|Electron-stimulated luminescence}}\nFlood beam CRTs are small tubes that are arranged as pixels for large screens like [[Jumbotron]]<nowiki/>s. The first screen using this technology was introduced by [[Mitsubishi Electric]] for the [[1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. It differs from a normal CRT in that the electron gun within does not produce a focused controllable beam. Instead, electrons are sprayed in a wide cone across the entire front of the phosphor screen, basically making each unit act as a single light bulb.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/articleview.php?item=947|title= Futaba TL-3508XA 'Jumbotron' Display|date= 11 March 2010|accessdate= 2014-12-19|website= The Vintage Technology Association: Military Industrial Electronics Research Preservation|publisher= The Vintage Technology Association}}</ref> Each one is coated with a red, green or blue phosphor, to make up the color sub-pixels.

According to iSupply, production in units of CRTs was not surpassed by LCDs production until 4Q 2007, owing largely to CRT production at factories in China.{{cn|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Causes===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nCRTs, despite advances, remained relatively heavy and cumbersome in comparison to other display technologies. CRT screens had much deeper cabinets compared to flat panels and rear-projection displays for a given screen size; it was largely impractical to build or use CRTs larger than {{convert|40|in|cm|0}}. The CRT disadvantages became especially significant in light of rapid technological advancements in [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] and plasma flat-panels, which allowed them to easily surpass these size limitations while also being thin and wall-mountable (two key features that were increasingly being preferred by customers).\n\n==Health concerns==\n\n===Ionizing radiation===\nCRTs can emit a small amount of [[X-ray]] radiation as a result of the electron beam's bombardment of the shadow mask/aperture grille and phosphors. The amount of radiation escaping the front of the monitor is widely considered not to be harmful. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations in {{CodeFedReg|21|1020|10}} are used to strictly limit, for instance, television receivers to 0.5 [[Roentgen (unit)|milliroentgens]] per hour (mR/h) (0.13&nbsp;\u00b5C/(kg\u00b7h) or 36&nbsp;pA/kg) at a distance of {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} from any external surface; since 2007, most CRTs have emissions that fall well below this limit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=1020.10 |title=SUBCHAPTER J\u2014RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH (21CFR1020.10) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=13 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Toxicity===\nOlder color and monochrome CRTs may have been manufactured with toxic substances, such as [[cadmium]], in the phosphors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |title=Toxic TVs |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=Electronics TakeBack Coalition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227041627/http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |archivedate=27 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |title=Occupational Risks Associated with Electronics Demanufacturing and CRT Glass Processing Operations and the Impact of Mitigation Activities on Employee Safety and Health |accessdate=20 January 2011 |author1=Peters-Michaud, Neil |author2=Katers, John |author3=Barry, Jim |format=PDF |work=Cascade Asset Management, LLC |publisher=Basel Action Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012352/http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanelements.com/cdm.html |title=Cadmium |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=[[American Elements]]}}</ref> The rear glass tube of modern CRTs may be made from [[lead glass|leaded glass]], which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |title=CHARACTERIZATION OF LEAD LEACHABILITY FROM CATHODE RAY TUBES USING THE TOXICITY CHARACTERISTIC LEACHING PROCEDURE (TCLP) |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012228/http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref> By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though the rear of the CRT was still produced from leaded glass. Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough leaded glass to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leach (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to leaded glass crystalware).\n\n=== Recycling ===\nDue to the toxins contained in CRT monitors the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] created rules (in October 2001) stating that CRTs must be brought to special [[Electronic waste|e-waste recycling]] facilities. In November 2002, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] began fining companies that disposed of CRTs through [[landfill]]s or [[incineration]]. Regulatory agencies, local and statewide, monitor the disposal of CRTs and other computer equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/recycling/electron/index.htm|title=Final Rules on Cathode Ray Tubes and Discarded Mercury-Containing Equipment|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nVarious states participate in the recycling of CRTs, each with their reporting requirements for collectors and recycling facilities. For example, in California the recycling of CRTs is governed by CALRecycle, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery through their Payment System. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/electronics/cew|title=Covered Electronic Waste Payment System|first=State of|last=California|website=www.calrecycle.ca.gov}}</ref>. Recycling facilities that accept CRT devices from business and residential sector must obtain contact information such as address and phone number to ensure the CRTs come from a California source in order to participate in the CRT Recycling Payment System. \n\nIn Europe, disposal of CRT televisions and monitors is covered by the [[WEEE Directive]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm-group.com/recycling/WEEEandCRTProcessing.htm |title=WEEE and CRT Processing |accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Flicker===\n{{Main|Flicker (screen)}}\nAt low [[refresh rate]]s (60&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and below), the periodic scanning of the display may produce a flicker that some people perceive more easily than others, especially when viewed with [[peripheral vision]]. Flicker is commonly associated with CRT as most televisions run at 50&nbsp;Hz (PAL) or 60&nbsp;Hz (NTSC), although there are some 100&nbsp;Hz PAL televisions that are [[flicker-free]]. Typically only low-end monitors run at such low frequencies, with most computer monitors supporting at least 75&nbsp;Hz and high-end monitors capable of 100&nbsp;Hz or more to eliminate any perception of flicker.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcmech.com/article/crt-monitor-flickering/|title=CRT Monitor Flickering?|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> Though the 100 Hz PAL was often achieved using interleaved scanning, dividing the circuit and scan into two beams of 50 Hz. Non-computer CRTs or CRT for [[sonar]] or [[radar]] may have long [[Image persistence|persistence]] phosphor and are thus flicker free. If the persistence is too long on a video display, moving images will be blurred.\n\n===High-frequency audible noise===\n50&nbsp;Hz/60&nbsp;Hz CRTs used for television operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734&nbsp;Hz (for [[NTSC]] systems) or 15,625&nbsp;Hz (for [[PAL]] systems).<ref>{{cite book |last= Netravali |first= Arun N. |author2=Haskell, Barry G. |title= Digital pictures: representation, compression, and standards |publisher= Plenum Publishing Corporation |year= 1995 |page= 100 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=-TXYfZrCBuQC&pg=PA100 |isbn=978-0-306-44917-8}}</ref> These frequencies are at the upper range of [[human hearing]] and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/comp/crt/failWhine-c.html |title=The monitor is producing a high-pitched whine |accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> The sound is due to [[magnetostriction]] in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the [[flyback transformer]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}\n\nThis problem does not occur on 100/120&nbsp;Hz TVs and on non-CGA (Color Graphics Adapter) computer displays, because they use much higher horizontal scanning frequencies (22&nbsp;kHz to over 100&nbsp;kHz).\n\n===Implosion===\nHigh [[vacuum]] inside glass-walled cathode ray tubes permits electron beams to fly freely\u2014without colliding into molecules of air or other gas.

This is many times greater than household power supply voltage. Even after the power supply is turned off, some associated capacitors and the CRT itself may retain  a charge for some time and therefore dissipate that charge suddenly through a ground such as an inattentive human grounding a capacitor  discharge lead.\n\n==Security concerns==\nUnder some circumstances, the signal radiated from the [[electron gun]]s, scanning circuitry, and associated wiring of a CRT can be captured remotely and used to reconstruct what is shown on the CRT using a process called [[Van Eck phreaking]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf|title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk?|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> Special [[TEMPEST]] shielding can mitigate this effect.

The right-angles between crystal faces are due to the cubic symmetry of the atoms' arrangement.}}\n{{Main article|Crystal structure}}\nThe scientific definition of a \"crystal\" is based on the microscopic arrangement of atoms inside it, called the [[crystal structure]]. A crystal is a solid where the atoms form a periodic arrangement. ([[Quasicrystal]]s are an exception, see [[#Quasicrystals|below]].)\n\nNot all solids are crystals. For example, when liquid water starts freezing, the phase change begins with small ice crystals that grow until they fuse, forming a ''[[polycrystalline]]'' structure. In the final block of ice, each of the small crystals (called \"[[crystallite]]s\" or \"grains\") is a true crystal with a periodic arrangement of atoms, but the whole polycrystal does ''not'' have a periodic arrangement of atoms, because the periodic pattern is broken at the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]]. Most macroscopic [[inorganic]] solids are polycrystalline, including almost all [[metal]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[ice]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], etc. Solids that are neither crystalline nor polycrystalline, such as [[glass]], are called ''[[amorphous solid]]s'', also called [[glass]]y, vitreous, or noncrystalline. These have no periodic order, even microscopically. There are distinct differences between crystalline solids and amorphous solids: most notably, the process of forming a glass does not release the [[latent heat of fusion]], but forming a crystal does.\n\nA crystal structure (an arrangement of atoms in a crystal) is characterized by its ''unit cell'', a small imaginary box containing one or more atoms in a specific spatial arrangement. The unit cells are [[honeycomb (geometry)|stacked]] in three-dimensional space to form the crystal.\n\nThe [[crystal structure|symmetry of a crystal]] is constrained by the requirement that the unit cells stack perfectly with no gaps. There are 219 possible crystal symmetries, called [[Space group|crystallographic space groups]]. These are grouped into 7 [[crystal system]]s, such as [[cubic crystal system]] (where the crystals may form cubes or rectangular boxes, such as [[halite]] shown at right) or [[hexagonal crystal system]] (where the crystals may form hexagons, such as [[Ice Ih|ordinary water ice]]).\n\n== Crystal faces and shapes ==\n[[File:Crystal facet formation.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|As a [[halite]] crystal is growing, new atoms can very easily attach to the parts of the surface with rough atomic-scale structure and many [[dangling bonds]]. Therefore, these parts of the crystal grow out very quickly (yellow arrows). Eventually, the whole surface consists of smooth, [[surface energy|stable]] faces, where new atoms cannot as easily attach themselves.]]\nCrystals are commonly recognized by their shape, consisting of flat faces with sharp angles. These shape characteristics are not ''necessary'' for a crystal\u2014a crystal is scientifically defined by its microscopic atomic arrangement, not its macroscopic shape\u2014but the characteristic macroscopic shape is often present and easy to see.\n\n[[Euhedral]] crystals are those with obvious, well-formed flat faces. [[Anhedral (petrology)|Anhedral]] crystals do not, usually because the crystal is one grain in a polycrystalline solid.\n\nThe flat faces (also called [[facet]]s) of a [[euhedral]] crystal are oriented in a specific way relative to the underlying [[crystal structure|atomic arrangement of the crystal]]: they are [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] of relatively low [[Miller index]].<ref>''The surface science of metal oxides'', by Victor E. Henrich, P. A. Cox, page 28, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X6x1MmPisKkC&pg=PA2 google books link]</ref> This occurs because some surface orientations are more stable than others (lower [[surface energy]]). As a crystal grows, new atoms attach easily to the rougher and less stable parts of the surface, but less easily to the flat, stable surfaces. Therefore, the flat surfaces tend to grow larger and smoother, until the whole crystal surface consists of these plane surfaces. (See diagram on right.)\n\nOne of the oldest techniques in the science of [[crystallography]] consists of measuring the three-dimensional orientations of the faces of a crystal, and using them to infer the underlying [[crystal system|crystal symmetry]].\n\nA [[Crystal habit|crystal's habit]] is its visible external shape. This is determined by the [[crystal structure]] (which restricts the possible facet orientations), the specific crystal chemistry and bonding (which may favor some facet types over others), and the conditions under which the crystal formed.\n\n== Occurrence in nature ==\n[[File:Ice crystals.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ice]] crystals]]\n[[File:CalciteEchinosphaerites.jpg|thumb|[[Fossil]] [[Animal shell|shell]] with [[calcite]] crystals]]\n\n=== Rocks ===\nBy volume and weight, the largest concentrations of crystals in the Earth are part of its solid [[bedrock]]. Crystals found in rocks typically range in size from a fraction of a millimetre to several centimetres across, although exceptionally large crystals are occasionally found.  {{As of|1999}}, the world's largest known naturally occurring crystal is a crystal of [[beryl]] from Malakialina, [[Madagascar]], {{convert|18|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} in diameter, and weighing {{convert|380,000|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>G. Cressey and I. F. Mercer, (1999) ''Crystals'', London, Natural History Museum, page 58</ref>\n\nSome crystals have formed by [[magmatic]] and [[metamorphic]] processes, giving origin to large masses of crystalline [[rock (geology)|rock]]. The vast majority of [[igneous rocks]] are formed from molten magma and the degree of crystallization depends primarily on the conditions under which they solidified. Such rocks as [[granite]], which have cooled very slowly and under great pressures, have completely crystallized; but many kinds of [[lava]] were poured out at the surface and cooled very rapidly, and in this latter group a small amount of amorphous or [[glass]]y matter is common. Other crystalline rocks, the metamorphic rocks such as [[marble]]s, [[mica-schist]]s and [[quartzite]]s, are recrystallized. This means that they were at first fragmental rocks like [[limestone]], [[shale]] and [[sandstone]] and have never been in a [[molten]] condition nor entirely in solution, but the high temperature and pressure conditions of [[metamorphism]] have acted on them by erasing their original structures and inducing recrystallization in the solid state.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Petrology |volume=21 |first=John Smith |last=Flett|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nOther rock crystals have formed out of precipitation from fluids, commonly water, to form [[druse (geology)|druses]] or [[quartz]] veins.\nThe [[evaporite]]s such as [[halite]], [[gypsum]] and some limestones have been deposited from aqueous solution, mostly owing to [[evaporation]] in arid climates.\n\n=== Ice ===\nWater-based [[ice]] in the form of [[snow]], [[sea ice]] and [[glacier]]s is a very common manifestation of crystalline or polycrystalline matter on Earth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} A single [[snowflake]] is a single crystal or a collection of crystals,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jY9ADAAAQBAJ&pg=PA12&dq=snowflake+is+usually+single+crystal#v=onepage&q=snowflake%20is%20usually%20single%20crystal&f=false|title=The Snowflake: Winter's Frozen Artistry|last=Libbrecht|first=Kenneth|last2=Wing|first2=Rachel|date=2015-09-01|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=9781627887335|language=en}}</ref> while an [[ice cube]] is a [[polycrystal]].\n\n=== Organigenic crystals ===\nMany living [[organisms]] are able to produce crystals, for example [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]] in the case of most [[mollusc]]s or [[hydroxylapatite]] in the case of [[vertebrate]]s.\n\n== Polymorphism and allotropy ==\n{{Main article|Polymorphism (materials science)|Allotropy}}\nThe same group of atoms can often solidify in many different ways. [[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]] is the ability of a solid to exist in more than one crystal form. For example, water [[ice]] is ordinarily found in the hexagonal form [[Ice Ih|Ice I<sub>h</sub>]], but can also exist as the cubic [[ice Ic|Ice I<sub>c</sub>]], the [[rhombohedral]] [[ice II]], and many other forms. The different polymorphs are usually called different ''[[Phase (matter)|phases]]''.\n\nIn addition, the same atoms may be able to form noncrystalline [[Phase (matter)|phases]]. For example, water can also form [[amorphous ice]], while SiO<sub>2</sub> can form both [[fused silica]] (an amorphous glass) and [[quartz]] (a crystal). Likewise, if a substance can form crystals, it can also form polycrystals.\n\nFor pure chemical elements, polymorphism is known as [[allotropy]]. For example, [[diamond]] and [[graphite]] are two crystalline forms of [[carbon]], while [[amorphous carbon]] is a noncrystalline form. Polymorphs, despite having the same atoms, may have wildly different properties. For example, diamond is among the hardest substances known, while graphite is so soft that it is used as a lubricant.\n\n[[Polyamorphism]] is a similar phenomenon where the same atoms can exist in more than one [[amorphous solid]] form.\n\n== Crystallization ==\n{{Main article|Crystallization|Crystal growth}}\n[[File:1-cooling-crystallizer-schladen.JPG|thumb|upright|Vertical [[Crystallization|cooling crystallizer]] in a beet sugar factory.]]\nCrystallization is the process of forming a crystalline structure from a fluid or from materials dissolved in a fluid. (More rarely, crystals may be [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposited]] directly from gas; see [[thin-film deposition]] and [[epitaxy]].)\n\nCrystallization is a complex and extensively-studied field, because depending on the conditions, a single fluid can solidify into many different possible forms. It can form a [[single crystal]], perhaps with various possible [[phase (matter)|phases]], [[stoichiometry|stoichiometries]], impurities, [[Crystallographic defect|defects]], and [[crystal habit|habits]]. Or, it can form a [[polycrystal]], with various possibilities for the size, arrangement, orientation, and phase of its grains. The final form of the solid is determined by the conditions under which the fluid is being solidified, such as the chemistry of the fluid, the [[ambient pressure]], the [[temperature]], and the speed with which all these parameters are changing.\n\nSpecific industrial techniques to produce large single crystals (called ''[[boule (crystal)|boules]]'') include the [[Czochralski process]] and the [[Bridgman technique]]. Other less exotic methods of crystallization may be used, depending on the physical properties of the substance, including [[hydrothermal synthesis]], [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], or simply [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|solvent-based crystallization]].\n\nLarge single crystals can be created by geological processes. For example, [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]] crystals in excess of 10 [[meter]]s are found in the [[Cave of the Crystals]] in Naica, Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/crystal-giants/shea-text|title=Cave of Crystal Giants \u2014 National Geographic Magazine|work=nationalgeographic.com}}</ref> For more details on geological crystal formation, see [[#Rocks|above]].\n\nCrystals can also be formed by biological processes, see [[#Organigenic crystals|above]]. Conversely, some organisms have special techniques to ''prevent'' crystallization from occurring, such as [[antifreeze protein]]s.\n\n== Defects, impurities, and twinning ==\n{{Main article|Crystallographic defect|Impurity|Crystal twinning|Mosaicity}}\n[[File:Vector de Burgers.PNG|upright|thumb|left|Two types of crystallographic defects. <u>Top right:</u> [[edge dislocation]]. <u>Bottom right:</u> [[screw dislocation]].]]\nAn ''ideal'' crystal has every atom in a perfect, exactly repeating pattern.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9fRt0TTYUTgC&q=%22ideal+crystal%22+has+every+atom+in+a+perfect,+exactly+repeating+pattern&dq=%22ideal+crystal%22+has+every+atom+in+a+perfect,+exactly+repeating+pattern|title=Report of the Council|last=Britain)|first=Science Research Council (Great|date=1972|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|language=en}}</ref> However, in reality, most crystalline materials have a variety of [[crystallographic defect]]s, places where the crystal's pattern is interrupted. The types and structures of these defects may have a profound effect on the properties of the materials.\n\nA few examples of crystallographic defects include [[vacancy defect]]s (an empty space where an atom should fit), [[interstitial defect]]s (an extra atom squeezed in where it does not fit), and [[dislocation]]s (see figure at right). Dislocations are especially important in [[materials science]], because they help determine the [[Strength of materials|mechanical strength of materials]].\n\nAnother common type of crystallographic defect is an [[impurity]], meaning that the \"wrong\" type of atom is present in a crystal. For example, a perfect crystal of [[diamond]] would only contain [[carbon]] atoms, but a real crystal might perhaps contain a few [[boron]] atoms as well. These boron impurities change the [[diamond color|diamond's color]] to slightly blue. Likewise, the only difference between [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]] is the type of impurities present in a [[corundum]] crystal.\n\n[[File:Pyrite 60608.jpg|thumb|[[Crystal twinning|Twinned]] [[pyrite]] crystal group.]]\nIn [[semiconductor]]s, a special type of impurity, called a [[dopant]], drastically changes the crystal's electrical properties. [[Semiconductor device]]s, such as [[transistor]]s, are made possible largely by putting different semiconductor dopants into different places, in specific patterns.\n\n[[Crystal twinning|Twinning]] is a phenomenon somewhere between a crystallographic defect and a [[grain boundary]]. Like a grain boundary, a twin boundary has different crystal orientations on its two sides. But unlike a grain boundary, the orientations are not random, but related in a specific, mirror-image way.\n\n[[Mosaicity]] is a spread of crystal plane orientations. A [[mosaicity|mosaic crystal]] is supposed to consist of smaller crystalline units that are somewhat misaligned with respect to each other.\n\n== Chemical bonds ==\nIn general, solids can be held together by various types of [[chemical bond]]s, such as [[metallic bond]]s, [[ionic bond]]s, [[covalent bond]]s, [[van der Waals bond]]s, and others. None of these are necessarily crystalline or non-crystalline. However, there are some general trends as follows.\n\n[[Metal]]s are almost always polycrystalline, though there are exceptions like [[amorphous metal]] and single-crystal metals. The latter are grown synthetically. (A microscopically-small piece of metal may naturally form into a single crystal, but larger pieces generally do not.) [[Ionic compound]] materials are usually crystalline or polycrystalline. In practice, large [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] crystals can be created by solidification of a [[molten]] fluid, or by crystallization out of a solution. [[Covalent bond|Covalently bonded]] solids (sometimes called [[Network covalent bonding|covalent network solids]]) are also very common, notable examples being [[diamond]] and [[quartz]]. Weak [[van der Waals force]]s also help hold together certain crystals, such as crystalline [[molecular solid]]s, as well as the interlayer bonding in [[graphite]]. [[Polymer]] materials generally will form crystalline regions, but the lengths of the molecules usually prevent complete crystallization\u2014and sometimes polymers are completely amorphous.\n\n== Quasicrystals ==\n[[File:Ho-Mg-ZnQuasicrystal.jpg|thumb|The material [[Holmium\u2013magnesium\u2013zinc quasicrystal|holmium\u2013magnesium\u2013zinc]] (Ho\u2013Mg\u2013Zn) forms [[quasicrystal]]s, which can take on the macroscopic shape of a [[dodecahedron]]. (Only a quasicrystal, not a normal crystal, can take this shape.) The edges are 2&nbsp;mm long.]]\n{{Main article|Quasicrystal}}\nA [[quasicrystal]] consists of arrays of atoms that are ordered but not strictly periodic. They have many attributes in common with ordinary crystals, such as displaying a discrete pattern in [[x-ray diffraction]], and the ability to form shapes with smooth, flat faces.\n\nQuasicrystals are most famous for their ability to show five-fold symmetry, which is impossible for an ordinary periodic crystal (see [[crystallographic restriction theorem]]).\n\nThe [[International Union of Crystallography]] has redefined the term \"crystal\" to include both ordinary periodic crystals and quasicrystals (\"any solid having an essentially discrete [[diffraction]] diagram\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=International Union of Crystallography |year=1992 |title=Report of the Executive Committee for 1991 |journal=Acta Crystallogr.

Only about 100 solids are known to form quasicrystals, compared to about 400,000 periodic crystals known in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Steurer W.|journal= Z.

These properties are related to the [[anisotropy]] of the crystal, i.e. the lack of rotational symmetry in its atomic arrangement. One such property is the [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric effect]], where a voltage across the crystal can shrink or stretch it. Another is [[birefringence]], where a double image appears when looking through a crystal. Moreover, various properties of a crystal, including [[electrical conductivity]], [[electrical permittivity]], and [[Young's modulus]], may be different in different directions in a crystal. For example, [[graphite]] crystals consist of a stack of sheets, and although each individual sheet is mechanically very strong, the sheets are rather loosely bound to each other. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the material is quite different depending on the direction of stress.\n\nNot all crystals have all of these properties. Conversely, these properties are not quite exclusive to crystals. They can appear in [[glass]]es or [[polycrystal]]s that have been made [[anisotropic]] by [[Work hardening|working]] or [[stress (mechanics)|stress]]\u2014for example, [[photoelasticity|stress-induced birefringence]].\n\n== Crystallography ==\n{{Main article|Crystallography}}\n''[[Crystallography]]'' is the science of measuring the [[crystal structure]] (in other words, the atomic arrangement) of a crystal. One widely used crystallography technique is [[X-ray diffraction]]. Large numbers of known crystal structures are stored in [[crystallographic database]]s.\n\n== Image gallery ==\n<gallery heights=200 widths=200>\nFile:Insulincrystals.jpg|[[Insulin]] crystals [[space manufacturing|grown in earth orbit]].\nFile:Hoar frost macro2.jpg|[[Hoar frost]]: A type of ice crystal (picture taken from a distance of about 5&nbsp;cm).\nFile:Gallium1 640x480.jpg|[[Gallium]], a metal that easily forms large crystals.\nFile:Apatite-Rhodochrosite-Fluorite-169799.jpg|An apatite crystal sits front and center on cherry-red rhodochroite rhombs, purple fluorite cubes, quartz and a dusting of brass-yellow pyrite cubes.\nFile:Monokristalines Silizium f\u00fcr die Waferherstellung.jpg|[[Boule (crystal)|Boules]] of [[silicon]], like this one, are an important type of industrially-produced [[single crystal]].\nFile:Bornite-Chalcopyrite-Pyrite-180794.jpg|A specimen consisting of a bornite-coated chalcopyrite crystal nestled in a bed of clear quartz crystals and lustrous pyrite crystals.

It uses methods of [[theoretical chemistry]], incorporated into efficient [[computer program]]s, to calculate the structures and properties of [[molecule]]s and solids. It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion ([[dihydrogen cation]], see references therein for more details), the quantum [[many-body problem]] cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form.  While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical [[experiment]]s, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical [[phenomena]]. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials.\n\nExamples of such properties are structure (i.e., the expected positions of the constituent atoms), absolute and [[interaction energy|relative]] (interaction) [[energy|energies]], [[electron]]ic [[charge density]] distributions, [[dipole]]s and higher [[multipole moment]]s, [[vibrational spectroscopy|vibrational frequencies]], [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], or other [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] quantities, and [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]] for [[scattering theory|collision]] with other particles.\n\nThe methods used cover both static and dynamic situations. In all cases, the computer time and other resources (such as memory and disk space) increase rapidly with the size of the system being studied.  That system can be one molecule, a group of molecules, or a solid.  Computational chemistry methods range from very approximate to highly accurate; the latter are usually feasible for small systems only. [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''Ab initio'' methods]] are based entirely on [[quantum mechanics]] and basic [[physical constant]]s. Other methods are called empirical or [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry method|semi-empirical]] because they use additional empirical parameters.\n\nBoth ''[[ab initio]]'' and semi-empirical approaches involve approximations.  These range from simplified forms of the first-principles equations that are easier or faster to solve, to approximations limiting the size of the system (for example, [[periodic boundary conditions]]), to fundamental approximations to the underlying equations that are required to achieve any solution to them at all.  For example, most ''ab initio'' calculations make the [[Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation]], which greatly simplifies the underlying [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] by assuming that the nuclei remain in place during the calculation.  In principle, [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' methods]] eventually converge to the exact solution of the underlying equations as the number of approximations is reduced.  In practice, however, it is impossible to eliminate all approximations, and residual error inevitably remains.  The goal of computational chemistry is to minimize this residual error while keeping the calculations tractable.\n\nIn some cases, the details of electronic structure are less important than the long-time [[phase space]] behavior of molecules. This is the case in conformational studies of proteins and protein-ligand binding thermodynamics. Classical approximations to the [[potential energy surface]] are used, as they are computationally less intensive than electronic calculations, to enable longer simulations of [[molecular dynamics]]. Furthermore, [[cheminformatics]] uses even more empirical (and computationally cheaper) methods like [[machine learning]] based on physicochemical properties. One typical problem in cheminformatics is to predict the binding affinity of drug molecules to a given target.\n\n== History ==\nBuilding on the founding discoveries and theories in the [[history of quantum mechanics]], the first theoretical calculations in chemistry were those of [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]] in 1927. The books that were influential in the early development of computational quantum chemistry include [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Edgar Bright Wilson|E. Bright Wilson]]'s 1935 ''Introduction to Quantum Mechanics \u2013 with Applications to Chemistry'', [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Eyring]], Walter and Kimball's 1944 ''Quantum Chemistry'', Heitler's 1945 ''Elementary Wave Mechanics \u2013 with Applications to Quantum Chemistry'', and later [[Charles Coulson|Coulson]]'s 1952 textbook ''Valence'', each of which served as primary references for chemists in the decades to follow.\n\nWith the development of efficient [[computer]] technology in the 1940s, the solutions of elaborate [[wave equation]]s for complex [[atom]]ic systems began to be a realizable objective.  In the early 1950s, the first semi-empirical atomic orbital calculations were performed. Theoretical chemists became extensive users of the early digital computers. One major advance came with the 1951 paper in Reviews of Modern Physics by Clemens C. J. Roothaan in 1951, largely on the \"LCAO MO\" approach (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals Molecular Orbitals), for many years the second-most cited paper in that journal.

In theoretical chemistry, chemists, physicists, and mathematicians develop [[algorithm]]s and computer programs to predict atomic and molecular properties and reaction paths for [[chemical reaction]]s. Computational chemists, in contrast, may simply apply existing computer programs and methodologies to specific chemical questions.\n\nComputational chemistry has two different aspects:\n* Computational studies, used to find a starting point for a laboratory synthesis, or to assist in understanding experimental data, such as the position and source of spectroscopic peaks.\n* Computational studies, used to predict the possibility of so far entirely unknown molecules or to explore reaction mechanisms not readily studied via experiments.\n\nThus, computational chemistry can assist the experimental chemist or it can challenge the experimental chemist to find entirely new chemical objects.\n\nSeveral major areas may be distinguished within computational chemistry:\n* The prediction of the molecular structure of molecules by the use of the simulation of forces, or more accurate quantum chemical methods, to find stationary points on the energy surface as the position of the nuclei is varied.\n* Storing and searching for data on chemical entities (see [[chemical database]]s).\n* Identifying [[correlation]]s between [[chemical structure]]s and properties (see ''quantitative structure\u2013property relationship'' (QSPR) and ''[[quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship]]'' (QSAR)).\n* Computational approaches to help in the efficient synthesis of compounds.\n* Computational approaches to design molecules that interact in specific ways with other molecules (e.g. [[drug design]] and [[catalysis]]).\n\n== Accuracy ==\nThe words ''exact'' and ''perfect'' do not apply here, as very few aspects of chemistry can be computed exactly. However, almost every aspect of chemistry can be described in a qualitative or approximate quantitative computational scheme.\n\nMolecules consist of nuclei and electrons, so the methods of [[quantum mechanics]] apply. Computational chemists often attempt to solve the non-relativistic [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], with relativistic corrections added, although some progress has been made in solving the fully relativistic [[Dirac equation]]. In principle, it is possible to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in either its time-dependent or time-independent form, as appropriate for the problem in hand; in practice, this is not possible except for very small systems. Therefore, a great number of approximate methods strive to achieve the best trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.\n\nAccuracy can always be improved with greater computational cost. Significant errors can present themselves in [[ab initio]] models comprising many electrons, due to the computational cost of full relativistic-inclusive methods. This complicates the study of molecules interacting with high atomic mass unit atoms, such as transitional metals and their catalytic properties. Present algorithms in computational chemistry can routinely calculate the properties of small molecules that contain up to about 40 electrons with errors for energies less than a few kJ/mol. For geometries, bond lengths can be predicted within a few picometres and bond angles within 0.5 degrees. The treatment of larger molecules that contain a few dozen atoms is computationally tractable by more approximate methods such as [[density functional theory]] (DFT).\n\nThere is some dispute within the field whether or not the latter methods are sufficient to describe complex chemical reactions, such as those in biochemistry. Large molecules can be studied by semi-empirical approximate methods. Even larger molecules are treated by [[classical mechanics]] methods that use what are called [[molecular mechanics]] (MM).  In QM-MM methods, small parts of large complexes are treated quantum mechanically (QM), and the remainder is treated approximately (MM).\n\n== Methods ==\nOne molecular formula can represent more than one molecular isomer: a set of isomers. Each isomer is a local minimum on the energy surface (called the [[potential energy surface]]) created from the total energy (i.e., the electronic energy, plus the repulsion energy between the nuclei) as a function of the coordinates of all the nuclei. A stationary point is a geometry such that the derivative of the energy with respect to all displacements of the nuclei is zero. A local (energy) minimum is a stationary point where all such displacements lead to an increase in energy. The local minimum that is lowest is called the global minimum and corresponds to the most stable isomer. If there is one particular coordinate change that leads to a decrease in the total energy in both directions, the stationary point is a [[Transition state|transition structure]] and the coordinate is the [[reaction coordinate]]. This process of determining stationary points is called [[geometry optimization]].\n\nThe determination of molecular structure by [[geometry optimization]] became routine only after efficient methods for calculating the first derivatives of the energy with respect to all atomic coordinates became available. Evaluation of the related second derivatives allows the prediction of vibrational frequencies if harmonic motion is estimated. More importantly, it allows for the characterization of stationary points. The frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the [[Hessian matrix]], which contains second derivatives. If the eigenvalues are all positive, then the frequencies are all real and the stationary point is a local minimum. If one eigenvalue is negative (i.e., an imaginary frequency), then the stationary point is a transition structure. If more than one eigenvalue is negative, then the stationary point is a more complex one, and is usually of little interest. When one of these is found, it is necessary to move the search away from it if the experimenter is looking solely for local minima and transition structures.\n\nThe total energy is determined by approximate solutions of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, usually with no relativistic terms included, and by making use of the [[Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation]], which allows for the separation of electronic and nuclear motions, thereby simplifying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. This leads to the evaluation of the total energy as a sum of the electronic energy at fixed nuclei positions and the repulsion energy of the nuclei. A notable exception are certain approaches called [[direct quantum chemistry]], which treat electrons and nuclei on a common footing. Density functional methods and semi-empirical methods are variants on the major theme. For very large systems, the relative total energies can be compared using molecular mechanics. The ways of determining the total energy to predict molecular structures are:\n\n=== ''Ab initio'' methods ===\n{{Main article|Ab initio quantum chemistry methods}}\n\nThe programs used in computational chemistry are based on many different [[quantum chemistry|quantum-chemical]] methods that solve the molecular [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] associated with the [[molecular Hamiltonian]]. Methods that do not include any empirical or semi-empirical parameters in their equations&nbsp;\u2013 being derived directly from theoretical principles, with no inclusion of experimental data&nbsp;\u2013 are called ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]]''. This does not imply that the solution is an exact one; they are all approximate quantum mechanical calculations. It means that a particular approximation is rigorously defined on first principles (quantum theory) and then solved within an error margin that is qualitatively known beforehand. If numerical iterative methods must be used, the aim is to iterate until full machine accuracy is obtained (the best that is possible with a finite [[word length]] on the computer, and within the mathematical and/or physical approximations made).\n\n[[File:Electron correlation.png|thumb|right|300px|Diagram illustrating various ''ab initio'' electronic structure methods in terms of energy. Spacings are not to scale.]]\n\nThe simplest type of ''ab initio'' electronic structure calculation is the [[Hartree\u2013Fock method]] (HF), an extension of [[molecular orbital theory]], in which the correlated electron-electron repulsion is not specifically taken into account; only its average effect is included in the calculation. As the basis set size is increased, the energy and wave function tend towards a limit called the Hartree\u2013Fock limit. Many types of calculations (termed [[post-Hartree\u2013Fock]] methods) begin with a Hartree\u2013Fock calculation and subsequently correct for electron-electron repulsion, referred to also as [[electronic correlation]]. As these methods are pushed to the limit, they approach the exact solution of the non-relativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation. To obtain exact agreement with experiment, it is necessary to include relativistic and [[Angular momentum coupling#Spin-orbit coupling|spin orbit]] terms, both of which are far more important for heavy atoms. In all of these approaches, along with choice of method, it is necessary to choose a [[basis set (chemistry)|basis set]]. This is a set of functions, usually centered on the different atoms in the molecule, which are used to expand the molecular orbitals with the [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO) molecular orbital method [[ansatz]]. Ab initio methods need to define a level of theory (the method) and a basis set.\n\nThe Hartree\u2013Fock wave function is a single configuration or determinant. In some cases, particularly for bond breaking processes, this is inadequate, and several [[Multi-configurational self-consistent field|configurations]] must be used. Here, the coefficients of the configurations, and of the basis functions, are optimized together.\n\nThe total molecular energy can be evaluated as a function of the [[molecular geometry]]; in other words, the [[potential energy surface]]. Such a surface can be used for reaction dynamics. The stationary points of the surface lead to predictions of different [[isomer]]s and the [[Transition state theory|transition structures]] for conversion between isomers, but these can be determined without a full knowledge of the complete surface.\n\nA particularly important objective, called computational [[thermochemistry]], is to calculate thermochemical quantities such as the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|enthalpy of formation]] to chemical accuracy. Chemical accuracy is the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is generally considered to be 1&nbsp;kcal/mol or 4&nbsp;kJ/mol. To reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post-Hartree\u2013Fock methods and combine the results. These methods are called [[quantum chemistry composite methods]].\n\n=== Density functional methods ===\n{{Main article|Density functional theory}}\n\nDensity functional theory (DFT) methods are often considered to be ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]]'' for determining the molecular electronic structure, even though many of the most common [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]] use parameters derived from empirical data, or from more complex calculations. In DFT, the total energy is expressed in terms of the total one-[[electronic density|electron density]] rather than the wave function. In this type of calculation, there is an approximate [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] and an approximate expression for the total electron density. DFT methods can be very accurate for little computational cost. Some methods combine the density functional exchange functional with the Hartree\u2013Fock exchange term and are termed [[hybrid functional]] methods.\n\n=== Semi-empirical methods ===\n{{Main article|Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods}}\n\nSemi-empirical [[quantum chemistry]] methods are based on the [[Hartree\u2013Fock method]] formalism, but make many approximations and obtain some parameters from empirical data. They were very important in computational chemistry from the 60s to the 90s, especially for treating large molecules where the full Hartree\u2013Fock method without the approximations were too costly. The use of empirical parameters appears to allow some inclusion of correlation effects into the methods.\n\nPrimitive semi-empirical methods were designed even before, where the two-electron part of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is not explicitly included. For \u03c0-electron systems, this was the [[H\u00fcckel method]] proposed by [[Erich H\u00fcckel]], and for all valence electron systems, the [[extended H\u00fcckel method]] proposed by [[Roald Hoffmann]]. Sometimes, H\u00fcckel methods are referred to as \"completely emprirical\" because they do not derive from a Hamiltonian.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Counts|first=Richard W.|date=1987-07-01|title=Strategies I|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01676961|journal=Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=177\u2013178|doi=10.1007/bf01676961|issn=0920-654X|bibcode=1987JCAMD...1..177C}}</ref>Yet, the term \"empirical methods\", or \"empirical force fields\" is usually used to describe Molecular Mechanics.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470125793.ch4/summary|title=Reviews in Computational Chemistry|last=Dinur|first=Uri|last2=Hagler|first2=Arnold T.|date=1991|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780470125793|editor-last=Lipkowitz|editor-first=Kenny B.|pages=99\u2013164|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470125793.ch4|editor-last2=Boyd|editor-first2=Donald B.}}</ref>\n\n=== Molecular mechanics ===\n{{Main article|Molecular mechanics}}\n\nIn many cases, large molecular systems can be modeled successfully while avoiding quantum mechanical calculations entirely. [[Molecular mechanics]] simulations, for example, use one classical expression for the energy of a compound, for instance the [[harmonic oscillator]]. All constants appearing in the equations must be obtained beforehand from experimental data or ''ab initio'' calculations.\n\nThe database of compounds used for parameterization, i.e., the resulting set of parameters and functions is called the [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]], is crucial to the success of molecular mechanics calculations. A force field parameterized against a specific class of molecules, for instance proteins, would be expected to only have any relevance when describing other molecules of the same class.\n\nThese methods can be applied to proteins and other large biological molecules, and allow studies of the approach and interaction (docking) of potential drug molecules.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.bio-balance.com/JMGM_article.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jmgm.2006.02.008|pmid=16574446|title=Molecular dynamics of a biophysical model for \u03b22-adrenergic and G protein-coupled receptor activation|journal=Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling|volume=25|issue=4|pages=396|year=2006|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Lester A.|last2=Zauhar|first2=Randy J.|last3=Lanzara|first3=Richard G.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.bio-balance.com/GPCR_Activation.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0166-1280(98)90217-2|title=Activation of G protein-coupled receptors entails cysteine modulation of agonist binding|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure: THEOCHEM|volume=430|pages=57|year=1998|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Lester A.|last2=Lanzara|first2=Richard G.}}</ref>\n\n=== Methods for solids ===\n{{Main article|Computational chemical methods in solid state physics}}\n\nComputational chemical methods can be applied to [[solid state physics]] problems. The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a [[band structure]], which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the [[Brillouin zone]]. Ab initio and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies; therefore, they can be applied to band structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, it is even more time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.\n\n=== Chemical dynamics ===\nOnce the electronic and [[molecular geometry|nuclear]] variables are [[separation of variables|separated]] (within the Born\u2013Oppenheimer representation), in the time-dependent approach, the [[wave packet]] corresponding to the nuclear [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] is propagated via the [[time evolution]] [[operator (physics)]] associated to the time-dependent [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] (for the full [[molecular Hamiltonian]]). In the [[complementarity (physics)|complementary]] energy-dependent approach, the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is solved using the [[scattering theory]] formalism. The potential representing the interatomic interaction is given by the [[potential energy surface]]s. In general, the [[potential energy surface]]s are coupled via the [[vibronic coupling]] terms.\n\nThe most popular methods for propagating the [[wave packet]] associated to the [[molecular geometry]] are:\n* the [[split operator technique]],\n* the [[Chebyshev polynomials|Chebyshev (real) polynomial]],\n* the [[multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree]] method (MCTDH),\n* the semiclassical method.\n\n=== Molecular dynamics ===\n{{Main article|Molecular dynamics}}\n\nMolecular dynamics (MD) use either [[quantum mechanics]], [[molecular mechanics]] or a [[QM/MM|mixture of both]] to calculate forces which are then used to solve [[Newton's laws of motion]] to examine the time-dependent behaviour of systems. The result of a molecular dynamics simulation is a trajectory that describes how the position and velocity of particles varies with time.\n\n=== Quantum mechanics/Molecular mechanics (QM/MM) ===\n{{Main article|QM/MM}}\nQM/MM is a hybrid method that attempts to combine the accuracy of quantum mechanics with the speed of molecular mechanics. It is useful for simulating very large molecules such as [[enzyme]]s.\n\n== Interpreting molecular wave functions ==\n\nThe [[atoms in molecules]] (QTAIM) model of [[Richard Bader]] was developed to effectively link the quantum mechanical model of a molecule, as an electronic wavefunction, to chemically useful concepts such as atoms in molecules, functional groups, bonding, the theory of [[Lewis pair]]s, and the [[Valence bond theory|valence bond model]]. Bader has demonstrated that these empirically useful chemistry concepts can be related to the [[topology]] of the observable charge density distribution, whether measured or calculated from a quantum mechanical wavefunction. QTAIM analysis of molecular wavefunctions is implemented, for example, in the [[AIMAll]] software package.\n\n== Software packages ==\nMany self-sufficient [[:Category:Computational chemistry software|computational chemistry software packages]] exist. Some include many methods covering a wide range, while others concentrate on a very specific range or even on one method. Details of most of them can be found in:\n* [[Biomolecular]] modelling programs: [[List of protein structure prediction software|proteins]], [[Comparison of nucleic acid simulation software|nucleic acid]].\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling|Molecular mechanics]] programs.\n* [[List of quantum chemistry and solid state physics software|Quantum chemistry and solid state physics software]] supporting several methods.\n* [[Molecular design software]]\n* [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods|Semi-empirical]] programs.\n* [[Valence bond programs]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Chemistry|Physics}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[List of computational chemists]]\n* [[Bioinformatics]]\n* [[Computational biology]]\n* [[Computational Chemistry List]]\n* [[Automatic programming#Implementations|Efficient code generation by computer algebra]]\n* [[Comparison of force field implementations]]\n* [[List of important publications in chemistry#Theoretical chemistry, Quantum chemistry and Computational Chemistry|Important publications in computational chemistry]]\n* [[In silico]]\n* [[International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science]]\n* [[Mathematical chemistry]]\n* [[Molecular graphics]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n* [[Molecular modeling on GPUs]]\n* [[Monte Carlo molecular modeling]]\n* [[Protein dynamics]]\n* [[Scientific computing]]\n* [[Statistical mechanics]]\n* [[Solvent models]]\n<!-- * [[Potential Distribution Theorem]] comment out until not redlink -->\n</div>\n}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* C.

G. Ballard]], first published in 1973. It is a story about [[symphorophilia]]; specifically [[Traffic collision|car-crash]] [[sexual fetishism]]: its protagonists become sexually aroused by staging and participating in real car-crashes.\n\nIt was a highly controversial novel: one [[publisher's reader]] returned the verdict \"This author is beyond psychiatric help. Do Not Publish!\"<ref>[[Lars Svendsen]], ''A Philosophy of Boredom'', trans. John Irons (London: Reaktion Books, 2005), 82.</ref> In 1996, the novel was made into a [[Crash (1996 film)|film of the same name]] by [[David Cronenberg]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe story is told through the eyes of [[narrator]] James Ballard, named after the author himself, but it centers on the sinister figure of Dr. Robert Vaughan, a \"former TV-scientist, turned nightmare angel of the expressways\". Ballard meets Vaughan after being involved in a car accident himself near [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]]. Gathering around Vaughan is a group of alienated people, all of them former crash victims, who follow him in his pursuit to re-enact the crashes of celebrities and experience what the narrator calls \"a new sexuality, born from a perverse technology\". Vaughan's ultimate fantasy is to die in a head-on collision with movie star [[Elizabeth Taylor]].<ref>https://books.google.com/books/about/Crash.html?id=Y8-iHi1IBigC</ref>\n\n==References in popular art==\n\n===Music===\n[[The Normal]]'s 1978 song \"[[Warm Leatherette]]\" was inspired by the novel, as reportedly was the international hit \"Cars\" by [[Gary Numan]] in 1979. \"[[Miss the Girl]],\" a 1983 [[single (music)|single]] by [[The Creatures]], is also inspired by the novel.\nThe [[Manic Street Preachers]]' song \"Mausoleum\" from 1994's ''[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]]'' contains the famous Ballard quote about his reasons for writing the book, \"I wanted to rub the human face in its own vomit. I wanted to force it to look in the mirror.\" <ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/20/jg-ballard-film-music-architecture-tv</ref>\n\n===Other film adaptations===\nAn apparently unauthorized adaptation of Crash called ''Nightmare Angel'' was filmed in 1986 by Susan Emerling and [[Zoe Beloff]]. This short film bears the credit \"Inspired by J.G. Ballard.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Brett|title=The Forgotten Crash: Nightmare Angel|journal=Video Watchdog|date=Oct\u2013Nov 2009|issue=152|pages=12\u201316}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Autassassinophilia]]\n*[http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/21-days-of-andy-warhol/2013/11/andy-warhol-death-disaster-series-prestige.html Andy Warhol Death and Disaster Series]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.jgballard.ca/terminal_collection/1968_73.html The Terminal Collection: JG Ballard First Editions]\n*[http://www.bl.uk/works/crash ''Crash''] at the British Library\n<!--* James Ballard-IMDb-->\n\n{{J.

By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical [[Machine code|machine instructions]], and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in [[assembly language]], including [[operating system]]s, as well as various [[application software]] for computers ranging from [[supercomputer]]s to [[embedded system]]s.\n\nC was originally developed by [[Dennis Ritchie]] between 1969 and 1973 at [[Bell Labs]],<ref name=\"chistory\" /> and used to re-implement the [[Unix]] operating system.<ref name=\"AutoTX-1\" />  It has since become one of the [[Measuring programming language popularity|most widely used programming languages]] of all time,<ref name=\"AutoTX-2\" /><ref name=\"AutoTX-3\" /> with C [[compiler]]s from various vendors available for the majority of existing [[computer architecture]]s and operating systems.  C has been standardized by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) since 1989 (see [[ANSI C]]) and subsequently by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).\n\nC is an [[imperative programming|imperative]] [[procedural programming|procedural]] language.  It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward [[compiler]], to provide [[Low-level programming language|low-level]] access to [[Computer memory|memory]], to provide language constructs that map efficiently to [[Machine code|machine instructions]], and to require minimal [[Runtime system|run-time support]].  Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage [[Cross-platform software|cross-platform]] programming.  A [[Specification (technical standard)|standards]]-compliant C program that is written with [[porting|portability]] in mind can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.  The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded [[microcontroller]]s to [[supercomputer]]s.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Ken n dennis.jpg|thumb|[[Dennis Ritchie]] (right), the inventor of the C programming language, with [[Ken Thompson]]]]\n\nLike most imperative languages in the [[ALGOL]] tradition, C has facilities for [[structured programming]] and allows [[lexical variable scope]] and recursion, while a static [[type system]] prevents many unintended operations.  In C, all [[executable code]] is contained within [[subroutine]]s, which are called \"functions\" (although not in the strict sense of [[functional programming]]). [[Parameter (computer programming)|Function parameters]] are always passed by value. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] values. C program source text is [[free-form language|free-format]], using the [[semicolon]] as a [[Statement (programming)|statement]] terminator and [[curly braces]] for grouping [[blocks of statements]].\n\nThe C language also exhibits the following characteristics:\n\n* There is a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of [[control flow]] primitives: <code>[[For loop|for]]</code>, <code>[[Conditional (computer programming)|if/else]]</code>, <code>[[While loop|while]]</code>, <code>[[Switch statement|switch]]</code>, and <code>[[Do while loop|do/while]]</code>. User-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of [[Sigil (computer programming)|sigil]].\n* There are a large number of arithmetical and logical operators, such as <code>+</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>++</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>~</code>, etc.\n* More than one [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment]] may be performed in a single statement.\n* Function return values can be ignored when not needed.\n* Typing is [[Static typing|static]], but [[Strong and weak typing|weakly enforced]]: all data has a type, but implicit conversions may be performed.\n* [[Declaration (computer programming)|Declaration]] [[C syntax|syntax]] mimics usage context. C has no \"define\" keyword; instead, a statement beginning with the name of a type is taken as a declaration. There is no \"function\" keyword; instead, a function is indicated by the parentheses of an argument list.\n* User-defined (<code>typedef</code>) and compound types are possible.\n** Heterogeneous aggregate data types (<code>[[struct (C programming language)|struct]]</code>) allow related data elements to be accessed and assigned as a unit.\n**[[Union type|Union]] is a structure with overlapping members; only the last member stored is valid.\n** [[Array data type|Array]] indexing is a secondary notation, defined in terms of pointer arithmetic. Unlike structs, arrays are not first-class objects; they cannot be assigned or compared using single built-in operators. There is no \"array\" keyword, in use or definition; instead, square brackets indicate arrays syntactically, for example <code>month[11]</code>.\n** [[Enumerated type]]s are possible with the <code>enum</code> keyword. They are freely interconvertible with integers.\n** [[String (computer science)|Strings]] are not a separate data type, but are conventionally [[C string handling|implemented]] as [[Null-terminated string|null-terminated]] arrays of characters.\n* Low-level access to [[computer memory]] is possible by converting machine addresses to typed [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]].\n* [[Procedure (computer science)|Procedures]] (subroutines not returning values) are a special case of function, with an untyped return type <code>void</code>.\n* Functions may not be defined within the lexical scope of other functions.\n* Function and data pointers permit ''ad hoc'' [[run-time polymorphism]].\n* A [[C preprocessor|preprocessor]] performs [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] definition, [[source code]] file inclusion, and [[conditional compilation]].\n* There is a basic form of [[Modular programming|modularity]]: files can be compiled separately and [[Linker (computing)|linked]] together, with control over which functions and data objects are visible to other files via [[Static (keyword)|<code>static</code>]] and <code>extern</code> attributes.\n* Complex functionality such as [[input/output|I/O]], [[string (computer science)|string]] manipulation, and mathematical functions are consistently delegated to [[library (computing)|library routines]].\n\nWhile C does not include some features found in some other languages, such as [[object-oriented programming|object orientation]] or [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], such features can be implemented or emulated in C, often by way of external libraries (e.g., the [[Boehm garbage collector]] or the [[GObject|GLib Object System]]).\n\n=== Relations to other languages ===\nMany later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], Unix's [[C shell]], [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Limbo (programming language)|Limbo]], [[LPC (programming language)|LPC]], [[Objective-C]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], [[Verilog]] and [[SystemVerilog]] (hardware description languages).<ref name=\"vinsp\" />  These languages have drawn many of their [[control structures]] and other basic features from C.  Most of them (with Python being the most dramatic exception) are also very [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntactically]] similar to C in general, and they tend to combine the recognizable expression and statement [[C syntax|syntax of C]] with underlying type systems, data models, and semantics that can be radically different.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early developments ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"margin-left: 1.5em;\"\n|-\n!

Eventually, they decided to port the operating system to a [[PDP-11]]. The original PDP-11 version of Unix was developed in assembly language. The developers were considering rewriting the system using the [[B (programming language)|B language]], Thompson's simplified version of [[BCPL]].<ref name=\"sigplan\">{{cite journal | first = Dennis M.| last = Ritchie | authorlink = Dennis Ritchie | title = The Development of the C Language | date = March 1993 | journal = ACM SIGPLAN Notices | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 201\u2013208 | url = http://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html | doi = 10.1145/155360.155580 | ref = harv}}</ref> However B's inability to take advantage of some of the PDP-11's features, notably [[byte]] addressability, led to C.

The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as ''K&R C''. The second edition of the book<ref name=\"k&r2e\" /> covers the later [[ANSI C]] standard, described below.\n\nK&R introduced several language features:\n\n* Standard I/O library\n* <code>long int</code> data type\n* <code>unsigned int</code> data type\n* Compound assignment operators of the form <code>=''op''</code> (such as <code>=-</code>) were changed to the form <code>''op''=</code> (that is, <code>-=</code>) to remove the semantic ambiguity created by constructs such as <code>i=-10</code>, which had been interpreted as <code>i&nbsp;=-&nbsp;10</code> (decrement <code>i</code> by 10) instead of the possibly intended <code>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;-10</code> (let <code>i</code> be -10).\n\nEven after the publication of the 1989 ANSI standard, for many years K&R C was still considered the \"[[Lowest common denominator (computers)|lowest common denominator]]\" to which C programmers restricted themselves when maximum portability was desired, since many older compilers were still in use, and because carefully written K&R C code can be legal Standard C as well.\n\nIn early versions of C, only functions that return types other than <code>int</code> must be declared if used before the function definition; functions used without prior declaration were presumed to return type <code>int</code>.\n\nFor example:\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\nlong some_function();\n/* int */ other_function();\n\n/* int */ calling_function()\n{\n    long test1;\n    register /* int */ test2;\n\n    test1 = some_function();\n    if (test1 > 0)\n          test2 = 0;\n    else\n          test2 = other_function();\n    return test2;\n}\n</source>\n\nThe <code>int</code> type specifiers which are commented out could be omitted in K&R C, but are required in later standards.\n\nSince K&R function declarations did not include any information about function arguments, function parameter [[type checking|type checks]] were not performed, although some compilers would issue a warning message if a local function was called with the wrong number of arguments, or if multiple calls to an external function used different numbers or types of arguments.  Separate tools such as Unix's [[lint programming tool|lint]] utility were developed that (among other things) could check for consistency of function use across multiple source files.\n\nIn the years following the publication of K&R C, several features were added to the language, supported by compilers from AT&T (in particular [[Portable C Compiler|PCC]]<ref>{{cite report |first=Bjarne |last=Stroustrup |authorlink=Bjarne Stroustrup |title=Sibling rivalry: C and C++ |publisher=AT&T Labs |number=TD-54MQZY |year=2002 |url=http://stroustrup.com/sibling_rivalry.pdf}}</ref>) and some other vendors. These included:\n\n* <code>[[void type|void]]</code> functions (i.e., functions with no return value)\n* functions returning <code>[[Struct (C programming language)|struct]]</code> or <code>[[union (computer science)|union]]</code> types (rather than pointers)\n* [[assignment (computer science)|assignment]] for <code>struct</code> data types\n* [[enumerated type]]s\n\nThe large number of extensions and lack of agreement on a [[C standard library|standard library]], together with the language popularity and the fact that not even the Unix compilers precisely implemented the K&R specification, led to the necessity of standardization.\n\n=== ANSI C and ISO C ===\n{{Main article|ANSI C}}\n\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:The C Programming Language cover.svg|thumb|240x240px|The cover of the book, ''[[The C Programming Language]]'', second edition by [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]] covering ANSI C]] -->\nDuring the late 1970s and 1980s, versions of C were implemented for a wide variety of [[mainframe computer]]s, [[minicomputer]]s, and [[microcomputer]]s, including the [[IBM PC]], as its popularity began to increase significantly.\n\nIn 1983, the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. X3J11 based the C standard on the Unix implementation; however, the non-portable portion of the Unix C library was handed off to the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[working group]] 1003 to become the basis for the 1988 [[POSIX]] standard. In 1989, the C standard was ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 \"Programming Language C\".  This version of the language is often referred to as [[ANSI C]], Standard C, or sometimes C89.\n\nIn 1990, the ANSI C standard (with formatting changes) was adopted by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, which is sometimes called C90. Therefore, the terms \"C89\" and \"C90\" refer to the same programming language.\n\nANSI, like other national standards bodies, no longer develops the C standard independently, but defers to the international C standard, maintained by the working group [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22]]/WG14.  National adoption of an update to the international standard typically occurs within a year of ISO publication.\n\nOne of the aims of the C standardization process was to produce a [[superset]] of K&R C, incorporating many of the subsequently introduced unofficial features. The standards committee also included several additional features such as [[function prototype]]s (borrowed from C++), <code>void</code> pointers, support for international [[character encoding|character sets]] and [[Locale (computer software)|locales]], and preprocessor enhancements. Although the [[C syntax|syntax]] for parameter declarations was augmented to include the style used in C++, the K&R interface continued to be permitted, for compatibility with existing source code.\n\nC89 is supported by current C compilers, and most C code being written today is based on it. Any program written only in Standard C and without any hardware-dependent assumptions will run correctly on any [[Computing platform|platform]] with a conforming C implementation, within its resource limits.  Without such precautions, programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] libraries, or to a reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of data types and byte [[endianness]].\n\nIn cases where code must be compilable by either standard-conforming or K&R C-based compilers, the <code>__STDC__</code> macro can be used to split the code into Standard and K&R sections to prevent the use on a K&R C-based compiler of features available only in Standard C.\n\nAfter the ANSI/ISO standardization process, the C language specification remained relatively static for several years. In 1995, Normative Amendment 1 to the 1990 C standard (ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, known informally as C95) was published, to correct some details and to add more extensive support for international character sets.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=C Integrity |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/23909.html |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |date=1995-03-30}}</ref>\n\n=== C99 ===\n{{Main article|C99}}\n\nThe C standard was further revised in the late 1990s, leading to the publication of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 in 1999, which is commonly referred to as \"[[C99]]\". It has since been amended three times by Technical Corrigenda.<ref name=\"AutoTX-5\" />\n\nC99 introduced several new features, including [[inline function]]s, several new [[data type]]s (including <code>long long int</code> and a <code>complex</code> type to represent [[complex number]]s), [[variable-length array]]s and [[flexible array member]]s, improved support for [[IEEE 754]] floating point, support for [[variadic macro]]s (macros of variable [[arity]]), and support for one-line comments beginning with <code>//</code>, as in [[BCPL]] or C++. Many of these had already been implemented as extensions in several C compilers.\n\nC99 is for the most part backward compatible with C90, but is stricter in some ways; in particular, a declaration that lacks a type specifier no longer has <code>int</code> implicitly assumed. A standard macro <code>__STDC_VERSION__</code> is defined with value <code>199901L</code> to indicate that C99 support is available. [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], [[Sun Studio (software)|Solaris Studio]], and other C compilers now support many or all of the new features of C99. The C compiler in [[Microsoft Visual C++]], however, implements the C89 standard and those parts of C99 that are required for compatibility with [[C++11]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/interview-with-herb-sutter/231900562 |title=Interview with Herb Sutter |website=[[Dr. Dobbs]] |author=Andrew Binstock |date=October 12, 2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== C11 ===\n{{Main article|C11 (C standard revision)}}\n\nIn 2007, work began on another revision of the C standard, informally called \"C1X\" until its official publication on 2011-12-08. The C standards committee adopted guidelines to limit the adoption of new features that had not been tested by existing implementations.\n\nThe C11 standard adds numerous new features to C and the library, including type generic macros, anonymous structures, improved Unicode support, atomic operations, multi-threading, and bounds-checked functions.  It also makes some portions of the existing C99 library optional, and improves compatibility with C++. The standard macro <code>__STDC_VERSION__</code> is defined as <code>201112L</code> to indicate that C11 support is available.\n\n=== C18 ===\n{{Main article|C18 (C standard revision)}}\n\nPublished in June 2018, C18 is the current standard for the C programming language. It introduces no new language features, only technical corrections and clarifications to defects in C11. The standard macro <code>__STDC_VERSION__</code> is defined as <code>201710L</code>.\n\n=== Embedded C ===\n{{Main article|Embedded C}}\n\nHistorically, embedded C programming requires nonstandard extensions to the C language in order to support exotic features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations.\n\nIn 2008, the C Standards Committee published a [[technical report]] extending the C language<ref name=\"AutoTX-6\" /> to address these issues by providing a common standard for all implementations to adhere to. It includes a number of features not available in normal C, such as [[fixed-point arithmetic]], named address spaces, and basic I/O hardware addressing.\n\n== Syntax ==\n{{Main article|C syntax}}\n\nC has a [[formal grammar]] specified by the C standard.<ref name=\"h&s5e\" /> Line endings are generally not significant in C; however, line boundaries do have significance during the preprocessing phase. Comments may appear either between the delimiters <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>, or (since C99)  following <code>//</code> until the end of the line. Comments delimited by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> do not nest, and these sequences of characters are not interpreted as comment delimiters if they appear inside [[string literal|string]] or character literals.<ref name=\"KandR1\">{{cite book\n | last = Kernighan\n | first = Brian W.\n | authorlink = Brian Kernighan\n | last2 = Ritchie\n | first2 = Dennis M.\n | authorlink2 = Dennis Ritchie\n | title = The C Programming Language\n | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]\n | series =\n | volume =\n | edition = 2nd\n | year = 1996\n | location =\n | page = 192\n | language =\n | url =\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 7 302 02412 X\n | mr =\n | zbl =\n | jfm = }}</ref>\n\nC source files contain declarations and function definitions. Function definitions, in turn, contain declarations and [[Statement (computer science)|statements]]. Declarations either define new types using keywords such as <code>struct</code>, <code>union</code>, and <code>enum</code>, or assign types to and perhaps reserve storage for new variables, usually by writing the type followed by the variable name. Keywords such as <code>char</code> and <code>int</code> specify built-in types. Sections of code are enclosed in braces (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>, sometimes called \"curly brackets\") to limit the scope of declarations and to act as a single statement for control structures.\n\nAs an imperative language, C uses ''statements'' to specify actions. The most common statement is an ''expression statement'', consisting of an expression to be evaluated, followed by a semicolon; as a side effect of the evaluation, functions may be [[procedure call|called]] and variables may be [[assignment (computer science)|assigned]] new values. To modify the normal sequential execution of statements, C provides several control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords. [[Structured programming]] is supported by <code>if</code>(-<code>else</code>) conditional execution and by <code>do</code>-<code>while</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code> iterative execution (looping). The <code>for</code> statement has separate initialization, testing, and reinitialization expressions, any or all of which can be omitted. <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> can be used to leave the innermost enclosing loop statement or skip to its reinitialization. There is also a non-structured <code>[[goto]]</code> statement which branches directly to the designated [[Label (computer science)|label]] within the function. <code>switch</code> selects a <code>case</code> to be executed based on the value of an integer expression.\n\nExpressions can use a variety of built-in operators and may contain function calls. The order in which arguments to functions and operands to most operators are evaluated is unspecified. The evaluations may even be interleaved. However, all side effects (including storage to variables) will occur before the next \"[[sequence point]]\"; sequence points include the end of each expression statement, and the entry to and return from each function call.  Sequence points also occur during evaluation of expressions containing certain operators (<code>&&</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>[[?:]]</code> and the [[comma operator]]). This permits a high degree of object code optimization by the compiler, but requires C programmers to take more care to obtain reliable results than is needed for other programming languages.\n\nKernighan and Ritchie say in the Introduction of ''The C Programming Language'': \"C, like any other language, has its blemishes. Some of the operators have the wrong precedence; some parts of the syntax could be better.\"{{refn|Page 3 of the original K&R<ref name=\"k&r1e\" />}} The C standard did not attempt to correct many of these blemishes, because of the impact of such changes on already existing software.\n\n=== Character set ===\nThe basic C source character set includes the following characters:\n\n* Lowercase and uppercase letters of ISO Basic Latin Alphabet: <code>a</code>\u2013<code>z</code> <code>A</code>\u2013<code>Z</code>\n* Decimal digits: <code>0</code>\u2013<code>9</code>\n* Graphic characters: <code>! \" # % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? [ \\ ] ^ _ { | } ~</code>\n* [[Whitespace character]]s: ''[[space (punctuation)|space]]'', ''[[Tab character|horizontal tab]]'', ''[[Tab character|vertical tab]]'', ''[[Page break|form feed]]'', ''[[newline]]''\n\nNewline indicates the end of a text line; it need not correspond to an actual single character, although for convenience C treats it as one.\n\nAdditional multi-byte encoded characters may be used in string literals, but they are not entirely [[software portability|portable]].  The latest C standard ([[C11 (C standard revision)|C11]]) allows multi-national [[Unicode]] characters to be embedded portably within C source text by using <code>\\uXXXX</code> or <code>\\UXXXXXXXX</code> encoding (where the <code>X</code> denotes a hexadecimal character), although this feature is not yet widely implemented.\n\nThe basic C execution character set contains the same characters, along with representations for [[Bell character|alert]], [[backspace]], and [[carriage return]]. [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|Run-time]] support for extended character sets has increased with each revision of the C standard.\n\n=== Reserved words ===\nC89 has 32 reserved words, also known as keywords, which are the words that cannot be used for any purposes other than those for which they are predefined:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=20%}}\n:<code>auto</code>\n:<code>break</code>\n:<code>case</code>\n:<code>char</code>\n:<code>const</code>\n:<code>continue</code>\n:<code>default</code>\n:<code>do</code>\n{{col-break|width=20%}}\n:<code>[[double precision|double]]</code>\n:<code>else</code>\n:<code>[[enumerated type|enum]]</code>\n:<code>[[External variable|extern]]</code>\n:<code>[[floating point|float]]</code>\n:<code>[[for loop|for]]</code>\n:<code>[[goto]]</code>\n:<code>if</code>\n{{col-break|width=20%}}\n:<code>int</code>\n:<code>[[long integer|long]]</code>\n:<code>[[register (C programming language)|register]]</code>\n:<code>return</code>\n:<code>[[short integer|short]]</code>\n:<code>signed</code>\n:<code>[[sizeof]]</code>\n:<code>[[Static (keyword)|static]]</code>\n{{col-break}}\n:<code>[[struct (C programming language)|struct]]</code>\n:<code>[[switch statement|switch]]</code>\n:<code>typedef</code>\n:<code>union</code>\n:<code>unsigned</code>\n:<code>[[void type|void]]</code>\n:<code>[[volatile variable|volatile]]</code>\n:<code>[[while loop|while]]</code>\n{{col-end}}\n\nC99 reserved five more words:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=20%}}\n:<code>_Bool</code>\n:<code>_Complex</code>\n{{col-break|width=20%}}\n:<code>_Imaginary</code>\n:<code>[[Inline function|inline]]</code>\n{{col-break}}\n:<code>[[restrict]]</code>\n{{col-end}}\n\nC11 reserved seven more words:<ref name=\"AutoTX-7\" />\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=20%}}\n:<code>_Alignas</code>\n:<code>_Alignof</code>\n{{col-break|width=20%}}\n:<code>_Atomic</code>\n:<code>_Generic</code>\n{{col-break|width=20%}}\n:<code>_Noreturn</code>\n:<code>_Static_assert</code>\n{{col-break}}\n:<code>_Thread_local</code>\n{{col-end}}\n\nMost of the recently reserved words begin with an underscore followed by a capital letter, because identifiers of that form were previously reserved by the C standard for use only by implementations.  Since existing program source code should not have been using these identifiers, it would not be affected when C implementations started supporting these extensions to the programming language.  Some standard headers do define more convenient synonyms for underscored identifiers. The language previously included a reserved word called <code>entry</code>, but this was seldom implemented, and has now been removed as a reserved word.<ref name=\"KandR2\">{{cite book\n | last = Kernighan\n | first = Brian W.\n | authorlink = Brian Kernighan\n | last2 = Ritchie\n | first2 = Dennis M.\n | authorlink2 = Dennis Ritchie\n | title = The C Programming Language\n | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]\n | series =\n | volume =\n | edition = 2nd\n | year = 1996\n | location =\n | pages = 192, 259\n | language =\n | url =\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 7 302 02412 X\n | mr =\n | zbl =\n | jfm = }}</ref>\n\n=== Operators ===\n{{Main article|Operators in C and C++}}\n\nC supports a rich set of [[Operator (computer programming)|operators]], which are symbols used within an [[Expression (computer science)|expression]] to specify the manipulations to be performed while evaluating that expression. C has operators for:\n\n* [[arithmetic]]: [[addition|<code>+</code>]], [[subtraction|<code>-</code>]], [[multiplication|<code>*</code>]], [[division (mathematics)|<code>/</code>]], [[modulo operation|<code>%</code>]]\n* [[assignment (computer science)|assignment]]: <code>=</code>\n* [[augmented assignment]]: <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>%=</code>, <code>&=</code>, <code>|=</code>, <code>^=</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>\n* [[Bitwise operation|bitwise logic]]: <code>~</code>, <code>&</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>^</code>\n* [[Bit shift|bitwise shifts]]: <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>\n* [[Boolean algebra|boolean logic]]: <code>!</code>, <code>&&</code>, <code>||</code>\n* [[?:|conditional evaluation]]: [[?:|<code>? :</code>]]\n* equality testing: [[equality (mathematics)|<code>==</code>]], [[inequality (mathematics)|<code>!=</code>]]\n* [[Subroutine|calling functions]]: <code>( )</code>\n* [[increment and decrement operators|increment and decrement]]: <code>++</code>, <code>--</code>\n* [[record (computer science)|member selection]]: <code>.</code>, <code>-></code>\n* object size: <code>[[sizeof]]</code>\n* [[Order theory|order relations]]: <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>\n* [[pointer (computer programming)|reference and dereference]]: <code>&</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>[ ]</code>\n* sequencing: [[comma operator|<code>,</code>]]\n* [[order of operations#Mathematical precedence|subexpression grouping]]: <code>( )</code>\n* [[type conversion]]: <code>(''typename'')</code>\n\nC uses the operator <code>=</code> (used in mathematics to express equality) to indicate assignment, following the precedent of [[Fortran]] and [[PL/I]], but unlike [[ALGOL]] and its derivatives. C uses the operator <code>==</code> to test for equality.  The similarity between these two operators (assignment and equality) may result in the accidental use of one in place of the other, and in many cases, the mistake does not produce an error message (although some compilers produce warnings). For example, the conditional expression  <code>if(a==b+1)</code> might mistakenly be written as <code>if(a=b+1)</code>, which will be evaluated as true if <code>a</code> is not zero after the assignment.<ref name=\"AutoTX-8\" />\n\nThe C [[Order of operations|operator precedence]] is not always intuitive.  For example, the operator <code>==</code> binds more tightly than (is executed prior to) the operators <code>&</code> (bitwise AND) and <code>|</code> (bitwise OR) in expressions such as <code>x & 1 == 0</code>, which must be written as <code>(x & 1) == 0</code> if that is the coder's intent.<ref name=\"AutoTX-9\" />\n\n== {{anchor|HELLOWORLD}}\"Hello, world\" example ==\nThe \"[[\"Hello, World!\" program|hello, world]]\" example, which appeared in the first edition of [[The C Programming Language (book)|K&R]], has become the model for an introductory program in most programming textbooks, regardless of programming language. The program prints \"hello, world\" to the [[standard output]], which is usually a terminal or screen display.\n\nThe original version was:{{refn|Page 6 of the original K&R<ref name=\"k&r1e\" />}}\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nmain()\n{\n    printf(\"hello, world\\n\");\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA standard-conforming \"hello, world\" program is:{{Efn|The original example code will compile on most modern compilers that are not in strict standard compliance mode, but it does not fully conform to the requirements of either C89 or C99. In fact, C99 requires that a diagnostic message be produced.}}\n\n<!-- READ THIS BEFORE YOU EDIT! If you think there is a better way, first see talk page archive No. 8 for why. If you still want to change it, discuss it first.\n-->\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf(\"hello, world\\n\");\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe first line of the program contains a [[Preprocessor|preprocessing directive]], indicated by <code>#include</code>.  This causes the compiler to replace that line with the entire text of the <code>[[stdio.h]]</code> standard header, which contains declarations for standard input and output functions such as <code>printf</code>. The angle brackets surrounding <code>stdio.h</code> indicate that <code>stdio.h</code> is located using a search strategy that prefers headers provided with the compiler to other headers having the same name, as opposed to double quotes which typically include local or project-specific header files.\n\nThe next line indicates that a function named <code>main</code> is being defined. The <code>[[main function (programming)|main]]</code> function serves a special purpose in C programs; the run-time environment calls the <code>main</code> function to begin program execution. The type specifier <code>int</code> indicates that the value that is returned to the invoker (in this case the run-time environment) as a result of evaluating the <code>main</code> function, is an integer. The keyword <code>void</code> as a parameter list indicates that this function takes no arguments.{{Efn|The <code>main</code> function actually has two arguments, <code>int argc</code> and <code>char *argv[]</code>, respectively, which can be used to handle [[command line arguments]].  The ISO C standard (section 5.1.2.2.1) requires both forms of <code>main</code> to be supported, which is special treatment not afforded to any other function.}}\n\nThe opening curly brace indicates the beginning of the definition of the <code>main</code> function.\n\nThe next line ''calls'' (diverts execution to) a function named <code>[[printf]]</code>, which in this case is supplied from a system [[library (computing)|library]].  In this call, the <code>printf</code> function is ''passed'' (provided with) a single argument, the address of the first character in the [[string literal]] <code>\"hello, world\\n\"</code>. The string literal is an unnamed [[Array data type|array]] with elements of type <code>char</code>, set up automatically by the compiler with a final 0-valued character to mark the end of the array (<code>printf</code> needs to know this). The <code>\\n</code> is an ''[[escape sequences in C|escape sequence]]'' that C translates to a ''[[newline]]'' character, which on output signifies the end of the current line.  The return value of the <code>printf</code> function is of type <code>int</code>, but it is silently discarded since it is not used. (A more careful program might test the return value to determine whether or not the <code>printf</code> function succeeded.) The semicolon <code>;</code> terminates the statement.\n\nThe closing curly brace indicates the end of the code for the <code>main</code> function. According to the C99 specification and newer, the <code>main</code> function, unlike any other function, will implicitly return a value of <code>0</code> upon reaching the <code>}</code> that terminates the function. (Formerly an explicit <code>return 0;</code> statement was required.) This is interpreted by the run-time system as an exit code indicating successful execution.<ref name=\"bk21st\">{{cite book |last=Klemens |first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Klemens |title=21st Century C |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |year=2013 |isbn=1-4493-2714-1}}</ref>\n\n== Data types ==\n{{Main article|C variable types and declarations}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}\n\nThe [[type system]] in C is [[static typing|static]] and [[weak typing|weakly typed]], which makes it similar to the type system of [[ALGOL]] descendants such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].<ref>{{cite journal | title=Comparison of the Programming Languages C and Pascal | journal=ACM Computing Surveys | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=73\u201392 | doi=10.1145/356869.356872 | first1=Alan R. | last1=Feuer | first2=Narain H. | last2=Gehani | subscription=yes | date=March 1982}}</ref>  There are built-in types for integers of various sizes, both signed and unsigned, [[floating-point number]]s, and enumerated types (<code>enum</code>).  Integer type <code>char</code> is often used for single-byte characters.  C99 added a [[boolean datatype]].  There are also derived types including [[Array data type|arrays]], [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]], [[record (computer science)|records]] (<code>[[Struct (C programming language)|struct]]</code>), and [[union (computer science)|unions]] (<code>union</code>).\n\nC is often used in low-level systems programming where escapes from the type system may be necessary.  The compiler attempts to ensure type correctness of most expressions, but the programmer can override the checks in various ways, either by using a ''[[type conversion|type cast]]'' to explicitly convert a value from one type to another, or by using pointers or unions to reinterpret the underlying bits of a data object in some other way.\n\nSome find C's declaration syntax unintuitive, particularly for [[function pointer]]s. (Ritchie's idea was to declare identifiers in contexts resembling their use: \"[[declaration reflects use]]\".){{refn|Page 122 of K&R2<ref name=\"k&r2e\" />}}\n\nC's ''usual arithmetic conversions'' allow for efficient code to be generated, but can sometimes produce unexpected results.  For example, a comparison of signed and unsigned integers of equal width requires a conversion of the signed value to unsigned.  This can generate unexpected results if the signed value is negative.\n\n=== Pointers ===\nC supports the use of [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]], a type of [[reference (computer science)|reference]] that records the address or location of an object or function in memory.  Pointers can be ''dereferenced'' to access data stored at the address pointed to, or to invoke a pointed-to function.  Pointers can be manipulated using assignment or [[pointer arithmetic]].  The run-time representation of a pointer value is typically a raw memory address (perhaps augmented by an offset-within-word field), but since a pointer's type includes the type of the thing pointed to, expressions including pointers can be type-checked at compile time.  Pointer arithmetic is automatically scaled by the size of the pointed-to data type. Pointers are used for many purposes in C.  [[String (computer science)|Text strings]] are commonly manipulated using pointers into arrays of characters.  [[Dynamic memory allocation]] is performed using pointers.  Many data types, such as [[tree (data structure)|trees]], are commonly implemented as dynamically allocated <code>struct</code> objects linked together using pointers.  Pointers to functions are useful for passing functions as arguments to [[higher-order function]]s (such as [[qsort]] or [[bsearch]]) or as [[callback (computer science)|callbacks]] to be invoked by event handlers.<ref name=\"bk21st\" />\n\nA ''[[null pointer]] value'' explicitly points to no valid location.  Dereferencing a null pointer value is undefined, often resulting in a [[segmentation fault]].  Null pointer values are useful for indicating special cases such as no \"next\" pointer in the final node of a [[linked list]], or as an error indication from functions returning pointers.  In appropriate contexts in source code, such as for assigning to a pointer variable, a ''null pointer constant'' can be written as <code>0</code>, with or without explicit casting to a pointer type, or as the <code>NULL</code> macro defined by several standard headers.  In conditional contexts, null pointer values evaluate to false, while all other pointer values evaluate to true.\n\nVoid pointers (<code>void *</code>) point to objects of unspecified type, and can therefore be used as \"generic\" data pointers. Since the size and type of the pointed-to object is not known, void pointers cannot be dereferenced, nor is pointer arithmetic on them allowed, although they can easily be (and in many contexts implicitly are) converted to and from any other object pointer type.<ref name=\"bk21st\" />\n\nCareless use of pointers is potentially dangerous.  Because they are typically unchecked, a pointer variable can be made to point to any arbitrary location, which can cause undesirable effects.  Although properly used pointers point to safe places, they can be made to point to unsafe places by using invalid [[pointer arithmetic]]; the objects they point to may continue to be used after deallocation ([[dangling pointer]]s); they may be used without having been initialized ([[wild pointer]]s); or they may be directly assigned an unsafe value using a cast, union, or through another corrupt pointer.  In general, C is permissive in allowing manipulation of and conversion between pointer types, although compilers typically provide options for various levels of checking. Some other programming languages address these problems by using more restrictive [[reference (computer science)|reference]] types.\n\n=== Arrays ===\n{{See also|C string}}\n<!-- Please be careful when editing this.  C does *not* forbid bounds checking, nor does it require that pointers are memory addresses.  Of course it does not require bounds checks, either, and all common implementations map those language constructs to the machine in an \"obvious way\", but there are ANSI-conforming implementations that handle these things in other ways. -->\n\n[[Array data type|Array]] types in C are traditionally of a fixed, static size specified at compile time.  (The more recent C99 standard also allows a form of variable-length arrays.)  However, it is also possible to allocate a block of memory (of arbitrary size) at run-time, using the standard library's <code>malloc</code> function, and treat it as an array.  C's unification of arrays and pointers means that declared arrays and these dynamically allocated simulated arrays are virtually interchangeable.\n\nSince arrays are always accessed (in effect) via pointers, array accesses are typically ''not'' checked against the underlying array size, although some compilers may provide [[bounds checking]] as an option.<ref name=\"AutoTX-10\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Programming with C|last=\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e34\u0e27\u0e07\u0e28\u0e4c|first=\u0e42\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e32\u0e28|publisher=SE-EDUCATION PUBLIC COMPANY LIMITED|year=2016|isbn=978-616-08-2740-4|location=Bangkok, Thailand|pages=225-230}}</ref>  Array bounds violations are therefore possible and rather common in carelessly written code, and can lead to various repercussions, including illegal memory accesses, corruption of data, [[buffer overflow|buffer overruns]], and run-time exceptions.  If bounds checking is desired, it must be done manually.\n\nC does not have a special provision for declaring [[multi-dimensional array]]s, but rather relies on [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] within the type system to declare arrays of arrays, which effectively accomplishes the same thing.  The index values of the resulting \"multi-dimensional array\" can be thought of as increasing in [[row-major order]].\n\nMulti-dimensional arrays are commonly used in numerical algorithms (mainly from applied [[linear algebra]]) to store matrices. The structure of the C array is well suited to this particular task. However, since arrays are passed merely as pointers, the bounds of the array must be known fixed values or else explicitly passed to any subroutine that requires them, and dynamically sized arrays of arrays cannot be accessed using double indexing. (A workaround for this is to allocate the array with an additional \"row vector\" of pointers to the columns.) \n\nC99 introduced \"variable-length arrays\" which address some, but not all, of the issues with ordinary C arrays.\n\n=== Array\u2013pointer interchangeability ===\nThe subscript notation <code>x[i]</code> (where <code>x</code> designates a pointer) is [[syntactic sugar]] for <code>*(x+i)</code>.<ref name=\"Raymond1996\" /> Taking advantage of the compiler's knowledge of the pointer type, the address that <code>x + i</code> points to is not the base address (pointed to by <code>x</code>) incremented by <code>i</code> bytes, but rather is defined to be the base address incremented by <code>i</code> multiplied by the size of an element that <code>x</code> points to.  Thus, <code>x[i]</code> designates the <code>i+1</code>th element of the array.\n\nFurthermore, in most expression contexts (a notable exception is as operand of <code>[[sizeof]]</code>), the name of an array is automatically converted to a pointer to the array's first element. This implies that an array is never copied as a whole when named as an argument to a function, but rather only the address of its first element is passed. Therefore, although function calls in C use [[call-by-value|pass-by-value]] semantics, arrays are in effect passed by [[reference (computer science)|reference]].\n\nThe size of an element can be determined by applying the operator <code>sizeof</code> to any dereferenced element of <code>x</code>, as in <code>n = sizeof *x</code> or <code>n = sizeof x[0]</code>, and the number of elements in a declared array <code>A</code> can be determined as <code>sizeof A / sizeof A[0]</code>. The latter only applies to array names: variables declared with subscripts (<code>int A[20]</code>). Due to the semantics of C, it is not possible to determine the entire size of arrays through pointers to arrays or those created by dynamic allocation (<code>[[malloc]]</code>); code such as <code>sizeof arr / sizeof arr[0]</code> (where <code>arr</code> designates a pointer) will not work since the compiler assumes the size of the pointer itself is being requested.<ref name=\"cfaq623\" /><ref name=\"cfaq728\" /> Since array name arguments to <code>sizeof</code> are not converted to pointers, they do not exhibit such ambiguity. However, arrays created by dynamic allocation are accessed by pointers rather than true array variables, so they suffer from the same <code>sizeof</code> issues as array pointers.\n\nThus, despite this apparent equivalence between array and pointer variables, there is still a distinction to be made between them. Even though the name of an array is, in most expression contexts, converted into a pointer (to its first element), this pointer does not itself occupy any storage; the array name is not an [[Value (computer science)|l-value]], and its address is a constant, unlike a pointer variable. Consequently, what an array \"points to\" cannot be changed, and it is impossible to assign a new address to an array name. Array contents may be copied, however, by using the <code>memcpy</code> function, or by accessing the individual elements.\n\n== Memory management ==\nOne of the most important functions of a programming language is to provide facilities for managing [[computer memory|memory]] and the objects that are stored in memory. C provides three distinct ways to allocate memory for objects:<ref name=\"bk21st\" />\n\n* [[Static memory allocation]]: space for the object is provided in the binary at compile-time; these objects have an [[Variable (programming)#Scope and extent|extent]] (or lifetime) as long as the binary which contains them is loaded into memory.\n* [[Automatic memory allocation]]: temporary objects can be stored on the [[call stack|stack]], and this space is automatically freed and reusable after the block in which they are declared is exited.\n* [[Dynamic memory allocation]]: blocks of memory of arbitrary size can be requested at run-time using library functions such as <code>[[malloc]]</code> from a region of memory called the [[dynamic memory allocation|heap]]; these blocks persist until subsequently freed for reuse by calling the library function <code>[[malloc|realloc]]</code> or <code>[[malloc|free]]</code>\n\nThese three approaches are appropriate in different situations and have various trade-offs. For example, static memory allocation has little allocation overhead, automatic allocation may involve slightly more overhead, and dynamic memory allocation can potentially have a great deal of overhead for both allocation and deallocation. The persistent nature of static objects is useful for maintaining state information across function calls, automatic allocation is easy to use but stack space is typically much more limited and transient than either static memory or heap space, and dynamic memory allocation allows convenient allocation of objects whose size is known only at run-time. Most C programs make extensive use of all three.\n\nWhere possible, automatic or static allocation is usually simplest because the storage is managed by the compiler, freeing the programmer of the potentially error-prone chore of manually allocating and releasing storage. However, many data structures can change in size at runtime, and since static allocations (and automatic allocations before C99) must have a fixed size at compile-time, there are many situations in which dynamic allocation is necessary.<ref name=\"bk21st\" />  Prior to the C99 standard, variable-sized arrays were a common example of this. (See the article on <code>[[malloc]]</code> for an example of dynamically allocated arrays.) Unlike automatic allocation, which can fail at run time with uncontrolled consequences, the dynamic allocation functions return an indication (in the form of a null pointer value) when the required storage cannot be allocated.  (Static allocation that is too large is usually detected by the [[Linker (computing)|linker]] or [[Loader (computing)|loader]], before the program can even begin execution.)\n\nUnless otherwise specified, static objects contain zero or null pointer values upon program startup. Automatically and dynamically allocated objects are initialized only if an initial value is explicitly specified; otherwise they initially have indeterminate values (typically, whatever [[bit|bit pattern]] happens to be present in the [[computer storage|storage]], which might not even represent a valid value for that type). If the program attempts to access an uninitialized value, the results are undefined. Many modern compilers try to detect and warn about this problem, but both [[Type I and type II errors|false positives and false negatives]] can occur.\n\nAnother issue is that heap memory allocation has to be synchronized with its actual usage in any program in order for it to be reused as much as possible.  For example, if the only pointer to a heap memory allocation goes out of scope or has its value overwritten before <code>[[malloc|free()]]</code> is called, then that memory cannot be recovered for later reuse and is essentially lost to the program, a phenomenon known as a ''[[memory leak]].'' Conversely, it is possible for memory to be freed but continue to be referenced, leading to unpredictable results. Typically, the symptoms will appear in a portion of the program far removed from the actual error, making it difficult to track down the problem. (Such issues are ameliorated in languages with [[garbage collection (computer science)|automatic garbage collection]].)\n\n== Libraries ==\nThe C programming language uses [[library (computing)|libraries]] as its primary method of extension. In C, a library is a set of functions contained within a single \"archive\" file.  Each library typically has a [[header file]], which contains the prototypes of the functions contained within the library that may be used by a program, and declarations of special data types and macro symbols used with these functions. In order for a program to use a library, it must include the library's header file, and the library must be linked with the program, which in many cases requires [[compiler flag]]s (e.g., <code>-lm</code>, shorthand for \"link the math library\").<ref name=\"bk21st\" />\n\nThe most common C library is the [[C standard library]], which is specified by the [[ISO standard|ISO]] and [[ANSI C]] standards and comes with every C implementation (implementations which target limited environments such as [[embedded systems]] may provide only a subset of the standard library). This library supports stream input and output, memory allocation, mathematics, character strings, and time values.  Several separate standard headers (for example, <code>stdio.h</code>) specify the interfaces for these and other standard library facilities.\n\nAnother common set of C library functions are those used by applications specifically targeted for [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, especially functions which provide an interface to the [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]]. These functions are detailed in various standards such as [[POSIX]] and the [[Single UNIX Specification]].\n\nSince many programs have been written in C, there are a wide variety of other libraries available. Libraries are often written in C because C compilers generate efficient [[object code]]; programmers then create interfaces to the library so that the routines can be used from higher-level languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].<ref name=\"bk21st\" />\n\n== Language tools ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2014}}\n\nA number of tools have been developed to help C programmers find and fix statements with undefined behavior or possibly erroneous expressions, with greater rigor than that provided by the compiler.  The tool [[Lint (software)|lint]] was the first such, leading to many others.\n\nAutomated source code checking and auditing are beneficial in any language, and for C many such tools exist, such as [[lint (software)|Lint]]. A common practice is to use Lint to detect questionable code when a program is first written. Once a program passes Lint, it is then compiled using the C compiler. Also, many compilers can optionally warn about syntactically valid constructs that are likely to actually be errors. [[MISRA C]] is a proprietary set of guidelines to avoid such questionable code, developed for embedded systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unix.com/man-page/FreeBSD/1/lint |title=Man Page for lint (freebsd Section 1) |website=unix.com |date=2001-05-24 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>\n\nThere are also compilers, libraries, and operating system level mechanisms for performing actions that are not a standard part of C, such as [[bounds checking]] for arrays, detection of [[buffer overflow]], [[serialization]], [[Memory management|dynamic memory]] tracking, and [[garbage collection (computer science)|automatic garbage collection]].\n\nTools such as [[IBM Rational Purify|Purify]] or [[Valgrind]] and linking with libraries containing special versions of the [[malloc|memory allocation functions]] can help uncover runtime errors in memory usage.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Tiobe index.png|thumb|upright=1.9|The [[TIOBE index]] graph, showing a comparison of the popularity of various programming languages<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/01/java-no-longer-a-favorite/|title=Is Java Losing Its Mojo? |first=Robert |last=McMillan |date=2013-08-01 |publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''}}</ref>]]\n\nC is widely used for [[system programming]] in implementing [[operating system]]s and [[embedded system]] applications,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/894992484|title=Programming and problem solving with C++ : brief, sixth edition|last=Chip.|first=Weems,|date=2014|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=1449694284|oclc=894992484}}</ref> because C code, when written for portability, can be used for most purposes, yet when needed, system-specific code can be used to access specific hardware addresses and to perform [[type punning]] to match externally imposed interface requirements, with a low [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] demand on system resources.\n\nC can also be used for website programming using [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] as a \"gateway\" for information between the Web application, the server, and the browser.<ref name=\"AutoTX-11\" /> C is often chosen over [[interpreted language]]s because of its speed, stability, and near-universal availability.<ref name=\"AutoTX-12\" />\n\nOne consequence of C's wide availability and efficiency is that [[compiler]]s, libraries and [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]] of other programming languages are often implemented in C. The [[reference implementation]]s of [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl]] and [[PHP]], for example, are all written in C.\n\nBecause the layer of abstraction is thin and the overhead is low, C enables programmers to create efficient implementations of algorithms and data structures, useful for computationally intense programs. For example, the [[GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library]], the [[GNU Scientific Library]], [[Mathematica]], and [[MATLAB]] are completely or partially written in C.\n\nC is sometimes used as an [[intermediate language]] by implementations of other languages. This approach may be used for portability or convenience; by using C as an intermediate language, additional machine-specific code generators are not necessary.  C has some features, such as line-number preprocessor directives and optional superfluous commas at the end of initializer lists, that support compilation of generated code. However, some of C's shortcomings have prompted the development of other [[List of C-family programming languages|C-based languages]] specifically designed for use as intermediate languages, such as [[C--]].\n\nC has also been widely used to implement [[end-user (computer science)|end-user]] applications. However, such applications can also be written in newer, higher-level languages.\n\n== Related languages ==\nC has both directly and indirectly influenced many later languages such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Limbo (programming language)|Limbo]], [[LPC (programming language)|LPC]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and Unix's [[C shell]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922324121|title=Pillars of computing : a compendium of select, pivotal technology firms|last=Gerard),|first=O'Regan, Gerard (Cornelius|isbn=3319214640|oclc=922324121}}</ref> The most pervasive influence has been syntactical, all of the languages mentioned combine the statement and (more or less recognizably) expression [[C syntax|syntax of C]] with type systems, data models and/or large-scale program structures that differ from those of C, sometimes radically.\n\nSeveral C or near-C interpreters exist, including [[Ch (computer programming)|Ch]] and [[CINT]], which can also be used for scripting.\n\nWhen object-oriented languages became popular, [[C++]] and [[Objective-C]] were two different extensions of C that provided object-oriented capabilities.

A combined license for both parts was also sold.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game differs from most roguelikes in a number of ways. Its interface is mouse-dependent, but supports keyboard shortcuts (such as 'g' to get an item). ''Castle of the Winds'' also allows the player to restore saved games after dying.\n\n===Magic===\nThe game favors the use of magic in combat, as spells are the only weapons that work from a distance. The [[player character]] automatically gains a spell with each [[Experience point|experience level]], and can permanently gain others using corresponding books, until all thirty spells available are learned. There are two opposing pairs of elements: cold vs. fire and lightning vs. acid/poison. Spells are divided into six categories: attack, defense, healing, movement, divination, and miscellaneous.\n\n===Items===\n''Castle of the Winds'' possesses an inventory system that limits a player's load based on weight and bulk, rather than by number of items. It allows the character to use different containers, including packs, belts, chests, and bags. Other items include weapons, armor, protective clothing, purses, and ornamental jewellery. Almost every item in the game can be normal, cursed, or enchanted, with curses and enchantments working in a manner similar to ''[[NetHack]]''. Although items do not break with use, they may already be broken or rusted when found. Most objects that the character currently carries can be renamed.\n\n===Town Services===\nWherever the player goes before entering the dungeon, there is always a town which offers the basic services of a temple for healing and curing curses, a junk store where anything can be sold for a few copper coins, a sage who can identify items and (from the second town onwards) a bank for storing the total capacity of coins to lighten the player's load. Other services that differ and vary in what they sell are outfitters, weaponsmiths, armoursmiths, magic shops and general stores.\n\n===Time===\nThe game tracks how much time has been spent playing the game. Although story events are not triggered by the passage of time, it does determine when merchants rotate their stock. Victorious players are listed as \"[[Valhalla]]'s Champions\" in the order of time taken, from fastest to slowest. If the player dies, they are still put on the list, but are categorized as \"Dead\", with their experience point total listed as at the final killing blow. The amount of time spent also determines the difficulty of the last boss.\n\n==Plot==\nThough it is secondary to its [[hack and slash]] gameplay, ''Castle of the Winds'' has a plot loosely based on [[Norse mythology]], told with setting changes, unique items, and occasional passages of text.\n\nThe player begins in a tiny [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]], near which he/she used to live. His/her [[farm]] has been destroyed and [[godparent]]s killed. After clearing out an abandoned mine, the player finds a scrap of parchment that reveals the death of the player's godparents was ordered by an unknown enemy. The player then returns to the hamlet to find it pillaged, and decides to travel to Bjarnarhaven.\n\nOnce in Bjarnarhaven, the player explores the levels beneath a nearby fortress, eventually facing Hrungnir, the Hill Giant Lord, responsible for ordering the player's godparents' death. Hrungnir carries the Enchanted Amulet of Kings. Upon activating the amulet, the player is informed of his/her past by his/her dead father, after which the player is transported to the town of Crossroads, and ''Part I'' ends. The game can be imported or started over in ''Part II''.\n\nThe town of Crossroads is run by a Jarl who at first does not admit the player, but later (on up to three occasions) provides advice and rewards. The player then enters the nearby ruined titular Castle of the Winds. There the player meets his/her deceased grandfather, who instructs him/her to venture into the dungeons below, defeat Surtur, and reclaim their birthright. Venturing deeper, the player encounters monsters run rampant, a desecrated crypt, a necromancer, and the installation of various special rooms for elementals. The player eventually meets and defeats the Wolf-Man leader, Bear-Man leader, the four [[J\u00f6tunn|Jotun]] kings, a Demon Lord, and finally Surtur. Upon defeating Surtur and escaping the dungeons, the player sits upon the throne, completing the game.\n\n==Development==\nInspired by his love of RPGs and while learning Windows programming in the 80s, Rick Saada designed and completed Castle of the Winds. The game sold 13,500 copies. By 1998, the game's author, Rick Saada, decided to distribute the entirety of ''Castle of the Winds'' free of charge.<ref name=\"saada\"/>\n\nThe game is public domain per Rick Saada's words: {{quote|Rick Saada, creator of Castle of the Winds, decided that it should be public domain so he has given permission for anyone to distribute it for free. (Epic doesn't have an exclusive license to sell it).\"<ref name=\"odin-downloads\"/>}}\n\n===Graphics===\nAll terrain tiles, some landscape features, all monsters and objects, and some spell/effect graphics take the form of Windows 3.1 icons and were done by Paul Canniff. Multi-tile graphics, such as ball spells and town buildings, are bitmaps included in the executable file. No graphics use colors other than the Windows-standard 16-color palette, plus transparency. They exist in monochrome versions as well, meaning that the game will display well on monochrome monitors.\n\nThe map view is identical to the playing-field view, except for scaling to fit on one screen. A simplified map view is available to improve performance on slower computers. The latter functionality also presents a cleaner display, as the aforementioned scaling routine does not always work correctly.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{moby game|id=/castle-of-the-winds}}\n\n[[Category:1989 video games]]\n[[Category:Roguelike video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n[[Category:Freeware games]]\n[[Category:Video games using procedural generation]]\n[[Category:Public-domain software]]", "sha1": "bd8barqgkozswk52y8uxap056ayabmh"}}, {"title": "Calvinism", "ns": "0", "id": "6024", "revision": {"id": "864309794", "parentid": "864309453", "timestamp": "2018-10-16T12:25:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "Gilliam", "id": "506179"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/96.91.129.129|96.91.129.129]] ([[User talk:96.91.129.129|talk]]) to last version by Materialscientist", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect2|Reformed|Reformed church|other uses of Reformed|Reform (disambiguation)|Reformed churches originating in continental Europe|Continental Reformed church}}\n{{for|the theology of John Calvin himself|Theology of John Calvin}}\n{{Blacklisted-links|1=\n*http://cruciality.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/reformed-identity-by-eberhard-busch-reformed-world-december-2008.pdf\n*:''Triggered by <code>\\bfiles\\.wordpress\\.com\\b</code> on the global blacklist''|bot=Cyberbot II|invisible=true}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n[[File:ReformationWallGeneva.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Statues of [[William Farel]], [[John Calvin]], [[Theodore Beza]], and [[John Knox]] at the centre of the [[International Monument to the Reformation]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].

The term ''Calvinism'' can be misleading, because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse, with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder. In the context of the Reformation, [[Huldrych Zwingli]] began the Reformed tradition in 1519 in the city of [[Z\u00fcrich]]. His followers were instantly deemed ''[[Zwinglians]]'', consistent with the Catholic practice of naming heresy after its founder. Very soon, Zwingli was joined by [[Martin Bucer]], [[Wolfgang Capito]], [[William Farel]], [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] and other early Reformed thinkers. The namesake of the movement, French reformer John Calvin, converted to the Reformed tradition from Roman Catholicism only in the late 1520s or early 1530s as it was already being developed. The movement was first called ''Calvinism'', referring to John Calvin, by Lutherans who opposed it. Many within the tradition find it either an indescriptive or an inappropriate term and would prefer the word ''Reformed'' to be used instead.<ref>{{cite book |last=H\u00e4gglund|first=Bengt|title=Teologins Historia|language=German|trans-title=History of Theology|others=Translated by Gene J. Lund|edition=Fourth Revised |year=2007 |location=Saint Louis|publisher=Concordia Publishing House}}</ref>{{sfn|Muller|2004|p=130}}\n\nThe most important Reformed theologians include John Calvin, [[Huldrych Zwingli]], [[Martin Bucer]], [[William Farel]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], [[Theodore Beza]], and [[John Knox]]. In the twentieth century, [[Abraham Kuyper]], [[Herman Bavinck]], [[B. B. Warfield]], [[J. Gresham Machen]], [[Karl Barth]], [[Martyn Lloyd-Jones]], [[Cornelius Van Til]], and [[Gordon Clark]] were influential. Contemporary Reformed theologians include [[J. I. Packer]], [[John F. MacArthur|John MacArthur]], [[R. C. Sproul]], [[Timothy J. Keller]], [[David F. Wells|David Wells]], and [[Michael Horton (theologian)|Michael Horton]].\n\nReformed churches may exercise several forms of [[ecclesiastical polity]]; most are [[presbyterian polity|presbyterian]] or [[congregationalist polity|congregationalist]], though some are [[episcopal polity|episcopalian]]. Calvinism is largely represented by [[Continental Reformed]], [[Presbyterian]], and [[Congregationalist church|Congregationalist]] traditions. The biggest Reformed association is the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]] with more than 100 million members in 211 member denominations around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wcrc.ch/theology/ |title=Theology and Communion |publisher=Wcrc.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wcrc.ch/wcrc-member-churches/ |title=Member Churches |publisher=Wcrc.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412134752/http://wcrc.ch/wcrc-member-churches/ |archivedate=12 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There are more conservative Reformed federations such as the [[World Reformed Fellowship]] and the [[International Conference of Reformed Churches]], as well as [[List of Reformed denominations|independent churches]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nCalvinism is named after [[John Calvin]]. It was first used by a Lutheran theologian in 1552. It was a common practice of the Catholic Church to name what it viewed as heresy after its founder. Nevertheless, the term first came out of Lutheran circles. Calvin denounced the designation himself:\n{{Quote|text=They could attach us no greater insult than this word, Calvinism. It is not hard to guess where such a deadly hatred comes from that they hold against me.|author=John Calvin, ''Le\u00e7ons ou commentaires et expositions sur les Revelations du prophete Jeremie'', 1565<ref name=\"Cottret2003\">{{cite book|author=Bernard Cottret|title=Calvin, A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn-xAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA239|date=22 May 2003|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-567-53035-6|pages=239\u2013}}</ref>}}\n\nDespite its negative connotation, this designation became increasingly popular in order to distinguish Calvinists from Lutherans and from newer Protestant branches that emerged later. The vast majority of churches that trace their history back to Calvin (including Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and a row of other Calvinist churches) do not use it themselves, since the designation \"Reformed\" is more generally accepted and preferred, especially in the [[English-speaking world]]. Moreover, these churches claim to be\u2014in accordance with John Calvin's own words\u2014\"renewed accordingly with the true order of gospel\".\n\nSince the [[Arminian controversy]], the Reformed tradition\u2014as a branch of [[Protestantism]] distinguished from Lutheranism\u2014divided into two separate groups: [[Arminians]] and Calvinists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reformed Churches |work=[[Christian Cyclopedia]]|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=r&word=REFORMEDCHURCHES}}</ref><ref>Gonzalez, Justo L. ''The Story of Christianity, Vol. Two: The Reformation to the Present Day'' (New York: HarperCollins, 1985; reprint \u2013 Peabody: Prince Press, 2008) 180</ref> However, it is now rare to call Arminians a part of the Reformed tradition. While the Reformed theological tradition addresses all of the traditional topics of Christian theology, the word ''Calvinism'' is sometimes used to refer to particular Calvinist views on [[Christian soteriology|soteriology]] and [[predestination]], which are summarized in part by the [[Calvinism#Five points of Calvinism|Five Points of Calvinism]]. Some have also argued that Calvinism as a whole stresses the [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|sovereignty]] or rule of God in all things including salvation.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Calvinism}}\n\n[[File:Geneva Cathedral.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Calvin preached at [[St. Pierre Cathedral]], the main church in Geneva.]]\n[[File:CalvinInstitutio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Calvin's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]: ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion|Institutio Christianae religionis]]'']]\n\nFirst-generation Reformed theologians include [[Huldrych Zwingli]] (1484\u20131531), [[Martin Bucer]] (1491\u20131551), [[Wolfgang Capito]] (1478\u20131541), [[John Oecolampadius]] (1482\u20131531), and [[Guillaume Farel]] (1489\u20131565). These reformers came from diverse academic backgrounds, but later distinctions within Reformed theology can already be detected in their thought, especially the priority of [[Bible|scripture]] as a source of authority. Scripture was also viewed as a unified whole, which led to a [[covenantal theology]] of the [[sacraments]] of [[baptism]] and the [[Lord's Supper]] as visible signs of the [[covenant of grace]]. Another Reformed distinctive present in these theologians was their denial of the bodily [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|presence of Christ in the Lord's supper]]. Each of these theologians also understood salvation to be by grace alone, and affirmed a doctrine of [[unconditional election|particular election]] (the teaching that some people are chosen by God for [[salvation]]). [[Martin Luther]] and his successor [[Philipp Melanchthon]] were undoubtedly significant influences on these theologians, and to a larger extent later Reformed theologians. The doctrine of [[justification by faith alone]] was a direct inheritance from Luther.{{sfn|Muller|2004|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n[[John Calvin]] (1509\u201364), [[Heinrich Bullinger]] (1504\u201375), [[Wolfgang Musculus]] (1497\u20131563), [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]] (1500\u201362), and [[Andreas Hyperius]] (1511\u201364) belong to the second generation of Reformed theologians. Calvin's ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' (1536\u201359) was one of the most influential theologies of the era.{{sfn|Muller|2004|p=132}} Toward the middle of the 16th century, the Reformed began to commit their beliefs to [[creed|confessions of faith]], which would shape the future definition of the Reformed faith. The 1549 ''[[Consensus Tigurinus]]'' brought together those who followed Zwingli and Bullinger's [[memorialist]] theology of the Lord's supper, which taught that the supper simply serves as a reminder of Christ's death, and Calvin's view that the supper serves as a [[means of grace]] with Christ actually present, though spiritually rather than bodily. The document demonstrates the diversity as well as unity in early Reformed theology. The remainder of the 16th century saw an explosion of confessional activity. The stability and breadth of Reformed theology during this  period stand in marked contrast to the bitter controversy experienced by Lutherans prior to the 1579 [[Formula of Concord]].{{sfn|Muller|2004|p=135}}\n\nDue to Calvin's missionary work in France, his programme of reform eventually reached the French-speaking provinces of the Netherlands. Calvinism was adopted in the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] under [[Frederick III, Elector Palatine|Frederick III]], which led to the formulation of the [[Heidelberg Catechism]] in 1563, and in [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] by [[Jeanne d'Albret]]. This and the [[Belgic Confession]] were adopted as confessional standards in the [[Synod of Emden|first synod]] of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] in 1571. Leading divines, either Calvinist or those sympathetic to Calvinism, settled in England (Martin Bucer, [[Peter Martyr Vermigli|Peter Martyr]], and [[Jan \u0141aski]]) and Scotland ([[John Knox]]). During the [[English Civil War]], the Calvinistic [[Puritan]]s produced the [[Westminster Confession]], which became the confessional standard for [[Presbyterians]] in the English-speaking world. Having established itself in Europe, the movement continued to spread to other parts of the world, including North America, South Africa, and Korea.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holder|2004|pp=246\u2013256}}; {{Harvnb|McGrath|1990| pp=198\u2013199}}</ref>\n\nCalvin did not live to see the foundation of his work grow into an international movement; but his death allowed his ideas to break out of their city of origin, to succeed far beyond their borders, and to establish their own distinct character.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pettegree|2004|p=222}}</ref>\n\n===Spread===\n[[File:Interior of the Oude kerk in Amsterdam (south nave), by Emanuel de Witte.jpg|thumb|Calvinism has been known at times for its simple, unadorned churches and lifestyles, as depicted in this painting of the interior of the [[Oude Kerk, Amsterdam|Oude kerk]] in [[Amsterdam]] by [[Emanuel de Witte]] c. 1661.]]\nAlthough much of Calvin's work was in [[Geneva]], his publications spread his ideas of a ''correctly'' Reformed church to many parts of Europe. In [[Switzerland]], some cantons are still Reformed, and some are Catholic. Calvinism became the theological system of the majority in [[Scotland]] (see [[John Knox]]), the [[Netherlands]] (see [[William Ames]], [[T. J. Frelinghuysen]] and [[Wilhelmus \u00e0 Brakel]]), some communities in [[Flanders]], and parts of Germany (especially these adjacent to the Netherlands) in the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], [[Kassel]] and [[Lippe]] with the likes of [[Olevianus]] and his colleague [[Zacharias Ursinus]]. In [[Hungary]] and the then-independent [[Transylvania]], Calvinism was a significant religion. In the 16th century, the Reformation gained many supporters in Eastern Hungary and Hungarian-populated regions in Transylvania. In these parts, the Reformed nobles protected the faith. Almost all Transylvanian dukes were Reformed.

People are not able to know anything about God except through this self-revelation. Speculation about anything which God has not revealed through his Word is not warranted. The knowledge people have of God is different from that which they have of anything else because God is [[Infinity of God|infinite]], and finite people are incapable of comprehending an infinite being. While the knowledge revealed by God to people is never incorrect, it is also never comprehensive.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=18\u201320}}\n\n[[File:Presbyterian Church in the United States of America no background.png|thumb|left|The seal of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]], an early American Presbyterian church]]\nAccording to Reformed theologians, God's self-revelation is always through his son [[Jesus Christ]], because Christ is the only mediator between God and people. Revelation of God through Christ comes through two basic channels. The first is [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] and [[Divine providence|providence]], which is God's creating and continuing to work in the world. This action of God gives everyone knowledge about God, but this knowledge is only sufficient to make people culpable for their sin; it does not include knowledge of the gospel. The second channel through which God reveals himself is [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]], which is the gospel of [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] from condemnation which is punishment for sin.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nIn Reformed theology, the Word of God takes several forms. Jesus Christ himself is the Word Incarnate. The prophecies about him said to be found in the [[Old Testament]] and the ministry of the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] who saw him and communicated his message are also the Word of God. Further, the [[preaching]] of ministers about God is the very Word of God because God is considered to be speaking through them. God also speaks through human writers in the [[Bible]], which is composed of texts set apart by God for self-revelation.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=24\u201325|}} Reformed theologians emphasize the Bible as a uniquely important means by which God communicates with people. People gain knowledge of God from the Bible which cannot be gained in any other way.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=12}}\n\nReformed theologians affirm that the Bible is true, but differences emerge among them over the meaning and extent of its truthfulness.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=28}} Conservative followers of the [[Princeton theologians]] take the view that the Bible is true and [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]], or incapable of error or falsehood, in every place.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=31}} This view is very similar to that of [[Catholic]] orthodoxy as well as modern [[Evangelicalism]].{{sfn|Farley|Hodgson|1994|p=77}} Another view, influenced by the teaching of [[Karl Barth]] and [[Neo-Orthodoxy]], is found in the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]]'s [[Confession of 1967]]. Those who take this view believe the Bible to be the primary source of our knowledge of God, but also that some parts of the Bible may be false, not witnesses to Christ, and not normative for today's church.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=31}} In this view, Christ is the revelation of God, and the scriptures witness to this revelation rather than being the revelation itself.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=20}} Dawn DeVries, a professor at [[Union Presbyterian Seminary]], has written that Barth's doctrine of Scripture is not capable of resolving conflicts in contemporary churches,{{sfn|DeVries|2003|p=295}} and proposed that Scripture not be thought of as the Word of God at all, but only human reports of the revealed Jesus Christ.{{sfn|DeVries|2003|p=309}}\n\n===Covenant===\n[[File:Jordaens Fall of man.jpg|thumb|''Fall of Man'' by [[Jacob Jordaens]]]]\n{{see also|Covenant theology}}\nReformed theologians use the concept of covenant to describe the way God enters fellowship with people in history.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=34\u201335}} The concept of covenant is so prominent in Reformed theology that  Reformed theology as a whole is sometimes called \"covenant theology\".{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=230 n. 28}} However, sixteenth and seventeenth-century theologians developed a particular theological system called \"[[covenant theology]]\" or \"federal theology\" which many conservative Reformed churches continue to affirm today.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=34{{ndash}}35}} This framework orders God's life with people primarily in two covenants: the covenant of works and the covenant of grace.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=44}} The covenant of works is made with [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]]. The terms of the covenant are that God provides a blessed life in the garden on condition that Adam and Eve obey God's law perfectly. Because Adam and Eve broke the covenant by eating the [[forbidden fruit]], they became subject to death and were banished from the garden. This sin was passed down to all mankind because all people are said to be in Adam as a covenantal or \"federal\" head. Federal theologians usually infer that Adam and Eve would have gained immortality had they obeyed perfectly.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=41{{ndash}}42}}\n\nA second covenant, called the covenant of grace, is said to have been made immediately following Adam and Eve's sin. In it, God graciously offers salvation from death on condition of faith in God. This covenant is administered in different ways throughout the Old and New Testaments, but retains the substance of being free of a requirement of perfect obedience.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=43}}\n\nThrough the influence of Karl Barth, many contemporary Reformed theologians have discarded the covenant of works, along with other concepts of federal theology. Barth saw the covenant of works as disconnected from Christ and the gospel, and rejected the idea that God works with people in this way. Instead, Barth argued that God always interacts with people under the covenant of grace, and that the covenant of grace is free of all conditions whatsoever. Barth's theology and that which follows him has been called \"monocovenantal\" as opposed to the \"bi-covenantal\" scheme of classical federal theology.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=48}} Conservative contemporary Reformed theologians, such as [[John Murray (theologian)|John Murray]], have also rejected the idea of covenants based on law rather than grace. [[Michael Horton (theologian)|Michael Horton]], however, has defended the covenant of works as combining principles of law and love.{{sfn|Horton|2011a|pp=420\u2013421}}\n\n===God===\n{{see also|God in Christianity|Trinity}}\nFor the most part, the Reformed tradition did not modify the medieval consensus on the [[doctrine of God]].{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=54}} God's character is described primarily using three adjectives: eternal, infinite, and unchangeable.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=55}} Reformed theologians such as [[Shirley Guthrie]] have proposed that rather than conceiving of God in terms of his attributes and freedom to do as he pleases, the doctrine of God is to be based on God's work in history and his freedom to live with and empower people.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=57\u201358}}\n\n[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|The \"[[Shield of the Trinity]]\" diagrams the classic doctrine of the [[Trinity]]]]\nTraditionally, Reformed theologians have also followed the medieval tradition going back to before the early church councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] and [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] on the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. God is affirmed to be one God in three persons: [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]], and [[Holy Spirit]]. The Son (Christ) is held to be eternally begotten by the Father and the [[Procession of the Holy Spirit|Holy Spirit eternally proceeding]] from the Father and Son.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=61\u201362}} However, contemporary theologians have been critical of aspects of Western views here as well. Drawing on the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] tradition, these Reformed theologians have proposed a \"[[social trinitarianism]]\" where the persons of the Trinity only exist in their life together as persons-in-relationship.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=61\u201362}} Contemporary Reformed confessions such as the [[Barmen Confession]] and Brief Statement of Faith of the Presbyterian Church (USA) have avoided language about the attributes of God and have emphasized his work of reconciliation and empowerment of people.{{sfn|Guthrie|2008|pp=32\u201333}} Feminist theologian [[Letty Russell]] used the image of partnership for the persons of the Trinity. According to Russell, thinking this way encourages Christians to interact in terms of fellowship rather than reciprocity.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=29}} Conservative Reformed theologian Michael Horton, however, has argued that social trinitarianism is untenable because it abandons the essential unity of God in favor of a community of separate beings.{{sfn|Horton|2011a|pp=298\u2013299}}\n\n===Christ and atonement===\n{{see also|Christ|Hypostatic union|Extra calvinisticum|Substitutionary atonement|Threefold office}}\nReformed theologians affirm the historic Christian belief that [[Christ]] is eternally [[hypostatic union|one person with a divine and a human nature]]. Reformed Christians have especially emphasized that Christ truly [[incarnation of Christ|became human]] so that people could be saved.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=82}} Christ's human nature has been a point of contention between Reformed and Lutheran [[Christology]]. In accord with the belief that finite humans cannot comprehend infinite divinity, Reformed theologians hold that Christ's human body cannot be in multiple locations at the same time. Because [[Lutheran]]s believe that Christ is bodily [[Real presence|present in the Eucharist]], they hold that Christ is bodily present in many locations simultaneously. For Reformed Christians, such a belief denies that Christ actually became human.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=65\u201366}} Some contemporary Reformed theologians have moved away from the traditional language of one person in two natures, viewing it as unintelligible to contemporary people. Instead, theologians tend to emphasize Jesus' context and particularity as a first-century Jew.{{sfn|Stroup|1993|p=142}}\n\n[[File:Allegorie van Christus als redder van de mensheid.jpg|thumb|This Dutch stained glass allegory shows Christ ascending the cross with Satan and several dead people on his back. Faith is personified as a woman to the right of a naked man on the ground asking Christ the way of salvation.]]\nJohn Calvin and many Reformed theologians who followed him describe Christ's work of redemption in terms of [[threefold office|three offices]]: [[prophet]], [[priest]], and [[Kingly office of Christ|king]]. Christ is said to be a prophet in that he teaches perfect doctrine, a priest in that [[intercession of Christ|he intercedes to the Father]] on believers' behalf and offered himself as a sacrifice for sin, and a king in that he rules the church and fights on believers' behalf. The threefold office links the work of Christ to God's work in [[ancient Israel]].{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=94}} Many, but not all, Reformed theologians continue to make use of the threefold office as a framework because of its emphasis on the connection of Christ's work to Israel. They have, however, often reinterpreted the meaning of each of the offices.{{sfn|Stroup|1993|p=156{{ndash}}157}} For example, Karl Barth interpreted Christ's prophetic office in terms of political engagement on behalf of the poor.{{sfn|Stroup|1993|p=164}}\n\nChristians believe [[Jesus' death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] makes it possible for believers to attain forgiveness for sin and reconciliation with God through the [[atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. Reformed Protestants generally subscribe to a particular view of the atonement called [[substitutionary atonement]], which explains Christ's death as a sacrificial payment for sin. Christ is believed to have died in place of the believer, who is accounted righteous as a result of this sacrificial payment.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=93}} Contemporary Reformed theologians such as [[William Placher]] and [[Nancy Duff]] have criticized this view, claiming it makes God appear abusive or vindictive and sanctions violence by the strong against the weak.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=222 n. 19}}\n\n===Sin===\n{{see also|Christian views on sin|Total depravity}}\nIn Christian theology, people are created good and in the [[image of God]] but have become corrupted by [[sin]], which causes them to be imperfect and overly self-interested.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=66}} Reformed Christians, following the tradition of [[Augustine of Hippo]], believe that this corruption of human nature was brought on by Adam and Eve's first sin, a doctrine called [[original sin]]. Reformed theologians emphasize that this sinfulness affects all of a person's nature, including their will. This view, that sin so dominates people that they are unable to avoid sin, has been called [[total depravity]].{{sfn|McKim|2001|pp=71\u201372}} In colloquial English, the term \"total depravity\" can be easily misunderstood to mean that people are absent of any goodness or unable to do any good. However the Reformed teaching is actually that while people continue to bear God's image and may do things that appear outwardly good, their sinful intentions affect all of their nature and actions so that they are not pleasing to God.<ref>{{cite book|title=Calvin and the Reformed Tradition|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|year=2012|location=Grand Rapids, MI|publisher=[[Baker Academic]]|p=51|edition=Ebook|authorlink=Richard A. Muller (theologian)}}</ref>\n\nSome contemporary theologians in the Reformed tradition, such as those associated with the PC(USA)'s Confession of 1967, have emphasized the social character of human sinfulness. These theologians have sought to bring attention to issues of environmental, economic, and political justice as areas of human life that have been affected by sin.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=73}}\n\n===Salvation===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Return of the Prodigal Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Return of the Prodigal Son]]'' by [[Rembrandt]], based on the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] illustrating forgiveness]]\n{{see also|Sola fide|Justification (theology)|Sanctification}}\nReformed theologians, along with other Protestants, believe salvation from punishment for sin is to be given to all those who have [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in Christ.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=77\u201378}} Faith is not purely intellectual, but involves trust in God's promise to save.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=114}} Protestants do not hold there to be any other requirement for salvation, but that [[faith alone]] is sufficient.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n[[Justification (theology)|Justification]] is the part of salvation where God pardons the sin of those who believe in Christ. It is historically held by Protestants to be the most important article of Christian faith, though more recently it is sometimes given less importance out of [[ecumenical]] concerns.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=80}} People are not on their own able even to fully [[repent]] of their sin or prepare themselves to repent because of their sinfulness. Therefore, justification is held to arise solely from God's free and gracious act.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=113}}\n\n[[Sanctification]] is the part of salvation in which God makes the believer holy, by enabling them to exercise greater love for God and for other people.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=84}} The [[good works]] accomplished by believers as they are sanctified are considered to be the necessary outworking of the believer's salvation, though they do not cause the believer to be saved.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=114}} Sanctification, like justification, is by faith, because doing good works is simply living as the son of God one has become.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=85}}\n\n===Predestination===\n{{main article|Predestination in Calvinism}}\nReformed theologians teach that sin so affects human nature that they are unable even to exercise faith in Christ by their own will. While people are said to retain will, in that they willfully sin, they are unable not to sin because of the corruption of their nature due to original sin. Reformed Christians believe that God [[predestination|predestined]] some people to be saved and others were predestined to eternal damnation<ref>{{cite book|last1=Calvin|first1=John|title=Institutes of the Christian Religion|date=1994|publisher=Eerdmans|page=2206|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes/Page_2206.html/}}</ref>. This [[unconditional election|choice by God to save some is held to be unconditional]] and not based on any characteristic or action on the part of the person chosen. This view is opposed to the [[Arminian]] view that God's [[conditional election|choice of whom to save is conditional]] or based on his foreknowledge of who would respond positively to God.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nKarl Barth reinterpreted the Reformed doctrine of predestination to apply only to Christ. Individual people are only said to be elected through their being in Christ.{{sfn|McKim|2001|pp=229\u2013230}} Reformed theologians who followed Barth, including [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]], David Migliore, and [[Shirley Guthrie]], have argued that the traditional Reformed concept of predestination is speculative and have proposed alternative models. These theologians claim that a properly trinitarian doctrine emphasizes God's freedom to love all people, rather than choosing some for salvation and others for damnation. God's justice towards and condemnation of sinful people is spoken of by these theologians as out of his love for them and a desire to reconcile them to himself.{{sfn|Guthrie|2008|pp=47\u201349}}\n\n====Five points of Calvinism====\n<!-- Note: Outside links (e.g., [[Five points of Calvinism]], [[TULIP]]) point to this section; do not delete or modify its name without addressing those links. -->\n{{TULIP}}\n\nMost objections to and attacks on Calvinism focus on the \"five points of Calvinism\", also called the doctrines of grace, and remembered by the [[mnemonic]] \"TULIP\".{{sfn|Horton|2011b|p=15}} The five points are popularly said to summarize the [[Canons of Dort]];<ref>{{cite book|last=Sproul|first=R C|authorlink=R.

People are not by nature inclined to love God, but rather to serve their own interests and to reject the rule of God. Thus, all people by their own faculties are morally unable to choose to trust God for their salvation and be saved (the term \"total\" in this context refers to sin affecting every part of a person, not that every person is as evil as they could be).<ref>{{cite book|first1=David|last1=Steele|first2=Curtis|last2=Thomas|title=The Five Points of Calvinism Defined, Defended, Documented|page=25|quote=The adjective 'total' does not mean that each sinner is as totally or completely corrupt in his actions and thoughts as it is possible for him to be.

Those not chosen receive the just wrath that is warranted for their sins against God.{{sfn |WCF|1646}}\n* \"[[Limited atonement]]\", also called \"particular redemption\" or \"definite atonement\", asserts that Jesus's [[substitutionary atonement]] was definite and certain in its purpose and in what it accomplished. This implies that only the sins of the elect were [[penal substitution|atoned]] for by Jesus's death. Calvinists do not believe, however, that the atonement is limited in its value or power, but rather that the atonement is limited in the sense that it is intended for some and not all. Some Calvinists have summarized this as \"The atonement is sufficient for all and efficient for the elect.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calvinistcorner.com/tulip.htm |title=The Five Points of Calvinism, TULIP |publisher=Calvinistcorner.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>\n* \"[[Irresistible grace]]\", also called \"efficacious grace\", asserts that the saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom he has determined to save (that is, the elect) and overcomes their resistance to obeying the call of the gospel, bringing them to a saving faith. This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved. The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's [[Holy Spirit]] cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, \"graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ.\"  This is not to deny the fact that the Spirit's outward call (through the proclamation of the Gospel) can be, and often is, rejected by sinners; rather, it is that inward call which cannot be rejected.\n* \"[[Perseverance of the saints]]\" (also known as \"perseverance of God with the saints\" and \"preservation of the believing\") (the word \"saints\" is used to refer to all who are set apart by God, and not of those who are exceptionally [[holy]], [[Canonization|canonized]], or in heaven) asserts that since God is sovereign and his will cannot be frustrated by humans or anything else, those whom God has called into communion with himself will continue in faith until the end. Those who apparently fall away either never had true faith to begin with (1 John 2:19), or, if they are saved but not presently walking in the Spirit, they will be divinely chastened (Hebrews 12:5\u201311) and will repent (1 John 3:6\u20139).<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/boettner/predest.iv.vi.html |chapter=The Perseverance of the Saints |title=The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination |author=[[Loraine Boettner]] }}</ref>\n\n====Comparison among Protestants====\n{{Comparison among Protestants}}\n\n===Church===\n{{see also|Protestant ecclesiology}}\nReformed Christians see the [[Christian Church]] as the community with which God has made the covenant of grace, a promise of eternal life and relationship with God.

For some, the only mark is the pure preaching of the gospel of Christ. Others, including John Calvin, also include the right administration of the [[sacrament]]s. Others, such as those following the [[Scots Confession]], include a third mark of rightly administered [[church discipline]], or exercise of censure against unrepentant sinners. These marks allowed the Reformed to identify the church based on its conformity to the Bible rather than the [[Magisterium]] or church tradition.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=126}}\n\n===Worship===\n{{main article|Reformed worship}}\n\n====Regulative principle of worship====\n{{Main article|Regulative principle of worship}}\n[[File:Bay1640.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Bay Psalm Book]] was used by the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].]]\n\nThe regulative principle of worship is a teaching shared by some Calvinists and Anabaptists on how the Bible orders public worship. The substance of the doctrine regarding worship is that God institutes in the Scriptures everything he requires for worship in the Church and that everything else is prohibited. As the regulative principle is reflected in Calvin's own thought, it is driven by his evident antipathy toward the Roman Catholic Church and its worship practices, and it associates musical instruments with [[icon]]s, which he considered violations of the [[Ten Commandments]]' prohibition of graven images.<ref name=\"Barber\">{{cite journal |url=http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/joh_barber/PT.joh_barber.Luther.Calvin.Music.Worship.html |journal=Reformed Perspectives Magazine |volume=8 |issue=26 |date=25 June 2006 |title=Luther and Calvin on Music and Worship |author=John Barber |accessdate=2008-05-06}}</ref>\n\nOn this basis, many early Calvinists also eschewed musical instruments and advocated [[a cappella]] [[exclusive psalmody]] in worship,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/music.htm |accessdate=2007-11-16 |year=1998 |title= Musical Instruments in the Public Worship of God |author=Brian Schwertley}}</ref> though Calvin himself allowed other scriptural songs as well as psalms,<ref name=\"Barber\" /> and this practice typified [[presbyterian worship]] and the worship of other Reformed churches for some time.

Despite the protestations of those who hold to a strict view of the regulative principle, today [[hymn]]s and musical instruments are in common use, as are [[contemporary worship music]] styles with elements such as [[worship band]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author=John Frame |title=Worship in Spirit and Truth |year=1996 |isbn=0-87552-242-4 |publisher=P&R Pub. |location=Phillipsburg, NJ}}</ref>\n\n===Sacraments===\n{{see also|Sacraments#Reformed teaching|l1=Reformed teaching on sacraments|Reformed baptismal theology|Lord's Supper in Reformed theology}}\nThe [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] limits the sacraments to baptism and the Lord's Supper.

The former view, sometimes called \"high Calvinism\", argues that the Fall occurred partly to facilitate God's purpose to choose some individuals for salvation and some for damnation. Infralapsarianism, sometimes called \"low Calvinism\", is the position that, while the Fall was indeed planned, it was not planned with reference to who would be saved.\n\nSupralapsarians believe that God chose which individuals to save logically prior to the decision to allow the race to fall and that the Fall serves as the means of realization of that prior decision to send some individuals to hell and others to heaven (that is, it provides the grounds of condemnation in the reprobate and the need for salvation in the elect). In contrast, infralapsarians hold that God planned the race to fall logically prior to the decision to save or damn any individuals because, it is argued, in order to be \"saved\", one must first need to be saved from something and therefore the decree of the Fall must precede predestination to salvation or damnation.\n\nThese two views vied with each other at the Synod of Dort, an international body representing Calvinist Christian churches from around Europe, and the judgments that came out of that council sided with infralapsarianism (Canons of Dort, First Point of Doctrine, Article 7).

After the successful fight for independence from Spain (1579), the Netherlands, under Calvinist leadership, became the freest country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, e.g. French [[Huguenot]]s, English [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] ([[Congregationalists]]), and [[Jews]] from Spain and Portugal. The ancestors of philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] were Portuguese Jews.

The Huguenots added [[synod]]s whose members were also elected by the congregations. The other Reformed churches took over this system of church self-government which was essentially a representative democracy.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', p. 325</ref> [[Baptists]], [[Quakers]], and [[Methodists]] are organized in a similar way.

He appreciated the advantages of democracy.<ref>Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', 3.

In order to minimize the misuse of political power he suggested dividing it among several institutions in a system of checks and balances ([[separation of powers]]). Finally, Calvin taught that if worldly rulers rise up against God they should be put down. In this way, he and his followers stood in the vanguard of resistance to political [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and furthered the cause of democracy.<ref>Clifton E.

A countable set is either a [[finite set]] or a '''countably infinite''' set. Whether finite or infinite, the elements of a countable set can always be counted one at a time and, although the counting may never finish, every element of the set is associated with a unique natural number.\n\nSome authors use countable set to mean ''countably infinite'' alone.<ref name=\"Rudin\">{{Harvnb|Rudin|1976|loc=Chapter 2}}</ref> To avoid this ambiguity, the term ''at most countable'' may be used when finite sets are included and ''countably infinite'', ''enumerable'',<ref>{{harvnb|Kamke|1950|page=2}}</ref> or ''denumerable''<ref name=\"Lang\">{{Harvnb|Lang|1993|loc=&sect;2 of Chapter I}}</ref> otherwise.\n\n[[Georg Cantor]] introduced the term ''countable set'', contrasting sets that are countable with those that are ''[[uncountable set|uncountable]]'' (i.e., ''nonenumerable'' or ''nondenumerable''<ref name=\"Apostol\">{{Harvnb|Apostol|1969|loc=Chapter 13.19}}</ref>). Today, countable sets form the foundation of a branch of mathematics called ''[[discrete mathematics]]''.\n\n==Definition==\nA set {{mvar|S}} is ''countable'' if there exists an [[injective function]] {{mvar|f}} from {{mvar|S}} to the [[natural numbers]] {{math|1='''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}}}.<ref>Since there is an obvious [[bijection]] between {{math|'''N'''}} and {{math|1='''N'''* = {1, 2, 3, ...}}}, it makes no difference whether one considers 0  a natural number or not. In any case, this article follows [[ISO 31-11]] and the standard convention in [[mathematical logic]], which takes 0 as a natural number.</ref>\n\nIf such an  {{mvar|f}} can be found that is also [[surjective function|surjective]] (and therefore [[bijection|bijective]]), then {{mvar|S}} is called ''countably [[infinite set|infinite]].''\n\nIn other words, a set is ''countably infinite'' if it has [[One-one correspondence|one-to-one correspondence]] with the natural number set, {{math|'''N'''}}.\n\nAs noted above, this terminology is not universal. Some authors use countable to mean what is here called ''countably infinite,'' and do not include finite sets.\n\nAlternative (equivalent) formulations of the definition in terms of a [[bijective]] function or a [[surjective]] function can also be given. See below.\n\n==History==\nIn 1874, in [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|his first set theory article]], Cantor proved that the set of [[real number]]s is uncountable, thus showing that not all infinite sets are countable.<ref>{{citation|title=Roads to Infinity: The Mathematics of Truth and Proof|first=John C.|last=Stillwell|authorlink=John Stillwell|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781439865507|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvPRBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|quote=Cantor's discovery of uncountable sets in 1874 was one of the most unexpected events in the history of mathematics. Before 1874, infinity was not even considered a legitimate mathematical subject by most people, so the need to distinguish between countable and uncountable infinities could not have been imagined.}}</ref> In 1878, he used one-to-one correspondences to define and compare cardinalities.<ref>Cantor 1878, p.&nbsp;242.</ref> In 1883, he extended the natural numbers with his infinite [[ordinal number|ordinals]], and used sets of ordinals to produce an infinity of sets having different infinite cardinalities.<ref>Ferreir\u00f3s 2007, pp. 268, 272&ndash;273.</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nA ''[[Set (mathematics)|set]]'' is a collection of ''elements'', and may be described in many ways. One way is simply to list all of its elements; for example, the set consisting of the integers 3, 4, and 5 may be denoted {3, 4, 5}. This is only effective for small sets, however; for larger sets, this would be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead of listing every single element, sometimes an ellipsis (\"...\") is used, if the writer believes that the reader can easily guess what is missing; for example, {1, 2, 3, ..., 100} presumably denotes the set of [[integer]]s from 1 to 100. Even in this case, however, it is still ''possible'' to list all the elements, because the set is ''finite''.\n\nSome sets are ''infinite''; these sets have more than ''n'' elements for any integer ''n''. For example, the set of natural numbers, denotable by {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}, has infinitely many elements, and we cannot use any normal number to give its size. Nonetheless, it turns out that infinite sets do have a well-defined notion of size (or more properly, of ''cardinality'', which is the technical term for the number of elements in a set), and not all infinite sets have the same cardinality.\n\n[[File:Aplicaci\u00f3n 2 inyectiva sobreyectiva02.svg|thumb|x100px|Bijective mapping from integer to even numbers]]\nTo understand what this means, we first examine what it ''does not'' mean. For example, there are infinitely many odd integers, infinitely many even integers, and (hence) infinitely many integers overall. However, it turns out that the number of even integers, which is the same as the number of odd integers, is also the same as the number of integers overall. This is because we arrange things such that for every integer, there is a distinct even integer: ... \u22122\u2192\u22124, \u22121\u2192\u22122, 0\u21920, 1\u21922, 2\u21924, ...; or, more generally, ''n''\u21922''n'', see picture. What we have done here is arranged the integers and the even integers into a ''one-to-one correspondence'' (or ''[[bijection]]''), which is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that maps between two sets such that each element of each set corresponds to a single element in the other set.\n\nHowever, not all infinite sets have the same cardinality. For example, [[Georg Cantor]] (who introduced this concept) demonstrated that the real numbers cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (non-negative integers), and therefore that the set of real numbers has a greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers.\n\nA set is ''countable'' if: (1) it is finite, or (2) it has the same cardinality (size) as the set of natural numbers. Equivalently, a set is ''countable'' if it has the same cardinality as some [[subset]] of the set of natural numbers. Otherwise, it is ''uncountable''.\n\n==Formal overview without details==\nBy definition a set ''S'' is ''countable'' if there exists an [[injective function]] ''f'' : ''S'' \u2192 '''N''' from ''S'' to the [[natural numbers]] '''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.\n\nIt might seem natural to divide the sets into different classes: put all the sets containing one element together; all the sets containing two elements together; ...; finally, put together all infinite sets and consider them as having the same size.\nThis view is not tenable, however, under the natural definition of size.\n\nTo elaborate this we need the concept of a [[bijection]]. Although a \"bijection\" seems a more advanced concept than a number, the usual development of mathematics in terms of set theory defines functions before numbers, as they are based on much simpler sets. This is where the concept of a bijection comes in: define the correspondence\n\n:''a'' \u2194 1, ''b'' \u2194 2, ''c'' \u2194 3\n\nSince every element of {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} is paired with ''precisely one'' element of {1, 2, 3}, ''and'' vice versa, this defines a bijection.\n\nWe now generalize this situation and ''define'' two sets as of the same size if (and only if) there is a bijection between them. For all finite sets this gives us the usual definition of \"the same size\". What does it tell us about the size of infinite sets?\n\nConsider the sets ''A'' = {1, 2, 3, ... }, the set of positive [[integer]]s and ''B'' = {2, 4, 6, ... }, the set of even positive integers. We claim that, under our definition, these sets have the same size, and that therefore ''B'' is countably infinite. Recall that to prove this we need to exhibit a bijection between them. But this is easy, using ''n'' \u2194 2''n'', so that\n:1 \u2194 2, 2 \u2194 4, 3 \u2194 6, 4 \u2194 8, ....\n\nAs in the earlier example, every element of A has been paired off with precisely one element of B, and vice versa. Hence they have the same size. This is an example of a set of the same size as one of its proper subsets, which is impossible for finite sets.\n\nLikewise, the set of all [[ordered pair]]s of natural numbers is countably infinite, as can be seen by following a path like the one in the picture: [[File:Pairing natural.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Cantor pairing function]] assigns one natural number to each pair of natural numbers]] The resulting mapping is like this:\n:0 \u2194 (0,0), 1 \u2194 (1,0), 2 \u2194 (0,1), 3 \u2194 (2,0), 4 \u2194 (1,1), 5 \u2194 (0,2), 6 \u2194 (3,0) ....\nThis mapping covers all such ordered pairs.\n\nIf you treat each pair as being the [[numerator]] and [[denominator]] of a [[vulgar fraction]], then for every positive fraction, we can come up with a distinct number corresponding to it. This representation includes also the natural numbers, since every natural number is also a fraction ''N''/1. So we can conclude that there are exactly as many positive rational numbers as there are positive integers. This is true also for all rational numbers, as can be seen below.\n\n'''Theorem:''' The [[Cartesian product]] of finitely many countable sets is countable.\n\nThis form of triangular [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] [[recursion|recursively]] generalizes to [[vector space|vectors]] of finitely many natural numbers by repeatedly mapping the first two elements to a natural number. For example, (0,2,3) maps to (5,3), which maps to 39.\n\nSometimes more than one mapping is useful. This is where you map the set you want to show is countably infinite onto another set\u2014and then map this other set to the natural numbers. For example, the positive [[rational number]]s can easily be mapped to (a subset of) the pairs of natural numbers because ''p''/''q ''maps to (''p'', ''q'').\n\nWhat about infinite subsets of countably infinite sets? Do these have fewer elements than '''N'''?\n\n'''Theorem:''' Every subset of a countable set is countable.

The [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] can be used to show that this minimal model is countable. The fact that the notion of \"uncountability\" makes sense even in this model, and in particular that this model ''M'' contains elements that are:\n* subsets of ''M'', hence countable,\n* but uncountable from the point of view of ''M'',\nwas seen as paradoxical in the early days of set theory, see [[Skolem's paradox]].\n\nThe minimal standard model includes all the [[algebraic number]]s and all effectively computable [[transcendental number]]s, as well as many other kinds of numbers.\n\n==Total orders==\nCountable sets can be [[total order|totally ordered]] in various ways, e.g.:\n*[[Well-order]]s (see also [[ordinal number]]):\n**The usual order of natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...)\n**The integers in the order (0, 1, 2, 3, ...; \u22121, \u22122, \u22123, ...)\n*Other (''not'' well orders):\n**The usual order of integers (..., \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)\n**The usual order of rational numbers (Cannot be explicitly written as an ordered list!)\n\nNote that in both examples of well orders here, any subset has a ''least element''; and in both examples of non-well orders, ''some'' subsets do not have a ''least element''.\nThis is the key definition that determines whether a total order is also a well order.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aleph number]]\n* [[Counting]]\n* [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]\n* [[Uncountable set]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | first1=Tom M. | last1=Apostol | author-link = Tom M.

This procedure, often known as ''the sequence rules'', is the heart of the CIP system.\n#Compare the [[atomic number]] (''Z'') of the atoms directly attached to the stereocenter; the group having the atom of higher atomic number receives higher priority.\n#If there is a tie, we must consider the atoms at distance 2 from the stereocenter\u2014as a list is made for each group of the atoms bonded to the one directly attached to the stereocenter. Each list is arranged in order of decreasing atomic number. Then the lists are compared atom by atom; at the earliest difference, the group containing the atom of higher atomic number receives higher priority.\n#If there is still a tie, each atom in each of the two lists is replaced with a sublist of the other atoms bonded to it (at distance 3 from the stereocenter), the sublists are arranged in decreasing order of atomic number, and the entire structure is again compared atom by atom. This process is repeated recursively, each time with atoms one bond farther from the stereocenter, until the tie is broken.\n\n====Isotopes====\nIf two groups differ only in [[isotope]]s, [[atomic mass]]es are used at each step to break ties in atomic number.\n\n====Double and triple bonds====\n[[File:Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Double Bond.png|thumb|This example showcases the \"divide and duplicate rule\" for double bonds. The vinyl group (C=C) or alkene portion has a higher priority over the alkane (C\u2212C) portion.]]\nIf an atom A is double-bonded to an atom B, A is treated as being singly bonded to two atoms: B and a \"ghost atom\" that is a duplicate of B (has the same atomic number) but is not attached to anything except A. When B is replaced with a list of attached atoms, A itself, but not its \"ghost\", is excluded in accordance with the general principle of not doubling back along a bond that has just been followed. A triple bond is handled the same way except that A and B are each connected to two ghost atoms of the other.<ref name=\"IUPAC\" />{{Rp|28}}\n\n==== Geometric isomers ====\nIf two substituents on an atom are [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|geometric isomers]] of each other, the ''Z''-isomer has higher priority than the ''E''-isomer.\n\n====Cyclic molecules====\nTo handle a molecule containing one or more [[Cyclic molecule|cycles]], one must first expand it into a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] (called a '''hierarchical digraph''') by traversing bonds in all possible paths starting at the stereocenter. When the traversal encounters an atom through which the current path has already passed, a ghost atom is generated in order to keep the tree finite. A single atom of the original molecule may appear in many places (some as ghosts, some not) in the tree.<ref name=\"ciprev1982\">{{cite journal |last1=Prelog |first1=Vladlmir |last2=Helmchen |first2=Guenter |title=Basic Principles of the CIP-System and Proposals for a Revision |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English |date=August 1982 |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=567\u2013583 |doi=10.1002/anie.198205671 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}</ref>{{rp|at=3}}\n\n=== Assigning descriptors ===\n\n==== Stereocenters: ''R''/''S'' ====\n[[File:CIP system example.svg|thumb|Two examples of stereocenters.

If the substituents are numbered from 1 (highest priority) to 4 (lowest priority), then the sense of rotation of a curve passing through 1, 2 and 3 distinguishes the [[stereoisomer]]s. A center with a clockwise sense of rotation is an ''R'' (''rectus'') center and a center with a counterclockwise sense of rotation is an ''S'' (''sinister'') center.

If the thumb points in the direction of the fourth substituent, the enantiomer is ''R''; otherwise, it is ''S''.\n\nIt is possible in rare cases that two substituents on an atom differ only in their absolute configuration (''R'' or ''S''). If the relative priorities of these substituents need to be established, ''R'' takes priority over ''S''. When this happens, the descriptor of the stereocenter is a lowercase letter (''r'' or ''s'') instead of the uppercase letter normally used.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=pseudo-asymmetric carbon atom|file=P04921}}</ref>\n\n==== Double bonds: ''E''/''Z'' ====\n{{Main article|E-Z notation}}\n\nFor alkenes and similar double bonded molecules, the same prioritizing process is followed for the substituents. In this case, it is the placing of the two highest priority substituents with respect to the double bond which matters. If both high priority substituents are on the same side of the double bond, i.e. in the [[Cis-trans isomerism|''cis'' configuration]], then the [[stereoisomer]] is assigned a ''Z'' (''zusammen'') . If by contrast they are in a [[Cis-trans isomerism|''trans'' configuration]], then the stereoisomer is assigned an ''E'' (''entgegen''). In this case the identifying letters are derived from [[German language|German]] for 'together' and 'opposite', respectively.\n\n=== Examples ===\nThe following are examples of application of the nomenclature.<ref name=\"HartHadad2011\">{{cite book|author1=Harold Hart|author2=Christopher M.

The priorities are assigned based on [[atomic number]] (''Z''): [[iodine]] (''Z'' = 53) > [[bromine]] (''Z'' = 35) > [[chlorine]] (''Z'' = 17) > [[fluorine]] (''Z'' = 9). Allowing fluorine (lowest priority) to point away from the viewer the rotation is clockwise hence the ''R'' assignment.\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"| [[File:L-serine-skeletal.png|center|120px]]\n| bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" valign=\"top\" | In the assignment of [[L-Serine|<small>L</small>-serine]] highest priority is given to the [[nitrogen]] atom (''Z'' = 7) in the [[amino group]] (NH<sub>2</sub>). Both the [[hydroxymethyl]] group (CH<sub>2</sub>OH) and the [[carboxylic acid]] group (COOH) have carbon atoms (''Z'' = 6) but priority is given to the latter because the carbon atom in the COOH group is connected to a second oxygen (''Z'' = 8) whereas in the CH<sub>2</sub>OH group [[carbon]] is connected to a [[hydrogen]] atom (''Z'' = 1). Lowest priority is given to the hydrogen atom and as this atom points away from the viewer the counterclockwise decrease in priority over the three remaining substituents completes the assignment as ''S''.  \n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"| [[File:(S)-Carvone.svg|center|80px]]\n|bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" valign=top| The stereocenter in [[Carvone|(''S'')-carvone]] is connected to one hydrogen atom (not shown, priority 4) and three carbon atoms. The [[isopropene|isopropenyl]] group has priority 1 (carbon atoms only) and for the two remaining carbon atoms priority is decided with the carbon atoms two bonds removed from the stereocenter, one part of the [[ketone|keto]] group (O, O, C, priority 2) and one part of an alkene (C, C, H, priority 3). The resulting counterclockwise rotation results in ''S''.\n|}\n\n== Describing multiple centers ==\nIf a compound has more than one stereocenter each center is denoted by either ''R'' or ''S''. For example, [[ephedrine]] exists with both (1''R'',2''S'') and (1''S'',2''R'') configuration, known as [[enantiomer]]s. This compound also exists with a (1''R'',2''R'') and (1''S'',2''S'') configuration. The last two stereoisomers are not ephedrine, but [[pseudoephedrine]]. All isomers are 2-methylamino-1-phenyl-1-propanol in systematic nomenclature. Pseudoephedrine is chemically distinct from ephedrine with only the three-dimensional configuration in space, as notated by the Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog rules. The two compounds, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, are [[diastereomers]], or stereoisomers that are not enantiomers. They have different names because, as diastereomers, they have different chemical properties.\n\nIn pairs of enantiomers, all descriptors are opposite: (''R'',''R'') and (''S'',''S''), or (''R'',''S'') and (''S'',''R''). Diastereomers have one descriptor in common: (''R'',''S'') and (''R'',''R''), or (''S'',''R'') and (''S'',''S''). This holds true for compounds with more than two stereocenters; if at least one descriptor is the same in both pairs, the compounds are diastereomers. If all the stereocenters are opposite, they are enantiomers.\n\n== Relative configuration ==\nThe relative configuration of two [[stereoisomer]]s may be denoted by the descriptors ''R'' and ''S'' with an [[asterisk]] (*). (''R''*,''R''*) means two centers having identical configurations, (''R'',''R'') or (''S'',''S''); (''R''*,''S''*) means two centers having opposite configurations, (''R'',''S'') or (''S'',''R''). To begin, the lowest-numbered (according to IUPAC systematic numbering) stereogenic center is given the ''R''* descriptor.\n\nTo designate two [[anomer]]s the relative stereodescriptors alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) are used. In the \u03b1 anomer the ''anomeric carbon atom'' and the ''reference atom'' do have opposite configurations (''R'',''S'') or (''S'',''R''), whereas in the \u03b2 anomer they are the same (''R'',''R'') or (''S'',''S'').<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=Relative Configuration|file=R05260}}</ref>\n\n== Faces ==\n[[Image:RefaceAndSiFace.png|400px|thumb|right|[[Acetophenone]] and [[\u03b1-phenylethanol]]]]\nStereochemistry also plays a role assigning ''faces'' to trigonal molecules such as [[ketone]]s. A [[nucleophile]] in a [[nucleophilic addition]] can approach the [[carbonyl]] group from two opposite sides or faces. When an achiral nucleophile attacks [[acetone]], both faces are identical and there is only one reaction product. When the nucleophile attacks [[butanone]], the faces are not identical (''[[enantiotopic]]'') and a [[Racemic mixture|racemic product]] results. When the nucleophile is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] molecule [[diastereoisomer]]s are formed. When one face of a molecule is shielded by substituents or geometric constraints compared to the other face the faces are called [[diastereotopic]]. The same rules that determine the stereochemistry of a stereocenter (''R'' or ''S'') also apply when assigning the face of a molecular group. The faces are then called the '''''Re''-face''' and '''''Si''-face'''. In the example displayed on the right, the compound [[acetophenone]] is viewed from the ''Re''-face. Hydride addition as in a reduction process from this side will form the (''S'')-enantiomer and attack from the opposite ''Si''-face will give the (''R'')-enantiomer.  However, one should note that adding a chemical group to the prochiral center from the ''Re''-face will not always lead to an (''S'')-stereocenter, as the priority of the chemical group has to be taken into account. That is, the absolute stereochemistry of the product is determined on its own and not by considering which face it was attacked from.  In the above-mentioned example, if [[chloride]] (''Z'' = 17) was added to the prochiral center from the ''Re''-face, this would result in an (''R'')-enantiomer.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Navbox stereochemistry}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priority Rules}}\n[[Category:Chemical nomenclature]]\n[[Category:Stereochemistry]]", "sha1": "bsjcvgb7di2thg2f9l6z8gppodbrqn5"}}, {"title": "Celibacy", "ns": "0", "id": "6035", "revision": {"id": "864026087", "parentid": "863494012", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T16:52:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "BD2412", "id": "196446"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Augustinian view */clean up spacing around commas, replaced: ,i \u2192 , i", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n[[File:KateriTekakwitha.jpg|thumb|Saint [[Kateri Tekakwitha]], a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[laywoman]] who took a private vow of perpetual virginity]]\n'''Celibacy''' (from [[Latin]], ''c\u00e6libatus\"'') is the state of voluntarily being unmarried, [[Sexual abstinence|sexually abstinent]],<!--NOTE: Sources differ on the and/or matter -- whether celibacy is both unmarried and sexually abstinent, or one or the other; this line follows the sources with WP:Due weight, and the WP:ANDOR guideline. --> or both, usually for religious reasons.<ref name=\"O'Brien\">{{cite book |first=Jodi|last= O'Brien| title = Encyclopedia of Gender and Society, Volume 1| publisher =[[Sage Publications|SAGE]]|year = 2009|pages=118\u2013119|accessdate = January 11, 2014| isbn = 1412909163 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=_nyHS4WyUKEC&pg=PT150}}</ref><ref name=\"Celibate\">{{cite web|title=Celibate|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=January 11, 2014|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/celibate}}</ref><ref name=\"Celibacy\">{{cite web|title=Celibacy|publisher=''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]''|accessdate=January 11, 2014|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Celibacy}}</ref><ref name=\"Celibacy2\">{{cite web|title=Celibacy|publisher=[[Reference.com]]|accessdate=January 11, 2014|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/celibacy}}</ref> It is often in association with the role of a religious official or devotee.<ref name=\"O'Brien\"/> In its narrow sense, the term ''celibacy'' is applied only to those for whom the unmarried state is the result of a sacred [[vow]], act of renunciation, or religious conviction.<ref name=\"O'Brien\"/><ref name=\"Garner2009\">{{cite book |author=Bryan Garner|title=Garner's Modern American Usage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FwmQpyibKkAC&pg=PA145|date=28 July 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988877-1|page=145}}</ref> In a wider sense, it is commonly understood to only mean abstinence from [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].<ref name=\"O'Brien\"/><ref name=\"Garner2009\"/>\n\nCelibacy has existed in one form or another throughout history, in virtually all the major religions of the world, and views on it have varied.

The [[Islamic]] attitudes toward celibacy have been complex as well; Some Hadiths claimed that Muhammad denounced, but some [[Sufi]] orders embrace it.\n\nClassical [[Hindu]] culture encouraged asceticism and celibacy in the later stages of life, after one has met his societal obligations. [[Jainism]], on the other hand, preached complete celibacy even for young monks and considered celibacy to be an essential behavior to attain [[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]].\n[[Buddhism]] has been influenced by Jainism in this respect. There were, however, significant cultural differences in the various areas where Buddhism spread, which affected the local attitudes toward celibacy.

Celibacy was advocated as an ideal rule of life for all [[Bhikkhu|monk]]s and [[Bhikkhuni|nun]]s by [[Gautama Buddha]], except for Japan where it is not strictly followed due to historical and political developments following the [[Meiji Restoration]]. In Japan, celibacy was an ideal among Buddhist clerics for hundreds of years. But violations of clerical celibacy were so common for so long that, finally, in 1872, state laws made marriage legal for Buddhist clerics. Subsequently, ninety percent of Buddhist monks/clerics married.<ref>Richard M. 2001. Neither Monk nor Layman: Clerical Marriage in Modern Japanese Buddhism. New Jersey: Princeton University Press, p. 4</ref> An example is [[Higashifushimi Kunihide]], a prominent Buddhist priest of Japanese royal ancestry who was married and a father whilst serving as a monk for most of his lifetime.\n\nGautama, later known as the Buddha, is known for his renunciation of his wife, Princess [[Yasodhar\u0101]], and son, [[Rahula]]. In order to pursue an ascetic life, he needed to renounce aspects of the impermanent world, including his wife and son. Later on both his wife and son joined the ascetic community and are mentioned in the Buddhist texts to have become enlightened. In another sense, a [[buddhavacana]] recorded the zen patriarch [[Vimalakirti]] as being an advocate of [[Sexual abstinence|marital continence]] instead of monastic renunciation, the sutra became somewhat popular due to its brash humour as well as integrating the role of women in laity as well as spiritual life.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thurman|first1=Robert A.

It is said that, as per the direction of the Supreme God those lead a pure and celibate life will be successfully able to conquer the surging vices. The power of celibacy creates an unseen environment of divinity bringing peace, power, purity, prosperity and fortune. Those with the power of celibacy are eligible to claim a bright future of Golden Age of heaven / Paradise. Brahma Kumaris' concept of identifying the self as a soul, different from physical body, is deeply linked to the philosophy of celibacy. It is said that the craving for sex and impure thoughts are the reason for the whole trouble in the universe today. And celibacy is to lead the pure relationship in one's life.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Christianity==\n[[File:Saint Jean-Baptiste au d\u00e9sert, Rapha\u00ebl (Louvre INV 606) 01.jpg|thumb|''St. John the Baptist in the Wilderness'' by [[Raphael]], circa 1517]]\n[[File:Walking russian orthodox nuns and monk Isreal.JPG|thumb|A Russian orthodox nun and monk in the Old City of Jerusalem, 2012]]\n\nWhen Jesus discusses marriage, he points out that there is some responsibility for a man marrying a woman (and<!-- for sure discussed (or only implied?): --> vice versa).

By the time of Anthony's death, there were so many men and women living in the desert in celibacy that it was described as \"a city\" by Anthony's biographer.<ref name=\"Chryssavgis15\" /> The first Conciliar document on celibacy of the Western Christian Church (Canon 33 of the [[Synod of Elvira]], {{circa|AD&nbsp;305}}) states that the discipline of celibacy is to refrain from the ''use'' of marriage, i.e. refrain from having carnal contact with your spouse.<ref>Roman Cholij ''Clerical Celibacy in East and West''.

Celibacy excludes not only libidinous acts, but also sinful thoughts or desires of the flesh.<ref>art. Celibacy, clerical, in ''Dictionary of Moral Theology''. Compiled under the Direction of H. E.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] was one of the first to develop a theory that sexual feelings were sinful and negative. Augustine taught that the original sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of ''foolishness'' (''insipientia'') followed by ''pride'' and ''disobedience'' to God, or else inspired by pride.<ref>He explained to Julian of Eclanum that it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit''.

I suppose, in order that it may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is, seek to be regulated according to its own nature, viz., under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled, above those things which it ought to rule. For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more.\" (\"[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130105.htm On the Trinity]\" (''De Trinitate''), 5:7; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 320 [1\u201312])</ref> They would not have fallen into pride and lack of wisdom, if Satan hadn't sown into their senses \"the root of evil\" (''radix Mali'').<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus'' (\"Contra Julianum\", I, 9.42; PL 44, 670)</ref> Their nature was wounded by [[concupiscence]] or [[libido]], which affected human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire.<ref>In one of Augustine's late works, ''Retractationes'', he made a significant remark indicating the way he understood difference between spiritual, moral libido and the sexual desire: \"Libido is not good and righteous use of the libido\" (\"libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis\"). See the whole passage: ''Dixi etiam quodam loco: \u00abQuod enim est cibus ad salutem hominis, hoc est concubitus ad salutem generis, et utrumque non est sine delectatione carnali, quae tamen modificata et temperantia refrenante in usum naturalem redacta, libido esse non potest\u00bb.

Celibacy, termed ''[[brahmacharya]]'' in Vedic scripture, is the fourth of the ''[[yamas]]'' and the word literally translated means \"dedicated to the Divinity of Life\". The word is often used in yogic practice to refer to celibacy or denying pleasure, but this is only a small part of what ''brahmacharya'' represents. The purpose of practicing ''brahmacharya'' is to keep a person focused on the purpose in life, the things that instill a feeling of peace and contentment.\n\n==Islam==\n{{See also|Nikah}}\nIslamic attitudes toward celibacy have been complex, Muhammad denounced it, however some [[Sufi]] orders embrace it. Islam does not promote celibacy; rather it condemns [[premarital sex]] and [[extramarital sex]]. In fact, according to Islam, marriage enables one to attain the highest form of righteousness within this sacred spiritual bond and is as such to be sought after and desired. It disagrees with the concept that marriage acts as a form of distraction in attaining nearness to God. The [[Qur'an]] (57:27) states, \"But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them but only to please God therewith, but that they did not observe it with the right observance.\"\n\nThe following sayings about the Prophet also address celibacy:\n\n\"There have been people who have come to the prophet and explained how they love to be engaged in prayer and fasting for the sake of God. The Prophet Mohammed told them that, despite this being good, it is also a blessing to raise a family, to remain moderate and not to concentrate too much on one aspect as not only can this be unhealthy for an individual as well as upon society, it may also take one away from God.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nCelibacy appears as a peculiarity among some Sufis.<ref>{{cite

The usual reason for this arrangement is that no party on its own can achieve a majority in the [[parliament]]. A coalition government might also be created in a time of nationals difficulty or crisis (for example, during wartime or economic crisis) to give a government the high degree of perceived [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] or [[collective identity]] it desires while also playing a role in diminishing internal political strife. In such times, parties have formed '''all-party coalitions''' ([[national unity government]]s, [[grand coalition]]s). If a coalition collapses, a [[Motion of Confidence|confidence vote]] is held or a [[motion of no confidence]] is taken.\n\n==Practice==\n{{Original research section|date=June 2009}}\nWhen a general election does not produce a clear majority for a single party, parties either form coalition cabinets, supported by a parliamentary majority, or [[Minority government|minority cabinets]] which may consist of one or more parties. Cabinets based on a group of parties that command a majority in parliament tend to be more stable and long-lived than minority cabinets. While the former are prone to internal struggles, they have less reason to fear votes of no confidence. [[Majority government]]s based on a single party are typically even more stable, as long as their majority can be maintained.\n\n==Distribution==\n{{see also|List of countries with coalition governments}}\nCountries which often operate with coalition cabinets include: the [[Nordic countries]], the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kosovo]], [[Latvia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]]. [[Switzerland]] has been ruled by a coalition of the four strongest parties in parliament from 1959 to 2008, called the \"[[Magic Formula]]\". Between 2010 and 2015, the [[United Kingdom]] also operated a formal coalition between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] parties, but this was unusual: the UK usually has a single-party majority government.\n\n===Coalitions composed of few parties===\n{{Party politics}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\n\n{{see also|National Government (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom coalition government (disambiguation)}}\nIn the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], coalition governments (sometimes known as \"national governments\") usually have only been formed at times of national crisis. The most prominent was the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] of 1931 to 1940. There were multi-party coalitions during both [[world war]]s. Apart from this, when no party has had a majority, minority governments normally have been formed with one or more opposition parties agreeing to vote in favour of the legislation which governments need to function: for instance the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[James Callaghan]] came to an agreement with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] in 1977 when it lost the narrow majority it had gained in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 election]]. However, in the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], Labour opposition leader [[Tony Blair]] was in talks with [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader [[Paddy Ashdown]] about forming a coalition government if Labour failed to win a majority at the election; but there proved to be no need for a coalition as Labour won the election by a [[landslide victory|landslide]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Making Minority Government Work:Hung Parliaments and the Challenges for Westminster and Whitehall|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/pdfs/making-minority-gov-work.pdf|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]] (Britain's first for [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|36 years]]), and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], led by [[David Cameron]], which had won the largest number of seats, formed a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in order to gain a parliamentary majority, ending 13 years of Labour government. This was the first time that the Conservatives and Lib Dems had made a power-sharing deal at Westminster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2010/05/lib-dems-government-deal|title=Tories and Lib Dems enter full coalition government|publisher=The New Statesman}}</ref> It was also the first full coalition in Britain since 1945, having been formed 70 years virtually to the day after the establishment of [[Winston Churchill]]'s wartime coalition,<ref>Churchill became Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, [[David Cameron]] on 11 May 2010. Churchill formed his War Cabinet on 11 May: Winston S. Churchill (1949) ''Their Finest Hour''.</ref> although there had been a \"[[Lib-Lab pact]]\", an agreement stopping well short of a coalition, between the Labour and Liberal parties, from March 1977 until July 1978, after a series of by-election defeats had eroded Labour's majority of three seats which had been gained at the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 election]].\nLabour and The Liberal Democrats entered into Coalition three times in The Scottish Parliament and Twice in the Welsh Assembly. The 2016 Welsh Government is also a Coalition with The Liberal Democrats and Labour with Kirsty Williams AM taking the Education Portfolio.\n\nThe 2017 General Election resulted in a de facto Coalition between The Conservative Party and The Northern Ireland Democratic Unionist Party.\n\n====Germany====\nIn Germany, for instance, coalition government is the norm, as it is rare for either the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] together with their partners the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CDU/CSU), or the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), to win an unqualified majority in a national election. Thus, at the federal level, governments are formed with at least two parties. For example, [[Helmut Kohl]]'s CDU governed for years in coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP); from 1998 to 2005 [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]'s SPD was in power with the [[German Green Party|Greens]]; and from 2009 [[Angela Merkel]], CDU/CSU was in power with the FDP.\n\n\"Grand coalitions\" of the two large parties also occur, but these are relatively rare, as large parties usually prefer to associate with small ones. However, if none of the larger parties can receive enough votes to form their preferred coalition, a grand coalition might be their only choice for forming a government. This was the situation in Germany in 2005 when Angela Merkel became Chancellor: in early [[German federal election, 2005|elections]], the CDU/CSU did not garner enough votes to form a majority coalition with the FDP; similarly the SPD and Greens did not have enough votes to continue with their formerly ruling coalition. A grand coalition government was subsequently forged between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. Partnerships like these typically involve carefully structured cabinets. The CDU/CSU ended up holding the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellory]] while the SPD took the majority of cabinet posts. Parties frequently make statements ahead of elections which coalitions they categorically reject, similar to election promises or shadow cabinets in other countries.\n\nIn Germany, coalitions rarely consist of more than two parties (CDU and CSU, two allies which always form a single [[caucus]], are in this regard considered a single party). However, in the 2010s coalitions on the state level increasingly included three different parties, often [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], Greens and one of the major parties or \"red red green\" coalitions of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], [[Linkspartei]] and Greens.\n\n===Examples of coalitions===\n\n====Australia====\nIn federal [[Politics of Australia|Australian politics]], the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]], [[National Party of Australia|National]], [[Country Liberal Party|Country Liberal]] and [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National]] parties are united in a coalition, known simply as [[Coalition (Australia)|the Coalition]]. The Coalition has become so stable, at least at the federal level, that in practice the lower house of Parliament has become a [[two-party system|two-party]] house, with the Coalition and the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] being the major parties. This coalition is also found in the states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]] the Liberal and National parties compete separately, while in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]] the two parties have merged, forming the Country Liberal Party, in 1978, and the Liberal National Party, in 2008, respectively.\n\nThe other federal coalition has been:\n*[[United Australia Party|United Australia]]\u2013[[National Country Party|Country]]\u2013Independents coalition in [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940]]\n*In [[Tasmanian Government|Tasmania]]:\n**Liberal\u2013Greens coalition in [[Tasmanian state election, 1996|1996]].\n**Labor\u2013Greens coalitions formed in [[Tasmanian state election, 1989|1989]] and [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|2010]].\n*In the [[ACT Government|Australian Capital Territory]]:\n**Liberal\u2013[[Independent (politician)|Independent]] coalition in [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 1998|1998]].\n**Labor\u2013Greens coalitions in [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2001|2001]] and [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2008|2008]].\n\n====Belgium====\nIn [[Politics of Belgium|Belgium]], where there are separate [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking and [[French language|French]]-speaking parties for each political grouping, coalition cabinets of up to six parties are common.\n\n====Canada====\nIn [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], the [[Great Coalition]] was formed in 1864 by the [[Clear Grits]], [[Parti bleu]], and [[Liberal-Conservative Party]]. During the [[First World War]], Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] attempted to form a coalition with the opposition Liberals to broaden support for controversial conscription legislation. The Liberal Party refused the offer but some of their members did [[crossing the floor|cross the floor]] and join the government. Although sometimes referred to as a coalition government, according to the definition above, it was not. It was disbanded after the end of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/precedents-from-around-the-world-1.876563|title=Coalition Government: Precedents from around the world|publisher=CBC News|date=2010-05-13|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[Ontario general election, 1919|1919 Ontario election]], the [[United Farmers of Ontario]] and the [[Labour Party of Canada|Labour Party]], together with three independent MLAs, formed a coalition that governed [[Ontario]] until 1923.\n\nIn [[British Columbia]], the governing Liberals formed a coalition with the opposition Conservatives in order to prevent the surging, left-wing [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] from taking power in the [[British Columbia general election, 1941]]. Liberal premier [[Duff Pattullo]] refused to form a coalition with the third-place Conservatives, so his party removed him. The Liberal\u2013Conservative coalition introduced a winner-take-all preferential voting system (the \"[[Alternative Vote]]\") in the hopes that their supporters would rank the other party as their second preference; however, this strategy did not take CCF second preferences into account. In the [[British Columbia general election, 1952]], to the surprise of many, the right-wing populist [[BC Social Credit Party]] won a minority. They were able to win a majority in the subsequent election as Liberal and Conservative supporters shifted their anti-CCF vote to Social Credit.\n\nManitoba has had more formal coalition governments than any other province. Following gains by the United Farmer's/Progressive movement elsewhere in the country, the [[United Farmers of Manitoba]] unexpectedly won the 1921 election. Like their counterparts in Ontario, they had not expected to win and did not have a leader. They asked [[John Bracken]], a professor in animal husbandry, to become leader and premier. Bracken changed the party's name to the [[Progressive Party of Manitoba]]. During the Great Depression, Bracken survived at a time when other premiers were being defeated by forming a coalition government with the Manitoba Liberals (eventually, the two parties would merge into the [[Manitoba Liberal Party#Liberal-Progressive Party: Merger with the Progressives|Liberal-Progressive Party of Manitoba]], and decades later, the party would change its name to the [[Manitoba Liberal Party]]). In 1940, Bracken formed a wartime coalition government with almost every party in the Manitoba Legislature (the Conservatives, CCF, and Social Credit; however, the CCF broke with the coalition after a few years over policy differences). The only party not included was the small, communist [[Labor-Progressive Party]], which had a handful of seats.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, NDP premier [[Roy Romanow]] formed a formal coalition with the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party|Saskatchewan Liberals]] in 1999 after being reduced to a minority. After two years, the newly elected Liberal leader [[Jim Melanchuk]] chose to withdraw from the coalition; however, 2 out of 3 members of his caucus disagreed with him and left the Liberals to run as New Democrats in the upcoming election. The [[Saskatchewan NDP]] was re-elected with a majority under its new leader [[Lorne Calvert]], while the Saskatchewan Liberals lost their remaining seats and have not been competitive in the province since.\n\nAccording to historian [[Christopher Moore (Canadian historian)|Christopher Moore]], coalition governments in Canada became much less possible in 1919, when the leaders of parties were no longer chosen by elected MPs but instead began to be chosen by party members. That kind of leadership selection process had never been tried in any parliament system before and remains uncommon in the parliaments of the world today. According to Moore, as long as that kind of leadership selection process remains in place and concentrates power in the hands of the leader, as opposed to backbenchers, then coalition governments will be very difficult to form. Moore shows that the diffusion of power within a party tends to also lead to a diffusion of power in the parliament in which that party operates, thereby making coalitions more likely.<ref name=Moore-1>{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Christopher|year=2011|title=Come together|journal=[[Canada's History]]|issue=June\u2013July 2011|pages=53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2008 Canadian parliamentary dispute]], two of Canada's opposition parties signed an agreement to form what would become the country's second coalition government since [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]] if the minority Conservative government was defeated on a vote of non-confidence,<ref>{{cite web|title=Coalition Set To Topple Canada PM|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122818032317670973?mod=googlenews_wsj|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2008-12-02|author=Menon, Nirmala}}</ref> unseating [[Stephen Harper]] as Prime Minister. The agreement outlined a formal coalition consisting of two opposition parties, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]. The [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] agreed to support the proposed coalition on confidence matters for 18 months. In the end, parliament was [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogued]] by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], and the coalition dispersed following the election.\n\n====Denmark====\nIn Denmark, all governments from 1982 until the June 2015 elections have been coalitions. The first coalition in Danish political history was formed in 1929 by [[Thorvald Stauning]] and consisted of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (Staunings own party) and the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberals]]. Since then, a number of parties have participated in coalitions.\n\nExcluding the post-[[World War II|WW2]] [[Cabinet of Vilhelm Buhl II|Liberation Cabinet's]] member parties, the following parties have done so: The [[Centre Democrats (Denmark)|Centre Democrats]], the [[Christian Democrats (Denmark)|Christian People's Party]], the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]], the [[Justice Party of Denmark|Justice Party]], the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]], the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]], and [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]].\n\n====Finland====\nIn [[Politics of Finland|Finland]], no party has had an absolute majority in the parliament since independence, and multi-party coalitions have been the norm. Finland experienced its most stable government ([[Paavo Lipponen's first cabinet|Lipponen I]] and [[Paavo Lipponen's second cabinet|II]]) since [[Finland's declaration of independence|independence]] with a five-party governing coalition, a so-called \"rainbow government\". The Lipponen cabinets set the stability record and were unusual in the respect that both moderate (SDP) and radical left wing (Left Alliance) parties sat in the government with the major right-wing party (National Coalition). The [[Jyrki Katainen's cabinet|Katainen cabinet]] was also a rainbow coalition of a total of five parties.\n\n====India====\nSince India's Independence on 15 August 1947, [[Indian National Congress]], the major political party instrumental in [[Indian independence movement]], ruled the nation. The first Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], second PM [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] and the third PM [[Indira Gandhi]], all were from the Congress party. However, [[Raj Narain]], who had unsuccessfully contested election against Indira from the constituency of [[Rae Bareilly]] in 1971, lodged a case, alleging electoral malpractices. In June 1975, Indira was found guilty and barred by High Court from holding public office for six years. In response, an ungracious Emergency was declared under the pretext of national security. The [[Indian general election, 1977|next election's result]] was that [[Politics of India|India]]'s first-ever coalition government was formed at the national level under the Prime Ministership of [[Morarji Desai]], which was also the first non-Congress national government, which existed from 24 March 1977 to 15 July 1979, headed by the [[Janata Party]],<ref name=\"UK\">{{cite web|title=OBITUARY: Morarji Desai|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-morarji-desai-1615165.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|author=Kuldip Singh|date=1995-04-11|accessdate=2009-06-27}}</ref> an amalgam of political parties opposed to Emergency imposed between 1975 and 1977. As the popularity of Janata Party dwindled, Morarji Desai had to resign and [[Charan Singh]], a rival of Desai became the fifth PM. However, due to lack of support, this coalition government did not complete its five-year term.\n\nCongress returned to the                                                                                                                                                                                          power in 1980 under Indira Gandhi, and later under [[Rajiv Gandhi]] as the 6th PM. However, the next [[Indian general election, 1989|general election of 1989]] once again brought a coalition government under [[National Front (India)|National Front]], which lasted until 1991, with two Prime Ministers, the second one being supported by Congress. The 1991 election resulted in a Congress led stable [[minority government]] for five years. The next 11th [[Lok Sabha|parliament]] produced three Prime Ministers in two years and forced the country back to the polls in 1998. The first successful coalition government in India which completed the whole 5-year term was the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] with [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] as PM from 1999 to 2004. Then another coalition, Congress led [[United Progressive Alliance]], consisting of 13 separate parties ruled India for two terms from 2004 to 2014 with [[Manmohan Singh]] as PM. However, in the [[Indian general election, 2014|16th general election]] in May 2014, BJP secured majority on its own (first party to do so since 1984 election) and National Democratic Alliance again came into power, with [[Narendra Modi]] as Prime Minister and more.\n\n====Indonesia====\nAs a result of the [[Fall of Suharto|toppling of Suharto]], political freedom is significantly increased. Compared to only three parties allowed to exist in the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era, a total of 48 political parties participated in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 1999|1999 election]], a total of 24 parties in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2004|2004 election]], 38 parties in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2009|2009 election]], and 15 parties in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2014|2014 election]]. There are no majority winner of those elections and coalition governments are inevitable. The current government is a coalition of seven parties led by the [[Indonesian Democratic Party \u2013 Struggle|PDIP]] and [[Party of the Functional Groups|Golkar]].\n\n====Ireland====\nIn [[Republic of Ireland]], coalition governments are quite common; not since 1977 has a single party been able to form a majority government. Coalitions are the typically formed of two or more parties always consisting of one of the two biggest parties, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]], and one or more smaller parties or independent members of parliament. The current government consists of a minority Fine Gael government, supported by a [[confidence and supply]] arrangement with Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\nIreland's first coalition government was formed in [[Irish general election, 1948|1948]]. Ireland has had consecutive coalition governments since the [[Irish general election, 1989|1989 general election]], excluding two brief Fianna F\u00e1il minority administrations in 1994 and 2011 that followed the withdrawal of their coalition partners from government. Before 1989, Fianna F\u00e1il had opposed participation in coalition governments, preferring single-party minority government instead.\n\nIrish coalition governments have traditionally been based on one of two large blocs in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]: either Fianna F\u00e1il in coalition with smaller parties or independents, or Fine Gael and the Labour Party in coalition, sometimes with smaller parties. The only exception to these traditional alliances was the [[23rd Government of Ireland]], comprising Fianna F\u00e1il and the Labour Party, which ruled between 1993 and 1994. The [[Government of the 31st D\u00e1il]], though a traditional Fine Gael\u2013Labour coalition, resembles a [[grand coalition]], due to the collapse of the Fianna F\u00e1il to third place among parties in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n\n====Israel====\nA similar situation exists in [[Politics of Israel|Israel]], which typically has at least 10 parties holding representation in the [[Knesset]]. The only faction to ever gain the majority of Knesset seats was [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]], an alliance of the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] and [[Mapam]] that held an absolute majority for a brief period from 1968 to 1969. Historically, control of the Israeli government has alternated between periods of rule by the right-wing [[Likud]] in coalition with several right-wing and religious parties and periods of rule by the center-left Labor in coalition with several left-wing parties. [[Ariel Sharon]]'s formation of the centrist [[Kadima]] party in 2006 drew support from former Labor and Likud members, and Kadima ruled in coalition with several other parties.\n\nIsrael also formed a [[national unity government]] from [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984\u20131988]]. The premiership and foreign ministry portfolio were held by the head of each party for two years, and they switched roles in 1986.\n\n====Japan====\nPost-World War II [[Politics of Japan|Japan]] has historically been dominated by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], but there was a brief coalition government formed after the [[Japanese general election, 1993|1993 election]] following LDP's first loss of its overall [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] majority since 1955, winning only 223 out of 511 seats. The LDP government was replaced by an eight-party coalition government, which consisted of all of the previous opposition parties excluding the [[Japanese Communist Party]], who together controlled 243 seats. Every Japanese government since then has been a coalition government in one way or another.\n\n==== New Zealand ====\n{{Main|Electoral system of New Zealand#MMP in New Zealand}}\n[[MMP representation|MMP]] was introduced in [[New Zealand]] in [[New Zealand general election, 1996|the 1996 election]]. \nIn order to get into parliament, parties need to get a total of 50% of the 121 seats in parliament \u2013 61. Since no parties have ever gotten a full majority, they must form coalitions with other parties. For example, in 2017, [[Labour Party (New Zealand)|Labour]] got 46 seats, [[New Zealand First]] got nine, and the [[Green Party (New Zealand)|Green Party]] got eight, which adds up to a total of 63 seats.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}\nAdvocates of proportional representation suggest that a coalition government leads to more consensus-based politics, as a government comprising differing parties (often based on different ideologies) need to compromise about governmental policy. Another stated advantage is that a coalition government better reflects the popular opinion of the [[Constituency|electorate]] within a country.<ref name=\"Moore-1\"/>\n\nThose who disapprove of coalition governments believe that such governments have a tendency to be fractious and prone to disharmony, as their component parties hold differing beliefs and thus may not always agree on policy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moury |first1=Catherine |last2=Timmermans |first2=Arco |title=Inter-party conflict management in coalition governments: Analyzing the role of coalition agreements in Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands |journal=Politics and Governance |date=25 July 2013 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=117\u2013131 |doi=10.17645/pag.v1i2.94 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/94 |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Sometimes the results of an election mean that the coalitions which are mathematically most probable are ideologically infeasible, for example in [[Flanders]] or [[Northern Ireland]]. A second difficulty might be the ability of minor parties to play \"[[kingmaker]]\" and, particularly in close elections, gain far more power in exchange for their support than the size of their vote would otherwise justify.\n\nCoalition governments have also been criticized{{By whom|date=May 2014}} for sustaining a [[consensus]] on issues when disagreement and the consequent discussion would be more fruitful. To forge a consensus, the leaders of ruling coalition parties can agree to silence their disagreements on an issue to unify the coalition against the opposition. The coalition partners, if they control the parliamentary majority, can collude to make the parliamentary discussion on the issue irrelevant by consistently disregarding the arguments of the opposition and voting against the opposition's proposals \u2014 even if there is disagreement within the ruling parties about the issue.\n\nPowerful parties can also act in an [[Oligocracy|oligocratic]] way to form an alliance to stifle the growth of emerging parties. Of course, such an event is rare in coalition governments when compared to [[two-party system]]s, which typically exist because of stifling of the growth of emerging parties, often through discriminatory [[nomination rules]] regulations and [[plurality voting system]]s, and so on.\n\nA single, more powerful party can shape the policies of the coalition disproportionately. Smaller or less powerful parties can be intimidated to not openly disagree. In order to maintain the coalition, they would have to vote against their own party's platform in the parliament. If they do not, the party has to leave the government and loses executive power.

A chemical engineer designs large-scale processes that convert chemicals, raw materials, living cells, microorganisms, and energy into useful forms and products.\n\nChemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation, including safety and hazard assessments, process design and analysis, [[control engineering]], [[chemical reaction engineering]], construction specification, and operating instructions.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Davis GE.jpg|thumb|150px|[[George E. Davis]]]]\n\nA 1996 ''[[British Journal for the History of Science]]'' article cites James F. Donnelly for mentioning an 1839 reference to chemical engineering in relation to the production of [[sulfuric acid]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=172}} In the same paper however, [[George E. Davis]], an English consultant, was credited for having coined the term.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=174}} Davis also tried to found a ''Society of Chemical Engineering'', but instead it was named the [[Society of Chemical Industry]] (1881), with Davis as its first Secretary.<ref name=\"Swindin\">{{cite journal|last1=Swindin|first1=N.|title=George E.

Most authors agree that Davis invented the concept of unit operations if not substantially developed it.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|pp=172\u2013173}} He gave a series of lectures on unit operations at the [[Manchester Technical School]] (later part of the [[University of Manchester]]) in 1887, considered to be one of the earliest such about chemical engineering.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=175}} Three years before Davis' lectures, [[Henry Edward Armstrong]] taught a degree course in chemical engineering at the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]]. Armstrong's course failed simply because its graduates ... were not especially attractive to employers. Employers of the time would have rather hired chemists and [[mechanical engineers]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=176}} Courses in chemical engineering offered by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the United States, [[Owens College, Manchester|Owens College]] in [[Manchester]], England, and [[University College London]] suffered under similar circumstances.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=178}}\n\n[[File:MIT Industrial Chemistry Lab.gif|thumb|Students inside an industrial chemistry laboratory at MIT|250px]]\n\nStarting from 1888,{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=180}} [[Lewis M. Norton]] taught at MIT the first chemical engineering course in the United States. Norton's course was contemporaneous and essentially similar to Armstrong's course. Both courses, however, simply merged chemistry and engineering subjects along with product design. \"Its practitioners had difficulty convincing engineers that they were engineers and chemists that they were not simply chemists.\"{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=176}} Unit operations was introduced into the course by [[William Hultz Walker]] in 1905.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=183}} By the early 1920s, unit operations became an important aspect of chemical engineering at MIT and other US universities, as well as at [[Imperial College London]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=184}} The [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE), established in 1908, played a key role in making chemical engineering considered an independent science, and unit operations central to chemical engineering. For instance, it defined chemical engineering to be a \"science of itself, the basis of which is ... unit operations\" in a 1922 report; and with which principle, it had published a list of academic institutions which offered \"satisfactory\" chemical engineering courses.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=187}} Meanwhile, promoting chemical engineering as a distinct science in Britain lead to the establishment of the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] (IChemE) in 1922.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=189}} IChemE likewise helped make unit operations considered essential to the discipline.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=190}}\n\n===New concepts and innovations===\nBy the 1940s, it became clear that unit operations alone were insufficient in developing [[chemical reactor]]s. While the predominance of unit operations in chemical engineering courses in Britain and the United States continued until the 1960s, [[Transport phenomena (engineering & physics)|transport phenomena]] started to experience greater focus.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=185}} Along with other novel concepts, such as [[process systems engineering]] (PSE), a \"second paradigm\" was defined.{{sfn|Ogawa|2007|p=2}}{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=29}} Transport phenomena gave an [[systems analysis|analytical]] approach to chemical engineering{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=30}} while PSE focused on its synthetic elements, such as [[control system]] and [[Process design (chemical engineering)|process design]].{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=31}} Developments in chemical engineering before and after [[World War II]] were mainly incited by the [[petrochemical industry]],{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=177}} however, advances in other fields were made as well. Advancements in [[biochemical engineering]] in the 1940s, for example, found application in the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and allowed for the [[mass production]] of various [[antibiotic]]s, including [[penicillin]] and [[streptomycin]].{{sfn|Perkins|2003|pp=32\u201333}} Meanwhile, progress in [[polymer science]] in the 1950s paved way for the \"age of plastics\".{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=7S}}\n\n===Safety and hazard developments===\nConcerns regarding the safety and environmental impact of large-scale chemical manufacturing facilities were also raised during this period. ''[[Silent Spring]]'', published in 1962, alerted its readers to the harmful effects of [[DDT]], a potent [[insecticide]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The 1974 [[Flixborough disaster]] in the United Kingdom resulted in 28 deaths, as well as damage to a [[chemical plant]] and three nearby villages.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]] in India resulted in almost 4,000 deaths.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} These incidents, along with [[List of industrial disasters|other incidents]], affected the reputation of the trade as [[industrial safety]] and [[environmental protection]] were given more focus.{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=8S}} In response, the IChemE required safety to be part of every degree course that it accredited after 1982. By the 1970s, legislation and monitoring agencies were instituted in various countries, such as France, Germany, and the United States.{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=35}}\n\n===Recent progress===\nAdvancements in [[computer science]] found applications designing and managing plants, simplifying calculations and drawings that previously had to be done manually. The completion of the [[Human Genome Project]] is also seen as a major development, not only advancing chemical engineering but [[genetic engineering]] and [[genomics]] as well.{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=9S}} Chemical engineering principles were used to produce [[DNA sequences]] in large quantities.{{sfn|American Institute of Chemical Engineers|2003a}}\n\n==Concepts==\n{{chemical engineering}}\n\nChemical engineering involves the application of several principles. Key concepts are presented below.\n\n===Plant design and construction===\nChemical engineering design concerns the creation of plans, specification, and economic analyses for [[pilot plant]]s, new plants or plant modifications. Design engineers often work in a consulting role, designing plants to meet clients' needs. Design is limited by a number of factors, including funding, government regulations and safety standards. These constraints dictate a plant's choice of process, materials and equipment.{{sfn|Towler|Sinnott|2008|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nPlant construction is coordinated by [[project engineering|project engineers]] and project managers <ref>Herbst, Andrew; Hans Verwijs (Oct. 19-22). \"Project Engineering: Interdisciplinary Coordination and Overall Engineering Quality Control\". Proc. of the Annual IAC conference of the American Society for Engineering Management 1 ({{ISBN|9781618393616}}): 15\u201321</ref> depending on the size of the investment. A chemical engineer may do the job of project engineer full-time or part of the time, which requires additional training and job skills or act as a consultant to the project group. In the USA the education of chemical engineering graduates from the Baccalaureate programs accredited by [[ABET]] do not usually stress project engineering education, which can be obtained by specialized training, as electives, or from [[graduate programs]].  Project engineering jobs are some of the largest employers for chemical engineers.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Do Chemical Engineers Do?|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistrystudentfaqs/f/chemeng.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Process design and analysis===\n{{main|Process design}}\n\nA unit operation is a physical step in an individual chemical engineering process. Unit operations (such as [[crystallization]], [[filtration]], [[drying]] and [[evaporation]]) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors.{{sfn|McCabe|Smith|Hariott|1993|p=4}} On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a unit operation. Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process operation. Unit processes (such as [[nitration]] and [[oxidation]]) involve the conversion of material by [[biochemical]], [[thermochemical]] and other means. Chemical engineers responsible for these are called process engineers.{{sfn|Silla|2003|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nProcess design requires the definition of equipment types and sizes as well as how they are connected together and the materials of construction. Details are often printed on a [[Process Flow Diagram]] which is used to control the capacity and reliability of a new or modified chemical factory.\n\n[[Education for Chemical Engineers|Education for chemical engineers]] in the first college degree 3 or 4 years of study stresses the principles and practices of process design. The same skills are used in existing chemical plants to evaluate the [[Economics#Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and make recommendations for improvements.\n\n===Transport phenomena===\n{{main|Transport phenomena}}\n\nModeling and analysis of transport phenomena is essential for many industrial applications. Transport phenomena involve [[fluid dynamics]], [[heat transfer]] and [[mass transfer]], which are governed mainly by [[momentum transfer]], [[energy transfer]] and transport of [[chemical species]] respectively. Models often involve separate considerations for  [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]], [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] and [[molecular]] level phenomena. Modeling of transport phenomena therefore requires an understanding of applied mathematics.{{sfn|Bird|Stewart|Lightfoot|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n==Applications and practice==\n[[File:Chemengg.jpg|thumb|left|Chemical engineers use computers to control automated systems in plants.{{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=47\u201348}}|alt=Two computer flat screens showing a plant process management application]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0205-015, Chemiekombinat Bitterfeld, Produktion von Wei\u00dft\u00f6nern.jpg|right|thumb|Operators in a chemical plant using an older analog control board, seen in East-Germany, 1986.]]\n\n[[Chemical engineer]]s \"develop economic ways of using materials and energy\".{{sfn|American Institute of Chemical Engineers|2003|loc=Article III}} Chemical engineers use [[chemistry]] and engineering to turn raw materials into usable products, such as medicine, petrochemicals and plastics on a large-scale, industrial setting. They are also involved in [[waste management]] and research. Both applied and research facets could make extensive use of computers.{{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=47\u201348}}\n\nChemical engineers may be involved in industry or university research where they are tasked with designing and performing experiments to create better and safer methods for production, pollution control, and resource conservation. They may be involved in designing and constructing plants as a [[project engineer]]. Chemical engineers serving as project engineers use their knowledge in selecting optimal production methods and plant equipment to minimize costs and maximize safety and profitability. After plant construction, chemical engineering project managers may be involved in equipment upgrades, process changes, troubleshooting, and daily operations in either full-time or consulting roles. {{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=49\u201350}}\n\n==Related fields and topics==\nToday, the field of chemical engineering is a diverse one, covering areas from [[biotechnology]] and [[nanotechnology]]  to [[mineral processing]].\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Biochemical engineering]]\n*[[Biological engineering]]\n*[[Bioprocess engineering]]\n*[[Bioinformatics]]\n*[[Biomedical engineering]]\n*[[Biomolecular engineering]]\n*[[Biotechnology]]\n*[[Biotechnology engineering]]\n*[[Catalysts]]\n*[[Ceramic]]s\n*[[Chemical process modeling]]\n*[[Chemical Technologist]]\n*[[Chemical reactor]]\n*[[Chemical weapons]]\n*[[Cheminformatics]]\n*[[Computational fluid dynamics]]\n*[[Corrosion engineering]]\n*[[Cost estimation]]\n*[[Electrochemistry]]\n* [[Electrochemical engineering]]\n*[[Environmental engineering]]\n*[[Earthquake engineering]]\n*[[Fischer Tropsch synthesis]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Fluid dynamics]]\n*[[Food engineering]]\n*[[Fuel cell]]\n*[[Gasification]]\n*[[Heat transfer]]\n*[[Industrial chemistry]]\n*[[Industrial gas]]\n*[[Industrial catalysts]]\n*[[Mass transfer]]\n*[[Materials science]]\n*[[Metallurgy]]\n*[[Microfluidics]]\n*[[Mineral processing]]\n*[[Molecular engineering]]\n*[[Nanotechnology]]\n*[[Natural environment]]\n*[[Natural gas processing]]\n*[[Nuclear reprocessing]]\n*[[Oil exploration]]\n*[[Oil refinery]]\n*[[Petroleum engineering]]\n*[[Pharmaceutical engineering]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Plastics engineering]]\n*[[Polymer]]s\n*[[Process control]]\n*[[Process design (chemical engineering)|Process design]]\n*[[Process development]]\n*[[Process engineering]]\n*[[Process miniaturization]]\n*[[Paper engineering]]\n*[[Safety engineering]]\n*[[Semiconductor device fabrication]]\n*[[Separation process]]es (see also: [[separation of mixture]])\n**[[Crystallization processes]]\n**[[Distillation|Distillation processes]]\n**[[Membrane technology|Membrane processes]]\n*[[Syngas production]]\n*[[Textile engineering]]\n*[[Thermodynamics]]\n*[[Transport phenomena]]\n*[[Unit operations]]\n*[[Water technology]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Chemistry|Engineering}}\n* [[Food engineering|Contemporary food engineering]]\n* ''[[Education for Chemical Engineers]]''\n* [[English Engineering units]]\n* [[List of chemical engineering societies]]\n* [[List of chemical engineers]]\n* [[List of chemical process simulators]]\n* [[Outline of chemical engineering]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{citation | url = http://www.aiche.org/About/WhoWeAre/Governance/Constitution.aspx | title = AIChE Constitution | author = American Institute of Chemical Engineers | date = 2003-01-17 | accessdate = 2011-08-13}}.\n*{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=L5FnNlIaGfcC | title = Transport Phenomena | edition = 2nd | last = Bird | first = R.

The interval {{math|''C'' {{=}} (2, 4)}} is not compact because it is not closed. The interval {{math|''B'' {{=}} [0, 1]}} is compact because it is both closed and bounded.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[general topology]], '''compactness''' is a property that generalizes the notion of a subset of [[Euclidean space]] being [[closed set|closed]] (that is, containing all its [[limit point]]s) and [[bounded set|bounded]] (that is, having all its points lie within some fixed distance of each other). Examples include a [[closed interval]], a [[rectangle]], or a finite set of points. This notion is defined for more general [[topological space]]s than Euclidean space in various ways.\n\nOne such generalization is that a topological space is [[sequentially compact|''sequentially'' compact]] if every [[infinite sequence]] of points sampled from the space has an infinite [[subsequence]] that converges to some point of the space. The [[Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem]] states that a subset of Euclidean space is compact in this sequential sense if and only if it is closed and bounded. Thus, if one chooses an infinite number of points in the ''closed'' [[unit interval]] {{math|[0, 1]}} some of those points will get arbitrarily close to some real number in that space. For instance, some of the numbers {{nowrap|1/2, 4/5, 1/3, 5/6, 1/4, 6/7, &hellip;}} accumulate to 0 (others accumulate to 1). The same set of points would not accumulate to any point of the ''open'' unit interval {{math|(0, 1)}}; so the open unit interval is not compact. Euclidean space itself is not compact since it is not bounded. In particular, the sequence of points {{nowrap|0,\u20091,\u20092,\u20093,\u2009\u2026}} has no subsequence that converges to any real number.\n\nApart from closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space, typical examples of compact spaces include spaces consisting not of geometrical points but of [[function space|functions]]. The term ''compact'' was introduced into mathematics by [[Maurice Fr\u00e9chet]] in 1904 as a distillation of this concept.  Compactness in this more general situation plays an extremely important role in [[mathematical analysis]], because many classical and important theorems of 19th-century analysis, such as the [[extreme value theorem]], are easily generalized to this situation.  A typical application is furnished by the [[Arzel\u00e0\u2013Ascoli theorem]] or the [[Peano existence theorem]], in which one is able to conclude the existence of a function with some required properties as a limiting case of some more elementary construction.\n\nVarious equivalent notions of compactness, including [[Sequentially compact space|sequential compactness]] and [[limit point compact]]ness, can be developed in general [[metric space]]s. In general topological spaces, however, different notions of compactness are not necessarily equivalent. The most useful notion, which is the standard definition of the unqualified term ''compactness'', is phrased in terms of the existence of finite families of [[open set]]s that \"[[Cover (topology)|cover]]\" the space in the sense that each point of the space lies in some set contained in the family. This more subtle notion, introduced by [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Urysohn]] in 1929, exhibits compact spaces as generalizations of [[finite set]]s.  In spaces that are compact in this sense, it is often possible to patch together information that holds [[local property|locally]]&mdash;that is, in a neighborhood of each point&mdash;into corresponding statements that hold throughout the space, and many [[#Theorems|theorems]] are of this character.\n\nThe term '''compact set''' is sometimes a synonym for compact space, but usually refers to a [[#Compactness of subsets|compact subspace]] of a topological space.\n\n== Historical development ==\nIn the 19th century, several disparate mathematical properties were understood that would later be seen as consequences of compactness.  On the one hand, [[Bernard Bolzano]] ([[#CITEREFBolzano1817|1817]]) had been aware that any bounded sequence of points (in the line or plane, for instance) has a subsequence that must eventually get arbitrarily close to some other point, called a [[limit point]].  Bolzano's proof relied on the [[method of bisection]]: the sequence was placed into an interval that was then divided into two equal parts, and a part containing infinitely many terms of the sequence was selected.  The process could then be repeated by dividing the resulting smaller interval into smaller and smaller parts until it closes down on the desired limit point.  The full significance of [[Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem|Bolzano's theorem]], and its method of proof, would not emerge until almost 50 years later when it was rediscovered by [[Karl Weierstrass]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kline|1972|pp=952\u2013953}}; {{harvnb|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|p=561}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1880s, it became clear that results similar to the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem could be formulated for [[function spaces|spaces of functions]] rather than just numbers or geometrical points. The idea of regarding functions as themselves points of a generalized space dates back to the investigations of [[Giulio Ascoli]] and [[Cesare Arzel\u00e0]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kline|1972|loc=Chapter 46, \u00a72}}</ref>  The culmination of their investigations, the [[Arzel\u00e0\u2013Ascoli theorem]], was a generalization of the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem to families of [[continuous function]]s, the precise conclusion of which was that it was possible to extract a [[uniform convergence|uniformly convergent]] sequence of functions from a suitable family of functions.  The uniform limit of this sequence then played precisely the same role as Bolzano's \"limit point\".  Towards the beginning of the twentieth century, results similar to that of Arzel\u00e0 and Ascoli began to accumulate in the area of [[integral equation]]s, as investigated by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Erhard Schmidt]].  For a certain class of [[Green's function|Green functions]] coming from solutions of integral equations, Schmidt had shown that a property analogous to the Arzel\u00e0\u2013Ascoli theorem held in the sense of [[mean convergence]]&mdash;or convergence in what would later be dubbed a [[Hilbert space]].  This ultimately led to the notion of a [[compact operator]] as an offshoot of the general notion of a compact space. It was [[Maurice Ren\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chet|Maurice Fr\u00e9chet]] who, in [[#CITEREFFr\u00e9chet1906|1906]], had distilled the essence of the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass property and coined the term ''compactness'' to refer to this general phenomenon (he used the term already in his 1904 paper<ref>Frechet, M. 1904. Generalisation d'un theorem de Weierstrass. Analyse Mathematique.</ref> which led to the famous 1906 thesis).\n\nHowever, a different notion of compactness altogether had also slowly emerged at the end of the 19th century from the study of the [[linear continuum|continuum]], which was seen as fundamental for the rigorous formulation of analysis.  In 1870, [[Eduard Heine]] showed that a [[continuous function]] defined on a closed and bounded interval was in fact [[uniformly continuous]].  In the course of the proof, he made use of a lemma that from any countable cover of the interval by smaller open intervals, it was possible to select a finite number of these that also covered it. The significance of this lemma was recognized by [[\u00c9mile Borel]] ([[#CITEREFBorel1895|1895]]), and it was generalized to arbitrary collections of intervals by [[Pierre Cousin]] (1895) and [[Henri Lebesgue]] ([[#CITEREFLebesgue1904|1904]]).  The [[Heine\u2013Borel theorem]], as the result is now known, is another special property possessed by closed and bounded sets of real numbers.\n\nThis property was significant because it allowed for the passage from [[local property|local information]] about a set (such as the continuity of a function) to global information about the set (such as the uniform continuity of a function).  This sentiment was expressed by {{harvtxt|Lebesgue|1904}}, who also exploited it in the development of the [[Lebesgue integral|integral now bearing his name]].  Ultimately the Russian school of [[point-set topology]], under the direction of [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Urysohn]], formulated Heine\u2013Borel compactness in a way that could be applied to the modern notion of a [[topological space]].  {{harvtxt|Alexandrov|Urysohn|1929}} showed that the earlier version of compactness due to Fr\u00e9chet, now called (relative) [[sequential compactness]], under appropriate conditions followed from the version of compactness that was formulated in terms of the existence of finite subcovers.  It was this notion of compactness that became the dominant one, because it was not only a stronger property, but it could be formulated in a more general setting with a minimum of additional technical machinery, as it relied only on the structure of the open sets in a space.\n<!--\nOne of the main reasons for studying compact spaces is because they are in some ways very similar to [[finite set]]s: there are many results which are easy to show for finite sets, whose proofs carry over with minimal change to compact spaces. Here is an example:\n\n* Suppose ''X'' is a [[Hausdorff space]], and we have a point ''x'' in ''X'' and a finite subset ''A'' of ''X'' not containing ''x''. Then we can [[separated sets|separate]] ''x'' and ''A'' by [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhoods]]: for each ''a'' in ''A'', let ''U''(''x'') and ''V''(''a'') be disjoint neighborhoods containing ''x'' and ''a'', respectively. Then the intersection of all the ''U''(''x'') and the union of all the ''V''(''a'') are the required neighborhoods of ''x'' and ''A''.\n\nNote that if ''A'' is [[Infinity|infinite]], the proof fails, because the intersection of arbitrarily many neighborhoods of ''x'' might not be a neighborhood of ''x''. The proof can be \"rescued\", however, if ''A'' is compact: we simply take a finite subcover of the cover {{math|{''V''(''a'') : ''a'' \u2208 A}}} of ''A'', then intersect the corresponding finitely many ''U''(''x''). In this way, we see that in a Hausdorff space, any point can be separated by neighborhoods from any compact set not containing it. In fact, repeating the argument shows that any two disjoint compact sets in a Hausdorff space can be separated by neighborhoods&nbsp;\u2013 note that this is precisely what we get if we replace \"point\" (i.e. [[singleton set]]) with \"compact set\" in the Hausdorff [[separation axiom]]. Many of the arguments and results involving compact spaces follow such a pattern.\n-->\n\n==Basic examples==\nAny [[finite topological space|finite space]] is trivially compact. A non-trivial example of a compact space is the (closed) [[unit interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}} of [[real number]]s.  If one chooses an infinite number of distinct points in the unit interval, then there must be some [[accumulation point]] in that interval. For instance, the odd-numbered terms of the sequence {{nowrap|1,\u20091/2,\u20091/3,\u20093/4,\u20091/5,\u20095/6,\u20091/7,\u20097/8,\u2009...}} get arbitrarily close to&nbsp;0, while the even-numbered ones get arbitrarily close to&nbsp;1.  The given example sequence shows the importance of including the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] points of the interval, since the [[limit point]]s must be in the space itself \u2014 an open (or half-open) interval of the real numbers is not compact. It is also crucial that the interval be [[bounded set|bounded]], since in the interval {{closed-open|0,\u221e}} one could choose the sequence of points {{nowrap|0,\u20091,\u20092,\u20093,\u2009...}}, of which no sub-sequence ultimately gets arbitrarily close to any given real number.\n\nIn two dimensions, closed [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] are compact since for any infinite number of points sampled from a disk, some subset of those points must get arbitrarily close either to a point within the disc, or to a point on the boundary.  However, an open disk is not compact, because a sequence of points can tend to the boundary without getting arbitrarily close to any point in the interior.  Likewise, spheres are compact, but a sphere missing a point is not since a sequence of points can tend to the missing point, thereby not getting arbitrarily close to any point ''within'' the space.  Lines and planes are not compact, since one can take a set of equally-spaced points in any given direction without approaching any point.\n\n==Definitions==\nVarious definitions of compactness may apply, depending on the level of generality.  A subset of [[Euclidean space]] in particular is called compact if it is [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]].  This implies, by the [[Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem]], that any infinite [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] from the set has a [[subsequence]] that converges to a point in the set.  Various equivalent notions of compactness, such as [[sequential compactness]] and [[limit point compact]]ness, can be developed in general [[metric space]]s.\n\nIn general [[topological space]]s, however, the different notions of compactness are not equivalent, and the most useful notion of compactness&mdash;originally called ''bicompactness''&mdash;is defined using [[cover (topology)|cover]]s consisting of [[open set]]s (see ''Open cover definition'' below). That this form of compactness holds for closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space is known as the [[Heine\u2013Borel theorem]]. Compactness, when defined in this manner, often allows one to take information that is known [[local property|locally]]&mdash;in a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of each point of the space&mdash;and to extend it to information that holds globally throughout the space.  An example of this phenomenon is Dirichlet's theorem, to which it was originally applied by Heine, that a continuous function on a compact interval is [[uniformly continuous]]; here, continuity is a local property of the function, and uniform continuity the corresponding global property.\n\n===Open cover definition===\n\nFormally, a [[topological space]] {{mvar|X}} is called ''compact'' if each of its [[open cover]]s has a [[finite set|finite]] [[subcover]]. That is, {{mvar|X}} is compact if for every collection {{mvar|C}} of open subsets of {{mvar|X}} such that\n\n:<math>X = \\bigcup_{x \\in C}x</math>,\n\nthere is a '''finite''' subset {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|C}} such that\n\n:<math>X = \\bigcup_{x \\in F}x.</math>\n\nSome branches of mathematics such as [[algebraic geometry]], typically influenced by the French school of [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], use the term ''quasi-compact'' for the general notion, and reserve the term ''compact'' for topological spaces that are both [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and ''quasi-compact''.  A compact set is sometimes referred to as a ''compactum'', plural ''compacta''.\n\n===Compactness of subsets===\nA subset {{mvar|K}} of a topological space {{mvar|X}} is said to be compact if it is compact as a subspace (in the [[subspace topology]]).  That is, {{mvar|K}} is compact if for every arbitrary collection {{mvar|C}} of open subsets of {{mvar|X}} such that\n\n:<math>K \\subseteq \\bigcup_{c \\in C} c</math>,\n\nthere is a '''finite''' subset {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|C}} such that\n\n:<math>K \\subseteq \\bigcup_{c \\in F} c</math>.\n\nCompactness is a \"topological\" property. That is, if <math>K \\subset Z \\subset Y</math>, with subset {{mvar|Z}} equipped with the subspace topology, then {{mvar|K}} is compact in {{mvar|Z}} if and only if {{mvar|K}} is compact in {{mvar|Y}}.\n\n===Equivalent definitions===\nAssuming the [[axiom of choice]], the following are equivalent:\n# A topological space ''X''  is compact.\n# Every [[open cover]] of ''X'' has a finite [[subcover]].\n# ''X'' has a sub-base such that every cover of the space by members of the sub-base has a finite subcover ([[Alexander's sub-base theorem]])\n# Any collection of closed subsets of ''X'' with the [[finite intersection property]] has nonempty intersection.\n# Every [[Net (mathematics)|net]] on ''X'' has a convergent subnet (see the article on [[Net (mathematics)|nets]] for a proof).\n# Every [[mathematical filter|filter]] on ''X'' has a convergent refinement.\n# Every net on ''X'' has a cluster point.\n# Every filter on ''X'' has a cluster point.\n# Every [[ultrafilter]] on ''X'' converges to at least one point.\n# Every infinite subset of ''X'' has a [[complete accumulation point]].<ref>{{harv|Kelley|1955|p=163}}</ref>\n\n====Euclidean space====\nFor any [[subset]] ''A'' of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, ''A'' is compact if and only if it is [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]]; this is the [[Heine\u2013Borel theorem]].\n\nAs a [[Euclidean space]] is a metric space, the conditions in the next subsection also apply to all of its subsets. Of all of the equivalent conditions, it is in practice easiest to verify that a subset is closed and bounded, for example, for a closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] or closed ''n''-ball.\n\n====Metric spaces====\nFor any metric space (''X'', ''d''), the following are equivalent:\n# (''X'', ''d'') is compact.\n# (''X'', ''d'') is [[completeness (topology)|complete]] and [[totally bounded]] (this is also equivalent to compactness for [[uniform space]]s).<ref>{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.3.7}}</ref>\n# (''X'', ''d'') is sequentially compact; that is, every [[sequence]] in ''X'' has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in ''X'' (this is also equivalent to compactness for [[first-countable]] [[uniform space]]s).\n# (''X'', ''d'') is limit point compact; that is, every infinite subset of ''X'' has at least one [[limit point]] in ''X''.\n# (''X'', ''d'') is an image of a continuous function from the [[Cantor set]].<ref>{{harvnb|Willard|1970}} Theorem 30.7.</ref>\n\nA compact metric space (''X'', ''d'') also satisfies the following properties:\n# [[Lebesgue's number lemma]]: For every open cover of ''X'', there exists a number {{nowrap|''\u03b4'' > 0}} such that every subset of ''X'' of diameter < ''\u03b4'' is contained in some member of the cover.\n# (''X'', ''d'') is [[second-countable space|second-countable]], [[Separable space|separable]] and [[Lindel\u00f6f space|Lindel\u00f6f]] \u2013 these three conditions are equivalent for metric spaces. The converse is not true; e.g., a countable discrete space satisfies these three conditions, but is not compact.\n# ''X'' is closed and bounded (as a subset of any metric space whose restricted metric is ''d''). The converse may fail for a non-Euclidean space; e.g. the [[real line]] equipped with the [[discrete metric]] is closed and bounded but not compact, as the collection of all [[Singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. It is complete but not totally bounded.\n\n====Characterization by continuous functions====\nLet ''X'' be a topological space and C(''X'') the ring of real continuous functions on ''X''.  For each ''p''&isin;''X'', the evaluation map <math>\\operatorname{ev}_p\\colon C(X)\\to \\mathbf{R}</math>\ngiven by ev<sub>''p''</sub>(''f'')=''f''(''p'') is a ring homomorphism.  The [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ev<sub>''p''</sub> is a [[maximal ideal]], since the [[residue field]] {{nowrap|C(''X'')/ker ev<sub>''p''</sub>}} is the field of real numbers, by the [[first isomorphism theorem]].  A topological space ''X'' is [[pseudocompact space|pseudocompact]] if and only if every maximal ideal in C(''X'') has residue field the real numbers.  For [[completely regular space]]s, this is equivalent to every maximal ideal being the kernel of an evaluation homomorphism.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillman|Jerison|1976|loc=\u00a75.6}}</ref>  There are pseudocompact spaces that are not compact, though.\n\nIn general, for non-pseudocompact spaces there are always maximal ideals ''m'' in C(''X'') such that the residue field C(''X'')/''m'' is a ([[non-archimedean field|non-archimedean]]) [[hyperreal field]].  The framework of [[non-standard analysis]] allows for the following alternative characterization of compactness:<ref>{{harvnb|Robinson||loc=Theorem 4.1.13}}</ref> a topological space ''X'' is compact if and only if every point ''x'' of the natural extension ''*X'' is [[infinitesimal|infinitely close]] to a point ''x''<sub>0</sub> of ''X'' (more precisely, ''x'' is contained in the [[monad (non-standard analysis)|monad]] of ''x''<sub>0</sub>).\n\n====Hyperreal definition====\nA space ''X'' is compact if its [[hyperreal number|hyperreal extension]] ''*X'' (constructed, for example, by the [[ultrapower construction]]) has the property that every point of ''*X'' is infinitely close to some point of ''X''\u2282''*X''. For example, an open real interval {{nowrap|''X'' {{=}} (0, 1)}} is not compact because its hyperreal extension *(0,1) contains infinitesimals, which are infinitely close to 0, which is not a point of ''X''.\n\n== Properties of compact spaces ==\n\n===Functions and compact spaces===\nA [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] image of a compact space is compact.<ref>{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.2.2}}; See also {{planetmathref|id=4689|title=Compactness is preserved under a continuous map}}</ref>\nThis implies the [[extreme value theorem]]: a continuous real-valued function on a nonempty compact space is bounded above and attains its supremum.<ref>{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Corollary 5.2.1}}</ref> (Slightly more generally, this is true for an upper semicontinuous function.) As a sort of converse to the above statements, the pre-image of a compact space under a [[proper map]] is compact.\n\n===Compact spaces and set operations===\nA closed subset of a compact space is compact,<ref>{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.2.3}}; {{planetmathref|id=4177|title=Closed set in a compact space is compact}}; {{planetmathref|id=4691|title=Closed subsets of a compact set are compact}}</ref> and a finite union of compact sets is compact.\n\nThe [[product topology|product]] of any collection of compact spaces is compact. (This is [[Tychonoff's theorem]], which is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].)\n\nEvery topological space ''X'' is an open [[dense topological subspace|dense subspace]] of a compact space having at most one point more than ''X'', by the [[Compactification (mathematics)|Alexandroff one-point compactification]].  By the same construction, every [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space ''X'' is an open dense subspace of a compact Hausdorff space having at most one point more than ''X''.\n\n===Ordered compact spaces===\nA nonempty compact subset of the [[real number]]s has a greatest element and a least element.\n\nLet ''X'' be a [[total order|simply ordered]] set endowed with the [[order topology]]. Then ''X'' is compact if and only if ''X'' is a [[complete lattice]] (i.e. all subsets have suprema and infima).<ref>{{harv|Steen|Seebach|1995|p=67}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n* Any [[finite topological space]], including the [[empty set]], is compact.  More generally, any space with a [[finite topology]] (only finitely many open sets) is compact; this includes in particular the [[trivial topology]].\n* Any space carrying the [[cofinite topology]] is compact.\n* Any [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space can be turned into a compact space by adding a single point to it, by means of [[Alexandroff one-point compactification]]. The one-point compactification of '''R''' is homeomorphic to the circle '''S'''<sup>1</sup>; the one-point compactification of '''R'''<sup>2</sup> is homeomorphic to the sphere '''S'''<sup>2</sup>. Using the one-point compactification, one can also easily construct compact spaces which are not Hausdorff, by starting with a non-Hausdorff space.\n* The [[right order topology]] or [[left order topology]] on any bounded [[totally ordered set]] is compact. In particular, [[Sierpi\u0144ski space]] is compact.\n* No [[discrete space]] with an infinite number of points is compact. The collection of all [[Singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. Finite discrete spaces are compact.\n* In '''R''' carrying the [[lower limit topology]], no uncountable set is compact.\n* In the [[cocountable topology]] on an uncountable set, no infinite set is compact. Like the previous example, the space as a whole is not [[locally compact]] but is still [[Lindel\u00f6f space|Lindel\u00f6f]].\n* The closed [[unit interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}} is compact. This follows from the [[Heine\u2013Borel theorem]]. The open interval {{open-open|0,1}} is not compact: the [[open cover]] <math>\\left ( \\frac{1}{n}, 1 - \\frac{1}{n} \\right )</math> for {{math|1={{mvar|n}} = 3,\u20094,\u2009\u2026\u2009}} does not have a finite subcover. Similarly, the set of ''[[rational numbers]]'' in the closed interval {{closed-closed|0,1}} is not compact: the sets of rational numbers in the intervals <math>\\left[0,\\frac{1}{\\pi}-\\frac{1}{n}\\right] \\ \\text{and} \\ \\left[\\frac{1}{\\pi}+\\frac{1}{n},1\\right]</math> cover all the rationals in [0,&nbsp;1] for {{math|1={{mvar|n}} = 4,\u20095,\u2009...\u2009}} but this cover does not have a finite subcover. Here, the sets are open in the subspace topology even though they are not open as subsets of&nbsp;'''R'''.\n* The set '''R''' of all real numbers is not compact as there is a cover of open intervals that does not have a finite subcover. For example, intervals {{open-open|{{mvar|n}}\u22121,\u2009{{mvar|n}}+1}}\u2009, where {{mvar|n}} takes all integer values in '''Z''', cover '''R''' but there is no finite subcover.\n* On the other hand, the [[extended real number line]] carrying the analogous topology ''is'' compact; note that the cover described above would never reach the points at infinity.  In fact, the set has the [[homeomorphism]] to [-1,1] of mapping each infinity to its corresponding unit and every real number to its sign multiplied by the unique number in the positive part of interval that results in its absolute value when divided by one minus itself, and since homeomorphisms preserve covers, the Heine-Borel property can be inferred.\n* For every [[natural number]] {{mvar|n}}, the [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]] is compact. Again from the Heine\u2013Borel theorem, the closed unit ball of any finite-dimensional [[normed vector space]] is compact. This is not true for infinite dimensions; in fact, a normed vector space is finite-dimensional if and only if its [[closed unit ball]] is compact.\n* On the other hand, the closed unit ball of the dual of a normed space is compact for the weak-* topology. ([[Alaoglu's theorem]])\n* The [[Cantor set]] is compact. In fact, every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set.\n* Consider the set ''K'' of all functions ''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 [0,1] from the real number line to the closed unit interval, and define a topology on ''K'' so that a sequence <math>\\{f_n\\}</math> in ''K'' converges towards <math>f\\in K</math> if and only if <math>\\{f_n(x)\\}</math> converges towards ''f''(''x'') for all real numbers ''x''. There is only one such topology; it is called the topology of [[pointwise convergence]] or the [[product topology]]. Then ''K'' is a compact topological space; this follows from the [[Tychonoff theorem]].\n* Consider the set ''K'' of all functions ''f''&nbsp;: {{closed-closed|0,1}}&nbsp;\u2192 {{closed-closed|0,1}} satisfying the [[Lipschitz condition]] |''f''(''x'')&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''f''(''y'')|&nbsp;\u2264 |''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''y''| for all ''x'',&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;{{closed-closed|0,1}}.  Consider on ''K''&thinsp; the metric induced by the [[uniform convergence|uniform distance]] <math>d(f,g)=\\sup_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f(x)-g(x)|.</math> Then by [[Arzel\u00e0\u2013Ascoli theorem]] the space ''K'' is compact.\n* The [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of any [[bounded linear operator]] on a [[Banach space]] is a nonempty compact subset of the [[complex number]]s '''C'''. Conversely, any compact subset of '''C''' arises in this manner, as the spectrum of some bounded linear operator. For instance, a diagonal operator on the Hilbert space [[sequence spaces#\u2113p spaces|<math>\\ell^2</math>]] may have any compact nonempty subset of '''C''' as spectrum.\n\n=== Algebraic examples ===\n* [[Compact group]]s such as an [[orthogonal group]] are compact, while groups such as a [[general linear group]] are not.\n* Since the [[p-adic numbers|''p''-adic integers]] are [[homeomorphic]] to the Cantor set, they form a compact set.\n* The [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of any [[commutative ring]] with the [[Zariski topology]] (that is, the set of all prime ideals) is compact, but never [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (except in trivial cases). In algebraic geometry, such topological spaces are examples of quasi-compact [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], \"quasi\" referring to the non-Hausdorff nature of the topology.\n* The [[spectrum of a boolean algebra|spectrum of a Boolean algebra]] is compact, a fact which is part of the [[Stone representation theorem]]. [[Stone space]]s, compact [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]] Hausdorff spaces, form the abstract framework in which these spectra are studied.  Such spaces are also useful in the study of [[profinite group]]s.\n* The [[structure space]] of a commutative unital [[Banach algebra]] is a compact Hausdorff space.\n* The [[Hilbert cube]] is compact, again a consequence of Tychonoff's theorem.\n* A [[profinite group]] (e.g., Galois group) is compact.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Compactly generated space]]\n* [[Eberlein compactum]]\n* [[Exhaustion by compact sets]]\n* [[Lindel\u00f6f space]]\n* [[Metacompact space]]\n* [[Noetherian topological space]]\n* [[Orthocompact space]]\n* [[Paracompact space]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation |last1=Alexandrov |first1=Pavel |authorlink1=Pavel Alexandrov |last2=Urysohn |first2=Pavel |authorlink2=Pavel Urysohn |title=M\u00e9moire sur les espaces topologiques compacts |journal=Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam, Proceedings of the section of mathematical sciences |volume=14 |year=1929}}.\n*{{citation |last1=Arkhangel'skii |first1=A.V. |last2=Fedorchuk |first2=V.V. |contribution=The basic concepts and constructions of general topology |editor1=Arkhangel'skii, A.V. |editor2=Pontrjagin, L.S. |title=General topology I |publisher=Springer |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-387-18178-3 |series=Encyclopedia of the Mathematical Sciences |volume=17}}.\n*{{springer|id=C/c023530|title=Compact space|first=A.V.|last=Arkhangel'skii}}.\n*{{citation |first=Bernard |last=Bolzano |authorlink=Bernard Bolzano |title=Rein analytischer Beweis des Lehrsatzes, dass zwischen je zwey Werthen, die ein entgegengesetzes Resultat gew\u00e4hren, wenigstens eine reele Wurzel der Gleichung liege |year=1817 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EoW4AAAAIAAJ&dq=%22Rein%20analytischer%20Beweis%20des%20Lehrsatzes%22&pg=PA2-IA3#v=onepage&q= |publisher=Wilhelm Engelmann}} (''Purely analytic proof of the theorem that between any two values which give results of opposite sign, there lies at least one real root of the equation'').\n*{{citation |last=Borel |first=\u00c9mile |authorlink=\u00c9mile Borel |title=Sur quelques points de la th\u00e9orie des fonctions |journal=[[Annales Scientifiques de l'\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]|series= 3 |volume=12 |year=1895 |pages=9\u201355 |url=http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=ASENS_1895_3_12__9_0 |jfm=26.0429.03 }}\n*{{Citation | last1=Boyer | first1=Carl B. | author1-link=Carl Benjamin Boyer | title=The history of the calculus and its conceptual development | publisher=Dover Publications | location=New York | mr=0124178 | year=1959}}.\n* {{citation |first=Cesare |last=Arzel\u00e0 |authorlink=Cesare Arzel\u00e0 |title=Sulle funzioni di linee |journal=Mem.

The alternation of ''o'' and ''au'' is characteristic of the Sabine dialect. The [[grammatical gender|feminine form]] is '''Clodia'''.\n\n==Republican era==\n\n===Publius Clodius Pulcher===\n{{main|Publius Clodius Pulcher}}\n<!--the footnote at the end of this section is the source for the entire section-->the [[Roman Republic|Late Republic]], the spelling ''Clodius'' is most prominently associated with [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], a [[populares|popularist]] politician who gave up his patrician status through [[Roman adoption|an order]] in order to qualify for the office of [[tribune#Plebeian tribune|tribune of the ''plebs'']]. Clodius positioned himself as a champion of the urban ''[[plebs]]'', supporting free grain for the poor and the right of association in guilds (''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]]''); because of this individual's ideology, ''Clodius'' has often been taken as a more \"plebeian\" spelling and a gesture of political solidarity. Clodius's two elder brothers, the [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 54 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]] who was [[Roman consul|consul]] in 54 BC and the [[Gaius Claudius Pulcher (praetor 56 BC)|C. Claudius Pulcher]] who was praetor in 56 BC, conducted more conventional political careers and are referred to in contemporary sources with the traditional spelling.\n\nThe view that ''Clodius'' represents a plebeian or politicized form has been questioned by Clodius's chief modern-era biographer. In ''The Patrician Tribune'', W. Jeffrey Tatum points out that the spelling is also associated with Clodius's sisters and that \"the political explanation \u2026 is almost certainly wrong.\" A plebeian branch of the ''gens'', the Claudii Marcelli, retained the supposedly patrician spelling, while there is some [[epigraphy|inscriptional]] evidence that the ''-o-'' form may also have been used on occasion by close male relatives of the \"patrician tribune\" Clodius. Tatum argues that the use of ''-o-'' by the \"chic\" [[Clodia Metelli]] was a fashionable affectation, and that Clodius, whose perhaps inordinately loving relationship with his sister was the subject of much gossip and insinuation, was imitating his stylish sibling. The [[Claudius (gens)#Etymology|linguistic variation of ''o'' for ''au'']] was characteristic of the [[Umbrian language]], of which [[Sabine]] was a branch. Forms using ''o'' were considered archaic or rustic in the 50s BC, and the use of ''Clodius'' would have been either a whimsical gesture of [[pastoral|pastoral fantasy]], or a trendy assertion of [[antiquarianism|antiquarian]] authenticity.<ref>W.

It was during his consulship that the [[second Catilinarian conspiracy]] attempted to overthrow the government through an attack on the city by outside forces, and Cicero suppressed the revolt by summarily and controversially executing five conspirators. During the chaotic latter half of the 1st century BC marked by [[Roman civil wars|civil wars]] and the dictatorship of [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], Cicero championed a return to the traditional [[Roman Republic|republican]] government. Following Julius Caesar's death, Cicero became an enemy of [[Mark Antony]] in the ensuing power struggle, attacking him in a [[Philippicae|series of speeches]]. He was [[Proscription|proscribed]] as an enemy of the state by the [[Second Triumvirate]] and consequently executed by soldiers operating on their behalf in 43 BC after having been intercepted during an attempted flight from the Italian peninsula. His severed hands and head were then, as a final revenge of Mark Antony, displayed in the Roman Forum.\n\n[[Petrarch]]'s rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often credited for initiating the 14th-century [[Renaissance]] in [[Res publica|public affairs]], [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]], and classical Roman culture.<ref name=\"Wootton1996\">{{cite book |last=Wootton |first=David |title=Modern Political Thought: Readings from Machiavelli to Nietzsche|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=78eaIfCg2mcC|accessdate=27 August 2013|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=978-0-87220-341-9|page=1}}</ref> According to Polish historian [[Tadeusz Stefan Zieli\u0144ski|Tadeusz Zieli\u0144ski]], \"the Renaissance was above all things a revival of Cicero, and only after him and through him of the rest of Classical antiquity.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Zieli\u0144ski |first=Tadeusz |title=Cicero Im Wandel Der Jahrhunderte |publisher=Nabu Press}}</ref> The peak of Cicero's authority and prestige came during the 18th-century Enlightenment,<ref>{{cite book|first=Neal|last=Wood |title=Cicero's Social and Political Thought |publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1991|isbn=978-0-520-07427-9}}</ref> and his impact on leading Enlightenment thinkers and political theorists such as [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Montesquieu]] and [[Edmund Burke]] was substantial.<ref>{{cite web|first=Walter|last=Nicgorski |title=Cicero and the Natural Law |publisher=Natural Law, Natural Rights, and American Constitutionalism|url=http://www.nlnrac.org/classical/cicero}}</ref>\nHis works rank among the most influential in European culture, and today still constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for the writing and revision of Roman history, especially the last days of the [[Roman Republic]].<ref>{{cite book\n |first=Miriam |last=Griffin\n|first2=John |last2=Boardman |first3=Jasper |last3=Griffin |first4=Oswyn |last4=Murray\n |title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Roman World\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w95Nb-BJWRcC&pg=PA76\n|accessdate=10 August 2011\n|date=15 January 2001\n|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n|isbn=978-0-19-285436-0\n|pages=76ff}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n{{Main article|Personal life of Cicero}}\n\n===Early life===\n\nCicero was born in 106 BC in [[Arpinum]], a hill town {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} southeast of Rome. He belonged to the ''[[Roman tribe|tribus]]'' Cornelia.<ref>''Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum,'' [http://www.attalus.org/docs/sig2/s747.html 747].</ref> His father was a well-to-do member of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian order]] and possessed good connections in Rome.  However, being a semi-invalid, he could not enter public life and studied extensively to compensate. Although little is known about Cicero's mother, Helvia, it was common for the wives of important Roman citizens to be responsible for the management of the household. Cicero's brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]] wrote in a letter that she was a thrifty housewife.<ref>Rawson, E.: ''Cicero, a portrait'' (1975) pp. 5\u20136; Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Fam.+16.26.2 16.26.2] (Quintus to Cicero)</ref>\n\nCicero's [[cognomen]], or personal surname, comes from the Latin for [[chickpea]], ''cicer''. [[Plutarch]] explains that the name was originally given to one of Cicero's ancestors who had a cleft in the tip of his nose resembling a chickpea. However, it is more likely that Cicero's ancestors prospered through the cultivation and sale of chickpeas.<ref>Trollope, Anthony. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8945/8945-h/8945-h.htm The Life of Cicero]'' Volume 1. p. 42</ref> Romans often chose down-to-earth personal surnames. The famous family names of [[Fabia (gens)|Fabius]], [[Lentulus]], and [[Piso]] come from the Latin names of beans, lentils, and peas, respectively. Plutarch writes that Cicero was urged to change this deprecatory name when he entered politics, but refused, saying that he would make ''Cicero'' more glorious than ''[[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Scaurus]]'' (\"Swollen-ankled\") and ''[[Gaius Lutatius Catulus|Catulus]]'' (\"Puppy\").<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#1.3 1.3\u20135]</ref>\n\n[[File:The Young Cicero Reading.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Young Cicero Reading]]'' by [[Vincenzo Foppa]] (fresco, 1464), now at the [[Wallace Collection]]]]\n\nDuring this period in Roman history, \"cultured\" meant being able to speak both Latin and Greek. Cicero was therefore educated in the teachings of the ancient Greek philosophers, poets and historians; as he obtained much of his understanding of the theory and practice of [[rhetoric]] from the Greek poet [[Aulus Licinius Archias|Archias]]<ref>[[Anthony Everitt|Everitt, A.]]:\"Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician\" (2001) p.34</ref> and from the Greek [[rhetoric]]ian [[Apollonius Molon|Apollonius]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/caesar*.html|title=Life of Caesar|last=Plutarch|first=|date=|website=[[University of Chicago]]|publisher=|page=447|access-date=|quote=After this, Sulla's power being now on the wane, and Caesar's friends at home inviting him to return, Caesar sailed to Rhodes to study under Apollonius the son of Molon, an illustrious rhetorician with the reputation of a worthy character, of whom Cicero also was a pupil.}}</ref> Cicero used his knowledge of Greek to translate many of the theoretical concepts of Greek philosophy into Latin, thus translating Greek philosophical works for a larger audience. It was precisely his broad education that tied him to the traditional Roman elite.<ref>Everitt, A.: \"Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician\" (2001) p. 35</ref>\n\nAccording to Plutarch, Cicero was an extremely talented student, whose learning attracted attention from all over Rome,<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#2.2 2.2]</ref> affording him the opportunity to study Roman law under [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur|Quintus Mucius Scaevola]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#3.2 3.2]</ref> Cicero's fellow students were Gaius Marius Minor, [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]] (who became a famous lawyer, one of the few whom Cicero considered superior to himself in legal matters), and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Titus Pomponius]]. The latter two became Cicero's friends for life, and Pomponius (who later received the nickname \"Atticus\", and whose sister married Cicero's brother) would become, in Cicero's own words, \"as a second brother\", with both maintaining a lifelong correspondence.<ref>Everitt, A.: \"Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician\" (2001) p. 35</ref>\n\nCicero wanted to pursue a public career in politics along the steps of the [[Cursus honorum]]. In 90\u201388 BC, he served both [[Pompeius Strabo]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] as they campaigned in the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]], though he had no taste for military life, being an intellectual first and foremost. Cicero started his career as a lawyer around 83\u201381 BC. His first major case, of which a written record is still extant, was his 80 BC defense of [[Sextus Roscius]] on the charge of [[patricide]].<ref>Rawson, E.: \"Cicero, a portrait\" (1975) p. 22</ref> Taking this case was a courageous move for Cicero; patricide was considered an appalling crime, and the people whom Cicero accused of the murder, the most notorious being [[Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus|Chrysogonus]], were favorites of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix|Sulla]]. At this time it would have been easy for Sulla to have the unknown Cicero murdered. Cicero's defense was an indirect challenge to the dictator Sulla, and on the strength of his case, Roscius was acquitted.<ref>Everitt, A.: \"Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician\" (2001) p. 61</ref>\n\n[[Pro Roscio Amerino|Cicero's case]] was divided into three parts. The first part detailed exactly the charge brought by Ericius. Cicero explained how a rustic son of a farmer, who lives off the pleasures of his own land, would not have gained anything from committing patricide because he would have eventually inherited his father's land anyway. The second part concerned the boldness and greed of two of the accusers, Magnus and Capito. Cicero told the jury that they were the more likely perpetrators of murder because the two were greedy, both for conspiring together against a fellow kinsman and, in particular, Magnus, for his boldness and for being unashamed to appear in court to support the false charges. The third part explained that Chrysogonus had immense political power, and the accusation was successfully made due to that power. Even though Chrysogonus may not have been what Cicero said he was, through rhetoric Cicero successfully made him appear to be a foreign freed man who prospered by devious means in the aftermath of the civil war. Cicero surmised that it showed what kind of a person he was and that something like murder was not beneath him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vasaly|first=Ann|title=Representation: Images of the World in a Ciceronian Territory|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520077553|pages=158\u201368|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzEzMTI1X19BTg2?sid=c9ee3429-cd2e-4d40-9f34-5b332f61d12a@sessionmgr114&vid=1&format=EB&lpid=lp_156&rid=0|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140306005520/http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzEzMTI1X19BTg2?sid=c9ee3429-cd2e-4d40-9f34-5b332f61d12a@sessionmgr114&vid=1&format=EB&lpid=lp_156&rid=0|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-03-06|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nCicero's interest in philosophy figured heavily in his later career and led to him providing a comprehensive account of Greek philosophy for a Roman audience,<ref>De Officiis, book 1, n. 1</ref> including creating a philosophical vocabulary in Latin.<ref>Everitt, A.:\" Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician\" (2001) pp. 253\u201355</ref> In 87 BC, [[Philo of Larissa]], the head of the Academy that was founded by [[Plato]] in Athens about 300 years earlier, arrived in Rome.

According to the upper class [[wikt:mores#English|mores]] of the day it was a marriage of convenience, but lasted harmoniously for nearly 30 years. Terentia's family was wealthy, probably the [[Plebs|plebeian]] noble house of Terenti Varrones, thus meeting the needs of Cicero's political ambitions in both economic and social terms. She had a half-sister named Fabia, who as a child had become a [[Vestal Virgin]], a very great honour. Terentia was a strong willed woman and (citing Plutarch) \"she took more interest in her husband's political career than she allowed him to take in household affairs.\"<ref>Rawson, E.: \"Cicero, a portrait\" (1975) p. 25</ref>\n\nIn the 50s BC, Cicero's letters to Terentia became shorter and colder. He complained to his friends that Terentia had betrayed him but did not specify in which sense. Perhaps the marriage simply could not outlast the strain of the political upheaval in Rome, Cicero's involvement in it, and various other disputes between the two. The divorce appears to have taken place in 51 BC or shortly before.<ref>Susan Treggiari, ''Terentia, Tullia and Publilia: the women of Cicero's family'', London: Routledge, 2007, pp. 76ff.</ref> In 46 or 45 BC,<ref>Treggiari, op. cit., p. 133</ref> Cicero married a young girl, Publilia, who had been his [[ward (law)|ward]].

Cicero sent him to Athens to study as a disciple of the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosopher [[Cratippus of Pergamon|Kratippos]] in 48 BC, but he used this absence from \"his father's vigilant eye\" to \"eat, drink and be merry.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Haskell|first=H.J|title=This was Cicero|year=1964|pages=103\u201304}}</ref> After Cicero's murder he joined the army of the ''[[Liberatores]]'' but was later pardoned by [[Augustus]].

He became an [[augur]], and was nominated [[Roman consul|consul]] in 30 BC together with Augustus. As such, he was responsible for revoking the honors of [[Mark Antony]], who was responsible for the proscription, and could in this way take revenge.

Cicero served as quaestor in western [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]] in 75 BC and demonstrated honesty and integrity in his dealings with the inhabitants. As a result, the grateful Sicilians asked Cicero to prosecute [[Gaius Verres]], a governor of Sicily, who had badly plundered the province. His prosecution of Gaius Verres was a great forensic success<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Oxford illustrated history of the Roman world\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w95Nb-BJWRcC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20Oxford%20illustrated%20history%20of%20the%20Roman%20world&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=extortionate&f=false\n|accessdate=10 August 2011\n|pages=84ff|isbn=9780192854360\n|last1=Boardman\n|first1=John\n|date=2001-01-18\n}}</ref> for Cicero. Governor Gaius Verres hired the prominent lawyer of a noble family [[Quintus Hortensius|Quintus Hortensius Hortalus]]. After a lengthy period in Sicily collecting testimonials and evidence and persuading witnesses to come forward, Cicero returned to Rome and won the case in a series of dramatic court battles. His unique style of oratory set him apart from the flamboyant Hortensius. On the conclusion of this case, Cicero came to be considered the greatest orator in Rome. The view that Cicero may have taken the case for reasons of his own is viable. Hortensius was, at this point, known as the best lawyer in Rome; to beat him would guarantee much success and the prestige that Cicero needed to start his career. Cicero's oratorical skill is shown in his [[character assassination]] of Verres and various other techniques of persuasion used on the jury. One such example is found in the speech ''[[In Verrem|Against Verres I]]'', where he states \"with you on this bench, gentlemen, with [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 67 BC)|Marcus Acilius Glabrio]] as your president, I do not understand what Verres can hope to achieve\".<ref>Trans. Grant, Michael. Cicero: Selected Works. London: Penguin Books. 1960.</ref> Oratory was considered a great art in ancient Rome and an important tool for disseminating knowledge and promoting oneself in elections, in part because there were no regular newspapers or mass media. Cicero was neither a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] nor a plebeian [[nobiles|noble]]; his rise to political office despite his relatively humble origins has traditionally been attributed to his brilliance as an orator.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/268/2/11.html III.

The World's Famous Orations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nCicero grew up in a time of civil unrest and war. [[Sulla]]'s victory in the first of a series of civil wars led to a new constitutional framework that undermined ''[[libertas]]'' (liberty), the fundamental value of the Roman Republic. Nonetheless, Sulla's reforms strengthened the position of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] class, contributing to that class's growing political power. Cicero was both an Italian ''eques'' and a ''[[novus homo]]'', but more importantly he was a [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitutionalist]]. His social class and loyalty to the Republic ensured that he would \"command the support and confidence of the people as well as the Italian middle classes\". The ''[[optimates]]'' faction never truly accepted Cicero; and this undermined his efforts to reform the Republic while preserving the constitution. Nevertheless, he successfully ascended the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', holding each magistracy at or near the youngest possible age: [[quaestor]] in 75 BC (age 31), [[aedile]] in 69 BC (age 37), and [[praetor]] in 66 BC (age 40), when he served as president of the \"Reclamation\" (or extortion) Court. He was then elected [[Roman consul|consul]] at age 43.\n\n===Consul===\n[[File:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Cicero Denounces Catiline'', [[fresco]] by [[Cesare Maccari]], 1882\u201388]]\nCicero was elected consul for the year 63 BC. His co-consul for the year, [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida]], played a minor role. During his year in office, he thwarted a conspiracy centered on assassinating him and overthrowing the [[Roman Republic]] with the help of foreign armed forces, led by [[Catiline|Lucius Sergius Catilina]]. Cicero procured a ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' (a&nbsp;declaration of [[martial law]]) and drove Catiline from the city with four vehement speeches (the [[Catiline Orations]]), which to this day remain outstanding examples of his rhetorical style. The Orations listed Catiline and his followers' debaucheries, and denounced Catiline's senatorial sympathizers as roguish and dissolute debtors clinging to Catiline as a final and desperate hope. Cicero demanded that Catiline and his followers leave the city. At the conclusion of his first speech, Catiline hurriedly left the Senate, (which was being held in the [[Temple of Jupiter Stator (8th century BC)|Temple of Jupiter Stator]]). In his following speeches, Cicero did not directly address Catiline. He delivered <!--maybe; some scholars think not all the Catilinarians were actually delivered, but were rather published-->the second and third orations before the [[SPQR|people]], and the last one again before the Senate. By these speeches, Cicero wanted to prepare the Senate for the worst possible case; he also delivered more evidence against Catiline.<ref>Cicero, Marcus Tullius, Selected Works, Penguin Books Ltd, Great Britain, 1971</ref>\n\nCatiline fled and left behind his followers to start the revolution from within while Catiline assaulted the city with an army of \"moral bankrupts and honest fanatics\". Catiline had attempted to involve the [[Allobroges]], a tribe of [[Transalpine Gaul]], in their plot, but Cicero, working with the Gauls, was able to seize letters that incriminated the five conspirators and forced them to confess in front of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].<ref>Cicero, ''In Catilinam'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin//ptext?lookup=Cic.+Catil.+3.4 3.2] {{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (at the Perseus Project); Sallust, ''Bellum Catilinae'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#40 40\u201345] (at Lacus Curtius); Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#18.4 18.4] (at Lacus Curtius).</ref>\n\nThe Senate then deliberated upon the conspirators' punishment. As it was the dominant advisory body to the various [[legislative]] assemblies rather than a [[judicial]] body, there were limits to its power; however, martial law was in effect, and it was feared that simple house arrest or exile&nbsp;\u2013 the standard options&nbsp;\u2013 would not remove the threat to the state. At first [[Decimus Junius Silanus (translator of Mago)|Decimus Silanus]] spoke for the \"extreme penalty\"; many were swayed by Julius Caesar, who decried the precedent it would set and argued in favor of life imprisonment in various Italian towns. [[Cato the Younger]] rose in defence of the death penalty and the entire Senate finally agreed on the matter. Cicero had the conspirators taken to the [[Tullianum]], the notorious Roman prison, where they were strangled. Cicero himself accompanied the former consul [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura]], one of the conspirators, to the Tullianum. Cicero received the honorific \"''[[Pater Patriae]]''\" for his efforts to suppress the conspiracy, but lived thereafter in fear of trial or exile for having put Roman citizens to death without trial.\n\nAfter the conspirators were put to death, Cicero was proud of his accomplishment. Some of his political enemies argued that though the act gained Cicero popularity, he exaggerated the extent of his success. He overestimated his popularity again several years later after being exiled from Italy and then allowed back from exile. At this time, he claimed that [[Roman Republic|the Republic]] would be restored along with him.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clayton|first=Edward|title=Cicero (106\u201343 BC)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/cicero/#H2|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nJust after completing his consulship, in late 62 BC, Cicero arranged the purchase of a large townhouse on the [[Palatine Hill]] previously owned by Rome's richest citizen, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]].

Cicero, having executed members of the Catiline Conspiracy four years previously without formal trial, and having had a public falling out with Clodius, was clearly the intended target of the law. Cicero argued that the ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' indemnified him from punishment, and he attempted to gain the support of the senators and consuls, especially of Pompey. When help was not forthcoming, he went into exile.

Cicero returned to Italy on 5 August 57&nbsp;BC, landing at [[Brundisium]].<ref>Cicero, ''Samtliga brev/Collected letters'' (in a Swedish translation)</ref> He was greeted by a cheering crowd, and, to his delight, his beloved daughter [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia]].<ref>Haskell.

It is uncertain whether he was directly involved in politics for the following few years.<ref>Grant, M: \"Cicero: Selected Works\", p. 67</ref>\n\n===Governorship of Cilicia===\nIn 51 BC he reluctantly accepted a [[Promagistrate|promagistracy]] in [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Cilicia]] for the year, because there were few other eligible [[Roman governor|governors]] available as a result of a legislative requirement enacted by Pompey in 52&nbsp;BC, specifying an interval of five years between a consulship or praetorship and a [[Roman province|provincial command]].<ref>Everitt, A. \"Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician\" (2001), pp. 186\u201388</ref> He served as [[proconsul]] of Cilicia from May 51 to November 50&nbsp;BC. He was given instructions to keep nearby [[Cappadocia]] loyal to the King, [[Ariobarzanes III of Cappadocia|Ariobarzanes III]], which he achieved 'satisfactorily without war.' Rome's defeat by the [[Parthian Empire]] and an uprising in Syria caused disquiet in Cilicia. Cicero restored calm by his mild system of government.  He discovered that much of public property had been embezzled by corrupt previous governors and their staffs, and did his utmost to restore it. Thus he greatly improved the condition of the cities.<ref>[[Alfred John Church]], ''Roman Life in the Days of Cicero'', (Kindle edition), ch. XIII., loc. 1834</ref> He retained the civil rights of, and exempted from penalties, the men who gave the property back.<ref>Church, loc. 1871</ref> Besides this, he was extremely frugal in his outlays for staff and private expenses during his governorship, and this made him highly popular among the natives.<ref>Church, loc. 1834</ref> Previous governors had extorted enormous sums from the provincials in order to supply their households and bodyguard. Besides his activity in ameliorating the hard pecuniary situation of the province, Cicero was also creditably active in the military sphere. Early in his governorship he received information that [[Pacorus I|Pacorus]], son of the king of Parthia who had destroyed [[Marcus Licinus Crassus|Crassus]]' army at the [[battle of Carrhae]] two years previously, had crossed the [[Euphrates]] at the head of his hordes, and was besieging [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] (the interim Roman commander in Syria) in [[Antioch]].<ref>Church, loc. 1845</ref> Cicero marched with 15,000 soldiers (two legions with auxiliary cavalry) to Cassius' relief, and Pacorus retreated, suffering a reverse from the pursuing Cassius in his retreat. Cicero next defeated some robbers who were based on [[Nur Mountains|Mount Amanus]] and was hailed by his soldiers as [[imperator]] on the field of battle. Afterwards he led his army against the independent Cilcian mountain tribes, besieging their fortress of [[Pindenissum]]. It took him 47 days to reduce the place, which fell in December.<ref>Church, loc. 1855</ref> Then Cicero left the province to his brother [[Quintus Cicero|Quintus]], who had accompanied him on his governorship as his lieutenant.<ref>Church, ibid</ref> On his way back to Rome he stopped in [[Rhodes]]. He then spent some time in [[Athens]], where he caught up with an old friend from his previous stay there and met men of great learning.<ref>Plutarch, The Life of Cicero, 36</ref>\n\n===Julius Caesar's civil war===\nThe struggle between [[Pompey]] and Julius Caesar grew more intense in 50 BC. Cicero favoured Pompey, seeing him as a defender of the senate and Republican tradition, but at that time avoided openly alienating Caesar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/caesar*.html|title=Life of Caesar|last=Plutarch|first=|date=|website=University of Chicago|publisher=|page=575|access-date=|quote=It was Cicero who proposed the first honours for [Caesar] in the senate, and their magnitude was, after all, not too great for a man; but others added excessive honours and vied with one another in proposing them, thus rendering Caesar odious and obnoxious even to the mildest citizens because of the pretension and extravagance of what was decreed for him.}}</ref> When Caesar invaded Italy in 49 BC, Cicero fled Rome. Caesar, seeking an endorsement by a senior senator, courted Cicero's favour, but even so Cicero slipped out of Italy and traveled to Dyrrachium ([[Epidamnos]]), Illyria, where Pompey's staff was situated.<ref>Everitt, Anthony: ''Cicero'' p. 215.</ref> Cicero traveled with the Pompeian forces to [[Pharsalus]] in 48 BC,<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#38 38.1]</ref> though he was quickly losing faith in the competence and righteousness of the Pompeian side. Eventually, he provoked the hostility of his fellow senator [[Cato the Younger|Cato]], who told him that he would have been of more use to the cause of the ''optimates'' if he had stayed in Rome. After Caesar's victory at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] on 9 August, Cicero returned to Rome only very cautiously. Caesar pardoned him and Cicero tried to adjust to the situation and maintain his political work, hoping that Caesar might revive the Republic and its institutions.\n\nIn a letter to [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] on c. 20 April 46 BC, Cicero outlined his strategy under Caesar's dictatorship. Cicero, however, was taken completely by surprise when the ''[[Liberatores]]'' assassinated Caesar on the [[ides of March]], 44 BC. Cicero was not included in the conspiracy, even though the conspirators were sure of his sympathy. [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]] called out Cicero's name, asking him to restore the republic when he lifted his bloodstained dagger after the assassination.<ref>Cicero, ''Second Philippic'' Against Antony</ref> A letter Cicero wrote in February 43 BC to [[Trebonius]], one of the conspirators, began, \"How I could wish that you had invited me to that most glorious banquet on the [[Ides of March]]\"!<ref>Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/fam10.shtml#28 10.28]</ref> Cicero became a popular leader during the period of instability following the assassination. He had no respect for [[Mark Antony]], who was scheming to take revenge upon Caesar's murderers. In exchange for amnesty for the assassins, he arranged for the Senate to agree not to declare Caesar to have been a [[tyrant]], which allowed the Caesarians to have lawful support and kept Caesar's reforms and policies intact.<ref>Cecil W.

Relations between the two, never friendly, worsened after Cicero claimed that Antony was taking liberties in interpreting Caesar's wishes and intentions.  [[Augustus|Octavian]] was Caesar's adopted son and heir. After he returned to Italy, Cicero began to play him against Antony.

The speech of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Piso]], Caesar's father-in-law, delayed proceedings against Antony. Antony was later declared an [[enemy of the state]] when he refused to lift the siege of [[Mutina]], which was in the hands of Decimus Brutus. Cicero's plan to drive out Antony failed. Antony and Octavian reconciled and allied with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]] to form the [[Second Triumvirate]] after the successive battles of [[Battle of Forum Gallorum|Forum Gallorum]] and [[Battle of Mutina|Mutina]]. The Triumvirate began [[proscription|proscribing]] their enemies and potential rivals immediately after legislating the alliance into official existence for a term of five years with consular ''[[imperium]]''.

[[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' novels ''[[Imperium (Harris novel)|Imperium]]'', ''[[Lustrum (novel)|Lustrum]]'' (published under the name ''Conspirata'' in the United States) and ''[[Dictator (Harris novel)|Dictator]]'' is the three-part novel series based upon the life of Cicero. In these novels Cicero's character is depicted in a more balanced way than in those of McCullough, with his positive traits equaling or outweighing his weaknesses (while conversely Caesar is depicted as more sinister than in McCullough).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Cicero is a major recurring character in the ''[[Roma Sub Rosa]]'' series of mystery novels by [[Steven Saylor]]. He also appears several times as a peripheral character in [[John Maddox Roberts]]' [[SPQR series|''SPQR'' series]]. The protagonist, [[Decius Metellus]], admires Cicero for his erudition, but is disappointed by his lack of real opposition to Caesar, as well as puzzled by his relentless fawning on the ''Optimates'', who secretly despise Cicero as a [[parvenu]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[A Dialogue Concerning Oratorical Partitions]]''\n* [[Caecilia Attica]]\n* [[Caecilia Metella (daughter of Metellus Celer)]]\n* ''[[Civis romanus sum]]''\n* [[Clausula (rhetoric)]]\n* ''[[E pluribus unum]]''\n* ''[[Esse quam videri]]''\n* ''[[Ipse dixit]]''\n* [[List of ancient Romans]]\n* [[Marcantonius Majoragio]]\n* [[Marcus Tullius Tiro]]\n* [[Marius Nizolius]]\n* [[Novus homo]]\n* ''[[O tempora o mores!]]''\n* [[Otium]]\n* [[Quintus Tullius Cicero]]\n* [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]]\n* [[Tempest in a teapot]]\n* [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]]\n* [[Translation#Western theory|Translation]]\n* [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* [[E.

''cos.''; [[Latin]] plural ''consules'') was the title of one of the chief [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]] of the [[Roman Republic]], and subsequently a somewhat significant title under the [[Roman Empire]]. The title was used in other European [[city state]]s through antiquity and the Middle Ages, then revived in modern [[State (polity)|states]], notably in the [[First French Republic]]. The relating adjective is '''consular''', from the  ''[[consularis]]''.\n\nThis usage contrasts with modern terminology, where a consul is a [[Consul (representative)|type of diplomat]].\n{{main article|Consul (representative)}} \n\n==Roman consul==\n{{main article|Roman consul}}\nA consul held the highest elected political office of the [[Roman Republic]] (509 to 27 BC), and ancient Romans considered the consulship the highest level of the [[cursus honorum]] (an ascending sequence of public offices to which politicians aspired).\n\n===See also ===\n* Chronological listings of Roman consuls (in law always republican Magistrates):\n** [[List of Roman Consuls|List of Roman consuls]]\n* [[List of topics related to ancient Rome]]\n* [[Pauly\u2013Wissowa]]\n* [[Political institutions of Rome]]\n* [[Hypatos]]\n\n==Other uses in antiquity==\n\n===Private sphere===\nIt was not uncommon for an organization under Roman private law to copy the terminology of state and city institutions for its own statutory agents. The founding statute, or contract, of such an organisation was called ''lex'', 'law'. The people elected each year were [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], members of the upper class.\n\n===City states===\nWhile many cities (as in Gaul) had a double-headed chief magistracy, often another [[title]] was used, such as ''Duumvir'' or native styles such as ''Meddix'', but ''consul'' was used in some.\n\n==Medieval city states, communes and municipalities==\nThroughout most of southern [[Kingdom of France|France]], a consul ({{lang-fr|consul}} or ''{{lang|fr|consule}}'') was an office equivalent to the {{Interlanguage link multi|\u00c9chevin (France)|fr|3=\u00c9chevin|lt=\u00e9chevins}} of the north and roughly similar with [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[alderman|aldermen]]. The most prominent were those of [[Bordeaux]] and [[Toulouse]], which came to be known as [[jurat]]s and [[capitoul]]s, respectively. The capitouls of Toulouse were granted transmittable nobility. In many other smaller towns the first consul, was the equivalent of a mayor today, assisted by a variable number of secondary consuls and jurats. His main task was to levy and collect tax.\n\nThe [[Duke]]s of [[Gaeta]] often used also the title of \"consul\" in its Greek form \"[[Hypatos]]\" (see [[List of Hypati and Dukes of Gaeta]]).\n\nThe city-state of [[Genoa]], unlike ancient Rome, bestowed the title of ''consul'' on various state officials, not necessarily restricted to the highest. Among these were Genoese officials stationed in various Mediterranean ports, whose role included helping Genoese merchants and sailors in difficulties with the local authorities. This institution, with its name, was later emulated by other powers and is reflected in the modern usage of the word (see [[Consul (representative)]]).\n\n==French Revolution==\n\n===French Republic 1799-1804===\n{{main article|French Consulate}}\n[[File:3consuls.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A portrait of the three consuls, [[Jean Jacques R\u00e9gis de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun, duc de Plaisance|Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun]] (left to right)]]\n\nAfter [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] [[18 Brumaire|staged a coup]] against the [[French Directory|Directory]] government in November 1799, the French Republic adopted a [[Constitution of the Year VIII|constitution]] which conferred executive powers upon three consuls, elected for a period of ten years. In reality, the first consul, Bonaparte, dominated his two colleagues and held supreme power, soon making himself consul for life (1802) and eventually, in 1804, [[First French Empire|emperor]].\n\nThe office was held by:\n\n* [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Emmanuel-Joseph Siey\u00e8s]], [[Roger Ducos]], provisional consuls (10 November \u2013 12 December 1799)\n* [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (first consul), [[Jean Jacques R\u00e9gis de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s|Jean-Jacques Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s]] (second consul), [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun, duc de Plaisance|Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun]] (third consul), consuls (12 December 1799 \u2013 18 May 1804)\n\n===Bolognese Republic, 1796===\nThe short-lived [[Bolognese Republic]], proclaimed in 1796 as a [[French client republic]] in the Central Italian city of [[Bologna]], had a government consisting of nine consuls and its head of state was the ''Presidente del Magistrato'', i.e., [[chief magistrate]], a presiding office held for four months by one of the consuls. Bologna already had consuls at some parts of its Medieval history.\n\n===Roman Republic, 1798\u20131800===\nThe French-sponsored [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (15 February 1798 \u2013 23 June 1800) was headed by multiple consuls:\n* Francesco Riganti, Carlo Luigi Costantini, Duke Bonelli-Crescenzi, Antonio Bassi, Gioacchino Pessuti, Angelo Stampa, Domenico Maggi, provisional consuls (15 February \u2013 20 March 1798)\n* [[Liborio Angelucci]], Giacomo De Mattheis, Panazzi, Reppi, [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]], consuls (20 March \u2013 September 1798)\n* Brigi, Calisti, Francesco Pierelli, Giuseppe Rey, Federico Maria Domenico Michele, Zaccaleoni, consuls (September \u2013 24 July 1799)\n\nConsular rule was interrupted by the [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] occupation (27 November \u2013 12 December 1798), which installed a Provisional Government:\n* Prince Giambattista [[Borghese]], Prince Paolo-Maria [[Aldobrandini]], Prince Gibrielli, Marchese Camillo Massimo, Giovanni Ricci (29 November 1798 - 12 December 1798)\n\nRome was occupied by France (11 July \u2013 28 September 1799) and again by Naples (30 September 1799 \u2013 23 June 1800), bringing an end to the Roman Republic.\n\n==Revolutionary Greece, 1821==\nAmong the many petty local republics that were formed during the first year of the [[Greek Revolution]], prior to the creation of a unified Provisional Government at the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus]], were:\n* The Consulate of [[Argos]] (from 26 May 1821, under the Senate of the [[Peloponnese]]) had a ''single'' head of state, styled consul, 28 March 1821 \u2013 26 May 1821: Stamatellos Antonopoulos\n* The Consulate of East Greece ([[Livadeia]]) (from 15 November 1821, under the [[Areopagus of Eastern Continental Greece|Areopagus of East Greece]]) was headed 1 April 1821 \u2013 15 November 1821 by three consuls: Lambros Nakos, Ioannis Logothetis & Ioannis Filon\n''Note: in [[Greek language|Greek]], the term for \"consul\" is \"hypatos\" (\u1f55\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), which translates as \"supreme one\", and hence does not necessarily imply a joint office.''\n\n==Paraguay, 1813\u20131844==\nIn between a series of [[Junta (governing body)|juntas]] and various other short-lived regimes, the [[Paraguay#Independence and rule of Francia|young republic]] was governed by \"consuls of the republic\", with two consuls alternating in power every 4 months:\n* 12 October 1813 \u2013 12 February 1814, [[ Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia y Velasco]]\n* 12 February 1814 \u2013 12 June 1814, [[Fulgencio Yegros y Franco de Torres]]\n* 12 June 1814 \u2013 3 October 1814, Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia y Velasco; he stayed on as \"[[Supreme Dictator|supreme dictator]]\" 3 October 1814 \u2013 20 September 1840 (from 6 June 1816 styled \"perpetual supreme dictator\")\n\nAfter a few presidents of the [[Provisional Junta]], there were again consuls of the republic, 14 March 1841 \u2013 13 March 1844 (ruling jointly, but occasionally styled \"first consul\", \"second consul\"): [[Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez Ynsfr\u00e1n]] (b. 1792 \u2013 d. 1862) + [[Mariano Roque Alonzo Romero]] (d. 1853) (the lasts of the aforementioned juntistas, Commandant-General of the Army)\nThereafter all republican rulers were styled \"president\".\n\n==Modern uses of the term==\n{{Main|Consul (representative)}}\nIn modern terminology, a consul is a [[Consul (representative)|type of diplomat]].  The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' defines '''consul''' as \"an official appointed by a government to reside in a foreign country and represent its interests there.\"\n\nIn most governments, the consul is the head of the consular section of an embassy, and is responsible for all consular services such as immigrant and non-immigrant visas, passports, and citizen services for expatriates living or traveling in the host country.\n\n{{Main|Administrative consul}}\nA less common modern usage is when the consul of one country takes a governing role in the host country.\n\n==See also==\nDifferently named, but same function\n* [[Captain Regent]] (similar modern position in San Marino's government)\n* [[Consularis]] (Roman gubernatorial style)\n\nModern UN System \n* [[Consulate]]\n\n==Sources and references==\n* [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/ WorldStatesmen.org], see each present country\n\n[[Category:Ancient Roman titles]]\n[[Category:Heads of government]]\n[[Category:Heads of state]]\n[[Category:Military ranks of ancient Rome]]\n[[Category:Latin political phrases]]\n[[Category:Collective heads of state]]\n[[Category:Cursus honorum]]\n[[Category:Diplomats by role]]\n\n[[cs:Konzul (antick\u00fd \u0158\u00edm)]]\n[[hr:Konzul]]\n[[io:Konsulo]]\n[[ku:Kons\u00fbl]]\n[[sr:\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0437\u0443\u043b]]\n[[tl:Konsulado]]", "sha1": "2m0rvjqv8hyzql8sf0yguhma9tu049w"}}, {"title": "List of equations in classical mechanics", "ns": "0", "id": "6050", "revision": {"id": "863818357", "parentid": "855561832", "timestamp": "2018-10-13T07:51:26Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2402:8100:3028:9D42:90CF:8F99:C100:F25A"}, "comment": "/* Mechanical oscillators */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[Classical mechanics]] is the branch of [[physics]] used to describe the motion of [[macroscopic]] objects.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mayer|Sussman|Wisdom|2001|p=xiii}}</ref> It is the most familiar of the theories of physics.

It was designed for men of [[Roman senate|senatorial]] rank. The cursus honorum comprised a mixture of military and political administration posts. Each office had a minimum age for election. There were minimum intervals between holding successive offices and laws forbade repeating an office.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThese rules were altered and flagrantly ignored in the course of the last century of the Republic. For example, [[Gaius Marius]] held [[Roman consul|consulships]] for five years in a row between 104 BC and 100 BC. He held consulship a total of seven times, also serving 86, and 107 BC. Officially presented as opportunities for public service, the offices often became mere opportunities for self-aggrandizement. The reforms of [[Sulla]] required a ten-year period between holding another term in the same office.<ref>{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Frank Frost |author-link=Frank Frost Abbott |year=1901 |title=A History and Description of Roman Political Institutions |publisher=[[Ginn and Company]] |isbn=0-543-92749-0 |page=105 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924011040338#page/n115}}</ref>\n\nTo have held each office at the youngest possible age (''suo anno,'' \"in his year\") was considered a great political success, since to miss out on a praetorship at 39 meant that one could not become consul at 42.  [[Cicero]] expressed extreme pride not only in being a ''[[novus homo]]'' (\"new man\"; comparable to a \"[[self-made man]]\") who became consul even though none of his ancestors had ever served as a consul, but also in having become consul \"in his year\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Marcus Tullius Cicero |author-link=Marcus Tullius Cicero |author2=Sallust |author2-link=Sallust |last3=Johnston |first3=Harold Whetstone |author3-link=Harold Whetstone Johnston |last4=Kingery |first4=Hugh Macmaster |year=1910 |title=Selected orations and letters of Cicero: To which is added the Catiline of Sallust ; with historical introduction, an outline of the Roman constitution, notes, vocabulary and index |location=Chicago |publisher=Scott, Foresman & Co |page=99 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924097564474#page/n111}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cursus.png|thumb|300px|The Roman ''cursus honorum'']]\n\n== Military tribune ==\n{{Main|Military tribune}}\n{{For|the military career track for equestrians|Tres militiae}}\n{{Disputed-section|date=October 2009}}\nThe cursus honorum began with ten years of military duty in the Roman cavalry (the ''[[equites]]'') or in the staff of a general who was a relative or a friend of the family.<ref>{{cite book |last=Collar |first=Anna |title=Religious Networks in the Roman Empire |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=StwaAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA44 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=12 December 2013 |page=44 |isbn=9781107043442}}</ref> The ten years of service were intended to be mandatory in order to qualify for political office,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/cursus-honorum-roman-offices-120107 |title=Hierarchy of Roman Offices in the Cursus Honorum |last=Gill |first=N.S. |date=28 February 2018 |access-date=12 May 2018 |work=[[ThoughtCo.]]}}</ref> but in practice, the rule was not always rigidly applied.\n\nA more prestigious position was that of a [[military tribune]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Belliotti |first=Raymond Angelo |title=Roman Philosophy and the Good Life |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=UqHgtgPvNn4C&pg=PA231 |publisher=[[Lexington Books]] |date=15 August 2009 |page=231 |isbn=9780739139714}}</ref> In the early [[Republic|Roman Republic]], 24 men at the age of around 20 were elected by the [[Tribal Assembly]] to serve as a commander in the legions, with six tribunes to each and command rotating among them. Tribunes could also be appointed by the [[Roman consul|consuls]] or by military commanders in the field as necessary. After the reforms of [[Gaius Marius]] in 107 BC, the six tribunes acted as staff officers for the legionary [[Legatus]] and were appointed tasks and command of units of troops whenever the need arose.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThe following steps of the ''cursus honorum'' were achieved by direct election every year.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== Quaestor ==\n{{Main|Quaestor}}\nThe first official post was that of ''quaestor''. Candidates had to be at least 30 years old. However, men of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] rank could subtract two years from this and other minimum age requirements.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nTwenty quaestors served in the financial administration at Rome or as second-in-command to a governor in the provinces. They could also serve as the paymaster for a legion. A young man who obtained this job was expected to become a very important official. An additional task of all quaestors was the supervision of public games. As a quaestor, an official was allowed to wear the [[toga|toga praetexta]], but was not escorted by [[lictor]]s, nor did he possess [[imperium]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== Aedile ==\n{{Main|Aedile}}\nAt 36 years of age, former quaestors could stand for election to one of the ''aedile'' positions. Of these aediles, two were plebeian and two were patrician, with the patrician aediles called Curule Aediles.  The plebeian aediles were elected by the [[Plebeian Council]] and the curule aediles were either elected by the [[Roman assemblies|Tribal Assembly]] or appointed by the reigning consul. The aediles had administrative responsibilities in Rome. They had to take care of the temples (whence their title, from the Latin ''[[Aedes (Roman)|aedes]]'', \"[[Roman temple|temple]]\"), organize games, and be responsible for the maintenance of the public buildings in Rome. Moreover, they took charge of Rome's water and food supplies; in their capacity as market superintendents, they served sometimes as judges in mercantile affairs.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThe Aedile was the supervisor of public works; the words \"edifice\" and \"edification\" stem from the same root. He oversaw the public works, temples and markets. Therefore, the Aediles would have been in some cooperation with the current Censors, who had similar or related duties. Also they oversaw the organization of festivals and games (''ludi''), which made this a very sought-after office for a career minded politician of the late republic, as it was a good means of gaining popularity by staging spectacles.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nCurule Aediles were added at a later date in the 4th century BC, and their duties do not differ substantially from plebeian aediles.  However, unlike plebeian aediles, curule aediles were allowed certain symbols of rank\u2014the ''[[Curule chair|sella curulis]]'' or 'curule chair,' for example\u2014and only patricians could stand for election to curule aedile. This later changed, and both Plebeians and Patricians could stand for Curule Aedileship.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThe elections for Curule Aedile were at first alternated between Patricians and Plebeians, until late in the 2nd century BC, when the practice was abandoned and both classes became free to run during all years.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nWhile part of the ''cursus honorum'', this step was optional and not required to hold future offices. Though the office was usually held after the [[quaestor]]ship and before the [[praetor]]ship, there are some cases with former praetors serving as aediles.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== Praetor ==\n{{Main|Praetor}}\nAfter holding either the office of quaestor or aedile, a man of 39 years could run for ''praetor''. The number of Praetors elected varied through history, generally increasing with time.  During the republic, six or eight were generally elected each year to serve judicial functions throughout Rome and other governmental responsibilities. In the absence of the Consuls, a Praetor would be given command of the garrison in Rome or in Italy. Also, a Praetor could exercise the functions of the Consuls throughout Rome, but their main function was that of a judge. They would preside over trials involving criminal acts as well as grant court orders or validate \"illegal\" acts as acts of administering justice.  As a Praetor, a magistrate was escorted by six lictors, and wielded [[imperium]]. After a term as Praetor, the magistrate would serve as a provincial governor in the office of Propraetor, wielding Propraetor imperium, commanding the province\u2019s legions, and possessing ultimate authority within his province(s).<ref>{{cite book |first=Jo-Ann |last=Shelton |title=As the Romans did: a sourcebook in Roman Social History |edition=2nd |pages=207-215 |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.es/books/about/As_the_Romans_Did.html?id=zWihGXyCIw8C |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780195089745}}</ref>\n\nOf all the Praetors, two were more prestigious than the others. The first was the Praetor Peregrinus, who was the chief judge in trials involving one or more foreigners. The other was the Praetor Urbanus, the chief judicial office in Rome. He had the power to overturn any verdict by any other courts, and served as judge in cases involving criminal charges against provincial governors. The Praetor Urbanus was not allowed to leave the city for more than ten days. If one of these two Praetors was absent from Rome, the other would perform the duties of both.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== Consul ==\n{{Main|Roman consul}}\nThe office of ''consul'' was the most prestigious of all, and represented the summit of a successful career.

Consuls were responsible for the city's political agenda, commanded large-scale armies and controlled important provinces. The consuls served for only a year (a restriction intended to limit the amassing of power by individuals) and could only rule when they agreed, because each consul could [[veto]] the other's decision.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThe consuls would alternate monthly as the chairman of the Senate. They also were the supreme commanders in the Roman army, with each being granted two legions during their consular year. Consuls also exercised the highest juridical power in the Republic, being the only office with the power to override the decisions of the Praetor Urbanus. Only laws and the decrees of the Senate or the People's assembly limited their powers, and only the veto of a fellow consul or a tribune of the plebs could supersede their decisions.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nA consul was escorted by twelve lictors, held imperium and wore the toga praetexta. Because the consul was the highest executive office within the Republic, they had the power to veto any action or proposal by any other magistrate, save that of the Tribune of the Plebs. After a consulship, a consul was assigned one of the more important provinces and acted as the governor in the same way that a [[Propraetor]] did, only owning Proconsular imperium. A second consulship could only be attempted after an interval of 10 years to prevent one man holding too much power.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== Governor ==\n{{Main|Roman governor}}\nAlthough not part of the Cursus Honorum, upon completing a term as either Praetor or Consul, an officer was required to serve a term as Propraetor and Proconsul, respectively, in one of Rome's many [[Roman province|provinces]]. These Propraetors and Proconsuls held near autocratic authority within their selected province or provinces. Because each governor held equal imperium to the equivalent magistrate, they were escorted by the same number of lictors (12) and could only be vetoed by a reigning Consul or Praetor. Their abilities to govern were only limited by the decrees of the Senate or the [[Roman assemblies|people's assemblies]], and the [[Tribune|Tribune of the Plebs]] was unable to veto their acts as long as the governor remained at least a mile outside of Rome.\n\n== Censor ==\n{{Main|Roman censor}}\nAfter a term as consul, the final step in the Cursus Honorum was the office of ''censor''. This was the only office in the Roman Republic whose term was a period of eighteen months instead of the usual twelve. Censors were elected every five years and although the office held no military imperium, it was considered a great honour. The censors took a regular census of the people and then apportioned the citizens into voting classes on the basis of income and tribal affiliation. The censors enrolled new citizens in tribes and voting classes as well. The censors were also in charge of the membership roll of the Senate, every five years adding new senators who had been elected to the requisite offices. Censors could also remove unworthy members from the Senate. This ability was lost during the dictatorship of Sulla. Censors were also responsible for construction of public buildings and the moral status of the city.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nCensors also had financial duties, in that they had to put out to tender projects that were to be financed by the state. Also, the censors were in charge of the leasing out of conquered land for public use and auction. Though this office owned no imperium, meaning no lictors for protection, they were allowed to wear the ''[[toga praetexta]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== Tribune of the Plebs ==\n{{Main|Tribune of the Plebs}}\nThe office of [[Tribune of the Plebs]] was an important step in the political career of [[plebeians]]. Patricians could not hold the office. The Tribune was an office first created to protect the right of the common man in Roman politics and served as the head of the [[Plebeian Council]]. In the mid-to-late Republic, however, plebeians were often just as, and sometimes more, wealthy and powerful than patricians. Those who held the office were granted [[sacrosanctity]] (the right to be legally protected from any physical harm), the power to rescue any plebeian from the hands of a patrician magistrate, and the right to veto any act or proposal of any magistrate, including another tribune of the people and the consuls. The tribune also had the power to exercise capital punishment against any person who interfered in the performance of his duties. The tribunes could even convene a Senate meeting and lay legislation before it and arrest magistrates. Their houses had to remain open for visitors even during the night, and they were not allowed to be more than a day's journey from Rome. Due to their unique power of sacrosanctity, the Tribune had no need for lictors for protection and owned no imperium, nor could they wear the toga praetexta.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} For a period after Sulla's reforms, a person who had held the office of Tribune of the Plebs could no longer qualify for any other office, and the powers of the tribunes were more limited, but these restrictions were subsequently lifted.\n\n== Princeps senatus ==\n{{Main|Princeps senatus}}\nAnother office not officially a step in the ''cursus honorum'' was the ''princeps senatus'', an extremely prestigious office for a patrician. The ''princeps senatus'' served as the leader of the Senate and was chosen to serve a five-year term by each pair of Censors every five years. Censors could, however, confirm a ''princeps senatus'' for a period of another five years. The ''princeps senatus'' was chosen from all Patricians who had served as a Consul, with former Censors usually holding the office.  The office originally granted the holder the ability to speak first at session on the topic presented by the presiding magistrate, but eventually gained the power to open and close the senate sessions, decide the agenda, decide where the session should take place, impose order and other rules of the session, meet in the name of the senate with embassies of foreign countries, and write in the name of the senate letters and dispatches. This office, like the Tribune, did not own ''imperium'', was not escorted by lictors, and could not wear the ''toga praetexta''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== Dictator and magister equitum ==\n{{Main|Roman dictator|Magister equitum}}\nOf all the offices within the Roman Republic, none granted as much power and authority as the position of ''dictator'', known as the Master of the People. In times of emergency, the Senate would declare that a dictator was required, and the current consuls would appoint a dictator. This was the only decision that could not be vetoed by the Tribune of the Plebs. The dictator was the sole exception to the Roman legal principles of having multiple magistrates in the same office and being legally able to be held to answer for actions in office. Essentially by definition, only one dictator could serve at a time, and no dictator could ever be held legally responsible for any action during his time in office for any reason.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThe dictator was the highest magistrate in degree of imperium and was attended by twenty-four lictors (as were the former Kings of Rome). Although his term lasted only six months instead of twelve (except for the Dictatorships of Sulla and [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]), all other magistrates reported to the dictator (except for the tribunes of the plebs - although they could not veto any of the dictator's acts), granting the dictator absolute authority in both civil and military matters throughout the Republic. The Dictator was free from the control of the Senate in all that he did, could execute anyone without a trial for any reason, and could ignore any law in the performance of his duties. The Dictator was the sole magistrate under the Republic that was truly independent in discharging his duties. All of the other offices were extensions of the Senate's executive authority and thus answerable to the Senate. Since the Dictator exercised his own authority, he did not suffer this limitation, which was the cornerstone of the office's power.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nWhen a Dictator entered office, he appointed to serve as his second-in-command a ''magister equitum'', the Master of the Horse, whose office ceased to exist once the Dictator left office. The magister equitum held Praetorian imperium, was attended by six lictors, and was charged with assisting the Dictator in managing the State. When the Dictator was away from Rome, the magister equitum usually remained behind to administer the city. The magister equitum, like the Dictator, had unchallengeable authority in all civil and military affairs, with his decisions only being overturned by the Dictator himself.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThe Dictatorship was definitively abolished in 44 BC after the assassination of Gaius Julius Caesar ([[Lex Antonia]]).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of topics related to ancient Rome]]\n* [[Political institutions of Rome]]\n* [[Roman Senate]]\n* ''[[Vigintisexviri]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Cursus honorum inscriptions}}\n* [http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/romangvt.html Diagram of the ''cursus honorum'']\n* [http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cursus/cursus_honorum.html Livius.org: Cursus honorum]\n\n{{Ancient Rome topics}}\n{{Italic title}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cursus Honorum}}\n[[Category:Ancient Roman government]]\n[[Category:Roman law]]\n[[Category:Cursus honorum]]", "sha1": "l5q5ogno3nb8hbyxbffenoj1a0nwvy6"}}, {"title": "C.E.", "ns": "0", "id": "6053", "redirect": {"title": "CE"}, "revision": {"id": "769565899", "parentid": "728464121", "timestamp": "2017-03-10T09:55:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "Christian75", "id": "1306352"}, "comment": "/* top */{{redr}} is deprecated - converting to {{Redirect category shell|}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[CE]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|\n{{R from modification}}\n{{R from ambiguous page}}\n}}", "sha1": "dl888owb93d8ut3q42wmvbnkyw544vz"}}, {"title": "C.E", "ns": "0", "id": "6054", "redirect": {"title": "CE"}, "revision": {"id": "769565890", "parentid": "728464139", "timestamp": "2017-03-10T09:55:11Z", "contributor": {"username": "Christian75", "id": "1306352"}, "comment": "/* top */{{redr}} is deprecated - converting to {{Redirect category shell|}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[CE]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|\n{{R from modification}}\n{{R from ambiguous page}}\n}}", "sha1": "dl888owb93d8ut3q42wmvbnkyw544vz"}}, {"title": "CD ROM", "ns": "0", "id": "6055", "redirect": {"title": "CD-ROM"}, "revision": {"id": "783860863", "parentid": "287092868", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:31:14Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[CD-ROM]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from alternative name}}\n}}", "sha1": "72ai6hmr1jrw4ay09uzpcbyz9mmc6qz"}}, {"title": "Continental drift", "ns": "0", "id": "6056", "revision": {"id": "866427705", "parentid": "866400883", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T07:55:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "Dave souza", "id": "85186"}, "comment": "Undid revision 866400883 by [[Special:Contributions/69.172.172.194|69.172.172.194]] ([[User talk:69.172.172.194|talk]]) only a category, and superseded by plate tectonics", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|The movement of the Earth's continents relative to each other}}\n{{About|the development of the continental drift hypothesis before 1958|the contemporary theory|plate tectonics|the Russell Banks novel|Continental Drift (novel)|the fourth film in the Ice Age franchise|Ice Age: Continental Drift}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|The continental drift of the last 250 million years]]\n[[File:Antonio Snider-Pellegrini Opening of the Atlantic.jpg|thumb|300px|Antonio Snider-Pellegrini's Illustration of the closed and opened Atlantic Ocean (1858).<ref>Antonio Snider-Pellegrini, ''La Cr\u00e9ation et ses myst\u00e8res d\u00e9voil\u00e9s'' (Creation and its mysteries revealed) (Paris, France:  Frank et Dentu, 1858), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UZdKmF3iEdUC&pg=PA314-IA3 plates 9 and 10] (between pages 314 and 315).</ref>]]\n\n'''Continental drift''' is the theory that the Earth's [[continent]]s have moved over geologic time relative to each other, thus appearing to have \"drifted\" across the ocean bed.<ref name=usghistory>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/historical.html|title=Historical perspective [This Dynamic Earth, USGS]|website=pubs.usgs.gov}}</ref> The speculation that continents might have 'drifted' was first put forward by [[Abraham Ortelius]] in 1596.

The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented [[glacial striation]]s and deposits called [[tillite]]s, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations that were contiguous with one another.<ref name=wegb />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Geological history of Earth}}\n\n== Works cited ==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|27em}}\n\n;References\n*{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Henry R.|date=2012 |title=The Continental Drift Controversy |volume=Volume I: Wegener and the Early Debate |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge |page= |isbn= |author-link=|ref=Frankel }}\n*{{Citation\n |first= Homer Eugene |last= Le Grand\n |year= 1988\n |title= Drifting Continents and Shifting Theories\n |edition=\n |publisher= Cambridge University\n |isbn= 0-521-31105-5\n}}.\n*{{Citation\n |first= Naomi |last= Oreskes\n |year= 1999\n |title= The Rejection of Continental Drift\n |publisher= Oxford University Press\n |isbn=  0-19-511732-8\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EEQdk9GRfkoC&pg=PA14\n}} (pb: {{ISBNT | 0-19-511733-6 }}).\n*{{Citation\n |first1        = Naomi\n |last1         = Oreskes\n |chapter       = Continental Drift\n |editor1-first = Ted\n |editor1-last  = Munn\n |editor2-first = Michael C.\n |editor2-last  = MacCracken\n |editor3-first = John S.\n |editor3-last  = Perry\n |date          = 2002\n |title         = Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change\n |volume        = Vol. 1\n |pages         = 321\u2013325\n |publisher     = John Wiley & Sons\n |place         = Chichester, West Sussex\n |isbn          = 0-471-97796-9\n |oclc          = 633880622\n |chapter-url   = http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |deadurl       = yes\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204234030/http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |archivedate   = 4 February 2012\n |df            = dmy-all\n}} <!-- CAUTION: catalogs are inconsistent.

The members of the group met as mostly [[freshmen]] at Tuskegee Institute (now [[Tuskegee University]]) in 1968, and signed with [[Motown]] in November 1972, having first caught the public eye opening for [[the Jackson 5]] while on [[concert tour|tour]].\n\nThe group's most successful period was in the late 1970s and early 1980s when [[Lionel Richie]] was the co-lead singer. The band's biggest [[hit record|hit singles]] are [[ballad]]s such as \"[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]\", \"[[Three Times a Lady]]\", and \"[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]\"; and [[funk]]y dance hits which include \"[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]\", \"Fancy Dancer\", \"[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]\", and \"[[Too Hot ta Trot]]\". In 1986 the Commodores won their first Grammy for the song \"Nightshift\".\n\n==Band history==\nThe Commodores originally came together from two former student groups, the Mystics and the Jays. Richie described some members of the Mystics as \"jazz buffs\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19800925&id=ukUjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qKQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1845,1760997&hl=en|title=The Montreal Gazette - Google News Archive Search|website=News.google.com|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}</ref>\nTogether, a six-man band was created from which the notable individuals were [[Lionel Richie]], [[Thomas McClary (musician)|Thomas McClary]], and William King from the Mystics; Andre Callahan, Michael Gilbert, and Milan Williams were from the Jays. They wanted to change the name. To choose a new name, William \"WAK\" King opened a dictionary and randomly picked a word. \"We lucked out,\" he remarked with a laugh when telling this story to ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine. \"We almost became 'The Commodes!'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RG_LAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&lpg=PT92&dq=The+Commodores+The+Commodes&source=bl&ots=W4g0OxPPMd&sig=Bi_sjONUyFWyNv5p1XZawj2_U3g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBGoVChMI88nkzoihxwIVpximCh1ZdwLa#v=onepage&q=The+Commodores+The+Commodes&f=false|title=Motown Encyclopedia|first=Graham|last=Betts|date=June 2, 2014|publisher=AC Publishing|accessdate=October 31, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThe band originated while its members attended [[Tuskegee University]] in Alabama. After winning the university's annual freshman talent contest, they played at fraternity parties as well as a weekend gig at the Black Forest Inn, one of a few clubs in Tuskegee that catered to college students. They performed mostly cover tunes and some original songs with their first singer, James Ingram (not the [[James Ingram|famous solo artist]]). Ingram, older than the rest of the band, left to serve active duty in [[Vietnam]], and was later replaced by Walter \"Clyde\" Orange, who wrote, or co-wrote, many of their hit tunes. [[Lionel Richie]] and Orange alternated as lead singers. (Orange was the lead singer on the Top 10 hits \"Brick House\" and \"[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]\".)\n\nThe early band was managed by Benny Ashburn, who brought them to his family's vacation lodge on Martha's Vineyard in 1971 and 1972. There, Ashburn test marketed the group by having them play at outdoor spaces such as parking lots and summer festivals. \n\nThe Commodores made a brief appearance in the 1978 film ''[[Thank God It's Friday (film)|Thank God It's Friday]]''. They performed the song \"Too Hot ta Trot\" during the dance contest; the songs \"Brick House\" and \"Easy\" were also played during the movie.\n\n\"[[Machine Gun (Commodores album)|Machine Gun]]\", the instrumental title track from the band's debut album, became a staple at American sporting events,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and is similarly featured in many films, including ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076327/soundtrack|title=Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977)|accessdate=October 31, 2017|website=IMDb.com}}</ref> It reached No. 22 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 1975. Another instrumental, \"[[Cebu]]\" (named after an [[Cebu Province|island]] in the [[Philippines]]), later became a staple{{by whom|date=November 2012}} in the [[Quiet storm]] format. Three albums released in 1975 and 1976 (''[[Caught in the Act (Commodores album)|Caught in the Act]]'', ''[[Movin' On (Commodores album)|Movin' On]]'', and ''[[Hot On the Tracks]]'') are considered{{By whom|date=October 2014}} the peak of their harder funk period. After those recordings the group started to move towards a softer sound. That move was hinted at in their 1976 Top Ten hits \"Sweet Love\" and \"[[Just to Be Close to You]]\". In 1977 the Commodores released \"[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]\", which became the group's biggest hit yet, reaching No. 4 in the U.S., followed by \"Brick House\", also top 5, both from their album ''The Commodores'', as was \"Zoom\". The group reached No. 1 in 1978 with \"[[Three Times a Lady]]\". In 1979 the Commodores scored another top-five ballad, \"Sail On\", before reaching the top of the charts once again with another ballad, \"[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]\". In 1981 they released two top-ten hits with \"Oh No\" (No. 4) and their first upbeat single in almost five years, \"[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]\" (No. 8).\n\nIn 1982, Lionel Richie left to pursue a solo career. Skyler Jett replaced Richie as co-lead singer. Also in 1982, their manager Benjamin Ashburn who also managed another band [[Platinum Hook]] died of a heart attack aged 54.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2211&dat=19820911&id=5yEmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KP4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1698,1005172&hl=en|title=The Afro American - Google News Archive Search|website=News.google.com|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:CommodoresPerforming.jpg|thumb|right|Band performance in Florida during the 1990s]]\nOver time, several founding members left - McClary left in 1983 (shortly after Richie) to pursue a solo career and to develop a [[gospel music]] company. McClary was replaced by guitarist-vocalist [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]], while LaPread left in 1986 and moved to [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. Reynolds departed for [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] in 1987, which prompted trumpeter William \"WAK\" King to take over primary guitar duties for live performances. Keyboardist Milan Williams exited the band in 1989 after allegedly refusing to tour [[South Africa]].\n\nThe group also gradually abandoned its funk roots and moved into the more commercial pop arena. In 1984 former [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]] singer James Dean \"J.D.\" Nicholas assumed co-lead vocal duties with drummer Walter Orange. The band remained hitless until 1985 when their final [[Motown]] album, ''Nightshift'', produced by Dennis Lambert\u2014all prior albums were produced by James Anthony Carmichael\u2014delivered the Grammy Award-winning title track \"[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]\" (No. 3 in the U.S.), a loving tribute to [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Jackie Wilson]] who had both died the previous year.

Initially the band thought it was a hoax. However, back in their dressing rooms they received confirmation and broke down in tears. The next night at [[Birmingham]]'s [[Barclaycard Arena|NIA Arena]], J.D. Nicholas added Jackson's name into the lyrics of the song, and thenceforth the Commodores have mentioned Jackson and other deceased R&B singers. Thus came the inspiration upon the one-year anniversary of Jackson's death, to re-record, with new lyrics, the hit song \"Nightshift\" as a tribute. \"Nightshift\" won the Commodores their first [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals]] in 1985.\n\nIn 1990 the Commodores formed Commodores Records and re-recorded their 20 greatest hits as ''Commodores Hits Vol. I & II''. They have [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] a live album ''[[Commodores Live!]]'' along with a DVD of the same name, and a Christmas album titled ''Commodores Christmas''. In 2012, the band was working on new material, some contributions written by current and former members.\n\nThe Commodores now consist of Walter \"Clyde\" Orange, James Dean \"J.D.\" Nicholas, and William \"WAK\" King, along with their five-piece band, known as the \"Mean Machine\".

Over 90% of the collagen in the [[human body]], however, is type I.<ref>Sabiston textbook of surgery board review, 7th edition. Chapter 5 wound healing, question 14</ref>\n\nSo far, 28 types of collagen have been identified and described. They can be divided into several groups according to the structure they form:\n\n*Fibrillar (Type I, II, III, V, XI)\n*Non-fibrillar\n**[[FACIT collagen|FACIT]] (Fibril Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple Helices) (Type IX, XII, XIV, XIX, XXI)\n**Short chain (Type VIII, X)\n**[[Basement membrane]] (Type IV)\n**[[Multiplexin]] (Multiple Triple Helix domains with Interruptions) (Type XV, XVIII)\n**MACIT (Membrane Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple Helices) (Type XIII, XVII)\n**Other (Type VI, VII)\n\nThe five most common types are:\n\n*[[Type I collagen|Type I]]: [[skin]], [[tendon]], vasculature, organs, [[bone]] (main component of the organic part of bone)\n*[[Type II collagen|Type II]]: [[cartilage]] (main collagenous component of cartilage)\n*[[Collagen, type III, alpha 1|Type III]]: reticulate (main component of [[reticular fiber]]s), commonly found alongside type I.\n*[[Type IV collagen|Type IV]]: forms basal lamina, the epithelium-secreted layer of the [[basement membrane]].\n*[[Type-V collagen|Type V]]: cell surfaces, [[hair]], and [[placenta]]\n\n==Medical uses==\n\n===Cardiac applications===\nThe collagenous [[cardiac skeleton]] which includes the four [[heart valve]] rings, is histologically, elastically and uniquely bound to cardiac muscle. The cardiac skeleton also includes the separating septa of the heart chambers \u2013 the [[interventricular septum]] and the [[atrioventricular septum]]. Collagen contribution to the measure of [[Cardiac stress test|cardiac performance]] summarily represents a continuous torsional force opposed to the [[fluid mechanics]] of [[blood]] pressure emitted from the heart. The collagenous structure that divides the upper chambers of the heart from the lower chambers is an impermeable membrane that excludes both blood and electrical impulses through typical physiological means. With support from collagen, [[atrial fibrillation]] should never deteriorate to [[ventricular fibrillation]]. Collagen is layered in variable densities with cardiac muscle mass. The mass, distribution, age and density of collagen all contribute to the [[compliance (physiology)|compliance]] required to move blood back and forth. Individual cardiac valvular leaflets are folded into shape by specialized collagen under variable [[pressure]]. Gradual [[calcium]] deposition within collagen occurs as a natural function of aging. Calcified points within collagen matrices show contrast in a moving display of blood and muscle, enabling methods of [[cardiac imaging]] technology to arrive at ratios essentially stating blood in ([[cardiac input]]) and blood out ([[cardiac output]]). Pathology of the collagen underpinning of the heart is understood within the category of [[connective tissue disease]].\n\n===Cosmetic surgery===\nCollagen has been widely used in cosmetic surgery, as a healing aid for burn patients for reconstruction of bone and a wide variety of dental, orthopedic, and surgical purposes. Both human and bovine collagen is widely used as dermal fillers for treatment of wrinkles and skin aging.<ref name=\"pharmax2\">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/03/the-ageing-skin-part-4e-dermal-fillers/ Dermal Fillers | The Ageing Skin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513225727/http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/03/the-ageing-skin-part-4e-dermal-fillers/ |date=2011-05-13 }}.

Most manufacturers use donor animals from either \"closed herds\", or from countries which have never had a reported case of BSE such as Australia, Brazil, and New Zealand.\n\n===Bone grafts===\nAs the skeleton forms the structure of the body, it is vital that it maintains its strength, even after breaks and injuries. Collagen is used in bone grafting as it has a triple helical structure, making it a very strong molecule. It is ideal for use in bones, as it does not compromise the structural integrity of the skeleton. The triple helical structure of collagen prevents it from being broken down by enzymes, it enables adhesiveness of cells and it is important for the proper assembly of the extracellular matrix.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cunniffe|first=G|author2=F O'Brien|title=Collagen scaffolds for orthopedic regenerative medicine|journal=The Journal of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society|year=2011|volume=63|issue=4|pages=66\u201373|doi=10.1007/s11837-011-0061-y|bibcode = 2011JOM....63d..66C }}</ref>\n\n===Tissue regeneration===\nCollagen scaffolds are used in tissue regeneration, whether in sponges, thin sheets, or gels. Collagen has the correct properties for tissue regeneration such as pore structure, permeability, hydrophilicity, and being stable in vivo.

It is resistant against bacteria, which is of vital importance in a wound dressing. It helps to keep the wound sterile, because of its natural ability to fight infection.

The formation of collagen which results in fibrillary collagen (most common form) is discussed here. Meshwork collagen, which is often involved in the formation of filtration systems, is the other form of collagen. All types of collagens are triple helices, and the differences lie in the make-up of the alpha peptides created in step 2.\n# '''Transcription of mRNA''': About 34 genes are associated with collagen formation, each coding for a specific mRNA sequence, and typically have the \"''COL''\" prefix. The beginning of collagen synthesis begins with turning on genes which are associated with the formation of a particular alpha peptide (typically alpha 1, 2 or 3).\n# '''Pre-pro-peptide formation''': Once the final mRNA exits from the cell nucleus and enters into the cytoplasm, it links with the ribosomal subunits and the process of translation occurs. The early/first part of the new peptide is known as the signal sequence. The signal sequence on the [[N-terminal]] of the peptide is recognized by a [[signal recognition particle]] on the endoplasmic reticulum, which will be responsible for directing the pre-pro-peptide into the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, once the synthesis of new peptide is finished, it goes directly into the endoplasmic reticulum for post-translational processing. It is now known as pre-pro-collagen.\n# '''Pre-pro-peptide to pro-collagen''': Three modifications of the pre-pro-peptide occur leading to the formation of the alpha peptide:\n## The signal peptide on the N-terminal is dissolved, and the molecule is now known as ''propeptide'' (not procollagen).\n## Hydroxylation of lysines and prolines on propeptide by the enzymes 'prolyl hydroxylase' and 'lysyl hydroxylase' (to produce hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine) occurs to aid cross-linking of the alpha peptides. This enzymatic step requires [[vitamin C]] as a cofactor. In [[scurvy]], the lack of hydroxylation of prolines and lysines causes a looser triple helix (which is formed by three alpha peptides). \n## Glycosylation occurs by adding either glucose or galactose monomers onto the hydroxyl groups that were placed onto lysines, but not on prolines. \n## Once these modifications have taken place, three of the hydroxylated and glycosylated propeptides twist into a triple helix forming procollagen. Procollagen still has unwound ends, which will be later trimmed. At this point, the procollagen is packaged into a transfer vesicle destined for the Golgi apparatus. \n# '''Golgi apparatus modification''': In the Golgi apparatus, the procollagen goes through one last post-translational modification before being secreted out of the cell. In this step, oligosaccharides (not monosaccharides as in step 3) are added, and then the procollagen is packaged into a secretory vesicle destined for the extracellular space.\n# '''Formation of tropocollagen''': Once outside the cell, membrane bound enzymes known as 'collagen peptidases', remove the \"loose ends\" of the procollagen molecule. What is left is known as tropocollagen. Defects in this step produce one of the many collagenopathies known as [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]]. This step is absent when synthesizing type III, a type of fibrilar collagen.\n# '''Formation of the collagen fibril''': [[lysyl oxidase]], an extracellular [[Copper in health|copper-dependent]] enzyme, produces the final step in the collagen synthesis pathway. This enzyme acts on lysines and hydroxylysines producing aldehyde groups, which will eventually undergo covalent bonding between tropocollagen molecules. This polymer of tropocollogen is known as a collagen fibril.\n\n[[File:Tropocollagen cross-linkage lysyl oxidase (EN).svg|thumb|Action of [[lysyl oxidase]]]]\n\n===Amino acids===\nCollagen has an unusual [[amino acid]] composition and sequence:\n* [[Glycine]] is found at almost every third [[residue (biochemistry)|residue]].\n* [[Proline]] makes up about 17% of collagen.\n* Collagen contains two uncommon derivative amino acids not directly inserted during [[translation (genetics)|translation]].

These peptide chains (known as [[preprocollagen]]) have [[registration peptide]]s on each end and a [[signal peptide]].\n##Polypeptide chains are released into the lumen of the RER.\n##Signal peptides are cleaved inside the RER and the chains are now known as pro-alpha chains.\n##[[Hydroxylation]] of [[lysine]] and [[proline]] amino acids occurs inside the lumen. This process is dependent on [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C) as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].\n##[[Glycosylation]] of specific hydroxylysine residues occurs.\n##Triple alpha helical structure is formed inside the endoplasmic reticulum from two alpha-1 chains and one alpha-2 chain.\n##[[Procollagen]] is shipped to the [[Golgi apparatus]], where it is packaged and secreted by [[exocytosis]].\n#Outside the cell\n##Registration peptides are cleaved and tropocollagen is formed by [[procollagen peptidase]].\n##Multiple tropocollagen molecules form collagen fibrils, via covalent cross-linking ([[aldol reaction]]) by [[lysyl oxidase]] which links hydroxylysine and lysine residues. Multiple collagen fibrils form into collagen fibers.\n##Collagen may be attached to cell membranes via several types of protein, including [[fibronectin]], [[laminin]], [[fibulin]] and [[integrin]].\n\n===Synthetic pathogenesis===\nVitamin C deficiency causes [[scurvy]], a serious and painful disease in which defective collagen prevents the formation of strong [[connective tissue]]. [[Gingiva|Gums]] deteriorate and bleed, with loss of teeth; skin discolors, and [[wound]]s do not heal. Prior to the 18th century, this condition was notorious among long-duration military, particularly naval, expeditions during which participants were deprived of foods containing vitamin C.\n\nAn [[autoimmune disease]] such as [[lupus erythematosus]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Al-Hadithy |first=H. |year=1982 |first2=DA |last3=Addison |first3=IE |last4=Goldstone |first4=AH |last5=Snaith |first5=ML |title=Neutrophil function in systemic lupus erythematosus and other collagen diseases |journal=Ann Rheum Dis |volume=41 |pmid=7065727 |issue=1 |pmc=1000860 |pages=33\u201338 |doi=10.1136/ard.41.1.33 |displayauthors=2 |last2=Isenberg }}</ref> may attack healthy collagen fibers.\n\nMany bacteria and viruses secrete [[virulence factor]]s, such as the enzyme [[collagenase]], which destroys collagen or interferes with its production.\n\n==Molecular structure==\nA single collagen molecule, tropocollagen, is used to make up larger collagen aggregates, such as fibrils. It is approximately 300&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] long and 1.5&nbsp;nm in diameter, and it is made up of three [[polypeptide]] strands (called alpha peptides, see step 2), each of which has the conformation of a left-handed [[helix]] \u2013 this should not be confused with the right-handed [[alpha helix]]. These three left-handed helices are twisted together into a right-handed triple helix or \"super helix\", a cooperative [[quaternary structure]] stabilized by many [[hydrogen bond]]s. With type I collagen and possibly all fibrillar collagens, if not all collagens, each triple-helix associates into a right-handed super-super-coil referred to as the collagen microfibril. Each microfibril is [[wikt:interdigitate|interdigitated]] with its neighboring microfibrils to a degree that might suggest they are individually unstable, although within collagen fibrils, they are so well ordered as to be crystalline.\n\n[[File:Collagen biosynthesis (en).png|thumb|Three [[polypeptide]]s coil to form tropocollagen. Many tropocollagens then bind together to form a fibril, and many of these then form a fibre.]]\n\nA distinctive feature of collagen is the regular arrangement of [[amino acid]]s in each of the three chains of these collagen subunits. The sequence often follows the pattern [[glycine|Gly]]-[[proline|Pro]]-X or Gly-X-[[hydroxyproline|Hyp]], where X may be any of various other amino acid residues.<ref name=\"SzpakJAS\"/> Proline or hydroxyproline constitute about 1/6 of the total sequence. With glycine accounting for the 1/3 of the sequence, this means approximately half of the collagen sequence is not glycine, proline or hydroxyproline, a fact often missed due to the distraction of the unusual GX<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub> character of collagen alpha-peptides. The high glycine content of collagen is important with respect to stabilization of the collagen helix as this allows the very close association of the collagen fibers within the molecule, facilitating hydrogen bonding and the formation of intermolecular cross-links.<ref name=\"SzpakJAS\"/> This kind of regular repetition and high glycine content is found in only a few other fibrous proteins, such as [[silk]] [[fibroin]].\n\nCollagen is not only a structural protein. Due to its key role in the determination of cell phenotype, cell adhesion, tissue regulation, and infrastructure, many sections of its non-proline-rich regions have cell or matrix association/regulation roles. The relatively high content of proline and hydroxyproline rings, with their geometrically constrained [[carboxyl]] and (secondary) [[amino]] groups, along with the rich abundance of glycine, accounts for the tendency of the individual polypeptide strands to form left-handed helices spontaneously, without any intrachain hydrogen bonding.\n\nBecause glycine is the smallest amino acid with no side chain, it plays a unique role in fibrous structural proteins. In collagen, Gly is required at every third position because the assembly of the triple helix puts this residue at the interior (axis) of the helix, where there is no space for a larger side group than glycine\u2019s single [[hydrogen|hydrogen atom]]. For the same reason, the rings of the Pro and Hyp must point outward.

Watterson was warned by the syndicate not to give up the day job yet, but it wasn't long before the series had become a hit. Within a year of [[print syndication|syndication]], the strip was published in roughly 250 newspapers and was proving to have international appeal with translation and [[Calvin and Hobbes in translation|wide circulation]] outside the United States.\n\nAlthough ''Calvin'' would undergo continual artistic development and creative innovation over the period of syndication, the earliest strips demonstrate a remarkable consistency with the latest. Watterson introduced all the major characters within the first three weeks, and made no changes to the central cast over the next 10 years.\n\nBy April 5, 1987, Watterson was featured in an article in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name=\"simple\" /> ''Calvin and Hobbes'' earned Watterson the Reuben Award from the [[National Cartoonists Society]] in the Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year category, first in 1986 and again in 1988.

By 1991 Watterson had achieved his goal of securing a new contract that granted him legal control over his creation and all future licencing arrangements.\n\n=== Creative control (1991 - 1995) ===\nHaving achieved his objective of creative control, Watterson's desire for privacy subsequently reasserted itself and he ceased all media interviews, relocated to [[New Mexico]], and largely disappeared from public engagements, refusing to attend the ceremonies of any of the cartooning awards he won.<ref name=\":1\" /> The pressures of the battle over merchandising led to Watterson taking an extended break from May 5, 1991, to February 1, 1992, unprecedented in the world of syndicated cartoonists.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| header = Comparison of Calvin and Hobbes' following layout changes\n| direction = \n| width = 260\n| image1 = Calvin and Hobbes 6 Sep 1987.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Calvin_and_Hobbes_26_Sep_1993.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The comic strip on the left from 1987 illustrates the layout constraints that Bill Watterson was forced to work within for the first 6 years of his Calvin and Hobbes comic strip.

Few editors approved of the move, but the strip was so popular that they had no choice but to continue to run it for fear that competing newspapers might pick it up and draw its fans away.<ref name=\"astor1991\">{{cite journal |last=Astor |first=David |title=Nine-month Vacation for Bill Watterson |page=34 |journal=[[Editor & Publisher]] |publisher=Duncan McIntosh |location=Irvine, California |date=1991-03-30}}</ref> Watterson returned to the strip in 1992 with plans to produce his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] page. This made him only the second cartoonist since [[Garry Trudeau]] to have sufficient popularity to demand more space and control over the presentation of their work.\n\nWatterson took a second sabbatical from April 3 through December 31, 1994. When he returned, he had made the decision to end the strip. In 1995, Watterson sent a letter via his syndicate to all editors whose newspapers carried his strip announcing his plans to end the strip by the end of the year.

This larger format version of the strip was constrained by mandatory layout requirements that made it possible for newspaper editors to format the strip for different page sizes and layouts. \n\nWatterson grew increasingly frustrated by the shrinking of the available space for comics in the newspapers and the mandatory panel divisions that restricted his ability to produce better artwork and more creative story telling. He lamented that without space for anything more than simple dialogue or sparse artwork, comics as an art form were becoming dilute, bland, and unoriginal.<ref name=\"west1989\">{{cite web|url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ccomicsjournal.html|title=Interview: Bill Watterson|last=West|first=Richard Samuel|date=February 1989|work=[[The Comics Journal]] / [[Fantagraphics]] via Calvin and Hobbies: Magic on Paper (fan site)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714012735/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ccomicsjournal.html|archivedate=July 14, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=August 30, 2012|issue=127|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"astor1988\">{{cite journal |title=Watterson Knocks the Shrinking of Comics |first=David |last=Astor |journal=[[Editor & Publisher]] |publisher=Duncan McIntosh |location=Irvine, California |date=1988-12-03 |page=40}}</ref> \n\nWatterson longed for the artistic freedom allotted to classic strips such as ''[[Little Nemo]]'' and ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', and in 1989 he gave a sample of what could be accomplished with such liberty in the opening pages of the Sunday strip compilation, ''The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book\u2014''a 8-page previously unpublished Calvin story fully illustrated in watercolour. The same book contained an afterword from the artist himself, reflecting on a time when comic strips were allocated a whole page of the newspaper and every comic was like a \"colour poster\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book|last=Watterson|first=Bill|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=1989|isbn=0836218523|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWithin two years Watterson was ultimately successful in negotiating a deal that provided him more space and creative freedom. Following his 1991 sabbatical, Universal Press announced that Watterson had decided to sell his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] page. Many editors and even a few cartoonists including [[Bil Keane|Bill Keane]] ([[The Family Circus]]) and [[Bruce Beattie]] ([[Snafu Comics|Sanfu]]) criticized him for what they perceived as arrogance and an unwillingness to abide by the normal practices of the cartoon business.<ref name=\"astor1992\">{{cite journal|last=Astor|first=David|date=1992-03-07|title=Cartoonists discuss 'Calvin' requirement|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/article_brief/eandp/1/1165165|deadurl=yes|journal=[[Editor & Publisher]]|location=Irvine, California|publisher=Duncan McIntosh|page=34|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320192434/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/article_brief/eandp/1/1165165|archivedate=2007-03-20|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> Others, including [[Bill Amend]] ([[FoxTrot|Foxtrot]]), Johnny Hart ([[B.C.

The first took place from May 5, 1991, to February 1, 1992, and second from April 3 through December 31, 1994. These sabbaticals were included in the new contract Watterson managed to negotiate with Universal Features in 1990. The sabbaticals were proposed by the syndicate themselves who, fearing Watterson's complete burnout, endeavoured to get another five years of work from their star artist.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWatterson remains only the third cartoonist with sufficient popularity and stature to receive a sabbatical from their syndicate, the first being [[Garry Trudeau]] ([[Doonesbury]]) in 1983 and [[Gary Larson]] ([[The Far Side]]) in 1989.<ref name=\":3\" /> Typically cartoonists are expected to produce sufficient strips to cover any period of time they may wish to take off. Watterson's lengthy sabbaticals received some mild criticism from his fellow cartoonists including [[Greg Evans (cartoonist)|Greg Evans]] ([[Luann (comic strip)|Luann]]), and even [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schulz]] ([[Peanuts]]), one of Watterson's major artistic influences, called it a \"puzzle\". Some cartoonists resented the idea that Watterson worked harder than others, whilst others supported it. At least one newspaper editor noted that the strip was the most popular in the country, and that he had \"earned it\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://timhulsizer.com/cwords/cmixedresponse.html|title=Mixed Response To Second Sabbatical|last=|first=|date=26 March 1994|work=Editor & Publisher|access-date=19 September 2018|archive-url=http://timhulsizer.com/cwords/cmixedresponse.html|issue=13|volume=127|page=30}}</ref> Following his second sabbatical, Watterson made the decision that he was going to retire from the comic strip entirely.\n\n==Merchandising==\nIn spite of ''Calvin and Hobbes''' popularity, the strip remains notable for the lack of official product merchandising. Bill Watterson held that comic strips should stand on their own as an art form and although he did not start out completely opposed to merchandising in all forms (or even for all comic strips), he did reject an early syndication deal that involved incorporating a more marketable, licensed character into his strip.<ref name=\"christie1987\" /> In spite of being an unproven cartoonist, and having been flown all the way to New York to discuss the proposal, Watterson reflexively resented the idea of \"cartooning by committee\" and turned it down.\n\nLater, when ''Calvin'' was accepted by Universal Syndicate, and began to grow in popularity Watterson found himself at odds with the syndicate, which urged him to begin merchandising the characters and touring the country to promote the first collections of comic strips. Watterson refused. To him, the integrity of the strip and its artist would be undermined by [[commercialization]], which he saw as a major negative influence in the world of cartoon art<ref name=\"west1989\" /> and he came to believe that licensing his character would only violate the spirit of his work.{{fact|date=October 2018}} He gave an example of this in discussing his opposition to a Hobbes plush toy: that if the essence of Hobbes' nature in the strip is that it remain unresolved whether he is a real tiger or a stuffed toy, then creating a real stuffed toy would only destroy the magic. However, having initially signed away control over merchandising in his initial contract with the syndicate<ref name=\":1\" />, Watterson would commence a lengthy and emotionally draining battle with Universal to gain control over his work. Ultimately Universal did not approve any products against Watterson's wishes, understanding that unlike other comic strips, it would be near impossible to separate the creator from the strip if Watterson chose to walk away. \n\nOne estimate places the value of licensing revenue forgone by Watterson at $300 - $400 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bigthink.com/Picture-This/what-is-the-legacy-of-calvin-and-hobbes|title=What is the legacy of Calvin and Hobbes?|last=Bob|first=Duggan|date=|work=Big Think|access-date=}}</ref> Almost no legitimate ''Calvin and Hobbes'' merchandise exists.<ref name=\"items\">{{cite web | url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/citems.html | title=A Concise Guide to All Legal Calvin and Hobbes Items | last=Hulsizer | first=Tim | publisher=Calvin and Hobbes: Magic on Paper (fan site)| accessdate=December 24, 2011|archivedate=July 19, 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719004818/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/citems.html | deadurl=no}}</ref> Exceptions produced during the strip's original run include two 16-month calendars (1988\u20131989 and 1989\u20131990), a t-shirt for the Smithsonian Exhibit, ''Great American Comics: 100 Years of Cartoon Art'' (1990) and the textbook [[Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes|''Teaching with'' Calvin and Hobbes]],<ref name=\"twch\">{{cite book |last1=Holmen |first1=Linda |last2=Santella-Johnson |first2=Mary |last3=Watterson |first3=Bill |authorlink3=Bill Watterson |others=Cover and supplementary art by Jan Roebken |title=Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes |year=1993 |publisher=Playground Publishing |location=Fargo, North Dakota |isbn=1-878849-15-8 |laysummary=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cteaching.html |laydate=2004}}</ref> which has been described as \"perhaps the most difficult piece of official ''Calvin and Hobbes'' memorabilia to find.\"<ref name=\"Martell 2010 p. 236\">{{harvp|Martell|2010|p=236}}</ref> In 2010 Watterson did allow his characters to be included in a series of [[United States Postal Service]] stamps honoring five classic American comics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2010/pr10_068.htm |title=Sunday Funnies Comic Strips Debut on Stamps |date=July 16, 2010 |publisher=[[United States Postal Service]] [[press release]] |location=Columbus, Ohio |accessdate=January 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027144142/http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2010/pr10_068.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> Licensed prints of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' can also be purchased through [[Uclick]], the digital division of [[Andrews McMeel Universal]], and have also been included in various academic works.\n\nThe strip's immense popularity has led to the appearance of various [[counterfeit]] items such as window decals and T-shirts that often feature [[Off-color humor|crude humor]], [[binge drinking]] and other themes that are not found in Watterson's work.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 12.</ref> Images from one strip in which Calvin and Hobbes dance to loud music at night were commonly used for copyright violations.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 36.</ref> After threat of a lawsuit alleging infringement of copyright and trademark, some sticker makers replaced Calvin with a different boy, while other makers made no changes.<ref>{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Bernstein |title=Calvin's Unauthorized Leak: Stock Car Fans Misuse Comics Character |work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]] ([[Norfolk, Virginia]]) via ''[[The Washington Post]]'' via Calvin and Hobbes: Magic on Paper (fan site) |page=B9 |date=July 17, 1997 |url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cstockcars.html |accessdate=April 18, 2011 |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722001516/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cstockcars.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Watterson wryly commented, \"I clearly miscalculated how popular it would be to show Calvin urinating on a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] logo,\"<ref name=\"amiv\" /> but that they would be his \"ticket to immortality\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/53216/mental-floss-exclusive-our-interview-bill-watterson|title=Our Interview with Calvin and Hobbes Creator Bill Watterson!|last=Rossen|first=Jake|date=17 October 2013|work=Mental Floss|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\nWatterson has expressed admiration for animation as an artform. In a 1989 interview in ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' he described the appeal of being able to do things with a moving image that can't be done by a simple drawing: the distortion, the exaggeration and the control over the length of time an event is viewed.{{fact|date=October 2018}} However, although the visual possibilities of animation appealed, the idea of finding a voice for Calvin made him uncomfortable, as did the idea of working with a team of animators.<ref name=\"west1989\" />. Ultimately, ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was never made into an [[animated cartoon|animated series]]. Watterson later stated in ''The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'' that he liked the fact that his strip was a \"low-tech, one-man operation,\" and that he took great pride in the fact that he drew every line and wrote every word on his own.<ref>[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 11.</ref> Calls from major Hollywood figures interested in an adaptation of his work, including [[Jim Henson]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] were never returned<ref name=\":1\" /> and in a 2013 interview Watterson stated that he had \"zero interest\" in an animated adaptation as there was really no upside for him in doing so.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Style and influences==\nThe strip borrows several elements and themes from three major influences: [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]'', [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', and [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]''.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 21\">{{harvp|Watterson|1995|p=21}}</ref> Schulz and Kelly particularly influenced Watterson's outlook on comics during his formative years.<ref name=\"christie1987\" />\n\nNotable elements of Watterson's artistic style are his characters' diverse and often exaggerated expressions (particularly those of Calvin), elaborate and bizarre backgrounds for Calvin's flights of imagination, expressions of motion, and frequent visual jokes and metaphors. In the later years of the strip, with more panel space available for his use, Watterson experimented more freely with different panel layouts, art styles, stories without dialogue, and greater use of [[White space (visual arts)|whitespace]]. He also makes a point of not showing certain things explicitly: the \"Noodle Incident\" and the [[Children's literature|children's book]] ''Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie'' are left to the reader's imagination, where Watterson was sure they would be \"more outrageous\" than he could portray.<ref>{{harvp|Watterson|1995|p=200}}</ref>\n\n== Production and technique ==\nWatterson's technique started with minimalist [[Sketch (drawing)|pencil sketches]] drawn with a [[light pencil]] (though the larger Sunday strips often required more elaborate work) on a piece of [[Bristol board]], with his brand of choice being Strathmore because he felt it held the drawings better on the page as opposed to the cheaper brands (Watterson said he would use any cheap pad of Bristol board his local supply store had, but switched to Strathmore after he found himself growing more and more displeased with the results). He would then use a small [[Kolinsky sable-hair brush|sable]] brush and [[India ink]] to fill in the rest of the drawing, saying that he did not want to simply trace over his penciling and thus make the inking more spontaneous. He lettered dialogue with a [[Rotring|Rapidograph]] [[fountain pen]], and he used a [[quill|crowquill]] pen for odds and ends.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 20\">[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 20.</ref> Mistakes were covered with various forms of [[correction fluid]], including the type used on typewriters. Watterson was careful in his use of color, often spending a great deal of time in choosing the right colors to employ for the weekly Sunday strip; his technique was to cut the color tabs the syndicate sent him into individual squares, lay out the colors, and then paint a watercolor approximation of the strip on tracing paper over the Bristol board and then mark the strip accordingly before sending it on.<ref name=\"Watterson 2001\">[[#CITEREFWatterson2001|Watterson (2001)]].</ref> When ''Calvin and Hobbes'' began there were 64 colors available for the Sunday strips. For the later Sunday strips Watterson had 125 colors as well as the ability to fade the colors into each other.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 20\"/>\n\n==Main characters==\n===Calvin===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Calvin\n| series           = <!-- use without the italic on the outside -->\n| image            = Calvin,_of_Calvin_and_Hobbes.png\n| image_size       =140px \n| alt              = \n| caption          = \n| first            = November 18, 1985\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Bill Watterson]]\n| lbl1             = Comic\n| data1            = ''Calvin and Hobbes''\n| lbl21            = Age\n| data21           = 6}}\n\nCalvin, named after the 16th-century theologian [[John Calvin]], is a six-year-old boy with blond, spiky hair and a distinctive red-and-black striped shirt, black pants, and sneakers.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 21\" /> Despite his poor grades in school, Calvin demonstrates his intelligence through a sophisticated vocabulary and philosophical mind. Watterson described Calvin has having \"not much of a filter between his brain and his mouth\", a \"little too intelligent for his age\", lacking in restraint and not yet having the experience to \"know the things that you shouldn't do.\"<ref name=\"williams1987\">{{cite book|title=Watterson: Calvin's other alter ego|last=Williams|first=Gene|work=[[Cleveland Plain Dealer]]|year=1987}}</ref> The comic strip largely revolves around the Calvin's inner world, and his largely negative experiences interacting with those outside of it (fellow students, authority figures and his parents).\n\n===Hobbes===\n{{Main|Hobbes (Calvin and Hobbes)}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Hobbes\n| image            = Hobbes_comic_strip_character.jpg\n| image_size       =140px \n| alt              = \n| caption          = \n| first            = November 18, 1985\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Bill Watterson]]\n| lbl1             = Comic strip\n| data1            = ''Calvin and Hobbes''\n| species          = Tiger\n}}\n\nFrom Calvin's point of view, Hobbes is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] tiger, much larger than Calvin and full of independent attitudes and ideas. When the perspective shifts to any other character, readers see merely a stuffed animal, usually seated at an off-kilter angle and blankly staring into space. The true nature of the character is never resolved, instead as Watterson describes, a 'grown-up' version of reality is juxtaposed against Calvin's, with the reader left to \"decide which is truer\".{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nHobbes is named after the 17th-century philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]], who held what Watterson describes as \"a dim view of human nature.\"<ref name=\"Watterson 1995\">[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]].</ref> He typically exhibits a greater understanding of consequences than Calvin, although rarely intervenes in Calvin's activities beyond a few oblique warnings.

Calvin's father is a [[patent attorney]] (like Watterson's own father)<ref name=\"Watterson 1995\" /> and his mother is a [[Homemaker|stay-at-home mom]]. Watterson says, \"As far as the strip is concerned, they are important only as Calvin's mom and dad.\" Like many other characters in the strip, they are relatively down to earth and their sensible attitudes serve as a foil for Calvin's outlandish behavior.\n\nWatterson says some fans are angered by the sometimes sardonic way that Calvin's parents respond to him.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p.23</ref> Watterson defends what Calvin's parents do, remarking that in the case of parenting a kid like Calvin, \"I think they do a better job than I would.\" Calvin's father is overly concerned with \"character building\" activities in a number of strips, either in the things he makes Calvin do or in the masochistic eccentricities of his own lifestyle.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 194.</ref>\n\n===Susie Derkins===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Susie Derkins\n| series           = <!-- use without the italic on the outside -->\n| image            = Susie Derkins.png\n| image_size       = \n| alt              = \n| caption          = Susie Derkins, Calvin's classmate\n| first            = December 5, 1985\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Bill Watterson]]\n| lbl1             = Comic\n| data1            = ''Calvin and Hobbes''\n}}\n\n[[Susie Derkins]], who first appeared early in the strip and is the only important character with both a first and last name, lives on Calvin's street and is one of his classmates.

However, she is also depicted playing imaginary games with Calvin in which she is a high-powered lawyer or politician and he is her [[househusband]]. Though both of them hate to admit it, Calvin and Susie have quite a bit in common. For example, Susie is shown on occasion with a stuffed bunny rabbit named \"[[Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes#Mr. Bun|Mr. Bun]].\" Susie also has a mischievous (and sometimes aggressive) streak, which can be seen when she subverts Calvin's attempts to cheat on school tests by feeding him incorrect answers, or when she clobbers Calvin after he attacks her with snowballs. Susie also regularly bests Calvin in confrontations such as their water balloon and snowball fights, employing guile or force.\n\nHobbes often openly expresses romantic feelings for Susie, much to Calvin's disgust. Calvin starts a \"club\" (of which he and Hobbes are the only members) that he calls G.R.O.S.S. ('''G'''et '''R'''id '''O'''f '''S'''limy Girl'''S'''), and while holding \"meetings\" in Calvin's treehouse or in the \"box of secrecy\" in Calvin's room, they usually come up with some way to annoy or discomfit Susie, most of which backfire on them completely. In one instance, Calvin steals one of Susie's dolls for ransom, only to have Susie retaliate by nabbing Hobbes.  Watterson admits that Calvin and Susie have a nascent crush on each other, and that Susie is inspired by the type of woman whom Watterson himself found attractive and eventually married.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995\" />\n\n===Secondary characters===\n{{See also|Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes}}Calvin also interacts with a handful of secondary characters. Several of these, including '''Rosalyn''' his [[babysitter]], '''Mrs Wormwood''' his teacher and '''Moe''' the school bully reoccur regularly through the duration of the strip.\n\n==Recurring elements==\n===Art and academia===\nWatterson used the strip to poke fun at the art world, principally through Calvin's unconventional creations of [[snowman|snowmen]] but also through other expressions of childhood art. When Miss Wormwood complains that he is wasting class time drawing impossible things (a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' in a rocket ship, for example), Calvin proclaims himself \"on the cutting edge of the ''[[avant-garde]]''.\"<ref>{{Cite comic|cartoonist=Bill Watterson|title=Calvin and Hobbes|date=October 31, 1990|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|cartoonist=Bill Watterson|title=Calvin and Hobbes|date=November 1, 1990|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing}}</ref> He begins exploring the medium of snow when a warm day melts his snowman. His next sculpture \"speaks to the horror of our own mortality, inviting the viewer to contemplate the evanescence of life.\" In later strips, Calvin's creative instincts diversify to include sidewalk drawings (or, as he terms them, examples of \"suburban [[postmodernism]]\").\n\nWatterson also lampooned the [[academia|academic world]].  In one example, Calvin carefully crafts an \"[[artist's statement]]\", claiming that such essays convey more messages than artworks themselves ever do (Hobbes blandly notes, \"You misspelled ''[[World view|Weltanschauung]]''\").<ref>{{Cite comic|cartoonist=Bill Watterson|title=Calvin and Hobbes|date=July 15, 1995}}</ref> He indulges in what Watterson calls \"pop [[psychobabble]]\" to justify his destructive rampages and shift blame to his parents, citing \"toxic codependency.\"<ref>{{Cite comic|cartoonist=Bill Watterson|title=Calvin and Hobbes|date=January 21, 1993}}</ref> In one instance, he pens a book report based on the theory that the purpose of academic writing is to \"inflate weak ideas, obscure poor reasoning, and inhibit clarity,\" entitled ''The Dynamics of Interbeing and Monological Imperatives in ''[[Dick and Jane]]:'' A Study in Psychic Transrelational Gender Modes''.

These are as follows:\n\n===Calvin's roles and alter-egos===\nCalvin imagines himself as a great many things including [[dinosaur]]s, elephants, jungle-farers and superheroes. Three of his [[alter ego]]s are well defined and recurrent:\n\n*{{anchor|Spaceman Spiff}}\"Spaceman Spiff\" is a heroic spacefarer who narrates his experiences in the third person. As Spiff, Calvin battles aliens (typically his parents or teacher, but also sometimes other kids his age) with a ray gun known as a \"zorcher\" (later \"frap-ray blaster\", \"death ray blaster\" or \"atomic napalm neutralizer\") and travels to distant planets (his house, school, or neighborhood), often crashing unhurt on a planet. Calvin's self-narration as Spaceman Spiff is frequently riddled with alliteration: \"Zounds! Zorched by Zarches, Spaceman Spiff's crippled craft crashes on planet Plootarg!\"  Watterson has stated the idea of Spaceman Spiff was from an earlier drawing he made.\n* \"Tracer Bullet\" is a [[hardboiled]] private eye, who says he has eight slugs in him (\"One's lead, and the rest are bourbon.\"). In one story, Bullet is called to a case in which a \"pushy dame\" (Calvin's mother) accuses him of destroying an expensive lamp (broken during an indoor football game between Calvin and Hobbes). Later, he is snatched by the pushy dame's \"hired goon\" (Calvin's father having a talk with him). He made his debut when Calvin donned a [[fedora]] to hide a haircut Hobbes had given him. These strips are drawn in elaborate, shadowy black-and-white that evoke [[film noir]]. Watterson did not attempt Tracer Bullet stories often, due to the time-consuming way the strip needed to be drawn and inked.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 132.</ref>\n{{anchor|Stupendous Man}}\n* As \"Stupendous Man\" he pictures himself as a superhero in disguise, wearing a mask and a cape made by his mother, and narrating his own adventures. While in character as Stupendous Man, he refers to his alter ego as a mild-mannered millionaire playboy. Stupendous Man almost always \"suffers defeat\" at the hands of his opponent. When Hobbes asks if Stupendous Man has ever won any battles, Calvin says all his battles are \"moral victories.\" Stupendous Man's nemeses include \"Mom-Lady\" (Calvin's mom), \"Annoying Girl\" (Susie Derkins), \"Crab Teacher\" (Miss Wormwood), and \"Baby-Sitter Girl\" (Rosalyn). Some of the \"super powers\" of the villains have been revealed: Mom-Lady has a \"mind scrambling eyeball ray\" that wills the victim to \"do her nefarious bidding,\" and Baby Sitter Girl has a similar power of using a \"psycho beam\" which weakens \"Stupendous Man's stupendous will\". The \"powers\" of Annoying Girl and Crab Teacher are unknown. Calvin often tries to pretend he and \"Stupendous Man\" are two different people, but it never seems to work. Stupendous Man has multiple \"superpowers\", including, but not limited to, super strength, the ability to fly, various vision powers such as \"high-speed vision\", \"muscles of magnitude\", and a stomach of steel.\n\n===Cardboard boxes===\n[[File:Scientific Progress Goes Boink (Calvin and Hobbes).jpg|thumb|Calvin duplicating himself using a cardboard box, as seen on the cover of ''Scientific Progress Goes \"Boink\"'']]\nCalvin has had several adventures involving corrugated [[cardboard box]]es, which he adapts for many different uses. In one strip, when Calvin shows off his [[Transmogrify|Transmogrifier]], a device that transforms its user into any desired creature or item, Hobbes remarks, \"It's amazing what they do with corrugated cardboard these days.\"<ref name=\"watterson1988_p229\">{{cite book |last=Watterson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Watterson |title=[[List of Calvin and Hobbes books|The Essential Calvin and Hobbes: A Calvin and Hobbes Treasury]] |year=1988 |publisher=Andrews and McMeel |location=Kansas City, Missouri |isbn=0-8362-1805-1 |page=229}}</ref> Calvin is able to change the function of the boxes by rewriting the label and flipping the box onto another side. In this way, a cardboard box can be used not only for its conventional purposes (a storage container for water balloons, for example), but also as a flying [[Time travel|time machine]], a duplicator or, with the attachment of a few wires and a colander, a \"Cerebral Enhance-o-tron.\"\n\nIn the real world, Calvin's antics with his box have had varying effects. When he transmogrified into a tiger, he still appeared as a regular human child to his parents. However, in a story where he made several duplicates of himself, his parents are seen interacting with what does seem like multiple Calvins, including in a strip where two of him are seen in the same panel as his father. It is ultimately unknown what his parents do or do not see, as Calvin tries to hide most of his creations (or conceal their effects) so as not to traumatize them.\n\nIn addition, Calvin uses a cardboard box as a desk when he is attempting to sell things. Often, Calvin's merchandise is something that no one would want, such as \"suicide drink\", \"a swift kick in the butt\" for one dollar,<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 172.</ref> or a \"frank appraisal of your looks\" for fifty cents. In one strip, he sells \"happiness\" for ten cents; if one bought it, Calvin hit the person in the face with a water balloon, then revealed that he meant his own happiness. In another strip, he sold \"insurance\", firing a slingshot at those who refused to buy it. In some strips, he tried to sell \"great ideas\", and in one earlier strip, he attempted to sell the family car to obtain money for a grenade launcher. In yet another strip, he sells \"life\" for five cents, where the customer receives nothing in return, which, in Calvin's opinion, is life.\n\nThe box has also functioned as a secret meeting place for G.R.O.S.S., as the \"Box of Secrecy\".\n[[File:Calvin and Hobbes playing Calvinball.jpg|thumb|296x296px|Calvin and Hobbes playing Calvinball with an assortment of sporting equipment.]]\n\n===Calvinball===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 25em\n| quote = <poem>\nOther kids' games are all such a bore!\nThey've gotta have rules and they gotta keep score!\nCalvinball is better by far!\nIt's never the same!

Calvinball is a [[nomic]] or self-modifying game, a contest of wits, skill and creativity rather than stamina or athletic skill. The game is portrayed as a rebellion against conventional team team sports<ref name=\"CC+H_b2_p268-273\">[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, pp. 268\u2013273.

The only consistent rules of the game is that Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice<ref>[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, p. 292. Comic originally published 1990-05-27.</ref> and that the participant must be wearing a mask<ref name=\"CC+H_b3_p430-433\">[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 3, pp. 430\u2013434.

Scoring is portrayed as arbitrary and nonsensical (\"Q to 12\" and \"oogy to boogy\"<ref>[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, pp. 292, 336.

He uses the snowman for social commentary, revenge, or pure enjoyment. Examples include Snowman Calvin being yelled at by Snowman Dad to shovel the snow; one snowman eating snow cones scooped out of a second snowman, who is lying on the ground with an ice-cream scoop in his back; a \"snowman house of horror\"; and snowmen representing the people he hates. \"The ones I ''really'' hate are small, so they'll melt faster,\" he says. There was even an occasion on which Calvin accidentally brought a snowman to life and it made itself and a small army into \"deranged mutant killer monster snow goons.\"\n\nCalvin's snow art is often used as a commentary on art in general. For example, Calvin has complained more than once about the lack of originality in other people's snow art and compared it with his own grotesque snow sculptures. In one of these instances, Calvin and Hobbes claim to be the sole guardians of high culture; in another, Hobbes admires Calvin's willingness to put artistic integrity above marketability, causing Calvin to reconsider and make an ordinary snowman.\n\n===Wagon and sled===\nCalvin and Hobbes frequently ride downhill in a [[wagon]], [[sled]], or [[toboggan]], depending on the season, as a device to add some physical comedy to the strip and because, according to Watterson, \"it's a lot more interesting ... than talking heads.\"<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 104\">{{harvp|Watterson|1995|p=104}}</ref> While the ride is sometimes the focus of the strip,<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, pp. 233, 325.

The club was founded in the garage of their house.  To clear space for its activities, Calvin and (purportedly) Hobbes push Calvin's parents' car, causing it to roll into a ditch (but not suffer damage); the incident necessitates changing the club's location to Calvin's treehouse. They hold meetings to attempt to annoy Susie Derkins. Notable actions include planting a fake secret tape near her in attempt to draw her in to a trap, trapping her in a closet at their house, and creating elaborate water balloon traps. Calvin gave himself and Hobbes important positions in the club, Calvin being \"Dictator-for-Life\" and Hobbes being \"President-and-First-Tiger\". They go into Calvin's treehouse for their club meetings and often get into fights during them. The password to get into the treehouse is intentionally long and difficult, which has on at least one occasion ruined Calvin's plans. As Hobbes is able to climb the tree without the rope, he is usually the one who comes up with the password, which often involves heaping praise upon tigers. An example of this can be seen in the comic strip where Calvin, rushing to get into the treehouse to throw things at a passing Susie Derkins, insults Hobbes, who is in the treehouse and thus has to let down the rope. Hobbes forces Calvin to say the password for insulting him. By the time Susie arrives, in time to hear Calvin saying some of the password, causing him to stumble, Calvin is on \"''Verse Seven:'' Tigers are perfect!/The E-pit-o-me/of good looks and grace/and quiet..uh..um..dignity\". The opportunity to pelt Susie with something having passed, Calvin threatens to turn Hobbes into a rug.<ref name=\"watterson1990_p36\">{{cite book |last=Watterson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Watterson |title=[[List of Calvin and Hobbes books|Weirdos from Another Planet!]] |year=1990 |publisher=Andrews and McMeel |location=Kansas City, Missouri |isbn=0-8362-1862-0 |page=36}}</ref> G.R.O.S.S. is one of the most common adventures that Calvin has.

These include 11 collections, which form a complete archive of the newspaper strips, except for a single daily strip from November 28, 1985. (The collections ''do'' contain a strip for this date, but it is not the same strip that appeared in some newspapers. Treasuries usually combine the two preceding collections with bonus material and include color reprints of Sunday comics.)\n\nWatterson included some new material in the treasuries. In ''The Essential Calvin and Hobbes'', which includes cartoons from the collections ''Calvin and Hobbes'' and ''Something Under the Bed Is Drooling'', the back cover features a scene of a giant Calvin rampaging through a town. The scene is based on Watterson's home town of [[Chagrin Falls, Ohio]], and Calvin is holding the [[Chagrin Falls Popcorn Shop]], an iconic candy and ice cream shop overlooking the town's namesake falls.<ref name=\"APWattersonPrivacy\">{{cite news|url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cprivacy.html |title=Calvin and Hobbes Creator Keeps Privacy |last=Milicia |first=Joe |date=October 22, 2005 |agency=[[Associated Press]] via Calvin and Hobbes: Magic on Paper (fan site) |accessdate=April 29, 2009 |archivedate=June 7, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607004646/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cprivacy.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> Several of the treasuries incorporate additional poetry; ''The Indispensable Calvin and Hobbes'' book features a set of poems, ranging from just a few lines to an entire page, that cover topics such as Calvin's mother's \"hindsight\" and exploring the woods.

Early membership consisted of the four founders and their friends. Yet interest in CAMRA and its objectives spread rapidly, with 5,000 members signed up by 1973. Other early influential members included Christopher Hutt, author of ''Death of the English Pub'', who succeeded Hardman as chairman, Frank Baillie, author of ''The Beer Drinker's Companion'', and later the many times ''[[Good Beer Guide]]'' editor, [[Roger Protz]].\n\nOn 31 March 2016, founder Michael Hardman returned to chair a Revitalisation Project Steering Group. The aim of the Revitalisation Project was to review the organisation's purpose and future direction. Consultation meetings took place in the spring and summer of 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/revitalisation/events|title=CAMRA's Revitalisation Project Events - CAMRA|website=CAMRA|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> and further discussion took place at the Bournemouth AGM and Conference in spring 2017 leading to possible refinement of proposals then subject to a final vote of all members at spring 2018's AGM and Conference. At that 2018 meeting all but one of the proposed special resolutions were passed by voting, which all members could participate in.

It also maintains a [[CAMRA Pub Heritage Group|National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors]] to help bring greater recognition and protection to Britain's most historic pubs. In 2013 CAMRA launched public access to a national pub database website called Whatpub.com.\n\n==Festivals==\n[[File:GBBF 2.jpg|thumb|Great British Beer Festival 2004]]\nCAMRA supports and promotes beer and cider festivals around the country, which are organised by local CAMRA branches. Generally, each festival charges an entry fee which either covers entry only or also includes a commemorative glass showing the details of the festival. A festival programme is usually also provided, with a list and description of the drinks available.<ref>[http://www.camra.org.uk/beerfestivals List of upcoming CAMRA beer festivals]</ref> Members often get discounted or free entrance to CAMRA festivals. \n\nThe Campaign also organises the annual [http://www.gbbf.org.uk/ Great British Beer Festival] in August. It is now held in the Great, National & West Halls at the [[Olympia, London|Olympia Exhibition Centre]], in [[Kensington]], London, having been held for a few years at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl's Court]] as well as regionally in the past at venues such as Brighton and Leeds.\n\n==Awards==\nCAMRA presents awards for beers and pubs, such as the [[National Pub of the Year]], in which approximately 4,000 active CAMRA members from 200 local branches vote for their favourite pub of the year. The branch winners are entered into 16 regional competitions which are then visited by several individuals who select the ones they like best. There are also the [[Pub Design Awards]], which are held in association with [[English Heritage]] and the [[Victorian Society]].  These comprise several categories, including new build, refurbished and converted pubs.  The best known CAMRA award is the [[Champion Beer of Britain]],<ref>{{citation\n|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/cbob\n|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale\n|title=Champion Beer of Britain\n|accessdate=25 July 2013\n}}</ref> which is selected at the [[Great British Beer Festival]], other awards include the [[Champion Beer of Scotland]] and the [[Champion Beer of Wales]].\n\n==National Beer Scoring Scheme==\nCAMRA developed the National Beer Scoring Scheme<ref>{{citation\n|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/nbss\n|title=National Beer Scoring Scheme\n|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale\n|date=12 January 2006\n|first=Brett|last=Laniosh\n|accessdate=25 July 2013\n}}</ref> (NBSS) as an easy to use scheme for judging beer quality in pubs, to assist CAMRA branches in selecting pubs for the ''Good Beer Guide''.

The essential idea is that a radioactive species will capture a proton before it can beta decay, opening new nuclear burning pathways that are otherwise inaccessible.  Because of the higher temperatures involved, these catalytic cycles are typically referred to as the hot CNO cycles; because the timescales are limited by beta decays instead of proton captures, they

When the cycle is run to equilibrium, the ratio of the carbon-12/carbon-13 nuclei is driven to 3.5, and nitrogen-14 becomes the most numerous nucleus, regardless of initial composition.  During a star's evolution, convective mixing episodes moves material, within which the CNO cycle has operated, from the star's interior to the surface, altering the observed composition of the star. [[Red giant]] stars are observed to have lower carbon-12/carbon-13 and carbon-12/nitrogen-14 ratios than do [[main sequence]] stars, which is considered to be convincing evidence for the operation of the CNO cycle.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Stellar nucleosynthesis]], the whole topic\n* [[Triple-alpha process]], how {{SimpleNuclide2|carbon|12}} is produced from lighter nuclei\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal\n |last=Bethe |first=H.

Players may wager money against each other (playing \"street craps\") or a bank (playing \"[[casino]] craps\", also known as \"table craps\", or often just \"craps\").  Because it requires little equipment, \"street craps\" can be played in informal settings. While shooting craps, players may use [[Glossary of craps terms|slang terminology]] to place bets and actions.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}\nCraps developed in the United States from a simplification of the western European game of [[Hazard (game)|hazard]]. The origins of hazard are obscure and may date to the [[Crusades]].  Hazard was brought from [[London]] to [[New Orleans]] in approximately 1807 by the returning [[Bernard de Marigny|Bernard Xavier Philippe de Marigny de Mandeville]], the young gambler and scion of a family of wealthy [[Louisiana (New France)|colonial Louisiana]] landowners.<ref>Bridges, Tyler, Bad Bet in the Bayou Farrar, Straus & Giroux (2001)</ref> Although in hazard the dice shooter may choose any number from five to nine to be the main number, de Marigny simplified the game such that the main number is always seven, the optimal choice among knowledgeable hazard players. Both hazard and its new offshoot were unfamiliar and rejected by Americans of his social class, leading de Marigny to introduce his novelty to the local underclass. Fieldhands taught their friends, and deckhands carried the new game up the Mississippi River. Celebrating the popular success of his novelty, de Marigny gave the name craps to a street in his New Orleans real estate development.\n\nThe central game, called \"pass\", from the French word for \"pace\" or \"step\", has been gradually supplemented over the decades by many companion games which can be played simultaneously. The entire collection of over one hundred separate and independent possible games is called craps. The name ''craps'' was a Louisiana mispronunciation of the word ''crabs'', which in London had been the joint epithet for the numbers two and three, which in hazard are the only permanent instant losing numbers for wagers on Pass.\n\nFor a century after its invention, craps was abused by casinos using unfair dice. To remedy the problem, in approximately 1907, a [[Philadelphia]] dice maker named John H. Winn introduced a layout which featured bets on both Pass and Don't Pass. Most modern casinos use his innovation.\n\n[[File:Truants, \"Red St. Clair,\" and chum shooting craps in front of Murphy's Branch at 11-00 A.M. a school day. Red is boss... - NARA - 523289.jpg|thumb|Craps being played by children in a street in [[St Louis, Missouri]], circa 1912]]\n\nCraps exploded in popularity during [[World War II]], which brought most young American men of every social class into the military.  The street version of craps was popular among soldiers, who often played it using a blanket as a shooting surface. Their military memories led to craps becoming the dominant game in postwar Las Vegas.\n\n==Bank craps==\n{{more footnotes|section|date=April 2018}}\nBank craps or casino craps is played by one or more players betting against the casino rather than each other. Both the players and the dealers stand around a large rectangular craps table. Sitting is discouraged by most casinos unless a player has medical reasons for requiring a seat.\n\n===Craps table===\n[[File:Craps.svg|thumb|The layout of a craps table]]\nPlayers use casino checks rather than cash to bet on the Craps \"layout,\" a fabric surface which displays the various bets. The bets vary somewhat among casinos in availability, locations, and payouts. The tables roughly resemble bathtubs and come in various sizes.\n\nAgainst one long side is the casino's table bank: as many as two thousand casino checks in stacks of 20. The opposite long side is usually a long mirror. The U-shaped ends of the table have duplicate layouts and standing room for approximately eight players. In the center of the layout is an additional group of bets which are used by players from both ends. The vertical walls at each end are usually covered with a rubberized target surface covered with small pyramid shapes to randomize the dice which strike them.  The top edges of the table walls have one or two horizontal grooves in which players may store their reserve checks.\n\nThe table is run by up to four casino employees: a boxman seated (usually the only seated employee) behind the casino's bank, who manages the chips, supervises the dealers, and handles \"coloring up\" players (exchanging small chip denominations for larger denominations in order to preserve the chips at a table); two base dealers who stand to either side of the boxman and collect and pay bets to players around their half of the table; and a stickman who stands directly across the table from the boxman, takes and pays (or directs the base dealers to do so) the bets in the center of the table, announces the results of each roll (usually with a distinctive patter), and moves the dice across the layout with an elongated wooden stick.\n\nEach employee also watches for mistakes by the others because of the sometimes large number of bets and frantic pace of the game. In smaller casinos or at quiet times of day, one or more of these employees may be missing, and have their job covered by another, or cause player capacity to be reduced.\n\nSome smaller casinos have introduced \"mini-craps\" tables which are operated with only two dealers; rather than being two essentially identical sides and the center area, a single set of major bets is presented, split by the center bets. Responsibility of the dealers is adjusted: the stickman continuing to handle the center bets, and the base dealer handling the other bets as well as cash and chip exchanges.\n\nBy contrast, in \"street craps\", there is no marked table and often the game is played with no back-stop against which the dice are to hit. (Despite the name \"street craps\", this game is often played in houses, usually on an un-carpeted garage or kitchen floor.) The wagers are made in cash, never in chips, and are usually thrown down onto the ground or floor by the players. There are no attendants, and so the progress of the game, fairness of the throws, and the way that the payouts are made for winning bets are self-policed by the players.<ref name=\"scarne\">{{cite book|last1=Scarne|first1=John|title=Scarne's new complete guide to gambling|date=1986|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-0671630638|edition=Fully rev., expanded, updated}}</ref>\n\n===Rules of play===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}\n{{Anchor|Rules of play against a bank or casino}}<!--Previous section name-->\nEach casino may set which bets are offered and different payouts for them, though a core set of bets and payouts is typical. Players take turns rolling two [[dice]] and whoever is throwing the dice is called the \"shooter\". Players can bet on the various options by placing chips directly on the appropriately-marked sections of the layout, or asking the base dealer or stickman to do so, depending on which bet is being made.\n\nWhile acting as the shooter, a player must have a bet on the \"Pass\" line and/or the \"Don't Pass\" line. \"Pass\" and \"Don't Pass\" are sometimes called \"Win\" and \"Don't Win\" or \"Right\" and \"Wrong\" bets. The game is played in rounds and these \"Pass\" and \"Don't Pass\" bets are betting on the outcome of a round. The shooter is presented with multiple dice (typically five) by the \"stickman\", and must choose two for the round. The remaining dice are returned to the stickman's bowl and are not used.\n\n[[File:Craps.jpg|thumb|left|A roll of 11 in the come-out phase is a \"natural\".]]\nEach round has two phases: \"come-out\" and \"point\". Dice are passed to the left.  To start a round, the shooter makes one or more \"come-out\" rolls. The shooter must shoot toward the farther back wall and is generally required to hit the farther back wall with both dice. Casinos may allow a few warnings before enforcing the dice to hit the back wall and are generally lenient if at least one die hits the back wall. Both dice must be tossed in one throw. If only one die is thrown the shot is invalid.  A come-out roll of 2, 3 or 12 is called \"craps\" or \"crapping out\", and anyone betting the Pass line loses. On the other hand, anyone betting the Don't Pass line on come out wins with a roll of 2 or 3 and ties (pushes) if a 12 is rolled. Shooters may keep rolling after crapping out; the dice are only required to be passed if a shooter sevens out (rolls a seven after a point has been established). A come-out roll of 7 or 11 is a \"[[natural (gambling)|natural]]\"; the Pass line wins and Don't Pass loses. The other possible numbers are the point numbers: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. If the shooter rolls one of these numbers on the come-out roll, this establishes the \"point\" \u2013 to \"pass\" or \"win\", the point number must be rolled again before a seven.\n\nThe dealer flips a button to the \"On\" side and moves it to the point number signifying the second phase of the round. If the shooter \"hits\" the point value again (any value of the dice that sum to the point will do; the shooter doesn't have to exactly repeat the exact combination of the come-out roll) before rolling a seven, the Pass line wins and a new round starts. If the shooter rolls any seven before repeating the point number (a \"seven-out\"), the Pass line loses, the Don't Pass line wins, and the dice pass clockwise to the next new shooter for the next round. Once a point has been established any multi-roll bet (including Pass and/or Don't Pass line bets and odds) are unaffected by the 2, 3, 11 or 12, the only numbers which affect the round are the established point, any specific bet on a number, or any 7. Any single roll bet is always affected (win or lose) by the outcome of any roll.\n\nWhile the come-out roll may specifically refer to the first roll of a new shooter, any roll where no point is established may be referred to as a come-out. By this definition the start of any new round regardless if it is the shooter's first toss can be referred to as a come-out roll.\n\nAny player can make a bet on pass or don't pass as long as a point has not been established, or come or don't come as long as a point is established. All other bets, including an increase in odds behind the pass and don't pass lines, may be made at any time. All bets other than pass line and come may be removed or reduced any time before the bet loses. This is known as \"taking it down\" in craps.\n\nThe maximum bet for Place, Buy, Lay, Pass and Come bets are generally equal to table maximum. Lay bet maximum are equal to the table maximum win, so if a player wishes to lay the 4 or 10, he or she may bet twice at amount of the table maximum for the win to be table maximum. Odds behind Pass, Come, Don't Pass and Don't Come may be however larger than the odds offered allows and can be greater than the table maximum in some casinos. Don't odds are capped on the maximum allowed win some casino allow the odds bet itself to be larger than the maximum bet allowed as long as the win is capped at maximum odds. Single rolls bets can be lower than the table minimum, but the maximum bet allowed is also lower than the table maximum. The maximum allowed single roll bet is based on the maximum allowed win from a single roll.\n\nIn all the above scenarios, whenever the Pass line wins, the Don't Pass line loses, and [[vice versa]], with one exception: on the come-out roll, a roll of 12 will cause Pass Line bets to lose, but Don't Pass bets are pushed (or \"barred\"), neither winning nor losing. (The same applies to \"Come\" and \"Don't Come\" bets, discussed below.)\n\n===Joining a game===\nA player wishing to play craps without being the shooter should approach the craps table and first check to see if the dealer's \"On\" button is on any of the point numbers.{{Citation needed |date=December 2013|reason=Section should probably be removed because it is in \"how-to manual\" style, which is against MOS. The individual bets affected should be notated with diffs in betting them when the point is already established.}}\n\n* If the button has been turned to \"Off\", then the table is in the come-out round, and a point has not been established.\n* If the dealer's button is \"On\", the table is in the point round where casinos will allow odds behind an existing Pass line to be bet. Some casino do not allow new pass line bets while a point has been established. Some casinos will place the bet straddling the outer border of the pass line so as to indicate that it is to be paid the same odds as a place bet, instead of just even money. Other casinos will take the bet on the pass line after a point has been established, known as put betting, which is a disadvantage to the player (since the seven is the most common roll and likely to happen before the \"point\").\n\nIn either case, all single or multi-roll proposition bets may be placed in either of the two rounds.\n\nBetween dice rolls there is a period for dealers to make payouts and collect losing bets, after which players can place new bets.  The stickman monitors the action at a table and decides when to give the shooter the dice, after which no more betting is allowed.\n\nWhen joining the game, one should place money on the table rather than passing it directly to a dealer, the dealer's exaggerated movements during the process of \"making change\" or \"change only\" (converting currency to an equivalent in casino cheques) are required so that any disputes can be later reviewed against security camera footage.\n\n===Rolling===\nThe dealers will insist that the shooter roll with one hand and that the dice bounce off the far wall surrounding the table. These requirements are meant to keep the game fair (preventing switching the dice or making a \"controlled shot\"). If a die leaves the table, the shooter will usually be asked to select another die from the remaining three but can request permission to use the same die if it passes the boxman's inspection. This requirement exists to keep the game fair and reduce the chance of [[loaded dice]].\n\n{{Crapsrolls}}\n\nThere are many local variants of the calls made by the stickman for rolls during a craps game. These often incorporate a reminder to the dealers as to which bets to pay or collect.\n\n* Two is \"snake eyes\", because the two ones that compose it look like a pair of small, beady eyes. During actual play, more common terms are \"two craps two\" during the comeout roll because the pass line bet is lost on a comeout crap roll and/or because a bet on any craps would win. \"Aces; double the field\" would be a more common call when not on the comeout roll to remind the dealers to pay double on the field bets and encourage the field bettor to place subsequent bets and/or when no crap bets have been placed.  Another name for the two is \"loose deuce\".\n* Three is typically called as \"three craps three\" during the comeout roll, or \"three, ace deuce, come away single\" when not on the comeout to signify the come bet has been lost and to pay single to any field bettors.  Three may also be referred to as \"ace caught a deuce\", or even less often \"acey deucey\".\n* Four, usually hard, is sometimes referred to as \"Little Joe from Kokomo\" or \"Little Joe on the front row\" or just \"Little Joe\".  A hard four can be called a \"ballerina\" because it is two-two (\"[[ballet tutu|tutu]]\").\n* Five is often called \"no field five\" in casinos in which five is not one of the field rolls and thus not paid in the field bets. Other names for a five are \"fever\" and \"little Phoebe\".\n* Six may be referred to as \"Jimmie Hicks\" or \"Jimmie Hicks from the sticks\", examples of [[rhyming slang]].  On a win, the six is often called \"666 winner 6\" followed by \"came hard\" or \"came easy\".\n* Seven rolled as 6\u20131 is sometimes called \"six ace\" or \"up pops the Devil\".  Older dealers and players may use the term \"Big Red\" because craps tables once prominently featured a large red \"7\" in the center of the layout for the one-roll seven bet. During the comeout, the seven is called \"seven, front line winner\", frequently followed by \"pay the line\" and/or \"take the don'ts\".  After the point is established, a seven is typically called by simply \"7 out\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} or \"7 out 7\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}.\n*Eight rolled the hard way, as opposed to an \"easy eight\" is sometimes called an \"eighter from [[Decatur (disambiguation)|Decatur]]\". It can also be known as a \"square pair\", \"mom and dad\", or \"[[Ozzie and Harriet]]\".\n* Nine is called a \"centerfield nine\" in casinos in which nine is one of the field rolls, because nine is the center number shown on the layout in such casinos (2\u20133\u20134\u20139\u201310\u201311\u201312). In Atlantic City, a 4\u20135 is called a \"railroad nine\". The 4\u20135 nine is also known as \"Jesse James\" because the outlaw [[Jesse James]] was killed by a .45 caliber pistol. Other names for the nine include \"Nina from [[Pasadena (disambiguation)|Pasadena]]\", \"Nina at the [[Marina]]\", and \"niner from [[The Carolinas|Carolina]]\". Nine can also be referred to as \"Old Mike\", named after [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] Hall-of-Famer [[Michael Jordan]]. Jordan wore number 45 later on in his playing career.\n*Ten the hard way is \"a hard ten\", \"dos equis\" (Spanish, meaning \"two X's\", because the pip arrangement on both dice on this roll resembles \"XX\"),  or \"Hard ten \u2013 a woman's best friend\", an example of both rhyming slang and sexual [[double entendre]]. Ten as a pair of 5's may also be known as \"puppy paws\" or \"a pair of sunflowers\" or \"Big Dick\" or \"Big John.\" Another slang for a hard ten is \"moose head\", because it resembles a moose's antlers. This phrase came from players in the Pittsburgh area.\n*Eleven is called out as \"yo\" or \"[[yo-leven]]\" to prevent being misheard as \"seven\". An older term for eleven is \"six five, no jive\" because it is a winning roll.  During the comeout, eleven is typically followed by \"front line winner\".  After the point is established, \"good field and come\" is often added.\n*Twelve is known as \"boxcars\" because the spots on the two dice that show 6\u20136 look like schematic drawings of railroad [[boxcar]]s; it is also called \"midnight\", referring to twelve o'clock; and also as \"double-action field traction\", because of the (standard) 2-to-1 pay on Field bets for this roll and the fact that the arrangement of the pips on the two dice, when laid end-to-end, resemble tire tracks.  On tables that pay triple the field on a twelve roll, the stickman will often loudly exclaim \"triple\" either alone or in combination with \"12 craps 12\" or \"come away triple\".\n\nRolls of 4, 6, 8, and 10 are called \"hard\" or \"easy\" (e.g. \"six the hard way\", \"easy eight\", \"hard ten\") depending on whether they were rolled as a \"double\" or as any other combination of values, because of their significance in center table bets known as the \"hard ways\". Hard way rolls are so named because there is only one way to roll them (i.e., the value on each die is the same when the number is rolled). Consequently, it is more likely to roll the number in combinations (easy) rather than as a double (hard).\n\n==Types of wagers==\n[[File:Imperial_Palace,_Las_Vegas_(3192388546).jpg|thumb|A standard craps table]]\n\n===Line bets===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}\nThe shooter is required to make either a pass line bet or a Don't Pass bet if he wants to shoot. On the come out roll each player may only make one bet on the Pass or Don't Pass, but may bet both if desired. The Pass Line and Don't Pass bet is optional for any player not shooting. In rare cases, some casinos require all players to make a minimum Pass Line or Don't Pass bet (if they want to make any other bet), whether they are currently shooting or not.\n\n====Pass line====\nThe fundamental bet in craps is the pass line bet, which is a bet for the shooter to win. This bet must be at least the table minimum and at most the table maximum.\n* If the come-out roll is 7 or 11, the bet wins.\n* If the come-out roll is 2, 3 or 12, the bet loses (known as \"crapping out\").\n* If the roll is any other value, it establishes a point.\n** If, with a point established, that point is rolled again before a 7, the bet wins.\n** If, with a point established, a 7 is rolled before the point is rolled again (\"seven out\"), the bet loses.\nThe pass line bet pays even money.\n\nThe pass line bet is a contract bet.  Once a pass line bet is made, it is always working and cannot be turned \"Off\", taken down, or reduced until a decision is reached \u2013 the point is made, or the shooter sevens out. A player may increase any corresponding odds (up to the table limit) behind the Pass line at any time after a point is established. Players may only bet the pass line on the come out roll when no point has been established, unless the casino allows put betting where the player can bet Pass line or increase an existing Pass line bet whenever desired and may take odds immediately if the point is already on.\n\n====Don't pass====\nA don't pass bet is a bet for the shooter to lose (\"seven out, line away\") and is almost the opposite of the pass line bet. Like the Pass bet, this bet must be at least the table minimum and at most the table maximum.\n* If the come-out roll is 2 or 3, the bet wins.\n* If the come-out roll is 7 or 11, the bet loses.\n* If the come-out roll is 12, the bet is a push (neither won nor lost). In some casinos, the bet pushes on 2 and wins on 12 instead. Others allow the player to choose to either push on 2 (\"Bar Aces\") or push on 12 (\"Bar Sixes\") depending on where it is placed on the layout. The push on 12 or 2 is mathematically necessary to maintain the house edge over the player.\n* If the roll is any other value, it establishes a point.\n** If, with a point established, a 7 is rolled before the point is rolled again (\"seven out\"), the bet wins.\n** If, with a point established, that point is rolled again before a 7, the bet loses.\nThe don't pass bet pays even money.\n\nThe don't pass bet is a no-contract bet.  After a point is established, a player may take down or reduce a don't pass bet and any corresponding odds at any time because odds of rolling a 7 before the point is in the player's favor. Once taken down or reduced, however, the don't pass bet may not be restored or increased. Because the shooter must have a line bet the shooter generally may not reduce a don't pass bet below the table minimum. In [[Las Vegas]], a majority of casinos will allow the shooter to move the bet to the pass line in lieu of taking it down, however in other areas such as [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], this is not allowed. Even though players are allowed to remove the don't pass line bet after a point has been established, the bet cannot be turned \"Off\" without being removed. If a player chooses to remove the don't pass line bet, he or she can no longer lay odds behind the don't pass line. The player can, however, still make standard lay bets on any of the point numbers (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10).\n\nThere are two different ways to calculate the odds and house edge of this bet. The table below gives the numbers considering that the game ends in a push when a 12 is rolled, rather than being undetermined. Betting on don't pass is often called \"playing the dark side\", and it is considered by some players to be in poor taste, or even taboo, because it goes directly against conventional play, winning when most of the players lose.\n\n====Pass odds====\nIf a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 is thrown on the come-out roll (i.e., if a point is established), most casinos allow pass line players to take odds by placing up to some predetermined multiple of the pass line bet, behind the pass line.  This additional bet wins if the point is rolled again before a 7 is rolled (the point is made) and pays at the true odds of 2-to-1 if 4 or 10 is the point, 3-to-2 if 5 or 9 is the point, or 6-to-5 if 6 or 8 is the point. Unlike the pass line bet itself, the pass line odds bet can be turned \"Off\" (not working), removed or reduced anytime before it loses. In Las Vegas, generally odds bets are required to be the table minimum. In Atlantic City and Pennsylvania, the combine odds and pass bet must be table minimum so players can bet the minimum single unit on odds depending on the point. If the point is a 4 or 10 players can bet as little as $1 on odds if the table minimum is low such as is $5, $10 or $15. If the player requests the pass odds be not working (\"Off\") and the shooter sevens-out or hits the point, the pass line bet will be lost or doubled and the pass odds returned.\n\nIndividual casinos (and sometimes tables within a casino) vary greatly in the maximum odds they offer, from single or double odds (one or two times the pass line bet) up to 100x or even unlimited odds.  A variation often seen is \"3-4-5X Odds\", where the maximum allowed odds bet depends on the point: three times if the point is 4 or 10; four times on points of 5 or 9; or five times on points of 6 or 8. This rule simplifies the calculation of winnings: a maximum pass odds bet on a 3\u20134\u20135\u00d7 table will always be paid at six times the pass line bet regardless of the point.\n\nAs odds bets are paid at true odds, in contrast with the pass line which is always even money, taking odds on a minimum pass line bet lessens the house advantage compared with betting the same total amount on the pass line only. A maximum odds bet on a minimum pass line bet often gives the lowest house edge available in any game in the casino. However, the odds bet cannot be made independently, so the house retains an edge on the pass line bet itself.\n\n====Don't pass odds====\nIf a player is playing don't pass instead of pass, they may also lay odds by placing chips behind the don't pass line. If a 7 comes before the point is rolled, the odds pay at true odds of 1-to-2 if 4 or 10 is the point, 2-to-3 if 5 or 9 is the point, or 5-to-6 if 6 or 8 is the point. Typically the maximum lay bet will be expressed such that a player may win up to an amount equal to the maximum odds multiple at the table. If a player lays maximum odds with a point of 4 or 10 on a table offering five-times odds, he would be able to lay a maximum of ten times the amount of his Don't Pass bet.  At 5x odds table, the maximum amount the combined bet can win will always be 6x the amount of the Don't Pass bet. Players can bet table minimum odds if desired and win less than table minimum. Like the Don't Pass bet the odds can be removed or reduced. Unlike the don't pass bet itself, the don't pass odds can be turned \"Off\" (not working). In Las Vegas generally odds bets are required to be the table minimum. In Atlantic City and Pennsylvania, the combine lay odds and Don't Pass bet must be table minimum so players may bet as little as the minimum two units on odds depending on the point. If the point is a 4 or 10 players can bet as little as $2 if the table minimum is low such as $5, $10 or $15 tables. If the player requests the don't pass odds to be not working (\"Off\") and the shooter hits the point or sevens-out, the don't pass bet will be lost or doubled and the don't pass odds returned. Unlike a standard lay bet on a point, lay odds behind the Don't Pass line does not charge commission (vig).\n\n====Come bet====\nA Come bet can be visualized as starting an entirely new pass line bet, unique to that player. Like the Pass Line each player may only make one Come bet per roll, this does not exclude a player from betting odds on an already established Come point. This bet must be at least the table minimum and at most the table maximum. Players may bet both the Come and Don't Come on the same roll if desired. Come bets can only be made after a point has been established since, on the come-out roll, a Come bet would be the same thing as a pass line bet. A player making a Come bet will bet on the first point number that \"comes\" from the shooter's next roll, regardless of the table's round.  If a 7 or 11 is rolled on the first round, it wins. If a 2, 3, or 12 is rolled, it loses.  If instead the roll is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, the Come bet will be moved by the base dealer onto a box representing the number the shooter threw.  This number becomes the \"come-bet point\" and the player is allowed to take odds, just like a pass line bet. Also like a pass line bet, the come bet is a contract bet and is always working, and cannot be turned \"Off\", removed or reduced until it wins or loses. However, the odds taken behind a Come bet can be turned \"Off\" (not working), removed or reduced anytime before the bet loses. In Las Vegas generally odds bets are required to be the table minimum. In Atlantic City and Pennsylvania, the combine odds and pass bet must be table minimum so players can bet the minimum single unit depending on the point. If the point is a 4 or 10 players can bet as little as $1 if the table minimum is low such as $5, $10 or $15 minimums. If the player requests the Come odds to be not working (\"Off\") and the shooter sevens-out or hits the Come bet point, the Come bet will be lost or doubled and the Come odds returned. If the casino allows put betting a player may increase a Come bet after a point has been established and bet larger odds behind if desired. Put betting also allows a player to bet on a Come and take odds immediately on a point number without a Come bet point being established.\n\nThe dealer will place the odds on top of the come bet, but slightly off center in order to differentiate between the original bet and the odds.  The second round wins if the shooter rolls the come bet point again before a seven. Winning come bets are paid the same as winning pass line bets: even money for the original bet and true odds for the odds bet.  If, instead, the seven is rolled before the come-bet point, the come bet (and any odds bet) loses.\n\nBecause of the come bet, if the shooter makes their point, a player can find themselves in the situation where they still have a come bet (possibly with odds on it) and the next roll is a come-out roll. In this situation, odds bets on the come wagers are usually presumed to be not working for the come-out roll. That means that if the shooter rolls a 7 on the come-out roll, any players with active come bets waiting for a come-bet point lose their initial wager but will have their odds bets returned to them.\n\nIf the come-bet point is rolled on the come-out roll, the odds do not win but the come bet does and the odds bet is returned (along with the come bet and its payoff). The player can tell the dealer that they want their odds working, such that if the shooter rolls a number that matches the come point, the odds bet will win along with the come bet, and if a seven is rolled, both lose.\n\nMany players will use a come bet as \"insurance\" against sevening out: if the shooter rolls a seven, the come bet pays 1:1, offsetting the loss of the pass line bet.  The risk in this strategy is the situation where the shooter does not hit a seven for several rolls, leading to multiple come bets that will be lost if the shooter eventually sevens out.\n\n====Don't come bet====\nIn the same way that a come bet is similar to a pass line bet, a don't come bet is similar to a don't pass bet. Like the come, the don't come can only be bet after a point has already been established as it is the same as a don't pass line bet when no point is established. This bet must be at least the table minimum and at most the table maximum. A don't come bet is played in two rounds.  If a 2 or 3 is rolled in the first round, it wins. If a 7 or 11 is rolled, it loses.  If a 12 is rolled, it is a push (subject to the same 2/12 switch described above for the don't pass bet).  If, instead, the roll is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, the don't come bet will be moved by the base dealer onto a box representing the number the shooter threw.  The second round wins if the shooter rolls a seven before the don't come point. Like the Don't Pass each player may only make one Don't Come bet per roll, this does not exclude a player from laying odds on an already established Don't Come points. Players may bet both the Don't Come and Come on the same roll if desired.\n\nThe player may lay odds on a don't come bet, just like a don't pass bet; in this case, the dealer (not the player) places the odds bet on top of the bet in the box, because of limited space, slightly offset to signify that it is an odds bet and not part of the original don't come bet. Lay odds behind a Don't Come are subject to the same rules as Don't Pass lay odds. Unlike a standard lay bet on a point, lay odds behind a don't come point does not charge commission (vig) and gives the player true odds. Like the don't pass line bet, don't come bets are no-contract, and can be removed or reduced after a don't come point has been established, but cannot be turned off (\"not working\") without being removed.  A player may also call, \"No Action\" when a point is established, and the bet will not be moved to its point.  This play is not to the player's advantage.  If the bet is removed, the player can no longer lay odds behind the don't come point and cannot restore or increase the same don't come bet. Players must wait until next roll as long as a pass line point has been established (players cannot bet don't come on come out rolls) before they can make a new don't come bet. Las Vegas casinos which allow put betting allows players to move the Don't Come directly to any Come point as a put, however this is not allowed in Atlantic City or Pennsylvania. Unlike the don't come bet itself, the don't come odds can be turned \"Off\" (not working), removed or reduced if desired. In Las Vegas, players generally must lay at least table minimum on odds if desired and win less than table minimum, in Atlantic City and Pennsylvania players combined bet must be at least table minimum, so depending on the point number players may lay as little as 2 minimum units (e.g. 4 and 10). If the player requests the don't come odds be not working (\"Off\") and the shooter hits the don't come point or sevens-out, the don't come bet will be lost or doubled and the don't come odds returned.\n\nWinning don't come bets are paid the same as winning don't pass bets: even money for the original bet and true odds for the odds lay. Unlike come bets, the odds laid behind points established by don't come bets are always working including come out rolls unless the player specifies otherwise.\n\n===Multi-roll bets===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}\nThese are bets that may not be settled on the first roll and may need any number of subsequent rolls before an outcome is determined.\nMost multi-roll bets may fall into the situation where a point is made by the shooter before the outcome of the multi-roll bet is decided. These bets are often considered \"not working\" on the new come-out roll until the next point is established, unless the player calls the bet as \"working.\"\n\nCasino rules vary on this; some of these bets may not be callable, while others may be considered \"working\" during the come-out.  Dealers will usually announce if bets are working unless otherwise called off.  If a non-working point number placed, bought or laid becomes the new point as the result of a come-out, the bet is usually refunded, or can be moved to another number for free.\n\n====Place====\nPlayers can bet any point number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10) by placing their wager in the come area and telling the dealer how much and on what number(s), \"30 on the 6\", \"5 on the 5\" or \"25 on the 10\".  These are typically \"Place Bets to Win\".  These are bets that the number bet on will be rolled before a 7 is rolled. These bets are considered working bets, and will continue to be paid out each time a shooter rolls the number bet.  By rules, place bets are not working on the come out roll but can be \"turned on\" by the player. Players may remove or reduce (bet must be at least table minimum) this bet anytime before it loses (seven out).\n\nPlace bets to win payout at slightly worse than the true odds: 9-to-5 on points 4 or 10, 7-to-5 on points 5 or 9, and 7-to-6 on points 6 or 8. The place bets on the outside numbers (4,5,9,10) should be made in units of $5, (on a $5 minimum table), in order to receive the correct exact payout of $5 paying $7 or $5 paying $9. The place bets on the 6 & 8 should be made in units of $6, (on a $5 minimum table), in order to receive the correct exact payout of $6 paying $7.  For the 4 and 10, it is to the player's advantage to 'buy' the bet (see below).\n\nThere are also \"Place Bets to Lose\".  Rarely casinos offer these bets.  This bet is the opposite of the place bet to win and pays off if a 7 is rolled before the specific point number. The place bet to lose typically carries a lower house edge than a place bet to win.  Payouts are 4\u20135 on points 6 or 8, 5\u20138 on 5 or 9, and 5\u201311 on 4 or 10.\n\nIn most cases, there are other methods to bet on point numbers than placing them, depending how the casino charges commissions and what bets are allowed.  See Buy, Lay, and Put bets\n\n====Buy====\nPlayers can also buy a bet which are paid at true odds, but a 5% commission is charged on the amount of the bet. Buy bets are placed with the shooter betting at a specific number will come out before a player sevens out. The buy bet must be at least table minimum excluding commission, however some casinos require the minimum buy bet amount to be at least $20 to match the $1 charged on the 5% commission. Traditionally, the buy bet commission is paid no matter what, but in recent years a number of casinos have changed their policy to charge the commission only when the buy bet wins. Some casinos charge the commission as a one-time fee to buy the number; payouts are then always at true odds. Most casinos usually charge only $1 for a $25 green-chip bet (4% commission), or $2 for $50 (two green chips), reducing the house advantage a bit more. Players may remove or reduce this bet (bet must be at least table minimum excluding vig) anytime before it loses. Buy bets like place bets are not working when no point has been established unless the player specifies otherwise.\n\nWhere commission is charged only on wins, the commission is often deducted from the winning payoff\u2014a winning $25 buy bet on the 10 would pay $49, for instance. The house edges stated in the table assume the commission is charged on all bets. They are reduced by at least a factor of two if commission is charged on winning bets only.\n\n====Lay====\nA lay bet is the opposite of a buy bet, where a player bets on a 7 to roll before the number that is laid. Players may only lay the 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 and may lay multiple numbers if desired. Just like the buy bet lay bets pay true odds, but because the lay bet is the opposite of the buy bet, the payout is reversed. Therefore, players get 1 to 2 for the numbers 4 and 10, 2 to 3 for the numbers 5 and 9, and 5 to 6 for the numbers 6 and 8. A 5% commission (vigorish, vig, juice) is charged up front on the possible winning amount. For example: A $40 Lay Bet on the 4 would pay $20 on a win. The 5% vig would be $1 based on the $20 win. (not $2 based on the $40 bet as the way buy bet commissions are figured.) Like the buy bet the commission is adjusted to suit the betting unit such that fraction of a dollar payouts are not needed. Casinos may charge the vig up front thereby requiring the player to pay a vig win or lose, other casinos may only take the vig if the bet wins. Taking vig only on wins lowers house edge. Players may removed or reduce this bet (bet must be at least table minimum) anytime before it loses. Some casinos in Las Vegas allow players to lay table minimum plus vig if desired and win less than table minimum. Lay bet maximums are equal to the table maximum win, so if a player wishes to lay the 4 or 10, he or she may bet twice at amount of the table maximum for the win to be table maximum.  Other casinos require the minimum bet to win at $20 even at the lowest minimum tables in order to match the $1 vig, this requires a $40 bet. Similar to buy betting, some casinos only take commission on win reducing house edge. Unlike place and buy bets, lay bets are always working even when no point has been established. The player must specify otherwise if he or she wishes to have the bet not working.\n\nIf a player is unsure of whether a bet is a single or multi-roll bet, it can be noted that all single-roll bets will be displayed on the playing surface in one color (usually red), while all multi-roll bets will be displayed in a different color (usually yellow).\n\n====Put====\nA put bet is a bet which allows players to increase or make a Pass line bet after a point has been established (after come-out roll). Players may make a put bet on the Pass line and take odds immediately or increase odds behind if a player decides to add money to an already existing Pass line bet. Put betting also allows players to increase an existing come bet for additional odds after a come point has been established or make a new come bet and take odds immediately behind if desired without a come bet point being established. If increased or added put bets on the Pass line and Come cannot be turned \"Off\", removed or reduced, but odds bet behind can be turned \"Off\", removed or reduced. The odds bet is generally required to be the table minimum. Player cannot put bet the Don't Pass or Don't Come. Put betting may give a larger house edge over place betting unless the casino offers high odds.\n\nPut bets are generally allowed in [[Las Vegas]], but not allowed in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] and [[Pennsylvania]].\n\nPut bets are better than place bets (to win) when betting more than 5-times odds over the flat bet portion of the put bet.  For example, a player wants a $30 bet on the six.  Looking at two possible bets:  1)  Place the six, or  2)  Put the six with odds.  A $30 place bet on the six pays $35 if it wins.  A $30 put bet would be a $5 flat line bet plus $25 (5-times) in odds, and also would pay $35 if it wins.  Now, with a $60 bet on the six, the place bet wins $70, where the put bet ($5 + $55 in odds) would pay $71.  The player needs to be at a table which not only allows put bets, but also high-times odds, to take this advantage.\n\n====Hard way====\nThis bet can only be placed on the numbers 4, 6, 8, and 10. In order for this bet to win, the chosen number must be rolled the \"hard way\" (as doubles) before a 7 or any other non-double combination (\"easy way\") totaling that number is rolled. For example, a player who bets a hard 6 can only win by seeing a 3\u20133 roll come up before any 7 or any easy roll totaling 6 (4\u20132 or 5\u20131); otherwise, he/she loses.\n\nIn Las Vegas casinos, this bet is generally working, including when no point has been established, unless the player specifies otherwise. In other casinos such as those in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], hard ways are not working when the point is off unless the player requests to have it working on the come out roll.\n\nLike single-roll bets, hard way bets can be lower than the table minimum; however, the maximum bet allowed is also lower than the table maximum. The minimum hard way bet can be a minimum one unit. For example, lower stake table minimums of $5 or $10, generally allow minimum hard ways bets of $1. The maximum bet is based on the maximum allowed win from a single roll.\n\nEasy way is not a specific bet offered in standard casinos, but a term used to define any number combination which has two ways to roll. For example, (6\u20134, 4\u20136) would be a \"10 easy\". The 4, 6, 8 or 10 can be made both hard and easy ways. Betting point numbers (which pays off on easy or hard rolls of that number) or single-roll (\"hop\") bets (e.g., \"hop the 2\u20134\" is a bet for the next roll to be an easy six rolled as a two and four) are methods of betting easy ways.\n\n====Big 6 and Big 8====\nA player can choose either the 6 or 8 being rolled before the shooter throws a seven. These wagers are usually avoided by experienced craps players since they pay [[even money]] (1:1) while a player can make place bets on the 6 or the 8, which pay more (7:6).  Some casinos (especially all those in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]) do not even offer the Big 6 & 8. The bets are located in the corners behind the pass line, and bets may be placed directly by players.\n\nThe only real advantage offered by the Big 6 & 8 is that they can be bet for the table minimum, whereas a place bet minimum may sometimes be greater than the table minimum (e.g. $6 place bet on a $3 minimum game.) In addition place bets are usually not working, except by agreement, when the shooter is \"coming out\" i.e. shooting for a point, and Big 6 and 8 bets always work. Some modern layouts no longer show the Big 6/Big 8 bet.\n\n===Single roll bets===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}\nSingle-roll (proposition) bets are resolved in one dice roll by the shooter. Most of these are called \"Service Bets\", and they are located at the center of most craps tables. Only the stickman or a dealer can place a service bet. Single rolls bets can be lower than the table minimum, but the maximum bet allowed is also lower than the table maximum. The maximum bet is based on the maximum allowed win from a single roll. The lowest single roll bet can be a minimum one unit bet. For example, tables with minimums of $5 or $10 generally allow minimum single roll bets of $1. Single bets are always working by default unless the player specifies otherwise. The bets include:\n\n2 (snake eyes, or Aces): Wins if shooter rolls a 2.\n\n3 (ace-deuce): Wins if the shooter rolls a 3.\n\nYo: Wins if the shooter rolls 11.\n\n12 (boxcars, midnight, or cornrows): Wins if shooter rolls a 12.\n\n2 or 12 (hi-lo): Wins if shooter rolls a 2 or 12. The stickman places this bet on the line dividing the 2 and 12 bets.\n\nAny Craps (Three-Way): Wins if the shooter rolls 2, 3 or 12.\n\nC & E: A combined bet, a player is betting half their bet on craps (2,3,12) and the other half on 11 (yo). The combine payout is 3:1 on craps and 7:1 on 11 (yo). Another method of calculating the payout is to divide the total bet in half. The player would receive 7:1 minus half the total bet payout on half the total bet for craps and 15:1 minus half the total bet payout on half the total bet for 11 (yo). For example, using this method if a player were to bet $2 on C & E, $1 would receive 7:1 payout on craps minus $1 for the bet on 11 so the total profit would be $6. If an 11 was rolled the player would receive 15:1 minus $1 for the bet on craps so the player's total profit is $14. Both methods of calculation yield the same result so either method can be used. If a player wishes to take the bet down after a win the player would receive the whole bet not half even though only one of the two bets can win per roll. The minimum bet on C & E is double the lowest unit bet allowed at the table. So if the minimum single roll bet is $1 the lowest C & E bet allowed would be $2. Players are, however, able to make odd number bets larger than $2 if desired. One of the two bets will always lose, the other may win.\n\nAny seven: Wins if the shooter rolls a 7 with 4:1 payout. This bet is also nicknamed Big Red, since the 7 on its betting space on the layout is usually large and red, and it is considered bad luck{{by whom|date=May 2013}} and a breach of etiquette to speak the word \"seven\" at the table.\n\nHorn: This is a bet that involves betting on 1 unit each for 2, 3, 11 and 12 at the same time for the next roll. The bet is actually four separate bets, and pays off depending on which number is actually rolled. The combine payout is 27:4 for 2, 12 and 3:1 for 3, 11. Each individual bet has the same payout as a single bet on the specific numbers, 30:1 for 2 and 12 minus the other three bets, 15:1 for 3 and 11 minus the other three bets. If a player wins the bet he can take down all four bets instead of a single bet even though only one bet can win per roll. Many players, in order to eliminate the confusion of tossing four chips to the center of the table or having change made while bets are being placed, will make a five-unit Horn High bet, which is a four-way bet with the extra unit going to one specific number. For example, if one tosses a $5 chip into the center and says \"horn high yo\", you are placing four $1 bets on each of the horn numbers and the extra dollar will go on the yo (11). Horn bets are generally required to be in multiples of 4 or 5 with the minimum bet being 4 times the minimum unit allowed. For example, if the single roll minimum at the table is $1 the Horn bet must be $4 or more.\n\nWhirl or World: A five-unit bet that is a combination of a horn and any-seven bet, with the idea that if a seven is rolled the bet is a push, because the money won on the seven is lost on the horn portions of the bet. The combine odds are 26:5 on the 2, 12, 11:5 on the 3, 11, and a push on the 7. Like the C & E and Horn bet, if a player wishes to take down the bet after a win he or she would receive all five units back. The minimum bet is five of the minimum units. For example, if the minimum single roll bet is $1, the minimum World/Whirl bet is $5.\n\nOn the Hop, Hop or Hopping: A single roll bet on any particular combination of the two dice on the next roll including combinations whose sum is 7 (e.g. 4 and 3).  For example, if you bet on \"5 and 1\" on the hop, you are betting that the next roll will have a 5 on one die and a 1 on the other die. The bet pays 15:1 on easy ways (same as a bet on 3 or 11). Hard ways hop pays 30:1 (e.g., 3 and 3 on the hop, same as a bet on 2 or 12).  The true odds are 17:1 and 35:1, resulting in a house edge of 11.11% and 13.89% respectively. When presented, hop bets are located at the center of the craps layout with the other proposition bets.  If hop bets are not on the craps layout, they still may be bet on by players but they become the responsibility of the boxman to book the bet. Sometimes players may request to hop a whole number. In this case the money on the bet different combinations. For example, if a player says \"hop the tens\" (6\u20134, 5\u20135, 4\u20136) the player must give the dealer an even number bet so it can be divided among the hard and easy ways. If the player gives $10, $5 would be placed on the easy ways 10 with 15:1 odds and $5 would be placed on the hard way with 30:1 odds. If a player wishes to \"hop the sevens\" there would be three different combinations and six possible ways to roll a 7 (6\u20131, 5\u20132, 4\u20133, 3\u20134, 2\u20135, 1\u20136) therefore the player should bet in multiples of 3 so the bet can be divided among each combination with a 15:1 payout minus the other two bets, otherwise if players does not bet in multiples of 3, they would specific which combination has additional units.\n\nField: This bet is a wager that one of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12 will appear on the next roll of the dice. This bet typically pays more (2:1 or 3:1) if 2 or 12 is rolled, and 1:1 if 3, 4, 9, 10 or 11 is rolled.\nThe Field bet is a \"Self-Service\" Bet. Unlike the other proposition bets which are handled by the dealers or stickman, the field bet is placed directly by the player.\n\nPlayers identify their Field bets by placing them in the Field area directly in front of them or as close to their position as possible. The initial bet and/or any payouts can \"ride\" through several rolls until they lose, and are assumed to be \"riding\" by dealers. It is thus the player's responsibility to collect their bet and/or winnings immediately upon payout, before the next dice roll, if they do not wish to let it ride.\n\n===Player bets===\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}\nFire Bet: A registered trademark owned by [[SHFL entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=2875551&caseType=US_REGISTRATION_NO&searchType=statusSearch |work=USPTO |title=USPTO |publisher=United States Patent & Trademark Office}}</ref> Before the shooter begins, some casinos will allow a bet known as a fire bet to be placed.  A fire bet is a bet of as little as $1 and generally up to a maximum of $5 to $10 sometimes higher, depending on casino, made in the hope that the next shooter will have a hot streak of setting and getting many points of different values. As different individual points are made by the shooter, they will be marked on the craps layout with a fire symbol.\n\nThe first three points will not pay out on the fire bet, but the fourth, fifth and sixth will pay out at increasing odds. The fourth point pays at 24-to-1, the fifth point pays at 249-to-1 and the 6th point pays at 999-to-1. Note that the points must all be different numbers for them to count towards the fire bet. For example, a shooter who successfully hits a point of 10 twice will only garner credit for the first one on the fire bet. Players must hit the established point in order for it to count toward the fire bet. The payout is determine by the number of points which have been established and hit after the shooter sevens out.<ref name=\"Roto2016\">{{cite book|author=Robert R.

For example, a player may be wish to bet $1 on all hard ways and the horn. If one of the bets win the dealer may automatically replenish the losing bet with profits from the winning bet. In this example, if the shooter rolls a hard 8 (pays 9:1), the horn loses. The dealer may return $5 to the player and place the other $4 on the horn bet which lost. If the player does not want the bet replenished, he or she should request any or all bets be taken down.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Working and not working bets===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}\nA working bet is a live bet. Bets may also be on the board, but not in play and therefore not working. Pass line and come bets are always working meaning the chips are in play and the player is therefore wagering live money. Other bets may be working or not working depending whether a point has been established or player's choice. Place and buy bets are working by default when a point is established and not working when the point is off unless the player specifies otherwise. Lay bets are always working even if a point has not been established unless the player requests otherwise. At any time, a player may wish to take any bet or bets out of play. The dealer will put an \"Off\" button on the player's specific bet or bets; this allows the player to keep his chips on the board without a live wager. For example, if a player decides not to wager a place bet mid-roll but wishes to keep the chips on the number, he or she may request the bet be \"not working\" or \"Off\". The chips remain on the table, but the player cannot win from or lose chips which are not working.\n\nThe opposite is also allowed. By default place and buy bets are not working without an established point; a player may wish to wager chips before a point has been established.

The following chart shows the dice combinations needed to roll each number.  The two and twelve are the hardest to roll since only one combination of dice is possible. The game of craps is built around the dice roll of seven, since it is the most easily rolled dice combination.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"background:gray; color:black;\"\n|Dice Roll||Possible Dice Combinations\n|-\n|2||1\u20131\n|-\n|3||1\u20132, 2\u20131\n|-\n|4||1\u20133, 2\u20132, 3\u20131\n|-\n|5||1\u20134, 2\u20133, 3\u20132, 4\u20131\n|-\n|6||1\u20135, 2\u20134, 3\u20133, 4\u20132, 5\u20131\n|- style=\"background:white; color:red\"\n|7||1\u20136, 2\u20135, 3\u20134, 4\u20133, 5\u20132, 6\u20131\n|-\n|8||2\u20136, 3\u20135, 4\u20134, 5\u20133, 6\u20132\n|-\n|9||3\u20136, 4\u20135, 5\u20134, 6\u20133\n|-\n|10||4\u20136, 5\u20135, 6\u20134\n|-\n|11||5\u20136, 6\u20135\n|-\n|12||6\u20136\n|}\n\nViewed another way:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border:darkgrey;\"\n|- \n| style=\"width:30px;\"| +\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"width:185px; background:#80ffff;\"| Die A\n|- \n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#ff8080;\"|Die B\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#80ffff;\"|1\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#80ffff;\"|2\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#80ffff;\"|3\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#80ffff;\"|4\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#80ffff;\"|5\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#80ffff;\"|6\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF8080\" |1||2||3||4||5||6||7\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF8080\" |2||3||4||5||6||7||8\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF8080\" |3||4||5||6||7||8||9\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF8080\" |4||5||6||7||8||9||10\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF8080\" |5||6||7||8||9||10||11\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF8080\" |6||7||8||9||10||11||12\n|}\n\nThe [[expected value]] of all bets is usually negative, such that the average player will always lose money. This is because the house always sets the paid odds to below the actual odds. The only exception is the \"odds\" bet that the player is allowed to make after a point is established on a pass/come don't pass/don't come bet (the odds portion of the bet has a long-term expected value of 0). However, this \"free odds\" bet cannot be made independently, so the expected value of the entire bet, including odds, is still negative.  Since there is no correlation between die rolls, there is normally no possible long-term winning strategy in craps.\n\nThere are occasional promotional variants that provide either no house edge or even a player edge. One example is a field bet that pays 3:1 on 12 and 2:1 on either 3 or 11. Overall, given the 5:4 true odds of this bet, and the weighted average paid odds of approximately 7:5, the player has a 5% advantage on this bet. This is sometimes seen at casinos running limited-time incentives, in jurisdictions or gaming houses that require the game to be fair, or in layouts for use in informal settings using play money. No casino currently runs a craps table with a bet that yields a player edge full-time.\n\nMaximizing the size of the odds bet in relation to the line bet will reduce, but never eliminate the house edge, and will increase [[variance]].  Most casinos have a limit on how large the odds bet can be in relation to the line bet, with single, double, and five times odds common.  Some casinos offer 3\u20134\u20135 odds, referring to the maximum multiple of the line bet a player can place in odds for the points of 4 and 10, 5 and 9, and 6 and 8, respectively.  During promotional periods, a casino may even offer 100x odds bets, which reduces the house edge to almost nothing, but dramatically increases variance, as the player will be betting in large betting units.\n\nSince several of the multiple roll bets pay off in ratios of fractions on the dollar, it is important that the player bets in multiples that will allow a correct payoff in complete dollars. Normally, payoffs will be rounded down to the nearest dollar, resulting in a higher house advantage. These bets include all place bets, taking odds, and buying on numbers 6, 8, 5, and 9, as well as laying all numbers.\n\n== Betting variants ==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}\nThese variants depend on the casino and the table, and sometimes a casino will have different tables that use or omit these variants and others.\n\n* 11 is a point number instead of a natural. Rolling an 11 still pays \"Yo\" center-table bets, but the Pass line does not automatically win (and the Don't Pass line doesn't automatically lose) when 11 is rolled on the come-out. Making the point pays 3:1 on Pass/Come odds bets (1:3 on Don't Pass/Come odds); all line bets are still even money. This substantially reduces the odds of a natural (from 8/36 to 6/36) and of making the point in general (since you're adding a 3:1 dog to the mix). All other things equal, the house edge on the Pass Line and Come bets for this play variation jumps dramatically to 9.75%.\n* 12 pays 3:1 on the field. This is generally seen in rooms that have two different table minimums, on the tables with the higher minimums. The lower minimum ones will then have 2:1 odds.  For example, the Mirage casino in Las Vegas features 3:1 odds.\n* 11 pays 2:1 on the field. This variant is normally used when 12 pays 3:1, and neutralizes the house edge on the field.\n* Big 6/8 are unavailable. These bets are equivalent to placing or buying 6 or 8 as points, which have better payout for the same real odds, so Big 6/8 are rarely used and many casinos simply omit them from the layout. Casinos in Atlantic City are even prohibited by law from offering Big 6/8 bets.\n\n==Optimal betting==\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}\nWhen craps is played in a casino, all bets have a house advantage. That is, it can be shown mathematically that a player will (with 100% probability) lose all his or her money to the casino in the long run, while in the short run the player is more likely to lose money than make money. There may be players who are lucky and get ahead for a period of time, but in the long run these winning streaks are eroded away. One can slow, but not eliminate, one's average losses by only placing bets with the smallest house advantage.\n\nThe pass/don't pass line, come/don't come line, place 6, place 8, buy 4 and buy 10 (only under the casino rules where commission is charged only on wins) have the lowest house edge in the casino, and all other bets will, on average, lose money between three and twelve times faster because of the difference in house edges.\n\nThe place bets and buy bets differ from the pass line and come line, in that place bets and buy bets can be removed at any time, since, while they are multi-roll bets, their odds of winning do not change from roll to roll,  whereas pass line bets and come line bets are a combination of different odds on their first roll and subsequent rolls. The first roll of a pass line bet is 2:1 advantage for the player (8 wins, 4 losses), but it's \"paid for\" by subsequent rolls that are at the same disadvantage to the player as the don't pass bets were at an advantage. As such, they cannot profitably let you take down the bet after the first roll. Players can bet or lay odds behind an established point depending on whether it was a Pass/Come or Don't Pass/Don't Come to lower house edge by receiving true odds on the point. Casinos which allow put betting allows players to increase or make new pass/come bets after the come-out roll. This bet generally has a higher house edge than place betting, unless the casino offers high odds.\n\nConversely, you can take back (pick up) a don't pass or don't come bet after the first roll, but this cannot be recommended, because you already endured the disadvantaged part of the combination \u2013 the first roll. On that come-out roll, you win just 3 times (2 and 3), while losing 8 of them (7 and 11) and pushing once (12) out of the 36 possible rolls. On the other 24 rolls that become a point, your don't pass bet is now to your advantage by 6:3 (4 and 10), 6:4 (5 and 9) and 6:5 (6 and 8). If a player chooses to remove the initial don't come and/or don't pass line bet, he or she can no longer lay odds behind the bet and cannot re-bet the same don't pass and/or don't come number (players must make a new don't pass or come bets if desired). However, players can still make standard lay bets odds on any of the point numbers (4,5,6,8,9,10).\n\nAmong these, and the remaining numbers and possible bets, there are a myriad of systems and progressions that can be used with many combinations of numbers.\n\nAn important alternative metric is house advantage per roll (rather than per bet), which may be expressed in loss per hour.<ref name=\"wizardofodds.com\">{{cite web|url=http://wizardofodds.com/craps |title=Craps |publisher=Wizard of Odds |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2012-06-30}}</ref> The typical pace of rolls varies depending on the number of players, but 102 rolls per hour is a cited rate for a nearly full table.<ref name=\"wizardofodds.com\"/> This same reference states that only \"29.6% of total rolls are come out rolls, on average\", so for this alternative metric, needing extra rolls to resolve the pass line bet, for example, is factored.

If a player wishes to change shooting hands, they may set the dice on the table, let go, then take them with the other hand.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cassaon-casino.com/craps/etiquette.php|title=Craps Etiquette, Social Rules at the Craps Table|work=Cassaon-casino|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://alanbestbuys.com/id422.html|title=Dice Games and Craps Etiquette|website=alanbestbuys.com|access-date=2018-08-19}}</ref>\n\nWhen throwing the dice, the player is expected to hit the farthest wall at the opposite end of the table (these walls are typically augmented with pyramidal structures to ensure highly unpredictable bouncing after impact). Casinos will sometimes allow a roll that does not hit the opposite wall as long as the dice are thrown past the middle of the table; a very short roll will be nullified as a \"no roll\". The dice may not be slid across the table and must be tossed.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.clearwatercasino.com/how-to-play-craps-part-2/|title=How To Play Craps, Part 2 {{!}} Suquamish Clearwater Casino Resort|date=2012-08-28|work=Suquamish Clearwater Casino Resort|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US}}</ref> These rules are intended to prevent dexterous players from [[Dice control|physically influencing the outcome of the roll]].\n\nPlayers are generally asked not to throw the dice above a certain height (such as the eye level of the dealers). This is both for the safety of those around the table, and to eliminate the potential use of such a throw as a distraction device in order to cheat.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDice are still considered \"in play\" if they land on players' bets on the table, the dealer's working stacks, on the marker puck, or with one die resting on top of the other. The roll is invalid if either or both dice land in the boxman's bank, the stickman's bowl (where the extra three dice are kept between rolls), or in the rails around the top of the table where players chips are kept. If one or both dice hits a player or dealer and rolls back onto the table, the roll counts as long as the person being hit did not intentionally interfere with either of the dice, though some casinos will rule \"no roll\" for this situation. If one or both leave the table, it is also a \"no roll\", and the dice may either be replaced or examined by the boxman and returned to play.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nShooters may wish to \"set\" the dice to a particular starting configuration before throwing (such as showing a particular number or combination, stacking the dice, or spacing them to be picked up between different fingers), but if they do, they are often asked to be quick about it so as not to delay the game. Some casinos disallow such rituals to speed up the pace of the game.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.crapspit.org/dice-control-scam/|title=The Dice Control Scam: Don\u2019t Fall for It!|date=2014-03-25|work=CrapsPit.org|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US}}</ref> Some may also discourage or disallow unsanitary practices such as kissing or spitting on the dice.\n\nIn most casinos, players are not allowed to hand anything directly to dealers, and vice versa. Items such as cash, checks, and chips are exchanged by laying them down on the table; for example, when \"buying in\" (paying cash for chips), players are expected to place the cash on the layout: the dealer will take it and then place the chips in front of the player. This rule is enforced in order to allow the casino to easily monitor and record all transfers via overhead surveillance cameras, and to reduce the opportunity for cheating via sleight-of-hand.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://gamboool.com/craps-etiquette-at-the-casino-unwritten-rules-for-beginners-wanting-to-fit-in-at-the-tables|title=Craps Etiquette at the Casino \u2013 Unwritten Rules for Beginners Wanting to Fit In at the Tables|date=2018-03-09|work=Gamboool!|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMost casinos prohibit \"call bets\", and may have a warning such as \"No Call Bets\" printed on the layout to make this clear. This means a player may not call out a bet without also placing the corresponding chips on the table. Such a rule reduces the potential for misunderstanding in loud environments, as well as disputes over the amount that the player intended to bet after the outcome has been decided. Some casinos choose to allow call bets once players have bought-in. When allowed, they are usually made when a player wishes to bet at the last second, immediately before the dice are thrown, to avoid the risk of obstructing the roll.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Etiquette ==\nCraps is among the most social and most superstitious of all gambling games, which leads to an enormous variety of informal rules of etiquette that players may be expected to follow.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.poormansguidetocasinogambling.com/blog/proper-craps-etiquette|title=Proper Craps Etiquette|website=Poorman's Guide to Casino Gambling|access-date=2018-08-19}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.crapspit.org/craps-table/proper-etiquette-craps-table/|title=Proper Craps Etiquette at the Craps Table|work=CrapsPit.org|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US}}</ref> An exhaustive list of these is beyond the scope of this article, but the guidelines below are most commonly given.\n\n=== Tips ===\nTipping the dealers is universal and expected in Craps. As in most other casino games, a player may simply place (or toss) chips onto the table and say, \"For the dealers\", \"For the crew\", ''etc.'' In craps, it is also common to place a bet for the dealers. This is usually done one of three ways: by placing an ordinary bet and simply declaring it for the dealers, as a \"two-way\", or \"on top\". A \"Two-Way\" is a bet for both parties: for example, a player may toss in two chips and say \"Two Way Hard Eight\", which will be understood to mean one chip for the player and one chip for the dealers. Players may also place a stack of chips for a bet as usual, but leave the top chip off-center and announce \"on top for the dealers\". The dealer's portion is often called a \"toke\" bet, which comes from the practice of using $1 slot machine tokens to place dealer bets in some casinos.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn some cases, players may also tip each other, for example as a show of gratitude to the thrower for a roll on which they win a substantial bet.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Superstition ===\nCraps players routinely practice a wide range of superstitious behaviors, and may expect or demand these from other players as well.\n\nMost prominently, it is universally considered bad luck to say the word \"seven\" (after the \"come-out\", a roll of 7 is a loss for \"pass\" bets). Dealers themselves often make significant efforts to avoid calling out the number. When necessary, participants may refer to seven with a \"nickname\" such as \"Big Red\" (or just \"Red\"), \"the S-word\", etc.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Systems ==\n\n=== Martingale system ===\n{{Main article|Martingale (betting system)}}\nAlthough no wagering system can consistently beat casino games based on independent trials such as craps, that does not stop gamblers from believing in them. One of the best known systems is the Martingale System. In this strategy, the gambler doubles his bet after every loss. After a win, the bet is reset to the original bet. The theory is that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. The main article on martingale describes the flaws in this system.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Gambler's fallacy ===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}\n{{Main article|Gambler's fallacy}}\nOther systems depend on the gambler's fallacy, which in craps terms is the belief that past dice rolls influence the probabilities of future dice rolls. For example, the gambler's fallacy indicates that a craps player should bet on eleven if an eleven has not appeared or has appeared too often in the last 20 rolls.  In practice this can be observed as players respond to a roll such as a Hard Six with an immediate wager on the Hard Six.\n\nIn reality, each roll of the dice is an [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] event, so the probability of rolling eleven is exactly 1/18 on every roll, regardless of the number of times eleven has come up in the last x rolls. Even if the dice are actually biased toward particular results (\"loaded\"), each roll is still independent of all the previous ones. The common term to describe this is \"dice have no memory\".\n\n===Dice setting or dice control===\n{{Main article|Dice control}}\nAnother approach is to \"set\" the dice in a particular orientation, and then throw them in such a manner that they do not tumble randomly.  The theory is that given exactly the same throw from exactly the same starting configuration, the dice will tumble in the same way and therefore show the same or similar values every time.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nCasinos take steps to prevent this. The dice are usually required to hit the back wall of the table, which is normally faced with an angular texture such as pyramids, making controlled spins more difficult. There has been no independent evidence that such methods can be successfully applied in a real casino.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Variants==\nBank craps is a variation of the original craps game and is sometimes known as Las Vegas Craps. This variant is quite popular in Nevada gambling houses, and its availability online has now made it a globally played game. Bank craps uses a special table layout and all bets must be made against the house. In Bank Craps, the dice are thrown over a wire or a string that is normally stretched a few inches from the table\u2019s surface. The lowest house edge (for the pass/don't pass) in this variation is around 1.4%. Generally, if the word \"craps\" is used without any modifier, it can be inferred to mean this version of the game, to which most of this article refers.<ref name=\"scarne\"/>\n\nCrapless craps, also known as Bastard Craps, is a simple version of the original craps game, and is normally played as an online private game. The biggest difference between crapless craps and original craps, is that the shooter (person throwing the dice) is at a far greater disadvantage and has a house edge of 5.38%. Another difference is that this is one of the craps games in which a player can bet on rolling a 2, 3, 11 or 12 before a 7 is thrown. In crapless craps, 2 and 12 have odds of 11:2 and have a house edge of 7.143% while 3 and 11 have odds of 11:4 with a house edge of 6.25%.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shackleford|first1=Michael|title=Craps Side Bets \u2013 Wizard of Odds|url=https://wizardofodds.com/games/craps/appendix/5/|website=wizardofodds.com|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nNew York Craps is one of the variations of craps played mostly in the Eastern coast of the USA, true to its name. History states that this game was actually found and played in casinos in Yugoslavia, the UK and the Bahamas. In this craps variant, the house edge is greater than Las Vegas Craps or Bank craps. The table layout is also different, and is called a double-end-dealer table. This variation is different from the original craps game in several ways, but the primary difference is that New York craps doesn\u2019t allow Come or Don\u2019t Come bets. New York Craps Players bet on box numbers like 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10. The overall house edge in New York craps is 5%.<ref name=\"scarne\"/>\n\n==Card-based variations==\nIn order to get around California laws barring the payout of a game being directly related to the roll of dice, Indian reservations have adapted the game to substitute cards for dice.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Cards replacing dice===\nIn one variation, there are no dice at all. Two shoes are used, each containing some number of regular card decks that have been stripped down to just the Aces and deuces through sixes. The boxman simply deals one card from each shoe and that is the roll on which bets are settled. Since a card-counting scheme is easily devised to make use of the information of cards that have already been dealt, a relatively small portion (less than 50%) of each shoe is usually dealt in order to protect the house.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn a similar variation, cards representing dice are dealt directly from a continuous [[shuffling machine]] (CSM).  Typically, the CSM will hold approximately 264 cards, or 44 sets of 1 through 6 spot cards.  Two cards are dealt from the CSM for each roll. The game is played exactly as regular craps, but the roll distribution of the remaining cards in the CSM is slightly skewed from the normal symmetric distribution of dice.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nEven if the dealer were to shuffle each roll back into the CSM, the effect of buffering a number of cards in the chute of the CSM provides information about the skew of the next roll.  Analysis shows this type of game is biased towards the don't pass and don't come bets.  A player betting don't pass and don't come every roll and laying 10x odds receives a 2% profit on the initial don't pass / don't come bet each roll.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Using a counting system allows the player to attain a similar return at lower variance.\n\nTo replicate the original dice odds exactly without dice or possibility of card-counting, another scheme uses two shuffle machines with just one deck of Ace through 6 each. Each machine selects one of the 6 cards at random and this is the roll. The selected cards are replaced and the decks are reshuffled for the next roll.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Cards mapping physical dice===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}\nIn this game variation, one red deck and one blue deck of six cards each (A through 6), and a red die and a blue die are used. Each deck is shuffled separately, usually by machine. Each card is then dealt onto the layout, into the 6 red and 6 blue numbered boxes. The shooter then shoots the dice. The red card in the red-numbered box corresponding to the red die, and the blue card in the blue-numbered box corresponding to the blue die are then turned over to form the roll on which bets are settled.\n\nAnother variation uses a red and a blue deck of 36 custom playing cards each. Each card has a picture of a two-die roll on it \u2013 from 1\u20131 to 6\u20136. The shooter shoots what looks like a red and a blue die, called \"cubes\". They are numbered such that they can never throw a pair, and that the blue one will show a higher value than the red one exactly half the time. One such scheme could be 222555 on the red die and 333444 on the blue die.\n\nOne card is dealt from the red deck and one is dealt from the blue deck. The shooter throws the \"cubes\" and the color of the cube that is higher selects the color of the card to be used to settle bets. On one such table, an additional one-roll prop bet was offered: If the card that was turned over for the \"roll\" was either 1\u20131 or 6\u20136, the other card was also turned over. If the other card was the \"opposite\" (6\u20136 or 1\u20131, respectively) of the first card, the bet paid 500:1 for this 647:1 proposition.\n\nAnd additional variation uses a single set of 6 cards, and regular dice. The roll of the dice maps to the card in that position, and if a pair is rolled, then the mapped card is used twice, as a pair.\n\n==Rules of play against other players==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}\nRecreational or informal playing of craps outside of a casino is referred to as street craps or private craps.  The most notable difference between playing street craps and [[bank]] craps is that there is no bank or house to cover bets in street craps.  Players must bet against each other by covering or fading each other's bets for the game to be played. If money is used instead of chips and depending on the laws of where it is being played, street craps can be an illegal form of gambling.\n\nThere are many variations of street craps.  The simplest way is to either agree on or roll a number as the point, then roll the point again before you roll a seven.  Unlike more complex [[proposition bet]]s offered by casinos, street craps has more simplified betting options.  The shooter is required to make either a Pass or a Don't Pass bet if he wants to roll the dice.  Another player must choose to cover the shooter to create a stake for the game to continue.\n\nIf there are several players, the rotation of the player who must cover the shooter may change with the shooter (comparable to a blind in [[poker]]).  The person covering the shooter will always bet against the shooter.  For example, if the shooter made a \"Pass\" bet, the person covering the shooter would make a \"Don't Pass\" bet to win.  Once the shooter is covered, other players may make Pass/Don't Pass bets, or any other proposition bets, as long as there is another player willing to cover.\n\n==In popular culture==\nDue to the random nature of the game, in popular culture \"a crapshoot\" is often used to describe an action with an unpredictable outcome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crapshoot|title=Definition of CRAPSHOOT|author=|date=|work=Merriam-Webster.com|access-date=25 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nA [[Golden Arm]] is a craps player who rolls the dice for longer than one hour without losing.

Clausewitz, [[Hermann von Boyen]] (1771\u20131848) and [[Karl von Grolman]] (1777\u20131843) were among Scharnhorst's primary allies in his efforts to reform the Prussian army between 1807 and 1814.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nClausewitz served during the Jena Campaign as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia|Prince August]].

Like many Prussian officers serving in Russia, he joined the [[Russian-German Legion]] in 1813. In the service of the [[Russian Empire]], Clausewitz helped negotiate the [[Convention of Tauroggen]] (1812), which prepared the way for the coalition of Prussia, Russia, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] that ultimately defeated Napoleon and his allies.<ref name=ClausewitzDotComBio />\n\nIn 1815 the Russian-German Legion became integrated into the Prussian Army and Clausewitz re-entered Prussian service as a colonel. He was soon appointed chief-of-staff of [[Johann von Thielmann]]'s III Corps. In that capacity he served at the [[Battle of Ligny]] and the [[Battle of Wavre]] during the [[Waterloo Campaign]] in 1815. An army led personally by Napoleon defeated the Prussians at [[Ligny]] (south of [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] and the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]]) on 16 June 1815, but Napoleon's failure to destroy the Prussian forces led to his defeat a few days later at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (18 June 1815), when the Prussian forces unexpectedly arrived on his right flank late in the afternoon to support the Anglo-Dutch-Belgian forces pressing his front. Clausewitz's unit fought at [[Battle of Wavre|Wavre]] (18\u201319 June 1815), preventing large reinforcements from reaching Napoleon at Waterloo.  After the war Clausewitz served as the director of the ''[[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]]'', where he served until 1830. In that year he returned to duty with the army. Soon afterwards, the outbreak of several revolutions around Europe and [[November Uprising|a crisis in Poland]] appeared to presage another major European war. Clausewitz was appointed chief of staff of the only army Prussia was able to mobilize in this emergency, which was sent to the Polish border. Its commander, Gneisenau, died of cholera (August 1831), and Clausewitz took command of the Prussian army's efforts to construct a ''cordon sanitaire'' to contain the great [[1829\u201351 cholera pandemic|cholera outbreak]] (the first time cholera had appeared in modern heartland Europe, causing a continent-wide panic).

The result was his principal book, ''[[On War]],'' a major work on the philosophy of war. It was unfinished when Clausewitz died and contains material written at different stages in his intellectual evolution, producing some significant contradictions between different sections. The sequence and precise character of that evolution is a source of much debate, as are exact meaning behind his seemingly contradictory claims (discussions pertinent to the tactical, operational and strategic levels of war are one example). Clausewitz constantly sought to revise the text, particularly between 1827 and his departure on his last field assignments, to include more material on \"people's war\" and forms of war other than high-intensity warfare between states, but relatively little of this material was included in the book.<ref name=smith57 /> Soldiers before this time had written treatises on various military subjects, but none had undertaken a great philosophical examination of war on the scale of those written by Clausewitz and [[Leo Tolstoy]], both of which were inspired by the events of the [[Napoleonic Era]].\n\nClausewitz's work is still studied today, demonstrating its continued relevance. More than sixteen major English-language books that focused specifically on his work were published between 2005 and 2014, whereas his 19th-century rival [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]] faded from influence.  Historian [[Lynn Montross]] said the outcome, \"may be explained by the fact that Jomini produced a system of war, Clausewitz a philosophy.  The one has been outdated by new weapons, the other still influences the strategy behind those weapons.\"<ref>Lynn Montross, ''War Through the Ages'' (2nd ed. 1946) p. 583.</ref>  Jomini did not attempt to define war. Clausewitz did, providing (and dialectically comparing) a number of definitions. The first is his dialectical thesis: \"War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.\" The second, often treated as Clausewitz's 'bottom line,' is in fact merely his dialectical antithesis: \"War is merely the continuation of policy by other means.\" The synthesis of his dialectical examination of the nature of war is his famous \"trinity,\" saying that war is \"a fascinating trinity\u2014composed of primordial violence, hatred, and enmity, which are to be regarded as a blind natural force; the play of chance and probability, within which the creative spirit is free to roam; and its element of subordination, as an instrument of policy, which makes it subject to pure reason.\"<ref>Carl von Clausewitz, ''On War'', originally ''Vom Kriege'' (3 vols., Berlin: 1832\u201334).

He relied on his own experiences, contemporary writings about Napoleon, and on deep historical research. His historiographical approach is evident in his first extended study, written when he was 25, of the [[Thirty Years War]]. He rejects the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s view of the war as a chaotic muddle and instead explains its drawn-out operations by the [[economy]] and [[technology]] of the age, the social characteristics of the troops, and the commanders' politics and psychology. In ''On War'', Clausewitz sees all wars as the sum of decisions, actions, and reactions in an uncertain and dangerous context, and also as a socio-political phenomenon. He also stressed the complex nature of war, which encompasses both the socio-political and the operational and stresses the primacy of state policy.<ref name=Paret>Paret, ''Clausewitz and the State: The Man, His Theories, and His Times''</ref>{{rp|viii}}\n\nThe word \"[[strategy]]\" had only recently come into usage in modern Europe, and Clausewitz's definition is quite narrow: \"the use of engagements for the object of war.\" Clausewitz conceived of war as a political, social, and military phenomenon which might \u2014 depending on circumstances \u2014 involve the entire population of a nation at war. In any case, Clausewitz saw military force as an instrument that states and other political actors use to pursue the ends of policy, in a dialectic between opposing wills, each with the aim of imposing his policies and will upon his enemy.<ref>{{cite book|first=Beatrice |last=Heuser |chapter=Clausewitz\u2019 Ideas of Strategy and Victory |editor1-first=Hew |editor1-last=Strachan |editor2-first=Andreas |editor2-last=Herberg-Rothe |title=Clausewitz in the 21st Century|script-title=Proceedings of a March, 2005 conference at Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |pages=132\u2013163}}</ref>\n\nClausewitz's emphasis on the inherent superiority of the defense suggests that habitual aggressors are likely to end up as failures. The inherent superiority of the defense obviously does not mean that the defender will always win, however: there are other asymmetries to be considered. He was interested in cooperation between the regular army and militia or partisan forces, or citizen soldiers, as one possible \u2014 sometimes the only \u2014 method of defense. In the circumstances of the Wars of the French Revolution and with Napoleon, which were energized by a rising spirit of nationalism, he emphasized the need for states to involve their entire populations in the conduct of war. This point is especially important, as these wars demonstrated that such energies could be of decisive importance and for a time led to a democratization of the armed forces much as universal suffrage democratized politics.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael I. Handel|title=Clausewitz and Modern Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4A6fCuHGWhcC&pg=PA71|year=1986|publisher=Psychology Press|page=71|isbn=9780714632940}}</ref>\n\nWhile Clausewitz was intensely aware of the value of intelligence at all levels, he was also very skeptical of the accuracy of much military intelligence: \"Many intelligence reports in war are contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain.... In short, most intelligence is false.\"<ref name=OnWar1873 />{{rp|Vol. I pg. 38}} This circumstance is generally described as part of the [[fog of war]]. Such skeptical comments apply only to intelligence at the tactical and operational levels; at the strategic and political levels he constantly stressed the requirement for the best possible understanding of what today would be called strategic and political intelligence. His conclusions were influenced by his experiences in the Prussian Army, which was often in an intelligence fog due partly to the superior abilities of Napoleon's system but even more to the nature of war.  Clausewitz acknowledges that friction creates enormous difficulties for the realization of any plan, and the ''fog of war'' hinders commanders from knowing what is happening. It is precisely in the context of this challenge that he develops the concept of military genius, whose capabilities are seen above all in the execution of operations. 'Military genius' is not simply a matter of intellect, but a combination of qualities of intellect, experience, personality, and temperament (and there are many possible such combinations) that create a very highly developed mental aptitude for the waging of war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frederick L.

British military theorist [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] contends that the enthusiastic acceptance by the [[Prussia]]n military establishment \u2013 especially [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Moltke the Elder]], a former student of his <ref>{{cite book |page=35 \n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bI5CAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA35 |title=Moltke: His Life and His Character |script-title=Sketched in Journals, Letters, Memoirs, a Novel, and Autobiographical Notes |translator-first=Mary |translator-last=Herms |publisher=Harper & Brothers Franklin Square |location=New York |year=1892 |last=Moltke |first=Helmuth\n}}</ref> \u2013 of what they believed to be Clausewitz's ideas, and the subsequent widespread adoption of the Prussian military system worldwide, had a deleterious effect on [[military theory]] and [[warfare|practice]], due to their egregious misinterpretation of his ideas:\n\n<blockquote>As so often happens, Clausewitz's disciples carried his teaching to an extreme which their master had not intended.... [Clausewitz's] theory of war was expounded in a way too abstract and involved for ordinary soldier-minds, essentially concrete, to follow the course of his argument \u2013 which often turned back from the direction in which it was apparently leading.  Impressed yet befogged, they grasped at his vivid leading phrases, seeing only their surface meaning, and missing the deeper current of his thought.<ref>[[B. H. Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart, B. H.]] ''Strategy'' London:Faber, 1967. Second rev. ed.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs described by [[Christopher Bassford]], then-professor of strategy at the [[National War College]] of the United States:\n\n<blockquote>One of the main sources of confusion about Clausewitz's approach lies in his dialectical method of presentation. For example, Clausewitz's famous line that \"War is a mere continuation of politics by other means,\" (\"Der Krieg ist eine blo\u00dfe Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln\") while accurate as far as it goes, was not intended as a statement of fact. It is the antithesis in a dialectical argument whose thesis is the point \u2013 made earlier in the analysis \u2013 that \"war is nothing but a duel [or wrestling match, a better translation of the German ''Zweikampf''] on a larger scale.\" His synthesis, which resolves the deficiencies of these two bold statements, says that war is neither \"nothing but\" an act of brute force nor \"merely\" a rational act of politics or policy. This synthesis lies in his \"fascinating trinity\" [wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit]: a dynamic, inherently unstable interaction of the forces of violent emotion, chance, and rational calculation.<ref name=ClausewitzDotComBio /></blockquote>\n\nAnother example of this confusion is the idea that Clausewitz was a proponent of [[total war]] as used in the Third Reich's propaganda in the 1940s. In fact, he never used the term \"total war\": rather, he discussed \"absolute war\" or \"ideal war\" as the purely ''logical'' result of the forces underlying a \"pure,\" Platonic \"ideal\" of war. In what he called a \"logical fantasy,\" war cannot be waged in a limited way: the rules of competition will force participants to use all means at their disposal to achieve victory. But in the ''real world'', he said, such rigid logic is unrealistic and dangerous. As a practical matter, the military objectives in ''real'' war that support political objectives generally fall into two broad types: \"war to achieve limited aims\"; and war to \"disarm\" the enemy, \"to render [him] politically helpless or militarily impotent.\" Thus the complete defeat of the enemy may not be necessary, desirable, or even possible.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hal Brands|author2=Jeremi Suri|title=The Power of the Past: History and Statecraft|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D03DCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA147|date= 2015|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|page=147|isbn=9780815727132}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times the reconstruction of Clausewitzian theory has been a matter of much dispute. One analysis was that of [[Panagiotis Kondylis]], a Greek-German writer and philosopher, who opposed the interpretations of [[Raymond Aron]] in ''Penser la Guerre, Clausewitz'', and other liberal writers. According to Aron, Clausewitz was one of the first writers to condemn the militarism of the Prussian general staff and its war-proneness, based on Clausewitz's argument that \"war is a continuation of politics by other means.\" In ''Theory of War,'' Kondylis claims that this is inconsistent with Clausewitzian thought. He claims that Clausewitz was morally indifferent to war (though this probably reflects a lack of familiarity with personal letters from Clausewitz, which demonstrate an acute awareness of war's tragic aspects) and that his advice regarding politics' dominance over the conduct of war has nothing to do with pacifist ideas. For Clausewitz, war is simply one unique means that is sometimes applied to the eternal quest for power, of ''raison d'\u00c9tat'' in an anarchic and unsafe world.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOther notable writers who have studied Clausewitz's texts and translated them into English are historians [[Peter Paret]] of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and [[Michael Howard (historian)|Sir Michael Howard]], and the philosopher, musician, and [[game theory|game theorist]] [[Anatol Rapoport]]. Howard and Paret edited the most widely used edition of ''On War'' (Princeton University Press, 1976/1984) and have produced comparative studies of Clausewitz and other theorists, such as Tolstoy. [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]]'s ''A Guide to the Reading of \"On War\"'', in the 1976 Princeton translation, expressed his interpretations of the Prussian's theories and provided students with an influential synopsis of this vital work.\n\nThe British military historian [[John Keegan]] attacked Clausewitz's theory in his book ''[[A History of Warfare]]''.<ref>John Keegan, ''[[A History of Warfare]]''. 1993. Second edition 2004, p. 3.</ref> Keegan argued that Clausewitz assumed the existence of states, yet 'war antedates the state, diplomacy and strategy by many millennia.'\n\n==Influence==\nClausewitz died without completing ''On War'', but despite this his ideas have been widely influential in [[military theory]] and have had a strong influence on German military thought specifically. Later Prussian and German generals, such as [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth Graf von Moltke]], were clearly influenced by Clausewitz: Moltke's widely quoted statement that \"No campaign plan survives first contact with the enemy\" is a classic reflection of Clausewitz's insistence on the roles of chance, friction, \"fog,\" uncertainty, and interactivity in war.<ref name=ClausewitzInEnglish>{{cite book|author=Christopher Bassford|title=Clausewitz in English: The Reception of Clausewitz in Britain and America, 1815\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmCpdoajce0C&pg=PA20|year=1994|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=20\u201321|isbn=9780195083835}}</ref>{{rp|20\u201321}}\n\nClausewitz's influence spread to British thinking as well, though at first more as a historian and analyst than as a theorist.<ref name=ClausewitzInEnglish /> See for example [http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/six.htm Wellington's extended essay] discussing Clausewitz's study of the [http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm Campaign of 1815]\u2014Wellington's only serious written discussion of the battle, which was widely discussed in 19th-century Britain. Clausewitz's broader thinking came to the fore following Britain's military embarrassments in the Boer War (1899\u20131902). One example of a heavy Clausewitzian influence in that era is [[Spenser Wilkinson]], journalist, the first [[Chichele Professor of Military History]] at Oxford University, and perhaps the most prominent military analyst in Britain from c. 1885 until well into the interwar period. Another is naval historian [[Julian Corbett]] (1854\u20131922), whose work reflected a deep if idiosyncratic adherence to Clausewitz's concepts and frequently an emphasis on Clausewitz's ideas about 'limited war' and the inherent strengths of the defensive form of war. Corbett's practical strategic views were often in prominent public conflict with Wilkinson's \u2013 see, for example, Wilkinson's article \"[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/Wilkinson/StrategyAtSea.htm Strategy at Sea],\" ''The Morning Post'', 12 February 1912. Following the First World War, however, the influential British military commentator [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] in the 1920s erroneously attributed to him the doctrine of \"total war\" that during the First World War had been embraced by many European general staffs and emulated by the British. More recent scholars typically see that war as so confused in terms of political rationale that it in fact contradicts much of ''On War.''<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Strachan | first1 = Hew | year = 2011 | title = Clausewitz and the First World War | url = | journal = Journal of Military History | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 367\u201391 }}</ref> One of the most influential British Clausewitzians today is [[Colin S.

Thus the entire history of philosophy appears in Lenin's writings as a vast struggle between \"idealism\" and \"materialism\".

Eisenhower was greatly impressed by Clausewitz\u2019s example of a theoretical, idealized \u201cabsolute war\u201d in ''Vom Krieg'' as a way of demonstrating how absurd it would be to attempt such a strategy in practice. For Eisenhower, the age of nuclear weapons had made what was for Clausewitz in the early 19th century only a theoretical vision an all too real possibility in the mid-20th century. From Eisenhower's viewpoint, the best deterrent to war was to show the world just how appalling and horrific a nuclear \u201cabsolute war\u201d would be if it should ever occur, hence a series of much publicized nuclear tests in the Pacific, giving first priority in the defense budget to nuclear weapons and delivery systems over conventional weapons, and making repeated statements in public that the United States was able and willing at all times to use nuclear weapons. In this way through the [[Massive retaliation]] doctrine and the closely related foreign policy concept of [[Brinkmanship]], Eisenhower hoped to hold out a creditable vision of Clausewitzian nuclear \u201cabsolute war\u201d in order to deter the Soviet Union and/or China from ever risking a war or even conditions that might lead to a war with the United States.<ref>Gaddis, John Lewis \"We Now Know'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997, 1998 pp. 233\u2013234.</ref>\n\n{{Cquote|'''...Philanthropists may easily imagine there is a skilful method of disarming and overcoming an enemy without causing great bloodshed, and that this is the proper tendency of the art of War.

In his book ''The Transformation of War'',<ref>Martin van Creveld, ''The Transformation of War: The Most Radical Reinterpretation of Armed Conflict Since Clausewitz'' (New York: The Free Press, 1991).</ref> Creveld argued that Clausewitz's famous \"Trinity\" of people, army, and government was an obsolete socio-political construct based on the state, which was rapidly passing from the scene as the key player in war, and that he (Creveld) had constructed a new \"non-trinitarian\" model for modern warfare. Creveld's work has had great influence. Daniel Moran replied, 'The most egregious misrepresentation of Clausewitz's famous metaphor must be that of Martin van Creveld, who has declared Clausewitz to be an apostle of Trinitarian War, by which he means, incomprehensibly, a war of 'state against state and army against army,' from which the influence of the people is entirely excluded.\"<ref>Daniel Moran, \"Clausewitz on Waterloo: Napoleon at Bay,\" in Carl von Clausewitz and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, ''On Waterloo: Clausewitz, Wellington, and the Campaign of 1815'', ed./trans. Christopher Bassford, Daniel Moran, and Gregory W. Pedlow (Clausewitz.com, 2010), p.242, n.11.</ref> Christopher Bassford went further, noting that one need only ''read'' the paragraph in which Clausewitz defined his Trinity to see \"that the words 'people,' 'army,' and 'government' appear nowhere at all in the list of the Trinity\u2019s components.... Creveld's and Keegan's assault on Clausewitz's Trinity is not only a classic 'blow into the air,' i.e., an assault on a position Clausewitz doesn't occupy. It is also a pointless attack on a concept that is quite useful in its own right. In any case, their failure to read the actual wording of the theory they so vociferously attack, and to grasp its deep relevance to the phenomena they describe, is hard to credit.\"<ref name=TipToe />\n\nSome have gone further and suggested that Clausewitz's best-known aphorism, that war is a continuation of policy by other means, is not only irrelevant today but also inapplicable historically.<ref>See for instance John Keegan, ''A History of Warfare'' (New York: Knopf, 1993), ''passim''.</ref> For an opposing view see the sixteen essays presented in ''Clausewitz in the Twenty-First Century'' edited by [[Hew Strachan]] and Andreas Herberg-Rothe.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Hew |editor1-last=Strachan |editor2-first=Andreas |editor2-last=Herberg-Rothe |title=Clausewitz in the Twenty-First Century |script-title=Proceedings of a March, 2005 conference at Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn military academies, schools, and universities worldwide, Clausewitz's literature is often mandatory reading.<ref>Giuseppe Caforio, ''Social sciences and the military: an interdisciplinary overview'' (2006) p. 221</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n'''Literature'''\n* 1945: In the [[Horatio Hornblower]] novel ''[[The Commodore]]'', by [[C.

Hemry]], Clausewitz is often quoted by Private Mendoza and his father Lieutenant Mendoza to explain events that unfold during the series.\n* 2004: [[Bob Dylan]] mentions Clausewitz on pages 41 and 45 of his ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'', saying he had \"a morbid fascination with this stuff,\" that \"Clausewitz in some ways is a prophet\" and reading Clausewitz can make you \"take your own thoughts a little less seriously.\" Dylan says that ''Vom Kriege'' was one of the books he looked through among those he found in his friend's personal library as a young man playing at [[The Gaslight Cafe]] in [[Greenwich Village]].\n\n'''Film'''\n* 1962: In ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', General [[Edmund Allenby|Allenby]] ([[Jack Hawkins]]) contends to [[T.

Schnurrbart, in which they refer to German philosophers and their views on war. Schnurrbart: \"Clausewitz said, 'war is a continuation of state policy by other means.'\" \"Yes,\" Steiner says, overlooking the trenches, \" ...by other means.\"\n* 1978: In the [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk|East German Television]] television series ''Scharnhorst'' Clausewitz was played by Bodo Wolf.\n* 1980: East German Television produced a [[television film|television]] [[biopic]], ''Clausewitz \u2013 Lebensbild eines preu\u00dfischen Generals'' (''Clausewitz \u2013 Life picture of a Prussian General''), with J\u00fcrgen Reuter as Clausewitz, directed by Wolf-Dieter Panse.

By the early 1980s several groups were already at work on diverse successors to MacLisp: [[Lisp Machine Lisp]] (aka ZetaLisp), [[Spice Lisp]], [[NIL (programming language)|NIL]] and [[S-1 Lisp]]. Common Lisp sought to unify, standardise, and extend the features of these MacLisp dialects. Common Lisp is not an implementation, but rather a language [[specification]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/01_ab.htm|title=CLHS: Section 1.1.2|author=|date=|website=www.lispworks.com}}</ref> Several [[#Implementations|implementations]] of the Common Lisp standard are available, including [[free and open-source software]] and proprietary products.<ref>[http://common-lisp.net/~dlw/LispSurvey.html Common Lisp Implementations: A Survey]</ref>\nCommon Lisp is a general-purpose, [[multi-paradigm programming language]]. It supports a combination of [[procedural programming|procedural]], [[functional programming|functional]], and [[object-oriented programming]] paradigms. As a [[dynamic programming language]], it facilitates evolutionary and [[Iterative and incremental development|incremental software development]], with iterative [[Compiler|compilation]] into efficient run-time programs. This incremental development is often done interactively without interrupting the running application.\n\nIt also supports optional type annotation and casting, which can be added as necessary at the later profiling and optimization stages, to permit the compiler to generate more efficient code. For instance, <code>fixnum</code> can hold an [[Boxing (computer science)|unboxed]] integer in a range supported by the hardware and implementation, permitting more efficient arithmetic than on big integers or arbitrary precision types.  Similarly, the compiler can be told on a per-module or per-function basis which type safety level is wanted, using ''optimize'' declarations.\n\nCommon Lisp includes [[Common Lisp Object System|CLOS]], an [[object system]] that supports [[multimethods]] and method combinations. It is often implemented with a [[Metaobject]] Protocol.\n\nCommon Lisp is extensible through standard features such as ''Lisp [[Macro (computer science)|macros]]'' (code transformations) and ''reader macros'' (input parsers for characters).\n\nCommon Lisp provides some backwards compatibility to [[Maclisp]] and to John McCarthy's original [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]. This allows older Lisp software to be ported to Common Lisp.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.informatimago.com/develop/lisp/com/informatimago/small-cl-pgms/wang.html\n | title = Old LISP programs still run in Common Lisp | accessdate = 2015-05-13\n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nWork on Common Lisp started in 1981 after an initiative by ARPA manager Bob Engelmore to develop a single community standard Lisp dialect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/doc/history/cl.txt|title=Roots of \"Yu-Shiang Lisp\", Mail from Jon L White, 1982|author=|date=|website=cmu.edu}}</ref> Much of the initial language design was done via electronic mail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cl-su-ai.lisp.se/maillist.html|title=Mail Index|author=|date=|website=cl-su-ai.lisp.se}}</ref><ref>[http://ccs.mit.edu/papers/CCSWP150.html Knee-jerk Anti-LOOPism and other E-mail Phenomena: Oral, Written, and Electronic Patterns in Computer-Mediated Communication, JoAnne Yates and Wanda J.

A second edition, published in 1990, incorporated many changes to the language, made during the ANSI Common Lisp standardization process. The final ANSI Common Lisp standard then was published in 1994. Since then no update to the standard has been published. Various extensions and improvements to Common Lisp (examples are Unicode, Concurrency, CLOS-based IO) have been provided by implementations and libraries (many available via [[Quicklisp]]).\n\n{{Lisp}}\n\n==Syntax==\n\nCommon Lisp is a dialect of Lisp. It uses [[S-expression]]s to denote both code and data structure. Function calls, macro forms and special forms are written as lists, with the name of the operator first, as in these examples:\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (+ 2 2)           ; adds 2 and 2, yielding 4. The function's name is '+'. Lisp has no operators as such.\n</source>\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (defvar *x*)      ; Ensures that a variable *x* exists,\n                   ; without giving it a value. The asterisks are part of\n                   ; the name, by convention denoting a special (global) variable. \n                   ; The symbol *x* is also hereby endowed with the property that\n                   ; subsequent bindings of it are dynamic, rather than lexical.\n (setf *x* 42.1)   ; Sets the variable *x* to the floating-point value 42.1\n</source>\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n ;; Define a function that squares a number:\n (defun square (x)\n   (* x x))\n</source>\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n ;; Execute the function:\n (square 3)        ; Returns 9\n</source>\n<!--                  I truncated this a bit; in smaller browsers, it runs off the side-->\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n ;; The 'let' construct creates a scope for local variables. Here\n ;; the variable 'a' is bound to 6 and the variable 'b' is bound\n ;; to 4. Inside the 'let' is a 'body', where the last computed value is returned.\n ;; Here the result of adding a and b is returned from the 'let' expression.\n ;; The variables a and b have lexical scope, unless the symbols have been\n ;; marked as special variables (for instance by a prior DEFVAR).\n (let ((a 6)\n       (b 4))\n   (+ a b))        ; returns 10\n</source>\n\n==Data types==\nCommon Lisp has many [[data type]]s.\n\n===Scalar types===\n''Number'' types include [[integer]]s, [[ratio]]s, [[Floating point|floating-point number]]s, and [[complex number]]s.<ref name=\"reddy\">{{cite web\n | url = http://random-state.net/features-of-common-lisp.html\n | title = Features of Common Lisp\n | first = Abhishek | last = Reddy\n | date = 2008-08-22\n}}</ref> Common Lisp uses [[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic|bignum]]s to represent numerical values of arbitrary size and precision. The ratio type represents fractions exactly, a facility not available in many languages. Common Lisp automatically coerces numeric values among these types as appropriate.\n\nThe Common Lisp ''[[character (computing)|character]]'' type is not limited to [[ASCII]] characters. Most modern implementations allow [[Unicode]] characters.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.cliki.net/Unicode%20Support\n | title = Unicode support | work = The Common Lisp Wiki | accessdate = 2008-08-21\n}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Symbol (programming)|symbol]]'' type is common to Lisp languages, but largely unknown outside them. A symbol is a unique, named data object with several parts: name, value, function, property list and package. Of these, ''value cell'' and ''function cell'' are the most important. Symbols in Lisp are often used similarly to identifiers in other languages: to hold the value of a variable; however there are many other uses. Normally, when a symbol is evaluated, its value is returned. Some symbols evaluate to themselves, for example all symbols in the keyword package are self-evaluating. Boolean values in Common Lisp are represented by the self-evaluating symbols T and NIL. Common Lisp has namespaces for symbols, called 'packages'.\n\nA number of functions are available for [[rounding]] scalar numeric values in various ways. The function <code>round</code> rounds the argument to the nearest integer, with halfway cases rounded to the even integer. The functions <code>truncate</code>, <code>floor</code>, and <code>ceiling</code> round towards zero, down, or up respectively.  All these functions return the discarded fractional part as a secondary value. For example, <code>(floor -2.5)</code> yields -3, 0.5; <code>(ceiling -2.5)</code>  yields -2, -0.5; <code>(round 2.5)</code> yields 2, 0.5; and <code>(round 3.5)</code> yields 4, -0.5.\n\n===Data structures===\n''Sequence'' types in Common Lisp include lists, vectors, bit-vectors, and strings. There are many operations that can work on any sequence type.\n\nAs in almost all other Lisp dialects, ''lists'' in Common Lisp are composed of ''conses'', sometimes called ''cons cells'' or ''pairs''. A cons is a data structure with two slots, called its ''car'' and ''cdr''. A list is a linked chain of conses or the empty list. Each cons's car refers to a member of the list (possibly another list). Each cons's cdr refers to the next cons\u2014except for the last cons in a list, whose cdr refers to the <code>nil</code> value. Conses can also easily be used to implement trees and other complex data structures; though it is usually advised to use structure or class instances instead. It is also possible to create circular data structures with conses.\n\nCommon Lisp supports multidimensional ''arrays'', and can dynamically resize ''adjustable'' arrays if required. Multidimensional arrays can be used for matrix mathematics. A ''vector'' is a one-dimensional array. Arrays can carry any type as members (even mixed types in the same array) or can be specialized to contain a specific type of members, as in a vector of bits. Usually only a few types are supported. Many implementations can optimize array functions when the array used is type-specialized. Two type-specialized array types are standard: a ''string'' is a vector of characters, while a ''bit-vector'' is a vector of [[bit]]s.\n\n''[[Hash table]]s'' store associations between data objects. Any object may be used as key or value. Hash tables are automatically resized as needed.\n\n''Packages'' are collections of symbols, used chiefly to separate the parts of a program into [[namespaces]]. A package may ''export'' some symbols, marking them as part of a public interface. Packages can use other packages.\n\n''Structures'', similar in use to [[C (programming language)|C]] structs and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] records, represent arbitrary complex data structures with any number and type of fields (called ''slots''). Structures allow single-inheritance.\n\n''Classes'' are similar to structures, but offer more dynamic features and multiple-inheritance. (See [[Common Lisp Object System|CLOS]]). Classes have been added late to Common Lisp and there is some conceptual overlap with structures. Objects created of classes are called ''Instances''. A special case are Generic Functions. Generic Functions are both functions and instances.\n\n===Functions===\nCommon Lisp supports [[first-class function]]s.  For instance, it is possible to write functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as well.  This makes it possible to describe very general operations.\n\nThe Common Lisp library relies heavily on such higher-order functions. For example, the <code>sort</code> function takes a [[relational operator]] as an argument and key function as an optional keyword argument. This can be used not only to sort any type of data, but also to sort data structures according to a key.\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n ;; Sorts the list using the > and < function as the relational operator.\n (sort (list 5 2 6 3 1 4) #'>)   ; Returns (6 5 4 3 2 1)\n (sort (list 5 2 6 3 1 4) #'<)   ; Returns (1 2 3 4 5 6)\n</source>\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n ;; Sorts the list according to the first element of each sub-list.\n (sort (list '(9 A) '(3 B) '(4 C)) #'< :key #'first)   ; Returns ((3 B) (4 C) (9 A))\n</source>\n\nThe evaluation model for functions is very simple.  When the evaluator encounters a form <code>(f a1 a2...)</code> then it presumes that the symbol named f is one of the following:\n\n# A special operator (easily checked against a fixed list)\n# A macro operator (must have been defined previously)\n# The name of a function (default), which may either be a symbol, or a sub-form beginning with the symbol <code>lambda</code>.\n\nIf f is the name of a function, then the arguments a1, a2, ..., an are evaluated in left-to-right order, and the function is found and invoked with those values supplied as parameters.\n\n====Defining functions====\nThe [[Defun|macro <code>defun</code>]] defines functions where a function definition gives the name of the function, the names of any arguments, and a function body:\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (defun square (x)\n   (* x x))\n</source>\n\nFunction definitions may include compiler [[Directive (programming)|directives]], known as ''declarations'', which provide hints to the compiler about optimization settings or the data types of arguments. They may also include ''documentation strings'' (docstrings), which the Lisp system may use to provide interactive documentation:\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (defun square (x)\n   \"Calculates the square of the single-float x.\"\n   (declare (single-float x) (optimize (speed 3) (debug 0) (safety 1)))\n   (the single-float (* x x)))\n</source>\n\nAnonymous functions ([[function literal]]s) are defined using <code>lambda</code> expressions, e.g. <code>(lambda&nbsp;(x)&nbsp;(*&nbsp;x&nbsp;x))</code> for a function that squares its argument. Lisp programming style frequently uses higher-order functions for which it is useful to provide anonymous functions as arguments.\n\nLocal functions can be defined with <code>flet</code> and <code>labels</code>.\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (flet ((square (x)\n          (* x x)))\n   (square 3))\n</source>\n\nThere are a number of other operators related to the definition and manipulation of functions. For instance, a function may be compiled with the <code>compile</code> operator. (Some Lisp systems run functions using an interpreter by default unless instructed to compile; others compile every function).\n\n====Defining generic functions and methods====\nThe macro <code>defgeneric</code> defines generic functions. Generic functions are a collection of methods.\nThe macro <code>defmethod</code> defines methods.\n\nMethods can specialize their parameters over CLOS ''standard classes'', ''system classes'', ''structure classes'' or objects. For many types there are corresponding ''system classes''.\n\nWhen a generic function is called, multiple-dispatch will determine the effective method to use.\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (defgeneric add (a b))\n</source>\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (defmethod add ((a number) (b number))\n    (+ a b))\n</source>\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (defmethod add ((a vector) (b number))\n    (map 'vector (lambda (n) (+ n b)) a))\n</source>\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (defmethod add ((a vector) (b vector))\n    (map 'vector #'+ a b))\n</source>\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n(defmethod add ((a string) (b string))\n  (concatenate 'string a b) )\n</source>\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (add 2 3)                   ; returns 5\n (add #(1 2 3 4) 7)          ; returns #(8 9 10 11)\n (add #(1 2 3 4) #(4 3 2 1)) ; returns #(5 5 5 5)\n (add \"COMMON \" \"LISP\")      ; returns \"COMMON LISP\"\n</source>\n\nGeneric Functions are also a first class data type. There are many more features to Generic Functions and Methods than described above.\n\n====The function namespace====\n<!-- This section name is linked from several places; if you change it, update the links. -->\n\nThe namespace for function names is separate from the namespace for data variables. This is a key difference between Common Lisp and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]. For Common Lisp, operators that define names in the function namespace include <code>defun</code>, <code>flet</code>, <code>labels</code>, <code>defmethod</code> and <code>defgeneric</code>.\n\nTo pass a function by name as an argument to another function, one must use the <code>function</code> special operator, commonly abbreviated as <code>#'</code>. The first <code>sort</code> example above refers to the function named by the symbol <code>&gt;</code> in the function namespace, with the code <code>#'&gt;</code>. Conversely, to call a function passed in such a way, one would use the <code>funcall</code> operator on the argument.\n\n[[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme's]] evaluation model is simpler: there is only one namespace, and all positions in the form are evaluated (in any order) -- not just the arguments. Code written in one dialect is therefore sometimes confusing to programmers more experienced in the other. For instance, many Common Lisp programmers like to use descriptive variable names such as ''list'' or ''string'' which could cause problems in Scheme, as they would locally shadow function names.\n\nWhether a separate namespace for functions is an advantage is a source of contention in the Lisp community. It is usually referred to as the ''Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2 debate''. Lisp-1 refers to Scheme's model and Lisp-2 refers to Common Lisp's model. These names were coined in a 1988 paper by [[Richard P. Gabriel]] and [[Kent Pitman]], which extensively compares the two approaches.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Technical Issues of Separation in Function Cells and Value Cells |url=http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Technical-Issues.html |authors=Richard P. Gabriel, Kent M. Pitman |journal=Lisp and Symbolic Computation |date = June 1988|volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=81\u2013101 |doi=10.1007/bf01806178}}</ref>\n\n====Multiple return values====\n\nCommon Lisp supports the concept of ''multiple values'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Lisp Hyperspec: Section 3.1.7|url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/03_ag.htm}}</ref> where any expression always has a single ''primary value'', but it might also have any number of ''secondary values'', which might be received and inspected by interested callers. This concept is distinct from returning a list value, as the secondary values are fully optional, and passed via a dedicated side channel. This means that callers may remain entirely unaware of the secondary values being there if they have no need for them, and it makes it convenient to use the mechanism for communicating information that is sometimes useful, but not always necessary. For example,\n\n* The <code>TRUNCATE</code> function<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Lisp Hyperspec: Function FLOOR|url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_floorc.htm}}</ref> rounds the given number to an [[integer]] towards zero. However, it also returns a remainder as a secondary value, making it very easy to determine what value was truncated. It also supports an optional divisor parameter, which can be used to perform [[Euclidean division]] trivially:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cl\">\n(let ((x 1266778)\n      (y 458))\n  (multiple-value-bind (quotient remainder)\n      (truncate x y)\n    (format nil \"~A divided by ~A is ~A remainder ~A\" x y quotient remainder)))\n\n;;;; => \"1266778 divided by 458 is 2765 remainder 408\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n* <code>GETHASH</code><ref>{{cite web|title=Common Lisp Hyperspec: Accessor GETHASH|url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_gethas.htm}}</ref> returns the value of a key in an [[associative map]], or the default value otherwise, and a secondary boolean indicating whether the value was found. Thus code which does not care about whether the value was found or provided as the default can simply use it as-is, but when such distinction is important, it might inspect the secondary boolean and react appropriately. Both use cases are supported by the same call and neither is unnecessarily burdened or constrained by the other. Having this feature at the language level removes the need to check for the existence of the key or compare it to [[Null morpheme|null]] as would be done in other languages.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cl\">\n(defun get-answer (library)\n  (gethash 'answer library 42))\n\n(defun the-answer-1 (library)\n  (format nil \"The answer is ~A\" (get-answer library)))\n;;;; Returns \"The answer is 42\" if ANSWER not present in LIBRARY\n\n(defun the-answer-2 (library)\n  (multiple-value-bind (answer sure-p)\n      (get-answer library)\n    (if (not sure-p)\n        \"I don't know\"\n     (format nil \"The answer is ~A\" answer))))\n;;;; Returns \"I don't know\" if ANSWER not present in LIBRARY\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nMultiple values are supported by a handful of standard forms, most common of which are the <code>MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND</code> special form for accessing secondary values and <code>VALUES</code> for returning multiple values:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cl\">\n(defun magic-eight-ball ()\n  \"Return an outlook prediction, with the probability as a secondary value\"\n  (values \"Outlook good\" (random 1.0)))\n\n;;;; => \"Outlook good\"\n;;;; => 0.3187\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Other types===\nOther data types in Common Lisp include:\n\n*''Pathnames'' represent files and directories in the [[filesystem]]. The Common Lisp pathname facility is more general than most operating systems' file naming conventions, making Lisp programs' access to files broadly portable across diverse systems.\n*Input and output ''streams'' represent sources and sinks of binary or textual data, such as the terminal or open files.\n*Common Lisp has a built-in [[pseudo-random number generator]] (PRNG). ''Random state'' objects represent reusable sources of pseudo-random numbers, allowing the user to seed the PRNG or cause it to replay a sequence.\n*''Conditions'' are a type used to represent errors, exceptions, and other \"interesting\" events to which a program may respond.\n*''Classes'' are [[first-class object]]s, and are themselves instances of classes called [[metaclasses|metaobject classes]] ([[metaclasses]] for short).\n*''Readtables'' are a type of object which control how Common Lisp's reader parses the text of source code.  By controlling which readtable is in use when code is read in, the programmer can change or extend the language's syntax.\n\n==Scope==\n\nLike programs in many other programming languages, Common Lisp programs make use of names to refer to variables, functions, and many other kinds of entities. Named references are subject to scope.\n\nThe association between a name and the entity which the name refers to is called a binding.\n\nScope refers to the set of circumstances in which a name is determined to have a particular binding.\n\n===Determiners of scope===\n\nThe circumstances which determine scope in Common Lisp include:\n\n* the location of a reference within an expression. If it's the leftmost position of a compound, it refers to a special operator or a macro or function binding, otherwise to a variable binding or something else.\n* the kind of expression in which the reference takes place. For instance, <code>(go x)</code> means transfer control to label <code>x</code>, whereas <code>(print x)</code> refers to the variable <code>x</code>. Both scopes of <code>x</code> can be active in the same region of program text, since tagbody labels are in a separate namespace from variable names. A special form or macro form has complete control over the meanings of all symbols in its syntax. For instance, in <code>(defclass x (a b) ())</code>, a class definition, the <code>(a b)</code> is a list of base classes, so these names are looked up in the space of class names, and <code>x</code> isn't a reference to an existing binding, but the name of a new class being derived from <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. These facts emerge purely from the semantics of <code>defclass</code>. The only generic fact about this expression is that <code>defclass</code> refers to a macro binding; everything else is up to <code>defclass</code>.\n* the location of the reference within the program text. For instance, if a reference to variable <code>x</code> is enclosed in a binding construct such as a <code>let</code> which defines a binding for <code>x</code>, then the reference is in the scope created by that binding.\n* for a variable reference, whether or not a variable symbol has been, locally or globally, declared special. This determines whether the reference is resolved within a lexical environment, or within a dynamic environment.\n* the specific instance of the environment in which the reference is resolved. An environment is a run-time dictionary which maps symbols to bindings. Each kind of reference uses its own kind of environment. References to lexical variables are resolved in a lexical environment, et cetera. More than one environment can be associated with the same reference. For instance, thanks to recursion or the use of multiple threads, multiple activations of the same function can exist at the same time. These activations share the same program text, but each has its own lexical environment instance.\n\nTo understand what a symbol refers to, the Common Lisp programmer must know what kind of reference is being expressed, what kind of scope it uses if it is a variable reference (dynamic versus lexical scope), and also the run-time situation: in what environment is the reference resolved, where was the binding introduced into the environment, et cetera.\n\n===Kinds of environment===\n\n====Global====\n\nSome environments in Lisp are globally pervasive. For instance, if a new type is defined, it is known everywhere thereafter. References to that type look it up in this global environment.\n\n====Dynamic====\n\nOne type of environment in Common Lisp is the dynamic environment. Bindings established in this environment have dynamic extent, which means that a binding is established at the start of the execution of some construct, such as a <code>let</code> block, and disappears when that construct finishes executing: its lifetime is tied to the dynamic activation and deactivation of a block. However, a dynamic binding is not just visible within that block; it is also visible to all functions invoked from that block.  This type of visibility is known as indefinite scope. Bindings which exhibit dynamic extent (lifetime tied to the activation and deactivation of a block) and indefinite scope  (visible to all functions which are called from that block) are said to have dynamic scope.\n\nCommon Lisp has support for dynamically scoped variables, which are also called special variables.  Certain other kinds of bindings are necessarily dynamically scoped also, such as restarts and catch tags.  Function bindings cannot be dynamically scoped using <code>flet</code> (which only provides lexically scoped function bindings), but function objects (a first-level object in Common Lisp) can be assigned to dynamically scoped variables, bound using <code>let</code> in dynamic scope, then called using <code>funcall</code> or <code>APPLY</code>.\n\nDynamic scope is extremely useful because it adds referential clarity and discipline to [[global variable]]s. Global variables are frowned upon in computer science as potential sources of error, because they can give rise to ad-hoc, covert channels of communication among modules that lead to unwanted, surprising interactions.\n\nIn Common Lisp, a special variable which has only a top-level binding behaves just like a global variable in other programming languages. A new value can be stored into it, and that value simply replaces what is in the top-level binding. Careless replacement of the value of a global variable is at the heart of bugs caused by use of global variables. However, another way to work with a special variable is to give it a new, local binding within an expression. This is sometimes referred to as \"rebinding\" the variable. Binding a dynamically scoped variable temporarily creates a new memory location for that variable, and associates the name with that location. While that binding is in effect, all references to that variable refer to the new binding; the previous binding is hidden. When execution of the binding expression terminates, the temporary memory location is gone, and the old binding is revealed, with the original value intact. Of course, multiple dynamic bindings for the same variable can be nested.\n\nIn Common Lisp implementations which support multithreading, dynamic scopes are specific to each thread of execution. Thus special variables serve as an abstraction for thread local storage. If one thread rebinds a special variable, this rebinding has no effect on that variable in other threads. The value stored in a binding can only be retrieved by the thread which created that binding. If each thread binds some special variable <code>*x*</code>, then <code>*x*</code> behaves like thread-local storage. Among threads which do not rebind <code>*x*</code>, it behaves like an ordinary global: all of these threads refer to the same top-level binding of <code>*x*</code>.\n\nDynamic variables can be used to extend the execution context with additional context information which is implicitly passed from function to function without having to appear as an extra function parameter. This is especially useful when the control transfer has to pass through layers of unrelated code, which simply cannot be extended with extra parameters to pass the additional data. A situation like this usually calls for a global variable. That global variable must be saved and restored, so that the scheme doesn't break under recursion: dynamic variable rebinding takes care of this. And that variable must be made thread-local (or else a big mutex must be used) so the scheme doesn't break under threads: dynamic scope implementations can take care of this also.\n\nIn the Common Lisp library, there are many standard special variables. For instance, all standard I/O streams are stored in the top-level bindings of well-known special variables. The standard output stream is stored in *standard-output*.\n\nSuppose a function foo writes to standard output:\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n  (defun foo ()\n    (format t \"Hello, world\"))\n</source>\n\nTo capture its output in a character string, *standard-output* can be bound to a string stream and called:\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n  (with-output-to-string (*standard-output*)\n    (foo))\n</source>\n\n  -> \"Hello, world\" ; gathered output returned as a string\n\n====Lexical====\n\nCommon Lisp supports lexical environments. Formally, the bindings in a lexical environment have [[lexical scope]] and may have either indefinite extent or dynamic extent, depending on the type of namespace. [[Lexical scope]] means that visibility is physically restricted to the block in which the binding is established. References which are not textually (i.e. lexically) embedded in that block simply do not see that binding.\n\nThe tags in a TAGBODY have lexical scope. The expression (GO X) is erroneous if it is not actually embedded in a TAGBODY which contains a label X. However, the label bindings disappear when the TAGBODY terminates its execution, because they have dynamic extent. If that block of code is re-entered by the invocation of a lexical closure, it is invalid for the body of that closure to try to transfer control to a tag via GO:\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n  (defvar *stashed*) ;; will hold a function\n\n  (tagbody\n    (setf *stashed* (lambda () (go some-label)))\n    (go end-label) ;; skip the (print \"Hello\")\n   some-label\n    (print \"Hello\")\n   end-label)\n  -> NIL\n</source>\n\nWhen the TAGBODY is executed, it first evaluates the setf form which stores a function in the special variable *stashed*. Then the (go end-label) transfers control to end-label, skipping the code (print \"Hello\"). Since end-label is at the end of the tagbody, the tagbody terminates, yielding NIL. Suppose that the previously remembered function is now called:\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n  (funcall *stashed*) ;; Error!\n</source>\n\nThis situation is erroneous. One implementation's response is an error condition containing the message, \"GO: tagbody for tag SOME-LABEL has already been left\". The function tried to evaluate (go some-label), which is lexically embedded in the tagbody, and resolves to the label. However, the tagbody isn't executing (its extent has ended), and so the control transfer cannot take place.\n\nLocal function bindings in Lisp have [[lexical scope]], and variable bindings also have lexical scope by default. By contrast with GO labels, both of these have indefinite extent. When a lexical function or variable binding is established, that binding continues to exist for as long as references to it are possible, even after the construct which established that binding has terminated. References to lexical variables and functions after the termination of their establishing construct are possible thanks to [[lexical closure]]s.\n\nLexical binding is the default binding mode for Common Lisp variables. For an individual symbol, it can be switched to dynamic scope, either by a local declaration, by a global declaration. The latter may occur implicitly through the use of a construct like DEFVAR or DEFPARAMETER. It is an important convention in Common Lisp programming that special (i.e. dynamically scoped) variables have names which begin and end with an asterisk [[Sigil (computer programming)|sigil]] <code>*</code> in what is called the \u201c[[earmuff]] convention\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap2.html|title=Let Over Lambda|author=|date=|website=letoverlambda.com}}</ref> If adhered to, this convention effectively creates a separate namespace for special variables, so that variables intended to be lexical are not accidentally made special.\n\n[[Lexical scope]] is useful for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, references to variables and functions can be compiled to efficient machine code, because the run-time environment structure is relatively simple. In many cases it can be optimized to stack storage, so opening and closing lexical scopes has minimal overhead. Even in cases where full closures must be generated, access to the closure's environment is still efficient; typically each variable becomes an offset into a vector of bindings, and so a variable reference becomes a simple load or store instruction with a base-plus-offset [[addressing mode]].\n\nSecondly, lexical scope (combined with indefinite extent) gives rise to the [[lexical closure]], which in turn creates a whole paradigm of programming centered around the use of functions being first-class objects, which is at the root of functional programming.\n\nThirdly, perhaps most importantly, even if lexical closures are not exploited, the use of lexical scope isolates program modules from unwanted interactions. Due to their restricted visibility, lexical variables are private. If one module A binds a lexical variable X, and calls another module B, references to X in B will not accidentally resolve to the X bound in A. B simply has no access to X. For situations in which disciplined interactions through a variable are desirable, Common Lisp provides special variables. Special variables allow for a module A to set up a binding for a variable X which is visible to another module B, called from A. Being able to do this is an advantage, and being able to prevent it from happening is also an advantage; consequently, Common Lisp supports both lexical and [[dynamic scope]].\n\n==Macros==\nA ''[[Macro (computer science)|macro]]'' in Lisp superficially resembles a function in usage. However, rather than representing an expression which is evaluated, it represents a transformation of the program source code. The macro gets the source it surrounds as arguments, binds them to its parameters and computes a new source form. This new form can also use a macro. The macro expansion is repeated until the new source form does not use a macro. The final computed form is the source code executed at runtime.\n\nTypical uses of macros in Lisp:\n\n* new control structures (example: looping constructs, branching constructs)\n* scoping and binding constructs\n* simplified syntax for complex and repeated source code\n* top-level defining forms with compile-time side-effects\n* data-driven programming\n* embedded domain specific languages (examples: SQL, HTML, Prolog)\n* implicit finalization forms\n\nVarious standard Common Lisp features also need to be implemented as macros, such as:\n\n* the standard <code>setf</code> abstraction, to allow custom compile-time expansions of assignment/access operators\n* <code>with-accessors</code>, <code>with-slots</code>, <code>with-open-file</code> and other similar <code>WITH</code> macros\n* Depending on implementation, <code>if</code> or <code>cond</code> is a macro built on the other, the special operator; <code>when</code> and <code>unless</code> consist of macros\n* The powerful <code>loop</code> domain-specific language\n\nMacros are defined by the ''defmacro'' macro. The special operator ''macrolet'' allows the definition of local (lexically scoped) macros. It is also possible to define macros for symbols using ''define-symbol-macro'' and ''symbol-macrolet''.\n\n[[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]]'s book [[On Lisp]] describes the use of macros in Common Lisp in detail.  [[Doug Hoyte]]'s book [[Let Over Lambda]] extends the discussion on macros, claiming \"Macros are the single greatest advantage that lisp has as a programming language and the single greatest advantage of any programming language.\"  Hoyte provides several examples of iterative development of macros.\n\n===Example using a macro to define a new control structure===\nMacros allow Lisp programmers to create new syntactic forms in the language. One typical use is to create new control structures. The example macro provides an <code>until</code> looping construct. The syntax is:\n\n<source lang=\"text\">\n(until test form*)\n</source>\n\nThe macro definition for ''until'':\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n(defmacro until (test &body body)\n  (let ((start-tag (gensym \"START\"))\n        (end-tag   (gensym \"END\")))\n    `(tagbody ,start-tag\n              (when ,test (go ,end-tag))\n              (progn ,@body)\n              (go ,start-tag)\n              ,end-tag)))\n</source>\n\n''tagbody'' is a primitive Common Lisp special operator which provides the ability to name tags and use the ''go'' form to jump to those tags. The backquote ''`'' provides a notation that provides code templates, where the value of forms preceded with a comma are filled in. Forms preceded with comma and at-sign are ''spliced'' in. The tagbody form tests the end condition. If the condition is true, it jumps to the end tag. Otherwise the provided body code is executed and then it jumps to the start tag.\n\nAn example form using above ''until'' macro:\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n(until (= (random 10) 0)\n  (write-line \"Hello\"))\n</source>\n\nThe code can be expanded using the function ''macroexpand-1''. The expansion for above example looks like this:\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n(TAGBODY\n #:START1136\n (WHEN (ZEROP (RANDOM 10))\n   (GO #:END1137))\n (PROGN (WRITE-LINE \"hello\"))\n (GO #:START1136)\n #:END1137)\n</source>\n\nDuring macro expansion the value of the variable ''test'' is ''(= (random 10) 0)'' and the value of the variable ''body'' is ''((write-line \"Hello\"))''. The body is a list of forms.\n\nSymbols are usually automatically upcased. The expansion uses the TAGBODY with two labels. The symbols for these labels are computed by GENSYM and are not interned in any package. Two ''go'' forms use these tags to jump to. Since ''tagbody'' is a primitive operator in Common Lisp (and not a macro), it will not be expanded into something else. The expanded form uses the ''when'' macro, which also will be expanded. Fully expanding a source form is called ''code walking''.\n\nIn the fully expanded (''walked'') form, the ''when'' form is replaced by the primitive ''if'':\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n(TAGBODY\n #:START1136\n (IF (ZEROP (RANDOM 10))\n     (PROGN (GO #:END1137))\n   NIL)\n (PROGN (WRITE-LINE \"hello\"))\n (GO #:START1136))\n #:END1137)\n</source>\n\nAll macros must be expanded before the source code containing them can be evaluated or compiled normally.  Macros can be considered functions that accept and return [[S-expression]]s - similar to [[abstract syntax tree]]s, but not limited to those. These functions are invoked before the evaluator or compiler to produce the final source code.\nMacros are written in normal Common Lisp, and may use any Common Lisp (or third-party) operator available.\n\n===Variable capture and shadowing===\nCommon Lisp macros are capable of what is commonly called ''variable capture'', where symbols in the macro-expansion body coincide with those in the calling context, allowing the programmer to create macros wherein various symbols have special meaning. The term ''variable capture'' is somewhat misleading, because all namespaces are vulnerable to unwanted capture, including the operator and function namespace, the tagbody label namespace, catch tag, condition handler and restart namespaces.\n\n''Variable capture'' can introduce software defects. This happens in one of the following two ways:\n\n* In the first way, a macro expansion can inadvertently make a symbolic reference which the macro writer assumed will resolve in a global namespace, but the code where the macro is expanded happens to provide a local, shadowing definition which steals that reference. Let this be referred to as type 1 capture.\n* The second way, type 2 capture, is just the opposite: some of the arguments of the macro are pieces of code supplied by the macro caller, and those pieces of code are written such that they make references to surrounding bindings. However, the macro inserts these pieces of code into an expansion which defines its own bindings that accidentally captures some of these references.\n\nThe Scheme dialect of Lisp provides a macro-writing system which provides the referential transparency that eliminates both types of capture problem. This type of macro system is sometimes called \"hygienic\", in particular by its proponents (who regard macro systems which do not automatically solve this problem as unhygienic). {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn Common Lisp, macro hygiene is ensured one of two different ways.\n\nOne approach is to use [[gensym]]s: guaranteed-unique symbols which can be used in a macro-expansion without threat of capture. The use of gensyms in a macro definition is a manual chore, but macros can be written which simplify the instantiation and use of gensyms.  Gensyms solve type 2 capture easily, but they are not applicable to type 1 capture in the same way, because the macro expansion cannot rename the interfering symbols in the surrounding code which capture its references. Gensyms could be used to provide stable aliases for the global symbols which the macro expansion needs. The macro expansion would use these secret aliases rather than the well-known names, so redefinition of the well-known names would have no ill effect on the macro.\n\nAnother approach is to use packages. A macro defined in its own package can simply use internal symbols in that package in its expansion. The use of packages deals with type 1 and type 2 capture.\n\nHowever, packages don't solve the type 1 capture of references to standard Common Lisp functions and operators. The reason is that the use of packages to solve capture problems revolves around the use of private symbols (symbols in one package, which are not imported into, or otherwise made visible in other packages).  Whereas the Common Lisp library symbols are external, and frequently imported into or made visible in user-defined packages.\n\nThe following is an example of unwanted capture in the operator namespace, occurring in the expansion of a macro:\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n ;; expansion of UNTIL makes liberal use of DO\n (defmacro until (expression &body body)\n   `(do () (,expression) ,@body))\n\n ;; macrolet establishes lexical operator binding for DO\n (macrolet ((do (...) ... something else ...))\n   (until (= (random 10) 0) (write-line \"Hello\")))\n</source>\n\nThe <code>until</code> macro will expand into a form which calls <code>do</code> which is intended to refer to the standard Common Lisp macro <code>do</code>. However, in this context, <code>do</code> may have a completely different meaning, so <code>until</code> may not work properly.\n\nCommon Lisp solves the problem of the shadowing of standard operators and functions by forbidding their redefinition. Because it redefines the standard operator <code>do</code>, the preceding is actually a fragment of non-conforming Common Lisp, which allows implementations to diagnose and reject it.\n\n==Condition system==\nThe ''condition system'' is responsible for [[exception handling]] in Common Lisp.<ref name=\"Seibel2005\">{{cite book|author=Peter Seibel|title=Practical Common Lisp|url=http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html|date=7 April 2005|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-59059-239-7}}</ref> It provides ''conditions'', ''handler''s and ''restart''s. ''Condition''s are objects describing an exceptional situation (for example an error). If a ''condition'' is signaled, the Common Lisp system searches for a ''handler'' for this condition type and calls the handler. The ''handler'' can now search for restarts and use one of these restarts to automatically repair the current problem, using information such as the condition type and any relevant information provided as part of the condition object, and call the appropriate restart function.\n\nThese restarts, if unhandled by code, can be presented to users (as part of a user interface, that of a debugger for example), so that the user can select and invoke one of the available restarts. Since the condition handler is called in the context of the error (without unwinding the stack), full error recovery is possible in many cases, where other exception handling systems would have already terminated the current routine. The debugger itself can also be customized or replaced using the <code>*debugger-hook*</code> dynamic variable. Code found within ''unwind-protect'' forms such as finalizers will also be executed as appropriate despite the exception.\n\nIn the following example (using [[Symbolics Genera]]) the user tries to open a file in a Lisp function ''test'' called from the Read-Eval-Print-LOOP ([[REPL]]), when the file does not exist. The Lisp system presents four restarts. The user selects the ''Retry OPEN using a different pathname'' restart and enters a different pathname (lispm-init.lisp instead of lispm-int.lisp). The user code does not contain any error handling code. The whole error handling and restart code is provided by the Lisp system, which can handle and repair the error without terminating the user code.\n\n<source lang=\"text\">\nCommand: (test \">zippy>lispm-int.lisp\")\n\nError: The file was not found.\n       For lispm:>zippy>lispm-int.lisp.newest\n\nLMFS:OPEN-LOCAL-LMFS-1\n   Arg 0: #P\"lispm:>zippy>lispm-int.lisp.newest\"\n\ns-A, <Resume>: Retry OPEN of lispm:>zippy>lispm-int.lisp.newest\ns-B:           Retry OPEN using a different pathname\ns-C, <Abort>:  Return to Lisp Top Level in a TELNET server\ns-D:           Restart process TELNET terminal\n\n-> Retry OPEN using a different pathname\nUse what pathname instead [default lispm:>zippy>lispm-int.lisp.newest]:\n   lispm:>zippy>lispm-init.lisp.newest\n\n...the program continues\n</source>\n\n==Common Lisp Object System (CLOS)==\n\n{{Main|Common Lisp Object System}}\n\nCommon Lisp includes a toolkit for [[object-oriented programming]], the Common Lisp Object System or [[Common Lisp Object System|CLOS]], which is one of the most powerful object systems available in any language. For example, [[Peter Norvig]] explains how many [[Design pattern (computer science)|Design Patterns]] are simpler to implement in a dynamic language with the features of CLOS (Multiple Inheritance, Mixins, Multimethods, Metaclasses, Method combinations, etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://norvig.com/design-patterns/ppframe.htm|title=Design Patterns in Dynamic Programming|author=|date=|website=norvig.com}}</ref>\nSeveral extensions to Common Lisp for object-oriented programming have been proposed to be included into the ANSI Common Lisp standard, but eventually CLOS was adopted as the standard object-system for Common Lisp. CLOS is a [[dynamic programming language|dynamic]] object system with [[multiple dispatch]] and [[multiple inheritance]], and differs radically from the OOP facilities found in static languages such as [[C++]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. As a dynamic object system, CLOS allows changes at runtime to generic functions and classes. Methods can be added and removed, classes can be added and redefined, objects can be updated for class changes and the class of objects can be changed.\n\nCLOS has been integrated into ANSI Common Lisp. Generic Functions can be used like normal functions and are a first-class data type. Every CLOS class is integrated into the Common Lisp type system. Many Common Lisp types have a corresponding class. There is more potential use of CLOS for Common Lisp. The specification does not say whether conditions are implemented with CLOS. Pathnames and streams could be implemented with CLOS. These further usage possibilities of CLOS for ANSI Common Lisp are not part of the standard. Actual Common Lisp implementations are using CLOS for pathnames, streams, input/output, conditions, the implementation of CLOS itself and more.\n\n==Compiler and interpreter==\nSeveral implementations of earlier Lisp dialects provided both an interpreter and a compiler. Unfortunately often the semantics were different. These earlier Lisps implemented lexical scoping in the compiler and dynamic scoping in the interpreter. Common Lisp requires that both the interpreter and compiler use lexical scoping by default. The Common Lisp standard describes both the semantics of the interpreter and a compiler. The compiler can be called using the function ''compile'' for individual functions and using the function ''compile-file'' for files. Common Lisp allows type declarations and provides ways to influence the compiler code generation policy. For the latter various optimization qualities can be given values between 0 (not important) and 3 (most important): ''speed'', ''space'', ''safety'', ''debug'' and ''compilation-speed''.\n\nThere is also a function to evaluate Lisp code: <code>eval</code>. <code>eval</code> takes code as pre-parsed s-expressions and not, like in some other languages, as text strings. This way code can be constructed with the usual Lisp functions for constructing lists and symbols and then this code can be evaluated with the function <code>eval</code>. Several Common Lisp implementations (like Clozure CL and SBCL) are implementing <code>eval</code> using their compiler. This way code is compiled, even though it is evaluated using the function <code>eval</code>.\n\nThe file compiler is invoked using the function ''compile-file''.  The generated file with compiled code is called a ''fasl'' (from ''fast load'') file. These ''fasl'' files and also source code files can be loaded with the function ''load'' into a running Common Lisp system. Depending on the implementation, the file compiler generates byte-code (for example for the [[Java Virtual Machine]]), [[C (programming language)|C language]] code (which then is compiled with a C compiler) or, directly, native code.\n\nCommon Lisp implementations can be used interactively, even though the code gets fully compiled. The idea of an [[Interpreted language]] thus does not apply for interactive Common Lisp.\n\nThe language makes distinction between read-time, compile-time, load-time and run-time, and allows user code to also make this distinction to perform the wanted type of processing at the wanted step.\n\nSome special operators are provided to especially suit interactive development; for instance, <code>defvar</code> will only assign a value to its provided variable if it wasn't already bound, while <code>defparameter</code> will always perform the assignment. This distinction is useful when interactively evaluating, compiling and loading code in a live image.\n\nSome features are also provided to help writing compilers and interpreters. Symbols consist of first-level objects and are directly manipulable by user code.  The <code>progv</code> special operator allows to create lexical bindings programmatically, while packages are also manipulable. The Lisp compiler is available at runtime to compile files or individual functions. These make it easy to use Lisp as an intermediate compiler or interpreter for another language.\n\n==Code examples==\n\n===Birthday paradox===\nThe following program calculates the smallest number of people in a room for whom the probability of completely unique birthdays is less than 50% (the [[birthday paradox]], where for 1 person the probability is obviously 100%, for 2 it is 364/365, etc.).

Scheme predates CL, and comes not only from the same Lisp tradition but from some of the same engineers\u2014[[Guy L. Steele, Jr.|Guy L. Steele]], with whom [[Gerald Jay Sussman]] designed Scheme, chaired the standards committee for Common Lisp.\n\nCommon Lisp is a general-purpose programming language, in contrast to Lisp variants such as [[Emacs Lisp]] and [[AutoLISP]] which are [[extension languages]] embedded in particular products (GNU Emacs and AutoCAD, respectively). Unlike many earlier Lisps, Common Lisp (like [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]) uses lexical variable [[scope (programming)|scope]] by default for both interpreted and compiled code.\n\nMost of the Lisp systems whose designs contributed to Common Lisp\u2014such as [[ZetaLisp]] and Franz Lisp\u2014used dynamically [[scope (programming)|scoped]] variables in their interpreters and lexically scoped variables in their compilers. Scheme introduced the sole use of lexically scoped variables to Lisp; an inspiration from [[ALGOL 68]] which was widely recognized as a good idea. CL supports dynamically scoped variables as well, but they must be explicitly declared as \"special\". There are no differences in scoping between ANSI CL interpreters and compilers.\n\nCommon Lisp is sometimes termed a ''Lisp-2'' and Scheme a ''Lisp-1'', referring to CL's use of separate namespaces for functions and variables. (In fact, CL has ''many'' namespaces, such as those for go tags, block names, and <code>loop</code> keywords). There is a long-standing controversy between CL and Scheme advocates over the tradeoffs involved in multiple namespaces. In Scheme, it is (broadly) necessary to avoid giving variables names which clash with functions; Scheme functions frequently have arguments named <code>lis</code>, <code>lst</code>, or <code>lyst</code> so as not to conflict with the system function <code>list</code>. However, in CL it is necessary to explicitly refer to the function namespace when passing a function as an argument\u2014which is also a common occurrence, as in the <code>sort</code> example above.\n\nCL also differs from Scheme in its handling of boolean values. Scheme uses the special values #t and #f to represent truth and falsity. CL follows the older Lisp convention of using the symbols T and NIL, with NIL standing also for the empty list. In CL, ''any'' non-NIL value is treated as true by conditionals, such as <code>if</code>, whereas in Scheme all non-#f values are treated as true. These conventions allow some operators in both languages to serve both as predicates (answering a boolean-valued question) and as returning a useful value for further computation, but in Scheme the value '() which is equivalent to NIL in Common Lisp evaluates to true in a boolean expression.\n\nLastly, the Scheme standards documents require [[tail recursion|tail-call optimization]], which the CL standard does not. Most CL implementations do offer tail-call optimization, although often only when the programmer uses an optimization directive. Nonetheless, common CL coding style does not favor the ubiquitous use of recursion that Scheme style prefers\u2014what a Scheme programmer would express with tail recursion, a CL user would usually express with an iterative expression in <code>do</code>, <code>dolist</code>, <code>loop</code>, or (more recently) with the <code>iterate</code> package.\n\n==Implementations==\n\nSee the Category [[:Category:Common Lisp implementations|Common Lisp implementations]].\n\nCommon Lisp is defined by a specification (like [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]) rather than by one implementation (like [[Perl]] before version 6). There are many implementations, and the standard details areas in which they may validly differ.\n\nIn addition, implementations tend to come with extensions, which provide functionality not covered in the standard:\n\n* Interactive Top-Level (REPL)\n* Garbage Collection\n* Debugger, Stepper and Inspector\n* Weak data structures (hash tables)\n* Extensible sequences\n* Extensible LOOP\n* Environment access\n* CLOS Meta-object Protocol\n* CLOS based extensible streams\n* CLOS based Condition System\n* Network streams\n* Persistent CLOS\n* Unicode support\n* Foreign-Language Interface (often to C)\n* Operating System interface\n* Java Interface\n* Threads and Multiprocessing\n* Application delivery (applications, dynamic libraries)\n* Saving of images\n\n[[Free and open-source software]] libraries have been created to support extensions to Common Lisp in a portable way, and are most notably found in the repositories of the [http://common-lisp.net/ Common-Lisp.net] and [http://clocc.sourceforge.net/ Common Lisp Open Code Collection] projects.\n\nCommon Lisp implementations may use any mix of native code compilation, byte code compilation or interpretation. Common Lisp has been designed to support [[incremental compiler]]s, file compilers and block compilers. Standard declarations to optimize compilation (such as function inlining or type specialization) are proposed in the language specification. Most Common Lisp implementations compile source code to native [[machine code]]. Some implementations can create (optimized) stand-alone applications. Others compile to interpreted [[bytecode]], which is less efficient than native code, but eases binary-code portability. There are also compilers that compile Common Lisp code to C code. The misconception that Lisp is a purely interpreted language is most likely because Lisp environments provide an interactive prompt and that code is compiled one-by-one, in an incremental way. With Common Lisp incremental compilation is widely used.\n\nSome [[Unix]]-based implementations ([[CLISP]], [[SBCL]]) can be used as a [[scripting language]]; that is, invoked by the system transparently in the way that a [[Perl]] or [[Unix shell]] interpreter is.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/quickstart.html#quickstart-unix|title=32.6.

Allegro CL provides an [[integrated development environment|Integrated Development Environment (IDE)]] (for Windows and Linux) and extensive capabilities for application delivery.\n; [[Liquid Common Lisp]]: formerly called [[Lucid Common Lisp]]. Only maintenance, no new releases.\n; [[LispWorks]]: for Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, Linux, Apple macOS, iOS, Android and various UNIX variants. LispWorks provides an [[integrated development environment|Integrated Development Environment (IDE)]] (available for all platforms, but not for iOS and Android) and extensive capabilities for application delivery.\n; [[mocl]]: for iOS, Android and macOS.\n; [[Open Genera]]: for DEC Alpha.\n; [[Scieneer Common Lisp]]: which is designed for high-performance scientific computing.\n\n====Freely redistributable implementations====\n\n; Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL) : A CL implementation that runs on the [[Java Virtual Machine]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/ | title = Armed Bear Common Lisp }}</ref> It includes a compiler to [[Java byte code]], and allows access to Java libraries from CL. It was formerly just a component of the [[Armed Bear J Editor]].\n; [[CLISP]]: A bytecode-compiling implementation, portable and runs on a number of Unix and Unix-like systems (including [[macOS]]), as well as Microsoft Windows and several other systems.\n; [[Clozure CL]] (CCL) : Originally a [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] fork of Macintosh Common Lisp. As that history implies, CCL was written for the Macintosh, but Clozure CL now runs on [[macOS]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. 32 and 64 bit [[x86]] ports are supported on each platform. Additionally there are Power PC ports for Mac OS and Linux. CCL was previously known as OpenMCL, but that name is no longer used, to avoid confusion with the open source version of Macintosh Common Lisp.\n; [[CMUCL]]: Originally from [[Carnegie Mellon University]], now maintained as [[free and open-source software]] by a group of volunteers. CMUCL uses a fast native-code compiler. It is available on [[Linux]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] for Intel x86; [[Linux]] for Alpha; [[macOS]] for Intel x86 and PowerPC; and Solaris, IRIX, and HP-UX on their native platforms.\n; [[Corman Common Lisp]]: for Microsoft Windows. In January 2015 Corman Lisp has been published under MIT license.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corman Lisp sources are now available|url=http://lispblog.xach.com/post/107215169193/corman-lisp-sources-are-now-available}}</ref>\n; [[Embeddable Common Lisp]] (ECL) : ECL includes a bytecode interpreter and compiler. It can also compile Lisp code to machine code via a C compiler. ECL then compiles Lisp code to C, compiles the C code with a C compiler and can then load the resulting machine code. It is also possible to embed ECL in [[C (programming language)|C]] programs, and C code into Common Lisp programs.\n; [[GNU Common Lisp]] (GCL) : The [[GNU]] Project's Lisp compiler. Not yet fully ANSI-compliant, GCL is however the implementation of choice for several large projects including the mathematical tools [[Maxima (software)|Maxima]], [[Axiom (computer algebra system)|AXIOM]] and (historically) [[ACL2]]. GCL runs on [[Linux]] under eleven different architectures, and also under Windows, Solaris, and [[FreeBSD]].\n; [[Macintosh Common Lisp]] (MCL) : Version 5.2 for Apple Macintosh computers with a PowerPC processor running Mac OS X is open source. RMCL (based on MCL 5.2) runs on Intel-based Apple Macintosh computers using the Rosetta binary translator from Apple.\n; [[ManKai Common Lisp]] (MKCL) : A branch of [[Embeddable Common Lisp|ECL]]. MKCL emphasises reliability, stability and overall code quality through a heavily reworked, natively multi-threaded, runtime system. On Linux, MKCL features a fully POSIX compliant runtime system.\n; [[Movitz]]: Implements a Lisp environment for [[x86]] computers without relying on any underlying OS.\n; [[Poplog]]: Poplog implements a version of CL, with [[POP-11]], and optionally [[Prolog]], and [[Standard ML]] (SML), allowing mixed language programming. For all, the implementation language is POP-11, which is compiled incrementally. It also has an integrated [[Emacs]]-like editor that communicates with the compiler.\n; [[Steel Bank Common Lisp]] (SBCL) : A branch from [[CMUCL]]. \"Broadly speaking, SBCL is distinguished from CMU CL by a greater emphasis on maintainability.\"<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/history.html\n | title = History and Copyright | work = Steel Bank Common Lisp\n}}</ref> SBCL runs on the platforms CMUCL does, except HP/UX; in addition, it runs on Linux for AMD64, PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS, Windows x86<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html\n | title = Platform Table | work = Steel Bank Common Lisp\n}}</ref> and has experimental support for running on Windows AMD64.

Similarly, [[hospital emergency codes]] often incorporate colors (such as the widely used \"Code Blue\" indicating a [[cardiac arrest]]), although they may also include numbers, and may not conform to a uniform standard.\n\nColor codes do present some potential problems. On forms and signage, the use of color can distract from black and white text.<ref name=\"Cohen\">See, e.g., Michael Richard Cohen, ''Medication Errors'' (2007), p. 119.</ref> They are often difficult for [[color blindness|color blind]] and blind people to interpret, and even for those with normal color vision, use of a large number of colors to code a large number of variables can lead to use of confusingly similar colors.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/><ref name=\"Cohen\"/>\n\n==Examples==\nSystems incorporating color-coding include:\n\n*In electronics:\n**[[Electrical wiring]] \u2013 AC power phase, neutral, and grounding wires\n**[[Electronic color code]] \u2013 for electronic components\n**[[Jump start (vehicle)|Jumper cables]] used to jump-start a vehicle\n**[[Surround sound#Channel

Co., {{ISBN|978-0-201-55540-0}}, {{Zbl|0848.13001}}</ref>  More precisely, given any small positive distance, all but a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than that given distance from each other.\n\nIt is not sufficient for each term to become arbitrarily close to the {{em|preceding}} term. For instance, in the sequence of square roots of natural numbers:\n:<math>a_n=\\sqrt n,</math>\nthe consecutive terms become arbitrarily close to each other:\n:<math>a_{n+1}-a_n = \\sqrt{n+1}-\\sqrt{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n+1}+\\sqrt{n}} < \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt n}.</math>\nHowever, with growing values of the index {{mvar|n}}, the terms {{math|''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} become arbitrarily large, so for any index {{mvar|n}} and distance {{mvar|d}}, there exists an index {{mvar|m}} big enough such that {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub> \u2013 ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> > ''d''}}. (Actually, any {{math|''m'' > ({{sqrt|''n''}} + ''d'')<sup>2</sup>}} suffices.) As a result, despite how far one goes, the remaining terms of the sequence never get close to {{em|each other}}, hence the sequence is not Cauchy.\n\nThe utility of Cauchy sequences lies in the fact that in a [[complete metric space]] (one where all such sequences are known to [[limit of a sequence|converge to a limit]]), the criterion for [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] depends only on the terms of the sequence itself, as opposed to the definition of convergence, which uses the limit value as well as the terms. This is often exploited in [[algorithm]]s, both theoretical and applied,  where an [[Iterative method|iterative process]] can be shown relatively easily to produce a Cauchy sequence, consisting of the iterates, thus fulfilling a logical condition, such as termination.\n\nThe notions above are not as unfamiliar as they might at first appear. The customary acceptance of the fact that any [[real number]] ''x'' has a [[decimal expansion]] is an implicit acknowledgment that a particular Cauchy sequence of rational numbers (whose terms are the successive [[truncation]]s of the decimal expansion of ''x'') has the real limit ''x''. In some cases it may be difficult to describe ''x'' independently of such a limiting process involving [[rational number]]s.\n\nGeneralizations of Cauchy sequences in more abstract [[uniform spaces]] exist in the form of [[Cauchy filter]]s and [[Cauchy net]]s.\n\n==In real numbers==\nA sequence\n\n:<math>x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots </math>\n\nof real numbers is called a Cauchy sequence, if for every [[positive and negative numbers|positive]] real number ''\u03b5'', there is a positive [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all [[natural numbers]] ''m'', ''n'' > ''N''\n\n:<math>|x_m - x_n| < \\varepsilon, </math>\n\nwhere the vertical bars denote the [[absolute value]].  In a similar way one can define Cauchy sequences of rational or complex numbers.  Cauchy formulated such a condition by requiring <math>x_m - x_n</math> to be [[infinitesimal]] for every pair of infinite ''m'', ''n''.\n\n==In a metric space==\n\nSince the definition of a Cauchy sequence only involves metric concepts, it is straightforward to generalize it to any metric space ''X''. To do so, the absolute value |''x''<sub>''m''</sub> - ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>| is replaced by the distance ''d''(''x''<sub>''m''</sub>, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) (where ''d'' denotes a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]) between ''x''<sub>''m''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nFormally, given a [[metric space]] (''X'', ''d''), a sequence\n\n:''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>, ...\n\nis Cauchy, if for every positive [[real number]] ''\u03b5'' > 0 there is a positive  [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all positive integers ''m'', ''n'' > ''N'', the distance\n\n:''d''(''x''<sub>''m''</sub>, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) < ''\u03b5''.\n\nRoughly speaking, the terms of the sequence are getting closer and closer together in a way that suggests that the sequence ought to have a [[limit of a sequence|limit]] in ''X''. Nonetheless, such a limit does not always exist within ''X''.\n\n==Completeness==\nA metric space (''X'', ''d'') in which every Cauchy sequence converges to an element of ''X'' is called [[Complete metric space|complete]].\n\n===Examples===\nThe [[real number]]s are complete under the metric induced by the usual absolute value, and one of the standard [[Construction of the real numbers|constructions of the real numbers]] involves Cauchy sequences of [[rational number]]s. In this construction, each equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers with a certain tail behavior\u2014that is, each class of sequences that get arbitrarily close to one another\u2014 is a real number.\n\nA rather different type of example is afforded by a metric space ''X'' which has the [[discrete space|discrete metric]] (where any two distinct  points are at distance 1 from each other). Any Cauchy sequence of elements of ''X'' must be constant beyond some fixed point, and converges to the eventually repeating term.\n\n===Counter-example: rational numbers===\nThe [[rational number]]s '''Q''' are not complete (for the usual distance):<br/>\nThere are sequences of rationals that converge (in '''R''') to [[irrational number]]s; these are Cauchy sequences having no limit in '''Q'''. In fact, if a real number ''x'' is irrational, then the sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>), whose ''n''-th term is the truncation to ''n'' decimal places of the decimal expansion of ''x'', gives a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers with irrational limit ''x''. Irrational numbers certainly exist in '''R''', for example:\n\n* The sequence defined by <math> x_0=1, x_{n+1}=\\frac{x_n+\\frac{2}{x_n}}{2}</math> consists of rational numbers (1, 3/2, 17/12,...), which is clear from the definition; however it converges to the [[irrational number|irrational]] square root of two, see [[Methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|Babylonian method of computing square root]].\n* The sequence <math>x_n = F_n / F_{n-1}</math> of ratios of consecutive [[Fibonacci number]]s which, if it converges at all, converges to a limit <math>\\phi</math> satisfying <math>\\phi^2 = \\phi+1</math>, and no rational number has this property.  If one considers this as a sequence of real numbers, however, it converges to the real number <math>\\varphi = (1+\\sqrt5)/2</math>, the [[Golden ratio]], which is irrational.\n* The values of the exponential, sine and cosine functions, exp(''x''), sin(''x''), cos(''x''), are known to be irrational for any rational value of ''x''\u22600, but each can be defined as the limit of a rational Cauchy sequence, using, for instance, the [[Maclaurin series]].\n\n===Counter-example: open interval===\nThe open interval <math> X = (0, 2) </math> in the set of real numbers with an ordinary distance in '''R''' is not a complete space: there is a sequence <math> x_n = 1/n </math> in it, which is Cauchy (for arbitrarily small distance bound <math> d > 0 </math> all terms <math> x_n </math> of <math> n > 1/d </math> fit in the <math> (0, d) </math> interval), however does not converge in <math> X </math> \u2014 its 'limit', number <math> 0 </math>, does not belong to the space <math> X </math>.\n\n===Other properties===\n* Every convergent sequence (with limit ''s'', say) is a Cauchy sequence, since, given any real number ''\u03b5'' > 0, beyond some fixed point, every term of the sequence is within distance ''\u03b5''/2 of ''s'', so any two terms of the sequence are within distance ''\u03b5'' of each other.\n* In any metric space, a Cauchy sequence is [[bounded function|bounded]] (since for some ''N'', all terms of the sequence from the ''N''-th onwards are within distance 1 of each other, and if ''M'' is the largest distance of the terms up to and including the ''N''-th, then no term of the sequence has distance greater than ''M'' + 1 from {{math|''x<sub>N</sub>''}}).\n* In any metric space, a Cauchy sequence which has a convergent subsequence with limit ''s'' is itself convergent (with the same limit), since, given any real number ''r'' > 0, beyond some fixed point in the original sequence, every term of the subsequence is within distance ''r''/2 of ''s'', and any two terms of the original sequence are within distance ''r''/2 of each other, so every term of the original sequence is within distance ''r'' of ''s''.\n\nThese last two properties, together with the [[Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem]], yield one standard proof of the completeness of the real numbers, closely related to both the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem and the [[Heine\u2013Borel theorem]]. Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers is bounded, hence by Bolzano-Weierstrass has a convergent subsequence, hence is itself convergent. It should be noted, though, that this proof of the completeness of the real numbers implicitly makes use of the [[least upper bound axiom]]. The alternative approach, mentioned above, of {{em|constructing}} the real numbers as the [[Completion (metric space)|completion]] of the rational numbers, makes the completeness of the real numbers tautological.\n\nOne of the standard illustrations of the advantage of being able to work with Cauchy sequences and make use of completeness is provided by consideration of the summation of an [[infinite series]] of real numbers\n(or, more generally, of elements of any complete [[normed linear space]], or [[Banach space]]).  Such a series \n<math> \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} x_{n}</math> is considered to be convergent if and only if the sequence of [[partial sum]]s <math>(s_{m})</math> is convergent, where \n<math> s_{m} = \\sum_{n=1}^{m} x_{n}</math>. It is a routine matter \nto determine whether the sequence of partial sums is Cauchy or not,\nsince for positive integers ''p'' > ''q'', \n:<math> s_{p} - s_{q} = \\sum_{n=q+1}^{p} x_{n}.</math>\n\nIf <math>f \\colon M \\rightarrow N</math> is a [[uniformly continuous]] map between the metric spaces ''M'' and ''N'' and (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a Cauchy sequence in ''M'', then <math>(f(x_n))</math> is a Cauchy sequence in ''N''. If <math>(x_n)</math> and <math>(y_n)</math> are two Cauchy sequences in the rational, real or complex numbers, then the sum <math>(x_n + y_n)</math> and the product <math>(x_n y_n)</math> are also Cauchy sequences.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===In topological vector spaces===\nThere is also a concept of Cauchy sequence for a [[topological vector space]] <math>X</math>: Pick a [[local base]] <math>B</math> for <math>X</math> about 0; then (<math>x_k</math>) is a Cauchy sequence if for each member <math>V\\in B</math>, there is some number <math>N</math> such that whenever \n<math>n,m > N, \nx_n - x_m</math> is an element of <math>V</math>. If the topology of <math>X</math> is compatible with a [[translation-invariant metric]] <math>d</math>, the two definitions agree.\n\n===In topological groups===\n\nSince the topological vector space definition of Cauchy sequence requires only that there be a continuous \"subtraction\" operation, it can just as well be stated in the context of a [[topological group]]: A sequence <math>(x_k)</math> in a topological group <math>G</math> is a Cauchy sequence if for every open neighbourhood <math>U</math> of the [[identity element|identity]] in <math>G</math> there exists some number <math>N</math> such that whenever <math> m,n>N </math> it follows that <math>x_n x_m^{-1} \\in U</math>. As above, it is sufficient to check this for the neighbourhoods in any local base of the identity in <math>G</math>.\n\nAs in the [[Complete metric space#Completion|construction of the completion of a metric space]], one can furthermore define the binary relation on Cauchy sequences in <math>G</math> that <math>(x_k)</math> and <math>(y_k)</math> are equivalent if for every open [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] <math>U</math> of the identity in <math>G</math> there exists some number <math>N</math> such that whenever <math> m,n>N </math> it follows that <math>x_n y_m^{-1} \\in U</math>. This relation is an [[equivalence relation]]: It is reflexive since the sequences are Cauchy sequences. It is symmetric since <math>y_n x_m^{-1} = (x_m y_n^{-1})^{-1} \\in U^{-1}</math> which by continuity of the inverse is another open neighbourhood of the identity. It is [[Transitive relation|transitive]] since <math>x_n z_l^{-1} = x_n y_m^{-1} y_m z_l^{-1} \\in U' U''</math> where <math>U'</math> and <math>U''</math> are open neighbourhoods of the identity such that <math>U'U'' \\subseteq U</math>; such pairs exist by the continuity of the group operation.\n\n===In groups===\n\nThere is also a concept of Cauchy sequence in a group <math>G</math>:\nLet <math>H=(H_r)</math> be a decreasing sequence of [[normal subgroup]]s of <math>G</math> of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]].\nThen a sequence <math>(x_n)</math> in <math>G</math> is said to be Cauchy (w.r.t. <math>H</math>) [[if and only if]] for any <math>r</math> there is <math>N</math> such that <math>\\forall m,n > N, x_n x_m^{-1} \\in H_r</math>.\n\nTechnically, this is the same thing as a topological group Cauchy sequence for a particular choice of topology on <math>G</math>, namely that for which <math>H</math> is a local base.\n\nThe set <math>C</math> of such Cauchy sequences forms a group (for the componentwise product), and the set <math>C_0</math> of null sequences (s.th. <math>\\forall r, \\exists N, \\forall n > N, x_n \\in H_r</math>) is a normal subgroup of <math>C</math>. The [[factor group]] <math>C/C_0</math> is called the completion of <math>G</math> with respect to <math>H</math>.\n\nOne can then show that this completion is isomorphic to the [[inverse limit]] of the sequence <math>(G/H_r)</math>.\n\nAn example of this construction, familiar in [[number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] is the construction of the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic completion]] of the integers with respect to a prime ''p''. In this case, ''G'' is the integers under addition, and ''H''<sub>''r''</sub> is the additive subgroup consisting of integer multiples of ''p''<sup>''r''</sup>.\n\nIf <math>H</math> is a [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] sequence (i.e., any normal subgroup of finite index contains some <math>H_r</math>), then this completion is [[Canonical form|canonical]] in the sense that it is isomorphic to the inverse limit of <math>(G/H)_H</math>, where <math>H</math> varies over {{em|all}} normal subgroups of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]]. For further details, see ch. I.10 in [[Serge Lang|Lang]]'s \"Algebra\".\n\n===In constructive mathematics===\n{{Tone|section|date=August 2018}}\nIn [[constructive mathematics]], Cauchy sequences often must be given with a ''modulus of Cauchy convergence'' to be useful. If <math>(x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)</math> is a Cauchy sequence in the set <math>X</math>, then a modulus of Cauchy convergence for the sequence is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>\\alpha</math> from the set of [[natural number]]s to itself, such that <math>\\forall k \\forall m, n > \\alpha(k), |x_m - x_n| < 1/k</math>.\n\nClearly, any sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is a Cauchy sequence. The converse (that every Cauchy sequence has a modulus) follows from the [[well-ordering property]] of the natural numbers (let <math>\\alpha(k)</math> be the smallest possible <math>N</math> in the definition of Cauchy sequence, taking <math>r</math> to be <math>1/k</math>). However, this well-ordering property does not hold in constructive mathematics (it is equivalent to the principle of [[excluded middle]]). On the other hand, this converse also follows (directly) from the principle of [[dependent choice]] (in fact, it will follow from the weaker AC<sub>00</sub>), which is generally accepted by constructive mathematicians. Thus, moduli of Cauchy convergence are needed directly only by constructive mathematicians who (like [[Fred Richman]]) do not wish to use any form of choice.\n\nThat said, using a modulus of Cauchy convergence can simplify both definitions and theorems in constructive analysis. Perhaps even more useful are ''regular Cauchy sequences'', sequences with a given modulus of Cauchy convergence (usually <math>\\alpha(k) = k</math> or <math>\\alpha(k) = 2^k</math>). Any Cauchy sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is equivalent (in the sense used to form the [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of a metric space) to a regular Cauchy sequence; this can be proved without using any form of the axiom of choice. Regular Cauchy sequences were used by [[Errett Bishop]] in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7I-AAAAIAAJ&dq=intitle:Foundations+intitle:of+intitle:constructive+intitle:analysis&lr=&as_brr=0&pgis=1 Foundations of Constructive Analysis], but they have also been used by [[Douglas Bridges]] in a non-constructive textbook ({{ISBN|978-0-387-98239-7}}). However, Bridges also works on mathematical constructivism; the concept has not spread far outside of that milieu.\n\n===In a hyperreal continuum===\nA real sequence <math>\\langle u_n: n\\in \\mathbb{N} \\rangle</math> has a natural [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension, defined for [[hypernatural]] values ''H'' of the index ''n'' in addition to the usual natural ''n''.  The sequence is Cauchy if and only if for every infinite ''H'' and ''K'', the values <math>u_H</math> and <math>u_K</math> are infinitely close, or [[adequality|adequal]], i.e. \n:<math>\\, \\mathrm{st}(u_H-u_K)= 0</math> \nwhere \"st\" is the [[standard part function]].\n\n===Cauchy completion of categories===\n\n{{harvtxt|Krause|2018}} introduced a notion of Cauchy completion of a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Applied to '''Q''' (the category whose objects are rational numbers, and there is a morphism from ''x'' to ''y'' if and only if ''x'' &le; ''y''), this Cauchy completion yields '''R''' (again interpreted as a category using its natural ordering).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Modes of convergence (annotated index)]]\n*[[Dedekind cut]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki | author=Bourbaki, Nicolas | title=Commutative Algebra | edition = English translation| publisher=Addison-Wesley | year=1972 | isbn=0-201-00644-8}}\n* {{Citation|title=Completing perfect complexes: With appendices by Tobias Barthel and Bernhard Keller| author1=Krause|first1=Henning| arxiv=1805.10751|year=2018|bibcode=2018arXiv180510751B}}\n* {{Lang Algebra|edition=3}}\n*{{cite book | last = Spivak | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Spivak | title = Calculus | year = 1994 | edition = 3rd | location = Berkeley, CA | publisher = Publish or Perish | isbn = 0-914098-89-6 | url = http://www.mathpop.com/bookhtms/cal.htm}}\n* {{cite book | last = Troelstra | first = A.

Many scholars in historical and religious studies in the West in recent years have sought to lessen the explicitly Christian meaning of this system without abandoning the usefulness of a single, common, global form of dating. For this reason the terms ''common era'' and ''before the common era'', abbreviated as CE and BCE, have grown in popularity as designations.

He is the discoverer of [[Malden Island]] in the central [[Pacific]], which is named in his honour. He also founded [[Windlesham House School]] at [[Brighton]], [[England]].\n\n==Biography==\nMalden was born in [[Putney]], [[Surrey]], son of Jonas Malden, a surgeon. He entered British naval service at the age of 11 on 22 June 1809. He served nine years as a volunteer 1st class, [[midshipman]], and [[shipmate]], including one year in the [[English Channel]] and [[Bay of Biscay]] (1809), four years at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and in the [[East Indies]] (1809\u201314), two and a half years on the North American and West Indian stations (1814\u201316), and a year and a half in the [[Mediterranean]] (1817\u201318). He was present at the capture of [[Mauritius]] and [[Java (island)|Java]], and at the battles of [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]] and [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]].\n\nHe passed the examination in the elements of [[mathematics]] and the theory of [[navigation]] at the [[Royal Naval Academy]] on 2\u20134 September 1816, and became a 1st Lieutenant on 1 September 1818. In eight years of active service as an officer, he served two and a half years in a surveying ship in the Mediterranean (1818\u201321), one and a half years in a surveying sloop in the English Channel and off the coast of [[Ireland]] (1823\u201324), and one and a half years as Surveyor of the frigate {{HMS|Blonde|1819|6}} during a voyage (1824\u201326) to and from the [[Hawaiian Islands]] (then known as the \"Sandwich islands\").<ref name=\"macrae\">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6aYcAAAAMAAJ |title= With Lord Byron at the Sandwich Islands in 1825: Being Extracts from the MS Diary of James Macrae, Scottish botanist |year=1922 |author= James Macrae |editor= William Frederick Wilson |isbn= 978-0-554-60526-5 }}</ref>\nIn Hawaii he surveyed harbours which, he noted, were \"said not to exist by Captains Cook and Vancouver.\" On the return voyage he discovered and explored uninhabited Malden Island in the central Pacific on 30 July 1825. After his return he left active service but remained at half pay. He served for several years as [[hydrographer]] to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]].\n\nHe married Frances Cole, daughter of Rev. William Hodgson Cole, rector of [[West Clandon]] and Vicar of [[Wonersh]], near [[Guildford]], Surrey, on 8 April 1828. Malden became the father of seven sons and a daughter.\n\nFrom 1830-36 he took pupils for the Royal Navy at [[Ryde]], [[Isle of Wight]]. He purchased the school of [[Sir Henry Worsley, 2nd Baronet|Henry Worsley]] at [[Newport, Isle of Wight|Newport]], Isle of Wight, in December 1836, reopened it as a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]] on 20 February 1837, and moved it to Montpelier Road in Brighton in December 1837. He built the [[Windlesham House School]] at Brighton in 1844, and conducted the school until his death there in 1855.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite wikisource | class = dictionary | first = William Richard | last = O'Byrne | chapter = Malden, Charles Robert | wslink = A Naval Biographical Dictionary | title = A Naval Biographical Dictionary | year = 1849 | publisher = [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malden, Charles Robert}}\n[[Category:1797 births]]\n[[Category:1855 deaths]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy officers]]\n[[Category:People from Putney]]", "sha1": "73misrnp2nbftu20bifmrwhslecm648"}}, {"title": "CPD", "ns": "0", "id": "6094", "revision": {"id": "862587797", "parentid": "860063397", "timestamp": "2018-10-05T10:25:06Z", "contributor": {"username": "Widefox", "id": "1588193"}, "comment": "/* Other uses */ f", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''CPD''' may refer to:\n{{TOC right}}\n==Science and technology==\n* [[CPD (gene)]], a human gene encoding the protein Carboxypeptidase D\n* [[Chronic pulmonary disease]], a pathological condition\n* [[Cephalopelvic disproportion]], when the capacity of the pelvis is inadequate to allow the fetus to negotiate the birth canal\n* [[Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer]], a common UV product\n* [[Cyclopentadiene]], an organic compound\n* [[Canonical polyadic decomposition]], in mathematics\n* [[Copy/Paste Detector]], software to find duplicate computer code\n\n==Organizations==\n* [[Centre for Policy Development]], an Australian think tank\n* [[Centre for Policy Dialogue]], Bangladesh\n* [[Centres of Plant Diversity]], a classification initiative\n* [[Commission on Presidential Debates]], a US nonprofit\n* [[Committee on the Present Danger]], an American foreign policy interest group\n\n===Police===\n* [[Cambridge Police Department (Massachusetts)]]\n* [[Camden Police Department (New Jersey)]]\n* [[Carmel Police Department (Indiana)]]\n* [[Charleston Police Department (West Virginia)]]\n* [[Chattanooga Police Department]], Tennessee\n* [[Chicago Police Department]], Illinois\n* [[Cincinnati Police Department]], Ohio\n* [[Cleveland Police Department]], Ohio\n* [[Columbus Police Department]], Ohio\n* [[Town of Carmel Police Department (New York)]]\n\n==Other uses==\n* [[Carnet de Passages en Douane]], a customs document\n* [[Collaborative product development]], in business\n* [[Continuing professional development]]\n* [[Construction Products Directive]], a repealed EU Directive\n* [[Danio margaritatus]] (also known as the Celestial Pearl Danio), a fish native to southeast Asia\n\n==See also==\n* [[CDP (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Congress of People's Deputies (disambiguation)]]\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "rgqqomwszfym118qkckm3k8rwkxb9h0"}}, {"title": "Chechnya", "ns": "0", "id": "6095", "revision": {"id": "863642012", "parentid": "863641662", "timestamp": "2018-10-12T02:05:22Z", "contributor": {"username": "CASSIOPEIA", "id": "31051948"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/213.149.61.196|213.149.61.196]] ([[User talk:213.149.61.196|talk]]): page blanking ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Distinguish|Czech Republic}}\n{{Pp-move-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Infobox Russian federal subject\n|en_name=Chechen Republic\n|ru_name=\u0427\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\n|loc_name1=\u041d\u043e\u0445\u0447\u0438\u0439\u043d \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\n|loc_lang1=Chechen\n|image_map=Map of Russia -

Benoiski broke through the siege and continued to fight Russia for another two years until he was captured and killed by Russians. The Russian tsar hoped that by sparing the life of Shamil, the resistance in the North Caucasus would stop, but it did not. Russia began to use a colonization tactic by destroying Nakh settlements and building Cossack defense lines in the lowlands. The Cossacks suffered defeat after defeat and were constantly attacked by mountaineers, who were robbing them of food and weaponry.\n\nThe tsarists' regime used a different approach at the end of the 1860s. They offered Chechens and Ingush to leave the Caucasus for the [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Muhajir (Caucasus)]]). It is estimated that about 80% of Chechens and Ingush left the Caucasus during the deportation. It weakened the resistance which went from open warfare to insurgent warfare. One of the notable Chechen resistance fighters at the end of the 19th century was a Chechen [[abrek]] [[Zelimxan|Zelimkhan Gushmazukaev]] and his comrade-in-arms Ingush abrek [[Sulom-Beck Sagopshinski]]. Together they built up small units which constantly harassed Russian military convoys, government mints, and government post-service, mainly in Ingushetia and Chechnya. Ingush aul Kek was completely burned when the Ingush refused to hand over Zelimkhan. Zelimkhan was killed at the beginning of the 20th century.

Today, Chechnya is a relatively stable [[federal republic]], although there is still some separatist movement activity. Its regional constitution entered into effect on April 2, 2003, after an all-Chechen referendum was held n March 23, 2003. Some Chechens were controlled by regional [[teip]]s, or clans, despite the existence of pro- and anti-Russian political structures.\n\n===Regional government===\n[[File:Chechnya and Caucasus.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Chechnya and Caucasus map]]\n\nThe former separatist religious leader (mufti) [[Akhmad Kadyrov]], looked upon as a traitor by many separatists, was elected president with 83% of the vote in an internationally monitored election on October 5, 2003. Incidents of [[ballot stuffing]] and voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of separatist parties from the polls were subsequently reported by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) monitors. On May 9, 2004, Kadyrov was assassinated in Grozny football stadium by a [[land mine|landmine]] explosion that was planted beneath a VIP stage and detonated during a parade, and [[Sergey Abramov (politician)|Sergey Abramov]] was appointed to the position of acting prime minister after the incident. However, since 2005 [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] (son of [[Akhmad Kadyrov]]) has been the caretaker prime minister, and in 2007 was appointed as the new president. Many allege he is the wealthiest and most powerful man in the republic, with control over a large private militia referred to as the ''[[Kadyrovtsy]]''. The militia, which began as his father's security force, has been accused of killings and kidnappings by human rights organizations such as [[Human Rights Watch]].\n\nIn 2009, the US government financed American organization [[Freedom House]] included Chechnya in the \"Worst of the Worst\" list of most repressive societies in the world, together with [[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], and others.<ref>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/WoW09/WOW%202009.pdf Worst of the Worst: The World's Most Repressive Societies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110015057/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/WoW09/WOW%202009.pdf |date=November 10, 2011 }} ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]), ''[[Freedom House]]'', March 2009</ref>\n\n===Separatist government===\n[[File:Shamil Basaev.jpg|thumb|[[Shamil Basayev]], Chechen militant [[Islamist]] and a leader of the Chechen rebel movement]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin 8 November 2000-1.jpg|thumb|[[Akhmad Kadyrov]], former separatist and [[head of the Chechen Republic]], with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]]]]\nIn addition to the Russian regional government, there was a separatist Ichkeria government that was not recognized by any state (although members have been given political asylum in European and Arab countries, as well as the United States).\n\nIchkeria is/was a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].

Aslan Maskhadov had been elected in an internationally monitored election in 1997 for 4 years, which took place after signing a peace agreement with Russia. In 2001 he issued a decree prolonging his office for one additional year; he was unable to participate in the 2003 presidential election since separatist parties were barred by the Russian government, and Maskhadov faced accusations of terrorist offenses in Russia. Maskhadov left Grozny and moved to the separatist-controlled areas of the south at the onset of the [[Second Chechen War]]. Maskhadov was unable to influence a number of warlords who retain effective control over Chechen territory, and his power was diminished as a result. Russian forces killed Maskhadov on March 8, 2005, and the assassination of Maskhadov was widely criticized since it left no legitimate Chechen separatist leader with whom to conduct peace talks. [[Akhmed Zakayev]], Deputy Prime Minister and a Foreign Minister under Maskhadov, was appointed shortly after the 1997 election and is currently living under asylum in [[England]]. He and others chose [[Abdul Khalim Saidullayev]], a relatively unknown Islamic judge who was previously the host of an Islamic program on Chechen television, to replace Maskhadov following his death. On June 17, 2006, it was reported that Russian special forces killed Abdul Khalim Saidullayev in a raid in a Chechen town Argun.\n\nThe successor of Saidullayev became [[Doku Umarov]]. On October 31, 2007, Umarov abolished the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] and its presidency and in its place proclaimed the [[Caucasian Emirate]] with himself as its [[Emir]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itstime.it/Commenti/CaucEmiri.pdf |title=What is Hidden Behind the Idea of the Caucasian Emirate? |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref> This change of status has been rejected by many Chechen politicians and military leaders who continue to support the existence of the republic.\n\n==Human rights==\n[[File:Mass grave in Chechnya.jpg|thumb|[[Mass graves in Chechnya|Mass grave in Chechnya]] (2000)]]\n\nThe Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reports that after hundreds of thousands of [[Caucasus Russians|ethnic Russians]] and Chechens fled their homes following inter-ethnic and [[Separatism|separatist]] conflicts in Chechnya in 1994 and 1999, more than 150,000 people still remain displaced in Russia today.<ref>[http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpCountrySummaries)/441ED4F5458A7C1DC125733600369629?OpenDocument&count=10000 Government efforts help only some IDPs rebuild their lives], IDMC, August 13, 2007  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821165016/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/%28httpCountrySummaries%29/441ED4F5458A7C1DC125733600369629?OpenDocument&count=10000 |date=August 21, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nOn September&nbsp;1, 1997, Criminal Code reportedly being implemented in the Chechen Republic-Ichkeriya, Article 148 punishes \"anal sexual intercourse between a man and a woman or a man and a man\".

Originally, a person was recognized as a saint without any formal process. Later, different processes were developed, such as those used today in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].\n\n== Historical development ==\nThe first persons honored as saints were the [[martyr]]s. Pious legends of their deaths were considered affirmations of the truth of their faith in [[Christ]].\n\nThe [[Roman Rite]]'s Canon of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] contains only the names of martyrs, along with that of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and, since 1962, that of [[St. Joseph]] her spouse.\n\nBy the fourth century, however, \"[[confessor]]s\"\u2014people who had confessed their faith not by dying but by word and life\u2014began to be venerated publicly. Examples of such people are Saint [[Hilarion]] and Saint [[Ephrem the Syrian]] in the East, and Saint [[Martin of Tours]] and Saint [[Hilary of Poitiers]] in the West. Their names were inserted in the [[diptych]]s, the lists of saints explicitly venerated in the [[liturgy]], and their tombs were honoured in like manner as those of the martyrs. Since the witness of their lives was not as unequivocal as that of the martyrs, they were venerated publicly only with the approval by the local [[bishop]]. This process is often referred to as \"local canonization\".{{refn|For the history of such canonization, see Kemp.{{sfnp|Kemp|1948}}}}\n\nThis approval was required even for veneration of a reputed martyr. In his history of the [[Donatism|Donatist]] [[heresy]], [[Saint Optatus]] recounts that at [[Carthage]] a Catholic matron, named Lucilla, incurred the censures of the Church for having kissed the [[relic]]s of a reputed martyr whose claims to martyrdom had not been juridically proved. And Saint [[Cyprian]] (died 258) recommended that the utmost diligence be observed in investigating the claims of those who were said to have died for the faith. All the circumstances accompanying the martyrdom were to be inquired into; the faith of those who suffered, and the motives that animated them were to be rigorously examined, in order to prevent the recognition of undeserving persons. Evidence was sought from the court records of the trials or from people who had been present at the trials.\n\nSaint [[Augustine of Hippo]] (died 430) tells of the procedure which was followed in his day for the recognition of a martyr. The bishop of the diocese in which the martyrdom took place set up a canonical process for conducting the inquiry with the utmost severity. The acts of the process were sent either to the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] or [[Primate (bishop)|primate]], who carefully examined the cause, and, after consultation with the [[suffragan]] bishops, declared whether the deceased was worthy of the name of 'martyr' and public veneration.\n\nActs of formal recognition, such as the erection of an [[altar]] over the saint's tomb or transferring the saint's relics to a church, were preceded by formal inquiries into the sanctity of the person's life and the miracles attributed to that person's intercession.\n\nSuch acts of recognition of a saint were authoritative, in the strict sense, only for the [[diocese]] or [[ecclesiastical province]] for which they were issued, but with the spread of the fame of a saint, were often accepted elsewhere also.\n\n== Anglican Communion ==\n{{main|Saints in Anglicanism}}\nThe [[Church of England]], the [[Mother Church]] of the [[Anglican Communion]], canonized [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] as a saint, in the [[Convocations of Canterbury and York]] of 1660.<ref name=\"Mitchell2012\">{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Jolyon|title=Martyrdom: A Very Short Introduction|date=29 November 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191642449|page=99|quote=In 1660 the convocations of Canterbury and York canonized King Charles.}}</ref>\n\n== Roman Catholic Church ==\n{{canon law}}\n\n=== Nature ===\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]], both [[Latin Church|Latin]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|constituent Eastern]] churches, the act of canonization is reserved to the [[Apostolic See]] and occurs at the conclusion of a long process requiring extensive proof that the candidate for canonization lived and died in such an exemplary and holy way that they are worthy to be recognized as a saint. The Church's official recognition of sanctity implies that the person is now in [[Heaven]] and that they may be publicly invoked and mentioned officially in the [[liturgy]] of the Church, including in the ''[[Litany of the Saints]]''. \n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, canonization is a decree that allows universal veneration of the saint in the [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Rite]]. For permission to venerate merely locally, only [[beatification]] is needed.<ref>\"Beatification, in the present discipline, differs from canonization in this: that the former implies (1) a locally restricted, not a universal, permission to venerate, which is (2) a mere permission, and no precept; while canonization implies a universal precept\" ([http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm Beccari, Camillo. \"Beatification and Canonization\".] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''.

Accessed 27 May 2009.).</ref>\n\n=== Procedure prior to reservation to the Apostolic See ===\n[[File:Pintoricchio 018 detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius II]] canonizes [[Catherine of Siena]]]]\n\nFor several centuries the [[Bishop]]s, or in some places only the [[primate (bishop)|Primates]] and [[Patriarch]]s,<ref>August., ''Brevic. Collat. cum Donatistis'', III, 13, no. 25 in ''PL'', XLIII, 628.</ref> could grant martyrs and confessors public ecclesiastical honor; such honor, however, was always decreed only for the local territory of which the grantors had jurisdiction. Only acceptance of the ''cultus'' by the [[Pope]] made the ''cultus'' universal, because he alone can rule the universal [[Catholic Church]].<ref>Gonzalez Tellez, ''Comm. Perpet. in singulos textus libr. Decr.'', III, xlv, in Cap. 1, ''De reliquiis et vener. Sanct.''</ref> Abuses, however, crept into this discipline, due as well to indiscretions of popular fervor as to the negligence of some bishops in inquiring into the lives of those whom they permitted to be honoured as saints.\n\nIn the Medieval West, the [[Apostolic See]] was asked to intervene in the question of canonizations so as to ensure more authoritative decisions. The canonization of [[Saint Udalric, Bishop of Augsburg]] by [[Pope John XV]] in 993 was the first undoubted example of Papal canonization of a saint from outside of [[Rome]]; some historians maintain further that the first Papal canonization was of [[St. Swibert]] by [[Pope Leo III]] in 804.\n\nThereafter, recourse to the judgment of the [[Pope]] was had more frequently. Toward the end of the eleventh century the [[Pope]]s judged it necessary to restrict episcopal authority regarding canonization, and therefore decreed that the virtues and miracles of persons proposed for public veneration should be examined in councils, more specifically in general councils. [[Pope Urban II]], [[Pope Calixtus II]], and [[Pope Eugene III]] conformed to this discipline.\n\n=== Exclusive reservation to the Apostolic See ===\n[[Hugh de Boves]], [[Archbishop of Rouen]], canonized [[Walter of Pontoise]], or St. Gaultier, in 1153, the final saint in [[Western Europe]] to be canonized by an authority other than the [[Pope]]:<ref name = \"ofsnlu\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofchri01smituoft/dictionaryofchri01smituoft_djvu.txt|title=William Smith and Samuel Cheetham, ''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities'' (Murray, 1875), p. 283.|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saint-mike.org/library/papal_library/AlexanderIII/biography.html|title=Pope Alexander III|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> \"The last case of canonization by a metropolitan is said to have been that of [[Walter of Pontoise|St. Gaultier]], or Gaucher, [A]bbot of Pontoise, by the Archbishop of Rouen.

It is alternatively quoted as follows: \"For the future you will not presume to pay him reverence, as, even though miracles were worked through him, it would not allow you to revere him as a saint unless with the authority of the Roman Church\". (C. 1, tit. cit., X, III, xlv.)</ref> Theologians disagree as to the full import of the decretal of [[Pope Alexander III]]: either a new law was instituted,<ref>St. Robert Bellarmine, ''De Eccles. Triumph.'', I, 8.</ref> in which case the [[Pope]] then for the first time reserved the right of beatification to himself, or an existing law was confirmed.\n\nHowever, the procedure initiated by the decretal of [[Pope Alexander III]] was confirmed by a [[papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope Innocent III]] issued on the occasion of the canonization of [[Cunegunda|St. Cunegunda]] in 1200. The [[Papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope Innocent III]] resulted in increasingly elaborate inquiries to the [[Apostolic See]] concerning canonizations. Because the decretal of [[Pope Alexander III]] did not end all controversy and some bishops did not obey it in so far as it regarded beatification, the right of which they had certainly possessed hitherto, [[Pope Urban VIII]] issued the Apostolic letter ''Caelestis Hierusalem cives'' of 5 July 1634 that exclusively reserved to the [[Apostolic See]] both its immemorial right of canonization and that of [[beatification]]. He further regulated both of these acts by issuing his ''Decreta servanda in beatificatione et canonizatione Sanctorum'' on 12 March 1642.\n\n=== Procedure from 1734\u201338 to 1983 ===\nIn his ''De Servorum Dei beatificatione et de Beatorum canonizatione'' of five volumes the eminent canonist Prospero Lambertini (1675-1758), who later became [[Pope Benedict XIV]], elaborated on the procedural norms of [[Pope Urban VIII|Pope Urban VIII's]] Apostolic letter ''Caelestis Hierusalem cives'' of 1634 and ''Decreta servanda in beatificatione et canonizatione Sanctorum'' of 1642, and on the conventional practice of the time. His work published from 1734\u201338 governed the proceedings until 1917. The article \"[[Beatification and canonization process in 1914]]\" describes the procedures followed until the promulgation of the ''Codex'' of 1917. The substance of ''De Servorum Dei beatif\u03b9catione et de Beatorum canonizatione'' was incorporated into the ''[[Code of Canon Law|Codex Iuris Canonici]]'' (''Code of Canon Law'') of 1917,<ref>[http://www.strasbourginstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Musoni-The-Catholic-Canonization-Process.pdf Aimable Musoni, \"Saints without Borders\", pp. 9-10.]</ref> which governed until the promulgation of the revised ''[[Code of Canon Law|Codex Iuris Canonici]]'' in 1983 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. Prior to promulgation of the revised ''Codex'' in 1983, [[Pope Paul VI|Bl.

When sufficient evidence has been collected, the local bishop presents the investigation of the candidate, who is titled \"'''Servant of God'''\" ([[Latin]]: \"'''Servus Dei'''\"), to the [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]] of the [[Roman Curia]], where the cause is assigned a [[postulator]], whose office is to collect further evidence of the life of the Servant of God. Religious orders that regularly deal with the Congregation often designate their own Postulator General. At some time, permission is then granted for the body of the Servant of God to be exhumed and examined. A certification \"''non cultus''\" is made that no superstitious or heretical worship, or improper cult of the Servant of God or his tomb has emerged, and relics are taken and preserved.\n* \"'''Venerable'''\" (\"'''Venerabilis'''\"; abbreviated \"Ven.\") or \"'''Heroic in Virtue'''\": When sufficient evidence has been collected, the Congregation recommends to the [[Pope]] that he proclaim the [[heroic virtue]] of the Servant of God; that is, that the Servant of God exercised ''to a heroic degree'' the [[theological virtues]] of faith, hope, and charity and the [[cardinal virtues]] of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. From this time the one said to be \"heroic in virtue\" is entitled \"'''[[Venerable]]'''\" ([[Latin]]: \"'''Venerabilis'''\"). A Venerable does not yet have a [[feast day]], permission to erect churches in his honor has not yet been granted, and the Church does not yet issue a statement on his probable or certain presence in [[Heaven]], but [[prayer card]]s and other materials may be printed to encourage the faithful to pray for a [[miracle]] wrought by his intercession as a sign of God's will that the person be canonized.\n* '''\"Blessed\"''' (\"'''Beatus'''\" or \"'''Beata'''\"; abbreviated \"Bl.\"): Beatification is a statement of the Church that it is \"worthy of belief\" that the Venerable is in [[Heaven]] and saved. Attaining this grade depends on whether the Venerable is a [[martyr]]:\n** For a martyr, the [[Pope]] has only to make a declaration of martyrdom, which is a certification that the Venerable gave his life voluntarily as a witness of the Faith or in an [[act of heroic charity]] for others.\n** For a non-martyr, all of them being denominated \"confessors\" because they \"confessed\", i. e., bore witness to the Faith by how they lived, proof is required of the occurrence of a [[miracle]] through the intercession of the Venerable; that is, that God granted a sign that the person is enjoying the [[Beatific Vision]] by performing a miracle for which the Venerable interceded. Presently, these miracles are almost always miraculous cures of infirmity, because these are the easiest to judge given the Church's evidentiary requirements for miracles; e. g., a patient was sick with an illness for which no cure was known; prayers were directed to the Venerable; the patient was cured; the cure was spontaneous, instantaneous, complete, and enduring; and physicians cannot discover any natural explanation therefor.\n\nThe satisfaction of the applicable conditions permits [[beatification]], which then bestows on the Venerable the title of \"'''Blessed'''\" ([[Latin]]: \"'''Beatus'''\" or \"'''Beata'''\"). A [[feast day]] will be designated, but its observance is ordinarily only permitted for the Blessed's home [[diocese]], to specific locations associated with him, or to the churches or houses of the Blessed's religious order if he belonged to one. Parishes may not normally be named in honor of beati.\n\n* '''\"Saint\"''' (\"'''Sanctus'''\" or \"'''Sancta'''\"; abbreviated \"St.\" or \"S.\"): To be canonized as a saint, ordinarily at least two miracles must have been performed through the intercession of the Blessed after his death, but for beati confessors, i. e., beati who were not declared martyrs, only one miracle is required, ordinarily being additional to that upon which beatification was premised. Very rarely, a pope may waive the requirement for a second miracle after beatification if he, the [[College of Cardinals|Sacred College of Cardinals]], and the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] all agree that the Blessed lived a life of great merit proven by certain actions. This extraordinary procedure was used in [[Pope Francis|Pope Francis']] canonization of [[Pope John XXIII]], who convoked the first part of the [[Second Vatican Council]].\n\nCanonization is a statement of the Church that the person certainly enjoys the [[Beatific Vision]] of [[Heaven]]. The title of \"'''Saint'''\" ([[Latin]]: \"'''Sanctus'''\" or \"'''Sancta'''\") is then proper, reflecting that the Saint is a refulgence of the holiness (''sanctitas'') of God Himself, which alone comes from God's gift. The Saint is assigned a [[feast day]] which ''may'' be celebrated anywhere in the universal Church, although it is not necessarily added to the [[General Roman Calendar]] or local calendars as an \"obligatory\" feast; parish churches may be erected in his honor; and the faithful may freely celebrate and honor the Saint.\n\nAlthough recognition of sainthood by the [[Pope]] does not directly concern a fact of [[Divine revelation]], nonetheless it must be \"definitively held\" by the faithful as ''infallible'' pursuant to, at the least, the [[Infallibility of the Church|Universal Magisterium of the Church]], because it is a truth related to revelation by historical necessity.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFADTU.HTM Doctrinal Commentary on the Concluding Formula of the ''Professio Fidei''], by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.</ref><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm \"Beatification and Canonization\"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Vol. 2.

P. 366.</ref>\n\nRegarding the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], individual ''[[sui juris]]'' churches have the right to \"glorify\" saints for their own jurisdictions, though this has rarely happened.\n\n=== Equipollent canonization ===\n\nPopes have several times permitted to the universal Church, without executing the ordinary judicial process of canonization described above, the veneration as a saint, the \"''[[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]]''\" of one long venerated as such locally. This act of a pope is denominated \"equipollent\" or \"equivalent canonization\" and \"confirmation of ''cultus''\". According to the rules [[Pope Benedict XIV]] (''regnat'' 17 August 1740 - 3 May 1758) instituted, there are three conditions for an equipollent canonization: (1) existence of an ancient ''cultus'' of the person, (2) a general and constant attestation to the virtues or martyrdom of the person by credible historians, and (3) uninterrupted fame of the person as a worker of miracles.\n\nAs examples, prior to his pontificate, of this mode of canonization, [[Pope Benedict XIV]] himself enumerated the equipollent canonizations of Saints:\n* [[Romuald]] in 1595,\n* [[Norbert]] in 1621,\n* [[Bruno of Cologne|Bruno]] in 1623,\n* [[Peter Nolasco]] in 1655,\n* [[Raymond Nonnatus]] in 1681,\n* [[Stephen of Hungary|King Stephen of Hungary]] in 1686,\n* [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Queen Margaret of Scotland]] in 1691,\n* [[John of Matha]] and [[Felix of Valois]] in 1694,\n* [[Pope Gregory VII]] in 1728,\n* [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Wenceslaus of Bohemia]] in 1729, and\n* [[Gertrude of Helfta]] in 1738.\n\nLater equipollent canonizations include those of Saints:\n* [[Peter Damian]] and [[Boniface]] in 1828;\n* [[Cyril and Methodius]] in 1880;\n* [[Ephrem the Syrian]] in 1920;\n* [[Albert the Great]] in 1931;\n* [[Margaret of Hungary (saint)|Margaret of Hungary]] in 1943;\n* [[John of \u00c1vila]] and [[Nikola Taveli\u0107]] and his three companion martyrs in 1970;\n* [[Marko Krizin]], [[Istv\u00e1n Pongr\u00e1cz]], and [[Melchior Grodziecki]] in 1995; and\n* [[Hildegard of Bingen]] in 2012.\n\n[[Pope Francis]] added Saints:\n* [[Angela of Foligno]]<ref>Angelo Amato, \"La canonizzazione equipollente della mistica Angela da Foligno\" in ''L'Osservatore Romano'' (12 October 2013).</ref> and [[Peter Faber]] in 2013 and\n* [[Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/04/03/pope-canonizes-jose-de-anchieta-known-as-brazil-apostle|title=Pope Canonizes Jose de Anchieta, Known as Brazil's Apostle|work=Fox News Latino|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> [[Marie of the Incarnation (Ursuline)|Marie of the Incarnation]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois de Laval|Francis-Xavier de Montmorency-Laval]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/canonize.htm|title=P.

|thumb|150px|3D structure of a&nbsp;carboxylic acid]]\n\nA '''carboxylic acid''' {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|k|\u0251r|b|\u0252|k|\u02c8|s|\u026a|l|\u026a|k}} is an [[organic compound]] that contains a '''carboxyl group''' (C(=O)OH).<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=carboxylic acids|file=C00852}}</ref> The general formula of a carboxylic acid is R\u2013COOH, with [[substituent|R referring to the rest]] of the (possibly quite large) [[molecule]].  Carboxylic acids occur widely and include the [[amino acid]]s (which make up [[protein]]s) and [[acetic acid]] (which is part of [[vinegar]] and occurs in [[metabolism]]).\n\n[[Salt (chemistry)|Salts]] and [[ester]]s of carboxylic acids are called [[carboxylate]]s. When a carboxyl group is [[deprotonate]]d, its [[conjugate base]] forms a carboxylate [[anion]]. Carboxylate ions are [[resonance-stabilized]], and this increased stability makes carboxylic acids more acidic than [[alcohol]]s, along with the [[Polar effect|electron-withrdawing]] effect of the [[Carbonyl group|carbonyl bond]], which makes the terminal oxygen-hydrogen bond weaker and thus makes acid dissociation more favorable (lowers [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]]). \n\nCarboxylic can be seen as reduced or alkylated forms of the [[Lewis acid]] [[carbon dioxide]]; under some circumstances they can be [[decarboxylation|decarboxylated]] to yield carbon dioxide.\n\n==Example carboxylic acids and nomenclature==\nCarboxylic acids are commonly identified using their [[trivial name]]s, and usually have the suffix ''-ic acid''. [[IUPAC]]-recommended names also exist; in this system, carboxylic acids have an ''-oic acid'' suffix.<ref>[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_24.htm Recommendations 1979]. Organic Chemistry IUPAC Nomenclature. Rules C-4 Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives.</ref> For example, [[butyric acid]] (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H) is butanoic acid by IUPAC guidelines. The ''-oic acid'' nomenclature detail is based on the name of the previously-known chemical [[benzoic acid]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} For nomenclature of complex molecules containing a carboxylic acid, the carboxyl can be considered position one of the [[parent chain]] even if there are other [[substituent]]s, for example, [[3-chloropropanoic acid]]. Alternately, it can be named as a \"carboxy\" or \"carboxylic acid\" substituent on another parent structure, for example, [[2-Furoic acid|2-carboxyfuran]].\n\nThe carboxylate anion (R\u2013COO<sup>\u2212</sup>) of a carboxylic acid is usually named with the suffix ''-ate'', in keeping with the general pattern of ''-ic acid'' and ''-ate'' for a [[conjugate acid]] and its conjugate base, respectively. For example, the conjugate base of [[acetic acid]] is [[acetate]].\n\n{|class = \"wikitable\"\n|+Straight-chain, saturated carboxylic acids\n!Carbon<br>atoms\n!Common name\n!IUPAC name\n!Chemical formula\n!Common location or use\n|-<!--\n|0 || [[Oxygen]] || ? || OO || [[Air]]\n|- -->\n|1 || [[Carbonic acid]] || Carbonic acid || OHCOOH || [[Blood]] and tissues ([[bicarbonate buffer system]])\n|-\n|1 || [[Formic acid]] || Methanoic acid || HCOOH || [[Insect stings]]\n|-\n|2 || [[Acetic acid]] || Ethanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>COOH || [[Vinegar]]\n|-\n|3 || [[Propionic acid]] || Propanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOH || Preservative for stored grains, [[body odour]]\n|-\n|4 || [[Butyric acid]] || Butanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>COOH || [[Butter]]\n|-\n|5 || [[Valeric acid]] || Pentanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>COOH || [[Valerian (herb)|Valerian]]\n|-\n|6 || [[Caproic acid]] || Hexanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>COOH || [[Goat]] fat\n|-\n|7 || [[Enanthic acid]] || Heptanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>COOH ||\n|-\n|8 || [[Caprylic acid]] || Octanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>COOH || [[Coconuts]]\n|-\n|9 || [[Pelargonic acid]] || Nonanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>7</sub>COOH || [[Pelargonium]]\n|-\n|10 || [[Capric acid]] || Decanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>8</sub>COOH || [[Coconut oil|Coconut]] and [[Palm kernel oil]]\n|-\n|11 || [[Undecylic acid]] || Undecanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>9</sub>COOH ||\n|-\n|12 || [[Lauric acid]] || Dodecanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>10</sub>COOH || [[Coconut oil]] and hand wash soaps\n|-\n|13 || [[Tridecylic acid]] || Tridecanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>11</sub>COOH ||\n|-\n|14 || [[Myristic acid]] || Tetradecanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>12</sub>COOH || [[Nutmeg]]\n|-\n|15 || [[Pentadecylic acid]] || Pentadecanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>13</sub>COOH ||\n|-\n|16 || [[Palmitic acid]] || Hexadecanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>14</sub>COOH || [[Palm oil]]\n|-\n|17 || [[Margaric acid]] || Heptadecanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>15</sub>COOH ||\n|-\n|18 || [[Stearic acid]] || Octadecanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>16</sub>COOH || [[Chocolate]], waxes, soaps, and oils\n|-\n|19 || [[Nonadecylic acid]] || Nonadecanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>17</sub>COOH || Fats, vegetable oils, [[pheromone]] \n|-\n|20 || [[Arachidic acid]] || Icosanoic acid || CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>18</sub>COOH || [[Peanut oil]]\n|}\n\n{|class = \"wikitable\"\n|+ Other carboxylic acids\n!

Because they are both hydrogen-bond acceptors (the carbonyl \u2013C=O) and hydrogen-bond donors (the hydroxyl \u2013OH), they also participate in [[hydrogen bond]]ing. Together the hydroxyl and carbonyl group forms the functional group carboxyl. Carboxylic acids usually exist as dimeric pairs in nonpolar media due to their tendency to \"self-associate\". Smaller carboxylic acids (1 to 5 carbons) are soluble in water, whereas higher carboxylic acids are less soluble due to the increasing hydrophobic nature of the alkyl chain. These longer chain acids tend to be rather soluble in less-polar solvents such as ethers and alcohols.<ref name=M&B>{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=R.T.|last2=Boyd|first2=R.N.|date=1992|title=Organic Chemistry|edition=6th|isbn=0-13-643669-2}}</ref>\n\n===Boiling points===\nCarboxylic acids tend to have higher boiling points than water, not only because of their increased surface area, but also because of their tendency to form stabilised dimers. Carboxylic acids tend to evaporate or boil as these dimers. For boiling to occur, either the dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporised, both of which increase the [[enthalpy of vaporization]] requirements significantly.\n\n===Acidity===\nCarboxylic acids are [[Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid-base theory|Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acids]] because they are proton (H<sup>+</sup>) donors. They are the most common type of [[organic acid]].\n\nCarboxylic acids are typically [[weak acid]]s, meaning that they only partially [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into H<sup>+</sup> [[cation]]s and RCOO<sup>\u2212</sup> [[anion]]s in neutral [[Water (molecule)|aqueous]] solution.

Each of the carbon\u2013oxygen bonds in the carboxylate anion has a partial double-bond character.\n\n===Odor===\nCarboxylic acids often have strong odors, especially the volatile derivatives. Most common are acetic acid (vinegar) and butyric acid ([[human vomit]]). Conversely [[esters]] of carboxylic acids tend to have pleasant odors and many are used in [[perfume]].\n\n==Characterization==\nCarboxylic acids are readily identified as such by [[infrared spectroscopy]]. They exhibit a sharp band associated with vibration of the C\u2013O vibration bond (''\u03bd''<sub>C=O</sub>) between 1680 and 1725&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. A characteristic ''\u03bd''<sub>O\u2013H</sub> band appears as a broad peak in the 2500 to 3000&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> region.<ref name=M&B/> By <sup>1</sup>H [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] spectrometry, the [[hydroxyl]] hydrogen appears in the 10\u201313 ppm region, although it is often either broadened or not observed owing to exchange with traces of water.\n\n==Occurrence and applications==\nMany carboxylic acids are produced industrially on a large scale. They are also pervasive in nature. Esters of fatty acids are the main components of lipids and polyamides of aminocarboxylic acids are the main components of proteins.\n\nCarboxylic acids are used in the production of polymers, pharmaceuticals, solvents, and food additives. Industrially important carboxylic acids include acetic acid (component of vinegar, precursor to solvents and coatings), [[acrylic acid|acrylic and methacrylic acids]] (precursors to polymers, adhesives), [[adipic acid]] (polymers), [[citric acid]] (beverages), [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] (chelating agent), [[fatty acid]]s (coatings), [[maleic acid]] (polymers), [[propionic acid]] (food preservative), [[terephthalic acid]] (polymers).\n\n==Synthesis==\n\n===Industrial routes===\nIn general, industrial routes to carboxylic acids differ from those used on smaller scale because they require specialized equipment.\n*Oxidation of [[aldehyde]]s with air using cobalt and manganese catalysts. The required aldehydes are readily obtained from alkenes by [[hydroformylation]].\n*Oxidation of hydrocarbons using air. For simple alkanes, this method is inexpensive but not selective enough to be useful. Allylic and benzylic compounds undergo more selective oxidations. Alkyl groups on a benzene ring are  oxidized to the carboxylic acid, regardless of its chain length. [[Benzoic acid]] from [[toluene]], [[terephthalic acid]] from ''para''-[[xylene]], and [[phthalic acid]] from ''ortho''-[[xylene]] are illustrative large-scale conversions. [[Acrylic acid]] is generated from [[propene]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Riemenschneider|first=Wilhelm|date=2002|chapter=Carboxylic Acids, Aliphatic|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a05_235}}.</ref>\n*Base-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols.\n*Carbonylation is versatile method when coupled to the addition of water. This method is effective for alkenes that generate secondary and tertiary [[carbocation]]s, e.g. [[isobutylene]] to [[pivalic acid]]. In the [[Koch reaction]], the addition of water and carbon monoxide to alkenes is catalyzed by strong acids. Acetic acid and formic acid are produced by the [[carbonylation]] of methanol, conducted with [[iodide]] and alkoxide promoters, respectively, and often with high pressures of carbon monoxide, usually involving additional hydrolytic steps. Hydrocarboxylations involve the simultaneous addition of water and [[Carbon monoxide|CO]]. Such reactions are sometimes called \"[[Walter Reppe|Reppe chemistry]]\":\n:HCCH + CO + H<sub>2</sub>O  \u2192 CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCO<sub>2</sub>H\n\n*Some long-chain carboxylic acids are obtained by the hydrolysis of [[triglyceride]]s obtained from plant or animal oils; these methods are related to [[soap making]].\n*[[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of ethanol is used in the production of [[vinegar]].\n\n===Laboratory methods===\nPreparative methods for small scale reactions for research or for production of fine chemicals often employ expensive consumable reagents.\n*[[Oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids|oxidation of primary alcohols]] or [[aldehyde]]s with strong [[Oxidizing agent|oxidants]] such as [[potassium dichromate]], [[Jones reagent]], [[potassium permanganate]], or [[sodium chlorite]].

Carboxylic acids react with [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] to form carboxylate salts, in which the hydrogen of the hydroxyl (\u2013OH) group is replaced with a metal [[cation]]. Thus, acetic acid found in vinegar reacts with [[sodium bicarbonate]] (baking soda) to form sodium acetate, [[carbon dioxide]], and water:\n:CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + NaHCO<sub>3</sub> \u2192 CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>\u2212</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nCarboxylic acids also react with [[alcohol]]s to give [[ester]]s. This process is widely used, e.g. in the production of [[polyester]]s. Likewise, carboxylic acids are converted into [[amide]]s, but this conversion typically does not occur by direct reaction of the carboxylic acid and the amine. Instead esters are typical precursors to amides. The conversion of [[amino acid]]s into [[peptide]]s is a major biochemical process that requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].\n\nThe hydroxyl group on carboxylic acids may be replaced with a chlorine atom using [[thionyl chloride]] to give [[acyl chloride]]s. In nature, carboxylic acids are converted to [[thioester]]s.\n\nCarboxylic acid can be [[carboxylic acid reduction|reduced]] to the alcohol by [[hydrogenation]] or using stoichiometric hydride reducing agents such as [[lithium aluminium hydride]].\n\n''N'',''N''-Dimethyl(chloromethylene)ammonium chloride (ClHC=N<sup>+</sup>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>) is a highly chemoselective agent for carboxylic acid reduction. It selectively activates the carboxylic acid to give the carboxymethyleneammonium salt, which can be reduced by a mild reductant like lithium tris(''t''-butoxy)aluminum hydride to afford an aldehyde in a one pot procedure.

Thus, the \u03b1-carbon is easily halogenated in the [[Hell\u2013Volhard\u2013Zelinsky halogenation]].\n* The [[Schmidt reaction]] converts carboxylic acids to [[amine]]s.\n* Carboxylic acids are decarboxylated in the [[Hunsdiecker reaction]].\n* The [[Dakin\u2013West reaction]] converts an amino acid to the corresponding amino ketone.\n* In the [[Barbier\u2013Wieland degradation]], an carboxylic acid on an aliphatic chain having a simple the [[methylene bridge]] at the alpha position can have the chain shortened by one carbon. The inverse procedure is the [[Arndt\u2013Eistert synthesis]], where an acid is converted into acyl halide, which is then reacted with [[diazomethane]] to give one additional methylene in the aliphatic chain.\n* Many acids undergo [[oxidative decarboxylation]]. [[Enzyme]]s that catalyze these reactions are known as [[carboxylase]]s ([[Enzyme Commission number|EC]]&nbsp;6.4.1) and [[decarboxylase]]s (EC&nbsp;4.1.1).\n* Carboxylic acids are reduced to [[aldehyde]]s via the [[ester]] and [[Diisobutylaluminium hydride|DIBAL]], via the acid chloride in the [[Rosenmund reduction]] and via the thioester in the [[Fukuyama reduction]].\n* In [[ketonic decarboxylation]] carboxylic acids are converted to ketones.\n* Organolithium reagents (>2 equiv) react with carboxylic acids to give a dilithium 1,1-diolate, a stable [[tetrahedral intermediate]] which decomposes to give a ketone upon acidic workup.\n* The [[Kolbe electrolysis]] is an electrolytic, decarboxylative dimerization reaction. In other words, it gets rid of the carboxyl groups of two acid molecules, and joins the remaining fragments together.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Carboxylic acids}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [[Acid anhydride]]\n* [[Acid chloride]]\n* [[Amide]]\n* [[Ester]]\n* [[List of carboxylic acids]]\n* [[Dicarboxylic acid]]\n* [[Pseudoacid]]\n* [[Thiocarboxy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|carboxyl}}\n* Carboxylic acids pH and titration [http://www2.iq.usp.br/docente/gutz/Curtipot_.html \u2013 freeware for calculations, data analysis, simulation, and distribution diagram generation]\n\n{{Functional Groups}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carboxylic Acid}}\n[[Category:Carboxylic acids| ]]\n[[Category:Functional groups]]", "sha1": "0d1kw2rppuq9ewhruwo5qywwaiixijq"}}, {"title": "Chernobyl", "ns": "0", "id": "6100", "restrictions": "move=:edit=", "revision": {"id": "866196460", "parentid": "865911391", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T22:07:49Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2600:8803:B600:9EC0:6534:BDF9:FB62:798B"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the city|the nuclear disaster|Chernobyl disaster|the nuclear power plant|Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|other uses|Chernobyl (disambiguation)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=May 2017}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2017}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name = (''in Ukrainian'') Chornobyl (\u0427\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c)<br/>(''in Russian'') Chernobyl' (\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c)\n| settlement_type = [[City of district significance (Ukraine)|City of district significance]]\n| nickname =\n| motto =\n| image_skyline = Administrative center, Radiation Control (11383715816).jpg\n| imagesize = 250\n| image_caption = Chernobyl's Old City Hall building\n| image_shield =\n| map_caption   =\n| image_map1    =\n| mapsize1      =\n| map_caption1  =\n| pushpin_map  = Ukraine Kiev Oblast#Ukraine\n| pushpin_label = Chernobyl\n| pushpin_map_caption = Location of Chernobyl in Kiev Oblast\n<!-- Location ------------------>\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = {{UKR}}\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Oblasts of Ukraine|Oblast]]\n|subdivision_name1      = {{flag|Kiev Oblast}}\n|subdivision_type2      = [[Raions of Ukraine|Raion]]\n|subdivision_name2      = [[Chernobyl Raion]] {{small|(1923\u20131988)}}<br />[[Ivankiv Raion]] {{small|(since 1988)}}\n| leader_title = Administration\n| leader_name = [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone#Administration|State Agency of Ukraine on the Exclusion Zone Management]]\n|established_title      = Founded\n|established_date       = 1193\n|established_title1     = City status\n|established_date1      = 1941\n| postal_code_type       = Postal code\n| postal_code            = 07270\n| area_code              = +380-4593\n| coordinates            = {{coord|51|16|20|N|30|13|27|E|region:UA|display=inline}}\n| elevation_m =\n| website =\n| footnotes =\n}}\n\n'''Chernobyl''' ({{IPAc-en|t\u0283|\u025c\u02d0r|\u02c8|n|o\u028a|b|\u0259l}}) is a city in the restricted [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] situated in the [[Ivankiv Raion]] of northern [[Kiev Oblast]], near Ukraine's border with [[Belarus]].

The village was granted to [[Filon Kmita]], a captain of the royal [[cavalry]], as a [[fiefdom]] in 1566. The province where Chernobyl is located was transferred to the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1569, and later annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1793.<ref name=\"ND2\">Davies, Norman (1995) \"Chernobyl\", [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/195/index.html ''The Sarmatian Review, vol. 15'', No. 1].</ref> Prior to the 20th century, Chernobyl was inhabited by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], some [[Poles|Polish]] [[peasant]]s and a relatively large number of Jews.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nJews were brought to Chernobyl by [[Filon Kmita]], during the Polish campaign of colonization. After 1596, the traditionally [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Ukrainian peasantry of the district were forcibly converted, by Poland, to the [[Greek Catholic]] Uniate religion.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Many of these converts returned to [[Eastern Orthodox]]y after the Partitions of Poland.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn 1626, during the [[Counter-reformation]], the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] church and [[monastery]] were founded by Lukasz Sapieha. A group of [[Old Catholics]] opposed the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].{{clarify|date=June 2017}} In 1832, following the failed Polish November Uprising, the Dominican monastery was sequestrated. The church of the Old Catholics was disbanded in 1852.<ref name=\"ND\" />\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, Chernobyl became a major center of [[Hasidic Judaism]]. The [[Chernobyl (Hasidic dynasty)|Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty]] had been founded by Rabbi [[Menachem Nachum Twersky]]. The Jewish population suffered greatly from [[pogrom]]s in October 1905 and in March\u2013April 1919; many Jews were killed or robbed at the instigation of the Russian nationalist [[Black Hundreds]]. When the Twersky Dynasty left Chernobyl in 1920, it ceased to exist as a centre of Hasidism.\n\nChernobyl had a population of 10,800 in 1898, including 7,200 [[Jews]]. Chernobyl was occupied in [[World War I]]{{by whom|date=June 2017}}; Ukrainians and [[Bolsheviks]] fought over the city in the ensuing [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Civil War]]. In the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1919\u201320, Chernobyl was taken first by the Polish Army and then by cavalry of the [[Red Army]]. From 1921 onwards, it was incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]].<ref name=\"ND\"/>\n\nBetween 1929 and 1933, Chernobyl suffered from killings during [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] campaign. It was also affected by the [[Holodomor|famine]] that resulted from Stalin's policies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} The Polish community of Chernobyl was deported to [[Kazakhstan]] in 1936, during the [[Frontier Clearances]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Chernobyl was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] from 25 August 1941 to 17 November 1943. The Jewish community was murdered during the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Nazi occupation of 1941\u201344]].<ref name=\"ND\" />\n\nTwenty years later, the area was chosen as the site of the first nuclear power station to be built on Ukrainian soil. The [[Duga radar|Duga]] [[over-the-horizon radar]] array, several miles outside of Chernobyl, was the origin of the [[Russian Woodpecker]]; it was designed as part of an [[anti-ballistic missile]] [[early warning radar]] network.

This was due to a lack of safety mechanisms on the reactor, which made it unstable when operated at low power.\n\nChernobyl city was evacuated soon after the disaster. The base of operations for the administration and monitoring of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was moved from Pripyat to Chernobyl. Chernobyl currently contains offices for the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone#Administration|State Agency of Ukraine on the Exclusion Zone Management]] and accommodations for visitors. Apartment blocks have been repurposed as accommodations for employees of the State Agency. The length of time that workers may spend within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is restricted by regulations that have been implemented to limit radiation exposure.\n\nThe city has become overgrown and many types of animals live there. According to census information collected over an extended period of time, it is estimated that more [[mammals]] live there now than before the disaster.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34414914 \"Wild mammals 'have returned' to Chernobyl\"] ([[BBC News]] \u2013 Science & Environment)</ref>\n\nAlthough Chernobyl will remain uninhabitable for thousands of years due to elevated levels of background radiation, guided tours of the exclusion zone are possible.\n\nIn 2003, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] launched a project, called the [[Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP)]], for the recovery of the affected areas.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070704002250/http://www.undp.org.ua/?page=projects&projects=14 CRDP: Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (United Nations Development Program)]</ref> The program, initiated in February 2002, based its activities on the Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident report recommendations.

In the HTML color list, this same color is called aqua.\n\nThe web colors are more vivid than the cyan used in the [[CMYK]] color system, and the web colors cannot be accurately reproduced on a printed page. To reproduce the web color cyan in inks, it is necessary to add some white ink to the printer's cyan below, so when it is reproduced in printing, it is not a primary subtractive color. It is called ''aqua'' (a name in use since 1598) because it is a color commonly associated with [[water]], such as the appearance of the water at a tropical beach.<ref>Maerz and Paul ''The Dictionary of Color'' 1930 (see under Aqua in Index, page 189)</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Process cyan (pigment cyan) (printer's cyan)===\n{{Infobox color\n|title=Cyan (subtractive primary)\n|hex=00B7EB\n|r=0 |g=183 |b=235\n|c=100 |m=22 |y=0 |k=8\n|h=193 |s=100 |v=92<ref>Using [[HSL color space#Conversion from RGB to HSL or HSV]], v=247/255</ref>\n|source=<!-- tintbook does not tell me any of this: --> CMYK<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tintbook.com/|title=tintbook.com|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310213952/http://www.tintbook.com/|archive-date=10 March 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} {{unreliable source?|date = November 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nCyan is also one of the common inks used in [[four-color printing]], along with [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[black]]; this set of colors is referred to as CMYK as in spectrum(s).\n\nWhile both the additive secondary and the subtractive primary are called ''cyan'', they can be substantially different from one another. Cyan printing ink can be more saturated or less saturated than the RGB secondary cyan, depending on what [[RGB color space]] and ink are considered.\n\nProcess cyan is not an RGB color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure cyan ink. This is because real-world subtractive (unlike additive) color mixing does not consistently produce the same result when mixing apparently identical colors, since the specific frequencies filtered out to produce that color affect how it interacts with other colors. [[Phthalocyanine_Blue_BN|Phthalocyanine blue]] is one such commonly used pigment.  A typical formulation of ''process cyan'' is shown in the color box at right.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==In science and nature==\n\n===Color of water===\n* Pure water is nearly colorless.

[[Nitrous oxide]], from [[whipped-cream charger]]s may also be used to make whipped cream.\n\n'''[[Sour cream]]''', common in many countries including the U.S., Canada and Australia, is cream (12 to 16% or more milk fat) that has been subjected to a [[bacteria]]l culture that produces [[lactic acid]] (0.5%+), which [[souring|sours]] and thickens it.\n\n'''[[Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche]]''' (28% milk fat) is slightly soured with bacterial culture, but not as sour or as thick as sour cream.

The process is often used in the [[semiconductor industry]] to produce [[thin film]]s.\n\nIn typical CVD, the [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] (substrate) is exposed to one or more [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[wikt:precursor|precursors]], which [[chemical reaction|react]] and/or [[chemical decomposition|decompose]] on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile [[by-product]]s are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber.\n\n[[Microfabrication]] processes widely use CVD to deposit materials in various forms, including: [[Single crystal|monocrystalline]], [[polycrystalline]], [[amorphous]], and [[Epitaxy|epitaxial]]. These materials include: [[silicon]] ([[Silicon dioxide|dioxide]], [[silicon carbide|carbide]], [[silicon nitride|nitride]], [[silicon oxynitride|oxynitride]]), carbon ([[carbon (fiber)|fiber]], [[carbon nanofibers|nanofibers]], [[carbon nanotube|nanotubes]], [[Synthetic diamond|diamond]] and [[graphene]]), [[fluorocarbon]]s, [[Electrical filament|filaments]], [[tungsten]], [[titanium nitride]] and various [[high-k dielectric]]s.\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:ThermalCVD.PNG|thumb|Hot-wall thermal CVD (batch operation type)]]\n[[File:PlasmaCVD.PNG|thumb|Plasma assisted CVD]]\n\nCVD is practiced in a variety of formats.

Temperatures between 600 and 650&nbsp;\u00b0C and pressures between 25 and 150 Pa yield a growth rate between 10 and 20 [[nanometre|nm]] per minute. An alternative process uses a [[hydrogen]]-based solution. The hydrogen reduces the growth rate, but the temperature is raised to 850 or even 1050&nbsp;\u00b0C to compensate. Polysilicon may be grown directly with doping, if gases such as [[phosphine]], [[arsine]] or [[diborane]] are added to the CVD chamber. Diborane increases the growth rate, but arsine and phosphine decrease it.\n\n=== Silicon dioxide ===\nSilicon dioxide (usually called simply \"oxide\" in the semiconductor industry) may be deposited by several different processes. Common source gases include [[silane]] and [[oxygen]], [[dichlorosilane]] (SiCl<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrous oxide]]<ref>Proceedings of the Third World Congress of Chemical Engineering, Tokyo, p. 290 (1986)</ref> (N<sub>2</sub>O), or [[tetraethylorthosilicate]] (TEOS; Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>). The reactions are as follows:<ref name=\"cao:2011\">{{cite book|last1=Cao|first1=Guozhong|last2=Wang|first2=Ying|title=Nanostructures and Nanomaterials -- Synthesis, Properties and Applications|date=2011|publisher=World Scientific Publishing|isbn=978-981-4322-50-8|page=248|doi=10.1142/7885}}</ref>\n\n:SiH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>\n\n:SiCl<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + 2 N<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 N<sub>2</sub> + 2 HCl\n\n:Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub> \u2192 SiO<sub>2</sub> + byproducts\n\nThe choice of source gas depends on the thermal stability of the substrate; for instance, [[aluminium]] is sensitive to high temperature. Silane deposits between 300 and 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, dichlorosilane at around 900&nbsp;\u00b0C, and TEOS between 650 and 750&nbsp;\u00b0C, resulting in a layer of ''low- temperature oxide'' (LTO). However, silane produces a lower-quality oxide than the other methods (lower [[dielectric strength]], for instance), and it deposits non[[conformal film|conformally]]. Any of these reactions may be used in LPCVD, but the silane reaction is also done in APCVD. CVD oxide invariably has lower quality than [[thermal oxidation|thermal oxide]], but thermal oxidation can only be used in the earliest stages of IC manufacturing.\n\nOxide may also be grown with impurities ([[alloy]]ing or \"[[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]\"). This may have two purposes. During further process steps that occur at high temperature, the impurities may [[atomic diffusion|diffuse]] from the oxide into adjacent layers (most notably silicon) and dope them. Oxides containing 5\u201315% impurities by mass are often used for this purpose. In addition, silicon dioxide alloyed with [[phosphorus pentoxide]] (\"P-glass\") can be used to smooth out uneven surfaces. P-glass softens and reflows at temperatures above 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C. This process requires a phosphorus concentration of at least 6%, but concentrations above 8% can corrode aluminium. Phosphorus is deposited from phosphine gas and oxygen:\n\n:4 PH<sub>3</sub> + 5 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>\n\n[[Glass]]es containing both boron and phosphorus (borophosphosilicate glass, BPSG) undergo viscous flow at lower temperatures; around 850&nbsp;\u00b0C is achievable with glasses containing around 5 weight % of both constituents, but stability in air can be difficult to achieve. Phosphorus oxide in high concentrations interacts with ambient moisture to produce phosphoric acid. Crystals of BPO<sub>4</sub> can also precipitate from the flowing glass on cooling; these crystals are not readily etched in the standard reactive plasmas used to pattern oxides, and will result in circuit defects in integrated circuit manufacturing.\n\nBesides these intentional impurities, CVD oxide may contain byproducts of the deposition. TEOS produces a relatively pure oxide, whereas silane introduces hydrogen impurities, and dichlorosilane introduces [[chlorine]].\n\nLower temperature deposition of silicon dioxide and doped glasses from TEOS using ozone rather than oxygen has also been explored (350 to 500&nbsp;\u00b0C). Ozone glasses have excellent conformality but tend to be hygroscopic \u2013 that is, they absorb water from the air due to the incorporation of silanol (Si-OH) in the glass. Infrared spectroscopy and mechanical strain as a function of temperature are valuable diagnostic tools for diagnosing such problems.\n\n==== Silicon nitride ====\nSilicon nitride is often used as an insulator and chemical barrier in manufacturing ICs. The following two reactions deposit silicon nitride from the gas phase:\n\n:3 SiH<sub>4</sub> + 4 NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> + 12 H<sub>2</sub>\n\n:3 SiCl<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + 4 NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> + 6 HCl + 6 H<sub>2</sub>\n\nSilicon nitride deposited by LPCVD contains up to 8% hydrogen. It also experiences strong tensile [[stress (physics)|stress]], which may crack films thicker than 200&nbsp;nm. However, it has higher [[resistivity]] and dielectric strength than most insulators commonly available in microfabrication (10<sup>16</sup> [[ohm|\u03a9]]\u00b7cm and 10 M[[volt|V]]/cm, respectively).\n\nAnother two reactions may be used in plasma to deposit SiNH:\n\n:2 SiH<sub>4</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 SiNH + 3 H<sub>2</sub>\n\n:SiH<sub>4</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 SiNH + 3 H<sub>2</sub>\n\nThese films have much less tensile stress, but worse electrical properties (resistivity 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>15</sup> \u03a9\u00b7cm, and dielectric strength 1 to 5 MV/cm).<ref>{{cite book|page = 384| title = Semiconductor devices: physics and technology|author = Sze, S.M. | publisher = Wiley-India| year = 2008|isbn =978-81-265-1681-0}}</ref>\n\n=== Metals ===\nCVD for [[tungsten]] is achieved from [[tungsten hexafluoride]] (WF<sub>6</sub>), which may be deposited in two ways:\n\n:WF<sub>6</sub> \u2192 W + 3 F<sub>2</sub>\n:WF<sub>6</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 W + 6 HF\n\nOther metals, notably aluminium and [[copper]], can be deposited by CVD. {{As of|2010}}, commercially cost-effective CVD for copper did not exist, although volatile sources exist, such as Cu([[hexafluoroacetylacetone|hfac]])<sub>2</sub>.

Scaling things down, graphene nanoribbons of less than 10 nm in width do exhibit electronic bandgaps and are therefore potential candidates for digital devices.

CVD of diamonds has received much attention in the materials sciences because it allows many new applications that had previously been considered too expensive. CVD diamond growth typically occurs under low pressure (1\u201327 [[pascal (unit)|kPa]]; 0.145\u20133.926 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]; 7.5\u2013203 [[Torr]])  and involves feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber, energizing them and providing conditions for diamond growth on the substrate. The gases always include a carbon source, and typically include hydrogen as well, though the amounts used vary greatly depending on the type of diamond being grown. Energy sources include [[hot filament]], [[microwave]] power, and [[Electric arc|arc discharges]], among others. The energy source is intended to generate a plasma in which the gases are broken down and more complex chemistries occur. The actual chemical process for diamond growth is still under study and is complicated by the very wide variety of diamond growth processes used.\n\nUsing CVD, films of diamond can be grown over large areas of substrate with control over the properties of the diamond produced. In the past, when high pressure high temperature (HPHT) techniques were used to produce a diamond, the result was typically very small free standing diamonds of varying sizes. With CVD diamond growth areas of greater than fifteen centimeters (six inches) diameter have been achieved and much larger areas are likely to be successfully coated with diamond in the future. Improving this process is key to enabling several important applications.\n\nThe growth of diamond directly on a substrate allows the addition of many of diamond's important qualities to other materials. Since diamond has the highest [[thermal conductivity]] of any bulk material, layering diamond onto high heat producing electronics (such as optics and transistors) allows the diamond to be used as a heat sink.<ref name=\"poly1\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0925-9635(94)90108-2|title=Diamond protective coatings for optical components|year=1994|last1=Costello|first1=M|last2=Tossell|first2=D|last3=Reece|first3=D|last4=Brierley|first4=C|last5=Savage|first5=J|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=3|issue=8|pages=1137\u20131141|bibcode = 1994DRM.....3.1137C }}</ref><ref name=\"heat2\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2005.05.008|title=Comparative study of thermally conductive fillers in underfill for the electronic components|year=2005|last1=Sun Lee|first1=Woong|last2=Yu|first2=Jin|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=14|issue=10|pages=1647\u20131653|bibcode = 2005DRM....14.1647S }}</ref> Diamond films are being grown on valve rings, cutting tools, and other objects that benefit from diamond's hardness and exceedingly low wear rate. In each case the diamond growth must be carefully done to achieve the necessary adhesion onto the substrate.  Diamond's very high scratch resistance and thermal conductivity, combined with a lower [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] than [[Pyrex]] glass, a [[coefficient of friction]] close to that of Teflon ([[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) and strong [[lipophilicity]] would make it a nearly ideal non-stick coating for cookware if large substrate areas could be coated economically.\n\nCVD growth allows one to control the properties of the diamond produced. In the area of diamond growth, the word \"diamond\" is used as a description of any material primarily made up of [[Orbital hybridisation#sp3|sp3-bonded]] carbon, and there are many different types of diamond included in this. By regulating the processing parameters\u2014especially the gases introduced, but also including the pressure the system is operated under, the temperature of the diamond, and the method of generating plasma\u2014many different materials that can be considered diamond can be made.

These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972.\n\nThe tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]]), a large development south of [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]] on the [[Railway Lands]], a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant by newer yards outside the city. Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; [[John Andrews (architect)|John Andrews Architects]]; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division).<ref name=\"skyscraper\" /><ref name=\"emporis\" /><ref name=\"CNTower\" />\n\nAs Toronto grew rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, multiple skyscrapers were constructed in the downtown core, most notably [[First Canadian Place]]. The reflective nature of the new buildings compromised the quality of broadcast signals necessitating new, higher antennas that were at least {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.\n\nAt the time, most data communications took place over [[Microwave#Communication|point-to-point microwave]] links, whose dish antennae covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent \"hub\" space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area.\n\nThe CN Tower can be seen from at least as far away as Kennedy Street in [[Aurora, Ontario]], approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It is also viewable to the naked eye from {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Toronto in [[Oshawa]], several points along the [[Niagara Escarpment]] west of Toronto in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south from [[Fort Niagara State Park]] in the U.S. state of [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=\"great\" /><ref name=\"CNTower\" />\n\nThe original plan for the tower envisioned a tripod consisting of three independent cylindrical \"pillars\" linked at various heights by structural bridges. Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and the SkyPod lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to the SkyPod, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.<ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite web| author=[[The Hahn Company|TrizecHahn]]| title=A Brief Overview of the CN Tower| url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/cntower/cntower_overview.html| publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]| accessdate=January 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (now named SkyPod) was not part of the plans until some time later. One engineer in particular felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. It was also some time around this point that it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest structure, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.<ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:Ripleys Aquarium Toronto map.png|thumb|left|Map showing the location of the CN Tower and nearby buildings and structures]]\nConstruction on the CN Tower began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation. By the time the foundation was complete, {{convert|56000|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} of [[soil|earth]] and [[shale]] were removed to a depth of {{convert|15|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in the centre, and a base incorporating {{convert|7000|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of concrete with {{convert|450|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on}} of [[rebar]] and {{convert|36|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on}} of [[wire rope|steel cable]] had been built to a thickness of {{convert|6.7|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}. This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.<ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\nTo create the main support pillar, workers constructed a hydraulically raised [[Slip forming|slipform]] at the base. This was a fairly unprecedented engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about {{convert|6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured continuously by a team of 1,532 people until February 22, 1974, during which it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built [[Inco Superstack]] in Sudbury, which was built using similar methods.\n\nIn total, the tower contains {{convert|40500|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form's location to massive [[plumb bob]]s hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only {{convert|29|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"CNTower\" /><ref name=\"ieee\" />\n\n[[File:CN Tower40 construction skycrane March 1975 01c.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Skycrane \"Olga\" lifting antenna segment]]\nIn August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.<ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\nThe antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but during construction the [[Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane]] helicopter became available when the [[United States Army]] sold one to civilian operators. The helicopter, named \"Olga\", was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections.\n\nThe flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in the local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped-off on April 2, 1975, after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from [[Moscow]]'s [[Ostankino Tower]], and bringing the total mass to {{convert|118000|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.\n\nTwo years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that \"All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,\" and that \"Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.\"<ref>{{cite book| last=Fulford| first=Robert| date=March 13, 1996| title=Accidental city: the transformation of Toronto| publisher=MacFarlane, Walter & Ross| page=32| isbn=978-0395773079}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Phases of construction ====\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"135px\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:CN Tower footings 1973.jpg|Constructing the base, July 1973\nFile:Cntower1974.jpg|Brackets being raised, August 1974\nFile:CN Tower50 construction skycrane March 1975 01d.jpg|Helicopter lifting part of antenna, March 1975\nFile:CN Tower under construction (April 1975).jpg|Main pod construction, April 1975\nFile:CN Tower under construction.jpg|Nearing completion, December 1975\nFile:CN Tower 1976.jpg|Two months after opening, August 1976\n</gallery>\n\n==== Architects ====\n*[[WZMH Architects]]\n*[[John Andrews (architect)|John Hamilton Andrews]]\n*Webb Zerafa\n*Menkes Housden with the help of E.R.

[[Canadian National Railway]] sold the tower prior to taking the company private in 1995, when it decided to divest all operations not directly related to its core freight shipping businesses.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the CN Tower was practically the only development along Front Street West; it was still possible to see Lake Ontario from the foot of the CN Tower due to the expansive parking lots and lack of development in the area at the time. As the area around the tower was developed, particularly with the completion of the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]] in 1984 and the SkyDome in 1989 (renamed [[Rogers Centre]] in 2005), the former [[Railway Lands]] were redeveloped and the tower became the centre of a newly developing entertainment area. Access was greatly improved with the construction of the [[SkyWalk]] in 1989, which connected the tower and SkyDome to the nearby [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] railway and subway station,  and, in turn, to the city's [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] underground pedestrian system. By the mid-1990s, it was the centre of a thriving tourist district. The entire area continues to be an area of intense building, notably a [[Manhattanization|boom]] in [[condominium]] construction in the first two decades of the 21st century, as well as the 2013 opening of the [[Ripley's Aquarium of Canada|Ripley's Aquarium]] by the base of the tower.<ref name=\"great\"/><ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\n== Events ==\n[[File:2015 Toronto Pan American Games-Laslovarga.jpeg|thumb|right|Fireworks display on the CN Tower during [[2015 Pan American Games opening ceremony|the opening ceremony]] of the [[2015 Pan American Games]].]]\n*While still under construction, the CN Tower officially became the world's tallest free-standing structure on March 31, 1975.<ref name=records/>\n*When the CN Tower opened in 1976, there were three public observation points: the SkyPod (then known as the Space Deck) that stands at {{convert|447|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the Indoor Observation Level (later named Indoor Lookout Level) at {{convert|346|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the Outdoor Observation Terrace (at the same level as the Glass Floor) at {{convert|342|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"great\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/> One floor above the Indoor Observation Level was the Top of Toronto Restaurant, which completed a revolution once every 72 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |title=General Information |url=https://www.cntower.ca/site_Files/Content/PDF/Press_Kit/CN_Tower_General_Information_2013_Revised.pdf |publisher=CN Tower |date=2013}}</ref>\n*Stuntman [[Dar Robinson]] jumped off of the CN Tower on two occasions in 1979 and 1980.

The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the [[Stairs|stairwells]] and power and plumbing connections. The Tower's six [[elevator]]s are located in the three inverted angles created by the Tower's hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way through the Tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the Tower; the Tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the Tower is a {{convert|102|m|ft|1|adj=on}} tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying TV and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: the Glass Floor and Outdoor Observation Terrace which are both located at an elevation of {{convert|342|m|ft|0}}, the Indoor Lookout Level (formerly known as \"Indoor Observation Level\") located at {{convert|346|m|ft|0}}, and the higher SkyPod (formerly known as \"Space Deck\") at {{convert|446.5|m|ft|0}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21 |title=CN Tower |accessdate=April 9, 2008 |work=SkyscraperPage.com |publisher=Skyscraper Source Media |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406071501/http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21 |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> just below the metal [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The hexagonal shape can be seen between the two areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large [[tripod]].\n\nThe main deck level is seven storeys, some of which are open to the public. Below the public areas \u2014 at {{convert|338|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} \u2014 is a large white donut-shaped [[radome]] containing the structure's microwave receivers. The [[glass floor]] and outdoor observation deck are at {{convert|342|m|ft|1}}. The glass floor has an area of {{convert|24|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} and can withstand a pressure of {{convert|4100|kPa|psi|0|lk=on}}.

That is, if ''f'' and ''g'' are functions, then the chain rule expresses the derivative of their composition {{math|''f'' {{large|\u2218}} ''g''}} (the function which maps ''x'' to ''f''(''g''(''x'')) ) in terms of the derivatives of ''f'' and ''g'' and the [[pointwise product|product of functions]] as follows:\n\n:<math>(f\\circ g)'=(f'\\circ g)\\cdot g'.</math>\n\nThis may equivalently be expressed in terms of the variable. Let {{math|1=''F'' = ''f'' {{large|\u2218}} ''g''}}, or equivalently, {{math|1=''F''(''x'') = ''f''(''g''(''x''))}} for all ''x''. Then one can also write\n:<math>F'(x) = f'(g(x)) g'(x).</math>\n\nThe chain rule may be written in [[Leibniz's notation]] in the following way. If a variable ''z'' depends on the variable ''y'', which itself depends on the variable ''x'', so that ''y'' and ''z'' are therefore [[dependent variable]]s, then ''z'', via the intermediate variable of ''y'', depends on ''x'' as well.  The chain rule then states,\n\n:<math>\\frac{dz}{dx} = \\frac{dz}{dy} \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dx}. </math>\n\nThe two versions of the chain rule are related; if <math>z=f(y)</math> and <math>y=g(x)</math>, then\n\n:<math>\\frac{dz}{dx}=\\frac{dz}{dy}\\cdot\\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(y)g'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x).</math>\n\nIn [[integral|integration]], the counterpart to the chain rule is the [[substitution rule]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe chain rule seems to have first been used by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. He used it to calculate the derivative of <math>\\sqrt{a + bz + cz^2}</math> as the composite of the square root function and the function <math>a + bz + cz^2</math>.  He first mentioned it in a 1676 memoir (with a sign error in the calculation). The common notation of chain rule is due to Leibniz.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A Semiotic Reflection on the Didactics of the Chain Rule|journal=The Montana Mathematics Enthusiast|year=2010|volume=7|pages=321\u2013332|url=http://www.math.umt.edu/tmme/vol7no2and3/9_RodriguezFernandez_TMMEvol7nos2and3_pp.321_332.pdf|issn= 1551-3440|issue=2\u20133\n|author=Omar Hern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u00edguez and Jorge M. L\u00f3pez Fern\u00e1ndez\n}}</ref> [[Guillaume de l'H\u00f4pital]] used the chain rule implicitly in his ''[[Analyse des infiniment petits]]''. The chain rule does not appear in any of [[Leonhard Euler]]'s analysis books, even though they were written over a hundred years after Leibniz's discovery.\n\n== One dimension ==\n\n=== First example ===\nSuppose that a skydiver jumps from an aircraft.  Assume that ''t'' seconds after his jump, his height above sea level in meters is given by {{math|1=''g''(''t'') = 4000 \u2212 4.9''t''<sup>2</sup>}}.  One model for the [[atmospheric pressure]] at a height ''h'' is {{math|1=''f''(''h'') = {{gaps|101|325}} ''e''<sup>\u22120.0001''h''</sup>}}.  These two equations can be differentiated and combined in various ways to produce the following data:\n* {{math|1=''g''\u2032(''t'') = \u22129.8''t''}} is the velocity of the skydiver at time ''t''.\n* {{math|1=''f''\u2032(''h'') = \u221210.1325''e''<sup>\u22120.0001''h''</sup>}} is the rate of change in atmospheric pressure with respect to height at the height ''h'' and is proportional to the [[buoyancy|buoyant force]] on the skydiver at ''h'' meters above sea level.  (The true buoyant force depends on the volume of the skydiver.)\n* {{math|(''f'' \u2218 ''g'')(''t'')}} is the atmospheric pressure the skydiver experiences ''t'' seconds after his jump.\n* {{math|(''f'' \u2218 ''g'')\u2032(''t'')}} is the rate of change in atmospheric pressure with respect to time at ''t'' seconds after the skydiver's jump and is proportional to the buoyant force on the skydiver at ''t'' seconds after his jump.\nThe chain rule gives a method for computing {{math|(''f'' \u2218 ''g'')\u2032(''t'')}} in terms of {{math|''f''\u2032}} and {{math|''g''\u2032}}.  While it is always possible to directly apply the definition of the derivative to compute the derivative of a composite function, this is usually very difficult.  The utility of the chain rule is that it turns a complicated derivative into several easy derivatives.\n\nThe chain rule states that, under appropriate conditions,\n:<math>(f \\circ g)'(t) = f'(g(t))\\cdot g'(t).</math>\nIn this example, this equals\n:<math>(f \\circ g)'(t) = \\big(\\mathord{-}10.1325e^{-0.0001(4000 - 4.9t^2)}\\big)\\cdot\\big(\\mathord{-}9.8t\\big).</math>\n\nIn the statement of the chain rule, ''f'' and ''g'' play slightly different roles because ''f''\u2032 is evaluated at ''g''(''t'') whereas ''g''\u2032 is evaluated at ''t''.  This is necessary to make the units work out correctly.  For example, suppose that we want to compute the rate of change in atmospheric pressure ten seconds after the skydiver jumps.  This is {{math|(''f'' \u2218 ''g'')\u2032(10)}} and has units of [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]] per second.  The factor ''g''\u2032(10) in the chain rule is the velocity of the skydiver ten seconds after his jump, and it is expressed in meters per second.  ''f''\u2032(''g''(10)) is the change in pressure with respect to height at the height ''g''(10) and is expressed in pascals per meter.  The product of ''f''\u2032(''g''(10)) and ''g''\u2032(10) therefore has the correct units of pascals per second.  It is not possible to evaluate ''f'' anywhere else.  For instance, because the 10 in the problem represents ten seconds, the expression ''f''\u2032(10) represents the change in pressure at a height of ten seconds, which is nonsense.  Similarly, because {{math|1=''g''\u2032(10) = \u221298}} meters per second, the expression ''f''\u2032(''g''\u2032(10)) represents the change in pressure at a height of \u221298 meters per second, which is also nonsense.  However, ''g''(10) is 3020 meters above sea level, the height of the skydiver ten seconds after his jump.  This has the correct units for an input to ''f''.\n\n=== Statement ===\n\nThe simplest form of the chain rule is for real-valued functions of one [[real number|real]] variable.  It says that if ''g'' is a function that is differentiable at a point ''c'' (i.e.&nbsp;the derivative ''g''\u2032(''c'') exists) and ''f'' is a function that is differentiable at ''g''(''c''), then the composite function {{math|''f''&nbsp;\u2218&nbsp;''g''}} is differentiable at ''c'', and the derivative is<ref>{{cite book|title=Mathematical analysis|authorlink=Tom Apostol|first=Tom|last=Apostol|year=1974|edition=2nd|publisher=Addison Wesley|page=Theorem 5.5|nopp=true}}</ref>\n\n:<math> (f\\circ g)'(c) = f'(g(c))\\cdot g'(c). </math>\n\nThe rule is sometimes abbreviated as\n\n:<math>(f\\circ g)' = (f'\\circ g) \\cdot g'.</math>\n\nIf {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''u'')}} and {{math|1=''u'' = ''g''(''x'')}}, then this abbreviated form is written in [[Leibniz notation]] as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dx}.</math>\n\nThe points where the derivatives are evaluated may also be stated explicitly:\n\n:<math>\\left.\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right|_{x=c} = \\left.\\frac{dy}{du}\\right|_{u = g(c)} \\cdot \\left.\\frac{du}{dx}\\right|_{x=c}.</math>\n\n=== Further examples ===\n\n==== Absence of formulas ====\nIt may be possible to apply the chain rule even when there are no formulas for the functions which are being differentiated.  This can happen when the derivatives are measured directly.  Suppose that a car is driving up a tall mountain.  The car's speedometer measures its speed directly.  If the [[grade (slope)|grade]] is known, then the rate of ascent can be calculated using [[trigonometry]].  Suppose that the car is ascending at {{val|2.5|u=km/h}}.  Standard models for the Earth's atmosphere imply that the temperature drops about {{val|6.5|u=\u00b0C}} per kilometer ascended (called the [[lapse rate]]).  To find the temperature drop per hour, we apply the chain rule.  Let the function {{math|''g''(''t'')}} be the altitude of the car at time {{mvar|t}}, and let the function {{math|''f''(''h'')}} be the temperature {{mvar|h}} kilometers above sea level.  {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are not known exactly: For example, the altitude where the car starts is not known and the temperature on the mountain is not known.  However, their derivatives are known: {{math|''f''\u2032}} is {{val|\u22126.5|u=\u00b0C/km}}, and {{math|''g''\u2032}} is {{val|2.5|u=km/h}}.  The chain rule says that the derivative of the composite function is the product of the derivative of {{mvar|f}} and the derivative of {{mvar|g}}.  This is {{math|{{val|\u22126.5|u=\u00b0C/km}} \u22c5 {{val|2.5|u=km/h}} {{=}} {{val|\u221216.25|u=\u00b0C/h}}}}.\n\nOne of the reasons why this computation is possible is because {{math|''f''\u2032}} is a constant function.  This is because the above model is very simple.  A more accurate description of how the temperature near the car varies over time would require an accurate model of how the temperature varies at different altitudes.  This model may not have a constant derivative.  To compute the temperature change in such a model, it would be necessary to know {{mvar|g}} and not just {{math|''g''\u2032}}, because without knowing {{mvar|g}} it is not possible to know where to evaluate {{math|''f''\u2032}}.\n\n==== Composites of more than two functions ====\nThe chain rule can be applied to composites of more than two functions.  To take the derivative of a composite of more than two functions, notice that the composite of ''f'', ''g'', and ''h'' (in that order) is the composite of ''f'' with {{math|''g'' \u2218 ''h''}}.  The chain rule says that to compute the derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2218 ''g'' \u2218 ''h''}}, it is sufficient to compute the derivative of ''f'' and the derivative of {{math|''g'' \u2218 ''h''}}.  The derivative of ''f'' can be calculated directly, and the derivative of {{math|''g'' \u2218 ''h''}} can be calculated by applying the chain rule again.\n\nFor concreteness, consider the function\n:<math>y = e^{\\sin (x^2)}.</math>\nThis can be decomposed as the composite of three functions:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ny &= f(u) = e^u, \\\\[6pt]\nu &= g(v) = \\sin v = \\sin(x^2), \\\\[6pt]\nv &= h(x) = x^2.\n\\end{align}</math>\nTheir derivatives are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dy}{du} &= f'(u) = e^u = e^{\\sin(x^2)}, \\\\[6pt]\n\\frac{du}{dv} &= g'(v) = \\cos v = \\cos(x^2), \\\\[6pt]\n\\frac{dv}{dx} &= h'(x) = 2x.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe chain rule says that the derivative of their composite at the point {{math|1=''x'' = ''a''}} is:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n(f \\circ g \\circ h)'(a) & = f'((g \\circ h)(a))\\cdot (g \\circ h)'(a) \\\\[10pt]\n& = f'((g \\circ h)(a)) \\cdot g'(h(a)) \\cdot h'(a) = (f' \\circ g \\circ h)(a) \\cdot (g' \\circ h)(a) \\cdot h'(a).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIn Leibniz notation, this is:\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\left.\\frac{dy}{du}\\right|_{u=g(h(a))}\\cdot\\left.\\frac{du}{dv}\\right|_{v=h(a)}\\cdot\\left.\\frac{dv}{dx}\\right|_{x=a},</math>\nor for short,\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du}\\cdot\\frac{du}{dv}\\cdot\\frac{dv}{dx}.</math>\nThe derivative function is therefore:\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{\\sin(x^2)}\\cdot\\cos(x^2)\\cdot 2x.</math>\n\nAnother way of computing this derivative is to view the composite function {{math|''f'' \u2218 ''g'' \u2218 ''h''}} as the composite of {{math|''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} and ''h''.  Applying the chain rule to this situation gives:\n:<math>(f \\circ g \\circ h)'(a) = (f \\circ g)'(h(a))\\cdot h'(a) = f'(g(h(a)))\\cdot g'(h(a))\\cdot h'(a).</math>\nThis is the same as what was computed above.  This should be expected because {{math|1=(''f'' \u2218 ''g'') \u2218 ''h'' = ''f'' \u2218 (''g'' \u2218 ''h'')}}.\n\nSometimes it is necessary to differentiate an arbitrarily long composition of the form <math>f_1 \\circ f_2 \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{n-1} \\circ f_n</math>. In this case, define\n:<math>f_{a\\,.\\,.\\,b} = f_{a} \\circ f_{a+1} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{b-1} \\circ f_{b}</math>\nwhere <math>f_{a\\,.\\,.\\,a} = f_a</math> and <math>f_{a\\,.\\,.\\,b}(x) = x</math> when <math>b < a</math>. Then the chain rule takes the form\n:<math>Df_{1\\,.\\,.\\,n} = (Df_1 \\circ f_{2\\,.\\,.\\,n}) (Df_2 \\circ f_{3\\,.\\,.\\,n}) \\cdots (Df_{n-1} \\circ f_{n\\,.\\,.\\,n}) Df_n = \\prod_{k=1}^n \\left[Df_k \\circ f_{(k+1)\\,.\\,.\\,n}\\right]</math>\nor, in the Lagrange notation,\n:<math>f_{1\\,.\\,.\\,n}'(x) = f_1' \\left( f_{2\\,.\\,.\\,n}(x) \\right) \\; f_2' \\left( f_{3\\,.\\,.\\,n}(x) \\right) \\cdots f_{n-1}' \\left(f_{n\\,.\\,.\\,n}(x)\\right) \\; f_n'(x) = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} f_k' \\left(f_{(k+1\\,.\\,.\\,n)}(x) \\right)</math>\n\n==== Quotient rule ====\n{{See also|Quotient rule}}\nThe chain rule can be used to derive some well-known differentiation rules.  For example, the quotient rule is a consequence of the chain rule and the [[product rule]].  To see this, write the function ''f''(''x'')/''g''(''x'') as the product {{math|''f''(''x'') \u00b7 1/''g''(''x'')}}.  First apply the product rule:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right)\n&= \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(f(x)\\cdot\\frac{1}{g(x)}\\right) \\\\\n&= f'(x)\\cdot\\frac{1}{g(x)} + f(x)\\cdot\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{g(x)}\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\nTo compute the derivative of 1/''g''(''x''), notice that it is the composite of ''g'' with the reciprocal function, that is, the function that sends ''x'' to 1/''x''.  The derivative of the reciprocal function is \u22121/''x''<sup>2</sup>.  By applying the chain rule, the last expression becomes:\n:<math>f'(x)\\cdot\\frac{1}{g(x)} + f(x)\\cdot\\left(-\\frac{1}{g(x)^2}\\cdot g'(x)\\right)\n= \\frac{f'(x) g(x) - f(x) g'(x)}{g(x)^2},</math>\nwhich is the usual formula for the quotient rule.\n\n==== Derivatives of inverse functions ====\n{{Main|Inverse functions and differentiation}}\nSuppose that {{math|1=''y'' = ''g''(''x'')}} has an [[inverse function]].  Call its inverse function ''f'' so that we have {{math|1=''x'' = ''f''(''y'')}}.  There is a formula for the derivative of ''f'' in terms of the derivative of ''g''.  To see this, note that ''f'' and ''g'' satisfy the formula\n:<math>f(g(x)) = x.</math>\nBecause the functions ''f''(''g''(''x'')) and ''x'' are equal, their derivatives must be equal.  The derivative of ''x'' is the constant function with value 1, and the derivative of ''f''(''g''(''x'')) is determined by the chain rule.  Therefore, we have:\n:<math>f'(g(x)) g'(x) = 1.</math>\nTo express ''f''\u2032 as a function of an independent variable ''y'', we substitute ''f''(''y'') for ''x'' wherever it appears.  Then we can solve for ''f''\u2032.\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nf'(g(f(y))) g'(f(y)) &= 1 \\\\[5pt]\nf'(y) g'(f(y)) &= 1 \\\\[5pt]\nf'(y) = \\frac{1}{g'(f(y))}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor example, consider the function {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}.  It has an inverse {{math|1=''f''(''y'') = ln ''y''}}.  Because {{math|1=''g''\u2032(''x'') = ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}, the above formula says that\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dy}\\ln y = \\frac{1}{e^{\\ln y}} = \\frac{1}{y}.</math>\n\nThis formula is true whenever ''g'' is differentiable and its inverse ''f'' is also differentiable.  This formula can fail when one of these conditions is not true.  For example, consider {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>3</sup>}}.  Its inverse is {{math|1=''f''(''y'') = ''y''<sup>1/3</sup>}}, which is not differentiable at zero.  If we attempt to use the above formula to compute the derivative of ''f'' at zero, then we must evaluate 1/''g''\u2032(''f''(0)).  {{math|1=''f''(0) = 0}} and {{math|1=''g''\u2032(0) = 0}}, so we must evaluate 1/0, which is undefined.  Therefore, the formula fails in this case.  This is not surprising because ''f'' is not differentiable at zero.\n\n=== Higher derivatives ===\n[[Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula]] generalizes the chain rule to higher derivatives.  Assuming that {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''u'')}} and {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''g''(''x'')}}, then the first few derivatives are:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dy}{dx} & = \\frac{dy}{du} \\frac{du}{dx} \\\\[4pt]\n\\frac{d^2 y }{d x^2} & = \\frac{d^2 y}{d u^2} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2\n    + \\frac{dy}{du} \\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} \\\\[4pt]\n\\frac{d^3 y }{d x^3} & = \\frac{d^3 y}{d u^3} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^3\n    + 3 \\, \\frac{d^2 y}{d u^2} \\frac{du}{dx} \\frac{d^2 u}{d x^2}\n    + \\frac{dy}{du} \\frac{d^3 u}{d x^3} \\\\[4pt]\n\\frac{d^4 y}{d x^4} & =\\frac{d^4 y}{du^4} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^4\n    + 6 \\, \\frac{d^3 y}{d u^3} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 \\frac{d^2 u}{d x^2}\n    + \\frac{d^2 y}{d u^2} \\left( 4 \\, \\frac{du}{dx} \\frac{d^3 u}{dx^3}\n    + 3 \\, \\left(\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2}\\right)^2\\right)\n    + \\frac{dy}{du} \\frac{d^4 u}{dx^4}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n=== Proofs ===\n\n==== First proof ====\nOne proof of the chain rule begins with the definition of the derivative:\n:<math>(f \\circ g)'(a) = \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x - a}.</math>\nAssume for the moment that ''g''(''x'') does not equal ''g''(''a'') for any ''x'' near ''a''.  Then the previous expression is equal to the product of two factors:\n:<math>\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{g(x) - g(a)} \\cdot \\frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x - a}.</math>\nWhen ''g'' oscillates near ''a'', then it might happen that no matter how close one gets to ''a'', there is always an even closer ''x'' such that ''g''(''x'') equals ''g''(''a'').  For example, this happens for {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup>sin(1 / ''x'')}} near the point {{math|1=''a'' = 0}}.  Whenever this happens, the above expression is undefined because it involves [[division by zero]].  To work around this, introduce a function ''Q'' as follows:\n:<math>Q(y) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{f(y) - f(g(a))}{y - g(a)}, & y \\neq g(a), \\\\\nf'(g(a)), & y = g(a).\n\\end{cases}</math>\nWe will show that the [[difference quotient]] for {{math|''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} is always equal to:\n:<math>Q(g(x)) \\cdot \\frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x - a}.</math>\nWhenever ''g''(''x'') is not equal to ''g''(''a''), this is clear because the factors of {{math|''g''(''x'') \u2212 ''g''(''a'')}} cancel.  When ''g''(''x'') equals ''g''(''a''), then the difference quotient for {{math|''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} is zero because ''f''(''g''(''x'')) equals ''f''(''g''(''a'')), and the above product is zero because it equals ''f''\u2032(''g''(''a'')) times zero.  So the above product is always equal to the difference quotient, and to show that the derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} at ''a'' exists and to determine its value, we need only show that the limit as ''x'' goes to ''a'' of the above product exists and determine its value.\n\nTo do this, recall that the limit of a product exists if the limits of its factors exist.  When this happens, the limit of the product of these two factors will equal the product of the limits of the factors.  The two factors are ''Q''(''g''(''x'')) and {{math|(''g''(''x'') \u2212 ''g''(''a'')) / (''x'' \u2212 ''a'')}}.  The latter is the difference quotient for ''g'' at ''a'', and because ''g'' is differentiable at ''a'' by assumption, its limit as ''x'' tends to ''a'' exists and equals ''g''\u2032(''a'').\n\nIt remains to study ''Q''(''g''(''x'')).  ''Q'' is defined wherever ''f'' is.  Furthermore, because ''f'' is differentiable at ''g''(''a'') by assumption, ''Q'' is continuous at ''g''(''a'').  ''g'' is continuous at ''a'' because it is differentiable at ''a'', and therefore {{math|''Q'' \u2218 ''g''}} is continuous at ''a''.  So its limit as ''x'' goes to ''a'' exists and equals ''Q''(''g''(''a'')), which is ''f''\u2032(''g''(''a'')).\n\nThis shows that the limits of both factors exist and that they equal ''f''\u2032(''g''(''a'')) and ''g''\u2032(''a''), respectively.  Therefore, the derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} at ''a'' exists and equals ''f''\u2032(''g''(''a''))''g''\u2032(''a'').\n\n==== Second proof ====\nAnother way of proving the chain rule is to measure the error in the linear approximation determined by the derivative.  This proof has the advantage that it generalizes to several variables.  It relies on the following equivalent definition of differentiability at a point: A function ''g'' is differentiable at ''a'' if there exists a real number ''g''\u2032(''a'') and a function ''\u03b5''(''h'') that tends to zero as ''h'' tends to zero, and furthermore\n:<math>g(a + h) - g(a) = g'(a) h + \\varepsilon(h) h.</math>\nHere the left-hand side represents the true difference between the value of ''g'' at ''a'' and at {{math|''a'' + ''h''}}, whereas the right-hand side represents the approximation determined by the derivative plus an error term.\n\nIn the situation of the chain rule, such a function ''\u03b5'' exists because ''g'' is assumed to be differentiable at ''a''.  Again by assumption, a similar function also exists for ''f'' at ''g''(''a'').  Calling this function ''\u03b7'', we have\n:<math>f(g(a) + k) - f(g(a)) = f'(g(a)) k + \\eta(k) k.</math>\nThe above definition imposes no constraints on ''\u03b7''(0), even though it is assumed that ''\u03b7''(''k'') tends to zero as ''k'' tends to zero.  If we set {{math|1=''\u03b7''(0) = 0}}, then ''\u03b7'' is continuous at 0.\n\nProving the theorem requires studying the difference {{math|''f''(''g''(''a'' + ''h'')) \u2212 ''f''(''g''(''a''))}} as ''h'' tends to zero.  The first step is to substitute for {{math|''g''(''a'' + ''h'')}} using the definition of differentiability of ''g'' at ''a'':\n:<math>f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a)) = f(g(a) + g'(a) h + \\varepsilon(h) h) - f(g(a)).</math>\nThe next step is to use the definition of differentiability of ''f'' at ''g''(''a'').  This requires a term of the form {{math|''f''(''g''(''a'') + ''k'')}} for some ''k''.  In the above equation, the correct ''k'' varies with ''h''.  Set {{math|1=''k''<sub>''h''</sub> = ''g''\u2032(''a'') ''h'' + ''\u03b5''(''h'') ''h''}} and the right hand side becomes {{math|''f''(''g''(''a'') + ''k''<sub>''h''</sub>) \u2212 ''f''(''g''(''a''))}}.  Applying the definition of the derivative gives:\n:<math>f(g(a) + k_h) - f(g(a)) = f'(g(a)) k_h + \\eta(k_h) k_h.</math>\nTo study the behavior of this expression as ''h'' tends to zero, expand ''k''<sub>''h''</sub>. After regrouping the terms, the right-hand side becomes:\n:<math>f'(g(a)) g'(a)h + [f'(g(a)) \\varepsilon(h) + \\eta(k_h) g'(a) + \\eta(k_h) \\varepsilon(h)] h.</math>\nBecause ''\u03b5''(''h'') and ''\u03b7''(''k''<sub>''h''</sub>) tend to zero as ''h'' tends to zero, the first two bracketed terms tend to zero as ''h'' tends to zero.  Applying the same theorem on products of limits as in the first proof, the third bracketed term also tends zero.  Because the above expression is equal to the difference {{math|''f''(''g''(''a'' + ''h'')) \u2212 ''f''(''g''(''a''))}}, by the definition of the derivative {{math|''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} is differentiable at ''a'' and its derivative is {{math|''f''\u2032(''g''(''a'')) ''g''\u2032(''a'').}}\n\nThe role of ''Q'' in the first proof is played by ''\u03b7'' in this proof.  They are related by the equation:\n:<math>Q(y) = f'(g(a)) + \\eta(y - g(a)). </math>\nThe need to define ''Q'' at ''g''(''a'') is analogous to the need to define ''\u03b7'' at zero.\n\n==== Third proof ====\n[[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory]]'s alternative definition of the differentiability of a function can be used to give an elegant proof of the chain rule.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Stephen|last=Kuhn|title=The Derivative \u00e1 la Carath\u00e9odory|journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]]|year=1991|volume=98|issue=1|pages=40\u201344|jstor=2324035}}</ref>\n\nUnder this definition, a function {{mvar|f}} is differentiable at a point {{mvar|a}} if and only if there is a function {{mvar|q}}, continuous at {{mvar|a}} and such that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') \u2212 ''f''(''a'') = ''q''(''x'')(''x'' \u2212 ''a'')}}. There is at most one such function, and if {{mvar|f}} is differentiable at {{mvar|a}} then {{math|1=''f'' '(''a'') = ''q''(''a'')}}.\n\nGiven the assumptions of the chain rule and the fact that differentiable functions and compositions of continuous functions are continuous, we have that there exist functions {{mvar|q}}, continuous at {{math|''g''(''a'')}} and {{mvar|r}}, continuous at {{mvar|a}} and such that,\n:<math>f(g(x))-f(g(a))=q(g(x))(g(x)-g(a))</math>\nand\n:<math>g(x)-g(a)=r(x)(x-a).</math>\nTherefore,\n:<math>f(g(x))-f(g(a))=q(g(x))r(x)(x-a),</math>\nbut the function given by {{math|1=''h''(''x'') = ''q''(''g''(''x''))''r''(''x'')}} is continuous at {{mvar|a}}, and we get, for this {{mvar|a}}\n:<math>(f(g(a)))'=q(g(a))r(a)=f'(g(a))g'(a).</math>\nA similar approach works for continuously differentiable (vector-)functions of many variables. This method of factoring also allows a unified approach to stronger forms of differentiability, when the derivative is required to be [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]], [[H\u00f6lder condition|H\u00f6lder continuous]], etc. Differentiation itself can be viewed as the [[polynomial remainder theorem]] (the little [[\u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout|B\u00e9zout]] theorem, or factor theorem), generalized to an appropriate class of functions. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==== Proof via infinitesimals ====\nIf <math>y=f(x)</math> and <math>x=g(t)</math> then choosing infinitesimal <math>\\Delta t\\not=0</math> we compute the corresponding <math>\\Delta x=g(t+\\Delta t)-g(t)</math> and then the corresponding <math>\\Delta y=f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)</math>, so that\n:<math>\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}</math>\nand applying the [[standard part]] we obtain\n:<math>\\frac{d y}{d t}=\\frac{d y}{d x} \\frac{dx}{dt}</math>\nwhich is the chain rule.\n\n== Higher dimensions ==\nThe simplest generalization of the chain rule to higher dimensions uses the [[Total derivative#The total derivative as a linear map|total derivative]]. The total derivative is a linear transformation that captures how the function changes in all directions.  Fix differentiable functions {{math|''f'' : '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''k''</sup>}} and {{math|''g'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} and a point '''a''' in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  Let ''D''<sub>'''a'''</sub>''g'' denote the total derivative of ''g'' at '''a''' and ''D''<sub>''g''('''a''')</sub>''f'' denote the total derivative of ''f'' at ''g''('''a''').  These two derivatives are linear transformations {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} and {{math|'''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''k''</sup>}}, respectively, so they can be composed.  The chain rule for total derivatives says that their composite is the total derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} at '''a''':\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{a}}(f \\circ g) = D_{g(\\mathbf{a})}f \\circ D_{\\mathbf{a}}g,</math>\nor for short,\n:<math>D(f \\circ g) = Df \\circ Dg.</math>\nThe higher-dimensional chain rule can be proved using a technique similar to the second proof given above.\n\nBecause the total derivative is a linear transformation, the functions appearing in the formula can be rewritten as matrices.  The matrix corresponding to a total derivative is called a [[Jacobian matrix]], and the composite of two derivatives corresponds to the product of their Jacobian matrices.  From this perspective the chain rule therefore says:\n:<math>J_{f \\circ g}(\\mathbf{a}) = J_{f}(g(\\mathbf{a})) J_{g}(\\mathbf{a}),</math>\nor for short,\n:<math>J_{f \\circ g} = (J_f \\circ g)J_g.</math>\n\nThat is, the Jacobian of a composite function is the product of the Jacobians of the composed functions (evaluated at the appropriate points).\n\nThe higher-dimensional chain rule is a generalization of the one-dimensional chain rule.  If ''k'', ''m'', and ''n'' are 1, so that {{math|''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}} and {{math|''g'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}}, then the Jacobian matrices of ''f'' and ''g'' are {{math|1 \u00d7 1}}.  Specifically, they are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nJ_g(a) &= \\begin{pmatrix} g'(a) \\end{pmatrix}, \\\\\nJ_{f}(g(a)) &= \\begin{pmatrix} f'(g(a)) \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe Jacobian of ''f'' \u2218 ''g'' is the product of these {{math|1 \u00d7 1}} matrices, so it is {{math|''f''\u2032(''g''(''a''))\u22c5''g''\u2032(''a'')}}, as expected from the one-dimensional chain rule.  In the language of linear transformations, ''D''<sub>''a''</sub>(''g'') is the function which scales a vector by a factor of ''g''\u2032(''a'') and ''D''<sub>''g''(''a'')</sub>(''f'') is the function which scales a vector by a factor of ''f''\u2032(''g''(''a'')).  The chain rule says that the composite of these two linear transformations is the linear transformation {{math|''D''<sub>''a''</sub>(''f'' \u2218 ''g'')}}, and therefore it is the function that scales a vector by ''f''\u2032(''g''(''a''))\u22c5''g''\u2032(''a'').\n\nAnother way of writing the chain rule is used when ''f'' and ''g'' are expressed in terms of their components as {{math|1='''y''' = ''f''('''u''') = (''f''<sub>1</sub>('''u'''), \u2026, ''f''<sub>''k''</sub>('''u'''))}} and {{math|1='''u''' = ''g''('''x''') = (''g''<sub>1</sub>('''x'''), \u2026, ''g''<sub>''m''</sub>('''x'''))}}.  In this case, the above rule for Jacobian matrices is usually written as:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial(y_1, \\ldots, y_k)}{\\partial(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)} = \\frac{\\partial(y_1, \\ldots, y_k)}{\\partial(u_1, \\ldots, u_m)} \\frac{\\partial(u_1, \\ldots, u_m)}{\\partial(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)}.</math>\n\nThe chain rule for total derivatives implies a chain rule for partial derivatives.  Recall that when the total derivative exists, the partial derivative in the ''i''th coordinate direction is found by multiplying the Jacobian matrix by the ''i''th basis vector.  By doing this to the formula above, we find:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial(y_1, \\ldots, y_k)}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{\\partial(y_1, \\ldots, y_k)}{\\partial(u_1, \\ldots, u_m)} \\frac{\\partial(u_1, \\ldots, u_m)}{\\partial x_i}.</math>\nSince the entries of the Jacobian matrix are partial derivatives, we may simplify the above formula to get:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial(y_1, \\ldots, y_k)}{\\partial x_i} = \\sum_{\\ell = 1}^m \\frac{\\partial(y_1, \\ldots, y_k)}{\\partial u_\\ell} \\frac{\\partial u_\\ell}{\\partial x_i}.</math>\nMore conceptually, this rule expresses the fact that a change in the ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> direction may change all of ''g''<sub>1</sub> through ''g<sub>m</sub>'', and any of these changes may affect ''f''.\n\nIn the special case where {{math|1=''k'' = 1}}, so that ''f'' is a real-valued function, then this formula simplifies even further:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_i} = \\sum_{\\ell = 1}^m \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_\\ell} \\frac{\\partial u_\\ell}{\\partial x_i}.</math>\nThis can be rewritten as a [[dot product]].  Recalling that {{math|'''u''' {{=}} (''g''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''g''<sub>''m''</sub>)}}, the partial derivative {{math|\u2202'''u''' / \u2202''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is also a vector, and the chain rule says that:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_i} = \\nabla y \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial x_i}.</math>\n\n=== Example ===\nGiven {{math|1=''u''(''x'', ''y'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup> + 2''y''}} where {{math|1=''x''(''r'', ''t'') = ''r'' sin(''t'')}} and {{math|1=''y''(''r'',''t'') = sin<sup>2</sup>(''t'')}}, determine the value of {{math|\u2202''u'' / \u2202''r''}} and {{math|\u2202''u'' / \u2202''t''}} using the chain rule.\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r}=\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial r}+\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial r} = (2x)(\\sin(t)) + (2)(0) = 2r \\sin^2(t),</math>\nand\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\n&= \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t} \\\\\n&= (2x)(r\\cos(t)) + (2)(2\\sin(t)\\cos(t)) \\\\\n&= (2r\\sin(t))(r\\cos(t)) + 4\\sin(t)\\cos(t) \\\\\n&= 2(r^2 + 2) \\sin(t)\\cos(t) \\\\\n&= (r^2 + 2) \\sin(2t).\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Higher derivatives of multivariable functions ===\n{{Main|Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula#Multivariate version}}\nFa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula for higher-order derivatives of single-variable functions generalizes to the multivariable case.  If {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''('''u''')}} is a function of {{math|1='''u''' = ''g''('''x''')}} as above, then the second derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} is:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} = \\sum_k \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_k}\\frac{\\partial^2 u_k}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}\\right) + \\sum_{k, \\ell} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial u_k \\partial u_\\ell}\\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_i}\\frac{\\partial u_\\ell}{\\partial x_j}\\right).</math>\n\n== Further generalizations ==\nAll extensions of calculus have a chain rule. In most of these, the formula remains the same, though the meaning of that formula may be vastly different.\n\nOne generalization is to [[manifold]]s. In this situation, the chain rule represents the fact that the derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} is the composite of the derivative of ''f'' and the derivative of ''g''. This theorem is an immediate consequence of the higher dimensional chain rule given above, and it has exactly the same formula.\n\nThe chain rule is also valid for [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]]s in [[Banach space]]s.  The same formula holds as before. This case and the previous one admit a simultaneous generalization to [[Banach manifold]]s.\n\nIn [[abstract algebra]], the derivative is interpreted as a morphism of modules of [[K\u00e4hler differential]]s. A [[ring homomorphism]] of [[commutative ring]]s {{math|''f'' : ''R'' \u2192 ''S''}} determines a morphism of K\u00e4hler differentials {{math|''Df'' : \u03a9<sub>''R''</sub> \u2192 \u03a9<sub>''S''</sub>}} which sends an element ''dr'' to ''d''(''f''(''r'')), the exterior differential of ''f''(''r''). The formula {{math|1=''D''(''f'' \u2218 ''g'') = ''Df'' \u2218 ''Dg''}} holds in this context as well.\n\nThe common feature of these examples is that they are expressions of the idea that the derivative is part of a [[functor]]. A functor is an operation on spaces and functions between them. It associates to each space a new space and to each function between two spaces a new function between the corresponding new spaces. In each of the above cases, the functor sends each space to its [[tangent bundle]] and it sends each function to its derivative. For example, in the manifold case, the derivative sends a ''C''<sup>''r''</sup>-manifold to a ''C''<sup>''r''\u22121</sup>-manifold (its tangent bundle) and a ''C''<sup>''r''</sup>-function to its total derivative. There is one requirement for this to be a functor, namely that the derivative of a composite must be the composite of the derivatives.  This is exactly the formula {{math|1=''D''(''f'' \u2218 ''g'') = ''Df'' \u2218 ''Dg''}}.\n\nThere are also chain rules in [[stochastic calculus]]. One of these, [[It\u014d's lemma]], expresses the composite of an It\u014d process (or more generally a [[semimartingale]]) ''dX''<sub>''t''</sub> with a twice-differentiable function ''f''.  In It\u014d's lemma, the derivative of the composite function depends not only on ''dX''<sub>''t''</sub> and the derivative of ''f'' but also on the second derivative of ''f''. The dependence on the second derivative is a consequence of the non-zero [[quadratic variation]] of the stochastic process, which broadly speaking means that the process can move up and down in a very rough way. This variant of the chain rule is not an example of a functor because the two functions being composed are of different types.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Integration by substitution]]\n* [[Leibniz integral rule]]\n* [[Quotient rule]]\n* [[Triple product rule]]\n* [[Product rule]]\n* [[Automatic differentiation]], a computational method that makes heavy use of the chain rule to compute exact numerical derivatives.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{springer|title=Leibniz rule|id=Leibniz_rule}}\n* {{MathWorld | urlname=ChainRule | title=Chain Rule}}\n\n[[Category:Differentiation rules]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:Theorems in calculus]]", "sha1": "gym64x6g5e4pwgi4kpzl5udxdqv3wj1"}}, {"title": "P versus NP problem", "ns": "0", "id": "6115", "revision": {"id": "866658890", "parentid": "866658812", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T18:28:08Z", "contributor": {"username": "Serols", "id": "9929111"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/172.78.97.154|172.78.97.154]] ([[User talk:172.78.97.154|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{unsolved|computer science|If the solution to a problem is easy to check for correctness, must the problem be easy to solve?}}\n[[File:Complexity classes.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram of complexity classes provided that '''P'''&nbsp;[[\u2260]]&nbsp;'''NP'''.

The general class of questions for which some algorithm can provide an answer in polynomial time is called \"class '''P'''\" or just \"'''[[P (complexity)|P]]'''\". For some questions, there is no known way to find an answer quickly, but if one is provided with information showing what the answer is, it is possible to verify the answer quickly. The class of questions for which an answer can be ''verified'' in polynomial time is called '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''', which stands for \"nondeterministic polynomial time\".<ref group=\"Note\">A nondeterministic [[Turing machine]] can move to a state that is not determined by the previous state. Such a machine could solve an '''NP''' problem in polynomial time by falling into the correct answer state (by luck), then conventionally verifying it. Such machines are not practical for solving realistic problems but can be used as theoretical models.</ref>\n\nConsider [[Sudoku]], a game where the player is given a partially filled-in grid of numbers and attempts to complete the grid following certain rules. Given an incomplete Sudoku grid, of any size, is there at least one legal solution?  Any proposed solution is easily verified, and the time to check a solution grows slowly (polynomially) as the grid gets bigger.  However, all known algorithms for finding solutions take, for difficult examples, time that grows exponentially as the grid gets bigger.  So, Sudoku is in '''NP''' (quickly checkable) but does not seem to be in '''P''' (quickly solvable).  Thousands of other problems seem similar, in that they are fast to check but slow to solve.  Researchers have shown that many of the problems in '''NP''' have the extra property that a fast solution to any one of them could be used to build a quick solution to any other problem in '''NP''', a property called [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-completeness]].  Decades of searching have not yielded a fast solution to any of these problems, so most scientists suspect that none of these problems can be solved quickly.  This, however, has never been proven.\n\nAn answer to the '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' question would determine whether problems that can be verified in polynomial time, like Sudoku, can also be solved in polynomial time. If it turned out that '''P'''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;'''NP''', it would mean that there are problems in '''NP'''  that are harder to compute than to verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but the answer could be verified in polynomial time.\n\nAside from being an important problem in computational theory, a proof either way would have profound implications for mathematics, cryptography, algorithm research, [[artificial intelligence]], [[game theory]], multimedia processing, [[philosophy]], [[economics]] and many other fields.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Golden Ticket: P, NP, and the Search for the Impossible|last=Fortnow|first=Lance|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780691156491|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAlthough the '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem was formally defined in 1971, there were previous inklings of the problems involved, the difficulty of proof, and the potential consequences.  In 1955, mathematician John Nash wrote a letter to the NSA, where he speculated that cracking a sufficiently complex code would require time exponential in the length of the key.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letters from John Nash |url=https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/press-releases/2012/assets/files/nash-exhibit/nash_letters1.pdf |author=NSA |year=2012}}</ref>  If proved (and Nash was suitably skeptical) this would imply what we today would call '''P'''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;'''NP''', since a proposed key can easily be verified in polynomial time. Another mention of the underlying problem occurred in a 1956 letter written by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] to [[John von Neumann]].  G\u00f6del asked whether theorem-proving (now known to be [[co-NP-complete|'''co-NP'''-complete]]) could be solved in [[quadratic time|quadratic]] or [[linear time]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartmanis | first1 = Juris | year = | title = G\u00f6del, von Neumann, and the '''P''' = '''NP''' problem | url = http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/6910/1/89-994.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 101\u2013107 }}</ref> and pointed out one of the most important consequences\u2014that if so, then the discovery of mathematical proofs could be automated.\n\n==Context==\nThe relation between the [[complexity class]]es '''P''' and '''NP''' is studied in [[computational complexity theory]], the part of the [[theory of computation]] dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem. The most common resources are time (how many steps it takes to solve a problem) and space (how much memory it takes to solve a problem).\n\nIn such analysis, a model of the computer for which time must be analyzed is required. Typically such models assume that the computer is ''[[Deterministic computation|deterministic]]'' (given the computer's present state and any inputs, there is only one possible action that the computer might take) and ''sequential'' (it performs actions one after the other).\n\nIn this theory, the class '''P''' consists of all those ''[[decision problem]]s'' (defined [[#Formal definitions|below]]) that can be solved on a deterministic sequential machine in an amount of time that is [[polynomial]] in the size of the input; the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' consists of all those decision problems whose positive solutions can be verified in [[polynomial time]] given the right information, or equivalently, whose solution can be found in polynomial time on a [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|non-deterministic]] machine.<ref>Sipser, Michael: ''Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Second Edition, International Edition'', page 270.

'''NP'''-complete problems are a set of problems to each of which any other '''NP'''-problem can be reduced in polynomial time, and whose solution may still be verified in polynomial time. That is, any '''NP''' problem can be transformed into any of the '''NP'''-complete problems. Informally, an '''NP'''-complete problem is an '''NP '''problem that is at least as \"tough\" as any other problem in '''NP'''.\n\n[[NP-hard|'''NP'''-hard]] problems are those at least as hard as '''NP''' problems, i.e., all '''NP''' problems can be reduced (in polynomial time) to them. '''NP'''-hard problems need not be in '''NP''', i.e., they need not have solutions verifiable in polynomial time.\n\nFor instance, the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] is '''NP'''-complete by the [[Cook\u2013Levin theorem]], so ''any'' instance of ''any'' problem in '''NP''' can be transformed mechanically into an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem in polynomial time. The Boolean satisfiability problem is one of many such '''NP'''-complete problems. If any '''NP'''-complete problem is in '''P''', then it would follow that '''P''' = '''NP'''. However, many important problems have been shown to be '''NP'''-complete, and no fast algorithm for any of them is known.\n\nBased on the definition alone it is not obvious that '''NP'''-complete problems exist; however, a trivial and contrived '''NP'''-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given a description of a [[Turing machine]] ''M'' guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does there exist a polynomial-size input that ''M'' will accept?<ref name=\"Scott\">{{Cite web|author=Scott Aaronson|title=PHYS771 Lecture 6: '''P''', '''NP''', and Friends|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec6.html |accessdate=27 August 2007}}</ref> It is in '''NP''' because (given an input) it is simple to check whether ''M'' accepts the input by simulating ''M''; it is '''NP'''-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in '''NP''' can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine ''M'' that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then the question of whether the instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.\n\nThe first natural problem proven to be '''NP'''-complete was the Boolean satisfiability problem, also known as SAT. As noted above, this is the Cook\u2013Levin theorem; its proof that satisfiability is '''NP'''-complete contains technical details about Turing machines as they relate to the definition of '''NP'''. However, after this problem was proved to be '''NP'''-complete, [[reduction (complexity)|proof by reduction]] provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are also '''NP'''-complete, including the game Sudoku discussed earlier. In this case, the proof shows that a solution of Sudoku in polynomial time could also be used to complete [[Latin square]]s in polynomial time.<ref>{{cite web |title=NP-completeness of Sudoku |url=http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/paul.goldberg/FCS/sudoku.html}}</ref>  This in turn gives a solution to the problem of partitioning [[multipartite graph|tri-partite graphs]] into triangles,<ref>{{cite article |author=Colbourn, Charles J. |title=The complexity of completing partial Latin squares |journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1984 |pages=25-30 }}</ref> which could then be used to find solutions for the special case of SAT known as 3-SAT,<ref>{{cite article |author=I. Holyer |title=The '''NP'''-completeness of some edge-partition problems |journal=SIAM J. Comput. |volume=10 |year=1981 |pages=713&ndash;717}}</ref> which then provides a solution for general Boolean satisfiability.  So a polynomial time solution to Sudoku leads, by a series of mechanical transformations, to a polynomial time solution of satisfiability, which in turn can be used to solve any other '''NP'''-complete problem in polynomial time.  Using transformations like this, a vast class of seemingly unrelated problems are all reducible to one another, and are in a sense \"the same problem\".\n\n==Harder problems==\n{{See also|Complexity class}}\n\nAlthough it is unknown whether '''P''' = '''NP''', problems outside of '''P''' are known. Just as the class '''P''' is defined in terms of polynomial running time, the class '''[[EXPTIME]]''' is the set of all decision problems that have ''exponential'' running time. In other words, any problem in '''EXPTIME''' is solvable by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[big O notation|O]](2<sup>''p''(''n'')</sup>) time, where ''p''(''n'') is a polynomial function of ''n''. A decision problem is [[EXPTIME#EXPTIME-complete|'''EXPTIME'''-complete]] if it is in '''EXPTIME''', and every problem in '''EXPTIME''' has a [[polynomial-time many-one reduction]] to it. A number of problems are known to be '''EXPTIME'''-complete. Because it can be shown that '''P''' \u2260 '''EXPTIME''', these problems are outside '''P''', and so require more than polynomial time. In fact, by the [[time hierarchy theorem]], they cannot be solved in significantly less than exponential time. Examples include finding a perfect strategy for [[chess]] positions on an ''N'' \u00d7 ''N'' board<ref name=\"Fraenkel1981\">{{Cite journal| author = [[Aviezri Fraenkel]] and D.

Fischer and [[Michael O. Rabin|Rabin]] proved in 1974<ref>{{cite journal | first1=Michael J. | last1=Fischer | authorlink1=Michael J.

Hence, the problem is known to need more than exponential run time. Even more difficult are the [[undecidable problem]]s, such as the [[halting problem]].

One such class, consisting of counting problems, is called [[Sharp-P#P|'''#P''']]: whereas an '''NP''' problem asks \"Are there any solutions?\", the corresponding '''#P''' problem asks \"How many solutions are there?\"  Clearly, a '''#P''' problem must be at least as hard as the corresponding '''NP''' problem, since a count of solutions immediately tells if at least one solution exists, if the count is greater than zero. Surprisingly, some '''#P''' problems that are believed to be difficult correspond to easy (for example linear-time) '''P''' problems.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Valiant, Leslie G. |title=The complexity of enumeration and reliability problems |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |volume=8 |issue=3 |year=1979 |pages=410-421 |doi=10.1137/0208032}}</ref>  For these problems, it is very easy to tell whether solutions exist, but thought to be very hard to tell how many.

Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than ''k''. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in '''NP''' and in '''[[co-NP]]''' (and even in '''UP''' and '''co-UP'''<ref>[[Lance Fortnow]].

A theoretical polynomial algorithm may have extremely large constant factors or exponents thus rendering it impractical. On the other hand, even if a problem is shown to be '''NP'''-complete, and even if '''P''' \u2260 '''NP''', there may still be effective approaches to tackling the problem in practice. There are algorithms for many '''NP'''-complete problems, such as the [[knapsack problem]], the [[traveling salesman problem]] and the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], that can solve to optimality many real-world instances in reasonable time. The empirical [[average-case complexity]] (time vs. problem size) of such algorithms can be surprisingly low.  An example is the [[simplex algorithm]] in [[linear programming]], which works surprisingly well in practice; despite having exponential worst-case [[time complexity]] it runs on par with the best known polynomial-time algorithms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gondzio|first1=Jacek|last2=Terlaky|first2=Tam\u00e1s|chapter=3 A computational view of interior point methods |mr=1438311 |title=Advances in linear and integer programming|pages=103\u2013144|editor=J.&nbsp;E.

Most proofs (especially classical ones) apply uniformly in a world with oracles regardless of what the oracle does. These proofs are called ''relativizing''. In 1975, Baker, Gill, and [[Robert M.

Then, all such languages in '''P''' can be expressed in [[first-order logic]] with the addition of a suitable least [[fixed-point combinator]]. Effectively, this, in combination with the order, allows the definition of recursive functions. As long as the signature contains at least one predicate or function in addition to the distinguished order relation, so that the amount of space taken to store such finite structures is actually polynomial in the number of elements in the structure, this precisely characterizes '''P'''.\n\nSimilarly, '''NP''' is the set of languages expressible in existential [[second-order logic]]\u2014that is, second-order logic restricted to exclude [[universal quantification]] over relations, functions, and subsets. The languages in the [[polynomial hierarchy]], '''[[PH (complexity)|PH]]''', correspond to all of second-order logic. Thus, the question \"is '''P''' a proper subset of '''NP'''\" can be reformulated as \"is existential second-order logic able to describe languages (of finite linearly ordered structures with nontrivial signature) that first-order logic with least fixed point cannot?\".<ref>Elvira Mayordomo.

However, there are algorithms known for '''NP'''-complete problems with the property that if '''P''' = '''NP''', then the algorithm runs in polynomial time on accepting instances (although with enormous constants, making the algorithm impractical). However, these algorithms do not qualify as polynomial time because their running time on rejecting instances are not polynomial. The following algorithm, due to [[Leonid Levin|Levin]] (without any citation), is such an example below. It correctly accepts the '''NP'''-complete language [[subset sum problem|SUBSET-SUM]]. It runs in polynomial time on inputs that are in SUBSET-SUM if and only if '''P''' = '''NP''':\n\n ''// Algorithm that accepts the '''NP'''-complete language SUBSET-SUM.\n ''//\n ''// this is a polynomial-time algorithm if and only if '''P''' = '''NP'''.\n ''//\n ''// \"Polynomial-time\" means it returns \"yes\" in polynomial time when\n ''// the answer should be \"yes\", and runs forever when it is \"no\".\n ''//\n ''// Input: S = a finite set of integers\n ''// Output: \"yes\" if any subset of S adds up to 0.\n ''// Runs forever with no output otherwise.\n ''// Note: \"Program number P\" is the program obtained by\n ''// writing the integer P in binary, then\n ''// considering that string of bits to be a\n ''// program. Every possible program can be\n ''// generated this way, though most do nothing\n ''// because of syntax errors.''\n FOR N = 1...\u221e\n   FOR P = 1...N\n     Run program number P for N steps with input S\n     IF the program outputs a list of distinct integers\n       AND the integers are all in S\n       AND the integers sum to 0\n     THEN\n       OUTPUT \"yes\" and HALT\n\nIf, and only if, '''P''' = '''NP''', then this is a polynomial-time algorithm accepting an '''NP'''-complete language. \"Accepting\" means it gives \"yes\" answers in polynomial time, but is allowed to run forever when the answer is \"no\" (also known as a ''semi-algorithm'').\n\nThis algorithm is enormously impractical, even if '''P''' = '''NP'''. If the shortest program that can solve SUBSET-SUM in polynomial time is ''b'' bits long, the above algorithm will try at least 2<sup>''b''</sup>\u22121 other programs first.\n\n==Formal definitions==\n\n===P and NP===\nConceptually speaking, a ''decision problem'' is a problem that takes as input some [[String (computer science)|string]] ''w'' over an alphabet \u03a3, and outputs \"yes\" or \"no\". If there is an [[algorithm]] (say a [[Turing machine]], or a [[Computer programming|computer program]] with unbounded memory) that can produce the correct answer for any input string of length ''n'' in at most ''cn<sup>k</sup>'' steps, where ''k'' and ''c'' are constants independent of the input string, then we say that the problem can be solved in ''polynomial time'' and we place it in the class '''P'''. Formally, '''P''' is defined as the set of all languages that can be decided by a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. That is,\n:<math>\\mathbf{P} = \\{ L : L=L(M) \\text{ for some deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine } M \\}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>L(M) = \\{ w\\in\\Sigma^{*}: M \\text{ accepts } w \\}</math>\nand a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine ''M'' that satisfies the following two conditions:\n\n# ''M'' halts on all input ''w'' and\n# there exists <math>k \\in N</math> such that <math>T_M(n)\\in O(n^k)</math>, where ''O'' refers to the [[Big O notation#Formal definition|big O notation]] and\n::<math>T_M(n) = \\max\\{ t_M(w) : w\\in\\Sigma^{*}, |w| = n \\}</math>\n::<math>t_M(w) = \\text{ number of steps }M\\text{ takes to halt on input }w.</math>\n\n'''NP''' can be defined similarly using nondeterministic Turing machines (the traditional way). However, a modern approach to define '''NP''' is to use the concept of ''[[Certificate (complexity)|certificate]]'' and ''verifier''. Formally, '''NP''' is defined as the set of languages over a finite alphabet that have a verifier that runs in polynomial time, where the notion of \"verifier\" is defined as follows.\n\nLet ''L'' be a language over a finite alphabet, \u03a3.\n\n''L'' \u2208 '''NP''' if, and only if, there exists a binary relation <math>R\\subset\\Sigma^{*}\\times\\Sigma^{*}</math> and a positive integer ''k'' such that the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n# <abbr title=\"For all strings x in \u03a3*, x is in L if and only if there is a y in \u03a3* such that (x, y) is in R and the length of y is polynomial in the length of x\">For all <math>x\\in\\Sigma^{*}</math>, <math>x\\in L \\Leftrightarrow\\exists y\\in\\Sigma^{*}</math> such that (''x'', ''y'') \u2208 ''R'' and <math>|y|\\in O(|x|^k)</math></abbr>; and\n# the language <abbr title=\"L[R], consisting of x followed by y with a delimiter in the middle\"><math>L_{R} = \\{ x\\# y:(x,y)\\in R\\}</math> over <math>\\Sigma\\cup\\{\\#\\}</math></abbr> is decidable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.\n\nA Turing machine that decides ''L<sub>R</sub>'' is called a ''verifier'' for ''L'' and a ''y'' such that (''x'', ''y'') \u2208 ''R'' is called a ''certificate of membership'' of ''x'' in ''L''.\n\nIn general, a verifier does not have to be polynomial-time. However, for ''L'' to be in '''NP''', there must be a verifier that runs in polynomial time.\n\n====Example====\nLet\n:<math>\\mathrm{COMPOSITE} = \\left \\{x\\in\\mathbb{N} \\mid x=pq \\text{ for integers } p, q > 1 \\right \\}</math>\n:<math>R = \\left \\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{N} \\times\\mathbb{N} \\mid 1<y \\leq \\sqrt x \\text{ and } y \\text{ divides } x \\right \\}.</math>\nClearly, the question of whether a given ''x'' is a [[Composite number|composite]] is equivalent to the question of whether ''x'' is a member of COMPOSITE. It can be shown that COMPOSITE \u2208 '''NP''' by verifying that it satisfies the above definition (if we identify natural numbers with their binary representations).\n\nCOMPOSITE also happens to be in '''P''', a fact demonstrated by the invention of the [[AKS primality test]].<ref name=\"Agrawal\">{{cite journal |first=Manindra |last=Agrawal |first2=Neeraj |last2=Kayal |first3=Nitin |last3=Saxena |url=http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/algebra/primality_v6.pdf |title=PRIMES is in '''P''' |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume=160 |year=2004 |issue=2 |pages=781\u2013793 |doi=10.4007/annals.2004.160.781 |jstor=3597229 }}</ref>\n\n===NP-completeness===\n{{Main|NP-completeness}}\n\nThere are many equivalent ways of describing '''NP'''-completeness.\n\nLet ''L'' be a language over a finite alphabet \u03a3.\n\n''L'' is '''NP'''-complete if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n# ''L'' \u2208 '''NP'''; and\n# any ''L\u2032'' in '''NP''' is polynomial-time-reducible to ''L'' (written as <math>L' \\leq_{p} L</math>), where <math>L' \\leq_{p} L</math> if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:\n## There exists ''f'' : \u03a3* \u2192 \u03a3* such that for all ''w'' in \u03a3* we have: <math>(w\\in L' \\Leftrightarrow f(w)\\in L)</math>; and\n## there exists a polynomial-time Turing machine that halts with ''f''(''w'') on its tape on any input ''w''.\n\nAlternatively, if ''L'' \u2208 '''NP''', and there is another '''NP'''-complete problem that can be polynomial-time reduced to ''L'', then ''L'' is '''NP'''-complete. This is a common way of proving some new problem is '''NP'''-complete.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe film ''[[Travelling Salesman (2012 film)|Travelling Salesman]]'', by director Timothy Lanzone, is the story of four mathematicians hired by the US government to solve the '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geere|first=Duncan|title='Travelling Salesman' movie considers the repercussions if P equals NP|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-04/26/travelling-salesman|publisher=Wired|accessdate=26 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the sixth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''{{'}} seventh season \"[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]\", the equation '''P'''='''NP''' is seen shortly after Homer accidentally stumbles into the \"third dimension\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hardesty|first=Larry|title=Explained: '''P''' vs. '''NP'''|url=http://news.mit.edu/2009/explainer-pnp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Shadia|first=Ajam|title=What is the '''P''' vs. '''NP''' problem?

Even his work in philosophy and logic will not be understood until this fact becomes a standing premise of Peircean studies.|Max Fisch 1964, p. 486.<ref name=SP2/>}}\n\nPeirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[philosophy]], [[statistics]], [[astronomy]],<ref name=SP2/> [[metrology]],<ref name=metr/> [[geodesy]], [[experimental psychology]],<ref name=psych/> [[economics]],<ref name=econom/> [[linguistics]],<ref name=ling/> and the [[history and philosophy of science]]. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.\n\nPeirce's philosophy includes (see below in related sections) a pervasive three-category system, belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion ([[fallibilism]]) and discoverable (no radical skepticism), logic as formal semiotic on signs, on arguments, and on inquiry's ways\u2014including philosophical [[pragmatism]] (which he founded), [[#Critical common-sensism|critical common-sensism]], and [[scientific method]]&mdash;and, in metaphysics: [[Philosophical realism|Scholastic realism]], e.g. [[John Duns Scotus]], belief in God, freedom, and at least an attenuated immortality, [[objective idealism]], and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance, mechanical necessity, and creative love.  In his work, fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like [[skepticism]] and [[positivism]], respectively, in others' work.  However, for Peirce, fallibilism is balanced by an [[Pragmatism#antiskep|anti-skepticism]] and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity,<ref name=FCE>Peirce (1897) \"Fallibilism, Continuity, and Evolution\", ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.141\u2013175 ([http://www.textlog.de/4248.html Eprint]), placed by the ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', editors directly after \"F.R.L.\" (1899, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.135\u2013140).</ref> and pragmatism commits one to anti-[[nominalist]] belief in the reality of the general (CP 5.453\u2013457).\n\nFor Peirce, First Philosophy, which he also called cenoscopy, is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences.<ref name=phil>Peirce (1903), ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.180-202 and (1906) \"The Basis of Pragmaticism\", ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:372\u2013373, see \"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/philosophy.html Philosophy]\" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S.

The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce developed in response to reading [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[G. W. F. Hegel]], categories that Peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life.<ref name=Burch/> Peirce scholars generally regard the \"New List\" as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's \"architectonic\", his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern that one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in \"[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How To Make Our Ideas Clear]]\" (1878 paper foundational to pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work.\n\n\"On a New List of Categories\" is cast as a Kantian deduction; it is short but dense and difficult to summarize.

He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative or [[universal rhetoric]], or methodeutic,<ref name=rhetoric/> the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism.\n\n====Presuppositions of logic====\nIn his \"F.R.L.\" [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and \"in one sense, the sole\", rule of reason is that, ''to learn, one needs to desire to learn'' and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think.<ref name=\"FRL\"/> So, the first rule is, ''to wonder''. Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories:\n:...there follows one [[corollary]] which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:\n<center>Do not block the way of inquiry.</center>\nPeirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that \"the one unpardonable offence\" is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which \"metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted\". Peirce in many writings holds that [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|logic precedes metaphysics]] (ontological, religious, and physical).\n\nPeirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of ''fallibilism'', which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real ([[tychism]] and [[synechism]]).<ref name=FCE/>\n\nThe First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough ([[#defs|see below]]). He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.<ref>Peirce (1902), The Carnegie Institute Application, Memoir 10, MS L75.361-2, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-04.htm#m10 Eprint].</ref>\n\n====Four incapacities====\n<div class=infobox style=\"padding:5px;font-size:94%;width:auto\">The ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' series (1868\u20131869), including\n* Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man (1868)\n* Some Consequences of Four Incapacities (1868)\n* Grounds of Validity of the Laws of Logic: <br>Further Consequences of Four Incapacities (1869)</div> In three articles in 1868\u20131869,<ref name=QFM/><ref name=SCFI>Peirce (1868), \"Some Consequences of Four Incapacities\", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YHkqP2JHJ_IC&pg=RA1-PA140 pp. 140\u2013157].

It differs from the current looser sense that encompasses instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference.)\n\nPeirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous, the validity of the modes of reasoning,<ref name=GVLL/> and the falsity of philosophical [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Cartesianism]] ([[#Against Cartesianism|see below]]).\n\nPeirce rejected the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself<ref name=SCFI /> and later said that to \"dismiss make-believes\" is a prerequisite for pragmatism.<ref>Peirce (1905), \"What Pragmatism Is\", ''The Monist'', v.

''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/whatis/whatpragis.htm Eprint].</ref>\n\n====Logic as formal semiotic====\nPeirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought's processes, and also to explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods.<ref name=ars/> Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in [[Aristotle]]'s work, in such ''loci'' as: the basic terminology of [[psychology]] in ''[[On the Soul]]''; the founding description of [[sign relation]]s in ''[[On Interpretation]]''; and the differentiation of [[inference]] into three modes that are commonly translated into English as ''[[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]'', in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', as well as inference by [[analogy]] (called ''paradeigma'' by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes.\n\nPeirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories. He called it both ''[[semiotic]]'' and ''semeiotic''. Both are current in singular and plural. He based it on the conception of a triadic [[sign relation]], and defined ''[[semiosis]]'' as \"action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of ''three'' subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs\".<ref>Peirce 1907, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.484. Reprinted, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:411 in \"Pragmatism\" (398\u2013433).</ref> As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse:\n\n{{quote|To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.|Peirce 1868.<ref name=QFM/>}}\nPeirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where 'sign' is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or ''quasi-mind'', that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or bees<ref>See \"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/quasimind.html Quasi-mind]\" in ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.</ref> \u2014 the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields which he also pursued).\n\nInquiry is a kind of inference process, a manner of thinking and semiosis. Global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs, and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process, enable the study of inquiry on semiotics' three levels:\n\n# Conditions for meaningfulness. Study of significatory elements and combinations, their grammar.\n# Validity, conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various separate modes.\n# Conditions for determining interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes.\n\nPeirce uses examples often from common experience, but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic. In a formal vein, Peirce said:\n\n{{quote|''On the Definition of Logic''. Logic is ''formal semiotic''. A sign is something, ''A'', which brings something, ''B'', its ''interpretant'' sign, determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence (or a lower implied sort) with something, ''C'', its ''object'', as that in which itself stands to ''C''. This definition no more involves any reference to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies during a lapse of time. It is from this definition that I deduce the principles of logic by mathematical reasoning, and by mathematical reasoning that, I aver, will support criticism of [[Weierstrass]]ian severity, and that is perfectly evident. The word \"formal\" in the definition is also defined.|sign= Peirce, \"Carnegie Application\", ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 4, p. 54.}}\n\n===Signs===\n{{Main article|Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce}} {{See also|Representation (arts)#Peirce and representation|Sign (semiotics)#Triadic signs}}\n:''A list of noted writings by Peirce on signs and sign relations is at [[Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce#References and further reading|Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce \u00a7 References and further reading]].''\n\n====Sign relation====\nPeirce's theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign \u2014 not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The ''[[sign relation]]'' is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its ''object'', and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its ''interpretant'' (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible ''[[triadic relation]]'', according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.\n\n''Extension \u00d7 intension = information.'' Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of ''[[intension]]'' (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]], significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of ''[[Logic of information|information]]'', including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole.<ref>Peirce (1867), \"Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension\" (CP 2.391\u2013426), ([http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_06/v2_06.htm ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 2:70\u201386]).</ref> For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.\n\n''Determination.'' A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object \u2014 the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object \u2014 an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something ''as'' a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience<ref name=collateral>See pp. 404\u2013409 in \"Pragmatism\" in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2. Ten quotes on collateral experience from Peirce provided by Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101 here] at peirce-l's Lyris archive.

Peirce used the word \"determine\" not in a strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of \"specializes,\" ''bestimmt'',<ref name=determined>Peirce, letter to William James, dated 1909, see ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:492.</ref> involving variable amount, like an influence.<ref name=Marty>See \"[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/76defeng.htm 76 definitions of the sign by C.S.Peirce]\", collected by Robert Marty (U. of Perpignan, France).</ref> Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination.<ref>Peirce, A Letter to Lady Welby (1908), ''[[#SS|Semiotic and Significs]]'', pp. 80\u201381: {{quote|I define a Sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its Interpretant, that the latter is thereby mediately determined by the former. My insertion of \"upon a person\" is a sop to Cerberus, because I despair of making my own broader conception understood.}}</ref> The object determines the sign to determine another sign \u2014 the interpretant \u2014 to be related to the object ''as the sign is related to the object'', hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.<ref name=Marty/>\n\n====Semiotic elements====\nPeirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):\n# A ''sign'' (or ''representamen'')<ref>''Representamen'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|r|\u025b|p|r|\u026a|z|\u025b|n|\u02c8|t|e\u026a|m|\u0259|n}} {{respell|REP|ri|zen|TAY|m\u0259n}}) was adopted ([[wikt:representamen|not coined]]) by Peirce as his technical term for the ''sign'' as covered in his theory, in case a divergence should come to light between his theoretical version and the popular senses of the word \"sign\". He eventually stopped using \"representamen\". See ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:272\u2013273 and ''[[#SS|Semiotic and Significs]]'' p. 193, quotes in \"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/representamen.html Representamen]\" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.</ref> represents, in the broadest possible sense of \"represents\". It is something interpretable as saying something about something. It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial\u2014a cloud might be a sign of rain for instance, or ruins the sign of ancient civilization.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language|year=1984|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington & Indianapolis|isbn=978-0-253-20398-4|page=15}}</ref>  As Peirce sometimes put it (he defined ''sign'' at least 76 times<ref name=Marty/>), the sign stands ''for'' the object ''to'' the interpretant. A sign represents its object in some respect, which respect is the sign's ''ground''.<ref name=ground/>\n# An ''object'' (or ''semiotic object'') is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as [[Prince Hamlet]].<ref name=fictive>Peirce (1909), A Letter to William James, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:492-502. Fictional object, 498. Object as universe of discourse, 492. See \"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/dynamicalobject.html Dynamical Object]\" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.</ref> All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the [[universe of discourse]] to which the partial or special object belongs.<ref name=fictive/> For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto. An object either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' object, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded \"as on bedrock\".<ref>See \"Immediate Object\", etc., at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].</ref>\n# An ''[[interpretant]]'' (or ''interpretant sign'') is a sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect, an interpretation, human or otherwise. An interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's \"predecessor\" (the interpreted sign) as a sign of the same object. An interpretant either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is a kind of quality or possibility such as a word's usual meaning, or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' interpretant, such as a state of agitation, or (iii) is a ''final'' or ''normal'' interpretant, a sum of the lessons which a sufficiently considered sign ''would'' have as effects on practice, and with which an actual interpretant may at most coincide.\nSome of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.<ref name=collateral/>\n\n====Classes of signs====\nAmong Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]], via Peirce's three phenomenological [[#Theory of categories|categories]]: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation.<ref name=9signs/>\n\nI. ''Qualisign, sinsign, legisign'' (also called'' tone, token, type,'' and also called ''potisign, actisign, famisign''):<ref name=terms>On the varying terminology, look up in [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].</ref> This typology classifies every sign according to the sign's own phenomenological category\u2014the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a \"First\"; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a \"Second\"; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a \"Third\".\n\nII. ''Icon, index, symbol'': This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign's way of denoting its object\u2014the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant.\n\nIII. ''Rheme, dicisign, argument'' (also called ''sumisign, dicisign, suadisign,'' also ''seme, pheme, delome,''<ref name=terms/> and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional ''term, proposition, argument''): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object\u2014the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.\n{{C. S. Peirce ninefold sign table}}\nEvery sign belongs to one class or another within (I) ''and'' within (II) ''and'' within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.\n\n===Modes of inference===\n{{Main article|Inquiry}}\nBorrowing a brace of concepts from [[Aristotle]], Peirce examined three basic modes of [[inference]]\u2014''[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]''\u2014in his \"critique of arguments\" or \"logic proper\". Peirce also called abduction \"retroduction\", \"presumption\", and, earliest of all, \"hypothesis\". He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis. He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical [[Syllogism#Barbara (AAA-1)|syllogism Barbara (AAA)]], for example in \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" (1878).<ref>''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 13, pp. 470\u2013482, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=u8sWAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA472 472] or [[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 13/August 1878/Illustrations of the Logic of Science VI|the book at Wikisource]]. ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 2.619\u2013644, see 623.</ref> He does this by rearranging the ''rule'' (Barbara's major premise), the ''case'' (Barbara's minor premise), and the ''result'' (Barbara's conclusion):\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\nDeduction.\n\n''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. <br>\n''Case:'' These beans are beans from this bag. <br>\n<math>\\therefore</math> ''Result:'' These beans are white.\n{{col-break|gap=1%}}\nInduction.\n\n''Case:'' These beans are &#91;randomly selected&#93; from this bag. <br>\n''Result:'' These beans are white. <br>\n<math>\\therefore</math> ''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white.\n{{col-break|gap=1%}}\nHypothesis (Abduction).\n\n''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. <br>\n''Result:'' These beans [oddly] are white. <br>\n<math>\\therefore</math> ''Case:'' These beans are from this bag.\n{{col-end}}\n\nPeirce 1883 in \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'') equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before<ref name=SCFI/>). Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought.

Here is one of his more [[Pragmatic maxim#2|emphatic reiterations]] of it:\n\n{{quote|Consider what effects that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have. Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object.}}\n\nAs a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, [[William James]], and others in [[the Metaphysical Club]]. James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as \"[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]\" (1877) and especially \"[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]\" (1878) as foundational to [[pragmatism]].<ref>James, William (1897), ''The Will to Believe'', see p. 124.</ref> Peirce (CP 5.11\u201312), like James (''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems. Peirce differed from James and the early [[John Dewey]], in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.\n\nIn 1905 Peirce coined the new name [[pragmaticism]] \"for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition\", saying that \"all went happily\" with James's and [[F.C.S. Schiller]]'s variant uses of the old name \"pragmatism\" and that he coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in \"literary journals, where it gets abused\". Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author [[Giovanni Papini]]'s declaration of pragmatism's indefinability. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.<ref>See [[Pragmaticism#Pragmaticism's name]] for discussion and references.</ref>\n\nPragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series of articles. In the second one, \"[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]\", Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:\n# Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used, even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.\n# Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea \"distinct\", that is, clarified by analysis of just what makes it applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce called a likewise distinct definition \"nominal\" (CP 5.553).\n# Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's conceived effects, such as fosters fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduced that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]].\n\nBy way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the [[#Presuppositions of logic|presuppositions of reasoning]] in general. In clearness's second grade (the \"nominal\" grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite [[Community of inquiry|community of inquirers]] think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which ''would'' be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion\u2014a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.<ref name=Induction>\"That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead\", in Peirce (1878 April), \"The Probability of Induction\", p.

His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to \"vulgar\" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and [[Machiavelli]]an search for mercenary or political advantage.

Also important: ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.497-525.</ref> treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy]] with a [[fallibilism]] that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all.\n\n=====Rival methods of inquiry=====\nIn \"[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]\" (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal, quarrelsome, or [[hyperbolic doubt]], which he held to be fruitless. Peirce sketched '''four methods''' of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:\n# The method of '''tenacity''' (policy of sticking to initial belief) \u2014 which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion seems as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.\n# The method of '''authority''' \u2014 which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to withstand doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.\n# The method of the '''''a priori''''' \u2014 which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of \"what is agreeable to reason.\" Thereby it depends on fashion in [[paradigm]]s and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.\n# The method of '''science''' \u2014 wherein inquiry supposes that the real is discoverable but independent of particular opinion, such that, unlike in the other methods, inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong ([[fallibilism]]), not only right, and thus purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.\n\nPeirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,<ref>Peirce, \"Philosophy and the Conduct of Life\", Lecture 1 of the 1898 Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.616\u2013648 in part and ''[[#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]'', 105\u2013122, reprinted in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:27\u201341.</ref> which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's \"first rule\"<ref name=FRL/> is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. [[Scientific method]] excels over the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive \u2014 eventually \u2014 at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.\n\n=====Scientific method=====\nInsofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] from self-evident truths, or ''[[rationalism]]''; and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from experiential phenomena, or ''[[empiricism]]''.\n\nBased on his critique of three [[#Modes of inference|modes of argument]] and different from either [[foundationalism]] or [[coherentism]], Peirce's approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry:\n\n# Active, [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] genesis of theory, with no prior assurance of truth;\n# Deductive application of the contingent theory so as to clarify its practical implications;\n# Inductive testing and evaluation of the utility of the provisional theory in anticipation of future experience, in both senses: ''[[prediction]]'' and ''control''.\n\nThereby, Peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization ''simpliciter'', which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the [[scientific method]] was proposed as an [[epistemology]] for philosophical questions.\n\nA theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists.\n\nPeirce extracted the pragmatic [[mental model|model]] or [[theory]] of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning.\n\nAbduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective [[modularity (programming)|modularity]] of its principal components.\n\nPeirce's outline of the scientific method in \u00a7III\u2013IV of \"A Neglected Argument\"<ref name=NA>Peirce (1908), \"[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]\", published in large part, ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, 90\u2013112.

There he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision (issues of [[#Modes of inference|critique of arguments]]).\n\n1. '''Abductive''' (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the \"facile and natural\", as by [[Galileo]]'s natural light of reason and as distinct from \"logical simplicity\".<ref>See also Nubiola, Jaime (2004), \"[http://www.unav.es/users/LumeNaturale.html Il Lume Naturale: Abduction and God]\", ''Semiotiche'' I/2, 91\u2013102.</ref> Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference.

Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}</ref> The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if not costly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [[Subjective probability|subjective likelihood]], though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be selected for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of [[Twenty Questions]]), breadth, or incomplexity.<ref>Peirce, C. S., \"On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents\", ''The Essential Peirce'', 2, see 107-109.

'''Deductive''' phase. Two stages:\n:i. Explication. Not clearly premised, but a deductive analysis of the hypothesis so as to render its parts as clear as possible.\n:ii. Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, [[Euclid]]ean in procedure. Explicit deduction of consequences of the hypothesis as predictions about evidence to be found. [[Corollary|Corollarial]] or, if needed, Theorematic.\n\n3. '''Inductive''' phase. Evaluation of the hypothesis, inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real \"is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead\";<ref name=Induction/> in other words, anything excluding such a process would never be real. Induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows \"a method which, sufficiently persisted in,\" will \"diminish the error below any predesignate degree.\" Three stages:\n:i. Classification. Not clearly premised, but an inductive classing of objects of experience under general ideas.\n:ii. Probation: direct Inductive Argumentation. Crude or Gradual in procedure. Crude Induction, founded on experience in one mass (CP 2.759), presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience (CP 2.756). Gradual Induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test, and is Qualitative or Quantitative. Qualitative Gradual Induction depends on estimating the relative evident weights of the various qualities of the subject class under investigation (CP 2.759; see also ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 7.114\u2013120). Quantitative Gradual Induction depends on how often, in a fair sample of instances of ''S'', ''S'' is found actually accompanied by ''P'' that was predicted for ''S'' (CP 2.758). It depends on measurements, or statistics, or counting.\n:iii. Sentential Induction. \"...which, by Inductive reasonings, appraises the different Probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result\".\n\n=====Against Cartesianism=====\nPeirce drew on the methodological implications of the [[#Four incapacities|four incapacities]] \u2014 no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable \u2014 to attack philosophical [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Cartesianism]], of which he said that:<ref name=SCFI />\n\n1. \"It teaches that philosophy must begin in universal doubt\" \u2014 when, instead, we start with preconceptions, \"prejudices [...] which it does not occur to us ''can'' be questioned\", though we may find reason to question them later. \"Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts.\"\n\n2. \"It teaches that the ultimate test of certainty is...in the individual consciousness\" \u2014 when, instead, in science a theory stays on probation till agreement is reached, then it has no actual doubters left.

It trusts to \"a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses\" \u2014 when, instead, philosophy should, \"like the successful sciences\", proceed only from tangible, scrutinizable premisses and trust not to any one argument but instead to \"the multitude and variety of its arguments\" as forming, not a chain at least as weak as its weakest link, but \"a cable whose fibers\", soever \"slender, are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected\".\n\n4.

His examples included [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]]'s ''[[Alexander Von Humboldt#The \"Cosmos\"|Cosmos]]'', [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s ''Philosophie positive'', and [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]]'s ''Synthetic Philosophy''.\n# Practical Science, or the Arts.\n\nPeirce placed, within Science of Review, the work and theory of classifying the sciences (including mathematics and philosophy). His classifications, on which he worked for many years, draw on argument and wide knowledge, and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath's survey of research in his time.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Charles Sanders Peirce's type\u2013token distinction]]\n* [[Continuous predicate]]\n* [[Entitative graph]]\n* [[Hypostatic abstraction]]\n* [[Idea#Charles Sanders Peirce]]\n* [[Laws of Form]]\n* [[List of American philosophers]]\n* [[Logic of information]]\n* [[Logical machine]]\n* [[Logical matrix]]\n* [[Mathematical psychology]]\n* [[Normal distribution#Naming]]\n* [[Peirce triangle]]\n* [[Peirce's law]]\n* [[Peircean realism]]\n* [[Phaneron]]\n* [[Pragmatics]]\n* [[Problem of universals#Peirce]]\n* [[Quantification (science)#History]]\n* [[Relation algebra]]\n* [[Truth table]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Contemporaries associated with Peirce'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]\n* [[Howland will forgery trial]]\n* [[Allan Marquand]]\n* [[George Herbert Mead]]\n* [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/nubiola/reyes.htm Ventura de los Reyes Pr\u00f3sper]\n* [[Thorstein Veblen]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|v=no|b=no|n=no|wikt=no|species=no|m=no|mw=no|c=Category:Charles Sanders Peirce}}\n* [http://www.cspeirce.com/ Arisbe: The Peirce Gateway], Joseph Ransdell, ed.

Also, the diagram shows an unlabeled axial rod attached to the outside of the piston.</ref> ]]\nA '''Carnot heat engine'''<ref>In French, Carnot uses ''machine \u00e0 feu'', which Thurston translates as ''heat-engine'' or ''steam-engine''. In a footnote, Carnot distinguishes the steam-engine (''machine \u00e0 vapeur'') from the heat-engine in general. (Carnot, 1824, p. 5 and Carnot, 1890, p. 43)</ref> is a theoretical engine that operates on the reversible [[Carnot cycle]]. The basic model for this engine was developed by [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot]] in 1824.  The Carnot engine model was graphically expanded upon by [[Beno\u00eet Paul \u00c9mile Clapeyron]] in 1834 and mathematically explored by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1857 from which the concept of [[entropy]] emerged.\n\nEvery thermodynamic system exists in a particular [[thermodynamic state|state]]. A [[thermodynamic cycle]] occurs when a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is taken through a series of different states, and finally returned to its initial state. In the process of going through this cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, thereby acting as a [[heat engine]].\n\nA heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and, in the process, converting some of that energy to [[mechanical work]]. The cycle may also be reversed. The system may be worked upon by an external force, and in the process, it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one, thereby acting as a [[refrigerator]] or [[heat pump]] rather than a heat engine.\n\n== Carnot's diagram ==\nIn the adjacent diagram, from Carnot's 1824 work, ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'',<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3AReflections+on+the+motive+power+of+heat+au%3Acarnot Sometimes translated as ''Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat'']</ref> there are \"two bodies ''A'' and ''B'', kept each at a constant temperature, that of ''A'' being higher than that of ''B''.  These two bodies to which we can give, or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of [[Caloric theory|caloric]].  We will call the first the [[furnace]] and the second the refrigerator.\u201d<ref>English translation by Thurston (Carnot, 1890, p. 51-52).</ref> Carnot then explains how we can obtain [[motive power]], i.e., \u201cwork\u201d, by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body ''A'' to body ''B''.\nIt also acts as a cooler and hence can also act as a Refrigerator.\n\n== Modern diagram ==\n[[File:Carnot heat engine 2.svg|300px|thumb|right|Carnot engine diagram (modern) - where an amount of heat ''Q''<sub>H</sub> flows from a high temperature ''T''<sub>H</sub> furnace through the fluid of the \"working body\" (working substance) and the remaining heat ''Q''<sub>C</sub> flows into the cold sink ''T''<sub>C</sub>, thus forcing the working substance to do [[mechanical work]] ''W'' on the surroundings, via cycles of contractions and expansions.]]\n\nThe previous image shows the original piston-and-cylinder diagram used by Carnot in discussing his ideal engines.  The figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine, such as the Carnot engine.  In the diagram, the \u201cworking body\u201d (system), a term introduced by Clausius in 1850, can be any fluid or vapor body through which [[heat]] ''Q'' can be introduced or transmitted to produce work.  Carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion, such as vapor of water, vapor of alcohol, vapor of mercury, a permanent gas, or air, etc.  Although, in these early years, engines came in a number of configurations, typically ''Q''<sub>H</sub> was supplied by a boiler, wherein water was boiled over a furnace; ''Q''<sub>C</sub> was typically supplied by a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] located on a separate part of the engine.  The output work ''W'' here is the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm, which was then typically used to turn a pulley so to lift water out of flooded salt mines.  Carnot defined work as \u201cweight lifted through a height\u201d.\n\n<!-- Until this section text gets longer, please leave this space for the right-justified image -->\n\n==Carnot cycle==\n[[File:Carnot cycle p-V diagram.svg|400px|thumb|Figure 1: A Carnot cycle illustrated on a [[PV diagram]] to illustrate the work done.]]\n[[File:Carnot Cycle T-S diagram.svg|400px|thumb|Figure 2: A Carnot cycle acting as a heat engine, illustrated on a temperature-entropy diagram. The cycle takes place between a hot reservoir at temperature T<sub>H</sub> and a cold reservoir at temperature T<sub>C</sub>. The vertical axis is temperature, the horizontal axis is entropy.]]\n\n{{main|Carnot cycle}}\n\nThe '''Carnot cycle''' when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps:\n\n#'''Reversible [[isothermal]] expansion of the gas at the \"hot\" temperature, ''T''<sub>H</sub> (isothermal heat addition or absorption).''' During this step (1 to 2 on Figure 1, ''A'' to ''B'' in Figure 2) the gas is allowed to expand and it does work on the surroundings. The temperature of the gas does not change during the process, and thus the expansion is isothermic.  The gas expansion is propelled by absorption of heat energy ''Q''<sub>1</sub> and of entropy <math>\\Delta S_\\text{H}=Q_\\text{H}/T_\\text{H}</math> from the high temperature reservoir.\n#'''[[Isentropic process|Isentropic]] ([[Reversible adiabatic process|reversible adiabatic]]) expansion of the gas (isentropic work output).''' For this step (2 to 3 on Figure 1, ''B'' to ''C'' in Figure 2) the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated, thus they neither gain nor lose heat.  The gas continues to expand, doing work on the surroundings, and losing an equivalent amount of internal energy.  The gas expansion causes it to cool to the \"cold\" temperature, ''T''<sub>C</sub>. The entropy remains unchanged.\n#'''Reversible isothermal compression of the gas at the \"cold\" temperature, ''T''<sub>C</sub>. (isothermal heat rejection)''' (3 to 4 on Figure 1, ''C'' to ''D'' on Figure 2) Now the gas is exposed to the cold temperature reservoir while the surroundings do work on the gas by compressing it (such as through the return compression of a piston), while causing an amount of heat energy ''Q''<sub>2</sub> and of entropy <math>\\Delta S_\\text{C}=Q_\\text{C}/T_\\text{C}</math> to flow out of the gas to the low temperature reservoir. (This is the same amount of entropy absorbed in step 1.)  This work is less than the work performed on the surroundings in step 1 because it occurs at a lower pressure given the removal of heat to the cold reservoir as the compression occurs (i.e. the resistance to compression is lower under step 3 than the force of expansion under step 1).\n#'''Isentropic compression of the gas (isentropic work input).''' (4 to 1 on Figure 1, ''D'' to ''A'' on Figure 2) Once again the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated and the cold temperature reservoir is removed. During this step, the surroundings continue to do work to further compress the gas and both the temperature and pressure rise now that the heat sink has been removed. This additional work increases the internal energy of the gas, compressing it and causing the temperature to rise to ''T''<sub>H</sub>.  The entropy remains unchanged.  At this point the gas is in the same state as at the start of step 1.\n\n== Carnot's theorem ==\n{{main|Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)}}\n[[File:Real vs Carnot.svg|500px|thumb|right|real ideal engines (left) compared to the Carnot cycle (right). The entropy of a real material changes with temperature. This change is indicated by the curve on a [[Temperature entropy diagram|T-S diagram]]. For this figure, the curve indicates a vapor-liquid equilibrium (''See [[Rankine cycle]]''). Irreversible systems and losses of heat (for example, due to friction) prevent the ideal from taking place at every step.]]\n\n'''Carnot's theorem''' is a formal statement of this fact: ''No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.''\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\eta_\\text{I}=\\frac{W}{Q_\\text{H}}=1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\n</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\n'''Explanation''' <br />\nThis maximum efficiency <math>\\eta_\\text{I}</math> is defined as above:\n: {{mvar|W}} is the work done by the system (energy exiting the system as work),\n: <math> Q_\\text{H} </math> is the heat put into the system (heat energy entering the system),\n: <math> T_\\text{C} </math> is the [[absolute temperature]] of the cold reservoir, and\n: <math> T_\\text{H} </math> is the [[absolute temperature]] of the hot reservoir.\n\nA corollary to Carnot's theorem states that: All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient.\n\nIt is easily shown that the efficiency {{mvar|&eta;}} is maximum when the entire cyclic process is a [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. This means the total [[entropy]] of the net system (the entropies of the hot furnace, the \"working fluid\" of the Heat engine, and the cold sink) remains constant when the \"working fluid\" completes one cycle and returns to its original state. (In the general case, the total entropy of this combined system would increase in a general irreversible process).\n\nSince the \"working fluid\" comes back to the same state after one cycle, and entropy of the system is a state function; the change in entropy of the \"working fluid\" system is 0. Thus, it implies that the total entropy change of the furnace and sink is zero, for the process to be reversible and the efficiency of the engine to be maximum. This derivation is carried out in the next section.\n\nThe [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency.\n\n== Efficiency of real heat engines ==\n\nFor a real heat engine, the total thermodynamic process is generally irreversible. The working fluid is brought back to its initial state after one cycle, and thus the change of entropy of the fluid system is 0, but the sum of the entropy changes in the hot and cold reservoir in this one cyclical process is greater than 0.\n\nThe internal energy of the fluid is also a state variable, so its total change in one cycle is 0. So the total work done by the system {{mvar|W}}, is equal to the heat put into the system <math> Q_\\text{H} </math> minus the heat taken out <math> Q_\\text{C} </math>.\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C} </math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nFor real engines, sections 1 and 3 of the Carnot Cycle; in which heat is absorbed by the \"working fluid\" from the hot reservoir, and released by it to the cold reservoir, respectively; no longer remain ideally reversible, and there is a temperature differential between the temperature of the reservoir and the temperature of the fluid while heat exchange takes place.\n\nDuring heat transfer from the hot reservoir at <math>T_\\text{H}</math> to the fluid, the fluid would have a slightly lower temperature than <math>T_\\text{H}</math>, and the process for the fluid may not necessarily remain isothermal. \nLet <math>\\Delta S_\\text{H}</math> be the total entropy change of the fluid in the process of intake of heat. \n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\Delta S_\\text{H}=\\int_{Q_\\text{in}} \\frac{\\text{d}Q_\\text{H}}{T} </math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nwhere the temperature of the fluid {{mvar|T}} is always slightly lesser than <math>T_\\text{H}</math>, in this process.\n\nSo, one would get \n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\frac{Q_\\text{H}}{T_\\text{H}}=\\frac{\\int \\text{d}Q_\\text{H}}{T_\\text{H}} \\leq \\Delta S_\\text{H}   </math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nSimilarly, at the time of heat injection from the fluid to the cold reservoir one would have, for the magnitude of total entropy change <math> \\Delta S_\\text{C} </math> of the fluid in the process of expelling heat:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\Delta S_\\text{C}=\\int_{Q_\\text{out}} \\frac{\\text{d}Q_\\text{C}}{T} \\leq \\frac{\\int \\text{d}Q_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{C}}=\\frac{Q_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{C}} </math>,  |{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nwhere, during this process of transfer of heat to the cold reservoir, the temperature of the fluid {{mvar|T}} is always slightly greater than <math>T_\\text{C}</math>.\n\nWe have only considered the magnitude of the entropy change here. Since the total change of entropy of the fluid system for the cyclic process is 0, we must have\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\Delta S_\\text{H}=\\Delta S_\\text{C}  </math>      |{{EquationRef|6}}}}\n\nThe previous three equations combine to give:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\frac{Q_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{C}} \\geq  \\frac{Q_\\text{H}}{T_\\text{H}}</math>        |{{EquationRef|7}}}}\n\nEquations ({{EquationNote|2}}) and ({{EquationNote|7}}) combine to give \n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\frac{W}{Q_\\text{H}} \\leq 1- \\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}} </math>|{{EquationRef|8}}}}\n\nHence,\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\eta \\leq \\eta_\\text{I} </math>|{{EquationRef|9}}}}\n\nwhere <math>\\eta = \\frac{W}{Q_\\text{H}}</math> is the efficiency of the real engine, and <math>\\eta_\\text{I}</math> is the efficiency of the Carnot engine working between the same two reservoirs at the temperatures <math>T_\\text{H}</math> and <math>T_\\text{C}</math>. For the Carnot engine, the entire process is 'reversible', and Equation ({{EquationNote|7}}) is an equality.\n\nHence, the efficiency of the real engine is always less than the ideal Carnot engine.\n\nEquation ({{EquationRef|7}}) signifies that the total entropy of the total system(the two reservoirs + fluid) increases for the real engine, because the entropy gain of the cold reservoir as <math>Q_\\text{C}</math> flows into it at the fixed temperature <math>T_\\text{C}</math>, is greater than the entropy loss of the hot reservoir as <math>Q_\\text{H}</math> leaves it at its fixed temperature <math>T_\\text{H}</math>. The inequality in Equation ({{EquationNote|7}}) is essentially the statement of the [[Clausius theorem]].\n\nAccording to the second theorem, \"The efficiency of the Carnot engine is independent of the nature of the working substance\".\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--\n[[Template:Cite book]]\n*{{cite book |title= |last= |first= |authorlink= |edition= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages= }}\n-->\n*{{cite book |title=R\u00e9flexions sur la puissance motrice du feu et sur les machines propres \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper cette puissance |last=Carnot |first=Sadi |authorlink=Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot |year=1824 |publisher=Bachelier |location=Paris |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QX9iIWF3yOMC |language=fr}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=QX9iIWF3yOMC First Edition 1824]) and ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YcY9AAAAMAAJ Reissue of 1878])\n*{{cite book |title=Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat and on Machines Fitted to Develop That Power |last=Carnot |first=Sadi |authorlink= |editor=[[Robert Henry Thurston|Thurston, Robert Henry]] |year=1890 |publisher=J.

Central America is bordered by [[Mexico]] to the north, [[Colombia]] to the southeast, the [[Caribbean Sea]] to the east, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west and south. Central America consists of seven countries: [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Panama]].  The combined population of Central America has been estimated to be 41,739,000 (2009 estimate)<ref name=handbook2013/> and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate).<ref name=IndexMundi2012/>\n\nCentral America is a part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n [[biodiversity hotspot]], which extends from northern Guatemala through to central Panama. Due to the presence of several [[active fault|active geologic faults]] and the [[Central America Volcanic Arc]], there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region. [[Types of volcanic eruptions|Volcanic eruptions]] and earthquakes occur frequently; these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property.\n\nIn the [[Pre-Columbian era]], Central America was inhabited by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area|Isthmo-Colombian]] peoples to the south and east. Soon after Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages to the [[Americas]], the Spanish began to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonize the Americas]]. From 1609 until 1821, most of the territory within Central America\u2014except for the lands that would become Belize and Panama\u2014was governed by the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]] from [[Mexico City]] as the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. After New Spain achieved independence from Spain in 1821, some of its provinces were annexed to the [[First Mexican Empire]], but soon seceded from Mexico to form the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], which lasted from 1823 to 1838. The seven states finally became independent autonomous states: beginning with Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (1838); followed by El Salvador (1841); then Panama (1903); and finally Belize (1981). Even today, people in Central America sometimes refer to their nations as if they were provinces of a Central American state. For example, it is not unusual to write \"C.A.\" after the country names in formal and informal contexts and the automobile licence plates of many of the countries in the region show the legend  \"Centroamerica\" in addition to the country name.\n\n==Different definitions==\n\"Central America\" may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:\n* The [[United Nations geoscheme for the Americas]] defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States and specifically includes all of Mexico.<ref name=UN2013/> \n* [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] is usually thought to comprise [[Mexico]] to the north of the 7 states of ''Central America'' as well as [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] to the south.

While both can be translated into English as \"Central America\", \"Am\u00e9rica Central\" is generally used to refer to the geographical area of the seven countries between [[Mexico]] and [[Colombia]], while \"Centroam\u00e9rica\" is used when referring to the former members of the Federation emphasizing the shared culture and history of the region.\n* In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as a rule and occasionally in Spanish and other languages, the entirety of the [[Antilles]] is often included in the definition of Central America (the Portuguese Wikipedia article for the Antilles offers, in fact, {{lang|pt|Am\u00e9rica Central Insular}} as an alternative name), which is its own region to be distinguished from North America and South America alike.

Most notable among these were the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the [[Aztec]]s, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern [[El Salvador]], eastern [[Honduras]], Caribbean [[Nicaragua]], most of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] were predominantly speakers of the [[Chibchan languages]] at the time of European contact and are considered by some<ref name=\"Hoopes&Fonseca2003\"/> culturally different and grouped in the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area]].\n\nFollowing [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of [[Maya civilization|Maya territory]] in 1523. Soon after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Pedro de Alvarado]] commenced the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquest of northern Central America]] for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Beginning with his arrival in [[Soconusco]] in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche']], [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]], [[Pipil people|Pipil]], and the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]]. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]] remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms \u2013 the [[Kowoj]] and the [[Itza people]] \u2013 were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the [[Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 1538, Spain established the [[Real Audiencia of Panama#First installation|Real Audiencia of Panama]], which had jurisdiction over all land from the [[Strait of Magellan]] to the [[Gulf of Fonseca]]. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the ''[[Real Audiencia of Guatemala|Audiencia Real de Guatemala]]''. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in [[Antigua Guatemala]], was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a [[Captaincies of the Spanish Empire|captaincy general]] and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of [[British Honduras|present-day Belize]] and Panama.\n\nThe Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a [[1811 Independence Movement|rebellion in 1811]] which began in the [[Intendant#Spain and the Spanish Empire|intendancy]] of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the [[Act of Independence of Central America]]. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] and the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire]], and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.\n\nFrom its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived [[First Mexican Empire]]. When the [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide|Emperor of Mexico]] abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe Federal Republic of Central America was a [[representative democracy]] with its capital at [[Guatemala City]]. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]], [[Mosquito Coast]], and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=2 widths=100 heights=100 mode=nolines caption=\"Historic Coat of Arms of Central American Unions\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Escudo de las Provincias Unidas del Centro de Am\u00e9rica.svg|The United Provinces of Central America\nFile:Coat of arms of the United Provinces of Central America.svg|United Provinces of Central America\nFile:Escudo de la Rep\u00fablica Federal de Centro Am\u00e9rica.svg|[[Federal Republic of Central America]]\nFile:Coat of arms of the Greater Republic of Central America (1898).svg|[[Greater Republic of Central America]]\n</gallery>\n}}\n\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=3 widths=80 heights=80 mode=nolines caption=\"Coat of Arms of modern Central America\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Coat of arms of Guatemala.svg|[[Guatemala]]\nFile:Actualescudodsalvadore\u00f1o.png|[[El Salvador]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Honduras.svg|[[Honduras]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Nicaragua.svg|[[Nicaragua]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Costa Rica.svg|[[Costa Rica]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Panama.svg|[[Panama]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Belize.svg|[[Belize]]\n</gallery>\n}}\nThe territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence (see [[History of Belize (1506\u20131862)]].

It became independent as Belize in 1981.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nPanama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the [[Isthmus of Panama]], has for most of its history been culturally linked to South America. Panama was part of the [[Province of Tierra Firme]] from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed ''Audiencia Real de Panama''. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], the capital of which was located at [[Bogot\u00e1|Santa F\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1]]. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of [[Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada|military and political struggles]] took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the [[Republic of New Granada]]. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as [[Panama State]], first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the [[Granadine Confederation]], and finally within the [[United States of Colombia]]. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the [[Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the [[Isthmus Department]]. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|secession of Panama]] on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nBy the 1930s the [[United Fruit Company]] owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala.

The underlying problems are [[deforestation]], which is estimated by [[FAO]] at 1.2% per year in Central America and Mexico combined, [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of [[rainforest]]s and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture.<ref name=Harvey2008/>\n\nEfforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating [[ecoregion]]s and nature reserves. 36% of Belize's land territory falls under some form of official protected status, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. In addition, 13% of Belize's marine territory are also protected.<ref name=Ramos2010/> A large coral reef extends from Mexico to Honduras: the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]]. The [[Belize Barrier Reef]] is part of this. The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse [[ecosystem]]s of the world.

In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest [[biome]], with {{convert|12201|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with {{convert|4730|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, and a gain in the dry forest biome at {{convert|2054|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the [[Deforestation in Central America|deforestation]] was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of {{convert|8574|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of {{convert|3050|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.<ref name=Redo2012/>\n\nThe [[Central American pine-oak forests]] ecoregion, in the [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]] biome, is found in Central America and southern Mexico. The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of {{convert|111400|km2|sqmi|sp=us}},<ref name=WWF0303/> extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]] in Mexico's [[Chiapas]] state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between {{convert|600|-|1800|m|ft}} elevation,<ref name=WWF0303/> and are surrounded at lower elevations by [[tropical moist forests]] and [[tropical dry forests]]. Higher elevations above {{convert|1800|m|ft}} are usually covered with [[Central American montane forests]]. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including [[oak]], [[pine]], [[fir]], and [[cypress]].\n\n[[Laurel forest]] is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen [[cloud forest]], found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than {{convert|1000|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level. Tree species include [[evergreen oak]]s, members of the [[Laurus|laurel family]], and species of ''[[Weinmannia]]'', ''[[Drimys]]'', and ''[[Magnolia]]''.<ref name=WWF0167/> The cloud forest of [[Sierra de las Minas]], Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the [[Mombacho]] volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de [[Tilar\u00e1n]] and [[Volc\u00e1n Arenal]], called [[Monteverde]], also in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]].\n\nThe [[Central American montane forests]] are an ecoregion of the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] biome, as defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]].<ref name=WWF0112/> These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer [[wet season]] and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from {{convert|1800|-|4000|m|ft}}, on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua. The entire ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|13200|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} and has a [[temperate climate]] with relatively high [[precipitation]] levels.<ref name=WWF0112/>\n\n===Fauna===\n{{see also|List of Central American mammals|List of Central American monkey species}}\n\nEcoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the [[Talamancan montane forests]] in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the [[resplendent quetzal]] (Pharomacrus mocinno), [[three-wattled bellbird]] (Procnias tricarunculata), [[bare-necked umbrellabird]] (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and [[black guan]] (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The [[golden toad]] that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extincition are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. [[Jaguar]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[spider monkey]]s, as well as [[tapir]]s, and [[anteater]]s live in the woods of Central America.<ref name=WWF0167/> The [[Central American red brocket]] is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Tectonic plates Caribbean.png|thumb|Central America and the [[Caribbean Plate]]]]\n{{see also|Central America Volcanic Arc|List of earthquakes in Costa Rica|List of earthquakes in El Salvador|List of earthquakes in Guatemala|List of earthquakes in Nicaragua}}\n\nCentral America is geologically very active, with [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]] and earthquakes occurring frequently, and [[tsunami]]s occurring occasionally. Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.\n\nMost of Central America rests atop the [[Caribbean Plate]]. This [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] converges with the [[Cocos Plate|Cocos]], [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]], and [[North American Plate|North American]] plates to form the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[Subduction|subduction zone]]. The Middle America Trench is situated some {{convert|60-160|km|mi|sp=us}} off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.<ref name=Astiz1987/> For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]] that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1942 Guatemala earthquake|1942]], [[1956 Nicaragua earthquake|1956]], [[1982 El Salvador earthquake|1982]], [[1992 Nicaragua earthquake|1992]], [[2001 El Salvador earthquakes|2001]], [[2007 Guatemala earthquake|2007]], [[2012 Guatemala earthquake|2012]], [[October 2014 Nicaragua earthquake|2014]], and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.\n\nThe Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The [[Motagua Fault]] is an onshore continuation of the [[Cayman Trough]] which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This [[transform fault]] cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near [[Acapulco]]. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in [[1717 Guatemala earthquake|1717]], [[1773 Guatemala earthquake|1773]], [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976]], [[1980 Honduras earthquake|1980]], and [[2009 Honduras earthquake|2009]].\n\nAnother onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the [[Chixoy-Polochic Fault]], which runs parallel to, and roughly {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.<ref name=White1985/>\n\n[[Managua]], the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|1931]] and [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972]].\n\nVolcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the [[Arenal Volcano]], in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{see also|Ethnic groups in Central America|Latin Americans}}\n\nThe population of Central America is estimated at 47,448,333<!-- 2016 --> as of {{UN_Population|Year}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} With an area of {{convert|523780|km2|sqmi|sp=us}},<ref name=handbook2013/> it has a population density of {{convert|81|/km2|/sqmi|sp=us}}.

However, the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states.\n\nIn 1991, the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the [[Central American Integration System]] (''Sistema para la Integraci\u00f3n Centroamericana'', or SICA). SICA provides a clear legal basis to avoid disputes between the member states. SICA membership includes the 7 nations of Central America plus the [[Dominican Republic]], a state that is traditionally considered part of the Caribbean.\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=3 widths=70 heights=70 mode=nolines caption=\"Central American flags\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Nuvola Guatemalan flag.svg|[[Guatemala]]\nFile:Nuvola Salvadoran flag.svg|[[El Salvador]]\nFile:Nuvola Honduran flag.svg|[[Honduras]]\nFile:Nuvola Nicaraguan flag.svg|[[Nicaragua]]\nFile:Nuvola Costa Rican state flag.svg|[[Costa Rica]]\nFile:Nuvola Panaman flag.svg|[[Panama]]\nFile:Nuvola Belizean flag.svg|[[Belize]]\n</gallery>\n}}\nOn 6 December 2008 SICA announced an agreement to pursue a common currency and common passport for the member nations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081206-central-american-leaders-agree-common-currency-|title=Central American leaders agree on common currency|work=France 24|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}</ref> No timeline for implementation was discussed.\n\nCentral America already has several supranational institutions such as the [[Central American Parliament]], the [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]] and the [[Central American Common Market]].\n\nOn 22 July 2011 President [[Mauricio Funes]] of El Salvador became the first president ''[[pro tempore]]'' to SICA.

The parliament started around 1980, and its primary goal was to resolve conflicts in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA. New members have since then joined including Panama and the Dominican Republic. Costa Rica is not a member State of the Central American Parliament and its adhesion remains as a very unpopular topic at all levels of the Costa Rican society due to existing strong political criticism towards the regional parliament, since it is regarded by Costa Rican as a menace to democratic accountability and effectiveness of integration efforts. Excessively high salaries for its members, legal immunity of jurisdiction from any member State, corruption, lack of a binding nature and effectiveness of the regional parliament's decisions, high operative costs and immediate membership of Central American Presidents once they leave their office and presidential terms, are the most common reasons invoked by Costa Ricans against the Central American Parliament.\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{see also|Economy of Belize|Economy of Costa Rica|Economy of El Salvador|Economy of Guatemala|Economy of Honduras|Economy of Nicaragua|Economy of Panama}}\nSigned in 2004, the [[Dominican Republic\u2013Central America Free Trade Agreement|Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) is an agreement between the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the [[Dominican Republic]].

Otherwise, a function is said to be a ''discontinuous'' function. A continuous function with a continuous [[inverse function]] is called a [[homeomorphism]].\n\nContinuity of functions is one of the core concepts of [[topology]], which is treated in full generality below. The introductory portion of this article focuses on the special case where the inputs and outputs of functions are [[real number]]s.  A stronger form of continuity is [[uniform continuity]]. In addition, this article discusses the definition for the more general case of functions between two [[metric space]]s. In [[order theory]], especially in [[domain theory]], one considers a notion of continuity known as [[Scott continuity]]. Other forms of continuity do exist but they are not discussed in this article.\n\nAs an example, consider the function ''h''(''t''), which describes the [[height]] of a growing flower at time ''t''. This function is continuous. By contrast, if ''M''(''t'') denotes the amount of money in a bank account at time ''t'', then the function jumps at each point in time when money is deposited or withdrawn, so the function ''M''(''t'') is discontinuous.\n\n==History==\n\nA form of the [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit|epsilon\u2013delta definition]] of continuity was first given by [[Bernard Bolzano]] in 1817. [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] defined continuity of <math>y=f(x)</math> as follows: an infinitely small increment <math>\\alpha</math> of the independent variable ''x'' always produces an infinitely small change <math>f(x+\\alpha)-f(x)</math> of the dependent variable ''y'' (see e.g. ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'', p.&nbsp;34). Cauchy defined infinitely small quantities in terms of variable quantities, and his definition of continuity closely parallels the infinitesimal definition used today (see [[microcontinuity]]). The formal definition and the distinction between pointwise continuity and [[uniform continuity]] were first given by Bolzano in the 1830s but the work wasn't published until the 1930s. Like Bolzano,<ref>{{citation|last1=Bolzano|first1=Bernard|title=Rein analytischer Beweis des Lehrsatzes dass zwischen je zwey Werthen, die ein entgegengesetztes Resultat gewaehren, wenigstens eine reele Wurzel der Gleichung liege|publisher=Haase|location=Prague|date=1817}}</ref> [[Karl Weierstrass]]<ref>{{Citation | last1=Dugac | first1=Pierre | title=El\u00e9ments d'Analyse de Karl Weierstrass | journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences | year=1973 | volume=10 | pages=41\u2013176 | doi=10.1007/bf00343406}}</ref> denied continuity of a function at a point ''c'' unless it was defined at and on both sides of ''c'', but [[\u00c9douard Goursat]]<ref>{{Citation | last1=Goursat | first1=E. | title=A course in mathematical analysis | publisher=Ginn | location=Boston | year=1904 | page=2}}</ref> allowed the function to be defined only at and on one side of ''c'', and [[Camille Jordan]]<ref>{{Citation | last1=Jordan | first1=M.C. | title=Cours d'analyse de l'\u00c9cole polytechnique | publisher=Gauthier-Villars | location=Paris | edition=2nd |year=1893 | volume=1|page=46}}</ref> allowed it even if the function was defined only at ''c''.

A more mathematically rigorous definition is given below.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://math.mit.edu/~jspeck/18.01_Fall%202014/Supplementary%20notes/01c.pdf | title=Continuity and Discontinuity | last1=Speck | first1=Jared | year=2014 | page=3 | access-date=2016-09-02 | website=MIT Math | quote=Example 5. The function 1/''x'' is continuous on (0, \u221e) and on (\u2212\u221e, 0), i.e., for ''x'' > 0 and for ''x'' < 0, in other words, at every point in its domain. However, it is not a continuous function since its domain is not an interval. It has a single point of discontinuity, namely ''x'' = 0, and it has an infinite discontinuity there.}}</ref>\n\nA rigorous definition of continuity of real functions is usually given in a first course in calculus in terms of the idea of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]. First, a function {{math|''f''}} with variable {{mvar|x}} is said to be continuous ''at the point'' {{math|c}} on the real line, if the limit of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, as {{mvar|x}} approaches that point {{math|c}}, is equal to the value {{math|''f''(c)}}; and second, the ''function (as a whole)'' is said to be ''continuous'', if it is continuous at every point. A function is said to be ''discontinuous'' (or to have a ''discontinuity'') at some point when it is not continuous there. These points themselves are also addressed as ''discontinuities''.\n\nThere are several different definitions of continuity of a function.  Sometimes a function is said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain.  In this case, the function {{math|''f''(''x'')&thinsp;{{=}}&thinsp;tan(''x'')}}, with the domain of all real {{math|''x'' \u2260 (2''n''+1)\u03c0/2}}, {{math|''n''}}&nbsp;any integer, is continuous. Sometimes an exception is made for boundaries of the domain. For example, the graph of the function {{math|''f''(''x'')&thinsp;{{=}}&thinsp;{{sqrt|''x''}}}}, with the domain of all non-negative reals, has a ''left-hand'' endpoint. In this case only the limit from the ''right'' is required to equal the value of the function. Under this definition ''f'' is continuous at the boundary {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and so for all non-negative arguments. The most common and restrictive definition is that a function is continuous if it is continuous at all real numbers.  In this case, the previous two examples are not continuous, but every [[polynomial]] function is continuous, as are the [[sine]], [[cosine]], and [[exponential functions]].  Care should be exercised in using the word ''continuous'', so that it is clear from the context which meaning of the word is intended.\n\nUsing mathematical notation, there are several ways to define continuous functions in each of the three senses mentioned above.\n\nLet\n:<math>f\\colon D \\rightarrow \\mathbf R \\quad</math> be a function defined on a [[subset]] <math> D </math> of the set <math>\\mathbf R</math> of real numbers.\n\nThis subset <math> D </math> is the [[domain of a function|domain]] of ''f''. Some possible choices include \n:<math>D = \\mathbf R \\quad </math> (<math> D </math> is the whole set of real numbers), or, for ''a'' and ''b'' real numbers,\n:<math>D = [a, b] = \\{x \\in \\mathbf R \\,|\\, a \\leq x \\leq b \\} \\quad </math> (<math> D </math> is a [[closed interval]]), or\n:<math>D = (a, b) = \\{x \\in \\mathbf R \\,|\\, a < x < b \\} \\quad </math> (<math> D </math> is an [[open interval]]).\n\nIn case of the domain <math>D</math> being defined as an open interval, <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are no boundaries in the above sense and the values of <math>f(a)</math> and <math>f(b)</math> do not matter for continuity on <math>D</math>.\n\n====Definition in terms of limits of functions====\nThe function ''f'' is ''continuous at some point'' ''c'' of its domain if the [[limit of a function|limit]] of ''f''(''x''), as ''x'' approaches ''c'' through the domain of ''f'',  exists and is equal to ''f''(''c'').<ref>{{Citation | last1=Lang | first1=Serge | author1-link=Serge Lang | title=Undergraduate analysis | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | edition=2nd | series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-387-94841-6 | year=1997}}, section II.4</ref> In mathematical notation, this is written as\n:<math>\\lim_{x \\to c}{f(x)} = f(c).</math>\nIn detail this means three conditions: first, ''f'' has to be defined at ''c'' (guaranteed by the requirement that ''c'' is in the domain of ''f''). Second, the limit on the left hand side of that equation has to exist.  Third, the value of this limit must equal ''f''(''c'').\n\n(We have here assumed that the domain of ''f'' does not have any [[isolated point]]s.  For example, an interval or union of intervals has no isolated points.)\n\n====Definition in terms of neighborhoods====\nA [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of a point ''c'' is a set that contains all points of the domain within some fixed distance of ''c''.  Intuitively, a function is continuous at a point ''c'' if the range of the restriction of ''f'' to a neighborhood of ''c'' shrinks to a single point ''f''(''c'') as the width of the neighborhood around ''c'' shrinks to zero.  More precisely, a function ''f'' is continuous at a point ''c'' of its domain if, for any neighborhood <math>N_1(f(c))</math> there is a neighborhood <math>N_2(c)</math> such that <math>f(x)\\in N_1(f(c))</math> whenever <math>x\\in N_2(c)</math>.\n\nThis definition only requires that the domain and the codomain are topological spaces and is thus the most general definition.  It follows from this definition that a function ''f'' is automatically continuous at every [[isolated point]] of its domain.  As a specific example, every real valued function on the set of integers is continuous.\n\n====Definition in terms of limits of sequences====\n[[File:Continuity of the Exponential at 0.svg|thumb|The sequence exp(1/''n'') converges to exp(0)]]\nOne can instead require that for any [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] <math>(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}</math> of points in the domain which [[convergent sequence|converges]] to ''c'', the corresponding sequence <math>\\left(f(x_n)\\right)_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}}</math> converges to ''f''(''c'').  In mathematical notation, <math>\\forall (x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}} \\subset D:\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n=c \\Rightarrow \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n)=f(c)\\,.</math>\n\n====Weierstrass and Jordan definitions (epsilon\u2013delta) of continuous functions====\n[[File:Example of continuous function.svg|right|thumb|Illustration of the \u03b5-\u03b4-definition: for \u03b5=0.5, c=2, the value \u03b4=0.5 satisfies the condition of the definition.]]\nExplicitly including the definition of the limit of a function, we obtain a self-contained definition:\nGiven a function  ''f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''D''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''R'' as above and an element ''x''<sub>0</sub> of the domain ''D'', ''f'' is said to be continuous at the point ''x''<sub>0</sub> when the following holds: For any number ''\u03b5''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, however small, there exists some number ''\u03b4''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that for all ''x'' in the domain of ''f'' with ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b4''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''\u03b4'', the value of ''f''(''x'') satisfies\n\n:<math> f(x_0) - \\varepsilon < f(x) < f(x_0) + \\varepsilon.</math>\n\nAlternatively written, continuity of ''f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''D''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''R'' at ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''D'' means that for every&nbsp;''\u03b5''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 there exists a ''\u03b4''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that for all ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''D''&nbsp;:\n\n:<math>| x - x_0 | < \\delta \\Rightarrow | f(x) - f(x_0) | < \\varepsilon. </math>\n\nMore intuitively, we can say that if we want to get all the ''f''(''x'') values to stay in some small [[topological neighbourhood|neighborhood]] around ''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>), we simply need to choose a small enough neighborhood for the ''x'' values around ''x''<sub>0</sub>. If we can do that no matter how small the ''f''(''x'') neighborhood is, then ''f'' is continuous at&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nIn modern terms, this is generalized by the definition of continuity of a function with respect to a [[basis (topology)|basis for the topology]], here the [[metric topology]].\n\nWeierstrass had required that the interval ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b4''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''\u03b4'' be entirely within the domain ''D'', but Jordan removed that restriction.\n\n====Definition in terms of control of the remainder====\nIn proofs and numerical analysis we often need to know how fast limits are converging, or in other words, control of the remainder. We can formalise this to a definition of continuity. \nA function <math>C: [0,\\infty) \\to [0,\\infty]</math> is called a control function if\n* ''C'' is non decreasing\n*<math> \\inf_{\\delta > 0} C(\\delta) = 0</math>\n\nA function ''f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''D''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''R''  is ''C''-continuous at ''x''<sub>0</sub> if \n::  <math>| f(x) - f(x_0)| \\le C(|x- x_0|)</math>  for all <math> x \\in D </math>\n\nA function is continuous in ''x''<sub>0</sub> if it is ''C''-continuous for some control function ''C''.\n\nThis approach leads naturally to refining the notion of  continuity by restricting the set of admissible control functions. For a given set of control functions <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> a function is <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>-continuous if it is <math>C</math>-continuous for some <math> C \\in \\mathcal{C}</math>. For example the [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz]] and [[H\u00f6lder continuous function]]s of exponent &alpha;  below are defined by the set of control functions \n::<math>\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{Lipschitz}} = \\{C |  C(\\delta) = K|\\delta| ,\\  K > 0\\} </math> \nrespectively  \n::<math>\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{H\u00f6lder}-\\alpha} =</math><math> \\{C | C(\\delta)  = K |\\delta|^\\alpha, \\ K > 0\\} </math>.\n\n====Definition using oscillation====\n[[File:Rapid Oscillation.svg|thumb|The failure of a function to be continuous at a point is quantified by its [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]].]]\nContinuity can also be defined in terms of [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]]: a function ''f'' is continuous at a point ''x''<sub>0</sub> if and only if its oscillation at that point is zero;<ref>''[http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/texts/TRENCH_REAL_ANALYSIS.PDF Introduction to Real Analysis],'' updated April 2010, William F. Trench, Theorem 3.5.2, p. 172</ref> in symbols, <math>\\omega_f(x_0) = 0.</math> A benefit of this definition is that it ''quantifies'' discontinuity: the oscillation gives how ''much'' the function is discontinuous at a point.\n\nThis definition is useful in [[descriptive set theory]] to study the set of discontinuities and continuous points \u2013 the continuous points are the intersection of the sets where the oscillation is less than ''\u03b5'' (hence a [[G-delta set|G<sub>\u03b4</sub> set]]) \u2013 and gives a very quick proof of one direction of the [[Lebesgue integrability condition]].<ref>''[http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/texts/TRENCH_REAL_ANALYSIS.PDF Introduction to Real Analysis],'' updated April 2010, William F. Trench, 3.5 \"A More Advanced Look at the Existence of the Proper Riemann Integral\", pp. 171\u2013177</ref>\n\nThe oscillation is equivalent to the ''\u03b5''-''\u03b4'' definition by a simple re-arrangement, and by using a limit ([[lim sup]], [[lim inf]]) to define oscillation: if (at a given point) for a given ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> there is no ''\u03b4'' that satisfies the ''\u03b5''-''\u03b4'' definition, then the oscillation is at least ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>, and conversely if for every ''\u03b5'' there is a desired ''\u03b4,'' the oscillation is 0. The oscillation definition can be naturally generalized to maps from a topological space to a metric space.\n\n====Definition using the hyperreals====\n[[Cauchy]] defined continuity of a function in the following intuitive terms: an [[infinitesimal]] change in the independent variable corresponds to an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable (see ''Cours d'analyse'', page 34). [[Non-standard analysis]] is a way of making this mathematically rigorous. The real line is augmented by the addition of infinite and infinitesimal numbers to form the [[hyperreal numbers]].  In nonstandard analysis, continuity can be defined as follows.\n\n:A real-valued function ''f'' is continuous at ''x'' if its natural extension to the hyperreals has the property that for all infinitesimal ''dx'', {{nowrap|''f''(''x''+''dx'') \u2212 ''f''(''x'')}} is infinitesimal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html|title=Elementary Calculus|work=wisc.edu}}</ref>\n\n(see [[microcontinuity]]).  In other words, an infinitesimal increment of the independent variable always produces to an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable, giving a modern expression to [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]'s definition of continuity.\n\n===Construction of continuous functions===\n[[File:Brent method example.svg|right|thumb|The graph of a [[cubic function]] has no jumps or holes. The function is continuous.]]\n\nChecking the continuity of a given function can be simplified by checking one of the above defining properties for the building blocks of the given function. It is straightforward to show that the sum of two functions, continuous on some domain, is also continuous on this domain. Given\n:<math>f, g\\colon D \\rightarrow \\mathbf R</math>,\n\nthen the ''sum of continuous functions''\n:<math>s = f + g</math> \n(defined  by <math>s(x) = f(x) + g(x)</math> for all <math>x\\in D</math>)\nis continuous in <math>D</math>.\n\nThe same holds for the ''product of continuous functions,''\n:<math>p = f \\cdot g</math>\n(defined by <math>p(x) = f(x) \\cdot g(x)</math> for all <math>x \\in D</math>)\nis continuous in <math>D</math>.\n\nCombining the above preservations of continuity and the continuity of [[constant function]]s and of the [[identity function]] <math>I(x) = x</math> {{nowrap|on <math>\\mathbf R</math>,}} one arrives at the continuity of all [[polynomial|polynomial function]]s {{nowrap|on <math>\\mathbf R</math>,}} such as\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''x''<sup>2</sup> - 5''x'' + 3}}\n(pictured on the right).\n\n[[File:Homografia.svg|right|thumb|The graph of a continuous [[rational function]]. The function is not defined for ''x''=\u22122. The vertical and horizontal lines are [[asymptote]]s.]]\n\nIn the same way it can be shown that the ''reciprocal of a continuous function'' \n:<math>r = 1/f</math>\n(defined by <math>r(x) = 1/f(x)</math> for all <math>x \\in D</math> such that <math>f(x) \\ne 0</math>)\nis continuous in <math>D\\smallsetminus \\{x:f(x) = 0\\}</math>.\n\nThis implies that, excluding the roots of <math>g</math>, the ''quotient of continuous functions'' \n:<math>q = f/g</math>\n(defined by <math>q(x) = f(x)/g(x)</math> for all <math>x \\in D</math>, such that <math>g(x) \\ne 0</math>)\nis also continuous on <math>D\\smallsetminus \\{x:g(x) = 0\\}</math>.\n\nFor example, the function (pictured)\n:<math>y(x) = \\frac {2x-1} {x+2}</math>\n\nis defined for all real numbers {{nowrap|''x'' \u2260 \u22122}} and is continuous at every such point. Thus it is a continuous function. The question of continuity at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} \u22122}} does not arise, since  {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} \u22122}} is not in the domain of ''y''. There is no continuous function ''F'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R''' that agrees with ''y''(''x'') for all {{nowrap|''x'' \u2260 \u22122}}.\n\n[[File:Si cos.svg|thumb|The sinc and the cos functions]]\n\nSince the function [[sine]] is continuous on all reals, the [[sinc function]] ''G''(''x'') = sin&nbsp;''x''/''x'', is defined and continuous for all real ''x'' \u2260 0. However, unlike the previous example, ''G'' ''can'' be extended to a continuous function on ''all'' real numbers, by ''defining'' the value ''G''(0) to be 1, which is the limit of ''G''(''x''), when ''x'' approaches 0, i.e.,\n: <math>G(0) = \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\sin x}{x} = 1.</math>\n\nThus, by setting\n:<math>\nG(x) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac {\\sin (x)}x & \\text{ if }x \\ne 0\\\\\n1 & \\text{ if }x = 0,\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nthe sinc-function becomes a continuous function on all real numbers. The term ''[[removable singularity]]'' is used in such cases, when (re)defining values of a function to coincide with the appropriate limits make a function continuous at specific points.\n\nA more involved construction of continuous functions is the [[function composition]]. Given two continuous functions\n:<math>\\quad g\\colon D_g \\subseteq \\mathbf R \\rightarrow R_g \\subseteq\\mathbf R\\quad\\text{and}\\quad f\\colon D_f \\subseteq \\mathbf R\\rightarrow R_f\\subseteq D_g,</math> \ntheir composition, denoted as\n<math>c = g \\circ f \\colon D_f \\rightarrow \\mathbf R</math>, and defined by <math>c(x) = g(f(x)),</math> is continuous.\n\nThis construction allows stating, for example, that\n: <math>e^{\\sin(\\ln x)}</math> is continuous for all <math>x > 0.</math>\n\n===Examples of discontinuous functions===\n[[File:Discontinuity of the sign function at 0.svg|thumb|300px|Plot of the signum function. It shows that <math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sgn\\left(\\tfrac 1n\\right) \\neq\\sgn\\left(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\tfrac 1n\\right)</math>. Thus, the signum function is discontinuous at 0 for point 2.1.3.]]\nAn example of a discontinuous function is the [[Heaviside step function]] <math>H</math>, defined by\n\n:<math>H(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{ if } x \\ge 0\\\\\n0 & \\text{ if } x < 0\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nPick for instance <math>\\varepsilon = 1/2</math>. Then there is no {{nowrap|<math>\\delta</math>-neighborhood}} around <math>x = 0</math>, i.e. no open interval <math>(-\\delta,\\;\\delta)</math> with <math>\\delta > 0,</math> that will force all the <math>H(x)</math> values to be within the {{nowrap|<math>\\varepsilon</math>-neighborhood}} of <math>H(0)</math>, i.e. within <math>(1/2,\\;3/2)</math>. Intuitively we can think of this type of discontinuity as a sudden [[Jump discontinuity|jump]] in function values.\n\nSimilarly, the [[sign function|signum]] or sign function\n:<math>\n\\sgn(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\;\\;\\ 1 & \\text{ if }x > 0\\\\\n\\;\\;\\ 0 & \\text{ if }x = 0\\\\\n-1 & \\text{ if }x < 0\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\nis discontinuous at <math>x = 0</math> but continuous everywhere else. Yet another example: the function\n:<math>f(x)=\\begin{cases}\n  \\sin\\left(x^{-2}\\right)&\\text{ if }x \\ne 0\\\\\n   0&\\text{ if }x = 0\n\\end{cases}</math>\nis continuous everywhere apart from <math>x = 0</math>.\n\n[[File:Thomae function (0,1).svg|200px|right|thumb|Point plot of Thomae's function on the interval (0,1). The topmost point in the middle shows f(1/2) = 1/2.]]\nBesides plausible continuities and discontinuities like above, there are also functions with a behavior, often coined [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]], for example, [[Thomae's function]],\n:<math>f(x)=\\begin{cases}\n1   &\\text{ if }x=0\\\\\n\\frac{1}{q}&\\text{ if }x=\\frac{p}{q}\\text{(in lowest terms) is a rational number}\\\\\n  0&\\text{ if }x\\text{ is irrational}.\n\\end{cases}</math>\nis continuous at all irrational numbers and discontinuous at all rational numbers. In a similar vein, [[Dirichlet's function]], the [[indicator function]] for the set of rational numbers,\n:<math>D(x)=\\begin{cases}\n  0&\\text{ if }x\\text{  is irrational } (\\in \\mathbb{R} \\smallsetminus \\mathbb{Q})\\\\\n  1&\\text{ if }x\\text{ is rational } (\\in \\mathbb{Q})\n\\end{cases}</math>\nis nowhere continuous.\n\n===Properties===\n\n====Intermediate value theorem====\nThe [[intermediate value theorem]] is an [[existence theorem]], based on the real number property of [[Real number#Completeness|completeness]], and states:\n\n: If the real-valued function ''f'' is continuous on the [[interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] and ''k'' is some number between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b''), then there is some number ''c'' in [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] such that ''f''(''c'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k''.\n\nFor example, if a child grows from 1&nbsp;m to 1.5&nbsp;m between the ages of two and six years, then, at some time between two and six years of age, the child's height must have been 1.25&nbsp;m.\n\nAs a consequence, if ''f'' is continuous on [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] and ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') differ in [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]], then, at some point ''c'' in [''a'',&nbsp;''b''], ''f''(''c'') must equal [[0 (number)|zero]].\n\n====Extreme value theorem====\nThe [[extreme value theorem]] states that if a function ''f'' is defined on a closed interval [''a'',''b''] (or any closed and bounded set) and is continuous there, then the function attains its maximum, i.e. there exists ''c''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;[''a'',''b''] with ''f''(''c'') \u2265 ''f''(''x'') for all ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']. The same is true of the minimum of ''f''. These statements are not, in general, true if the function is defined on an open interval (''a'',''b'') (or any set that is not both closed and bounded), as, for example, the continuous function ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'', defined on the open interval (0,1), does not attain a maximum, being unbounded above.\n\n====Relation to differentiability and integrability====\nEvery [[differentiable function]]\n:<math>f\\colon (a, b) \\rightarrow \\mathbf R</math>\nis continuous, as can be shown. The [[Theorem#Converse|converse]]  does not hold: for example, the [[absolute value]] function\n:<math>f(x)=|x| = \\begin{cases}\n  \\;\\;\\ x & \\text{ if }x \\geq 0\\\\\n  -x & \\text{ if }x < 0\n\\end{cases}</math>\nis everywhere continuous. However, it is not differentiable at ''x'' = 0 (but is so everywhere else). [[Weierstrass function|Weierstrass's function]] is also everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable.\n\nThe [[derivative]] ''f\u2032''(''x'') of a differentiable function ''f''(''x'') need not be continuous. If ''f\u2032''(''x'') is continuous, ''f''(''x'') is said to be continuously differentiable. The set of such functions is denoted ''C''<sup>1</sup>({{open-open|''a'',\u2009''b''}}). More generally, the set of functions\n:<math>f\\colon \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbf R</math>\n(from an open interval (or [[open subset]] of '''R''') \u03a9 to the reals) such that ''f'' is ''n'' times differentiable and such that the ''n''-th derivative of ''f'' is continuous is denoted ''C''<sup>''n''</sup>(\u03a9). See [[differentiability class]]. In the field of computer graphics, these three levels are sometimes called ''G''<sup>0</sup> (continuity of position), ''G''<sup>1</sup> (continuity of tangency), and ''G''<sup>2</sup> (continuity of curvature).\n\nEvery continuous function\n:<math>f\\colon [a, b] \\rightarrow \\mathbf R</math>\nis [[integrable function|integrable]] (for example in the sense of the [[Riemann integral]]). The converse does not hold, as the (integrable, but discontinuous) [[sign function]] shows.\n\n====Pointwise and uniform limits====\n[[File:Uniform continuity animation.gif|A sequence of continuous functions ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') whose (pointwise) limit function ''f''(''x'') is discontinuous.

The pointwise limit function need not be continuous, even if all functions ''f''<sub>''n''</sub> are continuous, as the animation at the right shows. However, ''f'' is continuous if all functions ''f''<sub>''n''</sub> are continuous and the sequence [[uniform convergence|converges uniformly]], by the [[uniform convergence theorem]]. This theorem can be used to show that the [[exponential function]]s, [[logarithm]]s, [[square root]] function, [[trigonometric function]]s are continuous.\n\n===Directional and semi-continuity===\n<div style=\"float:right;\">\n<gallery>Image:Right-continuous.svg|A right-continuous function\nImage:Left-continuous.svg|A left-continuous function</gallery></div>\nDiscontinuous functions may be discontinuous in a restricted way, giving rise to the concept of directional continuity (or right and left continuous functions) and [[semi-continuity]]. Roughly speaking, a function is ''right-continuous'' if no jump occurs when the limit point is approached from the right. Formally, ''f'' is said to be right-continuous at the point ''c'' if the following holds: For any number ''\u03b5''&nbsp;&gt; 0 however small, there exists some number ''\u03b4''&nbsp;&gt; 0 such that for all ''x'' in the domain with {{nowrap|''c'' &lt; ''x'' &lt; ''c'' + ''\u03b4''}}, the value of ''f''(''x'') will satisfy\n\n:<math> |f(x) - f(c)| < \\varepsilon.</math>\n\nThis is the same condition as for continuous functions, except that it is required to hold for ''x'' strictly larger than ''c'' only. Requiring it instead for all ''x'' with {{nowrap|''c'' \u2212 ''\u03b4'' &lt; ''x'' &lt; ''c''}} yields the notion of ''left-continuous'' functions. A function is continuous if and only if it is both right-continuous and left-continuous.\n\nA function ''f'' is ''[[Semi-continuity|lower semi-continuous]]'' if, roughly, any jumps that might occur only go down, but not up. That is, for any ''\u03b5''&nbsp;&gt; 0, there exists some number ''\u03b4''&nbsp;&gt; 0 such that for all ''x'' in the domain with {{nowrap|{{abs|x \u2212 c}} < ''\u03b4''}}, the value of ''f''(''x'') satisfies\n:<math>f(x) \\geq f(c) - \\epsilon.</math>\nThe reverse condition is ''[[Semi-continuity|upper semi-continuity]]''.\n\n==Continuous functions between metric spaces== <!--This section is linked from [[F-space]]-->\n\nThe concept of continuous real-valued functions can be generalized to functions between [[metric space]]s. A metric space is a set ''X'' equipped with a function (called [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]) ''d''<sub>''X''</sub>, that can be thought of as a measurement of the distance of any two elements in ''X''. Formally, the metric is a function\n:<math>d_X \\colon X \\times X \\rightarrow \\mathbf R</math>\nthat satisfies a number of requirements, notably the [[triangle inequality]]. Given two metric spaces (''X'', d<sub>''X''</sub>) and (''Y'', d<sub>''Y''</sub>) and a function\n:<math>f\\colon X \\rightarrow Y</math>\nthen ''f'' is continuous at the point ''c'' in ''X'' (with respect to the given metrics) if for any positive real number \u03b5, there exists a positive real number \u03b4 such that all ''x'' in ''X'' satisfying d<sub>''X''</sub>(''x'', ''c'') < \u03b4 will also satisfy d<sub>''Y''</sub>(''f''(''x''), ''f''(''c'')) < \u03b5. As in the case of real functions above, this is equivalent to the condition that for every sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''X'' with limit lim ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''c'', we have lim ''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) = ''f''(''c''). The latter condition can be weakened as follows: ''f'' is continuous at the point ''c'' if and only if for every convergent sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''X'' with limit ''c'', the sequence (''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)) is a [[Cauchy sequence]], and ''c'' is in the domain of ''f''.\n\nThe set of points at which a function between metric spaces is continuous is a [[G\u03b4 set|G<sub>\u03b4</sub> set]]&nbsp;\u2013 this follows from the \u03b5-\u03b4 definition of continuity.\n\nThis notion of continuity is applied, for example, in [[functional analysis]]. A key statement in this area says that a [[linear operator]]\n:<math>T\\colon V \\rightarrow W</math>\nbetween [[normed vector space]]s ''V'' and ''W'' (which are [[vector spaces]] equipped with a compatible [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], denoted ||''x''||)\nis continuous if and only if it is [[Bounded linear operator|bounded]], that is, there is a constant ''K'' such that\n:<math>\\|T(x)\\| \\leq K \\|x\\|</math>\nfor all ''x'' in ''V''.\n\n===Uniform, H\u00f6lder and Lipschitz continuity===\n[[File:Lipschitz continuity.png|thumb|For a Lipschitz continuous function, there is a double cone (shown in white) whose vertex can be translated along the graph, so that the graph always remains entirely outside the cone.]]\nThe concept of continuity for functions between metric spaces can be strengthened in various ways by limiting the way \u03b4 depends on \u03b5 and ''c'' in the definition above. Intuitively, a function ''f'' as above is [[uniformly continuous]] if the \u03b4 does\nnot depend on the point ''c''. More precisely, it is required that for every [[real number]] ''\u03b5''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 there exists ''\u03b4''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that for every ''c'',&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X'' with ''d''<sub>''X''</sub>(''b'',&nbsp;''c'')&nbsp;<&nbsp;''\u03b4'', we have that ''d''<sub>''Y''</sub>(''f''(''b''),&nbsp;''f''(''c''))&nbsp;<&nbsp;''\u03b5''. Thus, any uniformly continuous function is continuous. The converse does not hold in general, but holds when the domain space ''X'' is [[compact topological space|compact]]. Uniformly continuous maps can be defined in the more general situation of [[uniform space]]s.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Gaal | first1=Steven A. | title=Point set topology | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | location=New York | isbn=978-0-486-47222-5 | year=2009}}, section IV.10</ref>\n\nA function is [[H\u00f6lder continuity|H\u00f6lder continuous]] with exponent \u03b1 (a real number) if there is a constant ''K'' such that for all ''b'' and ''c'' in ''X'', the inequality\n:<math>d_Y (f(b), f(c)) \\leq K \\cdot (d_X (b, c))^\\alpha</math>\nholds.

A topological space is a set ''X'' together with a topology on ''X'', which is a set of [[subset]]s of ''X'' satisfying a few requirements with respect to their unions and intersections that generalize the properties of the [[open ball]]s in metric spaces while still allowing to talk about the [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhoods]] of a given point. The elements of a topology are called [[open subset]]s of ''X'' (with respect to the topology).\n\nA function\n:<math>f\\colon X \\rightarrow Y</math>\nbetween two topological spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' is continuous if for every open set ''V'' \u2286 ''Y'', the [[Image (mathematics)#Inverse image|inverse image]]\n:<math>f^{-1}(V) = \\{x \\in X \\; | \\; f(x) \\in V \\}</math>\nis an open subset of ''X''. That is, ''f'' is a function between the sets ''X'' and ''Y'' (not on the elements of the topology ''T<sub>X</sub>''), but the continuity of ''f'' depends on the topologies used on ''X'' and ''Y''.\n\nThis is equivalent to the condition that the [[Image (mathematics)#Inverse image|preimages]] of the [[closed set]]s (which are the complements of the open subsets) in ''Y'' are closed in ''X''.\n\nAn extreme example: if a set ''X'' is given the [[discrete topology]] (in which every subset is open), all functions\n:<math>f\\colon X \\rightarrow T</math>\nto any topological space ''T'' are continuous. On the other hand, if ''X'' is equipped with the [[indiscrete topology]] (in which the only open subsets are the empty set and ''X'') and the space ''T'' set is at least [[T0 space|T<sub>0</sub>]], then the only continuous functions are the constant functions. Conversely, any function whose range is indiscrete is continuous.\n\n===Continuity at a point===\n[[File:continuity topology.svg|300px|right|frame|Continuity at a point: For every neighborhood ''V'' of ''f''(''x''), there is a neighborhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that ''f''(''U'') \u2286 ''V'']]\nThe translation in the language of neighborhoods of the [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit|(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of continuity]] leads to the following definition of the continuity at a point:\n{{Quote frame|A function <math>f:X\\rightarrow Y</math> is continuous at a point <math>x\\in X</math> if and only if for any neighborhood {{mvar|V}} of <math>f(x)</math> in {{mvar|Y}}, there is a neighborhood {{mvar|U}} of {{mvar|x}} such that {{math|1=''f''(''U'') \u2286 ''V''}}.}}\n\nThis definition is equivalent to the same statement with neighborhoods restricted to open neighborhoods and can be restated in several ways by using [[preimage]]s rather than images.\n\nAlso, as every set that contains a neighborhood is also a neighborhood, and <math>f^{-1}(V)</math> is the largest subset {{mvar|U}} of {{mvar|X}} such that {{math|''f''(''U'') \u2286 ''V''}}, this definition may be simplified into:\n{{Quote frame|A function <math>f:X\\rightarrow Y</math> is continuous at a point <math>x\\in X</math> if and only if <math>f^{-1}(V)</math> is a neighborhood of {{mvar|x}} for every neighborhood {{mvar|V}} of <math>f(x)</math> in {{mvar|Y}}.}}\n\nAs an open set is a set that is a neighborhood of all its points, a function <math>f:X\\rightarrow Y</math> is continuous at every point of {{mvar|''X''}} if and only if it is a continuous function.\n\nIf ''X'' and ''Y'' are metric spaces, it is equivalent to consider the [[neighborhood system]] of [[open ball]]s centered at ''x'' and ''f''(''x'') instead of all neighborhoods. This gives back the above \u03b4-\u03b5 definition of continuity in the context of metric spaces.  In general topological spaces, there is no notion of nearness or distance. If however the target space is a [[Hausdorff space]], it is still true that ''f'' is continuous at ''a'' if and only if the limit of ''f'' as ''x'' approaches ''a'' is ''f''(''a''). At an isolated point, every function is continuous.\n\n===Alternative definitions===\nSeveral [[Characterizations of the category of topological spaces|equivalent definitions for a topological structure]] exist and thus there are several equivalent ways to define a continuous function.\n\n====Sequences and nets {{anchor|Heine definition of continuity}}====\nIn several contexts, the topology of a space is conveniently  specified in terms of [[limit points]].  In many instances, this is accomplished by specifying when a point is the [[limit of a sequence]], but for some spaces that are too large in some sense, one specifies also when a point is the limit of more general sets of points indexed by a [[directed set]], known as [[net (mathematics)|nets]].  A function is (Heine-)continuous only if it takes limits of sequences to limits of sequences.  In the former case, preservation of limits is also sufficient; in the latter, a function may preserve all limits of sequences yet still fail to be continuous, and preservation of nets is a necessary and sufficient condition.\n\nIn detail, a function ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' is '''sequentially continuous''' if whenever a sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''X'' converges to a limit ''x'', the sequence (''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)) converges to ''f''(''x'').  Thus sequentially continuous functions \"preserve sequential limits\".  Every continuous function is sequentially continuous.  If ''X'' is a [[first-countable space]] and [[Axiom of countable choice|countable choice]] holds, then the converse also holds: any function preserving sequential limits is continuous.  In particular, if ''X'' is a metric space, sequential continuity and continuity are equivalent.  For non first-countable spaces, sequential continuity might be strictly weaker than continuity. (The spaces for which the two properties are equivalent are called [[sequential space]]s.) This motivates the consideration of nets instead of sequences in general topological spaces.  Continuous functions preserve limits of nets, and in fact this property characterizes continuous functions.\n\n====Closure operator definition====\nInstead of specifying the open subsets of a topological space, the topology can also be determined by a [[Kuratowski closure operator|closure operator]] (denoted cl) which assigns to any subset ''A'' \u2286 ''X'' its [[closure (topology)|closure]], or an [[interior operator]] (denoted int), which assigns to any subset ''A'' of ''X'' its [[interior (topology)|interior]]. In these terms, a function\n:<math>f\\colon (X,\\mathrm{cl}) \\to (X' ,\\mathrm{cl}')</math>\nbetween topological spaces is continuous in the sense above if and only if for all subsets ''A'' of ''X''\n:<math>f(\\mathrm{cl}(A)) \\subseteq \\mathrm{cl}'(f(A)).</math>\nThat is to say, given any element ''x'' of ''X'' that is in the closure of any subset ''A'', ''f''(''x'') belongs to the closure of ''f''(''A''). This is equivalent to the requirement that for all subsets ''A''<nowiki>'</nowiki> of ''X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>\n:<math>f^{-1}(\\mathrm{cl}'(A')) \\supseteq \\mathrm{cl}(f^{-1}(A')).</math>\nMoreover,\n:<math>f\\colon (X,\\mathrm{int}) \\to (X' ,\\mathrm{int}') </math>\nis continuous if and only if\n:<math>f^{-1}(\\mathrm{int}'(A')) \\subseteq \\mathrm{int}(f^{-1}(A'))</math>\nfor any subset ''A''' of ''Y''.\n\n===Properties===\nIf ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' and ''g'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''Z'' are continuous, then so is the composition ''g'' \u2218 ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Z''. If ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' is continuous and\n* ''X'' is [[Compact space|compact]], then ''f''(''X'') is compact.\n* ''X'' is [[Connected space|connected]], then ''f''(''X'') is connected.\n* ''X'' is [[path-connected]], then ''f''(''X'') is path-connected.\n* ''X'' is [[Lindel\u00f6f space|Lindel\u00f6f]], then ''f''(''X'') is Lindel\u00f6f.\n* ''X'' is [[separable space|separable]], then ''f''(''X'') is separable.\n\nThe possible topologies on a fixed set ''X'' are [[partial ordering|partially ordered]]: a topology \u03c4<sub>1</sub> is said to be [[comparison of topologies|coarser]] than another topology \u03c4<sub>2</sub> (notation: \u03c4<sub>1</sub> \u2286 \u03c4<sub>2</sub>) if every open subset with respect to \u03c4<sub>1</sub> is also open with respect to \u03c4<sub>2</sub>. Then, the [[identity function|identity map]]\n:id<sub>X</sub>: (''X'', \u03c4<sub>2</sub>) \u2192 (''X'', \u03c4<sub>1</sub>)\nis continuous if and only if \u03c4<sub>1</sub> \u2286 \u03c4<sub>2</sub> (see also [[comparison of topologies]]). More generally, a continuous function\n:<math>(X, \\tau_X) \\rightarrow (Y, \\tau_Y)</math>\nstays continuous if the topology \u03c4<sub>''Y''</sub> is replaced by a [[Comparison of topologies|coarser topology]] and/or \u03c4<sub>''X''</sub> is replaced by a [[Comparison of topologies|finer topology]].\n\n===Homeomorphisms===\nSymmetric to the concept of a continuous map is an [[open map]], for which ''images'' of open sets are open. In fact, if an open map ''f'' has an [[inverse function]], that inverse is continuous, and if a continuous map ''g'' has an inverse, that inverse is open. Given a [[bijective]] function ''f'' between two topological spaces, the inverse function ''f''<sup>\u22121</sup> need not be continuous. A bijective continuous function with continuous inverse function is called a ''[[homeomorphism]]''.\n\nIf a continuous bijection has as its [[Domain of a function|domain]] a [[compact space]] and its [[codomain]] is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then it is a homeomorphism.\n\n===Defining topologies via continuous functions===\nGiven a function\n:<math>f\\colon X \\rightarrow S, </math>\nwhere ''X'' is a topological space and ''S'' is a set (without a specified topology), the [[final topology]] on ''S'' is defined by letting the open sets of ''S'' be those subsets ''A'' of ''S'' for which ''f''<sup>\u22121</sup>(''A'') is open in ''X''. If ''S'' has an existing topology, ''f'' is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is [[Comparison of topologies|coarser]] than the final topology on ''S''.  Thus the final topology can be characterized as the finest topology on ''S'' that makes ''f'' continuous.  If ''f'' is [[surjective]], this topology is canonically identified with the [[quotient topology]] under the [[equivalence relation]] defined by ''f''.\n\nDually, for a function ''f'' from a set ''S'' to a topological space ''X'', the [[initial topology]] on ''S'' is defined by designating as an open set every subset ''A'' of ''S'' such that <math>A = f^{-1}(U)</math> for some open subset ''U'' of ''X''.  If ''S'' has an existing topology, ''f'' is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is finer than the initial topology on ''S''.  Thus the initial topology can be characterized as the coarsest topology on ''S'' that makes ''f'' continuous.  If ''f'' is injective, this topology is canonically identified with the [[subspace topology]] of ''S'', viewed as a subset of ''X''.\n\nA topology on a set ''S'' is uniquely determined by the class of all continuous functions <math>S \\rightarrow X</math> into all topological spaces ''X''. [[Duality (mathematics)|Dually]], a similar idea can be applied to maps <math>X \\rightarrow S.</math>\n\n==Related notions==\n\nVarious other mathematical domains use the concept of continuity in different, but related meanings. For example, in [[order theory]], an order-preserving function ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' between particular types of [[partially ordered set]]s ''X'' and ''Y'' is [[Scott continuity|continuous]] if for each directed subset ''A'' of ''X'', we have sup(''f''(''A'')) = ''f''(sup(''A'')). Here sup is the [[supremum]] with respect to the orderings in ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively. This notion of continuity is the same as topological continuity when the partially ordered sets are given the [[Scott topology]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Goubault-Larrecq |first=Jean |title=Non-Hausdorff Topology and Domain Theory: Selected Topics in Point-Set Topology |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2013 |ISBN=1107034132}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Gierz |first1=G. |last2=Hofmann |first2=K.

At every point in the field, the curl of that point is represented by a [[vector (geometry)|vector]]. The attributes of this vector (length and direction) characterize the rotation at that point.\n\nThe direction of the curl is the axis of rotation, as determined by the [[right-hand rule]], and the magnitude of the curl is the magnitude of rotation. If the vector field represents the [[flow velocity]] of a moving [[fluid]], then the curl is the '''[[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] density''' of the fluid. A vector field whose curl is zero is called [[irrotational]]. The curl is a form of [[derivative|differentiation]] for vector fields. The corresponding form of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] is [[Kelvin\u2013Stokes theorem|Stokes' theorem]], which relates the [[surface integral]] of the curl of a vector field to the [[line integral]] of the vector field around the boundary curve.\n\nThe alternative terminology ''rotor'', ''rotation'' or ''rotational'' and alternative notations {{math|'''rot F'''}} and {{math|\u2207 \u00d7 '''F'''}} are often used (the former especially in many European countries, the latter, using the [[del operator|del]] (or [[nabla operator|nabla]]) operator and the [[cross product]], is more used in other countries) for {{math|curl '''F'''}}.

The remaining two components of curl result from [[cyclic permutation]] of [[index notation|indices]]: 3,1,2&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;1,2,3&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;2,3,1.\n\n===Intuitive interpretation===\nSuppose the vector field describes the [[velocity field]] of a [[fluid flow]] (such as a large tank of [[liquid]] or [[gas]]) and a small ball is located within the fluid or gas (the centre of the ball being fixed at a certain point). If the ball has a rough surface, the fluid flowing past it will make it rotate. The rotation axis (oriented according to the right hand rule) points in the direction of the curl of the field at the centre of the ball, and the angular speed of the rotation is half the magnitude of the curl at this point.<ref>{{citation|first1=Josiah Willard |last1=Gibbs|authorlink1=Josiah Willard Gibbs|first2=Edwin Bidwell|last2=Wilson|authorlink2=Edwin Bidwell Wilson|title=Vector analysis|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015000962285?urlappend=%3Bseq=179|year=1901}}</ref>\n\nThe curl of the vector at any point is given  by the rotation of a infinitesimal area in the ''xy''-plane (for ''z''-axis component of the curl), ''zx''-plane (for ''y''-axis component of the curl) and ''yz''-plane (for ''x''-axis component of the curl vector). This can be clearly seen in the examples below.\n\n== Usage ==\nIn practice, the above definition is rarely used because in virtually all cases, the curl [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] can be applied using some set of [[curvilinear coordinates]], for which simpler representations have been derived.\n\nThe notation {{math|\u2207 \u00d7 '''F'''}} has its origins in the similarities to the 3-dimensional [[cross product]], and it is useful as a [[mnemonic]] in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] if {{math|\u2207}} is taken as a vector [[differential operator]] [[del]]. Such notation involving [[operator (physics)|operators]] is common in [[physics]] and [[algebra]].\n\nExpanded in 3-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] (see ''[[Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates]]'' for [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]] and [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical]] coordinate representations), {{math|\u2207 \u00d7 '''F'''}} is, for {{math|'''F'''}} composed of {{math|[''F<sub>x</sub>'', ''F<sub>y</sub>'', ''F<sub>z</sub>'']}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\[5pt]\n{\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}} & {\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}} & {\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial z}} \\\\[10pt]\nF_x & F_y & F_z \\end{vmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''i'''}}, {{math|'''j'''}}, and {{math|'''k'''}} are the [[unit vector]]s for the {{math|''x''}}-, {{math|''y''}}-, and {{math|''z''}}-axes, respectively. This expands as follows:<ref>Arfken, p. 43.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z}\\right) \\mathbf{i} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x} \\right) \\mathbf{j} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y} \\right) \\mathbf{k} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y}\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nAlthough expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under proper rotations of the coordinate axes but the result inverts under reflection.\n\nIn a general coordinate system, the curl is given by<ref name=\"Mathworld\">{{MathWorld |title=Curl |urlname=Curl}}</ref>\n\n:<math>(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} )^k = \\varepsilon^{k\\ell m} \\nabla_\\ell F_m</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03b5}} denotes the [[Levi-Civita symbol#Levi-Civita tensors|Levi-Civita tensor]] and {{math|\u2207}} the [[covariant derivative]], the [[metric tensor]] is used to [[raising and lowering indices|lower the index]] on {{math|'''F'''}}, and the [[Einstein summation convention]] implies that repeated indices are summed over. Equivalently,\n\n:<math>(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} ) = \\mathbf{e}_k\\varepsilon^{k\\ell m} \\nabla_l F_m</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''e'''<sub>''k''</sub>}} are the coordinate vector fields. Equivalently, using the [[exterior derivative]], the curl can be expressed as:\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\left( \\star \\big( {\\mathrm d} F^\\flat \\big) \\right)^\\sharp </math>\n\nHere {{music|flat}} and {{music|sharp}} are the [[musical isomorphism]]s, and {{math|<small>\u2605</small>}} is the [[Hodge star operator]]. This formula shows how to calculate the curl of {{math|'''F'''}} in any coordinate system, and how to extend the curl to any [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] three-dimensional [[Riemannian metric|Riemannian]] manifold. Since this depends on a choice of orientation, curl is a [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] operation. In other words, if the orientation is reversed, then the direction of the curl is also reversed.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Example 1===\nTake the [[vector field]]:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)=y\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}}-x\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}.</math>\n\nIts corresponding plot:\n\n[[Image:Uniform curl.svg|center|250px]]\n\nUpon visual inspection, the field can be described as \"rotating\". If a stationary object were to be placed in the field with the vectors representing a linear [[force]], the object would rotate clockwise.\n\nCalculating the curl:\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} =0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}}+0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}+ \\left({\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}(-x) -{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}} y\\right)\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}=-2\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}\n</math>\n\nThe resulting vector field describing the curl would be uniformly going in the negative {{Math|''z''}} direction. It should be noted that the results of this equation align with what could have been predicted using the [[right-hand rule]] using a [[Cartesian coordinate system#In three dimensions|right-handed coordinate system]]. Being a uniform vector field, the object described before would have the same rotational intensity regardless of where it was placed.\n\nThe plot describing the curl of {{math|'''F'''}}:\n\n[[Image:Curl of uniform curl.png|center|250px]]\n\n===Example 2===\nTake the vector field:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)=-x^2\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}.</math>\n\nIts corresponding plot:\n\n[[Image:Nonuniform curl.svg|250px|center]]\n\nUpon initial inspection, curl existing in this graph would not be obvious. However, taking the object in the previous example, and placing it anywhere on the line {{Math|''x'' {{=}} 3}}, the force exerted on the right side would be slightly greater than the force exerted on the left, causing it to rotate clockwise. Using the right-hand rule, it can be predicted that the resulting curl would be straight in the negative {{Math|''z''}} direction. Inversely, if placed on {{Math|''x'' {{=}} \u22123}}, the object would rotate counterclockwise and the right-hand rule would result in a positive {{Math|''z''}} direction.\n\nCalculating the curl:\n\n:<math>{\\nabla} \\times \\mathbf{F} =0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}}+0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}+ {\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}(-x^2) \\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}=-2x\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}.\n</math>\n\nAs predicted, the curl points in the negative {{Math|''z''}} direction when {{Math|''x''}} is positive and vice versa. In this field, the intensity of rotation would be greater as the object moves away from the plane {{Math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nThe plot describing the curl of {{math|'''F'''}}:\n\n[[Image:Curl of nonuniform curl.png|center|250px]]\n\n===Identities===\n{{Main article|Vector calculus identities}}\nIn general [[curvilinear coordinates]] (not only in Cartesian coordinates), the curl of a cross product of vector fields {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''F'''}} can be shown to be\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\left( \\mathbf{v \\times F} \\right) = \\Big( \\left( \\mathbf{ \\nabla \\cdot F } \\right) + \\mathbf{F \\cdot \\nabla} \\Big) \\mathbf{v}- \\Big( \\left( \\mathbf{ \\nabla \\cdot v } \\right) + \\mathbf{v \\cdot \\nabla} \\Big) \\mathbf{F} \\ . </math>\n\nInterchanging the vector field {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|\u2207}} operator, we arrive at the cross product of a vector field with curl of a vector field:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{v \\ \\times } \\left( \\mathbf{ \\nabla \\times F} \\right) =\\nabla_\\mathbf{F} \\left( \\mathbf{v \\cdot F } \\right) - \\left( \\mathbf{v \\cdot \\nabla } \\right) \\mathbf{ F} \\ , </math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u2207<sub>'''F'''</sub>}} is the Feynman subscript notation, which considers only the variation due to the vector field {{math|'''F'''}} (i.e., in this case, {{math|'''v'''}} is treated as being constant in space).\n\nAnother example is the curl of a curl of a vector field. It can be shown that in general coordinates\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\times \\left( \\mathbf{\\nabla \\times F} \\right) = \\mathbf{\\nabla} (\\mathbf{\\nabla \\cdot F}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{F} \\ , </math>\n\nand this identity defines the [[vector Laplacian]] of {{math|'''F'''}}, symbolized as {{math|\u2207<sup>2</sup>'''F'''}}.\n\nThe curl of the [[gradient]] of ''any'' [[scalar field]] {{mvar|\u03c6}} is always the [[zero vector]] field\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times ( \\nabla \\varphi ) = \\boldsymbol{0}</math>\n\nwhich follows from the [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetry]] in the definition of the curl, and the [[symmetry of second derivatives]].\n\nIf {{mvar|\u03c6}} is a scalar valued function and {{math|'''F'''}} is a vector field, then\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times ( \\varphi \\mathbf{F}) = \\nabla \\varphi \\times \\mathbf{F} + \\varphi \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} </math>\n\n===Descriptive examples===\n* In a vector field describing the linear velocities of each part of a rotating disk, the curl has the same value at all points.\n* Of the four [[Maxwell's equations]], two\u2014[[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] and [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|Amp\u00e8re's law]]\u2014can be compactly expressed using curl. Faraday's law states that the curl of an electric field is equal to the opposite of the time rate of change of the magnetic field, while Amp\u00e8re's law relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current and rate of change of the electric field.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nThe vector calculus operations of [[gradient|grad]], curl, and [[divergence|div]] are most easily generalized and understood in the context of differential forms, which involves a number of steps. In a nutshell, they correspond to the derivatives of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively. The geometric interpretation of curl as rotation corresponds to identifying [[bivector]]s (2-vectors) in 3 dimensions with the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] {{math|<math>\\mathfrak{so}</math>(3)}} of infinitesimal rotations (in coordinates, skew-symmetric 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3 matrices), while representing rotations by vectors corresponds to identifying 1-vectors (equivalently, 2-vectors) and {{math|<math>\\mathfrak{so}</math>(3)}}, these all being 3-dimensional spaces.\n\n=== Differential forms ===\n{{main article|Differential form}}\nIn 3 dimensions, a differential 0-form is simply a function {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}; a differential 1-form is the following expression:\n:<math>a_1\\,dx + a_2\\,dy + a_3\\,dz;</math>\na differential 2-form is the formal sum:\n:<math>a_{12}\\,dx\\wedge dy + a_{13}\\,dx\\wedge dz + a_{23}\\,dy\\wedge dz;</math>\nand a differential 3-form is defined by a single term:\n:<math>a_{123}\\,dx\\wedge dy\\wedge dz.</math>\n(Here the {{mvar|a}}-coefficients are real functions; the \"wedge products\", e.g. {{math|''dx'' \u2227 ''dy''}}, can be interpreted as some kind of oriented area elements, {{math|''dx'' \u2227 ''dy'' {{=}} \u2212''dy'' \u2227 ''dx''}}, etc.)\n\nThe [[exterior derivative]] of a {{math|''k''}}-form in {{math|\u211d<sup>3</sup>}} is defined as the {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-form from above\u2014and in {{math|\u211d<sup>''n''</sup>}} if, e.g.,\n\n:<math>\\omega^{(k)}=\\sum_{\\scriptstyle{i_1<i_2<\\cdots<i_k} \\atop \\forall \\scriptstyle{i_\\nu\\in 1,\\ldots,n}} a_{i_1,\\ldots,i_k}\\,dx_{i_1}\\wedge \\cdots\\wedge dx_{i_k},</math>\n\nthen the exterior derivative {{math|''d''}} leads to\n\n:<math> d\\omega^{(k)}=\\sum_{\\scriptstyle{j=1} \\atop \\scriptstyle{i_1<\\cdots<i_k}}^n\\frac{\\partial a_{i_1,\\ldots,i_k}}{\\partial x_j}\\,dx_j \\wedge dx_{i_1}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_{i_k}.</math>\n\nThe exterior derivative of a 1-form is therefore a 2-form, and that of a 2-form is a 3-form. On the other hand, because of the interchangeability of mixed derivatives, e.g. because of\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\,\\partial y}=\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y\\,\\partial x},</math>\n\nthe twofold application of the exterior derivative leads to 0.\n\nThus, denoting the space of {{math|''k''}}-forms by {{math|\u03a9<sup>''k''</sup>(\u211d<sup>3</sup>)}} and the exterior derivative by {{math|''d''}} one gets a sequence:\n\n:<math>0 \\, \\overset{d}{\\longrightarrow} \\, \\Omega^0(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\longrightarrow} \\, \\Omega^1(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\longrightarrow} \\, \\Omega^2(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\longrightarrow} \\, \\Omega^3(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\longrightarrow} \\, 0.</math>\n\nHere {{math|\u03a9<sup>''k''</sup>(\u211d<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is the space of sections of the [[exterior algebra]] {{math|\u039b<sup>''k''</sup>(\u211d<sup>''n''</sup>)}} [[vector bundle]] over \u211d<sup>''n''</sup>, whose dimension is the [[binomial coefficient]] {{math|<big><big>(</big></big>{{su|p=''n''|b=''k''}}<big><big>)</big></big>}}; note that {{math|\u03a9<sup>''k''</sup>(\u211d<sup>3</sup>) {{=}} 0}} for {{math|''k'' > 3}} or {{math|''k'' < 0}}. Writing only dimensions, one obtains a row of [[Pascal's triangle]]:\n\n:0 \u2192 1 \u2192 3 \u2192 3 \u2192 1 \u2192 0;\n\nthe 1-dimensional fibers correspond to functions, and the 3-dimensional fibers to vector fields, as described below. Modulo suitable identifications, the three nontrivial occurrences of the exterior derivative correspond to grad, curl, and div.\n\nDifferential forms and the differential can be defined on any Euclidean space, or indeed any manifold, without any notion of a Riemannian metric. On a [[Riemannian manifold]], or more generally [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], {{math|''k''}}-forms can be identified with [[p-vector|{{math|''k''}}-vector]] fields ({{math|''k''}}-forms are {{math|''k''}}-covector fields, and a pseudo-Riemannian metric gives an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), and on an ''oriented'' vector space with a [[nondegenerate form]] (an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), there is an isomorphism between {{math|''k''}}-vectors and {{math|(''n'' \u2212 ''k'')}}-vectors; in particular on (the tangent space of) an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Thus on an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold, one can interchange {{math|''k''}}-forms, {{math|''k''}}-vector fields, {{math|(''n'' \u2212 ''k'')}}-forms, and {{math|(''n'' \u2212 ''k'')}}-vector fields; this is known as [[Hodge duality]]. Concretely, on {{math|\u211d<sup>3</sup>}} this is given by:\n* 1-forms and 1-vector fields: the 1-form {{math|''a<sub>x</sub> dx'' + ''a<sub>y</sub> dy'' + ''a<sub>z</sub> dz''}} corresponds to the vector field {{math|(''a<sub>x</sub>'', ''a<sub>y</sub>'', ''a<sub>z</sub>'')}}.\n* 1-forms and 2-forms: one replaces {{math|''dx''}} by the dual quantity {{math|''dy'' \u2227 ''dz''}} (i.e., omit {{math|''dx''}}), and likewise, taking care of orientation: {{math|''dy''}} corresponds to {{math|''dz'' \u2227 ''dx'' {{=}} \u2212''dx'' \u2227 ''dz''}}, and {{math|''dz''}} corresponds to {{math|''dx'' \u2227 ''dy''}}. Thus the form {{math|''a<sub>x</sub> dx'' + ''a<sub>y</sub> dy'' + ''a<sub>z</sub> dz''}} corresponds to the \"dual form\" {{math|''a<sub>z</sub> dx'' \u2227 ''dy'' + ''a<sub>y</sub> dz'' \u2227 ''dx'' + ''a<sub>x</sub> dy'' \u2227 ''dz''}}.\n\nThus, identifying 0-forms and 3-forms with functions, and 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields:\n* grad takes a function (0-form) to a vector field (1-form);\n* curl takes a vector field (1-form) to a vector field (2-form);\n* div takes a vector field (2-form) to a function (3-form)\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that {{math|''d''{{isup|2}} {{=}} 0}} corresponds to the identities\n:<math>\\nabla\\times(\\nabla f) = 0</math>\nfor any function {{mvar|f}}, and\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times\\mathbf v)=0</math>\nfor any vector field {{math|'''v'''}}.\n\nGrad and div generalize to all oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, with the same geometric interpretation, because the spaces of 0-forms and {{math|''n''}}-forms is always (fiberwise) 1-dimensional and can be identified with scalar functions, while the spaces of 1-forms and {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-forms are always fiberwise {{math|''n''}}-dimensional and can be identified with vector fields.\n\nCurl does not generalize in this way to 4 or more dimensions (or down to 2 or fewer dimensions); in 4 dimensions the dimensions are\n\n:0 \u2192 1 \u2192 4 \u2192 6 \u2192 4 \u2192 1 \u2192 0;\n\nso the curl of a 1-vector field (fiberwise 4-dimensional) is a ''2-vector field'', which is fiberwise 6-dimensional, one has\n\n:<math>\\omega^{(2)}=\\sum_{i<k=1,2,3,4}a_{i,k}\\,dx_i\\wedge dx_k,</math>\n\nwhich yields a sum of six independent terms, and cannot be identified with a 1-vector field. Nor can one meaningfully go from a 1-vector field to a 2-vector field to a 3-vector field (4 \u2192 6 \u2192 4), as taking the differential twice yields zero ({{math|''d''{{isup|2}} {{=}} 0}}). Thus there is no curl function from vector fields to vector fields in other dimensions arising in this way.\n\nHowever, one can define a curl of a vector field as a ''2-vector field'' in general, as described below.\n\n=== Curl geometrically ===\n2-vectors correspond to the exterior power {{math|\u039b<sup>2</sup>''V''}}; in the presence of an inner product, in coordinates these are the skew-symmetric matrices, which are geometrically considered as the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] {{math|<math>\\mathfrak{so}</math>(''V'')}} of infinitesimal rotations. This has {{math|<big><big>(</big></big>{{su|p=''n''|b=2}}<big><big>)</big></big> {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}''n''(''n'' \u2212 1)}} dimensions, and allows one to interpret the differential of a 1-vector field as its infinitesimal rotations. Only in 3 dimensions (or trivially in 0 dimensions) does {{math|''n'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}''n''(''n'' \u2212 1)}}, which is the most elegant and common case. In 2 dimensions the curl of a vector field is not a vector field but a function, as 2-dimensional rotations are given by an angle (a scalar \u2013 an orientation is required to choose whether one counts clockwise or counterclockwise rotations as positive); this is not the div, but is rather perpendicular to it. In 3 dimensions the curl of a vector field is a vector field as is familiar (in 1 and 0 dimensions the curl of a vector field is 0, because there are no non-trivial 2-vectors), while in 4 dimensions the curl of a vector field is, geometrically, at each point an element of the 6-dimensional Lie algebra {{math|<math>\\mathfrak{so}</math>(4)}}.\n\nNote also that the curl of a 3-dimensional vector field which only depends on 2 coordinates (say {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}) is simply a vertical vector field (in the {{math|''z''}} direction) whose magnitude is the curl of the 2-dimensional vector field, as in the examples on this page.\n\nConsidering curl as a 2-vector field (an antisymmetric 2-tensor) has been used to generalize vector calculus and associated physics to higher dimensions.<ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0609260 Generalizing Cross Products and Maxwell's Equations to Universal Extra Dimensions], A.W.

A full proof of necessity was given by [[Pierre Wantzel]]. See the [[Constructible polygon]] article for further discussion.</ref> This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of [[philology]] as a career.\nGauss was so pleased with this result that he requested that a regular [[heptadecagon]] be inscribed on his tombstone. The [[stone masonry|stonemason]] declined, stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like a circle.<ref>Pappas, Theoni, ''Mathematical Snippets'', 2008, p. 42.</ref>\n\nThe year 1796 was most productive for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a construction of the heptadecagon on 30 March.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Carl Friedrich Gauss \u00a7\u00a7365\u2013366 in ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]''. Leipzig, Germany, 1801. New Haven, CT: [[Yale University Press]], 1965.</ref> He further advanced [[modular arithmetic]], greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory. On 8 April he became the first to prove the [[quadratic reciprocity]] law. This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic. The [[prime number theorem]], conjectured on 31 May, gives a good understanding of how the [[prime number]]s are distributed among the integers.\n\nGauss also discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three [[triangular number]]s on 10 July and then jotted down in [[Gauss's diary|his diary]] the note: \"[[Eureka (word)|\u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u0397\u039a\u0391]]! {{nowrap|num {{=}} \u0394 + \u0394' + \u0394\"}}. On 1 October he published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in [[finite field]]s, which 150 years later led to the [[Weil conjectures]].\n\n=== Later years and death ===\n[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss on his Deathbed, 1855.jpg|thumb|Gauss on his deathbed (1855)]]\n[[File:Grave of Carl Friedrich Gau\u00df at Albani-Friedhof G\u00f6ttingen 2017 02.jpg|thumb|Gauss's gravesite at [[Albanifriedhof|Albani Cemetery]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], Germany]]\nGauss remained mentally active into his old age, even while suffering from [[gout]] and general unhappiness.<ref name=\":4\" /> For example, at the age of 62, he taught himself Russian.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn 1840, Gauss published his influential ''Dioptrische Untersuchungen'',<ref name=\"B\u00fchler1\">{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=B\u00fchler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=0-387-10662-6|ref=harv|pages=144\u2013145}}</ref> in which he gave the first systematic analysis on the formation of images under a [[paraxial approximation]] ([[Gaussian optics]]).<ref name=Hecht>{{Cite book|title=Optics|first=Eugene|last=Hecht|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1987|isbn=0-201-11609-X|ref=harv|page=134}}</ref> Among his results, Gauss showed that under a paraxial approximation an optical system can be characterized by its [[Cardinal point (optics)|cardinal points]]<ref name=Bass>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Optics| first1=Michael|last1=Bass|first2=Casimer|last2=DeCusatis| first3=Jay|last3=Enoch|first4=Vasudevan|last4=Lakshminarayanan|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|year=2009|isbn=0-07-149889-3|ref=harv|page=17.7}}</ref> and he derived the Gaussian lens formula.<ref name=Ostdiek>{{Cite book|title=Inquiry into Physics |first1=Vern J. |last1=Ostdiek|first2=Donald J.|last2=Bord|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=0-495-11943-1|ref=harv|page=381}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, he became an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands; when that became the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1851, he joined as a foreign member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00000342 |title=C.F.

''Carl Friedrich Gauss, Titan of Science: A Study of His Life and Work''.

Waldo Dunnington]], described Gauss's religious views as follows:\n<blockquote>For him science was the means of exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full strength, it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward the end of his life, it brought him confidence. Gauss's God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report the truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.<ref>Guy Waldo Dunnington (1955). ''Carl Friedrich Gauss, Titan of Science: A Study of His Life and Work''. Exposition Press, pp. 298\u2013301</ref></blockquote>\n\nApart from his correspondence, there are not many known details about Gauss's personal creed. Many biographers of Gauss disagree about his religious stance, with B\u00fchler and others considering him a [[deism|deist]] with very unorthodox views,<ref name=Buhler3/><ref name=\"Gerhard Falk 1995 121\">{{cite book|title=American Judaism in Transition: The Secularization of a Religious Community|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-0016-3|author=Gerhard Falk|page=121|quote=Gauss told his friend Rudolf Wagner, a professor of biology at Gottingen University, that he did not fully believe in the Bible but that he had meditated a great deal on the future of the human soul and speculated on the possibility of the soul being reincarnated on another planet.

He did not believe literally in all Christian dogmas. Officially he was a member of St. Albans Church (Evangelical Lutheran) in Gottingen. All baptisms, burials, and weddings in his family occurred there. It is also not known whether he attended church regularly or contributed financially. A faculty colleague called Gauss a deist, but there is good reason to believe that this label did not fit well. Gauss possessed strong religious tolerance which he carried over to every belief originating in the depths of the human heart. This tolerance is not to be confused with religious indifference. He took a special interest in the religious development of the human race, especially in his own century. With reference to the manifold denominations, which frequently did not agree with his views, he always emphasized that one is not justified in disturbing the faith of others in which they find consolation for earthly sufferings and a safe refuge in days of misfortune\"}}</ref>\n\nIn connection to this, there is a record of a conversation between [[Rudolf Wagner]] and Gauss, in which they discussed [[William Whewell]]'s book ''Of the Plurality of Worlds''. In this work, Whewell had discarded the possibility of existing life in other planets, on the basis of theological arguments, but this was a position with which both Wagner and Gauss disagreed. Later Wagner explained that he did not fully believe in the Bible, though he confessed that he \"envied\" those who were able to easily believe.<ref name=Buhler3>{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=B\u00fchler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=0-387-10662-6|ref=harv|page=153}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Carl Friedrich Gauss: Titan of Science|year=2004|publisher=MAA|isbn=9780883855478|page=305|author=Guy Waldo Dunnington|quote=\"league, I believe you are more believing in the Bible than I.

He did not want any of his sons to enter mathematics or science for \"fear of lowering the family name\", as he believed none of them would surpass his own achievements.<ref name=\"gausschildren\" /> Gauss wanted Eugene to become a lawyer, but Eugene wanted to study languages. They had an argument over a party Eugene held, which Gauss refused to pay for. The son left in anger and, in about 1832, emigrated to the United States, where he was quite successful. While working for the American Fur Company in the Midwest, he learned the Sioux language. Later, he moved to [[Missouri]] and became a successful businessman. Wilhelm also moved to America in 1837 and settled in Missouri, starting as a farmer and later becoming wealthy in the shoe business in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. It took many years for Eugene's success to counteract his reputation among Gauss's friends and colleagues. See also [[s:Robert Gauss to Felix Klein - September 3, 1912|the letter from Robert Gauss to Felix Klein]] on 3 September 1912.\n\n=== Personality ===\nCarl Gauss was an ardent [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]] and a hard worker. He was never a prolific writer, refusing to publish work which he did not consider complete and above criticism. This was in keeping with his personal motto ''pauca sed matura'' (\"few, but ripe\"). His personal diaries indicate that he had made several important mathematical discoveries years or decades before his contemporaries published them. Scottish-American mathematician and writer [[Eric Temple Bell]] said that if Gauss had published all of his discoveries in a timely manner, he would have advanced mathematics by fifty years.<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Bell |first=E.

It is said that he attended only a single scientific conference, which was in [[Berlin]] in 1828. However, several of his students became influential mathematicians, among them [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]].\n\nOn Gauss's recommendation, [[Friedrich Bessel]] was awarded an honorary doctor degree from G\u00f6ttingen in March 1811.<ref>Bessel never had a university education.</ref> Around that time, the two men engaged in an epistolary correspondence.<ref>Helmut Koch, ''Introduction to Classical Mathematics I: From the Quadratic Reciprocity Law to the Uniformization Theorem'', Springer, p. 90.</ref> However, when they met in person in 1825, they quarrelled; the details are unknown.<ref>Oscar Sheynin, [http://sheynin.de/download/hist_stat.pdf ''History of Statistics''], Berlin: NG Verlag Berlin, 2012, p. 88.</ref>\n\nBefore she died, [[Sophie Germain]] was recommended by Gauss to receive her honorary degree; she never received it.<ref>Mackinnon, Nick (1990). \"Sophie Germain, or, Was Gauss a feminist?\". ''The Mathematical Gazette'' '''74''' (470): 346\u2013351, esp. p. 347.</ref>\n\nGauss usually declined to present the intuition behind his often very elegant proofs\u2014he preferred them to appear \"out of thin air\" and erased all traces of how he discovered them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} This is justified, if unsatisfactorily, by Gauss in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'', where he states that all analysis (i.e., the paths one traveled to reach the solution of a problem) must be suppressed for sake of brevity.\n\nGauss supported the monarchy and opposed [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], whom he saw as an outgrowth of revolution.\n\nGauss summarized his views on the pursuit of knowledge in a letter to [[Farkas Bolyai]] dated 2 September 1808 as follows:<blockquote>It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again. The never-satisfied man is so strange; if he has completed a structure, then it is not in order to dwell in it peacefully, but in order to begin another. I imagine the world conqueror must feel thus, who, after one kingdom is scarcely conquered, stretches out his arms for others.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Carl Friedrich Gauss: Titan of Science|last=Dunnington|first=G. Waldo|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=416}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Career and achievements ==\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Algebra===\n[[File:Disqvisitiones-800.jpg|thumb|Title page of Gauss's magnum opus, ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'']]\nIn his 1799 doctorate in absentia, ''A new proof of the theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of the first or second degree'', Gauss proved the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] which states that every non-constant single-variable [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has at least one complex [[root of a function|root]]. Mathematicians including [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to the implicit use of the [[Jordan curve theorem]]. However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.\n\nGauss also made important contributions to [[number theory]] with his 1801 book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' ([[Latin]], Arithmetical Investigations), which, among other things, introduced the symbol {{math|\u2261}} for [[Congruence relation|congruence]] and used it in a clean presentation of [[modular arithmetic]], contained the first two proofs of the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]], developed the theories of binary and ternary [[quadratic form]]s, stated the [[class number problem]] for them, and showed that a regular [[heptadecagon]] (17-sided polygon) can be [[Compass and straightedge constructions|constructed with straightedge and compass]]. It appears that Gauss already knew the [[class number formula]] in 1801.<ref>http://mathoverflow.net/questions/109330/did-gauss-know-dirichlets-class-number-formula-in-1801</ref>\n\nIn addition, he proved the following conjectured theorems:\n* [[Fermat polygonal number theorem]] for ''n'' = 3\n* [[Fermat's last theorem]] for ''n'' = 5\n* [[Descartes's rule of signs]]\n* [[Kepler conjecture]] for regular arrangements\n\nHe also\n* explained the pentagramma mirificum (see [https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~sek/cluster/pentagramma/ University of Bielefeld website])\n* developed an algorithm for determining the [[Computus#Gauss algorithm|date of Easter]]\n* invented the [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm]] for calculating the [[discrete Fourier transform]]s 160 years before Cooley and Tukey\n\n===Astronomy===\n[[File:Bendixen - Carl Friedrich Gau\u00df, 1828.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Gauss published in ''[[Astronomische Nachrichten]]'' (1828)]]\nIn the same year, Italian astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovered the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat more than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data\u2014three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit. Gauss heard about the problem and tackled it. After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801\u2014just about a year after its first sighting\u2014and this turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when it was rediscovered by [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] on 31 December at [[Gotha Observatory|Gotha]], and one day later by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] in [[Bremen]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Gauss's method]] involved determining a [[conic section]] in space, given one focus (the Sun) and the conic's intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Second Law]]). This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work, Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose.<ref>{{cite book|title=Development of mathematics in the 19th century|last1=Klein|first1=Felix|last2=Hermann|first2=Robert |isbn=978-0-915692-28-6|year=1979|publisher=Math Sci Press}}</ref>\n\nOne such method was the [[fast Fourier transform]]. While this method is traditionally attributed to a 1965 paper by [[J. W. Cooley]] and [[J. W. Tukey]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cooley |first=James W. |first2=John W. |last2=Tukey |title=An algorithm for the machine calculation of complex Fourier series |journal=[[Mathematics of Computation|Math.

Though Gauss had up to that point been financially supported by his stipend from the Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support. Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical [[G\u00f6ttingen Observatory|observatory in G\u00f6ttingen]], a post he held for the remainder of his life.\n\n[[File:Normal Distribution PDF.svg|thumb|Four [[Gaussian distributions]]]]\nThe discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as ''Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum'' (Theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun). In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th-century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation.<ref>Felix Klein, Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Entwicklung der Mathematik im 19. Jahrhundert. Berlin: Julius Springer Verlag, 1926. </ref> It introduced the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]], and contained an influential treatment of the [[Least squares|method of least squares]], a procedure used in all sciences to this day to minimize the impact of [[Observational error|measurement error]].\n\nGauss proved the method under the assumption of [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] errors (see [[Gauss\u2013Markov theorem]]; see also [[List of topics named after Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gaussian]]). The method had been described earlier by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in 1805, but Gauss claimed that he had been using it since 1794 or 1795.<ref>Oscar Sheynin, [http://sheynin.de/download/hist_stat.pdf ''History of Statistics''], Berlin: NG Verlag Berlin, 2012, p. 81.</ref> In the history of statistics, this disagreement is called the \"priority dispute over the discovery of the method of least squares.\"<ref>Stephen M. Stigler, \"Gauss and the Invention of Least Squares,\" ''Ann. Statist.'', '''9'''(3), 1981, pp. 465\u2013474.</ref>\n\n=== Geodetic survey ===\n[[File:Gau\u00df-Stein Garlste.jpg|thumb|[[Surveying|Geodetic survey]] stone in Garlste (now [[Garstedt|Garlstedt]])]]\nIn 1818 Gauss, putting his calculation skills to practical use, carried out a [[surveying|geodetic survey]] of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], linking up with previous Danish surveys. To aid the survey, Gauss invented the [[heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances, to measure positions.\n\n===Non-Euclidean geometries===\nGauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] but never published it. This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory.\n\nResearch on these geometries led to, among other things, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean. His friend [[Farkas Bolyai|Farkas Wolfgang Bolyai]] with whom Gauss had sworn \"brotherhood and the banner of truth\" as a student, had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry.\n\nBolyai's son, [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai]], discovered non-Euclidean geometry in 1829; his work was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: \"To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work&nbsp;... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years.\"\n\nThis unproved statement put a strain on his relationship with Bolyai who thought that Gauss was \"stealing\" his idea.<ref name=\"Krantz2010\">{{cite book|author=Steven G. Krantz|title=An Episodic History of Mathematics: Mathematical Culture through Problem Solving|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulmAH-6IzNoC&pg=PA171|accessdate=9 February 2013|date=1 April 2010|publisher=MAA|isbn=978-0-88385-766-3|pages=171\u2013}}</ref>\n\nLetters from Gauss years before 1829 reveal him obscurely discussing the problem of parallel lines. [[G.

The Door to Science by keplersdiscovery.com.</ref> fueled Gauss's interest in [[differential geometry]] and [[topology]], fields of mathematics dealing with [[curve]]s and [[Surface (topology)|surfaces]]. Among other things, he came up with the notion of [[Gaussian curvature]].\nThis led in 1828 to an important theorem, the [[Theorema Egregium]] (''remarkable theorem''), establishing an important property of the notion of [[curvature]]. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring [[angle]]s and [[distance]]s on the surface.\n\nThat is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be [[embedding|embedded]] in 3-dimensional space or 2-dimensional space.\n\nIn 1821, he was made a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

They constructed the first [[Electrical telegraph|electromechanical telegraph]] in 1833,<ref name=\":4\" /> which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in G\u00f6ttingen. Gauss ordered a magnetic [[observatory]] to be built in the garden of the observatory, and with Weber founded the \"Magnetischer Verein\" (''magnetic association''), which supported measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world. He developed a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which was in use well into the second half of the 20th century, and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer ([[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]]) sources of Earth's magnetic field.\n\n==Appraisal==\nThe British mathematician [[Henry John Stephen Smith]] (1826\u20131883) gave the following appraisal of Gauss:\n{{block quote|If we except the great name of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] it is probable that no mathematicians of any age or country have ever surpassed Gauss in the combination of an abundant fertility of invention with an absolute rigorousness in demonstration, which the ancient Greeks themselves might have envied. It may seem paradoxical, but it is probably nevertheless true that it is precisely the efforts after logical perfection of form which has rendered the writings of Gauss open to the charge of obscurity and unnecessary difficulty. Gauss says more than once that, for brevity, he gives only the synthesis, and suppresses the analysis of his propositions. If, on the other hand, we turn to a memoir of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]'s, there is a sort of free and luxuriant gracefulness about the whole performance, which tells of the quiet pleasure which Euler must have taken in each step of his work. It is not the least of Gauss's claims to the admiration of mathematicians, that, while fully penetrated with a sense of the vastness of the science, he exacted the utmost rigorousness in every part of it, never passed over a difficulty, as if it did not exist, and never accepted a theorem as true beyond the limits within which it could actually be demonstrated.<ref>H.J.S Smith,''Presidential Address'', Proceedings of the London Math. Soc. VIII, 18.</ref>}}\n\n== Anecdotes ==\nThere are several stories of his early genius. According to one, his gifts became very apparent at the age of three when he corrected, mentally and without fault in his calculations, an error his father had made on paper while calculating finances.\n\nAnother story has it that in primary school after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. B\u00fcttner, gave him a task: add a list of [[integer]]s in [[arithmetic progression]]; as the story is most often told, these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant [[Johann Christian Martin Bartels|Martin Bartels]].\n\nGauss's presumed method was to realize that pairwise addition of terms from opposite ends of the list yielded identical intermediate sums: 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;100&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;99&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;98&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, and so on, for a [[Triangular number|total sum]] of 50&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;101&nbsp;=&nbsp;5050.\nHowever, the details of the story are at best uncertain (see<ref name=\"hayesreckoning\" /> for discussion of the original [[Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen]] source and the changes in other versions); some authors, such as Joseph Rotman in his book ''A first course in Abstract Algebra'', question whether it ever happened.\n\nAccording to [[Isaac Asimov]], Gauss was once interrupted in the middle of a problem and told that his wife was dying. He is purported to have said, \"Tell her to wait a moment till I'm done.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Asimov |first=I.\n |title=Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology; the Lives and Achievements of 1195 Great Scientists from Ancient Times to the Present, Chronologically Arranged.\n |location=New York\n |publisher=Doubleday\n |year=1972\n |isbn=978-0385177719}}</ref> This anecdote is briefly discussed in [[G.

As a result of [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|westward Anglo-Saxon expansion]], the Britons of the southwest were separated from those in modern-day [[Wales]] and [[Cumbria]]. Some scholars have proposed that this split took place after the [[Battle of Deorham]] in about 577. The western dialects eventually evolved into [[Welsh language|modern Welsh]] and the now extinct [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], while [[Southwestern Brittonic languages|Southwestern Brittonic]] developed into Cornish and Breton, the latter as a result of emigration to parts of the continent, known as [[Brittany]] over the following centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Kenneth |title=Language and History in Early Britain |location=Edinburgh| publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=1953 }}</ref>\n\n=== Old Cornish ===\nThe area controlled by the southwestern Britons was progressively reduced by the expansion of [[Wessex]] over the next few centuries. During the Old Cornish period (800\u20131200), the Cornish-speaking area was largely coterminous with modern-day [[Cornwall]]; the region of [[Devon]] was isolated by Wessex in 936 AD and many inhabitants fled to Cornwall or [[Brittany]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ball|first1=Martin J.|last2=Fife|first2=James|title=The Celtic Languages|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdTGWVa25AkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=history+of+cornish+language&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqmfuHrfbOAhWPNx4KHeC4AXIQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q=brittany&f=false|accessdate=4 September 2016}}</ref> The earliest written record of the Cornish language comes from this period; a 9th-century [[Gloss (annotation)|gloss]] in a [[Latin]] [[manuscript]] of ''{{lang|la|[[Consolation of Philosophy|De Consolatione Philosophiae]]}}'' by [[Boethius]], which used the words ''{{lang|kw|ud rocashaas}}''.

Most important is the ''[[Ordinalia]]'', a cycle of three mystery plays, ''Origo Mundi'', ''Passio Christi'' and ''Resurrexio Domini''.  Together these provide about 20,000 lines of text. Various plays were written by the canons of [[Glasney College]], intended to educate the Cornish people about the Bible and the Celtic saints. From this period also is ''{{lang|kw|[[Beunans Meriasek]]}}'' and the recently discovered ''{{lang|kw|[[Bewnans Ke]]}}''.\n\nIn the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], an [[report|account]] was given by [[Andrew Boorde]] in his 1542 ''Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge''.

The intention of the Act was to replace worship in [[Latin]] with worship in English, which was known by the lawmakers not to be universally spoken throughout England. Instead of merely banning Latin, the Act was framed so as to enforce English. The [[Prayer Book Rebellion]], which may also have been influenced by the retaliation of the English after the failed [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]], broke out, and was ruthlessly suppressed: over 4,000 people who protested against the imposition of an English prayer book were massacred by [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] army. Their leaders were executed and the people suffered numerous reprisals.\n\nThe rebels' document claimed they wanted a return to the old religious services and ended, \"We the Cornishmen (whereof certain of us understand no English) utterly refuse this new English [altered spelling].\" [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], Duke of [[Somerset]], replied to the Cornishmen, inquiring as to why they should be offended by services in English when they had them in Latin, which they also did not understand.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rose-Troup|first1=Frances|title=The Western Rebellion of 1549|date=1913|publisher=Smith|location=London|pages=435\u201336|url=https://archive.org/stream/westernrebellion00rose#page/434/mode/2up|accessdate=4 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cornish language shift.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|A map showing the westward decline of Cornish, 1300\u20131750]]\nThrough many factors, including loss of life and the spread of English, the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] proved a turning-point for the Cornish language.<ref name = \"Mills\">{{cite journal|last1=Mills |first1=Jon |date=2010 |title=Genocide and Ethnocide: The Suppression of the Cornish Language |url= https://kar.kent.ac.uk/27912/2/Mills%2C%20Jon%20%282010%29%20Genocide%20and%20Ethnocide%20-%20The%20Suppression%20of%20the%20Cornish%20Language%20%28not%20for%20distribution%29.pdf|journal=Interfaces in Language |pages=189-206 |doi=10.13140/2.1.1439.5843 }} </ref> Peter Berresford-Ellis cites the years 1550\u20131650 as a century of immense damage for the language, and its decline can be traced to this period.

In his ''Survey of Cornwall'', published in 1602, [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] writes:<blockquote>[M]ost of the inhabitants can speak no word of Cornish, but very few are ignorant of the English; and yet some so affect their own, as to a stranger they will not speak it; for if meeting them by chance, you inquire the way, or any such matter, your answer shall be, \"{{lang|kw|Meea navidna caw zasawzneck}},\" \"I [will] speak no Saxonage.\"<ref name=\"Carew1811\">{{cite book |last=Carew |first=Richard |title=Carew's Survey of Cornwall: to which are added, notes illustrative of its history and antiquities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhTOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA152 |accessdate=13 February 2013 |year=1811 |publisher=Printed by T.

Written sources from this period are often spelled following English spelling conventions since the majority of writers of the time had had no exposure to Middle Cornish texts or the Cornish orthography within them, although after 1700 some writers began to adopt the orthography used by Edward Lhuyd in his Archaeologia Brittanica, for example using the circumflex to denote long vowels.  In 1776, [[William Bodinar]], who had learnt Cornish from fishermen, wrote a letter in Cornish which was probably the last prose in the language. However, the last verse was the ''[[Cranken Rhyme]]'', written in the late 19th century by [[John Davey (Cornish speaker)|John Davey]] of [[Boswednack]].\n\nThe [[Last speaker of the Cornish language|last native speakers of Cornish]] are thought to have died by the end of the 18th century.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, there was academic interest in the language and in attempting to find the [[last speaker of Cornish]]. This academic interest, along with the beginning of the [[Celtic Revival]] in the late 19th century, provided the groundwork for a Cornish language revival movement.\n\n===Decline of Cornish speakers 1200 to 1800<ref name = \"ken\"/><ref name = \"stalmaszczyk\">{{cite journal|last1=Stalmaszczyk |first1=Piotr |date=1997 |title=Cornish Language and Literature: A brief introduction |url=http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.hdl_11089_14418 |journal= Acta Universitatis Lodziensis.

The publication of this book is often considered to be the point at which the revival movement started.\n\nThe revival focused on reconstructing and standardising the language, including coining new words for modern concepts, and creating educational material in order to teach Cornish to others. In 1929 [[Robert Morton Nance]] published his [[Unified Cornish]] system, based on the Middle Cornish literature while extending the attested vocabulary with forms based on Celtic roots also found in Breton and Welsh, publishing a dictionary in 1938. Nance's work became the basis of revived Cornish for most of the 20th century. However, as the revival grew in strength and focus shifted from written to spoken Cornish, Nance's stiff, archaic formulation of the language seemed less suitable for a spoken revival, and academic research into the traditional literature proved that the Unified system lacked some phonological distinctions.\n\nIn the 1980s, in response to dissatisfaction with Unified Cornish, [[Ken George]] published a new system, {{lang|kw|[[Kernewek Kemmyn]]}} (\"Common Cornish\"). Like Unified Cornish, it retained a Middle Cornish base but implemented an orthography that aspired to be as [[phonemic orthography|phonemic]] as possible. It was subsequently adopted by the Cornish Language Board as well as by many Cornish speakers, but came under fierce criticism by academic linguists for its phonological base, as well as those who found its orthography too different from traditional Cornish spelling conventions. Also during this period, [[Richard Gendall]] created his [[Modern Cornish]] system (also known as \"Revived Late Cornish\"), which used Late Cornish as a basis, and [[Nicholas Williams]] published a revised version of Unified; however neither of these systems gained the popularity of Unified or Kemmyn.\n\nThe revival entered a period of factionalism and public disputes, with each orthography attempting to push the others aside. By the time that Cornish was recognised by the UK government under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 2002, it had become recognised that the existence of multiple orthographies was unsustainable with regards to using the language in education and public life, as none had achieved a wide consensus. A process of unification was set about which resulted in the creation of the public-body [[Cornish Language Partnership]] in 2005 and agreement on a [[Standard Written Form]] in 2008.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7074487.stm |title=Breakthrough for Cornish language |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7408686.stm |title=Standard Cornish spelling agreed |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> In 2010 UNESCO altered its classification of Cornish, stating that its previous label of \"extinct\" was no longer accurate.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> This was seen by Cornish speakers as a milestone, turning the language from a state of undergoing revival, to having been revived.\n\nThe modern-day Cornish language is a successfully revived language with a number of speakers that is slowly increasing, and is becoming more visible in Cornwall as local government and business are encouraged to make use of the language as part of revitalisation efforts.\n\n== Geographic distribution and number of speakers ==\n[[File:Szyld kornwalijski w Penzance.jpg|thumb|right|Cornish can be seen in many places in [[Cornwall]]]]\nSpeakers of Cornish reside primarily in [[Cornwall]], which has a population of 563,600 (2017 estimate).

The grammatical features most unfamiliar to English speakers of the language are the initial consonant mutations, the [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] word order, [[inflected preposition]]s, fronting of emphasised syntactic elements, and the use of two different forms for \"to be\". Cornish nouns belong to one of two [[grammatical gender]]s, masculine and feminine, but are not inflected for [[grammatical case|case]]. Cornish has a variety of different endings to indicate the plural, and some nouns have a third collective form. Verbs are [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] for [[Tense-aspect-mood|tense and mood]], which can be indicated either by inflection of the main verb, or by the use of auxiliary verbs. In Cornish vocabulary, a large number of the lexical items are language and culture specific. Examples of these include the Cornish word ''{{lang|kw|atal}}'', which means \"mine waste\" and the word ''{{lang|kw|beetia}}'', which means \"to mend fishing nets\". ''{{lang|kw|Foogan}}'' and ''{{lang|kw|hogan}}'' are different types of pastry cakes. ''{{lang|kw|Troyl}}'' is culture specific when referring to \"a traditional Cornish dance get-together\", while ''{{lang|kw|Furry}}'' is a specific kind of ceremonial dance that takes place in Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mills |first=Jon |title=The Vocabularium Cornicum: a Cornish vocabulary?|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/zcph.2013.60.issue-1/zcph.2013.009/zcph.2013.009.xml |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr celtische Philologie |volume=60 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/zcph.2013.009 }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, Cornish translates the English noun, \"book\", as ''{{lang|kw|[[wikt:lyver|lyver]]}}'' (cognate with [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''{{lang|cy|[[wikt:llyfr|llyfr]]}}'', but ''{{lang|kw|lyver}}'' can actually be translated into English as \"book\" or \"volume\" because it can be considered one in a set of books.\n\nAs in other Celtic languages, Cornish lacks a number of verbs that are commonly found in other languages. This includes modals and psych-verbs;<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Padel |first=Oliver |title=The nature and date of the Old Cornish Vocabulary |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/zcph.2014.61.issue-1/zcph.2014.009/zcph.2014.009.xml |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr celtische Philologie |volume=61 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/zcph.2014.009 }}</ref> examples \"have\", \"like\", \"hate\", \"prefer\", \"must\"/\"have to\", \"make\"/\"compel to\". These functions are instead fulfilled by periphrastic constructions involving a verb and various prepositional phrases.\n* ''Initial [[consonant mutation]]'':  The first sound of a Cornish word may change according to grammatical context. As in Breton, there are four types of mutation in Cornish (compared to three in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], two in [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], and one in [[Scottish Gaelic]]).  These are known as ''soft'' (''b'' > ''v'', etc.), ''hard'' (''b'' > ''p''), ''aspirate'' (''b'' unchanged, ''t'' > ''th'') and ''mixed'' (''b'' > ''f'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Consonant mutation in Cornish\n!

For example, ''{{lang|kw|gans}}'' (with, by) + ''{{lang|kw|my}}'' (me) \u2192 ''{{lang|kw|genev}}''; ''{{lang|kw|gans}}'' + ''{{lang|kw|ev}}'' (him) \u2192 ''{{lang|kw|ganso}}''.\n* ''No indefinite [[article (grammar)|article]].''

He was the first person to realise the language was dying out and wrote detailed manuscripts which he started working on when he was 78. The only version that was ever published was a short first draft, but the final version, which he worked on until his death, is a few hundred pages long. At the same time a group of scholars, led by [[John Keigwin]] (nephew of William Scawen), of Mousehole, tried to preserve and further the Cornish language. They left behind a large number of translations of parts of the Bible, proverbs and songs. This group was contacted by the Welsh linguist [[Edward Lhuyd]] who came to Cornwall to study the language.<ref>Ellis, P. B. (1974); pp. 82\u201394</ref><ref>Lhuyd, Edward (1707) ''Arch\u00e6ologia Britannica: giving some account additional to what has been hitherto publish'd, of the languages, histories and customs of the original inhabitants of Great Britain, from collections and observations in travels through Wales, Cornwal, Bas-Bretagne, Ireland, and Scotland; Vol. I.

Oxonii: e Theatro Sheldoniano</ref>\n\nEarly Modern Cornish was the subject of a study published by Lhuyd in 1707, and differs from the medieval language in having a considerably simpler structure and grammar. Such differences included the wide use of certain modal affixes that, although out of use by Lhuyd's time, had a considerable effect on the word-order of medieval Cornish{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The medieval language also possessed two additional tenses for expressing past events and an extended set of possessive suffixes.\n\n[[John Whitaker (historian)|John Whitaker]], the Manchester-born rector of [[Ruan Lanihorne]], studied the decline of the Cornish language. In his 1804 work ''the Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall'' he concluded that: \"[T]he English Liturgy, was not desired by the Cornish, but forced upon them by the tyranny of England, at a time when the English language was yet unknown in Cornwall. This act of tyranny was at once gross barbarity to the Cornish people, and a death blow to the Cornish language.\".<ref>Jago, Fred W. P. (1882) ''The Ancient Language and the Dialect of Cornwall''. New York: AMS Press, 1983, (originally published 1882, Netherton and Worth, Truro), pp. 4 ff.</ref>\n\nRobert Williams published the first comprehensive Cornish dictionary in 1865, the ''Lexicon Cornu-Britannicum''. As a result of the discovery of additional ancient Cornish manuscripts, 2000 new words were added to the vocabulary by [[Whitley Stokes (scholar)|Whitley Stokes]] in ''A Cornish Glossary''. William C. Borlase published ''Proverbs and Rhymes in Cornish'' in 1866 while ''A Glossary of Cornish Place Names'' was produced by John Bannister in the same year. [[Fred W. P. Jago|Frederick Jago]] published his ''English\u2013Cornish Dictionary'' in 1882.\n\nIn 2002, the Cornish language gained new recognition because of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. Conversely, along with government provision was the governmental basis of \"New Public Management,\" measuring quantifiable results as means of determining effectiveness. This put enormous pressure on finding a single orthography that could be used in unison. The revival of Cornish required extensive rebuilding. The Cornish orthographies that were reconstructed may be considered versions of Cornish because they are not traditional sociolinguistic variations. In the middle-to-late twentieth century, the debate over Cornish orthographies angered more people because several language groups received public funding. This caused other groups to sense favouritism as playing a role in the debate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sayers|first=Dave|date=2012|title=Standardising Cornish: The Politics Of A New Minority Language|url=http://shura.shu.ac.uk/10586|journal=Language Problems and Language Planning|volume=36|issue=2|pages=99\u2013119|doi=10.1075/lplp.36.2.01say|access-date=24 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nA governmental policymaking structure called New Public Management (NPM) has helped the Cornish language by managing public life of the Cornish language and people.

MAGA established an \"Ad-Hoc Group,\" which resulted in three orthographies being presented. The relations for the Ad-Hoc Group were to obtain consensus among the three orthographies, and then develop a \"single written form.\" The end result was creating a new form of Cornish, which had to be natural for both new learners and skilled speakers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Review of ''Faction and Faith.

Long before the agreement of the [[Standard Written Form|Standard Written Form of Cornish]] in the 21st century, Late Cornish orthography in the [[Early Modern]] period usually followed Welsh to English transliteration so phonetically rendering C for K, I for Y, U for W, and Z for S, caused place names such as Porthcurno and Penzance to be adopted into English instead of their Standard Written Form ''Porth Kernow'' and ''Pen Sans''. Likewise, words such as Enys (\"island\") can be found spelled as \"Ince\" as at [[Ince Castle]]. These apparent mistranslations can however reveal an insight into how names and places were actually pronounced, explaining, for example, how anglicised [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] is still pronounced \"Lann-zan\" from Cornish \"Lann Stefan\" with emphasis on the first element.\n\nThe following tables present some examples of Cornish placenames and surnames, and their anglicised versions:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Opposite her was [[Scylla]], another sea monster, that lived inside a much larger rock.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Odyssey|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Book XII}}</ref> The sides of the strait were within an arrow-shot of each other, and sailors attempting to avoid one of them would come in reach of the other. To be \"[[between Scylla and Charybdis]]\" therefore means to be presented with two opposite dangers, the task being to find a route that avoids both. Three times a day, Charybdis swallowed a huge amount of water, before belching it back out again, creating large whirlpools capable of dragging a ship underwater. In some variations of the story, Charybdis was simply a large [[whirlpool]] instead of a sea monster.\n\nThe theoretical size of Charybdis remains unknown, yet in order to consume [[Greece|Greek]] ships the whirlpool can be estimated to about 23 meters (75&nbsp;ft) across. Charybdis has been associated with{{qualify evidence}} the [[Strait of Messina]], off the [[coast]] of [[Sicily]] and opposite a rock on the mainland identified with Scylla.<ref>[[Thucydides]].  ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=thuc.%204.24 4.24.5].''</ref> Were Charybdis to be located in the Strait of Messina it would in fact have the size to accommodate the whirlpool. A whirlpool does exist there, caused by currents meeting, but it is dangerous only to small craft in extreme conditions.\n\n== Genealogy ==\nA later myth makes Charybdis the daughter of [[Poseidon]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]<ref>[[Scholia|Scholiast]] on Homer's ''Odyssey''</ref> and living as a loyal servant to her father.[[File:Strait of Messina, cariddi.JPG|thumb|The narrowest point of [[Strait of Messina]] as seen from the village of Torre Faro]]\n\n==Mythology==\n\n=== Origin ===\nCharybdis aided her father Poseidon in his feud with her paternal uncle Zeus and, as such, helped him engulf lands and islands in water. Zeus, angry over the land she stole from him, captured and chained her to the sea-bed. Charybdis was then cursed by the god into a hideous bladder of a monster, with flippers for arms and legs, and an uncontrollable thirst for the sea. As such, she drank the water from the sea thrice a day to quench it, which created whirlpools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Monsters/Charybdis/charybdis.html|title=Charybdis|website=www.[[greekmythology]].com|accessdate=5 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Pontios/Kharybdis.html|title=CHARYBDIS (Kharybdis) - Whirlpool Monster of Greek Mythology|website=www.[[theoi]].com|accessdate=5 October 2016}}</ref> She lingered on a rock with Scylla facing her directly on another rock, making a strait.\n\n===The ''Odyssey''===\n[[File:Scylla and Charybdis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A 19th-century engraving of the Strait of Messina, the site associated with Scylla and Charybdis]] [[Odysseus]] faced both Charybdis and Scylla while rowing through a narrow channel. He ordered his men to avoid Charybdis, thus forcing them to pass near Scylla, which resulted in the deaths of six of his men. Later, stranded on a raft, Odysseus was swept back through the strait and passed near Charybdis. His raft was sucked into her maw, but he survived by clinging to a fig tree growing on a rock over her lair.
