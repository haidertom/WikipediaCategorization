In this manner, while all ''books on magic'' could be thought of as grimoires, not all ''magical books'' should be thought of as grimoires.<ref>Davies (2009:2-3)</ref>\n\nWhile the term ''grimoire'' is originally European and many Europeans throughout history, particularly [[ceremonial magic]]ians and [[cunning folk]], have made use of grimoires, the historian [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]] noted that similar books can be found all across the world, ranging from [[Jamaica]] to [[Sumatra]].<ref>Davies (2009:2-5)</ref> He also noted that in this sense, the world's first grimoires were created in [[Europe]] and the [[Ancient Near East]].<ref>Davies (2009:6-7)</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nIt is most commonly believed that the term ''grimoire'' originated from the [[Old French language|Old French]] word ''grammaire'', which had initially been used to refer to all books written in [[Latin]]. By the 18th century, the term had gained its now common usage in France, and had begun to be used to refer purely to books of magic. Owen Davies presumed this was because \"many of them continued to circulate in Latin manuscripts\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nHowever, the term ''grimoire'' later developed into a [[figure of speech]] amongst the French indicating something that was hard to understand. In the 19th century, with the increasing interest in [[occultism]] amongst the British following the publication of [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett's]] ''[[The Magus (handbook)|The Magus]]'' (1801), the term entered the English language in reference to books of magic.<ref name=\"Davies 2009:1\"/>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient period ===\n\nThe earliest known written magical incantations come from ancient [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]), where they have been found inscribed on [[cuneiform]] clay tablets that [[archaeology|archaeologists]] excavated from the city of [[Uruk]] and dated to between the 5th and 4th centuries BC.<ref>Davies (2009:8)</ref> The [[ancient Egypt]]ians also employed magical incantations, which have been found inscribed on amulets and other items. The Egyptian magical system, known as [[heka (god)|heka]], was greatly altered and enhanced after the Macedonians, led by [[Alexander the Great]], invaded Egypt in 332 BC.<ref name=\"Davies 2009:8-9\">Davies (2009:8-9)</ref>\n\nUnder the next three centuries of [[Hellenistic Egypt]], the [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] writing system evolved, and the [[Library of Alexandria]] was opened. This likely had an influence upon books of magic, with the trend on known incantations switching from simple health and protection charms to more specific things, such as financial success and sexual fulfillment.<ref name=\"Davies 2009:8-9\"/> Around this time the legendary figure of [[Hermes Trismegistus]] developed as a conflation of the Egyptian god [[Thoth]] and the Greek [[Hermes]]; this figure was associated with writing and magic and, therefore, of books on magic.<ref name=\"Davies 2009:10\">Davies (2009:10)</ref>\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] believed that books on magic were invented by the [[Ancient Persia|Persians]]. The 1st-century AD writer [[Pliny the Elder]] stated that magic had been first discovered by the ancient philosopher [[Zoroaster]] around the year 647 BC but that it was only written down in the 5th century BC by the magician [[Osthanes]]. His claims are not, however, supported by modern historians.<ref name=\"Davies 2009:7\">Davies (2009:7)</ref>\n\nThe ancient [[Hebrews|Jewish]] people were often viewed as being knowledgeable in magic, which, according to legend, they had learned from [[Moses]], who had learned it in Egypt. Among many ancient writers, Moses was seen as an Egyptian rather than a Jew. Two manuscripts likely dating to the 4th century, both of which purport to be the legendary eighth Book of Moses (the first five being the initial books in the Biblical [[Old Testament]]), present him as a [[polytheism|polytheist]] who explained how to conjure gods and subdue demons.<ref name=\"Davies 2009:10\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, there is definite evidence of grimoires being used by certain, particularly [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]], sects of [[early Christianity]]. In the ''[[Book of Enoch]]'' found within the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], for instance, there is information on [[astrology]] and the [[angels]]. In possible connection with the ''Book of Enoch'', the idea of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and his great-grandson [[Noah]] having some involvement with books of magic given to them by angels continued through to the medieval period.<ref name=\"Davies 2009:7\"/>\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|quote=\"Many of those [in [[Ephesus]]] who believed [in Christianity] now came and openly confessed their evil deeds.

In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.\"|source=[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 19, c. 1st century}}\n\nIsraelite King [[Solomon]] was a Biblical figure associated with magic and sorcery in the ancient world. The 1st-century Romano-Jewish historian [[Josephus]] mentioned a book circulating under the name of Solomon that contained incantations for summoning demons and described how a Jew called Eleazar used it to cure cases of [[demonic possession|possession]]. The book may have been the ''[[Testament of Solomon]]'' but was more probably a different work.<ref name=butler>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=E. M.|authorlink=Eliza Marian Butler |title=Ritual Magic |year=1979 |publisher=[[CUP Archive]] |isbn=0-521-29553-X |edition=Reprint |chapter=The Solomonic Cycle}}</ref> The [[pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphic]] ''Testament of Solomon'' is one of the oldest magical texts. It is a Greek manuscript attributed to Solomon and likely written in either Babylonia or Egypt sometime in the first five centuries AD, over 1,000 years after Solomon's death.\n\nThe work tells of the building of [[The Temple]] and relates that construction was hampered by demons until the angel [[Michael]] gave the king a magical ring. The ring, engraved with the [[Seal of Solomon]], had the power to bind [[demons]] from doing harm. Solomon used it to lock demons in jars and commanded others to do his bidding, although eventually, according to the ''Testament'', he was tempted into worshiping \"false gods\", such as [[Moloch]], [[Baal]], and [[Rapha (god)|Rapha]]. Subsequently, after losing favour with God, King Solomon wrote the work as a warning and a guide to the reader.<ref>Davies (2009:12-13)</ref>\n\nWhen Christianity became the dominant faith of the [[Roman Empire]], the early Church frowned upon the propagation of books on magic, connecting it with [[paganism]], and [[book burning|burned books of magic]]. The [[New Testament]] records that after the unsuccessful exorcism by the seven sons of [[Sceva]] became known, many converts decided to [[Book burning at Ephesus|burn their own magic and pagan books]] in the city of [[Ephesus]]; this advice was adopted on a large scale after the Christian ascent to power.<ref>Davies (2009:18-20)</ref> Even before Christianisation, the Imperial Roman government had suppressed many pagan, Christian, philosophical, and divinatory texts that it viewed as threats to Roman authority, including those of the Greek mystic and mathematician [[Pythagoras]].\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nIn the [[Medieval]] period, the production of grimoires continued in [[Christendom]], as well as amongst [[Jews]] and the followers of the newly founded [[Islam|Islamic faith]]. As the historian Owen Davies noted, \"while the [Christian] Church was ultimately successful in defeating pagan worship it never managed to demarcate clearly and maintain a line of practice between religious devotion and magic.\"<ref>Davies (2009:21-22)</ref> The use of such books on magic continued. In Christianised Europe, the Church divided books of magic into two kinds: those that dealt with \"natural magic\" and those that dealt in \"demonic magic\".<ref name=\"Davies 2009:22\">Davies (2009:22)</ref>\n\nThe former was acceptable because it was viewed as merely taking note of the powers in nature that were created by [[God]]; for instance, the [[Anglo-Saxon]] leechbooks, which contained simple spells for medicinal purposes, were tolerated. Demonic magic was not acceptable, because it was believed that such magic did not come from God, but from the [[Devil]] and his [[demons]]. These grimoires dealt in such topics as [[necromancy]], [[divination]] and [[demonology]].<ref name=\"Davies 2009:22\"/> Despite this, \"there is ample evidence that the mediaeval clergy were the main practitioners of magic and therefore the owners, transcribers, and circulators of grimoires,\"<ref>Davies (2009:36)</ref> while several grimoires were attributed to [[Popes]].<ref>Davies (2009:34-35)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sefer raziel segulot.png|thumb|250px|An excerpt from ''[[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh]]'', featuring magical [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]] (or \u05e1\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea, ''seguloth'', in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]).]]\nOne such Arabic grimoire devoted to astral magic, the 12th-century ''Gh\u00e2yat al-Hak\u00eem fi'l-sihr'', was later translated into Latin and circulated in Europe during the 13th century under the name of the ''[[Picatrix]]''.<ref>Davies (2009:25-26)</ref> However, not all such grimoires of this era were based upon Arabic sources. The 13th-century [[The Sworn Book of Honorius|''Sworn Book of Honorius'']], for instance, was (like the ancient ''Testament of Solomon'' before it) largely based on the supposed teachings of the Biblical king [[Solomon]] and included ideas such as prayers and a [[ritual circle]], with the [[mysticism|mystical]] purpose of having visions of God, [[Hell]], and [[Purgatory]] and gaining much wisdom and knowledge as a result. Another was the Hebrew ''[[Sefer Raziel Ha-Malakh]]'', translated in Europe as the ''Liber Razielis Archangeli''.<ref>Davies (2009:34)</ref>\n\nA later book also claiming to have been written by Solomon was originally written in Greek during the 15th century, where it was known as the ''[[Magical Treatise of Solomon]]'' or the ''Little Key of the Whole Art of Hygromancy, Found by Several Craftsmen and by the Holy Prophet Solomon''. In the 16th century, this work had been translated into Latin and Italian, being renamed the ''Clavicula Salomonis'', or the ''[[Key of Solomon]]''.<ref>Davies (2009:15)</ref>\n\nIn Christendom during the medieval age, grimoires were written that were attributed to other ancient figures, thereby supposedly giving them a sense of authenticity because of their antiquity. The German abbot and occultist [[Trithemius]] (1462\u20131516) supposedly had a ''Book of Simon the Magician'', based upon the New Testament figure of [[Simon Magus]]. Simon Magus had been a contemporary of [[Jesus Christ]]'s and, like the Biblical Jesus, had supposedly performed miracles, but had been demonized by the Medieval Church as a [[satanism|devil worshiper]] and evil individual.<ref>Davies (2009:16-17)</ref>\n\nSimilarly, it was commonly believed by medieval people that other ancient figures, such as the poet [[Virgil]], astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and philosopher [[Aristotle]], had been involved in magic, and grimoires claiming to have been written by them were circulated.<ref>Davies (2009:24)</ref> However, there were those who did not believe this; for instance, the [[Franciscan]] friar [[Roger Bacon]] (c.&nbsp;1214\u201394) stated that books falsely claiming to be by ancient authors \"ought to be prohibited by law.\"<ref>Davies (2009:37)</ref>\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nAs the [[early modern period]] commenced in the late 15th century, many changes began to shock Europe that would have an effect on the production of grimoires. Historian Owen Davies classed the most important of these as the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]], the [[witch-hunt]]s and the advent of printing. The [[Renaissance]] saw the continuation of interest in magic that had been found in the Mediaeval period, and in this period, there was an increased interest in [[Hermeticism]] among [[occult]]ists and [[ceremonial magic]]ians in Europe, largely fueled by the 1471 translation of the ancient ''Corpus hermeticum'' into Latin by [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433\u201399).\n\nAlongside this, there was a rise in interest in the Jewish [[mysticism]] known as the [[Kabbalah]], which was spread across the continent by [[Pico della Mirandola]] and [[Johannes Reuchlin]].<ref>Davies (2009:46)</ref> The most important magician of the Renaissance was [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486\u20131535), who widely studied occult topics and earlier grimoires and eventually published his own, the ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]'', in 1533.<ref>Davies (2009:47-48)</ref> A similar figure was the Swiss magician known as [[Paracelsus]] (1493\u20131541), who published ''Of the Supreme Mysteries of Nature'', in which he emphasised the distinction between good and bad magic.<ref>Davies (2009:48)</ref> A third such individual was [[Johann Georg Faust]], upon whom several pieces of later literature were written, such as [[Christopher Marlow]]e's ''Doctor [[Doctor Faustus (play)|Faust]]us'', that portrayed him as consulting with demons.<ref>Davies (2009:49-50)</ref>\n\nThe idea of [[demonology]] had remained strong in the Renaissance, and several demonological grimoires were published, including ''The Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy'', which falsely claimed to having been authored by Agrippa,<ref>Davies (2009:51-52)</ref> and the ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', which listed 69 demons. To counter this, the Roman Catholic Church authorised the production of many works of [[exorcism]], the rituals of which were often very similar to those of demonic conjuration.<ref>Davies (2009:59-60)</ref> Alongside these demonological works, grimoires on natural magic continued to be produced, including ''Magia naturalis'', written by [[Giambattista Della Porta]] (1535\u20131615).<ref>Davies (2009:57)</ref>\n\n[[File:Pentagram and human body (Agrippa).jpg|thumb|A man inscribed in a [[pentagram]], from [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s ''De Occulta Philosophia'' (Eng., ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''). The signs on the perimeter are [[astrology|astrological]].]]\n\nThe advent of [[printing]] in Europe meant that books could be mass-produced for the first time and could reach an ever-growing literate audience. Among the earliest books to be printed were magical texts. The ''n\u00f3minas'' were one example, consisting of prayers to the saints used as talismans.<ref>Davies (2009:45)</ref> It was particularly in [[Protestant]] countries, such as Switzerland and the German states, which were not under the domination of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], where such grimoires were published.\n\nDespite the advent of print, however, handwritten grimoires remained highly valued, as they were believed to contain inherent magical powers, and they continued to be produced.<ref>Davies (2009:53-54)</ref> With increasing availability, people lower down the social scale and women began to have access to books on magic; this was often incorporated into the popular [[folk magic]] of the average people and, in particular, that of the [[cunning folk]], who were professionally involved in folk magic.<ref>Davies (2009:66-67)</ref> These works left Europe and were imported to the parts of Latin America controlled by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires and the parts of North America controlled by the [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] empires.<ref>Davies (2009:84-90)</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, the [[Inquisition]], a Roman Catholic organisation, had organised the mass suppression of peoples and beliefs that they considered [[heresy|heretical]]. In many cases, grimoires were found in the heretics' possessions and destroyed.<ref>Davies (2009:54-55)</ref> In 1599, the church published the ''Indexes of Prohibited Books'', in which many grimoires were listed as forbidden, including several mediaeval ones, such as the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'', which were still popular.<ref>Davies (2009:74)</ref>\n\nIn Christendom, there also began to develop a widespread fear of [[witchcraft]], which was believed to be [[Satanism|Satanic]] in nature. The subsequent hysteria, known as the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|Witch Hunt]], caused the death of around 40,000 people, most of whom were women.<ref name=\"Patrick 2007 p. 802\">{{cite book | last=Patrick | first=J. | title=Renaissance and Reformation | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-7614-7650-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JDOVMDi8d4C&pg=PA802 | accessdate=2017-05-07 | page=802}}</ref> Sometimes, those found with grimoires, particularly demonological ones, were prosecuted and dealt with as witches but, in most cases, those accused had no access to such books. Highly literate [[Iceland]] proved an exception to this, where a third of the 134 witch trials held involved people who had owned grimoires.<ref>Davies (2009:70-73)</ref> By the end of the Early Modern period and the beginning of [[the Enlightenment]], many European governments brought in laws prohibiting many superstitious beliefs in an attempt to bring an end to the Witch Hunt; this would invariably affect the release of grimoires.\n\nMeanwhile, Hermeticism and the Kabbalah would influence the creation of a mystical philosophy known as [[Rosicrucianism]], which first appeared in the early 17th century, when two pamphlets detailing the existence of the mysterious Rosicrucian group were published in Germany. These claimed that Rosicrucianism had originated with a Medieval figure known as [[Christian Rosenkreuz]], who had founded the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross; however, there was no evidence for the existence of Rosenkreuz or the Brotherhood.<ref>Davies (2009:47)</ref>\n\n=== 18th and 19th centuries ===\n{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=\"Emperor [[Lucifer]], master of all the [[fallen angel|rebel spirits]], I beg you to favour me in the call that I am making to your grand minister LUCIFUG\u00c9 ROFOCALE, desiring to make a pact with him; I beg you also, prince [[Beelzebub]] to protect me in my undertaking.

However, amongst much of Europe, belief in magic and witchcraft persisted,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} as did the witch trials in certain{{which|date=August 2012}} areas. Governments tried to crack down on magicians and fortune tellers, particularly in France, where the police viewed them as social pests who took money from the gullible, often in a search for [[treasure]]. In doing so, they confiscated many grimoires.<ref>Davies (2007:95-96)</ref>\n\nA new form of printing developed in France, the ''[[Biblioth\u00e8que bleue]]''. Many grimoires published through this circulated among an ever-growing percentage{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} of the populace, in particular the ''Grand Albert'', the ''[[Petit Albert]]'' (1782), the ''Grimoire du Pape Honorius'' and the ''[[Grimoire of Pope Leo|Enchiridion Leonis Papae]]''. The ''Petit Albert'' contained a wide variety of forms of magic, for instance, dealing in simple charms for ailments along with more complex things such as the instructions for making a [[Hand of Glory]].<ref>Davies (2007:98-101)</ref>\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, following the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, a hugely influential grimoire was published under the title of the ''[[Grand Grimoire]]'', which was considered{{by whom|date=August 2012}} particularly powerful, because it involved conjuring and making a pact with the devil's chief minister, [[Lucifuge Rofocale|Lucifug\u00e9 Rofocale]], to gain wealth from him. A new version of this grimoire was later published under the title of the ''Dragon rouge'' and was available for sale in many Parisian bookstores.<ref>Davies (2007:101-104)</ref> Similar books published in France at the time included the ''[[Black Pullet]]'' and the ''[[Grimoirium Verum]]''. The ''Black Pullet'', probably authored in late-18th-century Rome or France, differs from the typical grimoires in that it does not claim to be a manuscript from antiquity but told by a man who was a member of [[Napoleon]]'s armed expeditionary forces in Egypt.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Magic and Alchemy |author=[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |title=grimoire |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] | year=2006 |isbn= 1-4381-3000-7}}</ref>\n\nThe widespread availability of printed grimoires in France\u2014despite the opposition of both the rationalists and the church\u2014soon{{when|date=August 2012}} spread to neighbouring countries such as Spain and Germany. In Switzerland, [[Geneva]] was commonly associated with the occult at the time, particularly by Catholics, because it had been a stronghold of Protestantism. Many of those interested in the esoteric traveled from Roman Catholic nations to Switzerland to purchase grimoires or to study with occultists.<ref>Davies (2007:109-110)</ref> Soon, grimoires appeared that involved Catholic saints; one example that appeared during the 19th century that became relatively popular, particularly in Spain, was the ''Libro de San Cipriano'', or ''The Book of St. Ciprian'', which falsely claimed to date from c.&nbsp;1000. Like most grimoires of this period, it dealt with (among other things) how to discover treasure.<ref>Davies (2007:114-115)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sixthandseventhbooks frontpiece 1880.png|thumb|The title page of the 1880 New York edition of ''The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses''.]]\n\nIn Germany, with the increased interest in [[folklore]] during the 19th century, many historians took an interest in magic and in grimoires. Several published extracts of such grimoires in their own books on the history of magic, thereby helping to further propagate them. Perhaps the most notable of these was the Protestant pastor Georg Conrad Horst (1779\u20131832), who from 1821 to 1826, published a six-volume collection of magical texts in which he studied grimoires as a peculiarity of the Mediaeval mindset.<ref>Davies (2007:121-122)</ref>\n\nAnother scholar of the time interested in grimoires, the antiquarian bookseller Johann Scheible, first published the ''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]'', two influential magical texts that claimed to have been written by the ancient Jewish figure [[Moses]].<ref>Davies (2007:123)</ref> ''The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses'' were among the works that later spread to the countries of [[Scandinavia]], where, in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], grimoires were known as [[Cyprianus|black books]] and were commonly found among members of the army.<ref>Davies (2007:134-136)</ref>\n\nIn Britain, new grimoires continued to be produced throughout the 18th century, such as [[Ebenezer Sibly]]'s ''A New and Complete Illustration of the Celestial Science of Astrology''. In the last decades of that century, London experienced a revival of interest in the occult that was further propagated when [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]] published ''[[The Magus (book)|The Magus]]'' in 1801. ''The Magus'' contained many things taken from older grimoires, particularly those of Cornelius Agrippa, and while not achieving initial popularity upon release, gradually became an influential text.<ref>Davies (2007:123-124)</ref>\n\nOne of Barrett's pupils, John Parkin, created his own handwritten grimoire, ''The Grand Oracle of Heaven, or, The Art of Divine Magic'', although it was never published, largely because Britain [[Napoleonic wars|was at war with France]], and grimoires were commonly associated with the French. The only writer to publish British grimoires widely in the early 19th century, Robert Cross Smith, released ''The Philosophical Merlin'' (1822) and ''The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century'' (1825), but neither sold well.<ref>Davies (2007:135-137)</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, several of these texts (including ''[[The Book of Abramelin]]'' and the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'') were reclaimed by para-[[Masonic]] magical organisations, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].\n\n=== 20th and 21st centuries ===\n''[[The Secret Grimoire of Turiel]]'' claims to have been written in the 16th century, but no copy older than 1927 has been produced.<ref>{{cite book |last= Malchus |first= Marius |title= The Secret Grimoire of Turiel |publisher= Theophania Publishing |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-1-926842-80-6}}</ref>\n\nA modern grimoire, the ''[[Simon Necronomicon]]'', takes its name from a fictional book of magic in the stories of [[H.&nbsp;P.

Although the architecture created frustrating obstacles, the design that was initially a predicament ultimately became beneficial to the marketing of the theatre. The opaque furniture and gothic structures placed sporadically on the walls of the building exude a feeling of eeriness from the moment of entrance. People came to this theatre for an experience, not only to see a show. The audience at \"Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Grand-Guignol\" endured the terror of the shows because they wanted to be filled with strong \u201cfeelings\u201d of something. Many attended the shows to get a feeling of arousal.<ref name=HISTORY /> Underneath the balcony were boxes (originally built for nuns to watch church services) that were available for theatre-goers to rent during performances because they would get so aroused by the action happening on stage. It has been said that audience members would get so boisterous in the boxes, that actors would sometimes break character and yell something such as \u201cKeep it down in there!\u201d Conversely, there were audience members who could not physically handle the brutality of the actions taking place on stage. Frequently, the \u201cspecial effects\u201d would be too realistic and often an audience member would faint or vomit during performances.<ref>Hand, Richard J., and Michael Wilson.

Under his direction, the theatre produced plays about a class of people who were not considered appropriate subjects in other venues: prostitutes, criminals, street urchins and others at the lower end of [[Paris]]'s social echelon.\n\n[[Max Maurey]] served as director from 1898 to 1914. Maurey shifted the theatre's emphasis to the horror plays it would become famous for and judged the success of a performance by the number of patrons who passed out from shock; the average was two faintings each evening. Maurey discovered [[Andr\u00e9 de Lorde]], who would become the most important playwright for the theatre.\n\nDe Lorde was the theatre's principal playwright from 1901 to 1926. He wrote at least 100 plays for the Grand Guignol and collaborated with experimental psychologist [[Alfred Binet]] to create plays about insanity, one of the theatre's favourite and frequently recurring themes.\n\nCamille Choisy served as director from 1914 to 1930. He contributed his expertise in special effects and scenery to the theatre's distinctive style.\n\n{{ill|Paula Maxa|fr}} was one of the Grand Guignol's best-known performers. From 1917 to the 1930s, she performed most frequently as a victim and was known as \"the most assassinated woman in the world.\" During her career at the Grand Guignol, Maxa's characters were murdered more than 10,000 times in at least 60 different ways and raped at least 3,000 times.<ref name=\"FADING\" />\n\nJack Jouvin served as director from 1930 to 1937. He shifted the theatre's subject matter, focusing performances not on gory horror but psychological drama. Under his leadership, the theatre's popularity waned and, after [[World War II]], it was not well-attended.<ref name=HISTORY>{{cite news|last=Pierron|first=Agnes|url=http://www.grandguignol.com/history.htm|title=History|publisher=Grand Guignol Online|date=|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref>\n\nCharles Nonon was the theatre's last director.<ref name=REALITY>{{cite news|last= |first= |url=http://www.grandguignol.com/time1962.htm|title=Outdone by Reality|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 30, 1962|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==Plays==\n[[File:Grand-Guignol-Sc\u00e8ne-1937 (2).jpg|thumb|A 1937 scene from Grand Guignol]]\nAt the Grand Guignol, patrons would see five or six plays, all in a style that attempted to be brutally true to the theatre's [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] ideals. The plays were in a variety of styles, but the most popular and best known were the horror plays, featuring a distinctly bleak worldview as well as notably gory special effects in their notoriously bloody climaxes. The horrors depicted at Grand Guignol were generally not [[supernatural]]; these plays often explored the altered states, like insanity, hypnosis, or panic, under which uncontrolled horror could happen. To heighten the effect, the horror plays were often alternated with comedies.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.grandguignol.com/|title=What is Grand Guignol?|publisher=Grand Guignol Online|date=|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref><ref name=GS>{{cite news|last=Pierron|first=Agnes|url=http://www.grandguignol.com/grandstreet.htm|title=House of Horrors|work=Grand Street Magazine|date=Summer 1996|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref>\n\n''Le Laboratoire des Hallucinations'', by [[Andr\u00e9 de Lorde]]: When a doctor finds his wife's lover in his operating room, he performs a graphic brain surgery, rendering the adulterer a hallucinating semi-zombie.

Management attributed the closure in part to the fact that the theatre's faux horrors had been eclipsed by the actual events of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] two decades earlier. \"We could never equal [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]],\" said its final director, Charles Nonon. \"Before the war, everyone felt that what was happening onstage was impossible.

Shows are staged as event and draw on multiple forms of traditional physical theatrical genres in new ways including Commedia dell'arte, melodrama, mime, mask, clown, dance, vaudeville, magic, and puppetry. Many shows play with the literal 'big puppet' theme utilizing puppetry at various levels including the Petits Guignolers, a French existentially lewd finger puppet show with Grand Guignol effects. The company paid homage to its namesake by staging a surprise 200th birthday party for Guignol with ''A Grand Guignol Children's Show* (*NOT for Children)''. In addition to evenings of classic Grand Guignol, original productions have included ''A Very Grand Guignol Christmas'' and ''Absinthe, Opium and Magic, 1920s Shanghai''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn August to October 2013, the Xoregos Performing Company presented ''Danse Macabre'', a contemporary tribute to Grand Guignol at  [[Theater for the New City]] in New York City.

London at that time consisted of a city of about 448 acres surrounded by a [[London Wall|city wall]], which had originally been built to keep out raiding bands.

There was no sanitation, and open drains flowed along the centre of winding streets. The cobbles were slippery with animal dung, rubbish and the slops thrown out of the houses, muddy and buzzing with flies in summer and awash with sewage in winter. The [[City of London Corporation|City Corporation]] employed \"rakers\" to remove the worst of the filth and it was transported to mounds outside the walls where it accumulated and continued to decompose. The stench was overwhelming and people walked around with handkerchiefs or [[nosegay]]s pressed against their nostrils.<ref name=Leasor15>Leasor (1962) pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nSome of the city's necessities such as coal arrived by [[barge]], but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and pedestrians were crowded together and the gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which it was difficult to progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. The better-off used [[hackney carriage]]s and [[sedan chair]]s to get to their destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be splashed by the wheeled vehicles and drenched by slops being thrown out and water falling from the overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from factories which made [[soap]], from [[Brewery|breweries]] and iron [[Smelting|smelters]] and from about 15,000 houses burning coal.<ref name=Leasor19>Leasor (1962) pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\nOutside the city walls, suburbs had sprung up providing homes for the craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were [[shanty town]]s with wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed and over a quarter of a million people lived here.<ref name=Leasor27>Leasor (1962) pp. 24\u201327</ref> Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] who had fled the country during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.<ref name=Leasor27>Leasor (1962) pp. 24\u201327</ref>\n\nAdministration of the City of London was organised by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and common councillors, but not all  of the inhabited area generally comprising London was legally part of the City. Both inside the City and outside its boundaries there were also [[Liberty (division)|Liberties]], which were areas of varying sizes which historically had been granted rights to self-government. Many had been associated with religious institutions, and when these were abolished in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], their historic rights were transferred along with their property to new owners. The walled City was surrounded by a ring of Liberties which had come under its authority, contemporarily  called 'the City and Liberties', but these were surrounded by further suburbs with varying administrations. [[Westminster]] was an independent town with its own liberties, although it was joined to London by urban development.  The [[Tower of London]] was an independent liberty, as  were others. Areas north of the river not part of one of these administrations came under the authority of the county of [[Middlesex]], and south of the river under [[Surrey]].<ref>Porter 1999, p.15</ref>\n\n[[File:Civitas Londinium or The Agas Map of London.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodcut map of London|\"Woodcut\" map of London]], dating from the 1560s]]\nAt that time, bubonic plague was a much feared disease but its cause was not understood. The credulous blamed emanations from the earth, \"pestilential effluviums\", unusual weather, sickness in livestock, abnormal behaviour of animals or an increase in the numbers of moles, frogs, mice or flies.<ref name=Leasor42>Leasor (1962) p. 42</ref> It was not until 1894 that the identification by [[Alexandre Yersin]] of its causal agent ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' was made and the transmission of the [[bacterium]] by [[Oriental rat flea|rat fleas]] became known.<ref name=\"Bockem\u00fchl_1994\">{{cite journal|author=Bockem\u00fchl J |title=100 years after the discovery of the plague-causing agent\u2014importance and veneration of Alexandre Yersin in Vietnam today |journal=Immun Infekt |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=72\u20135 |year=1994 |pmid = 7959865}}</ref> Although the Great Plague in London had long been believed to be bubonic plague caused by ''Yersinia pestis'', this was only definitively confirmed by DNA analysis in 2016.<ref name=stanbridge2016>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37287715|title=DNA confirms cause of 1665 London's Great Plague|last=Stanbridge|first=Nicola|date=2016-09-08|website=BBC News|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\nThe third pandemic of the plague started in 1855 in China and eventually killed about 15 million people, mainly in India. In 1894, the plague hit [[Hong Kong]], a major trade port between China and US.\n\n==The recording of deaths==\n{{more|Searcher of the dead}}\nIn order to judge the severity of an epidemic, it is first necessary to know how big the population was in which it occurred.  There was no official census of the population to  provide this figure, and the best contemporary  count comes from the work of [[John Graunt]] (1620\u20131674), who was  one of the earliest [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellows of the Royal Society]] and one of the first  [[Demography|demographer]]s, bringing a scientific approach to the collection of statistics. In 1662, he estimated  that 384,000 people lived in the City of London, the Liberties, Westminster and the out-parishes, based on figures in the  [[bills of mortality]] published each week in the capital. These different districts with different administrations constituted the officially recognised extent of London as a whole. In 1665, he revised his estimate to 'not above 460,000'. Other contemporaries put the figure higher, (the French Ambassador, for example, suggested 600,000) but with no mathematical basis to support their estimates. The next largest city in the kingdom was Norwich, with a population of 30,000.<ref name=Leasor27>Leasor (1962) pp. 24\u201327</ref><ref>Bell, Folio ed. p.7</ref>\n\n[[File:Flea infected with yersinia pestis.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Infected [[Oriental rat flea]]. ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' bacteria appear as a dark mass in the gut. The bacteria block the flea's digestive system, leaving it hungry but unable to eat. Instead, when it tries to feed, it regurgitates ''Yersinia''  into the wound.]]\nThere was no duty to report a death to anyone in authority. Instead, each parish appointed two or more '[[searchers of the dead]]', whose duty was to inspect a corpse and determine the cause of death. A searcher was entitled to charge a small fee from relatives for each death they reported, and so habitually the parish would appoint someone to the post who would otherwise be destitute and would be receiving support from the parish poor rate. Typically, this meant searchers would be old women who were illiterate, might know little about identifying diseases and who would be open to dishonesty.<ref name=Bellf10>Bell Folio ed., p.&nbsp;10\u201311</ref> Searchers would typically learn about a death either from the local sexton who had been asked to dig a grave, or from the tolling of a church bell. Anyone who did not report a death to their local church, such as [[Quakers]], [[Anabaptists]], other non-Anglican Christians or [[Jewish people|Jews]], frequently did not get included in the official records. Searchers during times of plague were required to live apart  from the community and stay indoors except when performing their duties, for fear of spreading the diseases. Outside they should avoid other people and always carry a white stick to warn of their occupation. Searchers reported to the Parish Clerk, who made a return each week to the Company of Parish Clerks in Brode Lane. Figures were then passed to the Lord Mayor and then to the Minister of State once plague became a matter of national concern.<ref name=Bell10>Bell folio ed., p.&nbsp;10\u201311</ref> The reported figures were used to compile the [[Bills of Mortality]], which listed total deaths in each parish and whether by plague. The system of Searchers to report the cause of death continued until 1836.<ref name=Bellf12 />\n\nGraunt recorded the incompetence of the Searchers at identifying true causes of death, remarking on the frequent recording of 'consumption' rather than other diseases which were recognised then by physicians. He suggested a cup of ale and a doubling of their fee to two groats rather than one was sufficient for Searchers to change the cause of death to one  more convenient for the householders. No one wished to be known as having had a death by plague in their household, and Parish Clerks, too, connived in covering up cases of plague in their official returns. Analysis of the Bills of Mortality during the months plague took hold shows a rise in deaths other than by plague well above the average death rate, which has been attributed to misrepresentation of the true cause of death.<ref name=Bellf12>Bell, Folio ed., p.12</ref> As plague spread, a system of [[quarantine]] was introduced, whereby any house where someone had died from plague would be locked up and no one allowed to enter or leave for 40 days. This frequently led to the deaths of the other inhabitants, by neglect if not from plague, and provided ample incentive not to report the disease. The official returns record 68,596 cases of plague, but a reasonable estimate suggests this figure is 30,000 short of the true total.<ref name=\"Bell Folio ed p 13\">Bell, Folio ed. p.13</ref> A plague house was marked with a red cross on the door with the words \"Lord have mercy upon us\", and a [[Watchman (law enforcement)|watchman]] stood guard outside.<ref name=Leasor27/>\n\n==Preventive measures==\n\nReports of plague around Europe began to reach England in the 1660s, causing the Privy Council to  consider what steps might be taken to prevent it crossing to England. Quarantining of ships had been used during previous outbreaks and was again introduced for ships coming to London in November 1663, following outbreaks in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Hamburg]].  Two naval ships were assigned to intercept any vessels entering the Thames estuary. Ships from infected ports were  required to moor at Hole Haven on [[Canvey Island]] for a period of 30 days before being allowed to travel upriver. Ships from ports free of plague or completing their quarantine were given a certificate of health and allowed to travel on.  A second inspection line was established  between the forts on opposite banks of the Thames at [[Tilbury]] and [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] with instructions only to pass ships with a certificate.<ref>Porter 1999, p.116</ref>\n\nThe duration of quarantine was increased to forty days in May 1664 as the continental plague worsened, and the areas subject to quarantine changed with the news of the spread of plague to include all of [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]] and [[Lordship of Frisia|Friesland]] (all regions of the [[Dutch Republic]]), although restrictions on Hamburg were removed in November. Quarantine measures against ships coming from the Dutch Republic were put in place in 29 other ports from May, commencing with [[Great Yarmouth]]. The Dutch ambassador objected at the constraint of trade with his country, but England responded that it had been one of the last countries introducing such restrictions. Regulations were enforced quite strictly, so that people or houses where voyagers had come ashore without serving their quarantine were also subjected to 40 days quarantine.<ref>Porter 1999, p.&nbsp;117\u2013119</ref>\n\n==Outbreak==\n{{Main|Plague of Justinian|Black Death|Third plague pandemic}}\nPlague was one of the hazards of life in Britain from its dramatic appearance in 1348 with the Black Death. The Bills of Mortality began to be published regularly in 1603, in which year 33,347 deaths were recorded from plague. Between then and 1665, only four years had no recorded cases. In 1563, a thousand people were reportedly dying in London each week. In 1593, there were 15,003 deaths, 1625 saw 41,313 dead, between 1640 and 1646 came 11,000 deaths, culminating  in 3,597 for 1647. The 1625 outbreak was recorded at the time as the 'Great Plague', Until 1665, surpassed it. These official figures are likely to under-report actual numbers.<ref>Bell, Folio ed., p.&nbsp;3\u20135</ref>\n\n===Early days===\n[[File:Rattus norvegicus 1.jpg|thumb|right|''Rattus rattus'', the Black Rat. Smaller than the Norwegian rat, which later supplanted it, it is also keener to live near to humankind. Timber houses and overcrowded slums provided great homes. The link between the rat as reservoir of infection and host to fleas which could transfer to man was not understood. Efforts were made to eliminate cats and dogs but not rats. If anything, this encouraged the rats.]]\nAlthough plague was known, it was still sufficiently uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic.<ref>Bell, Folio ed. p.10</ref> Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, some of which were fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, and it may be that the cold weather held back its spread.<ref>Bell, Folio ed., pp. 7,8</ref>\n\nThis outbreak of bubonic plague in England is thought to have spread from the [[Netherlands]], where the disease had been occurring intermittently since 1599. It is unclear exactly where the disease first struck but the initial contagion may have arrived with Dutch trading ships carrying bales of [[cotton]] from [[Amsterdam]], which was ravaged by the disease in 1663\u20131664, with a mortality given of 50,000.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Appleby, Andrew B. |year=1980 |title=The Disappearance of Plague: A Continuing Puzzle |journal=The Economic History Review |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=161\u2013173 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1980.tb01821.x }}</ref> The first areas to be struck  are believed to be the [[Dock (maritime)|dock]] areas just outside London, and the parish of [[St Giles in the Fields]]. In both of these localities, poor workers were crowded into ill-kept structures. Two suspicious deaths were recorded in St. Giles [[parish]] in 1664 and another in February 1665. These did not appear as plague deaths on the [[Bills of Mortality]], so no control measures were taken by the authorities, but the total number of people dying in London during the first four months of 1665 showed a marked increase. By the end of April, only four plague deaths had been recorded, two in the parish of St. Giles, but total deaths per week had risen from around 290 to 398.<ref name=Leasor50>Leasor (1962) pp. 46\u201350</ref>\n\nAlthough there had been only three official cases in April, which level of plague in earlier years had not induced any official response, the Privy Council now acted to introduce household quarantine. Justices of the Peace in Middlesex were instructed to investigate any suspected cases  and to shut up the house if it was confirmed. Shortly after, a similar order was issued by the King's Bench to the City and Liberties. A riot broke out in St. Giles when the first house was sealed up; the crowd broke down the door and released the inhabitants. Rioters caught were punished severely. Instructions were given to build pest-houses, which were essentially isolation hospitals built away from other people where the sick could be cared for (or stay until they died). This official activity suggests that despite the few recorded cases, the government was already aware that this was a serious outbreak of plague.<ref>Bell, Folio ed., p.14,15</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of warmer weather, the disease began to take a firmer hold. In the week 2\u20139 May, there were three recorded deaths in the parish of St Giles, four in neighbouring [[St Clement Danes]] and one each in [[St Andrew, Holborn]] and [[St Mary Woolchurch Haw]].<ref name=\"Bell Folio ed p 13\"/> Only the last was actually inside the city walls. A Privy Council committee was formed to investigate methods to best prevent the spread of plague, and measures were introduced to close some of the ale houses in affected areas and limit the number of lodgers allowed in a household. In the city, the Lord Mayor issued a proclamation that all householders must diligently clean the streets outside their property, which was a householder's responsibility, not a state one (the city employed scavengers and rakers to remove the worst of the mess). Matters just became worse, and Aldermen were instructed to find and punish those failing their duty.<ref>Bell, Folio ed., p. 16</ref> As cases in St. Giles began to rise, an attempt  was made to quarantine the area and constables were instructed to inspect everyone wishing to travel and  contain inside vagrants or suspect persons.<ref>Bell, Folio ed., p. 17</ref>\n\nPeople began to be alarmed. [[Samuel Pepys]], who had an important position at the [[Admiralty]], stayed in London and provided a contemporary account of the plague through his diary.<ref name=Leasor62>Leasor (1962) pp. 60\u201362</ref> On 30 April he wrote: \"Great fears of the sickness here in the City it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God preserve us all!\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Pepys |first=Samuel |chapter=April 30th |chapterurl=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Diary_of_Samuel_Pepys/1665/April#April_30th |title=Diary of Samuel Pepys |year=1665 |isbn=0-520-22167-2}}</ref> Another source of information on the time is a fictional account, ''[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]'', which was  written by [[Daniel Defoe]] and published in 1722. He had been only six when the plague struck but made use of his family's recollections (his uncle was a saddler in East London and his father a butcher in [[Cripplegate]]), interviews with survivors and sight of such official records as were available.<ref name=Leasor47>Leasor (1962) pp. 47, 62</ref>\n\n===Exodus from the city===\nBy July 1665, plague was rampant in the City of London. The rich ran away including King [[Charles II of England]], his family and his court left the city for [[Salisbury]], moving on to [[Oxford]]  in September when some cases of plague occurred in Salisbury.<ref name=Leasor103>Leasor (1962) p. 103</ref> The [[aldermen]] and most of the other city authorities opted to stay at their posts. The [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor of London]], [[John Lawrence (Lord Mayor)|Sir John Lawrence]], also decided to stay in the city. Businesses were closed when merchants and professionals fled. Defoe wrote \"Nothing was to be seen but wagons and carts, with goods, women, servants, children, coaches filled with people of the better sort, and horsemen attending them, and all hurrying away\".<ref name=Leasor62/> As the plague raged throughout the summer, only a small number of [[clergymen]], [[physician]]s and [[apothecaries]] remained to cope with an increasingly large number of victims. Edward Cotes, author of ''London's Dreadful Visitation'', expressed the hope that \"Neither the Physicians of our Souls or Bodies may hereafter in such great numbers forsake us\".<ref name=Leasor62/>\n\nThe poorer people were also alarmed by the contagion and some left the city, but it was not easy for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required to possess a certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and thirst in the hot summer that was to follow.<ref name=Leasor69>Leasor (1962) pp. 66\u201369</ref>\n\n===Height of the epidemic===\n[[File:Bill of Mortality.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A ''bill of mortality'' for the plague in 1665]]\nIn the last week of July, the London Bill of Mortality showed 3,014 deaths, of which 2,020 had died from the plague. The number of deaths as a result of plague may have been underestimated, as deaths in other years in the same period were much lower, at around 300. As the number of victims affected mounted up, burial grounds became overfull, and pits were dug to accommodate the dead. Drivers of dead-carts travelled the streets calling \"Bring out your dead\" and carted away piles of bodies. The authorities became concerned that the number of deaths might cause public alarm and ordered that body removal and interment should take place only at night.<ref name=Leasor145>Leasor (1962) pp. 141\u2013145</ref> As time went on, there were too many victims, and too few drivers, to remove the bodies which began to be stacked up against the walls of houses. Daytime collection was resumed and the plague pits became mounds of decomposing corpses. In the parish of Aldgate, a great hole was dug near the churchyard, fifty feet long and twenty feet wide. Digging was continued by labourers at one end while the dead-carts tipped in corpses at the other. When there was no room for further extension it was dug deeper until ground water was reached at twenty feet. When finally covered with earth it housed 1,114 corpses.<ref name=Leasor175>Leasor (1962) pp. 174\u2013175</ref>\n\n[[Plague doctor]]s traversed the streets diagnosing victims, although many of them had no formal medical training. Several [[public health]] efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats.<ref>Moote, Lloyd and Dorothy: ''The Great Plague: the Story of London's most Deadly Year'', Baltimore, 2004. p. 115.</ref> This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed.<ref name=Leasor169>Leasor (1962) pp. 166\u2013169</ref> Tobacco was thought to be a [[Prophylaxis#Prophylaxis|prophylactic]] and it was later said that no London [[tobacconist]] had died from the plague during the epidemic.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Great Plague |last=Porter |first=Stephen |year=2009 |publisher=Amberley Publishing |isbn=978-1-84868-087-6 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2EBkPNnUXEC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=%22Great%20Plague%22%20tobacco }}</ref>\n\nTrade and business had completely dried up, and the streets were empty of people except for the dead-carts and the desperate dying victims, as witnessed and recorded by Samuel Pepys in his diary: \" Lord! How empty the streets are and how melancholy, so many poor sick people in the streets full of sores\u2026 in Westminster, there is never a physician and but one apothecary left, all being dead.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Concise Pepys|last=Pepys|first=Samuel|publisher=Wordsworth Editions Ltd|year=1996|isbn=978-1853264788|location=|pages=363, 16 September 1665|quote=|via=}}</ref> That people did not starve was down to the foresight of Sir John Lawrence and the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] who arranged for a commission of one [[Farthing (English coin)|farthing]] to be paid above the normal price for every quarter of corn landed in the Port of London.<ref name=Leasor101>Leasor (1962) pp. 99\u2013101</ref> Another food source was the villages around London which, denied of their usual sales in the capital, left vegetables in specified market areas, negotiated their sale by shouting, and collected their payment after the money had been left submerged in a bucket of water to \"disinfect\" the coins.<ref name=Leasor101>Leasor (1962) pp. 99\u2013101</ref>\n\nRecords state that plague deaths in London and the suburbs crept up over the summer from 2,000 people per week to over 7,000 per week in September. These figures are likely to be a considerable underestimate. Many of the sextons and parish clerks who kept the records themselves died. [[Quakers]] refused to co-operate and many of the poor were just dumped into mass graves unrecorded. It is not clear how many people caught the disease and made a recovery because only deaths were recorded and many records were destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] the following year. In the few districts where intact records remain, plague deaths varied between 30% and over 50% of the total population.<ref name=Leasor156>Leasor (1962) pp. 155\u2013156</ref>\n\nAlthough concentrated in London, the outbreak affected other areas of the country as well. Perhaps the most famous example was the village of [[Eyam]] in [[Derbyshire]]. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a parcel of cloth sent from London, although this is a disputed point. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas but the cost to the village was the death of around 80% of its inhabitants over a period of fourteen months.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coleman, Michel P. |year=1986 |title=A Plague Epidemic in Voluntary Quarantine |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=379\u2013385 |doi=10.1093/ije/15.3.379 }}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|Great Fire of London}}\nBy late autumn, the death toll in London and the suburbs began to slow until, in February 1666, it was considered safe enough for the King and his entourage to come back to the city. With the return of the monarch, others began to return: The gentry returned in their carriages accompanied by carts piled high with their belongings. The judges moved back from [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] to sit in [[Westminster Hall]], although [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], which had been [[Legislative session|prorogued]] in April 1665, did not reconvene until September 1666. Trade recommenced and businesses and workshops opened up. London was the goal of a new wave of people who flocked to the city in expectation of making their fortunes. Writing at the end of March 1666, [[Lord Clarendon]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], stated \"...&nbsp;the streets were as full, the Exchange as much crowded, the people in all places as numerous as they had ever been seen&nbsp;...\".<ref name=Leasor196>Leasor (1962) pp. 193\u2013196</ref>\n\nPlague cases continued to occur sporadically at a modest rate until the summer of 1666. On the second and third of September that year, the [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed much of the City of London, and some people believed that the fire put an end to the epidemic. However, it is now thought that the plague had largely subsided before the fire took place. In fact, most of the later cases of plague were found in the suburbs,<ref name=Leasor196/> and it was the City of London itself that was destroyed by the Fire.<ref name=Leasor251>Leasor (1962) pp. 250\u2013251</ref>\n\nAccording to the Bills of Mortality, there were in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon estimated that the true number of mortalities was probably twice that figure. The next year, 1666, saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. [[Thomas Gumble|Dr Thomas Gumble]], chaplain to the [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|Duke of Albemarle]], both of whom had stayed in London for the whole of the epidemic, estimated that the total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000.<ref name=\"Leasor196\"/>\n\nThe Great Plague of 1665/1666 was the last major outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in Great Britain. The last recorded death from plague came in 1679, and it was removed as a specific category in the Bills of Mortality after 1703. It spread to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten percent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years. Urban areas were more affected than rural ones; Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Southampton and Winchester were badly affected, while the West of England and areas of the Midlands escaped altogether.<ref>Porter 1999, p.155</ref>\n\nThe population of England in 1650 was approximately 5.25 million, which declined  to about 4.9 million by 1680, recovering to just over 5 million by 1700. Other diseases, such as smallpox, took a high toll on the population even without the contribution by plague. The higher death rate in cities, both generally and specifically from the plague, was made up by continuous immigration, from small towns to larger ones and from the countryside to the town.<ref>Porter 1999, p.154</ref>\n\nThere were no contemporary censuses of London's population, but available records suggest that the population returned to its previous level within a couple of years.  Burials in 1667 had returned to 1663 levels, Hearth Tax returns had recovered, John Graunt contemporarily analysed baptism records and concluded they represented a recovered population. Part of this could be accounted for by the return of wealthy households, merchants and manufacturing industries, all of which needed to replace losses among their staff and took steps to bring in necessary people. Colchester had suffered  more severe depopulation, but manufacturing records for cloth suggested that production had recovered or even increased by 1669, and the total population had nearly returned to pre-plague levels by 1674. Other towns did less well: Ipswich was affected less than Colchester, but in 1674, its population had dropped by 18%, more than could be accounted for by the plague deaths alone.<ref>Porter 1999, p.&nbsp;148\u2013150</ref>{{dubious|date=July 2018}}\n\nAs a proportion of the population who died, the London death toll was less severe than in a number of other towns. The total of deaths in London was greater than in any previous outbreak for 100 years, though as a proportion of the population, the epidemics in 1563, 1603 and 1625 were comparable or greater.

It is the result of processed user input and usually the main interface for human-machine interaction. The [[touch user interface]]s popular on small mobile devices are an overlay of the visual output to the visual input.]]\n\nDesigning the visual composition and temporal behavior of a GUI is an important part of [[software application]] programming in the area of [[human\u2013computer interaction]]. Its goal is to enhance the efficiency and ease of use for the underlying logical design of a stored [[computer program|program]], a design discipline named ''[[usability]]''. Methods of [[user-centered design]] are used to ensure that the visual language introduced in the design is well-tailored to the tasks.\n\nThe visible graphical interface features of an application are sometimes referred to as ''chrome'' or ''GUI'' (pronounced ''gooey'').<ref>[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/chrome.html ''The Jargon Book'', \"Chrome\"]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/ui-chrome.html |title=Browser and GUI Chrome |author=Jakob Nielsen}}</ref> Typically, users interact with information by manipulating visual [[GUI widget|widgets]] that allow for interactions appropriate to the kind of data they hold. The widgets of a well-designed interface are selected to support the actions necessary to achieve the goals of users. A [[model\u2013view\u2013controller]] allows flexible structures in which the interface is independent from and indirectly linked to application functions, so the GUI can be customized easily. This allows users to select or design a different ''[[skin (computing)|skin]]'' at will, and eases the designer's work to change the interface as user needs evolve. Good user interface design relates to users more, and to system architecture less.\n\nLarge widgets, such as [[Window (computing)|windows]], usually provide a frame or container for the main presentation content such as a web page, email message or drawing. Smaller ones usually act as a user-input tool.\n\nA GUI may be designed for the requirements of a [[vertical market]] as application-specific graphical user interfaces. Examples include [[automated teller machine]]s (ATM), [[point of sale]] (POS) touchscreens at restaurants,<ref>[http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv2n6/gettingdowntobusiness.html The ViewTouch restaurant system] by Giselle Bisson</ref> [[Self checkout|self-service checkouts]] used in a retail store, airline self-ticketing and check-in, information kiosks in a public space, like a train station or a museum, and monitors or control screens in an embedded industrial application which employ a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS).\n\nBy the 1980s, cell phones and handheld game systems also employed application specific touchscreen GUIs. Newer automobiles use GUIs in their navigation systems and multimedia centers, or navigation multimedia center combinations.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n<gallery width=\"180px\" height=\"120\" caption=\"Sample graphical desktop environments\">\nFile:Shows Overview mode (\"Activities\") in GNOME 3.8.png|[[GNOME Shell]] (''Gnome\u20113'')\nFile:KDE Plasma 5.png|[[KDE Plasma 5]]\nFile:Ubuntu 13.04 Desktop.png|[[Unity (user interface)|Unity]]\nFile:MATE 1.10.png|[[MATE (software)|MATE]]\nFile:Wayland demo 2.png|Windows on a [[Wayland (display server protocol)#Wayland compositors|Wayland compositor]]\nFile:XFCE-4.10-Desktop.png|[[Xfce]]\nFile:E17 bw screenshot.png|[[Enlightenment (software)|Enlightenment]]\nFile:Sugar-home-view-0.82.jpg|[[Sugar (software)|Sugar]]\nFile:X-Window-System.png|A [[twm]] [[X Window System]] environment\nFile:Dwm-shot.png|The [[dwm]] [[tiling window manager]]\nFile:Mint 18 cinnamon.png|[[Cinnamon (software)|Cinnamon]]\nFile:WikiDesktop008.png|\"Wikipedia-themed\" GUI\n</gallery>\n\n== Components ==\n\n[[File:Schema of the layers of the graphical user interface.svg|thumb|300px|Layers of a GUI based on a [[windowing system]]]]\n{{Main article|Elements of graphical user interfaces}}\n{{further information|WIMP (computing)|Window manager|Desktop environment}}\nA GUI uses a combination of technologies and devices to provide a platform that users can interact with, for the tasks of gathering and producing information.\n\nA series of elements conforming a [[visual language]] have evolved to represent information stored in computers. This makes it easier for people with few computer skills to work with and use computer software. The most common combination of such elements in GUIs is the ''windows, icons, menus, pointer'' ([[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]]) paradigm, especially in [[personal computer]]s.\n\nThe WIMP style of interaction uses a virtual [[input device]] to represent the position of a [[pointing device]], most often a [[computer mouse|mouse]], and presents information organized in windows and represented with icons. Available commands are compiled together in menus, and actions are performed making gestures with the pointing device. A [[window manager]] facilitates the interactions between windows, applications, and the [[windowing system]]. The windowing system handles hardware devices such as pointing devices, graphics hardware, and positioning of the pointer.\n\nIn [[personal computer]]s, all these elements are modeled through a [[desktop metaphor]] to produce a simulation called a [[desktop environment]] in which the display represents a desktop, on which documents and folders of documents can be placed. Window managers and other software combine to simulate the desktop environment with varying degrees of realism.\n\n== Post-WIMP interface ==\n\n{{Main article|Post-WIMP}}\nSmaller mobile devices such as [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs) and [[smartphone]]s typically use the WIMP elements with different unifying metaphors, due to constraints in space and available input devices. Applications for which WIMP is not well suited may use newer [[interaction technique]]s, collectively termed ''[[post-WIMP]]'' user interfaces.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/38/17635/00814559.pdf?isnumber=17635&prod=JNL&arnumber=814559&arSt=50&ared=51&arAuthor=van+Dam%2C+A IEEE.org.]</ref>\n\nAs of 2011, some touchscreen-based operating systems such as Apple's [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]) and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] use the class of GUIs named post-WIMP. These support styles of interaction using more than one finger in contact with a display, which allows actions such as pinching and rotating, which are unsupported by one pointer and mouse.<ref>[http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/papers/chi08.pdf Reality-Based Interaction: A Framework for Post-WIMP Interfaces]</ref>\n\n== Interaction ==\n\n[[Human interface device]]s, for the efficient interaction with a GUI include a [[computer keyboard]], especially used together with [[keyboard shortcut]]s, [[pointing device]]s for the [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] (or rather [[Pointer (user interface)|pointer]]) control: [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], [[pointing stick]], [[touchpad]], [[trackball]], [[joystick]], [[virtual keyboard]]s, and [[head-up display]]s (translucent information devices at the eye level).\n\nThere are also actions performed by programs that affect the GUI. For example, there are components like [[inotify]] or [[D-Bus]] to facilitate communication between computer programs.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|History of the graphical user interface}}\n\n=== Early efforts ===\n[[Ivan Sutherland]] developed [[Sketchpad]] in 1963, widely held as the first graphical [[computer-aided design]] program. It used a [[light pen]] to create and manipulate objects in engineering drawings in realtime with coordinated graphics. In the late 1960s, researchers at the [[Stanford Research Institute]], led by [[Douglas Engelbart]], developed the [[On-Line System]] (NLS), which used text-based [[hyperlink]]s manipulated with a then new device: the [[Computer mouse|mouse]]. In the 1970s, Engelbart's ideas were further refined and extended to graphics by researchers at [[Xerox PARC]] and specifically [[Alan Kay]], who went beyond text-based hyperlinks and used a GUI as the main interface for the [[Xerox Alto]] [[computer]], released in 1973. Most modern general-purpose GUIs are derived from this system.[[File:Xerox Star 8010 workstations.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Xerox Star 8010]] workstation introduced the first commercial GUI.]]\n\nThe Xerox PARC user interface consisted of graphical elements such as [[Window (computing)|windows]], [[menu (computing)|menus]], [[radio button (computing)|radio buttons]], and [[check box]]es. The concept of [[Icon (computing)|icons]] was later introduced by [[David Canfield Smith]], who had written a thesis on the subject under the guidance of Kay.<ref name=\"MIT\">Lieberman, Henry.

These aspects can be emphasized by using the alternative term and acronym for ''windows, icons, menus, [[pointing device]]'' ([[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]]). This effort culminated in the 1973 [[Xerox Alto]], the first computer with a GUI, though the system never reached commercial production.\n\nThe first commercially available computer with a GUI was the 1979 [[PERQ|PERQ workstation]], manufactured by Three Rivers Computer Corporation. In 1981, Xerox eventually commercialized the Alto in the form of a new and enhanced system \u2013 the Xerox 8010 Information System \u2013 more commonly known as the [[Xerox Star]].<ref>[http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taouu/html/ch02s05.html The first GUIs<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn4vC80Pv6Q Xerox Star user interface demonstration, 1982]</ref> These early systems spurred many other GUI efforts, including Lisp machines by [[Symbolics]] and other manufacturers, the [[Apple Lisa]] (which presented the concept of [[menu bar]] and [[Window manager|window controls]]) in 1983, the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh 128K]] in 1984, and the [[Atari ST]] with [[Digital Research]]'s [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]], and Commodore [[Amiga]] in 1985.

This allows greater efficiency and productivity once many commands are learned,<ref name=\"computerhope.com\" /><ref name=\"blogs.technet.com\" /><ref name=\"blogs.technet.com 2\" /> but reaching this level takes some time because the command words may not be easily discoverable or [[mnemonic]]. Also, using the command line can become slow and error-prone when users must enter long commands comprising many parameters or several different filenames at once. However, ''windows, icons, menus, pointer'' ([[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]]) interfaces present users with many [[GUI widget|widgets]] that represent and can trigger some of the system's available commands.\n\nGUIs can be made quite hard when dialogs are buried deep in a system, or moved about to different places during redesigns. Also, icons and dialog boxes are usually harder for users to script.\n\nWIMPs extensively use [[mode (computer interface)|modes]], as the meaning of all keys and clicks on specific positions on the screen are redefined all the time. Command line interfaces use modes only in limited forms, such as for current directory and environment variables.\n\nMost modern [[operating system]]s provide both a GUI and some level of a CLI, although the GUIs usually receive more attention. The GUI is usually WIMP-based, although occasionally other metaphors surface, such as those used in [[Microsoft Bob]], 3dwm, or [[File System Visualizer]].\n\n=== GUI wrappers ===\nGraphical user interface (GUI) wrappers circumvent the [[command-line interface]] versions (CLI) of (typically) [[Linux]] and [[Unix-like]] software applications and their [[text-based user interface]]s or typed command labels. While command-line or text-based application allow users to run a program non-interactively, GUI wrappers atop them avoid the steep [[learning curve]] of the command-line, which requires commands to be typed on the [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]. By starting a GUI wrapper, [[User (computing)|users]] can intuitively [[Human\u2013computer interaction|interact]] with, start, stop, and change its working parameters, through graphical [[Icon (computing)|icons]] and visual indicators of a [[desktop environment]], for example.\nApplications may also provide both interfaces, and when they do the GUI is usually a WIMP wrapper around the command-line version. This is especially common with applications designed for [[Unix-like]] operating systems. The latter used to be implemented first because it allowed the developers to focus exclusively on their product's functionality without bothering about interface details such as designing icons and placing buttons. Designing programs this way also allows users to run the program in a [[shell script]].\n\n== Three-dimensional user interfaces ==\n{{About|3D user interfaces as software|physical 3D input/output devices|3D interaction#3D user interfaces|section=yes}}\nFor typical computer displays, ''three-dimensional'' is a misnomer\u2014their displays are two-dimensional. Semantically, however, most graphical user interfaces use three dimensions. With height and width, they offer a third dimension of layering or stacking screen elements over one another. This may be represented visually on screen through an illusionary transparent effect, which offers the advantage that information in background windows may still be read, if not interacted with. Or the environment may simply hide the background information, possibly making the distinction apparent by drawing a [[drop shadow]] effect over it.\n\nSome environments use the methods of [[3D graphics]] to project virtual three dimensional user interface objects onto the screen. These are often shown in use in [[science fiction film]]s (see below for examples). As the processing power of computer graphics hardware increases, this becomes less of an obstacle to a smooth user experience.\n\nThree-dimensional graphics are currently mostly used in computer games, art, and [[computer-aided design]] (CAD). A three-dimensional computing environment can also be useful in other uses, like [[molecular graphics]], [[Aircraft design process|aircraft design]] and [[Non-random two-liquid model|Phase Equilibrium Calculations/Design of unit operations and chemical processes]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Graphical User Interface|first1=(GUI)|title=Topological Analysis of the Gibbs Energy Function (Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium Correlation Data.

For example, user switching is represented by rotating a cube which faces are each user's workspace, and window management is represented via a [[Rolodex]]-style flipping mechanism in [[Windows Vista]] (see [[Windows Flip 3D]]). In both cases, the operating system transforms windows on-the-fly while continuing to update the content of those windows.\n\nInterfaces for the [[X Window System]] have also implemented advanced three-dimensional user interfaces through [[compositing window manager]]s such as [[Beryl (window manager)|Beryl]], [[Compiz]] and [[KWin]] using the [[AIGLX]] or [[XGL]] architectures, allowing use of OpenGL to animate user interactions with the desktop.\n\nAnother branch in the three-dimensional desktop environment is the three-dimensional GUIs that take the desktop metaphor a step further, like the [[BumpTop]], where users can manipulate documents and windows as if they were physical documents, with realistic movement and physics.\n\nThe [[zooming user interface]] (ZUI) is a related technology that promises to deliver the representation benefits of 3D environments without their usability drawbacks of orientation problems and hidden objects. It is a logical advance on the GUI, blending some [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] movement with [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] or ''[[2.5D]]'' vector objects. In 2006, [[Hillcrest Labs]] introduced the first zooming user interface for television,<ref name=\"Moren\">''Macworld.com'' November 11, 2006. Dan Moren.

For example; the 1993 American film ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' features [[Silicon Graphics]]' three-dimensional file manager [[File System Navigator]], a real-life file manager for Unix operating systems. The film [[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]] has scenes of police officers using specialized 3d data systems. In prose fiction, three-dimensional user interfaces have been portrayed as immersible environments like [[William Gibson]]'s [[Cyberspace]] or [[Neal Stephenson]]'s [[Metaverse]]. Many futuristic imaginings of user interfaces rely heavily on [[object-oriented user interface]] (OOUI) style and especially object-oriented graphical user interface (OOGUI) style.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dayton|first=Tom|title=Object-Oriented GUIs are the Future|url=http://openmct.blogspot.com/2012/08/object-oriented-guis-are-future.html|work=OpenMCT Blog|accessdate=23 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810170239/http://openmct.blogspot.com/2012/08/object-oriented-guis-are-future.html|archivedate=10 August 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Computer Science|Information technology}}\n{{div col |colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[Apple Computer, Inc. v.

In species that produce two [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a [[female]] is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete\u2014called an [[ovum]] (or egg)\u2014and a [[male]] produces the smaller [[tadpole]]-like type\u2014called a [[sperm]]. In short a gamete is an egg (female gamete) or a sperm (male gamete). This is an example of [[anisogamy]] or [[heterogamy]], the condition in which females and males produce gametes of different sizes (this is the case in humans; the human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell<ref>[[Arthur Milnes Marshall|Marshall, A. M.]] 1893. ''Vertebrate embryology: a text-book for students and practitioners''. GP Putnam's Sons.</ref><ref>Yeung, C., M. Anapolski, M. Depenbusch, M. Zitzmann, and T. Cooper. 2003. \"Human sperm volume regulation. Response to physiological changes in osmolality, channel blockers and potential sperm osmolytes.\" ''Human Reproduction'' 18:1029.</ref>). In contrast, [[isogamy]] is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape, and given arbitrary designators for [[mating type]]. The name gamete was introduced by the [[Austria]]n biologist [[Gregor Mendel]]. Gametes carry half the [[genetic information]] of an individual, one [[ploidy]] of each type, and are created through [[meiosis]].\n\n[[Oogenesis]] is the process of female gamete formation in animals. This process involves [[meiosis]] (including [[genetic recombination|meiotic recombination]]) occurring in the diploid primary [[oocyte]] to produce the haploid [[Egg cell|ovum]] (gamete).  [[Spermatogenesis]] is the process of male gamete formation in animals.  This process also involves meiosis (including meiotic recombination) occurring in the diploid primary [[spermatocyte]] to produce the haploid [[spermatozoon]] (gamete).\n\n==Dissimilarity==\nIn contrast to a gamete, the diploid [[somatic cell]]s of an individual contain one copy of the chromosome set from the sperm and one copy of the chromosome set from the egg cell; that is, the cells of the offspring have genes expressing characteristics of both the ''father'' and the ''mother''. A gamete's chromosomes are not exact duplicates of either of the sets of chromosomes carried in the diploid chromosomes, and often undergo random mutations resulting in modified DNA (and subsequently, new proteins and [[phenotypes]]).\n\n==Sex determination in humans and birds==\nIn [[human]]s, a normal ovum can carry only an [[X chromosome]] (of the X and [[Y chromosomes]]), whereas a sperm may carry either an X or a Y (a non-normal ovum can end up carrying two or no X chromosomes, as a result of an irregularity at either of the two stages of meiosis, while a non-normal sperm cell can end up carrying either no sex-defining chromosomes, an XY pair, or XX pair as a result of the forementioned reason); ergo the male sperm can play a role in determining the [[sex]] of any resulting [[zygote]], if the zygote has two X chromosomes it may develop into a female, if it has an X and a Y chromosome, it may develop into a male.<ref name=\"Phelan2009\">{{cite book|author=Jay Phelan|title=What Is Life?: A Guide to Biology W/Prep-U|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4okAxTXPtIC&pg=PA237|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=30 April 2009|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4292-2318-8|pages=237\u2013}}</ref> For birds, the female ovum determines the sex of the offspring, through the [[ZW sex-determination system]].<ref name=\"Phelan2009\"/>\n\n==Artificial gametes==\nArtificial gametes, also known as In vitro derived gametes (IVD), stem cell-derived gametes (SCDGs), and In vitro generated gametes (IVG), are gametes derived from [[stem cells]].

The female haploid is called the [[ovule]] and is produced by the [[Ovary (botany)|ovary]] of the flower.  When mature the haploid ovule produces the female gamete which are ready for fertilization. The male haploid is [[pollen]] and is produced by the [[anther]], when pollen lands on a mature [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] of a flower it grows a [[pollen tube]] down into the flower. The haploid pollen then produces sperm by mitosis and releases them for fertilization.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Reproductive physiology}}\n\n[[Category:Classical genetics]]\n[[Category:Germ cells]]\n[[Category:Reproductive system]]", "sha1": "cbgwejpwwhz5xjzdbbseiia4uxsuxwj"}}, {"title": "List of German proverbs", "ns": "0", "id": "12296", "revision": {"id": "823964248", "parentid": "574007736", "timestamp": "2018-02-04T14:28:33Z", "contributor": {"username": "Colonies Chris", "id": "577301"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Wikiquote redirect|German proverbs|many=yes}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of phrases|German proverbs]]\n[[Category:Germany-related lists|Proverbs]]\n\n{{Short pages monitor}}<!-- This long comment was added to the page to prevent it from being listed on Special:Shortpages.

Martin persuaded Guthridge (who confesses that at that time he despised [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]) not only to give [[speculative fiction]] a second look, but to write in the field himself. (Guthridge has since been a finalist for the Hugo Award and twice for the [[Nebula Award]] for science fiction and fantasy.

He resigned from his job, and being tired of the hard winters in Dubuque, he moved to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/george-r-r-martin-interview|title=George R.R.

His first sale was \"The Hero\", sold to ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed.

In 1975 his story \"...for a single yesterday\" about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in ''[[Epoch (anthology)|Epoch]]'', a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, ''[[Dying of the Light]]'', was completed in 1976 right before he moved to Dubuque and published in 1977. That same year the enormous success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' had a huge impact on the publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold the novel for the same amount he would make in three years of teaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/george-r-r-martin-the-complete-rolling-stone-interview-20140613|title=George R.R.

The need for a day job occurred simultaneously with the American chess craze which followed [[Bobby Fischer]]'s victory in the 1972 world chess championship. Martin's own chess skills and experience allowed him to be hired as a tournament director for the Continental Chess Association that ran chess tournaments in the weekends. This gave him a sufficient income, and because the tournaments only ran on Saturdays and Sundays, it allowed him to work as a writer five days a week from 1973 to 1976. When the chess bubble subsequently burst and no longer provided an income, he had become much better established as a writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/song-of-ice-and-fire-author-george-rr-martin-on-success-chess-and-the-wrath-of-superfans-9652448.html|title=George RR Martin on success, chess and the wrath of superfans|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgerrmartin.com/life/|title=Life & Times of George R.R.

Martin considered ''[[Sandkings (novelette)|Sandkings]]'' (1979) the best known of these. Another one was the novella ''[[Nightflyers]]'' (1980), whose screen and television rights was purchased by Vista in 1984, and released as a movie in 1987,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://grrm.livejournal.com/555986.html|title=The NIGHTFLYER Flies Again|first=|last=grrm|date=November 27, 2017|website=livejournal.com}}</ref> although he was unhappy about having to cut plot elements for the screenplay's scenario in order to accommodate the film's small budget.<ref name=\"NPR2012\">{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/15/161142894/thrones-author-george-r-r-martin-plays-not-my-job?ps=view&ec=mostpopular | title='Thrones' Author George R.R.

Unlike traditional vampire novels, in ''Fevre Dream'' vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D'Amassa has praised ''Fevre Dream'' for its strong 19th century atmosphere and wrote: \"This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time\".<ref name=\"D'Amassa pages 388-390\">D'Amassa, Don \"Martin, George\" pages 388-390 from ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers'' edited by David Pringle, Detroit: St. James Press, 1997 page 390.</ref> Martin followed up ''Fevre Dream'' with another horror novel, ''The Armageddon Rag''. The unexpected commercial failure of ''[[The Armageddon Rag]]'' (1983), \"essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time\", he recalled. In 1984 the new editor of Baen Books, Betsy Mitchell, called Martin to ask him if he had considered doing a collection of Haviland Tuf adventures. Martin, which had several favorite series characters like [[Solomon Kane]], [[Elric]], [[Nicholas van Rijn]] and [[Magnus Ridolph]], had made an attempt to create such a character on his own in the 1970s with his Tuf stories. He was interested, but was too occupied with the writing of his next book, the never completed novel ''Black and White and Red All Over'', which occupied most of his writing time the same year. But after the failure of ''The Armageddon Rag'', all editors rejected his upcoming novel, and being desperate for money, he accepted Mitchell's offer and wrote some more Tuf stories which were collected in ''[[Tuf Voyaging]]'', which sold well enough for Mitchell to suggest a sequel. Martin was willing and agreed to do it, but before he got started he got an offer from Hollywood, where producer Philip DeGuere Jr. wanted to adapt ''The Armageddon Rag'' into a movie. The movie never happened, but they stayed in touch, and when he became the producer for the revival of the ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'', Martin was offered a job as a writer. Working for television paid a lot better than writing literature, so he decided to move to Hollywood to seek a new career.<ref name=\"berwick20120601\">{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/bd1e2638-a8b7-11e1-a747-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1wYzURCl0 | title=Lunch with the FT: George RR Martin | work=Financial Times | date=June 1, 2012 | access-date=June 1, 2012 | author=Berwick, Isabel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=mp2dODRtZOUC&pg=PT8&dq=fantasy+Moorcock's+Elric+Howard's+Solomon+Kane,+Gray+Mouser+Dominic+Flandry&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKvM_8lpPYAhVNbFAKHQQ0AbkQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q=fantasy+Moorcock's+Elric+Howard's+Solomon+Kane,+Gray+Mouser+Dominic+Flandry&f=false|title=Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective|first=George R.

After the [[CBS]] series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science fiction series [[Max Headroom (TV series)|''Max Headroom'']]. He worked on scripts and created the show's \"Ped Xing\" character. However, before his scripts could go into production, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was then hired as a writer-producer on the new dramatic fantasy series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]''; in 1989, he became the show's co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.\n\nIn 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in ''Portraits of His Children''. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author ''[[Wild Cards]]'' book series, which takes place in a [[shared universe]] in which a small slice of post\u2013[[World War II]] humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are still being published in the ongoing series from [[Tor Books]].

Martin's involvement included the selection of a production team and participation in scriptwriting; the opening credits list him as a co-executive producer of the series. The series was renewed shortly after the first episode aired.\n\nThe first season was nominated for 13 [[Emmy Awards]], ultimately winning two: one for its opening title credits, and one for [[Peter Dinklage]] as Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe first season was also nominated for a 2012 Hugo Award, fantasy and science fiction's oldest award, presented by the [[World Science Fiction Society]] each year at the annual [[World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon]]; the show went on to win the 2012 Hugo for ''Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form'', at [[Chicon 7]], the [[70th World Science Fiction Convention]], in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. Martin took home one of the three Hugo Award trophies awarded in that collaborative category, the other two going to ''Game of Thrones'' show-runners [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss|D. B. Weiss]].\n\nThe second season, based on the second ''A Song of'' ''Ice and Fire'' novel ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'', began airing on HBO in the US on April 1, 2012. The second season was nominated for 12 Emmy Awards, including another Supporting Actor nomination for Dinklage. It went on to win six of those Emmys in the Technical Arts categories, which were awarded the week before the regular televised 2012 awards show. The second-season episode \"[[Blackwater (Game of Thrones)|Blackwater]]\", written by George R.R. Martin, was nominated the following year for the 2013 Hugo Award in the ''Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form'' category; that episode went on to win the Hugo Award at LoneStarCon 3, the [[71st World Science Fiction Convention]], in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. In addition to Martin, show-runners Benioff and Weiss (who contributed several scenes to the final screenplay) and episode director Neil Marshal (who expanded the scope of the episode on set) received Hugo statuettes.\n\nSeasons 5 and 6 each won a dozen [[Emmy Awards]], including Outstanding Drama Series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/game-of-thrones-hbo-marathon-year-end-1201946918/ |title='Game of Thrones': Year-End Marathon to Air on HBO |last=Yee |first=Lawrence |date=December 21, 2016 |website=Variety |publisher=Variety |access-date=December 21, 2016 |quote=It has been nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Drama every season it's aired, winning the award the last two years.

This story has a strong sense of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to [[idealism]]s in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of [[tragic hero]]es or [[antihero]]es in them; reviewer T. M.

R. Martin]]. He began the first volume of the series, ''[[A Game of Thrones]],'' in 1991, and it was published in 1996. Martin, who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy, has published five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and most recent volume of the series published in 2011, ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', took Martin six years to write. He is currently writing the sixth novel, ''[[The Winds of Winter]]''.\n\n''A Song of Ice and Fire'' takes place on the fictional continents [[Westeros]] and [[Essos]]. The [[Point of view (literature)#Narrative point of view|point of view]] of each chapter in the story is a [[Point of view (literature)#Third-person, subjective|limited]] perspective of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to 31 characters by the fifth novel. Three main stories interweave: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural [[Others (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Others]] in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of [[Daenerys Targaryen]], the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]].\n\nMartin's inspirations included the [[Wars of the Roses]] and the French [[Historical fiction|historical novels]] ''[[The Accursed Kings]]'' by [[Maurice Druon]].<ref name=\"bbc french\"/><ref name=\"jewish legacy\"/> ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion, as well as its realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured.

Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel, the Seven Kingdoms of [[Westeros]] were united under the [[Targaryen]] dynasty by Aegon I and his sister wives Visenya and Rhaenys, establishing military supremacy through their control of dragons. Aegon became the first king of the entire continent of Westeros, save for the southerly region of Dorne. The Targaryen dynasty ruled for three hundred years, although civil war and infighting between the Targaryens resulted in the death of all their dragons. At the beginning of ''A Game of Thrones'', 15 peaceful years have passed since the rebellion led by Lord [[Robert Baratheon]] that deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II \"the Mad King\", and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine-year-long summer coming to an end.\n\nThe principal story chronicles the power struggle for the Iron Throne among the great Houses of Westeros following the death of King Robert in ''A Game of Thrones''. Robert's heir apparent, the 13-year-old [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], is immediately proclaimed king through the machinations of his mother, Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]. When Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard \"Ned\" Stark]], Robert's closest friend and chief advisor, discovers that Joffrey and his siblings are the product of incest between Cersei and her twin brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime \"The Kingslayer\" Lannister]], Eddard attempts to unseat Joffrey, but is betrayed and executed for treason. In response, Robert's brothers [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] both lay separate claims to the throne. During this period of instability, two of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros attempt to become independent from the Iron Throne: Eddard's eldest son [[Robb Stark|Robb]] is proclaimed King in the North, while Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]] desires to recover the sovereignty of his region, the Iron Islands. The so-called \"War of the Five Kings\" is in full progress by the middle of the second book, ''[[A Clash of Kings]]''.\n\nThe second part of story takes place in the far north of Westeros, where an 8,000-year-old wall of ice, simply called \"[[The Wall (A Song of Ice and Fire)|the Wall]]\", defends the Seven Kingdoms from supernatural creatures known as [[White Walker|the Others]]. The Wall's sentinels, the Sworn Brotherhood of the [[Night's Watch]], also protect the realm from the incursions of the \"[[wildlings]]\" or \"Free Folk\", who are several human tribes living on the north side of the Wall. The Night's Watch story is told primarily through the point of view of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], Lord Eddard Stark's [[illegitimacy|bastard son]].<ref name=\"Forbes1\"/> Jon follows the footsteps of his uncle [[Benjen Stark]] and joins the Watch at a young age, rising quickly through the ranks.  He eventually becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. In the third volume, ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'', the Night's Watch storyline becomes increasingly entangled with the War of the Five Kings.\n\nThe third story follows [[Daenerys Targaryen]], daughter of Aerys II, the last Targaryen king. On the continent of Essos, east of Westeros [[across the Narrow Sea]], Daenerys is married off by her elder brother [[Viserys Targaryen]] to a powerful warlord, but slowly becomes an independent and intelligent ruler in her own right. Her rise to power is aided by the historic birth of three [[European dragon|dragons]], hatched from eggs given to her as wedding gifts. The three dragons soon become not only a symbol of her bloodline and her legitimate claim to the throne, but also devastating weapons of war, which help her in conquest of the Slaver's bay.\n\n==Publishing history==\n\n===Overview===\nBooks in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series are first published in hardcover and are later re-released as paperback editions.

Martin]] at Archipelacon in [[Mariehamn]], 2015.]]\nGeorge R. R. Martin was already a successful fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' book series.<ref name=ew_fantasy_king /> Martin had published his first short story in 1971 and his first novel in 1977.<ref name=indigo_iv2 /> By the mid-1990s, he had won three [[Hugo Awards]], two [[Nebula Awards]], and other awards for his short fiction.<ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine /> Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s.<ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine /> He worked principally on the [[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|revival of ''The Twilight Zone'']] throughout 1986 and on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made<ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine /> and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes.<ref name=nytimes_twisted /> This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination.<ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine /> Admiring the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.<ref name=grmm_iv_ew />\n\nWhen Martin was between Hollywood projects in the summer of 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called ''Avalon''. After three chapters, he had a vivid idea of a boy seeing a man's beheading and finding direwolves in the snow, which would eventually become the first non-prologue chapter of ''A Game of Thrones''.<ref name=rollingstone_grrmiv /> Putting ''Avalon'' aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that it was part of a longer story.<ref name=grmm_iv_weirdtm /> After a few more chapters, Martin perceived his new book as a fantasy story<ref name=grmm_iv_weirdtm /> and started making maps and genealogies.<ref name=ew_fantasy_king /> However, the writing of this book was interrupted for a few years when Martin returned to Hollywood to produce his TV series ''[[Doorways]]'' that [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] had ordered but ultimately never aired.<ref name=nytimes_twisted />\n\n{{Quote box | quote=\"The first scene...chapter one of the first book, the chapter where they find the direwolf pups...just came to me out of nowhere. I was...at work on a different novel, and suddenly I saw that scene. It didn't belong in the novel I was writing, but it came to me so vividly that I had to sit down and write it, and by the time I did, it led to a second chapter, and the second chapter was the Catelyn chapter where Ned has just come back.\"| source =\u2014George R. R. Martin in 2014<ref name=vanityfair_catchup /> | width =250px | align =right}}\n\nIn 1994, Martin gave his agent, [[Kirby McCauley]], the first 200 pages and a two-page story projection as part of a planned trilogy with the novels ''A Dance with Dragons'' and ''The Winds of Winter'' intended to follow. When Martin had still not reached the novel's end at 1400 manuscript pages, he felt that the series needed to be four and eventually six books long,<ref name=nytimes_twisted /><ref name=tiff1 /> which he imagined as two linked trilogies of one long story.<ref name=grrm_iv_infinityplus /> Martin chose ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' as the overall series title: Martin saw the struggle of the cold Others and the fiery dragons as one possible meaning for \"Ice and Fire\", whereas the word \"song\" had previously appeared in Martin's book titles ''[[A Song for Lya]]'' and ''Songs the Dead Men Sing'', stemming from his obsessions with songs.<ref name=fantasyonline /> Martin also named [[Robert Frost]]'s 1920 poem \"[[Fire and Ice (poem)|Fire and Ice]]\" and cultural associations such as passion versus betrayal as possible influences for the series' title.<ref name=adria_trying />\n\nThe revised finished manuscript for ''A Game of Thrones'' was 1088 pages long (without the appendices),<ref name=\"Done 2005\" /> with the publication following in August 1996.<ref name=pw_review_agot /> ''Wheel of Time'' author [[Robert Jordan]] had written a short endorsement for the cover that was influential in ensuring the book's and hence series' early success with fantasy readers.<ref name=ew_by_george /> ''Blood of the Dragon'', a pre-release sample novella drawn from Daenerys's chapters, went on to win the 1997 Hugo Award for Best Novella.<ref name=scifi_magical_tale />\n\nThe 300 pages removed from the ''A Game of Thrones'' manuscript served as the opening of the second book, entitled ''[[A Clash of Kings]]''.<ref name=tiff1 /> It was released in February 1999 in the United States,<ref name=pw_review_acok /> with a manuscript length (without appendices) of 1184 pages.<ref name=\"Done 2005\" /> ''A Clash of Kings'' was the first book of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series to make the best-seller lists,<ref name=nytimes_twisted /> reaching 13 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] in 1999.<ref name=nytimes_bs990221 /> After the success of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films, Martin received his first inquiries to the rights of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series from various producers and filmmakers.<ref name=nytimes_twisted />\n\nMartin was several months late turning in the third book, ''[[A Storm of Swords]]''.<ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine /> The last chapter he had written was about the \"Red Wedding\", a pivotal scene notable for its violence (see [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Violence and death|Themes: Violence and death]]).<ref name=indigo_iv1 /> ''A Storm of Swords'' was 1521 pages in manuscript (without appendices),<ref name=\"Done 2005\" /> causing problems for many of Martin's publishers around the world. [[Bantam Books]] published ''A Storm of Swords'' in a single volume in the United States in November 2000,<ref name=pw_review_asos /> whereas some other-language editions were divided into two, three, or even four volumes.<ref name=\"Done 2005\" /> ''A Storm of Swords'' debuted at number 12 in the ''New York Times'' bestseller list.<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /><ref name=nytimes_bs001119 />\n\n===Bridging the timeline gap (2000\u20132011) {{Anchor|Bridging the timeline gap}}===\nAfter ''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Clash of Kings'', and ''A Storm of Swords'', Martin originally intended to write three more books.<ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine /> The fourth<!--yes, fourth--> book, tentatively titled ''A Dance with Dragons'', was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts.<ref name=grrm_iv_infinityplus /> Martin wanted to set this story five years after ''A Storm of Swords'' so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger.<ref name=grrm_iv_locusmag /> Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than ''A Storm of Swords'', Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to ''A Clash of Kings''.<ref name=\"Done 2005\" /> A long prologue was to establish what had happened in the meantime, initially just as one chapter of [[Aeron Damphair]] on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.<ref name=gamepro />\n\nIn 2001, Martin was still optimistic that the fourth installment might be released in the last quarter of 2002.<ref name=fantasyonline /> However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years.<ref name=grrm_iv_locusmag /> After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called ''[[A Feast for Crows]]''.<ref name=grrm_iv_locusmag /> The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap.<ref name=fantasyonline /> The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands.<ref name=gamepro /> These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.<ref name=scifi_fowl />\n\nThe manuscript length of ''A Feast for Crows'' eventually surpassed ''A Storm of Swords''.<ref name=grrm_iv_locusmag /> Martin was reluctant to make the necessary deep cuts to get the book down to publishable length, as that would have compromised the story he had in mind. Printing the book in \"microtype on onion skin paper and giving each reader a magnifying glass\" was also not an option for him.<ref name=\"Done 2005\" /> On the other hand, Martin rejected the publishers' idea of splitting the narrative chronologically into ''A Feast for Crows'', Parts One and Two.<ref name=nytimes_vile_hobbits /> Being already late with the book, Martin had not even started writing all characters' stories<ref name=guardian_gettingmore /> and also objected to ending the first book without any resolution for its many viewpoint characters as in previous books.<ref name=grrm_iv_locusmag />\n\nWith the characters spread out across the world,<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /> a friend suggested that Martin divide the story geographically into two volumes, of which ''A Feast for Crows'' would be the first.<ref name=nytimes_vile_hobbits /> This approach would give Martin the room to complete his commenced story arcs as he had originally intended,<ref name=\"Done 2005\" /> which he still felt was the best approach years later.<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /> Martin moved the unfinished characters' stories set in the east (Essos) and north (Winterfell and the Wall) into the next book, ''A Dance with Dragons'',<ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb /> and left ''A Feast for Crows'' to cover the events in King's Landing, the Riverlands, Dorne, and the Iron Islands.<ref name=\"Done 2005\" /> Both books begin immediately after the end of ''A Storm of Swords'',<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /> running in parallel instead of sequentially, and involve different casts of characters with only little overlap.<ref name=\"Done 2005\" /> Martin split Arya's chapters into both books after having already moved the three other most popular characters (Jon Snow, Tyrion, and Daenerys) into ''A Dance with Dragons''.<ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb />\n\nUpon its release in October 2005 in the UK<ref name=amazon_pubdate_AFFC /> and November 2005 in the US,<ref name=pw_review_affc /> ''A Feast for Crows'' went straight to the top of ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller list.<ref name=nytimes_bs051127 /> Among the positive reviewers was Lev Grossman of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', who dubbed Martin \"the American Tolkien\".<ref name=time_american_tolkien /> However, fans and critics alike were disappointed with the story split that left the fates of several popular characters unresolved after ''A Storm of Swords''{{'}} cliffhanger ending.<ref name=newyorker /><ref name=time_problem_power /> With ''A Dance with Dragons'' said to be half-finished,<ref name=newyorker /> Martin mentioned in the epilogue of ''A Feast for Crows'' that the next volume would be released by the next year.<ref name=globeandmail /> However, planned release dates were repeatedly pushed back. Meanwhile, [[HBO]] acquired the rights to turn ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' into a dramatic series in 2007<ref name=\"variety2007-01\" /> and aired the first of ten episodes covering ''A Game of Thrones'' in April 2011.<ref name=variety_selling />\n\nWith around 1600 pages in manuscript length,<ref name=guardian_barbarians /> ''A Dance with Dragons'' was eventually published in July 2011 after six years of writing,<ref name=nytimes_twisted /> longer in page count and writing time than any of the preceding four novels.<ref name=ew_fantasy_king /><ref name=newyorker /> The story of ''A Dance with Dragons'' catches up with and goes beyond ''A Feast for Crows'' around two-thirds into the book,<ref name=guardian_gettingmore /> but nevertheless covers less story than Martin had intended, omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliff-hangers.<ref name=ew_fantasy_king /> Martin attributed the delay mainly to his untangling \"the [[Meereen]]ese knot\", which the interviewer understood as \"making the chronology and characters mesh up as various threads converged on [Daenerys]\".<ref name=time_problem_power /> Martin also acknowledged spending too much time on rewriting and perfecting the story, but soundly rejected the theories of some of his critics that he had lost interest in the series or would bide his time to make more money.<ref name=newyorker />\n\n===Planned novels and future===\nMartin believes the last two volumes of the series will be big books of 1500 manuscript pages each.<ref name=empire_webchat /> The sixth book will be called ''[[The Winds of Winter]]'',<ref name=dancingincircles /> taking the title of the last book of the originally planned trilogy.<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /> Displeased with the provisional title ''A Time for Wolves'' for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced ''A Dream of Spring'' as the title for the seventh book in 2006.<ref name=grrm_blog_060326 /> Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear in the book.<ref name=smartertravel />\n\n====''The Winds of Winter'' ====\n{{further|The Winds of Winter}}\n''[[The Winds of Winter]]'' will resolve the cliffhangers from ''A Dance with Dragons'' early on and \"will open with the two big battles that [the fifth book] was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle [...] of Slaver's Bay. And then take it from there.\"<ref name=smartertravel /> By the middle of 2010, Martin had already finished five chapters of ''The Winds of Winter'' from the viewpoints of [[Sansa Stark]], [[Arya Stark]], [[Arianne Martell]], and [[Aeron Greyjoy]], accumulating to around 100 completed pages.<ref name=dancingincircles /><ref name=grrm_blog_200721 /> After the publication of ''A Dance with Dragons'' in 2011, Martin announced he would return to writing in January 2012.<ref name=ew_fantasy_king /> He spent the meantime on book tours, conventions, and continued working on his ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'' companion guide and a new ''[[Tales of Dunk and Egg]]'' novella.<ref name=wsj_spill /><ref name=nymag_butterfly />\n\nIn December 2011, Martin posted a chapter from ''The Winds of Winter'' from the viewpoint of [[Theon Greyjoy]];<ref name=nydailynews_sample_chapter /> several other chapters have been made public since. Four hundred pages of the sixth novel had been written as of October 2012, although Martin considered only 200 as \"really finished\"; the rest needed revising.<ref name=adria_trying /> In 2011, Martin gave three years as a realistic estimate for finishing the sixth book at a good pace,<ref name=guardian_barbarians /> but said ultimately the book \"will be done when it's done\",<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /> acknowledging that his publication estimates had been too optimistic in the past.<ref name=ew_fantasy_king /> Martin did not intend to separate the characters geographically again.<ref name=grmm_iv_ew />\n\nIn 2015 there were indications that the book would be published before the [[Game of Thrones (season 6)|sixth season]] of the HBO show<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/03/george-rr-martin-winds-date|title='Game of Thrones' author George R.R.

On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like [[The End (Lost)|the finale of the TV series ''Lost'']], which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires.<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /> In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing ''A Dream of Spring'' together with ''The Winds of Winter'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/440213.html?thread=22477973#t22477973|title=Back From Bubonicon|first=|last=grrm|date=August 31, 2015|publisher=}}</ref> and in early 2016, he said he did not believe ''A Dream of Spring'' would be published before the last season of the HBO show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnrdaily.com/article/george-r-r-martin-says-there-will-be-winds-of-winter-spoilers-in-game-of-thrones-season-six/9239.htm|title=George R.R.

This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books' storylines are also being considered, but a two-year show hiatus to wait for new books is not an option for them as the child actors continue to grow and the show's popularity would wane.<ref name=hitfix /> Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series.<ref name=newyorker /> On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published before the start of the sixth season of the HBO series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/the-dartboard/game-of-thrones-season-6-will-be-out-before-george-rr-martins-next-book|title=\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 season 6 will be out before George R.R.

The short-lived one-time POV characters are mostly restricted to the [[prologue]] and [[epilogue]].<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> David Orr of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted the story importance of \"the [[House Stark|Starks]] (good guys), the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] (at least one good guy, or girl), the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] (conniving), the [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoys]] (mostly conniving), the [[House Baratheon|Baratheons]] (mixed bag), the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] (unclear) and the [[House Martell|Martells]] (ditto), most of whom are feverishly endeavoring to advance their ambitions and ruin their enemies, preferably unto death\".<ref name=nytimes_rise_fantasy /> However, as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'s}} [[Lev Grossman]] noted, readers \"experience the struggle for Westeros from all sides at once\", such that \"every fight is both triumph and tragedy [...] and everybody is both hero and villain at the same time\".<ref name=time_masterpiece_tolkien />\n\nModeled on ''The Lord of the Rings'', the story of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' begins with a tight focus on a small group (with everyone in [[Winterfell]], except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing.<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /> Depending on the interview, Martin is said to have reached the turning point in ''A Dance with Dragons'',<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /> or to not quite have reached it yet in the books.<ref name=io9_gods /> The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by ''[[Wild Cards]]'', a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985.<ref name=grrm_iv_boomtron /> As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.<ref name=scifi_magical_tale />\n\nInfluenced by his television and film scripting background, Martin tries to keep readers engrossed by ending each ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' chapter with a tense or revelational moment, a twist or a [[cliffhanger]], similar to a TV [[Act structure|act break]].<ref name=time_grrm_ivp1 /> Scriptwriting has also taught him the technique of \"cutting out the fat and leaving the muscle\", which is the final stage of completing a book, a technique that brought the page count in ''A Dance with Dragons'' down almost eighty pages.<ref name=grrm_blog_110519 /> Dividing the continuous ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' story into books is much harder for Martin. Each book shall represent a phase of the journey that ends in closure for most characters. A smaller portion of characters is left with clear-cut cliffhangers to make sure readers come back for the next installment, although ''A Dance with Dragons'' had more cliffhangers than Martin originally intended.<ref name=grmm_iv_ew /><ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> Both one-time and regular POV characters are designed to have full character arcs ending in tragedy or triumph,<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> and are written to hold the readers' interest and not be skipped in reading.<ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2 /> Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not rely on the hero to come through unscathed and will instead feel the character's fear with each page turn.<ref name=ew_by_george />\n\nThe unresolved larger narrative arc encourages speculation about future story events.<ref name=newyorker /> According to Martin, much of the key to ''A Song of Ice and Fire''{{'s}} future lies over a dozen<!--the source's \"sixteen\" refers only to ASOS--> years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more.<ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine /> Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful not to make the story predictable.<ref name=io9_gods /> The viewpoint characters, who serve as [[unreliable narrator]]s,<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /> may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events.<ref name=atlantic_true_blood /> Therefore, what the readers believe to be true may not necessarily be true.<ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine />\n\n===Character development===\n{{main|List of A Song of Ice and Fire characters}}\nRegarding the characters as the heart of the story,<ref name=grmm_iv_scotcampus /> Martin planned the epic ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' to have a large cast of characters and many different settings from the beginning.<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /> ''A Feast for Crows'' has a 63-page list of characters,<ref name=nytimes_vile_hobbits /> with many of the thousands of characters mentioned only in passing<ref name=newyorker /> or disappearing from view for long stretches.<ref name=washingtonpost_worth_wait /> When Martin adds a new family to the ever-growing number of [[genealogy|genealogies]] in the appendices, he devises a secret about the personality or fate of the family members. However, their backstory remains subject to change until written down in the story.<ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb /> Martin drew most character inspiration from history (without directly translating historical figures)<ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine /> and his own experiences, but also from the manners of his friends, acquaintances, and people of public interest.<ref name=fantasyonline /> Martin aims to \"make my characters real and to make them human, characters who have good and bad, noble and selfish well-mixed in their natures\".<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> Jeff VanderMeer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' remarked that \"Martin's devotion to fully inhabiting his characters, for better or worse, creates the unstoppable momentum in his novels and contains an implied criticism of Tolkien's moral simplicity\"<ref name=latimes_adwdreview /> (see [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Moral ambiguity|Themes: Moral ambiguity]]).\n\nMartin deliberately ignored the writing rule of never giving two characters names starting with the same letter.<ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb /> Instead, character names reflect the naming systems in various European family histories, where particular names were associated with specific [[dynasty|royal houses]] and where even the secondary families assigned the same names repeatedly.<ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb /> The story of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' therefore has children called \"Robert\" in honor of King Robert of House Baratheon, a \"Brandon\" in every other generation of the Starks in commemoration of Brandon the Builder (of the Wall), and the syllable \"Ty\" commonly occurring in given names of House Lannister.<ref name=tiff1 /> Confident that readers would pay attention, Martin distinguished people sharing a [[given name]]<ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb /> by adding numbers or locations to their given names (e.g. [[Henry V of England]]).<ref name=tiff1 /> The family names were designed in association with ethnic groups (see [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Background|backstory]]): the First Men in the North of Westeros had very simply descriptive names like Stark and Strong, whereas the descendants of the Andal invaders in the South have more elaborate, undescriptive house names like Lannister or Arryn, and the Targaryens and Valyrians from the Eastern continent have the most exotic names with the letter Y.<ref name=tiff1 />\n\nAll characters are designed to speak with their own internal voices to capture their views of the world.<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> ''The Atlantic'' pondered whether Martin ultimately intended the readers to sympathize with characters on both sides of the Lannister\u2013Stark feud long before plot developments force them to make their emotional choices.<ref name=atlantic_reality /> Contrary to most conventional epic fantasies, the characters of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' are vulnerable so that, according to ''The Atlantic'', the reader \"cannot be sure that good shall triumph, which makes those instances where it does all the more exulting.\"<ref name=atlantic_brutal /> Martin gets emotionally involved in the characters' lives during writing, which makes the chapters with dreadful events sometimes very difficult to write.<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> Seeing the world through the characters' eyes requires a certain amount of empathy with them, including the villains,<ref name=deepmagic41 /> all of whom he has said he loves as if they were his own children.<ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2 /><ref name=grmm_iv_scotcampus /> Martin found that some characters had minds of their own and took his writing in different directions. He returns to the intended story if it does not work out, but these detours sometimes prove more rewarding for him.<ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb />\n\nArya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen generate the most feedback from readers.<ref name=grmm_iv_cc /> Martin has stated that Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write.<ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2 /> Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character,<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> and has to deal with the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger.<ref name=time_grrm_ivp1 /> Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section [[#Bridging the timeline gap|Bridging the timeline gap]]).<ref name=grmm_iv_ew /><ref name=scifi_magical_tale />\n\n==Themes==\n{{Main|Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire}}\n<!--DEAR EDITOR: This section is to summarize [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire]] per [[Wikipedia:Summary style]]. Nothing new should be added here unless it is also covered in the Themes main article WITH A RELIABLE SOURCE.-->\n[[File:Face in the Pool-Knight Fighting Dragon.jpg|thumb|Although involving dragons and sorcery, ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series de-emphasizes magic as compared to many other epic fantasy works (emblem of [[J. Allen St. John]]'s 1905 fantasy work ''The Face in the Pool'').]]\n\nAlthough modern fantasy may often embrace strangeness, ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism.<ref name=nytimes_rise_fantasy /> Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre,<ref name=nytimes_twisted /> Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters.<ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine /> Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies.<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension,<ref name=nymag_butterfly /> not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells.<ref name=amazon_storm /> As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.<ref name=nytimes_rise_fantasy />\n\nSince Martin drew on historical sources to build the world of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' ,<ref name=deepmagic41 /> Damien G. Walter of ''[[The Guardian]]'' saw a strong resemblance between Westeros and England in the period of the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref name=guardian_reality /> ''The Atlantic''{{'s}} Adam Serwer regarded ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' as \"more a story of politics than one of heroism, a story about humanity wrestling with its baser obsessions than fulfilling its glorious potential\", where the emergent power struggle stems from the feudal system's repression and not from the fight between good and evil.<ref name=atlantic_reality /> Martin not only wanted to reflect the frictions of the medieval class structures in the novels, but also explore the consequences of the leaders' decisions, as general goodness does not automatically make competent leaders and vice versa.<ref name=time_grrm_ivp2 />\n\nA common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between [[good and evil]],<ref name=time_grrm_ivp2 /> which Martin rejects for not mirroring the real world.<ref name=grrm_iv_infinityplus /> Attracted to gray characters,<ref name=usatoday_released /> Martin instead endorses [[William Faulkner]]'s view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about.<ref name=time_grrm_ivp2 /> Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series.<ref name=guardian_tt /> The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.<ref name=cnn/><ref name=gamepro />\n\nAlthough fantasy comes from an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest necessity to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people.<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might.<ref name=ew_by_george /> The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war.<ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2 /> The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact.<ref name=io9_gods /> Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.<ref name=grmm_iv_ew />\n\nAccording to Martin, the fantasy genre rarely focuses on sex and sexuality,<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> instead often treating sexuality in a juvenile way or neglecting it completely.<ref name=deepmagic41 /> Martin, however, considers sexuality an important driving force in human life that should not be excluded from the narrative.<ref name=guardian_tt /> Providing sensory detail for an immersive experience is more important than plot advancement for Martin,<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /> who aims to let the readers experience the novels' sex scenes, \"whether it's a great transcendent, exciting, mind blowing sex, or whether it's disturbing, twisted, dark sex, or disappointing perfunctory sex.\"<ref name=guardian_tt /> Martin was fascinated by medieval contrasts where knights venerated their ladies with poems and wore their favors in tournaments while their armies mindlessly raped women in wartime.<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> The non-existent concept of adolescence in the Middle Ages served as a model for Daenerys' sexual activity at the age of 13 in the books.<ref name=time_grrm_ivp1 /> The novels also allude to the incestuous practices in the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of [[Ancient Egypt]] to keep their bloodlines pure.<ref name=nytimes_oedipus />\n\nMartin provides a variety of female characters to explore the place of women in a patriarchal society.<ref name=io9_gods /> Writing all characters as human beings with the same basic needs, dreams, and influences,<ref name=indigo_iv2 /> his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits as the males.<ref name=io9_gods /><ref name=indigo_iv2 />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''[[Science Fiction Weekly]]'' stated in 2000 that \"few would dispute that Martin's most monumental achievement to date has been the groundbreaking ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' historical fantasy series\",<ref name=scifi_magical_tale /> for which reviews have been \"orders of magnitude better\" than for his previous works, as Martin described to ''The New Yorker''.<ref name=newyorker /> In 2007, ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine described the series as a \"superb fantasy saga\" that \"raised Martin to a whole new level of success\".<ref name=grmm_iv_weirdtm /> Shortly before the release of ''A Dance with Dragons'' in 2011, Bill Sheehan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was sure that \"no work of fantasy has generated such anticipation since [[Harry Potter]]'s final duel with Voldemort\",<ref name=washingtonpost_worth_wait /> and Ethan Sacks of ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' saw the series turning Martin into a darling of literary critics as well as mainstream readers, which was \"rare for a fantasy genre that's often dismissed as garbage not fit to line the bottom of a dragon's cage\".<ref name=nydailynews_sample_chapter /> [[Salon.com]]'s [[Andrew Leonard]] stated:<blockquote>The success is all the more remarkable because [the series debuted] without mass market publicity or any kind of buzz in the fantasy/SF scene. George R. R. Martin earned his following the hard way, by word of mouth, by hooking his characters into the psyche of his readers to an extent that most writers of fantasy only dream of.<ref name=\"salon_primer\" /></blockquote>''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' noted in 2000 that \"Martin may not rival [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] or [[Robert Jordan]], but he ranks with such accomplished medievalists of fantasy as [[Poul Anderson]] and [[Gordon R. Dickson|Gordon Dickson]].\"<ref name=\"pw_review_asos\" /> After the fourth volume came out in 2005, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'s}} Lev Grossman considered Martin a \"major force for evolution in fantasy\" and proclaimed him \"the American Tolkien\", explaining that, although Martin was \"[not] the best known of America's straight-up fantasy writers\" at the time and would \"never win a [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] or a [[National Book Award]]&nbsp;... his skill as a crafter of narrative exceeds that of almost any literary novelist writing today\".<ref name=\"time_american_tolkien\" /> As Grossman said in 2011, the phrase ''American Tolkien'' \"has stuck to [Martin], as it was meant to\",<ref name=\"time_masterpiece_tolkien\" /> being picked up by the media including ''[[The New York Times]]'' (\"He's much better than that\"),<ref name=\"nytimes_adwdreview\" /> the ''New Yorker'',<ref name=\"newyorker\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' (\"an acclaim that borders on fantasy blasphemy\"),<ref name=\"ew_fantasy_king\" /> ''The Globe and Mail'',<ref name=\"globeandmail\" /> and ''USA Today''.<ref name=\"usatoday_released\" /> ''Time'' magazine named Martin one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011,<ref name=\"globeandmail\" /> and ''USA Today'' named George R.R. Martin their Author of the Year 2011.<ref name=\"usatoday_year\" />\n\nAccording to ''The Globe and Mail''{{'s}} John Barber, Martin manages simultaneously to master and transcend the genre so that \"Critics applaud the depth of his characterizations and lack of clich\u00e9 in books that are nonetheless replete with dwarves and dragons\".<ref name=\"globeandmail\" /> ''Publishers Weekly'' gave favorable reviews to the first three ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels at their points of release, saying that ''A Game of Thrones'' had \"superbly developed characters, accomplished prose and sheer bloody-mindedness\",<ref name=\"pw_review_agot\" /> that ''A Clash of Kings'' was \"notable particularly for the lived-in quality of [their fictional world and] for the comparatively modest role of magic\",<ref name=\"pw_review_acok\" /> and that ''A Storm of Swords'' was one \"of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy\".<ref name=\"pw_review_asos\" /> However, they found that ''A Feast For Crows'' as the fourth installment \"sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying.\"<ref name=\"pw_review_affc\" /> Their review for ''A Dance with Dragons'' repeated points of criticism for the fourth volume, and said that, although \"The new volume has a similar feel to ''Feast''\", \"Martin keeps it fresh by focusing on popular characters [who were] notably absent from the previous book.\"<ref name=\"pw_review_adwd\" />\n\nAccording to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', \"Martin's brilliance in evoking atmosphere through description is an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings much more than just props on a painted stage\", and the novels captivate readers with \"complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters\".<ref name=\"latimes_adwdreview\" /> [[CNN]] remarked that \"the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style\",<ref name=\"cnn\" /> and David Orr of ''The New York Times'' found that \"All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles.\"<ref name=\"nytimes_rise_fantasy\" /> Salon.com's Andrew Leonard \"couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire to know what was going to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted.\"<ref name=\"salon_fantasy_king\" /> ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' advised reading the novels with an ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' encyclopedia at hand to \"catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [Martin] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered.\"<ref name=\"csmonitor_adwdreview\" />\n\nAmong the most critical voices were Sam Jordison and Michael Hann, both of ''The Guardian''. Jordison detailed his misgivings about ''A Game of Thrones'' in a 2009 review and summarized \"It's daft. It's unsophisticated. It's cartoonish. And yet, I couldn't stop reading&nbsp;.... Archaic absurdity aside, Martin's writing is excellent. His dialogue is snappy and frequently funny. His descriptive prose is immediate and atmospheric, especially when it comes to building a sense of deliciously dark foreboding [of the long impending winter].\"<ref name=\"guardian_getting_hooked\" /> Hann did not consider the novels to stand out from the general fantasy genre, despite Martin's alterations to fantasy convention, although he rediscovered his childhood's views:<blockquote>That when things are, on the whole, pretty crappy [in the real world], it's a deep joy to dive headfirst into something so completely immersive, something from which there is no need to surface from hours at a time. And if that immersion involves dragons, magic, wraiths from beyond death, shapeshifting wolves and banished princes, so be it.<ref name=\"guardian_flights_fantasy\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Sales===\n[[File:ASOIAF 2011 NYT Bestseller List.png|thumb|Sales performance of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series in the ''New York Times'' combined print and e-book fiction bestseller list in 2011 between the airing of the ''Game of Thrones'' pilot episode and the publication of ''A Dance with Dragons''.<ref name=nytimes_graph />]]\n\nThe reported overall sales figures of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series vary.

The series gained Martin's old writings new attention, and Martin's American publisher [[Bantam Spectra]] was to reprint his out-of-print solo novels.<ref name=scifi_magical_tale />\n\nThe fourth installment, ''A Feast for Crows'', was an immediate best-seller at its 2005 release,<ref name=ew_fantasy_king /> hitting number one on \"The New York Times\" hardcover fiction bestseller list November 27, 2005, which for a fantasy novel suggested that Martin's books were attracting mainstream readers.<ref name=guardian_barbarians /> The paperback edition of ''A Game of Thrones'' reached its 34th printing in 2010, surpassing the one million mark.<ref name=grrm_blog_101006 /> Before it even premiered, the TV series had boosted sales of the book series, with ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' approaching triple-digit growth in year-on-year sales. Bantam was looking forward to seeing the tie-ins boost sales further,<ref name=variety_selling /> and Martin's British publisher [[Harper Voyager]] expected readers to rediscover their other epic fantasy literature.<ref name=pw_gains /> With a reported 4.5&nbsp;million copies of the first four volumes in print in early 2011,<ref name=variety_selling /> the four volumes re-appeared on the paperback fiction bestseller lists in the second quarter of 2011.<ref name=nytimes_graph /><ref name=nytimes_bestseller />\n\nAt its point of publication in July 2011, ''A Dance with Dragons'' was in its sixth print with more than 650,000 hardbacks in print.<ref name=guardian_charts /> It also had the highest single and first-day sales of any new fiction title published in 2011 at that point, with 170,000 hardcovers, 110,000 e-books, and 18,000 audio books reportedly sold on the first day.<ref name=usatoday_record /> ''A Dance with Dragons'' reached the top of ''The New York Times'' bestseller list on July 31, 2011.<ref name=nytimes_vile_hobbits /> Unlike most other big titles, the fifth volume sold more physical than digital copies early on,<ref name=nytimes_sells_well /> but nevertheless, Martin became the tenth author to sell 1&nbsp;million [[Amazon Kindle]] e-books.<ref name=latimes_kindle /> All five volumes and the four-volume boxed set were among the top 100 best-selling books in the United States in 2011 and 2012.<ref name=usatoday_100best />\n\nThe TV series has contributed significantly boosting sales of both the books and collectibles like box-sets, merchandise, and other items. The TV series also contributed in increasing the geographic coverage of the books, introducing new customers in emerging countries like India and Brazil to the book series.

The ''[[Tales of Dunk and Egg]]'' series, three novellas set ninety years before the events of the novel series, feature the adventures of Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire \"Egg\", the later King Aegon V Targaryen.

R. Martin]] take place is divided into several continents, known collectively as The Known World.\n\nMost of the story takes place on the continent of Westeros and in a large political entity known as the Seven Kingdoms. Those kingdoms are spread across nine regions: the North, the Iron Islands, the Riverlands, the Vale, the Westerlands, the Stormlands, the Reach, the Crownlands, and Dorne.<ref group=S name=eventhorizon_chat/>{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Arya I, p. 71}}{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Martell, p. 830}} A massive wall of ice and old magic separates the Seven Kingdoms from the largely unmapped area to the north. The vast continent of Essos is east of Westeros, across the \"Narrow Sea\". The closest foreign nations to Westeros are the Free Cities, which is a collection of independent city-states along the western edge of Essos. The lands along the southern coastline of Essos are called the Lands of the Summer Sea and include Slavers Bay and the ruins of Valyria. The latter is  the former home of Westeros' [[House Targaryen|Targaryen kings]]. To the south of Essos are the continents of Sothoryos and Ulthos, which in the narrative are largely unexplored.\n\nThe planet experiences erratic [[season]]s of unpredictable duration that can last for many years.<ref group=S name=grmm_iv_weirdtm/> At the beginning of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', Westeros has enjoyed a decade-long summer, with many fearing that an equally long and harsh winter will follow.\n\n{{anchor|World|World and fictional history|Backstory|Background}}\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin set the ''Ice and Fire'' story in an alternative world of Earth, a \"[[secondary world]]\", such as [[J. R. R.

Each new book has added one or two maps so that, as of ''A Dance with Dragons'', seven maps of the fictional world are available in the books. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were uneducated about distant places.<ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> He also did not \"subscribe to the theory put forth in ''[[The Tough Guide To Fantasyland]]'' ... that eventually the characters must visit every place shown on The Map.\"<ref group=S name=ssm_easternlands/> He conceded, however, that readers may be able to piece together a world map by the end of the series.<ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> He was intentionally vague about the size of the ''Ice and Fire'' world, omitting a scale on the maps to discourage prediction of travel lengths based on measured distances.<ref group=S name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/> A new map artist was used in ''A Dance with Dragons'' so that the maps are available in two versions by James Sinclair and Jeffrey L. Ward, depending on the book. The old maps were redone to match the style of the new ones.<ref group=S name=indigo_iv1/>\n\nA set of foldout maps was published on October 30, 2012 as ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' ({{ISBN|978-0345538543}}). The illustrator and cartographer Jonathan Roberts drew the maps, based on drafts by Martin. The twelve maps in the set are entitled \"The Known World\", \"The West\", \"Central Essos\", \"The East\", \"Westeros\", \"Beyond The Wall\", \"The Free Cities\", \"Slaver's Bay\", \"The Dothraki Sea\", \"King's Landing\", \"Braavos\", and \"Journeys\". The latter tracks the paths taken by the novels' characters.\n\n==Westeros {{anchor|Westeros|Seven Kingsdoms}}==\n{{Redirect|Westeros|the website|A Song of Ice and Fire fandom|the \"Westeros the Series\" viral video|Zondag met Lubach|similarly sounding locations|V\u00e4ster\u00e5s|and|Wester Ross}}\n{{further|Heptarchy}}\n{{Infobox fictional location\n| name       = Westeros\n| colour     = #C0C0C0\n| image      = Westeros.map.jpg\n| imagesize  = 250px\n| caption    = A map of the Westeros continent\n| source     = ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''\n| creator    = [[George R.

The continent is home to the Seven Kingdoms and lands beyond the great Wall, which makes up a large chunk of Westeros, being roughly the size of [[Canada]], with most of it largely unmapped and unexplored.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyG1rk1XgT4</ref><ref group=S name=newyorker/>\n\nAt the novel's beginning, the majority of Westeros is united under the rule of a king, with each of nine regions controlled by a different major house. Martin here drew inspiration from medieval European history,<ref group=S name=deepmagic41/><ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> in particular the [[Hundred Years' War]], the [[Crusades]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref group=S name=deepmagic41/><ref group=S name=grrm_iv_sffworld/>\n\nThe first inhabitants of the continent were the [[Children of the Forest]], a nature-worshipping anthropoid species who carved the faces of their gods in weirwood trees. Some time later, the First Men's attempts at cultivating the land led to a war with the Children of the Forest that eventually was settled by an agreement known as \"The Pact\". This was the beginning of the Age of Heroes. During that time, the First Men adopted the gods of the Children of the Forest. Those gods later became known in Westeros as the [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Old Gods|Old gods]].{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran VII, pp. 737\u2013739}}\n\nEight thousand years before the events of the novels,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon VIII, p. 656}} an enigmatic species called the [[Others (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Others]] emerged from the furthermost north during the decades-long winter known as \"The Long Night\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran IV, pp. 239\u2013240}} The Children of the Forest and the First Men jointly repelled the Others and then built a massive wall barring passage from the far north.\n\nSometime later, the Andals invaded Westeros and established the [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Faith of the Seven|Faith of the Seven]], writing, and steel. Only the North remained unconquered. The Children of the Forest disappeared from Andal lands. Over time, seven kingdoms were forged across Westeros: The North, The Iron Islands, The Vale, The Westerlands, The Stormlands, The Reach, and Dorne.<ref group=S name=eventhorizon_chat/> The Seven Kingdoms were constantly at war with one another, and no kingdom remained dominant for long.\n\nThree hundred years before the novels begin, [[Aegon the Conqueror]] and his two [[Targaryen]] sister-wives came from Dragonstone{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Targaryen, p. 832}} and landed at present-day King's Landing.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cersei VI, p. 600}} The three assembled a temporary battalion, known as \"Aegon's Fort\", which grew into the capital city.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cersei VI, p. 600}} Their powerful dragons overwhelmed six of the Seven Kingdoms through conquest or treaty, with Dorne remaining independent for another two hundred years until it was absorbed through a marriage-alliance.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Martell, p. 830}} The Targaryens built the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]], which consists of the swords of defeated rulers, fused together by dragonfire. They also established King's Landing as their capital city. They remained the ruling power on the continent until deposed by Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon.\n\n===The North {{anchor|The North|The Neck}}===\n[[File:Scotland in the UK and Europe.svg|thumb|left|Author George R. R. Martin compared the North of Westeros to {{color box|darkgreen}} [[Scotland]].<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/>]]\n\nThe North consists of the northern half of the Seven Kingdoms{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Map}} and is ruled by [[House Stark]] from their castle at Winterfell.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran I, p. 14}} The North is sparsely populated, but it is nearly as big as the other six kingdoms combined.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Eddard I, p. 41}} Martin compared the North to Scotland.<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/> The climate is cold overall, with hard winters and mild snows common regardless of season.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Eddard I, p. 41}} The region's northern border is the New Gift, which is a stretch of land 50 leagues wide and in possession of the [[Night's Watch]].{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Bran III, p. 546}} An [[isthmus]] of swampland named The Neck separates the North from the South.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Map}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Bran III, p. 329}} It is home to small, marsh-dwelling [[crannog]]men and is ruled by House Reed of Greywater Watch, bannermen of House Stark.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Bran III, p. 329}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Appendix: The King in the North, p. 985}} The Neck's narrowness, difficult terrain, and almost impenetrable Moat Cailin help protect the North from invasion.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn V, pp. 633\u2013635}} The city of White Harbor is a thriving port.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Jon I, p. 53}} Illegitimate children born of a noble parent in the North are given the surname Snow.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\n====Winterfell====\n{{redirect|Winterfell|Winterfell Industries|EFACEC}}\nWinterfell is the ancestral castle of House Stark and was built over a natural [[hot spring]]. Scalding water runs through the castle walls and warms its halls and rooms. There are several open pools where heated water collects within the godswood. The hot spring also prevents the ground from freezing.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn II, p. 58}} The castle has deep [[catacombs]] where bodies of the Starks are entombed behind statues in their likeness with a [[direwolf (fictional creature)|direwolf]] at their feet and their swords left in their hands.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Eddard I, pp. 42\u201343}} The tombs have been used since the old kings of the North, known as the Kings of Winter, were in power. They ruled before Aegon the Conqueror and the arrival of the Andals before that.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Eddard I, pp. 42\u201343}}\n\nTo depict Winterfell, both the pilot and season 1 of the television adaptation used the 16th century clock tower and ancient courtyard of the Clearsky Adventure Centre located at [[Castle Ward]] in [[County Down]], Northern Ireland,.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> [[Doune Castle]] in [[Stirling]], Scotland, which previously featured as Castle Anthrax in the film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', was also used for exterior scenes.<ref group=S name=\"BBC News 23 October 2009\"/> [[Saintfield]] Estates stood in as Winterfell's godswood, which is an enclosed wooded area where characters can worship the old gods beside trees with faces carved in their bark.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> A car park stood in for Winterfell's courtyard, and a wine cellar was used to depict the Stark family crypt.<ref group=S name=\"Den of Geek 29 February 2012\"/> [[Tollymore Forest]] featured prominently in the prologue of the pilot episode and in the pivotal scene where the Starks first find the direwolves.

The TV adaptation used [[Iceland]] as filming location for the lands Beyond the Wall. Martin, who has never been to Iceland, said Beyond the Wall was \"considerably larger than Iceland and the area closest to my Wall is densely forested, so in that sense it's more like Canada \u2014 [[Hudson Bay]] or the Canadian forests just north of [[Michigan]]. And then as you get further and further north, it changes. You get into [[tundra]] and [[ice field]]s and it becomes more of an [[arctic]] environment. You have [[plain]]s on one side and a very high range of mountains on the other. Of course, once again this is fantasy, so my mountains are more like the [[Himalayas]].\" In an HBO featurette, Martin stated the lands beyond the wall make up a big part of Westeros, being roughly the size of Canada.<ref group=S name=smartertravel/> The Valley of Thenn is one such location beyond the Wall, and north of that is the Lands of Always Winter, where the Others come from.\n\nDuring the first season, the HBO team used places that they could decorate with artificial snow for the north of the Wall, but a bigger landscape was chosen for Season 2. \"Primary filming for these scenes, which encompass both the Frostfangs and the Fist of the First Men, occurred at the Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull [[Ice calving|calving]] [[glacier]] in [[Skaftafell]], Iceland, followed by shooting near Smyrlabj\u00f6rg and [[V\u00edk \u00ed M\u00fdrdal|V\u00edk]] on H\u00f6f\u00f0abrekkuhei\u00f0i.

It is where Kingsmoots are held, and where the Grey King slew Nagga, a sea dragon, and made a court of his bones.\n\n===The Riverlands===\nThe Riverlands are the populous and fertile<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_strength\"/> areas surrounding the forks of the river [[Trident]] on Westeros. While they form one of the nine regions of Westeros, the Riverlands' central location and geographic features made the region an inter-kingdom battle zone that changed hands rather than becoming its own 'eighth' kingdom of the Seven Kingdoms.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_bywater\"/>  Centrally located between the Westerlands, the Crownlands, the Vale and the North<ref group=\"S\" name=\"hbo_viewersguide_map\"/> and lacking the natural defenses of other regions,<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Riverrunvmap\"/> they have seen frequent warfare.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_bywater\"/> The first ruler to unite the Riverlands was Benedict Justman, but the Justman dynasty died out three centuries later. The Durrandons conquered the Riverlands, but lost rule of it to Harwyn \"Hardhand\" Hoare, King of the Iron Islands. At the time of Aegon's conquest, the Riverlands were ruled by Harwyn's grandson, Harren the Black, king of the Iron Islands, and the Tullys were local nobles who rebelled against him by joining Aegon the Conqueror.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Tullyvguide\"/> As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}} illegitimate children born in the Riverlands are given the surname Rivers.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn IX, p. 649}}\n\n====Harrenhal====\nHarrenhal is an enormous ruined castle and is the site of many important events in the novels. Harrenhal was built by Harren the Black,<ref group=S name=Harrenhalvmap/> after his conquest of the Riverlands, intending to make it the largest fortification ever built in Westeros. The castle has been described as so large that an entire army was needed to garrison it. The Great Hall had 35 hearths and seated thousands. Shortly after the castle was completed, Aegon the Conqueror's dragon slew Harren, his sons, and his entire army by setting the castle alight.\n\nSince then, the ruins of the castle have been occupied by a variety of houses, all of which eventually became extinct. As a result, the people of Westeros believe the castle is cursed.<ref group=S name=Harrenhalvmap/> The logistical and economic difficulties inherent in keeping such an enormous castle maintained and garrisoned has made it something of a [[white elephant]]. At the start of the War of the Five Kings, the castle is in ruin, with only a fraction of it habitable, and held by Lady Shella Whent, the last of her House, who is stripped of Harrenhal when the Lannisters seize her castle. The castle changes hands repeatedly over the course of the novels, many of those holding it meeting unpleasant ends.\n\n====Riverrun====\nRiverrun is the ancestral stronghold of House Tully. The castle is located along one of the \"forks\" of the Trident and controls access to the interior of Westeros.  The castle is bordered on two sides by the Tumblestone River and the Red Fork. The third side fronts on a massive manmade ditch. It was built by Ser Axel Tully on land he received from the Andal King Armistead Vance.\n\nThe castle is the location of [[Robb Stark]]'s great victory over [[House Lannister]] and the site of his crowning. By the end of the ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'', [[Brynden Tully]] surrenders the castle to [[Jaime Lannister]] to spare further bloodshed. Riverrun then passed into the hands of Emmon Frey, an ally of House Lannister.<ref>http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Feast_for_Crows-Chapter_38</ref>\n\n====The Twins====\nThe Twins are a heavily fortified set of castles that control movement over the river.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The Twins is the seat of [[House Frey]], and they have grown wealthy by charging a toll on all those who cross for the past six centuries. Because the Freys are both wealthy and numerous, they are one of the most powerful houses sworn to [[House Tully]]. The castle's strategic position gives House Frey enormous importance in times of war.\n\nWhen Robb Stark goes to The Twins to repair his alliance with House Frey, the Freys massacre Robb and his army: an event known as \"The Red Wedding\", and contrary to native customs of [[hospitality#Celtic cultures|guest right]]. This won them the enmity of most of the Seven Kingdoms, especially in the Riverlands and North.\n\n===The Vale of Arryn===\n[[File:Meteore.jpg|thumb|For the TV adaptation, images of the Greek rock formations of [[Meteora]] were used for the composite views of the Vale.]]\n\nThe Vale is the area surrounded almost completely by the Mountains of the Moon in the east of Westeros. The Vale is under the rulership of [[House Arryn]], one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility and formerly Kings of Mountain and Vale. Their seat, the Eyrie, is a castle high in the mountains, small but considered unassailable. The only way to reach the Vale is by a mountain road teeming with animals called 'shadowcats', rock slides, and dangerous mountain clans. The mountain road ends at the Vale's sole entrance, the Bloody Gate: a pair of twin watchtowers, connected by a covered bridge, on the rocky mountain slopes over a very narrow path. The protection of the surrounding mountains gives the Vale itself a temperate climate, fertile meadows, and woods. The snowmelt from the mountains and a constant waterfall that never freezes, named Alyssa's Tears, provide plentiful water. The Vale has rich black soil, wide slow-moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes. Illegitimate children born in the Vale are given the surname Stone.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\n====The Eyrie====\n[[File:Schloss Neuschwanstein 2013.jpg|thumbnail|The German [[Neuschwanstein Castle|castle of Neuschwanstein]], on which the Eyrie is based]]\n\nBased on the German castle of [[Neuschwanstein]],<ref group=S>{{cite web | url=http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/ssm/category/heraldry/p435/P615 | title=So Spake Martin: KEPLER\u2019S AND CODY\u2019S SIGNINGS (CALIFORNIA; NOVEMBER 9 AND 11) | author=George R.

It is situated on the Giant's Lance and reachable only by a narrow mule trail, guarded by the Gates of the Moon and three small castles, titled Stone, Snow, and Sky. Travelers must enter the Gates of the Moon and its upper bailey before reaching the narrow path up the mountain. The steps up the Giant's Lance starts directly behind the Gates of the Moon. The Eyrie clings to the mountain and is six hundred feet above Sky. The last part of the climb to the Eyrie is something of a cross between a chimney and a stone ladder, which leads to the Eyrie's cellar entrance. Due to the Mountains of the Moon's harsh winters, travel to and from the Eyrie is possible through the mountains only in summer.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Eyrie is the smallest of the great castles in the story, consisting of seven slim towers bunched tightly together. It has no stables, kennels, or smithies, but the towers can house 500 men, and the [[granary]] can sustain a small household for a year or more. The Eyrie does not keep livestock on hand; all dairy produce, meats, fruits, vegetables, etc., must be brought from the Vale below. Its cellars hold six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies and occasionally guests from below, with [[oxen]] are used to raise and lower them. Winter snows can make supplying the fortress impossible. The Eyrie's dungeons, known as \"sky cells\", are left open to the sky on one side and have sloping floors that put prisoners in danger of slipping or rolling off the edge. Executions in the Eyrie are carried out via the Moon Door, which opens from the high hall onto a 600-foot drop.\n\nThe Eyrie is made of pale stone and primarily decorated with the blue and white colors of House Arryn. Elegant details provide warmth and comfort through plentiful fireplaces, carpets, and luxurious fabrics. Many of the chambers have been described to be warm and comfortable, with magnificent views of the Vale, the Mountains of the Moon, or the waterfall. The Maiden's Tower is the easternmost of the seven slender towers, so all the Vale can be seen from its windows and balconies. The apartments of the Lady of the Eyrie open over a small garden planted with blue flowers and ringed by white towers, containing grass and scattered statuary, with the central statue of a weeping woman believed to be Alyssa Arryn, around low, flowering shrubs. The lord's chambers have doors of solid oak, and plush [[velvet]] curtains covering windows of small rhomboid panes of glass. The High Hall has a blue silk carpet leading to the carved weirwood thrones of the Lord and Lady Arryn. The floors and walls are of milk-white marble veined with blue. Daylight enters down through high narrow arched windows along the eastern wall, and there are some fifty high iron sconces where torches may be lit.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Eyrie was held by Lord Jon Arryn, who fostered Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon prior to Robert's Rebellion. After the war, Lord Arryn served as King Robert I Baratheon's Hand of the King (prime minister). After Lord Arryn was assassinated, his wife, Lady Lysa Arryn, took her sickly child, Robin, and fled to the Eyrie. Lysa refused to align herself with any of the claimants during the War of the Five Kings, but eventually pretends to a possible alliance with House Lannister after Lord Petyr Baelish agrees to marry her. Later Baelish kills Lysa after she attempts to murder her niece, Sansa Stark. As of ''Feast for Crows'', Baelish rules in the Eyrie as the Lord Protector and Regent for the sickly, epileptic Lord Robert \"Robin\" Arryn, and plans for Sansa to marry Harold Harding, who will become heir to the Eyrie and the Vale in the event of young Robin Arryn's death.<ref>''A Feast for Crows'', Chapter 41, Alayne</ref>\n\nFor the CGI compositions of the Vale of Arryn in the TV series, as seen in the establishing shot of the Eyrie and from the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of [[Meteora]]. Initially they had been considering the [[Wulingyuan|Zhangjiajie Mountains]] in China, but because the landscape base plates were shot in Northern Ireland, using Meteora resulted a better option.<ref group=S name=btlnews_bluebolt/> Set designer Gemma Jackson said, \"A lot of the mosaics in the Eyrie were based on a beautiful chapel I visited in Rome.\"<ref group=S name=dailybeast_secrets/> The interior of the High Hall of the Arryns was filmed at The Paint Hall, occupying one of the four soundstages there. Martin acknowledged that the set differed significantly from its presentation in the books: \"In the books, the room is long and rectangular. But [The Paint Hall soundstage] had essentially a square space, which they chose to put a round hall in, with a staircase curving up to a throne that was high above.\"<ref group=S name=aoltv_qa/>\n\n===The Westerlands===\nThe Westerlands are the Westerosi lands to the west of the Riverlands and north of the Reach. They are ruled by House Lannister of Casterly Rock, formerly Kings of the Rock. People of this region are often called \"Westermen.\" Lannisport, lying hard by Casterly Rock, is the chief town of the region and one of the great ports and cities of Westeros. The Westerlands are rich in precious metals, mostly gold, which is the source of their wealth.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}} illegitimate children born in the Westerlands are given the surname Hill.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Prologue, p. 12}}\n\n====Casterly Rock====\n[[File:Rock of Gibraltar northwest.jpg|thumb|Casterly Rock was inspired by the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] (pictured).]]\n\nA stronghold carved from a mountain overlooking the harbor city of Lannisport and the sea beyond, Casterly Rock is the ancestral seat of House Lannister. According to popular legend, the hero known as Lann the Clever tricked the Casterlys into giving up the Rock, and took it for himself. The Rock is renowned as the wealthiest region due to its abundance of gold mining resources, and it is one of the strongest castles of the Seven Kingdoms. It has never been taken in battle, despite attacks by the Iron Islanders and the plans of Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings.  It was held by [[House Lannister#Tywin|Lord Tywin Lannister]] before the [[War of the Five Kings]], but after his death, Queen Regent [[House Lannister#Cersei|Cersei Lannister]] made one of her cousins [[castellan]] of the castle. As of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', the narrative has not actually taken place in Casterly Rock, yet descriptions of it have been offered by the Lannisters in the POV chapters.\n\nWest of Casterly Rock is the coastal city of Lannisport. A busy port under the governance of the Lannisters of Casterly Rock, Lannisport thrives as a protected and wealthy city. The city is also home to many lesser Lannisters and other people with similar surnames, such as Lannys.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin stated on his blog that he drew inspiration for Casterly Rock from the [[Rock of Gibraltar]].<ref group=S name=grrm_blog_080529/>\n\n===The Reach===\n[[File:Castillo de Almodovar (11801978016).jpg|thumb|The [[Castle of Almod\u00f3var del R\u00edo]] in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, which represented Highgarden in ''Game of Thrones'']]\n\nThe Reach is the most lush and fertile region of Westeros, ruled by [[House Tyrell]] from Highgarden. The Tyrells were stewards to House Gardener, the Kings of the Reach before Aegon's conquest. After the last Gardener King was killed on the Field of Fire, the Tyrells surrendered Highgarden to Aegon and were rewarded with both the castle and the position of overlords of the Reach. The wealth and power of the Reach comes from their bountiful harvests of the most sought-after wines and foods. During times of war, the lengthy distance of the Reach and its abundance of foods protects their inhabitants from initial famine and sickness. In a significant political maneuver during the civil war in Westeros and the War of the Five Kings, House Tyrell provides the starving populace of King's Landing with hundreds of carts of food, ensuring the positive image of House Tyrell foremost, and the alliance for the Iron Throne with House Baratheon as secondary. However, the Tyrells were responsible for the starvation in the first place, as part of their plan to help Renly usurp the Iron Throne. The most prominent city in the Reach is Oldtown. It is the oldest city in Westeros, home to the Maester's Citadel, and the previous seat of the Faith of the Seven.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Illegitimate children born in the Reach are given the surname Flowers.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\n====Oldtown====\n[[File:PHAROS2013-3000x2250.jpg|thumb|The Hightower of Oldtown bears similarities to the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (3D reconstruction pictured)]]\n\nOldtown is one of the largest cities in Westeros and is by far the oldest, built by the First Men before the Andal Invasion. It survived the invasion by welcoming the Andals rather than resisting them. The city is located in the southwestern part of Westeros, at the mouth of the River Honeywine, where it opens onto Whispering Sound and the Sunset Sea beyond.\n\nOldtown is primarily known as the location of the Citadel, home of the order of Maesters who serve as councillors, doctors, scientists, and postmasters for the Seven Kingdoms. The city's Starry Sept was the seat of the Faith of the Seven until the construction of the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing. Aegon the Conqueror's reign is dated from his entrance into the city of Oldtown and his acknowledgment as king by the High Septon.\n\nOldtown is the second most important port in the Seven Kingdoms after King's Landing: trading ships from the Summer Islands, the Free Cities, the eastern cities, and the rest of Westeros constantly crowd into its harbors. The city itself is described as stunningly beautiful. Many rivers and canals crisscross its cobbled streets, and breathtaking stone mansions are common. The city lacks the squalor of King's Landing, which usurped its position as the preeminent city of Westeros.\n\nThe largest structure in the city, and the tallest structure in Westeros, is the Hightower, a massive [[ziggurat|stepped lighthouse]] which extends some {{convert|800|ft}} into the sky and is topped by a huge beacon which can be seen for many miles out to sea. Oldtown is ruled from the Hightower by House Hightower. Originally kings in their own right, they later swore fealty to the Gardeners of Highgarden, and became vassals of the Tyrells after the Conquest. The Hightowers are known for their loyalty and stalwartness. The current ruler of the city is Lord Leyton Hightower.\n\nOldtown remained aloof from the [[War of the Five Kings]], but late in the war the Ironborn under King Euron Greyjoy launched a massive raid along the coast, conquering the Shield Islands and parts of the Arbor before trying to blockade the mouth of the Honeywine. An attempt to attack the city harbor was repulsed by the city's defenders. Oldtown remains under threat from the Ironborn.\n\n===The Stormlands===\nThe Stormlands are the Westerosi areas between King's Landing and the Sea of Dorne. In the east they are bordered by Shipbreaker Bay and the Dornish Sea to the south. Before Aegon's conquest they were ruled by the Storm Kings, and afterwards by [[House Baratheon]], bastard relatives to the Targaryens. The Dornish Marches are located within this region, and were common battlegrounds between the Stormlands and Dorne until Dorne joined the Seven Kingdoms.<ref group=S>{{cite web | url=http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Stormlands | title=The Citadel: So Spake Martin, August 5, 2005 | date=August 5, 2005 | website=westeros.org | accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref> Illegitimate children born in the Stormlands are given the surname Storm.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Davos I, p. 161}}\n\n====Storm's End====\nStorm's End is the seat of House Baratheon and, before them, the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings extending back many thousands of years. According to legend, the first Storm King in the age of the First Men was Durran, who married Elenei, the daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. In a rage her parents sent vast storms to shatter his keep and kill his wedding guests and family; whereupon Durran declared war against the gods and raised several castles over Shipbreaker Bay, each larger and more formidable than the last. Finally, the seventh castle stayed in place and resisted the storms. Some believe the Children of the Forest took a hand in its construction; others that Brandon Stark, the builder of the Wall, advised Durran on its construction. The truth of the matter is unknown.\n\nStorm's End has never fallen to either siege or storm. Its outer defenses consist of a huge curtain wall, {{convert|100|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|40|ft}} thick on its thinnest side, nearly {{convert|80|ft}} thick on its seaward side. The wall consists of a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble. The wall is smooth and curving, the stones so well placed that the wind cannot enter. On the seaward side, there is a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} drop below the wall into the sea.\n\nThe castle itself consists of one huge drum tower crowned with formidable battlements, and so large that it can comfortably contain stables, [[barracks]], [[armory (military)|armory]] and lord's chambers in the same structure. Although never taken in battle, Storm's End has endured several sieges and battles in recent history. The last Storm King, Argilac the Arrogant, abandoned his impressive defenses to meet the Targaryen commander, Orys Baratheon, in open battle during Aegon Targaryen's War of Conquest, and lost. This led to Orys Baratheon marrying Argilac's daughter and becoming Lord of Storm's End.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, Storm's End was besieged for a year by the host of Lord Mace Tyrell, who commanded the landward forces, while Paxter Redwyne's fleet of the Arbor kept the castle cut off by sea. Stannis Baratheon, commanding the defense, refused to yield and his men were reduced to eating rats. A smuggler named Davos ran the blockade to resupply the castle and Stannis rewarded him by knighting him and giving him lands, thus founding House Seaworth, but he also cut off the fingertips of his left hand as punishment for all his previous smuggling. After the war, Stannis was furious when his brother Robert, now king, gave the castle to their younger brother Renly and placed Stannis in command of Dragonstone. This led to many years of bitterness on Stannis' part.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Storm's End supported Renly when he treacherously attempted to usurp the crown, and was besieged by Stannis. When the castellan, Cortnay Penrose, refused to yield even after Renly's death, he was killed by Stannis' ally, the priestess Melisandre, and the castle surrendered. Later, the castle was besieged by a strong army under Mace Tyrell, but he abandoned the siege after a few weeks to return to King's Landing after the arrest of his daughter Margaery by the High Septon. As of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', the castle remains in the hands of Stannis Baratheon.\n\nAt the end of ''A Dance with Dragons'' an army lands in the Stormlands led by Jon Connington and a young man claiming to be Aegon Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell and heir to the Iron Throne. To attract support, Aegon plans to conquer Storm\u2019s End and raise the banner of House Targaryen above the battlements.\n\nIn the TV adaptation, scenes in the Stormlands were filmed in [[Larrybane]], Northern Ireland. The scene where Stannis' red priestess Melisandre gave birth to a shadow creature was filmed in the [[Cushendun Caves]], also in Northern Ireland.<ref group=S name=Skyscanner/>\n\n===The Crownlands===\nThe Crownlands are the lands in Westeros surrounding King's Landing, ruled directly by the crown of the Iron Throne. The Targaryen kings consolidated this as one of the nine regions of Westeros, after their conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, from sparsely populated pieces of the Riverlands and Stormlands. The Crownlands form the entire coastline of Blackwater Bay, and include the original Targaryen homeland on the island of Dragonstone, at the Narrow Sea entrance to Blackwater Bay. Besides King's Landing, which is the largest city in Westeros, the Crownlands include many towns and castles. The illegitimate children born in the Crownlands are given the surname Waters.\n\n====Dragonstone====\n{{multiple image |footer=[[Downhill Strand]], [[County Londonderry]] was used to represent a beach of the island of Dragonstone (left) and [[Gaztelugatxe]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Spain (right) stood in for Dragonstone in Season 7. |image1=Downhill Strand, Derry - Londonderry - geograph.org.uk - 222956.jpg |image2=Gaztelugatxe_4199995260.jpg}}\n\nDragonstone was once the westernmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of Valyria. A century before the Doom, the Targaryen family was sent to Dragonstone to rule there. When the Doom came upon Valyria, House Targaryen survived along with the last of the Valyrian dragons. Another century later, Aegon Targaryen and his sisters Rhaenys and Visenya launched a massive campaign of conquest from the island and eventually conquered all of Westeros except for Dorne, and North of the Wall. Aegon's progeny reigned as kings of the Seven Kingdoms for centuries.\n\nDragonstone is a massive, forbidding fortress, taking up a large portion of the island of the same name. The castle is unique in that the builders and sorcerers of Valyria carved its towers and keeps into the shapes of dragons and made ferocious [[gargoyle]]s to cover its walls using both magic and masonry. The castle's lower levels are warmed by residual volcanic activity deep below the keep. There is a small port and town outside of the castle.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, before the sack of King's Landing, the Targaryen Queen Rhaella, who was pregnant, and her son Viserys were sent to Dragonstone along with part of the Targaryen fleet and a garrison of loyal soldiers. But after King's Landing fell, Robert Baratheon dispatched his brother Stannis to take the island stronghold. After a storm destroyed the royalist fleet, the Targaryen garrison tried to betray Viserys and his newborn sister, Daenerys, to Stannis (the queen had died in childbirth). But Targaryen loyalists led by Ser Willem Darry took the children away. Stannis conquered Dragonstone easily, and King Robert granted him ownership of the castle. Stannis took this a slight because his younger brother Renly then inherited Storm's End, the ancient seat of House Baratheon. Ser Axell Florent, one of the uncles of Stannis' wife Selyse Florent, acted as castellan.\n\nUpon Robert's death, Stannis declared himself King of Westeros and condemned the queen's children as bastards born of [[incest]], as he had discovered with Jon Arryn. Dragonstone became his main seat. He returned there after the disastrous Battle of the Blackwater. His councilor, the red priestess Melisandre of Asshai, tried to convince him to let her raise the \"stone dragon\" of the castle through blood magic, but Lord Davos Seaworth convinced Stannis to go north to the Wall to help the Night's Watch instead. After Stannis abandoned Dragonstone, leaving the Bastard of Nightsong Rolland Storm as castellan, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister dispatched a fleet to barricade it. However, Ser Loras Tyrell, impatient to free the fleet to protect his home castle of Highgarden, attacked Dragonstone directly. He took the castle but lost a thousand men and was himself reportedly gravely wounded. As of ''A Dance with Dragons'', Dragonstone is now controlled by troops loyal to House Tyrell, and theoretically, once again under control of the Iron Throne.\n\nOne scene set at Dragonstone, in which Stannis burns wooden sculptures of the Seven gods, was filmed at the beach of [[Downhill Strand]].<ref group=S name=utv_beach/> In [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|Season 7]] of the show, filming for Dragonstone took place at several locations in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque region]] of Spain: the islet of [[Gaztelugatxe]] in [[Bermeo]], Itzurun Beach in [[Zumaia]], and Muriola Beach in [[Barrika]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Oliver Smith | title=Dragonstone's beautiful beach from Game of Thrones is real \u2013 here's how to get there | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/arts-and-culture/filming-locations-game-of-thrones-season-seven/ | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | accessdate=July 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====King's Landing====\n{{multiple image |footer=[[Mdina]] in Malta (left) and [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia (right) stood in for King's Landing in the TV adaptation. |image1=Mdina, Malta - panoramio (18).jpg |image2=Dubrovnik from walls.JPG}}\n\nKing's Landing is the royal capital of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms. King's Landing has an estimated population of 500,000, making it the most populous city in Westeros.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, p. 528}} It is situated on the Blackwater river on the spot where Aegon the Conqueror landed in Westeros to begin his conquest. The main city is surrounded by a wall, which is manned by the City Watch of King's Landing, which is nicknamed the gold cloaks, after the cloaks they wear. Within the walls, the city's natural landscape is dominated by three hills, named after Aegon and his two sister-wives Rhaenys and Visenya. Poorer smallfolk (commoners) build shanty settlements outside the city. King's Landing is described as extremely populous but unsightly and dirty. The stench of the city's waste can be smelled far beyond its walls.\n\nThe royal castle, called the Red Keep, sits on Aegon's Hill. It is the seat of the [[royal court]]. The Keep holds the Iron Throne. Aegon commissioned the throne's construction from the swords of his defeated enemies. According to legend, he kept the blades sharp because he believed that no ruler should ever sit comfortably. Centuries later, kings still cut themselves on the throne. It is a common belief that one who cuts himself on the throne has been \"rejected\" by the throne and is therefore not fit to rule.\n\nThe city also holds the Great Sept of Baelor, where the Most Devout convene with the High Septon. It is the holiest sept of the Seven. The slums of King's Landing are called Flea Bottom, where residents are so poor they regularly subsist on [[Perpetual stew|\"bowls of brown\"]], a mystery stew that can include the meat of puppies and murder victims.\n\nMartin compared King's Landing to medieval Paris or London.<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/> It was inspired by the view of [[Staten Island]] from his childhood home in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]].<ref group=S>[http://abc.go.com/shows/world-news-with-diane-sawyer/listing/2014-04/18-wn-418-games-of-thrones-author-george-rr-martin Interview of George RR Martin on the April 18, 2014 episode of ''ABC World News Tonight''] {{webarchive | url=https://archive.is/20140427183405/http://abc.go.com/shows/world-news-with-diane-sawyer/listing/2014-04/18-wn-418-games-of-thrones-author-george-rr-martin | date=April 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first season of the TV adaptation used Malta's former capital [[Mdina]] to represent King's Landing.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> \"Like King's Landing, Mdina is a walled medieval city built upon a hill, but unlike King's Landing, Mdina is an inland city\u2014so the production was limited to interior shots such as side streets and the [[Mdina Gate|town gate]], which can be seen when Ned Stark arrives.

As of the first five books, Doran Nymeros Martell is the Prince of Dorne and Lord of Sunspear. Doran's sister, Princess Elia, was married in a political alliance to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne. They had two children, a daughter, Rhaenys and a son, Aegon. During the Sack of King's Landing at the end of Robert's Rebellion, Princess Elia was raped and murdered by Gregor Clegane, a House Lannister bannerman (vassal). Her children were also killed in front of her. Prince Doran and his wife, Princess Mellaria, have three children, Arianne, Quentyn and Trystane. During the War of the Five Kings, Tyrion Lannister, as Hand of the King, turns the historical enmity of House Martell and Dorne into an alliance by sending King Joffrey's middle sibling and sister, Myrcella Baratheon, as the betrothed future bride to Trystane, the youngest child of Prince Doran, who is about her own age. The eldest child of Prince Doran, Arianne, is heir to House Martell, Sunspear and the rule of Dorne. The wealth of Dorne comes from their famous Sand Steeds, purebred horses of endurance, speed and grace, and from spices, wines, fishing, fabrics and textiles.\n\nDorne is bordered by the Sea of Dorne to the north, the islands known as the Stepstones to the east, and stretches from the high mountains of the Dornish marches, the Red Mountains, separating Dorne from the remainder of the Seven Kingdoms by land. The two major passes though the Red Mountains that connect Dorne with the rest of the continent are the Stone Way Pass and the Prince's Pass. The Prince\u2019s Pass leads to the Reach, while the Stone Way exits the mountains near Summerhall. The southern coast of the continent is bordered by the Summer Sea.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Described as tropical in climate by George R. R. Martin,<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/> Dorne has the highest temperatures kingdom in Westeros, is arid, with a rocky, mountainous, terrain that includes the only desert on the continent. Its rivers provide some fertile lands and during a long summer there is enough rain and other supplies of water to keep Dorne habitable. Inland water is almost as valuable as gold, and wells are jealously guarded. Notable locations of Dorne are Starfall, the seat of House Dayne, and Yronwood, the seat of House Yronwood, the most powerful of the Martell bannermen. Planky Town is a trade port town at the mouth of the River Greenblood.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nDornishmen have a reputation for hot-bloodedness. They differ both culturally and ethnically from other Westerosi due to the historical mass immigration of Rhoynish people. They have adopted many Rhoynish customs as well, including [[equal primogeniture]]. Dorne was the only kingdom in Westeros to successfully resist Aegon's conquest, even killing one of his dragons during the war. It was conquered by Daeron I over a century after the Targaryen invasion, but rose against him leading to his death. Finally under Daeron's cousin Daeron II they joined through marriage. This accomplishment has allowed Dorne to retain a measure of independence. Lords of the ruling [[House Martell]] still style themselves \"Prince\" and \"Princess\" in the Rhoynish fashion. Unlike most of the rest of Westeros, illegitimate children born in Dorne are treated nearly the same as legal offspring{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and given the surname Sand,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, pp. 520\u2013521}} as with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\nAccording to ''A Storm of Swords'', \"There were three sorts of Dornishmen [...]. There were the salty Dornishmen who lived along the coasts, the sandy Dornishmen of the deserts and long river valleys, and the stony Dornishmen who made their fastnesses in the passes and heights of the Red Mountains. The salty Dornishmen had the most Rhoynish blood, the stony Dornishmen the least. All three sorts seemed well represented in Doran\u2019s retinue. The salty Dornishmen were lithe and dark, with smooth olive skin and long black hair streaming in the wind. The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. They wound long bright scarfs around their helms to ward off sunstroke. The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest, sons of the Andals and the First Men, brownhaired or blond, with faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning.\"{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, pp. 520\u2013521}}\n\nIn the show, Dornish scenes were filmed in the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], [[Seville, Spain]].\n\n===Summer Sea===\n\n====Basilisk Isles====\nEast of Naath, the Basilisk Isles have been a festering sore of the Summer Sea, and a safe haven for pirates, slavers, sellswords, and outlaws. Ruins have been found on the Isle of Tears, the Isle of Toads, and Ax Island. The Isle of Tears is the largest island, with steep valleys and black bogs. It was conquered by the Ghiscari and it was called Gorgai for two centuries, until the dragonlords of Valyria captured it and renamed it Gorgossos. It was used as a prison by the Freehold, a place where they sent their most despicable criminals.\n\n====Naath====\nNaath, also known as the Isle of Butterflies, is an island of the north-west coast of Sothoryos that lies east of the Basilisk Isles. The Naathi people have dark skin and golden eyes. They practice extreme pacifism, making music instead of war and refusing to eat meat, only fruit. This makes them especially vulnerable to slavers from Essos. Daenerys' interpreter [[Missandei]] is from Naath.\n\n====Summer Islands {{anchor|Summer Islands|The Summer Islands}}====\nAs indicated on a map in ''A Storm of Swords'', the Summer Islands are situated to the south of Westeros,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} with a local fauna of talking birds,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Sansa II, p. 302}} apes,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Arya II, p. 86}} and monkeys.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Brienne III, p. 300}} The novels describe the island natives as dark-skinned people who speak their own language.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 11}} They wear colored feathery clothes{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Sansa II, p. 294}}{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} and live on fruit and fish.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell V, p. 965}} From their port city named Tall Trees Town,{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u2013752}} the Summer Isles export rare goods to Westeros such as wine,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Tyrion II, p. 121}} spices,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Prologue, pp. 20\u201321}} feathers,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, pp. 172\u2013173}} but also a special kind of wood from which bows are made that have a longer range than most others.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 8}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Griffin Reborn, p. 801}} People of the Seven Kingdoms call the Summer Islanders' great vessels ''swan ships'', \"for their billowing white sails and for their figureheads, most of which depicted birds\".{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u201375}} Samwell Tarly, who spends two chapters in ''A Feast for Crows'' aboard a swan ship, describes the Summer Islander women as wanton, and their gods as strange; they \"revered the elderly and celebrated their dead\" through sexual intercourse.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u2013752}} As a prostitute explains to Tyrion in ''A Clash of Kings'', the Summer Islanders regard their sexuality as the gods' gift to worship them through mating, and hence many of their highborn youths and maidens serve in pleasure houses for a few years to honor the gods.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Tyrion III, p. 238}}\n\n==Essos==\nPart of the narrative in ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' lies across the Narrow sea from Westeros, an area comprising the large eastern continent named Essos. Being roughly the size of [[Eurasia]],<ref group=S name=ssm_geography/> Essos has geography and climate that vary greatly. The western coastline is characterized by green rolling hills, the massive Forest of [[#Qohor|Qohor]], and extensive island chains such as [[#Braavos|Braavos]] and [[#Lys|Lys]]. The middle of the continent is covered by the flat grasslands of the Dothraki Sea and the arid lands known as the Red Waste to the east. Beyond the Red Waste lies the city of Qarth. The south is dominated by dry rolling hills and has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with a coastline along the Summer Sea and [[#Slaver's Bay|Slaver's Bay]]. The north coast of the mainland is separated from the polar cap by the Shivering Sea. To the south, across the Summer Sea, lies the uncharted jungle continent of Sothoryos.<ref group=S name=hbo_viewersguide_map/>\n\nMuch of the fictional history of Essos relates to Valyria, a city located on a peninsula in southern Essos and the origin of [[House Targaryen]] before the destruction of the Valyrian Empire in an unspecified cataclysm.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}}{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Targaryen, p. 832}} After the destruction of Valyria, the cities of Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen regained independence and ruled their respective areas as [[city-states]]. The area is known in the books as Slaver's Bay.\n\n===Free Cities and vicinity {{anchor|The Free Cities|Free Cities|Andalos|Rhoyne}}===\nAcross the narrow sea on the western side of Essos lie the nine Free Cities, independent city-states that are mostly on islands or along the coast. They are Lys, Myr, Pentos, Braavos, Lorath, Norvos, Qohor, Volantis and Tyrosh. Although most Free Cities are named early in the first novel,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys I, pp. 30\u201331}} the books only provide a map of this region in ''A Dance with Dragons''. Mountains to the east separate the coast from the plains of the [[#The Dothraki Sea|Dothraki Sea]], though gaps in the mountain range provide the Dothraki people some access to the Free Cities. The Free Cities were colonies built by the ancient Valyrian Freehold, and later declared independence after the Doom of Valyria.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} An exception to this is Braavos, which was founded by refugees fleeing Valyrian expansion, escaped slaves and other rabble.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} The languages of the Free Cities are derivatives of [[Valyrian languages|High Valyrian]].{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 102\u2013104}}\n\nThe Free Cities span an area characterized by the river Rhoyne, which the local character Yandry describes as \"the greatest river in the world\".{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion IV, p. 182}} Its banks are the homeland of the Rhoynar, who worship the river as \"Mother Rhoyne\".{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Queenmaker, p. 436}} As mapped in ''A Dance with Dragons'', the Rhoyne originates from the conjunction of two of its tributaries, the Upper Rhoyne and the Little Rhoyne, southeast of the ruins of Ghoyan Drohe. The headwaters of the Upper Rhoyne lie in Andalos, the homeland of the Andals between Braavos and Pentos.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The Rhoyne's course runs southeast to turn due south after Dagger Lake, where river pirates hide on and around the many lake islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion IV, pp. 187\u2013189}} The Rhoyne gains in width considerably as it gets fed by more tributaries, until it opens into the Summer Sea in a delta near the Free City of Volantis.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}}\n\n====Braavos====\nUnique among the Free Cities, Braavos was not a Valyrian colony, but a secret refuge from Valyrian expansion.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} It is a city spread over hundreds of tiny islands,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon V, p. 447}} which are located in a lagoon on the northwestern end of Essos where the Narrow Sea and Shivering Sea meet.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} Braavos is known for its swashbuckling bravos{{clarify|date=November 2015}} and its mysterious assassins, the Faceless Men. It is also famed for the Titan of Braavos, both a fortress and a statue. The ruler of Braavos is known as the Sealord and it is from the sea that the city's power and wealth flows. The hulls of Braavosi ships are painted purple{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} and their merchant ships sail to many distant lands and bring their trade and wealth back home.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Arya IV, pp. 530\u2013531}} Braavos has many moneylenders and the Iron Bank of Braavos lends money to foreign nations, including the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nBraavosi dress in flashy colors while the very rich and powerful dress in black and in blues that are almost black. Officials of Braavos, called keyholders and justiciars, wear drab coats of brown or grey.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The city is also renowned worldwide for its [[courtesan]]s. Every courtesan has her own barge and servants to work them. The beauty of famed courtesans has inspired many a song. They are showered with gifts from goldsmiths and craftsmen beg for their custom. Nobility and rich merchants pay the courtesans large amounts of money to appear alongside them at events, and bravos are known to kill each other in their names.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The character Syrio Forel, former first sword of the Sealord of Braavos, introduces Arya Stark to a unique form of Braavosi sword fighting, called Water Dancing.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Arya IV, pp. 530\u2013531}} The style is a refined form of fencing in which the practitioner stands sideways and wields a slender blade.

The worship of [[R'hllor]] is the most influential religion of Volantis, especially among slaves.\n\nThe TV adaptation used locations in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], Spain.\n\n====Other Free Cities {{anchor|Lorath|Lys|Myr|Norvos|Qohor|Tyrosh|Volantis}}====\n* Lorath is a port city on a group of northern islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The character [[Jaqen H'ghar]] poses as a Lorathi in ''A Clash of Kings'', wearing long hair dyed red on one side and white on the other.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Arya II, p. 86}}\n* Lys sits astride a series of southern islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The Lysene have a tendency to be tall and fair of skin and eyes, unlike most inhabitants of the Free Cities. Lys is well known for its pleasure houses, training slaves in the arts of love and selling them as concubines and bed-slaves. Lys also frequently fights over control of the Stepstones and the Disputed Lands. There appears to be a love goddess whose worship is peculiar to Lys.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Dany's handmaiden Doreah and the pirate Salladhor Saan are Lysene.\n* Myr is a coastal city renowned for their master lenscrafters, intricate lace, and fine carpets. The dark eyed and dark skinned Myrmen are similar to Norvosi and Pentoshi in that they are ruled by magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. Myr is a hub of trade in both slaves and their signature green nectar wines. Myr frequently fights over control of the Disputed Lands.\n* Norvos sits on the main continent in two parts, one atop a high hill and the other beside a low river. The city has three large bells, each with its own name and distinctive voice, that are rung frequently. The surrounding area is a land of rolling hills, terraced farms, and white-stucco villages. The climate is fairly mild. Norvosi can be recognized by their dyed and upswept mustaches. The city is run by a council of magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. It is also home to a group of bearded priests that train elite guardsmen. These guardsmen swear oaths of duty and consider themselves wedded to their distinctive long axes.\n* Qohor is situated on the main continent, in the vast Forest of Qohor. It is known for its fine tapestries and its smiths, who have the rare ability to reforge Valyrian steel, even directly infusing the metal with a variety of different colors. The Black Goat is a prominent god in the city. Qohor's city guard has been composed solely of Unsullied eunuch slave soldiers ever since the Battle of the Three Thousand, when 3,000 Unsullied soldiers successfully defended the city against over 25,000 Dothraki horsemen. Guardsmen tie braids of human hair to their spears to commemorate the Dothraki cutting their braids in salute to Qohor's defenders.\n* Tyrosh, a coastal city-state ruled by an Archon, is infamous for its avarice. Traders deal extensively in slaves and Tyroshi pear brandy. The city features an abundance of pleasure houses, but they are not as highly regarded as those in Lys. Tyroshi master armorsmiths make intricate armor in fantastic shapes. Tyrosh is a popular center for the hiring of sellswords. The city is often drawn into the ongoing conflicts over the Disputed Lands and the Stepstones. The Tyroshi often wear forked beards and pointed mustaches dyed in bright colors. The character Daario Naharis is from Tyrosh.\n\n===Central Essos===\nThis section covers the Essos locations east of the Free Cities that Daenerys Targeryen passes through on her travels in ''A Game of Thrones'' and ''A Clash of Kings'' before moving on to Slaver's Bay.\n\n==== Valyria ====\nValyria is a peninsula in South-Central Essos, west of Slaver's Bay. Before the Doom of Valyria, it was the seat of the Valyrian Freehold, a massive empire thousands of years old. The Valyrians are characterized by their silver hair and violet eyes. Valyria was called The Freehold because every man who owned land was allowed to vote for their leaders. The Valyrians also used slaves to mine the Fourteen Flames, a series of volcanoes rich with ore. They subjugated the Ghiscari and the Rhoynar and established all of the Free Cities, save Braavos. They did this through their knowledge of dragonlore. Many Valyrians rode dragons. However, hundreds of years ago, an event known as the Doom of Valyria, apparently involving a violent eruption of the Fourteen Flames, destroyed the Freehold and made Valyria an archipelago. The Targaryens are of the blood of old Valyria, who escaped before The Doom.\n\n====Dothraki Sea {{anchor|The Dothraki Sea|Dothraki Sea|Vaes Dothrak}}====\nThe Dothraki Sea is a vast, flat grassland on Essos. It is inhabited by the Dothraki people, a copper-skinned race of warlike nomads with their [[Dothraki language|own language]] and unique culture. The Dothraki live in hordes called khalasars, each led by a chief called a khal. Khalasars are broken into groups, called khas, which are each led by one of the khal's captains, called kos. Each khal and his khalasar owe fealty to a ruling council of royal priestesses, called the dosh khaleen, whose members are each a former khal's consort, called a khaleesi during the reign of her husband, one who became part of the dosh khaleen following his death.\n\nDothraki are expert riders and their horses are of prime importance in their culture, used for food, transportation, raw materials, warfare, and establishing social standing. They regularly raid other peoples.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin said \"The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures ... Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes ... seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy. So any resemblance to Arabs or Turks is coincidental. Well, except to the extent that the [historic] Turks were also originally horsemen of the steppes, not unlike the Alans, Huns, and the rest.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/> However, he also noted that \"In general, though, while I do draw inspiration from history, I try to avoid direct one-for-one transplants, [so] it would not be correct to say that the Dothraki are Mongols.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\nThe Dothraki have only one permanent city, called Vaes Dothrak, which serves as their capital. The dosh khaleen hold the city as their seat. It is filled with statues stolen from other cities the Dothraki conquered or raided. There is a law that no Dothraki may shed blood within the boundaries of Vaes Dothrak and that those who do are cursed. Two gigantic bronze stallions, whose hooves meet midair, form an arch above the entryway to the city.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> For the first season of the TV adaptation, Sandy Brae in the [[Mourne Mountains]] of Northern Ireland was chosen to stand in for Vaes Dothrak; the bronze stallions making up the Horse Gate as the main entrance of Vaes Dothrak were later [[Computer-generated imagery|C.G.I.ed]] on two pedestals erected on location.<ref group=S name=mogot_swarming/>\n\n====Lhazar====\nLhazar is an area of the semi-arid lands south of the Dothraki Sea. A region of pastures and hills, it is inhabited by the Lhazareen, a peaceful people with bronze skin, flat faces, and almond eyes. They are predominantly shepherds, called the Lamb Men by the Dothraki, who frequently prey on them. They worship a god called the Great Shepherd and believe that all of humanity is part of a single flock.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33360758 | title=A Game of Thrones | author=George R.

Professional soldiers of all three cities wear outlandish costumes and hairstyles that limit their usefulness in battle. The cities' militaries are highly dependent on additional slave and mercenary armies for the actual fighting.\n\nPresent inhabitants of the bay are a mixed race that no longer speak the old Ghiscari tongue but variations of High Valyrian with a characteristic growl.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} The ancient folk of Ghis, who name themselves the harpy's sons in Astapor, are said to have bristly red-black hair.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} The Good Masters of Astapor all appear alike to Daenerys as \"thick fleshy men with amber skin, broad noses, dark eyes.

The city is similar to Astapor in architecture except for its smaller size and its use of yellow brick in its buildings instead of red. The slavers of Yunkai are known as the Wise Masters. Because of the city's lack of Unsullied, it relies on a mixed professional and slave army of approximately 4,000 with at least 1,000 mercenaries. Typical for Ghiscari, Yunkai soldiers wear impractical armor and oiled hair teased into enormous shapes, limiting their effectiveness.\n\nYunkish scenes were filmed in [[A\u00eft Benhaddou]], Morocco in the TV show.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Skyscanner\"/>\n\n====Meereen====\nThe largest of the three slaver cities, Meereen has a population equaling that of Astapor and Yunkai combined. The city has architecture similar to that of its neighbors, but it is made of bricks of many colors. Its landscape is dominated by a massive pyramid, named the Great Pyramid, and the Temple of Graces, which is capped by a golden dome. Meereen is unique among the Ghiscari cities in that it is filled with many temples and pyramids. The slavers of Meereen are known as the Great Masters. They field a force of lancers equipped in traditionally extravagant Ghiscari fashion with scales of copper and lances as long as fourteen feet. It is built on the banks of the river Skahadhazan.\n\nFor the [[Game of Thrones|HBO television series]], many of the scenes in Meereen were filmed in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and the [[Fortress of Klis]], Croatia. In Season 5, Daznak's Pit in the city was shot in the Plaza de Toros in [[Osuna]], Spain.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Skyscanner\"/>\n\n=== Eastern Essos ===\n\n====Red Waste====\nThe Red Waste is a great desert-like area in the eastern part of Essos.  Not much is known about it, since it was only briefly seen in ''A Clash of Kings'' when Daenerys Targaryen and her ''khalasar'' crossed it. The only known settlement in the region, Vaes Tolorro, is in ruins.\n\n====Qarth====\nFirst mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones'',{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} the city of Qarth has not yet appeared on any maps in the books.

The reader learns through Daenerys's eyes that the city is surrounded by three graded walls of thirty to fifty feet in height, respectively engraved with portraits of animals, war, and lovemaking. The city's buildings are of many different colors, including rose, violet, and [[umber]]. Slender towers rise throughout the city, fountains adorn every square, and thousands of colored birds, blooming trees and flowers fill the city.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} The TV adaptation filmed Qarth on the island of [[Lokrum]] near [[Dubrovnik]] and constructed a set at the Dubac quarry in Croatia to double for the gates of Qarth.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/>\n\nThe Qartheen are described as \"tall pale folk in linen and samite and tiger fur\", with the women wearing gowns that leave one breast bare, while the men sport beaded silk skirts.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} Daenerys perceives them as \"nothing if not polite\".{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Slaves serve their needs.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} The Pureborn, descendants of the city's ancient kings and queens, govern Qarth and also command the city's defenses.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Three principal merchant groups battle amongst themselves and against the Pureborn for dominance of the city: the Thirteen, the Ancient Guild of Spicers, and the Tourmaline Brotherhood.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Qarth's warlocks, whose lips are turned blue from a potion called \"the shade of the evening\", are said to brood over these factions; they are still feared although their power and prestige have waned over the years.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Qarth is also home to the Sorrowful Men, a guild of assassins named so for whispering \"I am so sorry,\" before killing their victims.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Daenerys leaves Qarth again at the end of ''A Clash of Kings''.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 884}}\n\n=== Unvisited lands {{anchor|Other lands|Unvisited lands}} ===\n{{for|Valyria|#Essos{{!}}\u00a7 World and fictional history \u00a7\u00a7 Essos}}\n\n====Asshai and the Shadow Lands {{anchor|Asshai|The Shadow Lands|Asshai and the Shadow Lands}}====\nAsshai and the Shadow Lands are mysterious locations in the ''Ice and Fire'' world.

The Jogos Nhai do not fight between themselves, and live in small clans bound by blood. They live in a state of perpetual war with outsiders. Each tribe is commanded by a ''jhat'', or war chief, and a moonsinger, who is a priestess, healer, and judge. Moonsingers are generally female, and ''jhats'' are mostly male. (Paraphrased from, ''[[The World of Ice & Fire|The World of Ice and Fire]])''\n\n== Sothoros or Sothoryos {{anchor|Sothoryos|Sothoros|Sothyros}}==\nTo the south of Essos lies the continent of Sothoryos,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} also spelled Sothoros in the novels.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 395}} Sothoryos is the third continent of the known world. Sothoros is vast, plague ridden, covered in [[jungle]]s and largely unexplored. It is described as a \"land without end\" by  Jaenara Belaerys, a Valyrian dragonlord from before the Doom of Valyria.\n\nThe continent is first named on a map in ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000), showing the cities of Yeen and Zamettar on it.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} The narrative itself first refers to the continent in ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005).{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}} Martin had described Sothoryos in 2002 as \"the southern continent, roughly equivalent to [[Africa]], jungly, plague-ridden, and largely unexplored\".<ref group=S name=ssm_geographicalinformation/> The novels provide little other information. The swampy nature of Sothoryos is briefly referenced by Victarion in ''A Dance with Dragons'',{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} and [[teak]] from Sothoryos is said to be used to build ships.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 395}} A corsair's road runs along the continent's northern coast.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} ''A Dance with Dragons'' refers to the diseases on Sothoryos in regards to the wealthy but sick Yunkai slave trader Yezzan zo Qaggaz.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion X, p. 628}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion XI, p. 756}} Victarion compares some people as \"squat and hairy as the apes of Sothoros\",{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}} and some people fighting in Daznak's Pit for Daenerys's entertainment in ''A Dance with Dragons'' are described as \"[[brindle]]-skinned half-men from the jungles of Sothoros\".{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys IX, p. 693}} Martin said that, unlike other peoples in the novels, the brindled men of Sothoryos were pure fantasy constructs.<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\n==Ulthos {{anchor|Ulthos}}==\nThe map collection ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' also shows the north tip of a landmass named \"Ulthos\" to the south of Essos and east of Sothoryos. Asked whether this was another continent, Martin replied, \"Well, it's a large landmass. I am a little unclear on the formal definition of 'continent' as opposed to 'big island.' Also on the size of Ulthos, which after all sits at the edge of the known world. Terra incognita and all that.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog121114>{{cite web | author=George R. R.

The tournament was divided into two sections: the Championship Tournament and the Masters' Tournament. The Championship section was for players who had previously won an international tournament.<ref name = \"fqmpqc\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sunnucks|1970|p=223}}</ref> [[Siegbert Tarrasch]] won the Championship section, over [[Carl Schlechter]], [[Dawid Janowski]], [[Frank Marshall (chess player)|Frank Marshall]], [[Amos Burn]], and [[Mikhail Chigorin]]. These players were described as grandmasters for the purposes of the tournament.\n\nThe [[San Sebasti\u00e1n chess tournament|San Sebasti\u00e1n 1912 tournament]] won by [[Akiba Rubinstein]] was a designated grandmaster event.<ref name=\"TOCOC\"/> Rubinstein won with 12\u00bd points out of 19.

[[Edward Winter (chess historian)|Chess historian Edward Winter]] has questioned this, stating that the earliest known sources that support this story are an article by Robert Lewis Taylor in the June 15, 1940, issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and Marshall's autobiography ''My 50 Years of Chess'' (1942).<ref name=\"KCAK\">{{citation\n| last1=Winter | first1=Edward | author1-link=Edward Winter (chess historian)\n| year=1999 | title=Kings, Commoners and Knaves: Further Chess Explorations | edition=1\n| publisher=Russell Enterprises, Inc.\n| isbn=978-1-888690-04-0\n| pages=315\u2013316}}</ref><ref name=\"Chess Omnibus\">{{citation\n| last1=Winter | first1=Edward | author1-link=Edward Winter (chess historian)\n| year=2003 | title=A Chess Omnibus | edition=1\n| publisher=Russell Enterprises, Inc.\n| isbn=978-1-888690-17-0\n| pages=177\u2013178}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter38.html|title=Chess Notes by Edward Winter|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Informal and Soviet usage before 1950===\nBefore 1950, the term ''grandmaster'' was sometimes informally applied to world class players. The ''[[FIDE|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs]]'' (FIDE, or World Chess Federation) was formed in Paris in 1924, but at that time did not award formal titles.\n\nIn 1927, the Soviet Union's Chess Federation established the title of ''Grandmaster of the Soviet Union'', for their own players, since at that time Soviets were not competing outside their own country. This title was abolished in 1931, after having been awarded to [[Boris Verlinsky]], who won the 1929 [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Championship]].<ref name=\"Soviet Championships\">{{citation\n| last1=Cafferty | first1=Bernard | author1-link=Bernard Cafferty\n| last2=Taimanov | first2=Mark | author2-link=Mark Taimanov\n| year=1998 | title=The Soviet Championships | edition=1\n| publisher=Cadogan Books\n| isbn=978-1-85744-201-4\n| pages=28\u201329}}</ref> The title was brought back in 1935, and awarded to [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], who thus became the first \"official\" Grandmaster of the USSR.

Titles were awarded by a resolution of the FIDE General Assembly and the Qualification Committee. FIDE first awarded the Grandmaster title in 1950 to 27 players. There were no formal written criteria for awarding the titles; it was decided by a vote of the committee. These players were:\n* The top players of the day: world champion [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], and those who had qualified for (or been seeded into) the inaugural [[Candidates Tournament]] in 1950: [[Isaac Boleslavsky]], [[Igor Bondarevsky]], [[David Bronstein]], [[Max Euwe]], [[Reuben Fine]], [[Salo Flohr]], [[Paul Keres]], [[Alexander Kotov]], [[Andor Lilienthal]], [[Miguel Najdorf]], [[Samuel Reshevsky]], [[Vasily Smyslov]], [[Gideon St\u00e5hlberg]], and [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3 (chess player)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3]].\n* Players still living who, though past their best in 1950, were recognised as having been world class when at their peak: [[Ossip Bernstein]], [[Old\u0159ich Duras]], [[Ernst Gr\u00fcnfeld]], [[Boris Kosti\u0107]], [[Grigory Levenfish]], [[G\u00e9za Mar\u00f3czy]], [[Jacques Mieses]], [[Viacheslav Ragozin]], [[Akiba Rubinstein]], [[Friedrich S\u00e4misch]], [[Savielly Tartakower]], and [[Milan Vidmar]].\n\nSince FIDE did not award the Grandmaster title posthumously, world-class players who died prior to 1950, including World Champions [[Wilhelm Steinitz|Steinitz]], Lasker, Capablanca, and Alekhine, never received the title.<ref>{{citation\n|last=Elo | first=Arpad | author-link=Arpad Elo\n|title=The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present\n|year=1978\n|publisher=Arco\n|page=66\n|isbn=978-0-668-04721-0\n}}</ref>\n\n====1953 regulations====\n[[File:Jacques Mieses (monochrome).jpg|thumb|upright=0.90|[[Jacques Mieses]] (1865\u20131954), one of the first [[FIDE]] Grandmasters]]\nTitle awards under the original regulations were subject to political concerns. [[Efim Bogoljubov]], who had emigrated from the Soviet Union to Germany, was not entered in the first class of Grandmasters, even though he had played two matches for the [[World Chess Championship|World Championship]] with Alekhine. He received the title in 1951, by a vote of thirteen to eight with five abstentions. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] supported his application, but all other [[Communist]] countries opposed it. In 1953, FIDE abolished the old regulations, although a provision was maintained that allowed older masters who had been overlooked to be awarded titles. The new regulations awarded the title of International Grandmaster of the FIDE to players meeting any of the following criteria:<ref name=\"Harkness1956\">{{citation\n| last=Harkness | first=Kenneth | author-link=Kenneth Harkness\n| year=1956 | title=The Official Blue Book and Encyclopedia of Chess\n| publisher=David McKay Company\n| pages=332\u2013336\n| oclc=1578704\n| lccn=56014153}}</ref>\n# The world champion.\n# Masters who have the absolute right to play in the World Championship [[Candidates Tournament]], or any player who replaces an absent contestant and earns at least a 50 percent score.\n# The winner of an international tournament meeting specified standards, and any player placing second in two such tournaments within a span of four years. The tournament must be at least eleven rounds with seven or more players, 80 percent or more being International Grandmasters or [[International Master]]s. Additionally, 30 percent of the players must be Grandmasters who have the absolute right to play in the next World Championship Candidates Tournament, or who have played in such a tournament in the previous ten years.\n# A player who demonstrates ability manifestly equal to that of (3) above in an international tournament or match. Such titles must be approved by the Qualification Committee with the support of at least five members.\n\n====1957 regulations====\nAfter FIDE issued the 1953 title regulations, it was recognized that they were somewhat haphazard, and work began to revise the regulations. The FIDE Congress in Vienna in 1957 adopted new regulations, called the FAV system, in recognition of the work done by [[International Arbiter|International Judge]] Giovanni Ferrantes (Italy), Alexander (probably [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander]]), and Giancarlo Dal Verme (Italy). Under the 1957 regulations, the title of International Grandmaster of the FIDE was automatically awarded to:\n# The world champion.\n# Any player qualifying from the [[Interzonal]] tournament to play in the Candidates Tournament, even if he did not play in the Candidates for any reason.\n# Any player who would qualify from the Interzonal to play in the Candidates but who was excluded because of a limitation on the number of participants from his Federation.\n# Any player who actually plays in a Candidates Tournament and scores at least 33\u2153 percent.\nThe regulations also allowed titles to be awarded by a FIDE Congress on recommendation by the Qualification Committee. Recommendations were based on performance in qualifying tournaments, with the required score depending on the percentage of Grandmasters and International Masters in the tournament.<ref name=\"Harkness1967\">{{citation\n| last=Harkness | first=Kenneth | author-link=Kenneth Harkness\n| year=1967 | title=Official Chess Handbook\n| publisher=David McKay Company\n| pages=211\u2013214\n| lccn=66013085\n| oclc=728637}}</ref>\n\n====1965 regulations====\nConcerns were raised that the 1957 regulations were too lax. At the FIDE Congress in 1961, GM [[Milan Vidmar]] said that the regulations \"made it possible to award international titles to players without sufficient merit\". At the 1964 Congress in [[Tel Aviv]], a subcommittee was formed to propose changes to the regulations. The subcommittee recommended that the automatic award of titles be abolished, criticized the methods used for awarding titles based on qualifying performances, and called for a change in the makeup of the Qualification Committee. Several delegates supported the subcommittee recommendations, including GM [[Miguel Najdorf]] who felt that existing regulations were leading to an inflation of international titles.<ref name=\"Harkness1967\"/> At the 1965 Congress in [[Wiesbaden]] FIDE raised the standards required for international titles. The International Grandmaster title regulations were:\n* 1. Any World Champion is automatically awarded the GM title\n* 2a. Anyone who scores at least 40 percent in a quarter-final match in the Candidates Tournament\n* 2b. Scores at least the number of points in a tournament corresponding to the total of a 55 percent score against Grandmasters plus 75 percent against [[International Masters]] (IM) plus 85 percent against other players (a GM \"[[Norm (chess)|norm]]\").\n\nTo fulfill requirement 2b, the candidate must score one GM norm in a category 1a tournament or two norms within a three-year period in two Category 1b tournaments, or one Category 2a tournament and one Category 1b tournament.\n\nThe categories of tournaments are:\n* 1a\u2014at least sixteen players, at least 50 percent are GMs, and 70 percent at least IMs\n* 1b\u2014at least twelve players, at least 33\u2153 percent GMs and 70 percent IMs\n* 2a\u2014at least fifteen players, at least 50 percent IMs\n* 2b\u2014ten to fourteen players, at least 50 percent IMs.\nSince FIDE titles are for life, a GM or IM does not count for the purposes of this requirement if he had not had a GM or IM result in the five years prior to the tournament.\n\nIn addition, no more than 50 percent plus one of the players can be from the same country for tournaments of 10 to 12 players, or no more than 50 percent plus two for larger tournaments.\n\nSeventy-four GM titles were awarded in 1951 through 1968. During that period, ten GM titles were awarded in 1965, but only one in 1966 and in 1968.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sunnucks|1970|pp=224\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n====1970 regulations====\n\nThe modern system for awarding [[FIDE]] titles evolved from the \"Dorazil\" proposals, presented to the [[19th Chess Olympiad|1970 Siegen Chess Olympiad]] FIDE Congress. The proposals were put together by Dr Wilfried Dorazil (then FIDE Vice-President) and fellow Committee members Grandmaster [[Svetozar Gligori\u0107]] and Professor [[Arpad Elo]]. The recommendations of the Committee report were adopted in full.<ref name=\"Siegen Chess Olympiad\">{{citation\n| last1=Keene | first1=Raymond | author1-link=Raymond Keene\n| last2=Levy | first2=David | author2-link=David Levy (chess player)\n| year=1970 | title=Siegen Chess Olympiad | edition=1\n| publisher=Chess Ltd, Sutton Coldfield\n| isbn=\n| pages=238\u2013240}}</ref>\n\nIn essence, the proposals built on the work done by Professor Elo in devising his [[Elo rating]] system. The establishment of an updated list of players and their Elo rating enabled significantly strong international chess tournaments to be allocated a \"Category\", based on the average rating of the contestants. For instance, it was decided that 'Category 1' status would apply to tournaments with an average Elo rating of participants falling within the range 2251\u20132275; similarly Category 2 would apply to the range 2276\u20132300 etc. The higher the tournament Category, the stronger the tournament.\n\nAnother vital component involved the setting of meritorious \"scores\" for each Category of tournament. A player must meet or surpass the relevant score to demonstrate that they had performed at Grandmaster (GM) or International Master (IM) level. Scores were expressed as percentages of a perfect maximum score and decreased as the tournament Category increased, thereby reflecting the strength of a player's opposition and the relative difficulty of the task.\n\nTournament organisers could then apply the percentages to their own tournament format and declare in advance the actual score that participants must achieve to attain a GM or IM result (nowadays referred to as a [[Grandmaster norm|norm]]).\n\n{|\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

Exceptionally, if a player's contributory games totalled thirty or more, then the title could be awarded on the basis of two such results. There were also circumstances where the system could be adapted to fit team events and other competitions.\n\nThe full proposals included many other rules and regulations, covering such topics as:\n* Eligible tournament formats\n* Eligible participants\n* Unrated participants\n* Registration of tournaments with FIDE\n* Calculations, including the handling of fractions\n\n==Honorary grandmasters==\nFrom 1977 until 2003, FIDE awarded honorary Grandmaster titles to 31 players based on their past performances or other contributions to chess. Since 2007, no distinction has been made between an \"honorary\" grandmaster and a full grandmaster. The following players have been awarded honorary Grandmaster titles:\n* 1977 - [[Julio Bolboch\u00e1n]], [[Esteban Canal]], [[Borislav Mili\u0107]], [[Carlos Torre Repetto]]\n* 1981 - [[Arnold Denker]]\n* 1982 - [[Lodewijk Prins]], [[Ra\u00fal Sanguinetti]]\n* 1983 - [[Vladimir Alatortsev]], [[Alexander Konstantinopolsky]], [[Erik Lundin]]\n* 1984 - [[Eero B\u00f6\u00f6k]], [[Stojan Puc]]\n* 1985 - [[Harry Golombek]], [[Mario Monticelli]], [[Jaroslav \u0160ajtar]]\n* 1986 - [[Arthur Dake]], [[Theodor Ghi\u021bescu]]\n* 1987 - [[Vladimir Makogonov]], [[Vladas Mik\u0117nas]], [[Bogdan \u015aliwa]]\n* 1988 - [[George Koltanowski]]\n* 1990 - [[Andrija Fuderer]], [[Rudolf Mari\u0107]]\n* 1991 - [[Dragoljub Mini\u0107]]\n* 1992 - [[Heinz Lehmann (chess player)|Heinz Lehmann]], [[Rudolf Teschner]]\n* 1993 - [[Jonathan Penrose]]\n* 1996 - [[K\u00e1roly Honfi]], [[Enrico Paoli]]\n* 1999 - [[P\u00e9ter Dely]]\n* 2003 - [[Elm\u0101rs Zemgalis]]\n\n==Current regulations==\nThe requirements for becoming a Grandmaster are rather complex. A player must have attained an [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] of at least 2500 (although they need not maintain this level to obtain or keep the title). In addition, at least two favorable results (called ''[[Grandmaster norm|norms]]'') from a total of at least 27 games in tournaments involving at least three other Grandmasters<!---and at least 1/3 of participants GMs, Rule 1.45b-->, including some from countries other than the applicant's, are usually required before FIDE will confer the title on a player. There are other milestones a player can achieve to get the title, such as winning the [[Women's World Chess Championship|Women's World Championship]], the [[World Junior Chess Championship|World Junior Championship]], or the [[World Senior Chess Championship|World Senior Championship]]. Current regulations can be found in the FIDE Handbook.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=198&view=article |title=FIDE Handbook - FIDE Title Regulations effective from 1 July 2017 |publisher=fide.com }}</ref>\n\n==Title inflation==\nIn 1957, there were 50 GMs (USSR: 19, Yugoslavia: 7, U.S.: 5, Argentina: 4, West Germany: 2, France: 2, Sweden: 1, Czechoslovakia: 1, Hungary: 1, Austria: 1, Belgium: 1, Denmark: 1, Netherlands: 1, Poland: 1).<ref>Ajedrez Revista Mensual 1957, p. 403.</ref> In 1972, there were 88 GMs with 33 representing the [[USSR]].

Other minor factors come into play: there are more tournaments worldwide and cheaper air travel makes them more accessible to globe-trotting chess professionals, who include many players from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe whose movements are no longer restricted as they were before the 1990s. Additionally, players can make norms in tournaments that would have been previously considered too short for norms,<ref name=\"Short\">{{Citation |url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3531 |title=Nigel Short wins Commonwealth Championship |author=Praful Zaveri |publisher=chessbase.com |date=December 10, 2006}}</ref> making norms easier to get and allowing for more norm tournaments to be held.\n\nDecember 2008 saw a record number of GMs (1,192) and IMs (2,916), causing some [[FIDE]] officials to suggest that FIDE should consider an \"elite grandmaster\" title.<ref name=\"ACP Report\">{{citation|url=http://www.fide.com/fide/fide-commissions/3616-acp-report-by-gm-bartlmiej-macieja |title=ACP Report by GM Bartlmiej Macieja |first=Bartlomiej |last=Macieja |publisher=Fide.com |date=December 17, 2008 |accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref> The unofficial title \"Super Grandmaster\" is sometimes used by players to refer to those with a 2700+ rating to distinguish the most serious world champion contenders.\nThe proportion of titled players among rated players is actually becoming smaller due to the rise in the number of all chess players worldwide who have FIDE ratings.<ref name=\"ACP Report\"/> In response, one member of the FIDE Titles & Ratings Committee observed that it is now more common for weaker players to get FIDE ratings, so the comparison of Grandmasters as a proportion of all rated players is not really helpful.<ref>[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5111 Remarks on the ACP's FIDE Congress report], Nick Faulks, [[Chessbase]], December 24, 2008</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of chess grandmasters]]\n* [[List of youngest grandmasters]]\n* [[Comparison of top chess players throughout history]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{citation\n| last=Sunnucks | first=Anne |authorlink=Anne Sunnucks\n| year=1970\n| title=The Encyclopaedia of Chess\n| publisher=St. Martins Press\n| isbn=978-0-7091-4697-1}} <!-- ISBN is for the second edition -->\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=58&view=article \"Requirements for FIDE Titles\"] from the FIDE Handbook\n* [http://ratings.fide.com/toplist.phtml \"World Top Chess players\"] FIDE\n\n{{Chess}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Chess grandmasters| ]]\n[[Category:Chess titles]]", "sha1": "o4i9asweh51yk8wsmmsiu20qq1foxhp"}}, {"title": "Gotthold Ephraim Lessing", "ns": "0", "id": "12305", "revision": {"id": "862719445", "parentid": "861269821", "timestamp": "2018-10-06T07:00:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "Omnipaedista", "id": "8524693"}, "comment": "add IPAc-en", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|writer, philosopher, publicist, and art critic}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{Infobox writer\n|name         = Gotthold Ephraim Lessing\n|image        = Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.PNG\n|caption      = Portrait of Lessing by [[Anna Rosina de Gasc|Anna Rosina Lisiewska]] during his time as dramaturg of [[Abel Seyler]]'s [[Hamburgische Entreprise|Hamburg National Theatre]] (1767/1768)\n|birth_date   = {{birth date|1729|1|22|df=y}}\n|birth_place  = [[Kamenz]], [[Upper Lusatia]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]]\n|death_date   = {{death date and age|1781|2|15|1729|1|22|df=y}}\n|death_place  = [[Braunschweig]], [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]\n|occupation   = Writer, philosopher, [[dramatist]], [[publicist]], [[art critic]] and [[dramaturg]]\n|notableworks = ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]''; ''[[Emilia Galotti]]''; ''[[Minna von Barnhelm]]''; ''[[Nathan the Wise]]''; ''Laoco\u00f6n''; ''[[Hamburgische Dramaturgie|Hamburgian Dramaturgy]]''\n|spouse       = [[Eva K\u00f6nig]]\n|alma_mater   = [[Leipzig University]]<br>[[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Wittenberg]]\n|signature    = Lessing Unterschrift.gif\n}}\n\n'''Gotthold Ephraim Lessing''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|\u025b|s|\u026a|\u014b}}; {{IPA-de|\u02c8l\u025bs\u026a\u014b|lang}}; 22 January 1729 \u2013 15 February 1781) was a German writer, philosopher, [[dramatist]], [[publicist]] and [[art critic]], and one of the most outstanding representatives of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era.

His father was a Lutheran minister and wrote on theology. Young Lessing studied at the Latin School in Kamenz from 1737 to 1741. With a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps, Lessing next attended the [[S\u00e4chsisches Landesgymnasium Sankt Afra zu Mei\u00dfen|F\u00fcrstenschule St. Afra]] in [[Meissen]]. After completing his education at St. Afra's, he enrolled at the University of [[Leipzig]] where he pursued a degree in theology, medicine, philosophy, and philology (1746\u20131748).<ref>Lamport, F. J. ''Lessing and the Drama''. New York: Oxford UP, 1981. Print.</ref>\n\nIt was here that his relationship with [[Friederike Caroline Neuber|Karoline Neuber]], a famous German actress, began. He translated several French plays for her, and his interest in theatre grew. During this time, he wrote his first play, ''The Young Scholar.'' Neuber eventually produced the play in 1748.\n\nFrom 1748 to 1760, Lessing lived in Leipzig and [[Berlin]]. He began to work as a reviewer and editor for the ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' and other periodicals. Lessing formed a close connection with his cousin, Christlob Mylius, and decided to follow him to Berlin. In 1750, Lessing and Mylius teamed together to begin a periodical publication named ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Historie und Aufnahme des Theaters''. The publication ran only four issues, but it caught the public's eye and revealed Lessing to be a serious critic and theorist of drama.\n\nIn 1752 he took his master's degree in [[University of Wittenberg|Wittenberg]]. From 1760 to 1765, he worked in [[Breslau]] (now Wroc\u0142aw) as secretary to [[Friedrich Bogislav von Tauentzien|General Tauentzien]] during the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain and France, which had effects in Europe. It was during this time that he wrote his famous ''Laocoon, or the Limitations of Poetry.''\n\nIn 1765 Lessing returned to Berlin, leaving in 1767 to work for three years at the [[Hamburg National Theatre]]. Actor-manager, Konrad Ackermann, began construction on Germany's first permanent theatre in Hamburg. {{Interlanguage link|Johann Friedrich L\u00f6wen|de}} established Germany's first national theatre, the [[Hamburg National Theatre]]. The owners hired Lessing as the theatre's critic of plays and acting, which would later be known as [[dramaturgy]] (based on his own words), making Lessing the very first [[dramaturge]]. The theatre's main backer was [[Abel Seyler]], a former currency speculator who since became known as \"the leading patron of German theatre.\"<ref>Wilhelm Kosch, \"Seyler, Abel\", in ''[[Dictionary of German Biography]]'', eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, {{ISBN|3110966298}}, p. 308</ref> There he met [[Eva K\u00f6nig]], his future wife. His work in Hamburg formed the basis of his pioneering work on drama, titled ''[[Hamburgische Dramaturgie]]''. Unfortunately, because of financial losses due to pirated editions of the ''[[Hamburgische Dramaturgie]]'', the Hamburg Theatre closed just three years later.<ref>\nLamport, F. J. ''Lessing and the Drama''. New York: Oxford UP, 1981. Print.</ref>\n\nIn 1770 Lessing became librarian at the ducal library, now the [[Herzog August Library]] (''Herzog-August-Bibliothek'', ''Bibliotheca Augusta''), in [[Wolfenb\u00fcttel]] under the commission of the Duke of Brunswick. His tenure there was energetic, if interrupted by many journeys. In 1775, for example, he accompanied Prince Leopold to Italy.\n\nOn 14 October 1771 Lessing was initiated into Freemasonry in the lodge \"Zu den drei Goldenen Rosen\" in Hamburg.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing |url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/lessing_g/lessing_g.html |work=2013 |publisher=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon |accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1776 he married Eva K\u00f6nig, who was then a widow, in Jork (near Hamburg). She died in 1778 after giving birth to a short-lived son. On 15 February 1781, Lessing, aged 52, died during a visit to the wine dealer Angott in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]].\n\nLessing was also famous for his friendship with Jewish-German philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]]. A recent biography of Mendelssohn's grandson, [[Felix Mendelssohn|Felix]], describes their friendship as one of the most \"illuminating [[metaphor]]s [for] the clarion call of the Enlightenment for [[religious tolerance]]\".<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Todd |first=R.

He began publishing heated pamphlets on his beliefs which were eventually banned. It was this banishment that inspired him to return to theatre to portray his views and to write ''[[Nathan the Wise]]''.\n\n==Works==\nEarly in his life, Lessing showed interest in the theatre. In his theoretical and critical writings on the subject\u2014as in his own plays\u2014he tried to contribute to the development of a new type of theatre in Germany. With this he especially turned against the then predominant [[literary theory]] of [[Gottsched]] and his followers. Lessing's ''[[Hamburgische Dramaturgie]]'' ran critiques of plays that were performed in the Hamburg Theatre, but after dealing with dissatisfied actors and actresses, Lessing redirected his writings to more of an analysis on the proper uses of drama. Lessing advocated the outline of drama in Aristotle's ''Poetics''. He believed the [[French Academy]] had devalued the uses of drama through their [[Neoclassical theatre|neoclassical rules]] of form and separation of genres. His repeated opinions on this issue influenced theatre practitioners who began the movement of rejecting theatre rules known as ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' (\"Storm and Stress\").<ref>Wilson, Edwin, and Alvin Goldfarb. ''Living Theatre: History of Theatre''. 6th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill Companies, 2012. Print.</ref><ref>Karen Otterweell, ''Lessing and the Sturm und Drang: A Reappraisal Revisited'', Peter Lang Pub, Inc., 2002. Print.</ref> He also supported serious reception of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works. He worked with many theatre groups (e.g. the one of the [[Friederike Caroline Neuber|Neuberin]]).\n\n[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1871) b 161.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Eva K\u00f6nig|Eva Lessing]]]]\n[[File:Lessinghaus Wolfenb\u00fcttel 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Home, [[Wolfenb\u00fcttel]]]]\nIn Hamburg he tried with others to set up the German National Theatre. Today his own works appear as prototypes of the later developed bourgeois German drama. Scholars see ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'' and ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'' as amongst the first [[bourgeois tragedy|bourgeois tragedies]], ''[[Minna von Barnhelm]]'' (Minna of Barnhelm) as the model for many classic German comedies, ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'' (''Nathan der Weise'') as the first German drama of ideas (\"Ideendrama\"). His theoretical writings ''Laocoon'' and ''Hamburg Dramaturgy'' (''Hamburgische Dramaturgie'') set the standards for the discussion of aesthetic and literary theoretical principles. Lessing advocated that dramaturgs should carry their work out working directly with theatre companies rather than in isolation.<ref>Eckersley, M. 1997. Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director. University of Melbourne. Melbourne. p 9.</ref>\n\nIn his religious and philosophical writings he defended the faithful Christian's right for freedom of thought. He argued against the belief in revelation and the holding on to a literal interpretation of the Bible by the predominant orthodox doctrine through a problem later to be called '''Lessing's Ditch'''. Lessing outlined the concept of the religious \"Proof of Power\": How can miracles continue to be used as a base for Christianity when we have no proof of miracles? Historical truths which are in doubt cannot be used to prove metaphysical truths (such as God's existence). As Lessing says it: \"That, then, is the ugly great ditch which I cannot cross, however often and however earnestly I have tried to make that leap.\"<ref>Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. \"On the proof of the spirit and of power.\" ''Lessing: Philosophical and theological writings'', p.&nbsp;87. H. B. Nisbet (translator and editor). Cambridge University Press, 2005</ref>\n\nIn the final leg of his life, Lessing threw himself into an intense evaluation of theology and religion. He did much of his studying by reading manuscripts he found while working as a librarian. While working for the Duke, he formed a close friendship with a family by the name of Reimarus. The family held an unpublished manuscript by [[Hermann Samuel Reimarus]] which attacked the historicity of Christian revelation. Despite discouragement from his brother, Karl, Lessing began publishing pieces of the manuscript in pamphlets known as ''Fragments from an Unnamed Author''. The controversial pamphlets resulted in a heated debate between him and another theologian, Johann Melchior Goeze. In concern for tarnishing his reputation, Goeze requested the government put an end to the feud, and Lessing was silenced through a law that took away his freedom from censorship.<ref>Vallee, Gerard. ''Soundings in G.E. Lessing's Philosophy of Religion''. Lanham: University of America, 2000. Print.</ref>\n\nIn response, Lessing relied upon his skills as a playwright to write what is undoubtedly his most influential play, ''[[Nathan the Wise]]''. In the play, Lessing set up tension between Judaism, Islam, and Christianity by having one character ask Nathan which religion was the most genuine. Nathan avoids the question by telling the parable of the three rings, which implies the idea that no specific religion is the \"correct religion.\" The Enlightenment ideas to which Lessing held tight were portrayed through his \"ideal of humanity,\" stating that religion is relative to the individual's ability to reason. ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'' is considered to be the first example of the German \"literature of humanity\". \nAs a child of the Enlightenment he trusted in a \"Christianity of Reason\", which oriented itself by the spirit of religion. He believed that human reason (initiated by criticism and dissent) would develop, even without help by a divine revelation. In his writing ''The Education of Humankind'' (''Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts'') he extensively and coherently lays out his position.\n\nThe idea of freedom (for the theatre against the dominance of its French model; for religion from the church's dogma) is his central theme throughout his life. Therefore, he also stood up for the liberation of the upcoming middle and upper class from the nobility making up their minds for them.\n\nIn his own literary existence he also constantly strove for independence. But his ideal of a possible life as a free author was hard to keep up against the economic constraints he faced. His project of authors self-publishing their works, which he tried to accomplish in Hamburg with [[Johann Joachim Christoph Bode|C. J. Bode]], failed.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nLessing is important as a [[literary critic]] for his work ''Laocoon: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry''. In this work, he argues against the tendency to take [[Horace]]'s ''ut pictura poesis'' (as painting, so poetry) as prescriptive for literature. In other words, he objected to trying to write poetry using the same devices as one would in painting. Instead, poetry and painting each has its character (the former is extended in time; the latter is extended in space). This is related to Lessing's turn from French [[classicism]] to Aristotelian [[mimesis]], discussed above.\n\n== Vehement attack of the Radical Pietist Johann Daniel M\u00fcller ==\nJohann Daniel M\u00fcller (born 1716 in Wissenbach/Nassau, today part of [[Eschenburg]], deceased after 1785) published the following anonymous book against Lessing and Reimarus:\n* [Johann Daniel M\u00fcller (musician)]: ''Der Sieg der Wahrheit des Worts Gottes \u00fcber die [[Lie|L\u00fcgen]] des [[Wolfenb\u00fcttel]]schen [[librarian|Bibliothecarii]],'' [Gotthold] ''Ephraim Lessing, und seines Fragmenten-Schreibers'' [i. e.

Geotechnical     engineering is important in civil engineering, but also has applications in [[military engineer|military]], [[mining engineering|mining]], [[petroleum engineering|petroleum]] and other [[engineering disciplines]] that are concerned with construction occurring on the surface or within the ground. Geotechnical engineering uses principles of [[soil mechanics]] and [[rock mechanics]] to investigate subsurface conditions and materials; determine the relevant physical/mechanical and chemical properties of these materials; evaluate [[Slope stability|stability of natural slopes]] and man-made soil deposits; assess risks posed by site conditions; design [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] and structure [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]]; and monitor site conditions, earthwork and foundation construction.<ref name=TerzaghiPeckMesri>Terzaghi, K., Peck, R.B. and Mesri, G.

(1981), ''An Introduction to Geotechnical Engineering'', Prentice-Hall, Inc. {{ISBN|0-13-484394-0}}</ref>\n\nA typical geotechnical engineering project begins with a review of project needs to define the required material properties. Then follows a site investigation of [[soil]], rock, fault distribution and [[bedrock]] properties on and below an area of interest to determine their engineering properties including how they will interact with, on or in a proposed [[construction]]. [[Site investigation]]s are needed to gain an understanding of the area in or on which the engineering will take place. Investigations can include the assessment of the risk to humans, property and the environment from natural hazards such as [[earthquake]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[sinkhole]]s, [[soil liquefaction]], [[debris flow]]s and [[rockfall]]s.\n\nA geotechnical engineer then determines and designs the type of foundations, earthworks, and/or pavement subgrades required for the intended man-made structures to be built. Foundations are designed and constructed for structures of various sizes such as high-rise buildings, [[bridge]]s, medium to large commercial buildings, and smaller structures where the soil conditions do not allow code-based design.\n\nFoundations built for above-ground structures include shallow and deep foundations. Retaining structures include earth-filled [[dams]] and retaining walls. Earthworks include [[Embankment (transportation)|embankments]], [[tunnel]]s, [[levee|dikes and levees]], [[Channel (geography)|channels]], [[reservoir]]s, deposition of [[hazardous waste]] and sanitary landfills.\n\nGeotechnical engineering is also related to [[coastal engineering|coastal]] and [[Offshore construction|ocean engineering]]. Coastal engineering can involve the design and construction of [[wharves]], [[marina]]s, and [[jetties]]. Ocean engineering can involve foundation and anchor systems for [[offshore construction|offshore structures]] such as [[oil platforms]].\n\nThe fields of geotechnical engineering and [[engineering geology]] are closely related, and have large areas of overlap.  However, the field of geotechnical engineering is a specialty of [[engineering]], where the field of engineering geology is a specialty of [[geology]].\n\n==History==\nHumans have historically used soil as a material for flood control, irrigation purposes, burial sites, building foundations, and as construction material for buildings. First activities were linked to irrigation and flood control, as demonstrated by traces of dykes, dams, and canals dating back to at least 2000 BCE that were found in ancient [[Egypt]], ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Fertile Crescent]], as well as around the early settlements of [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]] and Harappa in the [[Indus valley]]. As the cities expanded, structures were erected supported by formalized foundations; [[Ancient Greeks]] notably constructed pad footings and [[strip-and-raft foundations]]. Until the 18th century, however, no theoretical basis for soil design had been developed and the discipline was more of an art than a science, relying on past experience.<ref name=das>{{cite book | last = Das | first = Braja | title = Principles of Geotechnical Engineering | publisher = Thomson Learning | year = 2006}}</ref>\n\nSeveral foundation-related engineering problems, such as the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]], prompted scientists to begin taking a more scientific-based approach to examining the subsurface. The earliest advances occurred in the development of [[lateral earth pressure|earth pressure]] theories for the construction of [[retaining walls]]. Henri Gautier, a French Royal Engineer, recognized the \"natural slope\" of different soils in 1717, an idea later known as the soil's [[angle of repose]]. A rudimentary soil classification system was also developed based on a material's unit weight, which is no longer considered a good indication of soil type.<ref name=das/><ref name=budhu>{{cite book | last = Budhu | first = Muni | title = Soil Mechanics and Foundations | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc | year = 2007 | ISBN = 978-0-471-43117-6}}</ref>\n\nThe application of the principles of mechanics to soils was documented as early as 1773 when [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Charles Coulomb]] (a physicist, engineer, and army Captain) developed improved methods to determine the earth pressures against military ramparts. Coulomb observed that, at failure, a distinct slip plane would form behind a sliding retaining wall and he suggested that the maximum shear stress on the slip plane, for design purposes, was the sum of the soil cohesion, <math>c</math>, and friction <math>\\sigma\\,\\!</math> <math> \\tan(\\phi\\,\\!)</math>, where <math>\\sigma\\,\\!</math> is the normal stress on the slip plane and <math>\\phi\\,\\!</math> is the friction angle of the soil. By combining Coulomb's theory with [[Christian Otto Mohr]]'s [[Mohr's circle|2D stress state]], the theory became known as [[Mohr-Coulomb theory]]. Although it is now recognized that precise determination of cohesion is impossible because <math>c</math> is not a fundamental soil property,<ref name=schofield>Disturbed soil properties and geotechnical design, Schofield, Andrew N., Thomas Telford, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7277-2982-9}}</ref> the Mohr-Coulomb theory is still used in practice today.\n\nIn the 19th century [[Henry Darcy]] developed what is now known as [[Darcy's Law]] describing the flow of fluids in porous media. [[Joseph Boussinesq]] (a mathematician and physicist) developed theories of stress distribution in elastic solids that proved useful for estimating stresses at depth in the ground; [[William Rankine]], an engineer and physicist, developed an alternative to Coulomb's earth pressure theory. [[Albert Atterberg]] developed the [[Atterberg limits|clay consistency]] indices that are still used today for soil classification.<ref name=das/><ref name=budhu/> [[Osborne Reynolds]] recognized in 1885 that shearing causes volumetric dilation of dense and contraction of loose granular materials.\n\nModern geotechnical engineering is said to have begun in 1925 with the publication of ''Erdbaumechanik'' by [[Karl Terzaghi]] (a civil engineer and geologist). Considered by many to be the father of modern soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, Terzaghi developed the principle of effective stress, and demonstrated that the shear strength of soil is controlled by effective stress. Terzaghi also developed the framework for theories of bearing capacity of foundations, and the theory for prediction of the rate of settlement of clay layers due to [[consolidation (soil)|consolidation]].<ref name=das/><ref name=schofield/><ref name=\"Lambe and Whitman\">Soil Mechanics, Lambe, T.William and Whitman, Robert V., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, John Wiley & Sons., 1969. {{ISBN|0-471-51192-7}}</ref> In his 1948 book, Donald Taylor recognized that interlocking and dilation of densely packed particles contributed to the peak strength of a soil. The interrelationships between volume change behavior (dilation, contraction, and consolidation) and shearing behavior were all connected via the theory of [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] using [[critical state soil mechanics]] by Roscoe, Schofield, and Wroth with the publication of \"On the Yielding of Soils\" in 1958. [[Critical state soil mechanics]] is the basis for many contemporary advanced [[constitutive model]]s describing the behavior of soil.<ref name=Wood>Soil Behavior and Critical State Soil Mechanics, Wood, David Muir, Cambridge University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-521-33782-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Geotechnical centrifuge modeling]] is a method of testing physical scale models of geotechnical problems. The use of a centrifuge enhances the similarity of the scale model tests involving soil because the strength and stiffness of soil is very sensitive to the confining pressure. The centrifugal acceleration allows a researcher to obtain large (prototype-scale) stresses in small physical models.\n\n==Practicing engineers==\nGeotechnical engineers are typically graduates of a four-year civil engineering program and some hold a [[masters degree]]. In the USA, geotechnical engineers are typically licensed and regulated as Professional Engineers (PEs) in most states; currently only [[California]] and [[Oregon]] have licensed geotechnical engineering specialties. The [http://www.geoprofessionals.org Academy of Geo-Professionals] (AGP) began issuing Diplomate, Geotechnical Engineering (D.GE) certification in 2008.  State governments will typically license engineers who have graduated from an [[ABET]] accredited school, passed the [http://www.ncees.org/Exams/FE_exam.php Fundamentals of Engineering] examination, completed several years of work experience under the supervision of a licensed Professional Engineer, and passed the [[Professional Engineering]] examination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncees.org/engineering/engineering-licensure/ |title=Engineering licensure |accessdate=2017-01-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Soil mechanics ==\n[[File:Soil-phase-diagram.svg|thumb|A phase diagram of soil indicating the weights and volumes of air, soil, water, and voids.]]\n{{Main|Soil mechanics|Rock mechanics}}\n\nIn geotechnical engineering, soils are considered a three-phase material composed of: rock or [[mineral]] particles, water and air. The voids of a soil, the spaces in between mineral particles, contain the water and air.\n\nThe engineering properties of soils are affected by four main factors: the predominant size of the mineral particles, the type of mineral particles, the grain size distribution, and the relative quantities of mineral, water and air present in the soil matrix. Fine particles (fines) are defined as particles less than 0.075&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n\n===Soil properties===\n{{Main|Soil mechanics}}\nSome of the important properties of soils that are used by geotechnical engineers to analyze site conditions and design earthworks, retaining structures, and foundations are:<ref name=HoltzKovacs/>\n; [[Specific weight|Specific weight or Unit Weight]]: Cumulative weight of the solid particles, water and air of the unit volume of soil. Note that the air phase is often assumed to be weightless.\n; [[Porosity]]: Ratio of the volume of voids (containing air, water, or other fluids) in a soil to the total volume of the soil. Porosity is mathematically related to void ratio the by<ref name=\"nptel_Void\">{{cite web | url=http://nptel.ac.in/courses/105103097/web/chap2final/s3.htm | title=Void Ratio | publisher=NPTEL | accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref>\n<math>\nn=\\frac{e}{1+e}\n</math>\n:here ''e'' is void ratio and ''n'' is porosity\n; [[Void ratio]]: The ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of solid particles in a soil mass. Void ratio is mathematically related to the porosity by<ref name=\"nptel_Void\" />\n<math>\ne=\\frac{n}{1-n}\n</math>\n\n; [[Permeability (fluid)|Permeability]]: A measure of the ability of water to flow through the soil. It is expressed in units of velocity.<ref name=\"nptel_P\">{{cite web | url=http://nptel.ac.in/courses/105103097/web/chap6final/s1.htm | title=Permeability | publisher=NPTEL | accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref>\n; [[Compressibility]]: The rate of change of volume with effective stress. If the pores are filled with water, then the water must be squeezed out of the pores to allow volumetric compression of the soil; this process is called consolidation.\n; [[Shear strength (soil)|Shear strength]]: The maximum [[shear stress]] that can be applied in a soil mass without causing shear failure.<ref name=\"nptel_S\">{{cite web | url=http://nptel.ac.in/courses/105103097/web/chap9final/s1.htm | title=Shear strength | publisher=NPTEL | accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref>\n; [[Atterberg Limits]]: [[Atterberg limits#Liquid limit|Liquid limit]], [[Atterberg limits#Plastic limit|Plastic limit]], and [[Atterberg limits#Shrinkage limit|Shrinkage limit]]. These indices are used for estimation of other engineering properties and for [[soil classification]].\n\n== Geotechnical investigation ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}\n{{Main|Geotechnical investigation}}\n\nGeotechnical engineers and engineering geologists perform geotechnical investigations to obtain information on the physical properties of soil and rock underlying (and sometimes adjacent to) a site to design earthworks and foundations for proposed structures, and for repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions. A geotechnical investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, [[Exploration geophysics|geophysical methods]] are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves in-situ testing (two common examples of in-situ tests are the [[standard penetration test]] and [[cone penetration test]]). In addition site investigation will often include subsurface sampling and laboratory testing of the soil samples retrieved. The digging of test pits and trenching (particularly for locating [[Fault (geology)|faults]] and [[landslide|slide planes]]) may also be used to learn about soil conditions at depth. Large diameter borings are rarely used due to safety concerns and expense, but are sometimes used to allow a geologist or engineer to be lowered into the borehole for direct visual and manual examination of the soil and rock stratigraphy.\n\nA variety of [[Geotechnical investigation#Soil sampling|soil samplers]] exist to meet the needs of different engineering projects. The [[standard penetration test]] (SPT), which uses a thick-walled split spoon sampler, is the most common way to collect disturbed samples. Piston samplers, employing a thin-walled tube, are most commonly used for the collection of less disturbed samples. More advanced methods, such as [[ground freezing]] and the Sherbrooke block sampler, are superior, but even more expensive.\n\n[[Atterberg limits]] tests, [[water content]] measurements, and grain size analysis, for example, may be performed on disturbed samples obtained from thick walled [[Geotechnical investigation#Soil sampling|soil samplers]]. Properties such as shear strength, stiffness  hydraulic conductivity, and coefficient of [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidation]] may be significantly altered by sample disturbance. To measure these properties in the laboratory, high quality sampling is required.  Common tests to measure the strength and stiffness include the [[Triaxial shear tests|triaxial shear]] and unconfined compression test.\n\nSurface exploration can include [[geologic map]]ping, [[Exploration geophysics|geophysical methods]], and [[photogrammetry]]; or it can be as simple as an engineer walking around to observe the physical conditions at the site.  Geologic mapping and interpretation of geomorphology is typically completed in consultation with a [[geologist]] or [[engineering geologist]].\n\n[[Exploration geophysics|Geophysical exploration]] is also sometimes used.  Geophysical techniques used for subsurface exploration include measurement of [[seismic waves]] (pressure, shear, and [[Rayleigh waves]]), surface-wave methods and/or downhole methods, and electromagnetic surveys (magnetometer, resistivity, and [[ground-penetrating radar]]).\n\n== Building foundations ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}\n{{Main|Foundation (engineering)}}\nA building's foundation transmits loads from buildings and other structures to the earth. Geotechnical engineers design foundations based on the load characteristics of the structure and the properties of the soils and/or bedrock at the site. In general, geotechnical engineers:\n# Estimate the magnitude and location of the loads to be supported.\n# Develop an investigation plan to [[geotechnical investigation|explore the subsurface]].\n# Determine necessary soil parameters through field and lab testing (e.g., [[consolidation (soil)|consolidation test]], [[triaxial shear test]], vane shear test, [[standard penetration test]]).\n# Design the foundation in the safest and most economical manner.\n\nThe primary considerations for foundation support are [[bearing capacity]], settlement, and ground movement beneath the foundations. Bearing capacity is the ability of the site soils to support the loads imposed by buildings or structures. Settlement occurs under all foundations in all soil conditions, though lightly loaded structures or rock sites may experience negligible settlements. For heavier structures or softer sites, both overall settlement relative to unbuilt areas or neighboring buildings, and differential settlement under a single structure, can be concerns. Of particular concern is settlement which occurs over time, as immediate settlement can usually be compensated for during construction. Ground movement beneath a structure's foundations can occur due to shrinkage or swell of expansive soils due to climatic changes, frost expansion of soil, melting of permafrost, slope instability, or other causes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} All these factors must be considered during design of foundations.\n\nMany building codes specify basic foundation design parameters for simple conditions, frequently varying by jurisdiction, but such design techniques are normally limited to certain types of construction and certain types of sites, and are frequently very conservative.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nIn areas of shallow bedrock, most foundations may bear directly on bedrock; in other areas, the soil may provide sufficient strength for the support of structures. In areas of deeper bedrock with soft overlying soils, deep foundations are used to support structures directly on the bedrock; in areas where bedrock is not economically available, stiff \"bearing layers\" are used to support deep foundations instead.\n\n===Shallow foundations===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}\n{{Main|Shallow foundation}}\n[[Image:Slab on grade.JPG|thumb|right|Example of a slab-on-grade foundation.]]\nShallow foundations are a type of foundation that transfers building load to the very near the surface, rather than to a subsurface layer. Shallow foundations typically have a depth to width ratio of less than 1.\n\n====Footings====\nFootings (often called \"spread footings\" because they spread the load) are structural elements which transfer structure loads to the ground by direct areal contact. Footings can be isolated footings for point or column loads, or strip footings for wall or other long (line) loads. Footings are normally constructed from [[reinforced concrete]] cast directly onto the soil, and are typically embedded into the ground to penetrate through the zone of frost movement and/or to obtain additional bearing capacity.\n\n====Slab foundations====\nA variant on spread footings is to have the entire structure bear on a single slab of concrete underlying the entire area of the structure. Slabs must be thick enough to provide sufficient rigidity to spread the bearing loads somewhat uniformly, and to minimize differential settlement across the foundation. In some cases, flexure is allowed and the building is constructed to tolerate small movements of the foundation instead. For small structures, like single-family houses, the slab may be less than 300&nbsp;mm thick; for larger structures, the foundation slab may be several meters thick.\n\nSlab foundations can be either [[slab-on-grade foundation]]s or embedded foundations, typically in buildings with basements. Slab-on-grade foundations must be designed to allow for potential ground movement due to changing soil conditions.\n\n===Deep foundations===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}\n[[Image:PileDriving.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Pile driver|Pile-driving]] for a bridge in [[Napa, California]].]]\n{{Main|Deep foundations}}\n\nDeep foundations are used for structures or heavy loads when shallow foundations cannot provide adequate capacity, due to size and structural limitations. They may also be used to transfer building loads past weak or compressible soil layers. While shallow foundations rely solely on the [[bearing capacity]] of the soil beneath them, deep foundations can rely on end bearing resistance, frictional resistance along their length, or both in developing the required capacity. Geotechnical engineers use specialized tools, such as the [[cone penetration test]], to estimate the amount of skin and end bearing resistance available in the subsurface.\n\nThere are many types of deep foundations including [[Deep foundation|piles]], drilled shafts, [[caisson (engineering)|caissons]], piers, and earth stabilized columns. Large buildings such as [[skyscraper]]s typically require deep foundations. For example, the [[Jin Mao Tower]] in [[China]] uses tubular steel piles about 1m (3.3&nbsp;feet) driven to a depth of 83.5m (274&nbsp;feet) to support its weight.\n\nIn buildings that are constructed and found to undergo settlement, [[underpinning]] piles can be used to stabilise the existing building.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThere are three ways to place piles for a deep foundation.  They can be driven, drilled, or installed by use of an auger.  Driven piles are extended to their necessary depths with the application of external energy in the same way a nail is hammered.  There are four typical hammers used to drive such piles:  drop hammers, diesel hammers, hydraulic hammers, and air hammers.  Drop hammers simply drop a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it, while diesel hammers use a single cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the Earth.  Similarly, hydraulic and air hammers supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air forces.  Energy imparted from a hammer head varies with type of hammer chosen, and can be as high as a million foot pounds for large scale diesel hammers, a very common hammer head used in practice.  Piles are made of a variety of material including steel, timber, and concrete.   Drilled piles are created by first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth, and filling it with concrete.  Drilled piles can typically carry more load than driven piles, simply due to a larger diameter pile.  The auger method of pile installation is similar to drilled pile installation, but concrete is pumped into the hole as the auger is being removed.<ref name=\"Coduto, et al 2011\">{{cite book|last=Coduto|first=Donald|title=Geotechnical Engineering Principles and Practices|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Higher Education|location=New Jersey|isbn=9780132368681|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n== Lateral earth support structures ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}\n{{Main|Retaining wall}}\nA retaining wall is a structure that holds back earth. Retaining walls stabilize soil and rock from downslope movement or erosion and provide support for vertical or near-vertical grade changes. Cofferdams and bulkheads, structures to hold back water, are sometimes also considered retaining walls.\n\nThe primary geotechnical concern in design and installation of retaining walls is that the weight of the retained material is  creates [[lateral earth pressure]] behind the wall, which can cause the wall to deform or fail. The lateral earth pressure depends on the height of the wall, the density of the soil, the strength of the [[soil mechanics|soil]], and the amount of allowable movement of the wall. This pressure is smallest at the top and increases toward the bottom in a manner similar to hydraulic pressure, and tends to push the wall away from the backfill.  [[Groundwater]] behind the wall that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes an additional horizontal hydraulic pressure on the wall.\n\n===Gravity walls===\nGravity walls depend on the size and weight of the wall mass to resist pressures from behind. Gravity walls will often have a slight setback, or batter, to improve wall stability. For short, landscaping walls, gravity walls made from dry-stacked (mortarless) stone or segmental concrete units (masonry units) are commonly used.\n\nEarlier in the 20th century, taller retaining walls were often gravity walls made from large masses of concrete or stone. Today, taller retaining walls are increasingly built as composite gravity walls such as: geosynthetic or steel-reinforced backfill soil with precast facing; gabions (stacked steel wire baskets filled with rocks), crib walls (cells built up log cabin style from precast concrete or timber and filled with soil or free draining gravel) or soil-nailed walls (soil reinforced in place with steel and concrete rods).\n\nFor ''reinforced-soil gravity walls'', the soil reinforcement is placed in horizontal layers throughout the height of the wall. Commonly, the soil reinforcement is ''geogrid'', a high-strength polymer mesh, that provide tensile strength to hold soil together. The wall face is often of precast, segmental concrete units that can tolerate some differential movement. The reinforced soil's mass, along with the facing, becomes the gravity wall. The reinforced mass must be built large enough to retain the pressures from the soil behind it. Gravity walls usually must be a minimum of 30 to 40 percent as deep (thick) as the height of the wall, and may have to be larger if there is a slope or surcharge on the wall.\n\n===Cantilever walls===\nPrior to the introduction of modern reinforced-soil gravity walls, cantilevered walls were the most common type of taller retaining wall. Cantilevered walls are made from a relatively thin stem of steel-reinforced, cast-in-place concrete or mortared masonry (often in the shape of an inverted T). These walls cantilever loads (like a beam) to a large, structural footing; converting horizontal pressures from behind the wall to vertical pressures on the ground below. Sometimes cantilevered walls are buttressed on the front, or include a counterfort on the back, to improve their stability against high loads. Buttresses are short [[wing wall]]s at right angles to the main trend of the wall. These walls require rigid concrete footings below seasonal frost depth. This type of wall uses much less material than a traditional gravity wall.\n\nCantilever walls resist lateral pressures by friction at the base of the wall and/or ''passive earth pressure'', the tendency of the soil to resist lateral movement.\n\nBasements are a form of cantilever walls, but the forces on the basement walls are greater than on conventional walls because the basement wall is not free to move.\n\n===Excavation shoring===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}\nShoring of temporary excavations frequently requires a wall design which does not extend laterally beyond the wall, so shoring extends below the planned base of the excavation.  Common methods of shoring are the use of ''sheet piles'' or ''soldier beams and lagging''. Sheet piles are a form of driven piling using thin interlocking sheets of steel to obtain a continuous barrier in the ground, and are driven prior to excavation. Soldier beams are constructed of wide flange steel H sections spaced about 2\u20133 m apart, driven prior to excavation. As the excavation proceeds, horizontal timber or steel sheeting (lagging) is inserted behind the H pile flanges.\n\nIn some cases, the lateral support which can be provided by the shoring wall alone is insufficient to resist the planned lateral loads; in this case additional support is provided by walers or tie-backs. Walers are structural elements which connect across the excavation so that the loads from the soil on either side of the excavation are used to resist each other, or which transfer horizontal loads from the shoring wall to the base of the excavation. Tie-backs are steel tendons drilled into the face of the wall which extend beyond the soil which is applying pressure to the wall, to provide additional lateral resistance to the wall.\n\n== Earthworks ==\n[[Image:Seabees compactor roller.jpg|thumb|A [[compactor]]/[[road roller|roller]] operated by U.S. Navy Seabees]]\n\n{{See also|Earthworks (engineering)}}\n*Excavation is the process of training earth according to requirement by removing the soil from the site.\n*Filling is the process of training earth according to requirement by placing the soil on the site.\n*[[Soil compaction|Compaction]] is the process by which the density of soil is increased and permeability of soil is decreased. Fill placement work often has specifications requiring a specific degree of compaction, or alternatively, specific properties of the compacted soil. In-situ soils can be compacted by rolling, deep [[dynamic compaction]], vibration, blasting, gyrating, kneading, compaction grouting etc.\n\n==Ground improvement==\nGround Improvement is a technique that improves the engineering properties of the treated soil mass. Usually, the properties modified are shear strength, stiffness and permeability. Ground improvement has developed into a sophisticated tool to support foundations for a wide variety of structures. Properly applied, i.e. after giving due consideration to the nature of the ground being improved and the type and sensitivity of the structures being built, ground improvement often reduces direct costs and saves time.<ref>{{cite book | title=Ground Improvement Technologies and Case Histories | publisher=Research Publishing Services | author=RAJU, V. R. | id=Ground Improvement \u2013 Principles And Applications In Asia | year=2010 | location=Singapore | pages=809 | isbn=978-981-08-3124-0}}</ref>\n\n==Slope stabilization==\n[[Image:Slopslump2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Simple slope slip section.]]\n{{Main|Slope stability}}\n\nSlope stability is the potential of soil covered slopes to withstand and undergo [[mass wasting|movement]]. Stability is determined by the balance of [[shear stress]] and [[shear strength (soil)|shear strength]]. A previously stable slope may be initially affected by preparatory factors, making the slope conditionally unstable. Triggering factors of a [[slope failure]] can be climatic events can then make a slope actively unstable, leading to mass movements. Mass movements can be caused by increases in shear stress, such as loading, lateral pressure, and transient forces. Alternatively, shear strength may be decreased by weathering, changes in [[pore water pressure]], and organic material.\n\nSeveral modes of failure for earth slopes include falls, topples, slides, and flows.  In slopes with coarse grained soil or rocks, falls typically occur as the rapid descent of rocks and other loose slope material.  A slope topples when a large column of soil tilts over its vertical axis at failure.  Typical slope stability analysis considers sliding failures, categorized mainly as rotational slides or translational slides.  As implied by the name, rotational slides fail along a generally curved surface, while translational slides fail along a more planar surface.  A slope failing as a flow would resemble a fluid flowing downhill.\n\n===Slope stability analysis===\n{{Main|Slope stability analysis}}\n\nStability analysis is needed for the design of engineered slopes and for estimating the risk of slope failure in natural or designed slopes.  A common assumption is that a slope consists of a layer of soil sitting on top of a rigid base.  The mass and the base are assumed to interact via friction.  The interface between the mass and the base can be planar, curved, or have some other complex geometry. The goal of a slope stability analysis is to determine the conditions under which the mass will slip relative to the base and lead to slope failure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pariseau|first=William G.|title=Design analysis in rock mechanics|year=2011|publisher=CRC Press}}</ref>\n\nIf the interface between the mass and the base of a slope has a complex geometry, slope stability analysis is difficult and numerical solution methods are required.  Typically, the exact geometry of the interface is not known and a simplified interface geometry is assumed.  Finite slopes require three-dimensional models to be analyzed.  To keep the problem simple, most slopes are analyzed assuming that the slopes are infinitely wide and can therefore be represented by two-dimensional models.  A slope can be drained or undrained. The undrained condition is used in the calculations to produce conservative estimates of risk.\n\nA popular stability analysis approach is based on principles pertaining to the limit equilibrium concept.  This method analyzes a finite or infinite slope as if it were about to fail along its sliding failure surface. Equilibrium stresses are calculated along the failure plane, and compared to the soils shear strength as determined by [[Shear strength (soil)#Drained shear strength|Terzaghi\u2019s shear strength equation]].  Stability is ultimately decided by a factor of safety equal to the ratio of shear strength to the equilibrium stresses along the failure surface.  A factor of safety greater than one generally implies a stable slope, failure of which should not occur assuming the slope is undisturbed. A factor of safety of 1.5 for static conditions is commonly used in practice.\n\n== Offshore geotechnical engineering ==\n{{Main|Offshore geotechnical engineering}}\n\n[[File:Offshore platforms.jpg|thumb|Platforms offshore Mexico.]]\n''Offshore'' (or ''marine'') ''geotechnical engineering'' is concerned with foundation design for human-made structures in the [[sea]], away from the [[coast]]line (in opposition to ''onshore'' or ''nearshore'').<ref name=\"Dean\">Dean, E.T.R.

These phenomena may affect the integrity or the serviceability of the structure and its foundation during its operational lifespan \u2013 they need to be taken into account in offshore design.\n\nIn [[subsea]] geotechnical engineering, seabed materials are considered a two-phase material composed of 1) rock or [[mineral]] particles and  2) water.<ref name=\"Das\">Das, B.M., 2010.

This includes [[geotextiles]], [[geogrids]], [[geomembranes]], [[geocells]], and [[geocomposites]]. The synthetic nature of the products make them suitable for use in the ground where high levels of durability are required; their main functions include: drainage, filtration, reinforcement, separation and containment. [[Geosynthetics]] are available in a wide range of forms and materials, each to suit a slightly different end use, although they are frequently used together. These products have a wide range of applications and are currently used in many civil and geotechnical engineering applications including: roads, airfields, railroads, embankments, piled embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals, dams, landfills, bank protection and coastal engineering.<ref>Koerner, R.

Highly influential, he has been considered the leading exponent of [[literary realism]] in his country. He is known especially for his [[debut novel]] ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (1857), his ''Correspondence'', and his scrupulous devotion to his style and [[aesthetics]]. The celebrated short story writer [[Guy de Maupassant]] was a [[wikt:prot\u00e9g\u00e9|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] of Flaubert.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life and education===\nFlaubert was born on 12 December 1821, in [[Rouen]], in the [[Seine-Maritime]] department of [[Upper Normandy]], in northern France. He was the second son of Anne Justine Caroline (n\u00e9e Fleuriot; 1793\u20131872) and Achille-Cl\u00e9ophas Flaubert (1784\u20131846), director and senior surgeon of the major hospital in Rouen.<ref>\"Gustave Flaubert's Life\", ''Madame Bovary'', Alma Classics edition, page 309, publ 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-84749-322-4}}</ref> He began writing at an early age, as early as eight according to some sources.<ref>Gustave Flaubert, ''The Letters of Gustave Flaubert 1830\u20131857'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980) {{ISBN|0-674-52636-8}}</ref>\n\nHe was educated at the ''[[Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Corneille (Rouen)|Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Corneille]]'' in Rouen,<ref name=\"LyCo6\">[http://lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr/spip.php?article6 Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Corneille de Rouen \u2013 History]</ref> and did not leave until 1840, when he went to [[Paris]] to study [[law]]. In Paris, he was an indifferent student and found the city distasteful. He made a few acquaintances, including [[Victor Hugo]]. Toward the end of 1840, he travelled in the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Corsica]]. In 1846, after an attack of [[epilepsy]], he left Paris and abandoned the study of law.\n\n===Personal life===\nFrom 1846 to 1854, Flaubert had a relationship with the poet [[Louise Colet]]; [[Flaubert's letters|his letters]] to her have survived. After leaving Paris, he returned to Croisset, near the [[Seine]], close to Rouen, and lived there for the rest of his life. He did however make occasional visits to Paris and England, where he apparently had a mistress.\n\nPolitically, Flaubert described himself as a \"romantic and liberal old dunce\" (''vieille ganache romantique et lib\u00e9rale''),<ref>{{cite book |title=The George Sand-Gustave Flaubert Letters |date=1921 |publisher=Boni and Liveright |page=284}}</ref> an \"enraged [[liberalism|liberal]]\" (''lib\u00e9ral enrag\u00e9''), a hater of all despotism, and someone who celebrated every protest of the individual against power and monopolies.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Weisberg |first1=Richard H. |title=The Failure of the Word: The Protagonist as Lawyer in Modern Fiction |date=1984 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=89}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=S\u00e9ginger |first1=Gis\u00e8le |title=Le Roman de la Momie et Salammb\u00f4.

In 1849\u201350 he went on a long journey to the Middle East, visiting [[Greece]] and Egypt. In [[Beirut]] he contracted [[syphilis]].  He spent five weeks in [[Istanbul]] in 1850. He visited [[Carthage]] in 1858 to conduct research for his novel ''[[Salammb\u00f4]]''.\n\nFlaubert never married and never had children. His reason for not having children is revealed in a letter he sent to Coulet, dated December 11, 1852. In it he revealed that he was [[antinatalism|opposed to childbirth]], saying he would \"transmit to no one the aggravations and the disgrace of existence.\"\n\nFlaubert was very open about his sexual activities with prostitutes in his writings on his travels. He suspected that a [[chancre]] on his penis was from a [[Maronite]] or a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] girl.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PJE5-qdSFT4C&pg=PR2|title=Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary: a reference guide|author=Laurence M.

He was close to his niece, Caroline Commanville, and had a close friendship and correspondence with [[George Sand]]. He occasionally visited Parisian acquaintances, including [[\u00c9mile Zola]], [[Alphonse Daudet]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], and [[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]].\n\nThe 1870s were a difficult time for Flaubert. Prussian soldiers occupied his house during the [[Franco-Prussian War|War of 1870]], and his mother died in 1872. After her death, he fell into financial difficulty due to business failures on the part of his niece's husband. Flaubert suffered from [[sexually transmitted disease|venereal diseases]] most of his life. His health declined and he died at Croisset of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1880 at the age of 58. He was buried in the family vault in the cemetery of Rouen. A monument to him by [[Henri Chapu]] was unveiled at the museum of Rouen.\n\n===Writing career===\n[[File:Gustave Flaubert portrait photo.jpg|thumb|left|Flaubert, photographed by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]]]]\nHis first finished work was ''[[November (Flaubert)|November]]'', a novella, which was completed in 1842.\n\nIn September 1849, Flaubert completed the first version of a novel, ''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]].'' He read the novel aloud to [[Louis Bouilhet]] and [[Maxime Du Camp]] over the course of four days, not allowing them to interrupt or give any opinions. At the end of the reading, his friends told him to throw the manuscript in the fire, suggesting instead that he focus on day-to-day life rather than fantastic subjects.\n\nIn 1850, after returning from Egypt, Flaubert began work on ''[[Madame Bovary]]''. The novel, which took five years to write, was serialized in the ''[[Revue de Paris]]'' in 1856. The government brought an action against the publisher and author on the charge of immorality, which was heard during the following year, but both were acquitted. When ''Madame Bovary'' appeared in book form, it met with a warm reception.\n\nIn 1858, Flaubert travelled to [[Carthage]] to gather material for his next novel, ''[[Salammb\u00f4]]''. The novel was completed in 1862 after four years of work.\n\nDrawing on his youth, Flaubert next wrote ''L'\u00c9ducation sentimentale'' (''[[Sentimental Education]]''), an effort that took seven years. This was his last complete novel, published in the year 1869.\n\nHe wrote an unsuccessful drama, ''Le Candidat,'' and published a reworked version of ''The Temptation of Saint Anthony'', portions of which had been published as early as 1857. He devoted much of his time to an ongoing project, ''Les Deux Cloportes (The Two Woodlice)'', which later became ''[[Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet]]'', breaking the obsessive project only to write the ''[[Three Tales (Flaubert)|Three Tales]]'' in 1877. This book comprises three stories: ''Un C\u0153ur simple'' (''A Simple Heart''), ''La L\u00e9gende de Saint-Julien l'Hospitalier'' (''The Legend of St. [[Julian the Hospitaller]]''), and ''H\u00e9rodias'' (''Herodias''). After the publication of the stories, he spent the remainder of his life toiling on the unfinished ''Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet'', which was posthumously printed in 1881. It was a grand satire on the futility of human knowledge and the ubiquity of mediocrity. He believed the work to be his masterpiece, though the posthumous version received lukewarm reviews. Flaubert was a prolific letter writer, and his letters have been collected in several publications.\n\nAt the time of his death, he may have been working on a further historical novel, based on the [[Battle of Thermopylae]].<ref>Otto Patzer: \"Unwritten Works of Flaubert\" ''Modern Language Notes'' 41:1: January 1926: 24\u201329: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2913889</ref>\n\n==Perfectionist style==\nFlaubert famously avoided the inexact, the abstract and the vaguely inapt expression, and scrupulously eschewed the [[clich\u00e9]].<ref name=\"Gosse1911\"/> In a letter to [[George Sand]] he said that he spends his time \"trying to write harmonious sentences, avoiding [[assonance]]s.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/?id=vFzQdS8N_5IC&pg=PA89 The Letters of Gustave Flaubert: 1857-1880 By Gustave Flaubert, Francis Steegmuller] p.89</ref><ref>Angraj Chaudhary (1991) [https://books.google.com/?id=3k_kAAAAMAAJ ''Comparative aesthetics, East and West''] p.157</ref>\n\nFlaubert believed in, and pursued, the principle of finding \"''le mot juste''\" (\"the right word\"), which he considered as the key means to achieve quality in literary art.<ref name=\" Chandler1958p17\"/> He worked in sullen solitude\u2014sometimes occupying a week in the completion of one page\u2014never satisfied with what he had composed.<ref name=\"Gosse1911\"/> In Flaubert's correspondence he intimates this, explaining correct prose did not flow out of him and that his style was achieved through work and revision.<ref name=\"Gosse1911\">[[Edmund Gosse]] (1911) [http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/f/gustave_flaubert.html ''Flaubert, Gustave''] entry in [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], Volume 10, Slice 4</ref>\n\nThis painstaking style of writing is also evident when one compares Flaubert\u2019s output over a lifetime to that of his peers (for example [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]] or [[\u00c9mile Zola|Zola]]). Flaubert published much less prolifically than was the norm for his time and never got near the pace of a novel a year, as his peers often achieved during their peaks of activity.

There really is a time before Flaubert and a time after him. Flaubert decisively established what most readers and writers think of as modern realist narration, and his influence is almost too familiar to be visible. We hardly remark of good prose that it favors the telling and brilliant detail; that it privileges a high degree of visual noticing; that it maintains an unsentimental composure and knows how to withdraw, like a good valet, from superfluous commentary; that it judges good and bad neutrally; that it seeks out the truth, even at the cost of repelling us; and that the author's fingerprints on all this are paradoxically, traceable but not visible. You can find some of this in [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]] or [[Jane Austen|Austen]] or [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], but not all of it until Flaubert.}}\n\nAs a writer, other than a pure stylist, Flaubert was nearly equal parts [[romanticism|romantic]] and [[Realism (arts)|realist]].<ref name=\"Gosse1911\"/> Hence, members of various schools, especially realists and formalists, have traced their origins to his work. The exactitude with which he adapts his expressions to his purpose can be seen in all parts of his work, especially in the portraits he draws of the figures in his principal romances. The degree to which Flaubert's fame has extended since his death presents an interesting chapter of literary history in itself. He is also credited with spreading the popularity of the color Tuscany Cypress, a color often mentioned in his chef-d'\u0153uvre ''Madame Bovary''.\n\n[[Image:Flaubert-Giraud.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait by [[Eug\u00e8ne Giraud]]]]\n\nFlaubert's lean and precise writing style has had a large influence on 20th-century writers such as [[Franz Kafka]] and [[J. M. Coetzee]]. As [[Vladimir Nabokov]] discussed in his famous lecture series:<ref>Nabokov (1980) [https://books.google.com/?id=MmDuAAAAMAAJ ''Lectures on literature'', Volume 1], p.256</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The greatest literary influence upon Kafka was Flaubert's. Flaubert who loathed pretty-pretty prose would have applauded Kafka's attitude towards his tool. Kafka liked to draw his terms from the language of law and science, giving them a kind of ironic precision, with no intrusion of the author's private sentiments; this was exactly Flaubert's method through which he achieved a singular poetic effect. The legacy of his work habits can best be described, therefore, as paving the way towards a slower and more introspective manner of writing.\n</blockquote>\nThe publication of ''Madame Bovary'' in 1856 was followed by more scandal than admiration; it was not understood at first that this novel was the beginning of something new: the scrupulously truthful portraiture of life. Gradually, this aspect of his genius was accepted, and it began to crowd out all others. At the time of his death, he was widely regarded as the most influential French Realist. Under this aspect Flaubert exercised an extraordinary influence over [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Edmond de Goncourt]], [[Alphonse Daudet]], and [[\u00c9mile Zola|Zola]]. Even after the decline of the Realist school, Flaubert did not lose prestige in the literary community; he continues to appeal to other writers because of his deep commitment to aesthetic principles, his devotion to style, and his indefatigable pursuit of the perfect expression.\n\nHis ''\u0152uvres Compl\u00e8tes'' (8 vols., 1885) were printed from the original manuscripts, and included, besides the works mentioned already, the two plays ''Le Candidat'' and ''Le Ch\u00e2teau des c\u0153urs''. Another edition (10 vols.) appeared in 1873\u201385. Flaubert's correspondence with [[George Sand]] was published in 1884 with an introduction by Guy de Maupassant.\n\nHe has been admired or written about by almost every major literary personality of the 20th century, including [[philosopher]]s and [[sociologist]]s such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes]],  [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] whose partially psychoanalytic portrait of Flaubert in ''[[The Family Idiot]]'' was published in 1971. [[Georges Perec]] named ''[[Sentimental Education]]'' as one of his favourite novels. The Peruvian novelist [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] is another great admirer of Flaubert. Apart from ''[[Perpetual Orgy]]'', which is solely devoted to Flaubert's art, one can find lucid discussions in Vargas Llosa's ''Letters to a Young Novelist'' (published 2003). In public lecture on May 1966 at the Kaufmann Art Gallery in New York, [[Marshall McLuhan]] claimed that \"I derived all my knowledge of media from people like Flaubert and [[Rimbaud]] and [[Baudelaire]].\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Understanding Me: Lectures and Interviews|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3QTFN6ArdKUC|publisher = McClelland & Stewart|date = 2010-06-25|isbn = 9781551994161|first = Herbert Marshall|last = Mcluhan}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Major works===\n*''R\u00eave d'enfer'' (1837)\n*''[[Memoirs of a Madman]]'' (1838)\n*''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (1857)\n*''[[Salammb\u00f4 (novel)|Salammb\u00f4]]'' (1862)\n*''[[Sentimental Education]]'' (1869)\n*''Le Candidat'' (1874)\n*''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'' (1874)\n*''[[Three Tales (Flaubert)|Three Tales]]'' (1877)\n*''[[Le Ch\u00e2teau des c\u0153urs]]'' (1880)\n*''[[Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet]]'' (1881)\n*''[[Dictionary of Received Ideas]]'' (1911)\n*''Souvenirs, notes et pens\u00e9es intimes'' (1965)\n\n===Adaptations===\n* The opera ''[[H\u00e9rodiade]]'' by [[Jules Massenet]], based on Flaubert's novella ''H\u00e9rodias''\n* The opera ''[[Madame Bovary (opera)|Madame Bovary]]'' by [[Emmanuel Bondeville]], based on Flaubert's novel\n* The unfinished opera ''Salammbo'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]], orchestrated by [[Zolt\u00e1n Pesk\u00f3]], based on Flaubert's novel.\n* [[Madame Bovary (disambiguation)|Eight films]] titled ''Madame Bovary''.\n* ''La l\u00e9gende de Saint-Julien l'Hospitalier'' (1888), an opera by [[Camille Erlanger]]\n\n===Correspondence (in English)===\n*Selections:\n**''Selected Letters'' (ed.

Beginning in the late 1960s, Chaitin made contributions to [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[metamathematics]], in particular a computer-theoretic result equivalent to [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]]. He is considered to be one of the founders of what is today known as Kolmogorov (or Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity together with [[Andrei Kolmogorov]] and [[Ray Solomonoff]]. Today, [[algorithmic information theory]] is a common subject in any computer science curriculum. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Mathematics and computer science==\nHe attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]] and [[City College of New York]], where he (still in his teens) developed the theory that led to his independent discovery of [[Kolmogorov complexity]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Li |last2=Vitanyi |title=An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications |publisher=Springer |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LKEmB_GQ53QC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&f=false |page=92 |quote=G.J.Chaitin had finished the Bronx High School of Science, and was an 18-year-old undergraduate student at City College of the City University of New York, when he submitted two papers....

Watson Research Center in New York and remains an emeritus researcher. He has written more than 10 books that have been translated to about 15 languages. He is today interested in questions of [[metabiology]] and information-theoretic formalizations of the theory of evolution.\n\n==Other scholarly contributions==\nChaitin also writes about [[philosophy]], especially [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]] (particularly about epistemological matters in mathematics). In metaphysics, Chaitin claims that [[algorithmic information theory]] is the key to solving problems in the field of [[biology]] (obtaining a formal definition of 'life', its origin and [[evolution]]) and  [[neuroscience]] (the problem of [[consciousness]] and the study of the mind).\n\nIn recent writings, he defends a position known as [[digital philosophy]]. In the [[epistemology]] of mathematics, he claims that his findings in [[mathematical logic]] and algorithmic information theory show there are \"mathematical facts that are true for no reason, they're true by accident. They are random mathematical facts\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ithistory.org/honor-roll/professor-gregory-john-chaitin|title=Professor Gregory John Chaitin|publisher=[[IT History Society]]|accessdate=2016-07-12}}</ref> Chaitin proposes that mathematicians must abandon any hope of proving those mathematical facts and adopt a [[quasi-empirical]] methodology.\n\n==Honors==\nIn 1995 he was given the degree of doctor of science ''[[honoris causa]]'' by the [[University of Maine]]. In 2002 he was given the title of honorary professor by the [[University of Buenos Aires]] in Argentina, where his parents were born and where Chaitin spent part of his youth.

Their father was from the Croatian region of [[Zagorje]], specifically [[Sveti Petar \u010cvrstec]] village near [[Kri\u017eevci, Croatia|Kri\u017eevci]], while their mother was born in [[Virovitica]] to parents that had shortly before her birth arrived in the nearby village of [[\u010cemernica, Croatia|\u010cemernica]], settling there from the village of [[Kazanci]] near [[Gacko]] in eastern [[Herzegovina]]. Goran's maternal grandfather, fought in the [[Royal Serbian Army]] at the [[Macedonian Front|Salonica Front]] during [[World War I]] and as a reward received land in [[Slavonia]] where he soon moved his family.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\">{{cite news|last1=Gruji\u0107|first1=Nenad|last2=Nik\u010devi\u0107|first2=Tamara|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1090566|title=Cigani, juri\u0161!|agency=''[[Vreme]]''|date=27 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nGoran's parents met shortly after [[World War II]] in Virovitica where his mother Borka lived and his father Franjo (who fought on the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] side during the war) attended a [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) military school.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Franjo Bregovi\u0107 soon got his first job, teaching [[ballistics]] at a military school in Sarajevo, so the couple that at the time  moved there.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Goran, their first child, was born in 1950 in Sarajevo.\n\nGoran was 10 years old when his parents divorced. In later interviews, he mentioned his father's alcoholism as the reason for the breakdown of their marriage.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Soon after the split, his father moved to [[Livno]], taking Goran's younger brother Predrag with him while Goran remained living with his mother in Sarajevo, visiting his father and brother every summer in Livno.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Their father soon retired and eventually moved back to his home village in Zagorje while Goran's brother Predrag later moved back to Sarajevo for university studies.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/>\n\nGoran played [[violin]] in a [[music school]]. However, deemed untalented, he was thrown out during second grade. His musical education was thus reduced to what his friend taught him until Goran's mother bought him his first [[guitar]] in his early teens. Bregovi\u0107 wanted to enroll in a [[fine art]]s high school, but his aunt told his mother that it was supposedly full of homosexuals, which precipitated his mother's decision to send him to a technical (traffic) school. As a compromise for not getting his way, she allowed him to grow his hair long.\n\n==Early career==\nUpon entering high school, Goran joined the school band Izohipse where he began on [[bass guitar]]. Soon, however, he was kicked out of that school too (this time for misbehavior - he crashed into a school-owned [[Mercedes-Benz]]). Bregovi\u0107 then entered grammar school and its school band Be\u0161tije (again as a bass guitar player). When he was 16, his mother left him and moved to the coast, meaning that other than having a few relatives to rely on, he mostly had to take care of himself. He did that by playing [[folk music]] in a [[kafana]] in [[Konjic]], working on construction sites, and selling newspapers.\n\nSpotting him at a Be\u0161tije gig in 1969, [[\u017deljko Bebek]] invited 18-year-old Bregovi\u0107 to play bass guitar in his band [[Kodeksi]], which Goran gladly accepted.\n\n===Kodeksi===\n{{main|Kodeksi}}\nEventually, Kodeksi shifted setup so Bregovi\u0107 moved from [[bass guitar|bass]] to [[lead guitar]], resulting in Kodeksi having the following line-up during summer 1970: Goran Bregovi\u0107, \u017deljko Bebek, [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]] and [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]]. All of them would eventually become members of [[Bijelo Dugme]] at some point in the future. At the time, they were largely influenced by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Black Sabbath]]. During the fall of 1970, this resulted in the departure of \u017deljko Bebek, who (both as [[rhythm guitar]] player and [[singer]]) got phased out of the band. At the end of the year, Goran's mother and Zoran's brother arrived in [[Naples]] and took them back to [[Sarajevo]].\n\n===Jutro===\n{{main|Jutro}}\nThen, in the autumn of 1971, Goran enrolled at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, studying [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]]. He soon quit, however. At the same time, [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]] left for [[London]], so Bregovi\u0107 formed a band with Nuno Arnautali\u0107 called [[Jutro]] (Morning), which Red\u017ei\u0107 soon joined as well. Over the next few years, the band changed lineups frequently, and on 1 January 1974 modified its name to [[Bijelo Dugme]] (\"White Button\").\n\n==Bijelo Dugme==\n{{main|Bijelo Dugme}}\nFrom 1974 until 1989, Bregovi\u0107 played lead guitar and was the main creative force behind [[Bijelo Dugme]] (''White Button''). For years they stood as one of the most popular bands in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]].\n\n==Solo career==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bregovic Redzic Bebek 2005.jpg|330px|thumb|Goran Bregovi\u0107, [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]] and [[\u017deljko Bebek]] on 2005 [[Bijelo dugme]] concert in [[Sarajevo]]]] -->\nAt the time Bijelo Dugme was falling apart, Goran entered the world of [[Film score|film music]]. His first project was [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'' (1989). This turned out to be a great success (both the film and the soundtrack). Goran and Emir's collaboration continued, and Goran composed music (which was performed by [[Iggy Pop]]) for Emir's next film ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' (1993). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Goran lived in Paris, but he also lived in Belgrade. His next major project, music for [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]]'s ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|Queen Margot]]'' was a great success as well, and as a result, the film won two awards on the 1994 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The next year's [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] award \nwent to ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'', for which Goran Bregovi\u0107 composed the music.\n\nIn 1997, he worked with Turkish singer [[Sezen Aksu]] on her album ''D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn ve Cenaze'' (''Wedding and Funeral''). After that album, he continued making composite albums with other musicians that were based on his music and singers' lyrics.\n\nHe made an album with [[George Dalaras]] in 1999 named ''[[Thessaloniki \u2013 Yannena with Two Canvas Shoes]]''. In the same year, Bregovi\u0107 recorded an album called ''[[Kayah i Bregovi\u0107]]'' (Kayah and Bregovi\u0107) with popular [[Poland|Polish]] singer [[Kayah (singer)|Kayah]] which sold over 700,000 copies in [[Poland]] (seven times platinum record).\n\nIn 2001, he recorded another album with another Polish singer, [[Krzysztof Krawczyk (singer)|Krzysztof Krawczyk]], titled \"Daj mi drugie \u017cycie\" (\"Give Me Second Life\").\n\nIn 2005, Bregovi\u0107 took part in three large farewell concerts of Bijelo Dugme.\n\nA number of works created by Bregovi\u0107 can be heard on the soundtrack to the 2006 film [[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]], most notably \"\u0110ur\u0111evdan.\" The film itself actually features more Bregovi\u0107 samples than the soundtrack.  Two musical numbers by Bregovi\u0107, \"Ne Siam Kurve Tuke Sijam Prostitutke,\" and \"Gas, Gas\" were featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 Brazilian ''novela'', [[Salve Jorge]], on the television network [[Rede Globo]].<ref name=\"Salve Jorge Tracklist\">{{cite web|title=Salve Jorge (Trilha Sonora da Novela) [|url=http://musica.com.br/trilhas-sonoras/salve-jorge.html|publisher=Musica.com.br|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Wedding and Funeral Orchestra===\nFor many years Bregovi\u0107 performed with a large ensemble of musicians: a brass band, bagpipes, a string ensemble, a tuxedo-clad all-male choir from [[Belgrade]], women wearing traditional [[Bulgaria]]n costumes, and [[Romani people|Roma]] singers make up his 40-piece band and orchestra.\n\nSince 1998, and until about 2012, Bregovi\u0107 has been performing his music mainly in the form of concerts all over the world with his Wedding and Funeral Orchestra. This consists of 10 people (in the small version) or 37 (in the large version, although, in some instances, this number varies, depending on participants from the host country).\n\nSince 2012 the orchestra consists of 9 people (in the small version) or 19 (in the large version), as it played in New York at the Lincoln Center on 15 July and 16 July 2016.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160810225129/http://www.lincolncenterfestival.org/assets/img/downloads/07-15%20Goran.pdf Brochure for the concert in New York (PDF)]</ref>\n\nThe small orchestra consists of Muharem-Muki Redzepi (vocals, drums), Bokan Stankovi\u0107 (first trumpet), Dragi\u0107 Veli\u0107ovi\u0107 (second trumpet), Stojan Dimov (sax, clarinet), Aleksandar Rajkovi\u0107 (first trombone, glockenspiel), Milo\u0161 Mihajlovi\u0107 (second trombone), female vocals Bulgarian singers [[Daniela Radkova|Daniela Radkova-Aleksandrova]], and [[Ludmila Radkova|Ludmila Radkova-Traikova]], and Goran himself. \nThe large orchestra includes also string quartet: Ivana Mateij\u0107 (first violin), Bojana Jovanovi\u0107-Joti\u0107 (second violin), Sa\u0161a Mirkovi\u0107 (viola), and Tatjana Jovanovi\u0107-Mirkovi\u0107, as well as sextet of male voices: Dejan Pesi\u0107 (first tenor), Milan Pani\u0107 and Ranko Jovi\u0107 (second tenors), Aleksandar Novakovi\u0107 (baritone), Dusan Ljubinkovi\u0107 and Sini\u0161a Dutina (basses).\n\nIn previous years, in the orchestra the following musicians have performed: Ogi Radivojevi\u0107 and [[Alen Ademovi\u0107]] (vocals, drums), Dalibor Luki\u0107 (second trumpet), Dejan Manigodi\u0107 (tuba), Vaska Jankovska (vocals).\n\nIn 2013, as part of his Asia-Pacific tour (including Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong), Bregovi\u0107 performed with a string quartet, a male choir, Bulgarian singers and half of a brass band. The other part of the brass band - including bass and percussions - were being played from his computer. In 2017, he was a guest artist on Puerto Rican rapper [[Residente]]'s album ''Residente'' on the song \"El Futuro Es Nuestro\" (Spanish for \"The Future is Ours\").\n\n===Eurovision===\nDuring the [[Eurovision 2008]] final in [[Belgrade Arena]], Serbia, he had a small concert.<ref>{{YouTube|PF8gVaEHnRI}} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>\nHe also composed the Serbian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010; 'Ovo Je Balkan' sung by [[Milan Stankovi\u0107]].\n\n==Musical style==\nBregovi\u0107's compositions, extending Balkan musical inspirations to innovative extremes, draw upon European classicism and Balkan rhythms.<ref>Lincoln Center Festival website</ref>\n\nBregovi\u0107's music carries [[Bosnian music|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian music|Bulgarian]], [[Croatian music|Croatian]], [[Greek music|Greek]], [[Romani music|Romani]], [[Romanian music|Romanian]], [[Serbian music|Serbian]], [[Albanian music|Albanian]], [[Music of Italy|Italian]] and [[Turkish music|Turkish]] themes and is a fusion of [[popular music]] with traditional [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] music from the Balkans, [[tango music|tango]], and [[Balkan Brass Band|brass band]]s.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1993, Bregovi\u0107 married his long-time girlfriend D\u017eenana Sud\u017euka, a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] model.{{sfn|Glas javnosti|2000}} The wedding ceremony held in [[Paris]] featured film director [[Emir Kusturica]] as the groom's best man and longtime Bijelo Dugme backing vocal, Amila Sulejmanovi\u0107 as the bride's maid of honour.\n\nThe couple has three daughters: Ema (born in March 1995), Una (February 2002), and Lulu (May 2004).\n\nBregovi\u0107 owns real-estate properties all over the world, but spends most of his time between [[Belgrade]], where most of his musical collaborators reside, and [[Paris]], where his spouse lives with their three daughters.\n\nHe also has a daughter named \u017deljka (born out of wedlock from a previous relationship) who gave birth to Goran's granddaughter, Bianca. He has a brother named Predrag who lives in [[New York City]], and a sister, Dajana who lives in [[Split, Croatia|Split]].\n\nOn 12 June 2008, Bregovi\u0107 injured his spine, falling from a tree. He fell four meters from a cherry tree in the garden of his home in [[Senjak]], a [[Belgrade]] district, breaking vertebrae. However, according to the doctors, his condition was \"stable without neurological complications.\"<ref name=\"afp\">http://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/goran-bregovic-se-vraca-u-sarajevo-sa-porodicom/110107038#</ref> After surgery, he made a quick recovery and on 8 July and 9 July, he held two big concerts in New York City, where for more than two hours each night, he proved his performance skills had not suffered from the accident.<ref>[http://blog.veni.com/?p=518 Goran Bregovic plays in New York]</ref>\n\n===Political views===\nBregovi\u0107 has described himself as [[Yugonostalgic]].{{sfn|Glas javnosti|2000}} He prefers to avoid delving into politics.

[[Pregnancy (mammals)|Mammals during pregnancy]] can have one or more gestations at the same time for example in a [[multiple birth]].\n\nThe time interval of a gestation is called the ''[[gestation period]]''. In [[obstetrics and gynecology|human obstetrics]], ''[[gestational age]]'' refers to the [[Human fertilization#Fertilization age|embryonic or fetal age]] plus two weeks. This is approximately the duration since the woman's [[Menstruation#Onset and frequency)|last menstrual period (LMP)]] began.\n\n==Mammals==\n{{main|Pregnancy (mammals)}}\n\nIn mammals, pregnancy begins when a [[zygote]] (fertilized ovum) implants in the female's [[uterus]] and ends once the fetus leaves the uterus.\n\nOn the main article link above, are average and approximate gestation values ordered by number of days (note: human gestational age is counted from the last menstrual period; for other animals the counting method varies, so these figures could be 14 days off)\n\n===Humans===\n{{main|Pregnancy}}\nHuman pregnancy can be divided roughly into three trimesters, each approximately three months long. The first trimester is from the last period to the 13th week, the second trimester is from the 14th to 27th week, and the third trimester is from the 28th week to the 42nd week.<ref name=\"ACOG_BabyGrowth\">[http://www.acog.org/~/media/For%20Patients/faq156.pdf?dmc=1&ts=20130303T2230398164 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists - How Your Baby Grows During Pregnancy]</ref>\n\nIn humans, birth normally occurs at a gestational age of about 40 weeks, though it is common for births to occur from 37 to 42 weeks.<ref name=\"ACOG_BabyGrowth\"/> After 8 weeks, the embryo is called a fetus. \n\n==Non-mammals==\nA viviparous [[animal]] is an animal employing [[viviparity]]: the embryo develops inside the body of the mother, as opposed to outside in an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] ([[oviparity]]). The mother then gives live birth. The less developed form of viviparity is called [[ovoviviparity]], which, for instance, occurs in most [[Viperidae|vipers]]. The more developed form of viviparity is called [[placenta|placental viviparity]]; mammals are the best example, but it has also evolved independently in other animals, such as in [[scorpion]]s, some [[shark]]s, and in [[velvet worm]]s. Viviparous offspring live independently and require an external food supply from birth. Certain lizards also employ this method such as the genera ''Tiliqua'' and ''Corucia.'' The placenta is attached directly to the mother in these lizards which is called viviparous matrotrophy.\n\nOvoviviparous [[animal]]s develop within [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s that remain within the mother's body up until they hatch or are about to hatch. This strategy of [[childbirth|birth]] is known as ovoviviparity. It is similar to vivipary in that the embryo develops within the mother's body. Unlike the embryos of viviparous species, ovoviviparous [[embryo]]s are nourished by the [[egg yolk]] rather than by the mother's body. However, the mother's body does provide [[gas exchange]]. Ovoviviparity is the method of reproduction used by many aquatic life forms such as [[fish]] and some [[shark]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[invertebrate]]s. The young of ovoviviparous [[amphibian]]s are sometimes born as [[larva]]e, and undergo [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] outside the body of the mother.\n\nThe [[Syngnathidae]] family of fish has the unique characteristic whereby females lay their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in a brood pouch on the male's chest, and the male incubates the eggs. Fertilization may take place in the pouch or before implantation in the water. Included in Syngnathidae are [[seahorse]]s, the [[pipefish]], and the [[weedy sea dragon|weedy]] and [[leafy sea dragon]]s. Syngnathidae is the only family in the animal kingdom to which the term \"[[male pregnancy]]\" has been applied.<ref name=\"biology\">{{cite journal | last = Jones | first = Adam G. |author2=Avise, John C. | title = Male Pregnancy | journal = Current Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 20 | pages = R791 | date = 2003-10-14 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2003.09.045 | pmid = 14561416}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Evolution of mammals]] (for the evolution of gestation-related features in humans and other mammals)\n*[[Male pregnancy]]\n*[[Nesting instinct]]\n*[[Pregnancy]]\n*[[Pregnancy in fish]]\n*[[Prenatal development]]\n*[[Prenatal nutrition and birth weight]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/tmot1/mus_musc.htm NSRL.ttu.edu]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004723.html Table listing average animal gestation periods]\n\n[[Category:Reproduction in mammals]]", "sha1": "qk5pnhgmmnktilmcvmwci5dejkdp8ch"}}, {"title": "GNU General Public Licence", "ns": "0", "id": "12313", "redirect": {"title": "GNU General Public License"}, "revision": {"id": "15910010", "parentid": "8207", "timestamp": "2002-02-25T15:51:15Z", "contributor": {"username": "Zundark", "id": "70"}, "comment": "redirect to American spelling", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[GNU_General_Public_License]]", "sha1": "5kpum6ew1mbje6wox92bqpjxyb9no4e"}}, {"title": "Gamma function", "ns": "0", "id": "12316", "revision": {"id": "863830950", "parentid": "861557854", "timestamp": "2018-10-13T10:15:34Z", "contributor": {"ip": "103.192.44.197"}, "comment": "[[Gamma correction]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about||the gamma function of ordinals|Veblen function|the gamma distribution in statistics|Gamma distribution|the function used in video and image color representations|Gamma correction}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n\n[[File:Gamma plot.svg|thumb|right|325px|The gamma function along part of the real axis]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''gamma function''' (represented by {{math|'''\u0393'''}}, the capital [[Greek alphabet]] letter [[gamma]]) is an extension of the [[factorial]] [[function (mathematics)|function]], with its [[argument of a function|argument]] shifted down by 1, to [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s. If {{math|''n''}} is a [[Sign (mathematics)|positive]] integer,\n\n:<math>\\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!</math>\n\nThe gamma function is defined for all complex numbers except the non-positive integers. For complex numbers with a positive real part, it is defined via a convergent [[improper integral]]:\n\n:<math> \\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty x^{z-1} e^{-x}\\,dx</math>\n\nThis integral function is extended by [[analytic continuation]] to all complex numbers except the non-positive integers (where the function has simple poles), yielding the [[meromorphic function]] we call the gamma function. It has no zeroes, so the [[reciprocal gamma function]] {{math|1/\u0393(''z'')}} is a [[holomorphic function]]. In fact the gamma function corresponds to the [[Mellin transform]] of the negative [[exponential function]]:\n\n:<math> \\Gamma(z) = \\{ \\mathcal M e^{-x} \\} (z)</math>\n\nThe gamma function is a component in various probability-distribution functions, and as such it is applicable in the fields of [[probability]] and [[statistics]], as well as [[combinatorics]].\n\n== Motivation ==\n[[File:Factorial Interpolation.svg|thumb|250px|The gamma function interpolates the factorial function to non-integer values.]]\n\nThe gamma function can be seen as a solution to the following [[interpolation]] problem:\n: \"Find a [[smooth curve]] that connects the points&nbsp;{{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} given by {{math|''y'' {{=}} (''x'' \u2212 1)!}} at the positive integer values for&nbsp;{{math|''x''}}.\"\n\nA plot of the first few factorials makes clear that such a curve can be drawn, but it would be preferable to have a formula that precisely describes the curve, in which the number of operations does not depend on the size of&nbsp;{{math|''x''}}. The simple formula for the factorial, {{math|''x''! {{=}} 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 \u2026 \u00d7 ''x''}}, cannot be used directly for fractional values of {{math|''x''}} since it is only valid when {{math|''x''}} is a [[natural number]] (''i.e.'', a positive integer). There are, relatively speaking, no such simple solutions for factorials; no finite combination of sums, products, powers, [[exponential function]]s, or [[logarithm]]s will suffice to express&nbsp;{{math|''x''!}}; but it is possible to find a general formula for factorials using tools such as [[integral]]s and [[limit of a function|limits]] from [[calculus]]. A good solution to this is the gamma function.<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\nThere are infinitely many continuous extensions of the factorial to non-integers: infinitely many curves can be drawn through any set of isolated points. The gamma function is the most useful solution in practice, being [[analytic function|analytic]] (except at the non-positive integers), and it can be characterized{{ambiguous|reason=What does it mean that it can be {{''}}characterized{{''}}?|date=September 2018}} in several ways. However, it is not the only analytic function which extends the factorial, as adding to it any analytic function which is zero on the positive integers, such as {{math|''k'' sin ''m{{pi}}x''}}, will give another function with that property.<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\n[[File:Gamma plus sin pi z.png|thumb|250px|The gamma function, {{math| \u0393(z)}} in blue, plotted along with {{math| \u0393(z) + sin({{pi}}z)}} in green. Notice the intersection at positive integers, both are valid analytic continuations of the factorials to the non-integers]]\n\nA more restrictive property than satisfying the above interpolation is to satisfy the [[recurrence relation]] defining a translated version of the factorial function,\n\n:<math>f(1) = 1, </math>\n:<math>f(x+1) = x f(x),</math>\n\nfor {{math|''x''}} equal to any positive real number. But this would allow for multiplication by any periodic analytic function which is one on the positive integers, such as {{math|''e''<sup>''k'' sin ''m{{pi}}x''</sup>}}.

The digamma function, which is the derivative of this function, is also commonly seen.\nIn the context of technical and physical applications, e.g. with wave propagation, the functional equation\n\n:<math> \\ln \\Gamma(z) = \\ln \\Gamma(z+1) - \\ln z</math>\n\nis often used since it allows one to determine function values in one strip of width 1 in {{math|''z''}} from the neighbouring strip. In particular, starting with a good approximation for a&nbsp;{{math|''z''}} with large real part one may go step by step down to the desired&nbsp;{{math|''z''}}.

A striking example is the [[Taylor series]] of {{math|ln(\u0393)}} around 1:\n\n:<math>\\ln \\Gamma(1+z)= -\\gamma z +\\sum_{k=2}^\\infty \\frac{\\zeta(k)}{k} \\, (-z)^k \\qquad \\forall\\; |z| < 1</math>\n\nwith {{math|''\u03b6''(''k'')}} denoting the [[Riemann zeta function]] at {{math|''k''}}.\n\nSo, using the following property:\n:<math>\\zeta(s) \\Gamma(s) = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{t^s}{e^t-1} \\, \\frac{dt}{t}</math>\nwe can find an integral representation for the {{math|ln(\u0393)}} function:\n\n:<math>\\ln \\Gamma(1+z)= -\\gamma z + \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-zt}-1+zt}{t(e^t -1)} \\, dt </math>\n\nor, setting {{math|''z'' {{=}} 1}} and calculating {{math|''\u03b3''}}:\n\n:<math>\\ln \\Gamma(1+z)= \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-zt}-ze^{-t}-1+z}{t(e^t -1)} \\, dt </math>\n\nThere also exist special formulas for the logarithm of the gamma function for rational {{math|''z''}}. \nFor instance, if <math>k</math> and <math>n</math> are integers with <math>k<n</math> and <math>k\\neq n/2</math>, then\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\ln\\Gamma \\biggl(\\!\\frac{k}{n}\\!\\biggr)&=\\frac{(n-2k)\\ln2\\pi}{2n} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\{\\ln\\pi-\\ln\\sin\\frac{\\pi k}{n} \\right\\} + \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\!\\sum_{r=1}^{n-1}\\frac{\\gamma+\\ln{r}}{r}\\cdot\\sin\\frac{2\\pi r k}{n} \\\\\n& \\quad - \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sin\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\cdot\\!\\int_0^\\infty \\!\\!\\frac{\\,e^{-nx}\\!\\cdot\\ln{x}\\,}{\\,\\cosh{x}-\\cos\\dfrac{2\\pi k}{n}\\,}\\,dx\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nsee.<ref name=\"iaroslav_07\">{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X14002820 | doi=10.1016/j.jnt.2014.08.009 | volume=148 | title=A theorem for the closed-form evaluation of the first generalized Stieltjes constant at rational arguments and some related summations | year=2015 | journal=Journal of Number Theory | pages=537\u2013592 | last1 = Blagouchine | first1 = Iaroslav V.| arxiv=1401.3724 }}</ref>\nThis formula is sometimes used for numerical computation, since the integrand decreases very quickly.\n\n=== Integration over log-gamma ===\n\nThe integral\n\n:<math> \\int_0^z \\ln \\Gamma (x) \\, dx</math>\n\ncan be expressed in terms of the [[Barnes G-function|Barnes {{math|''G''}}-function]]<ref name=\"Alexejewsky\">{{cite journal|first=W.

For example, if {{math|''f''}} is a power function and {{math|''g''}} is a linear function, a simple change of variables gives the evaluation\n\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty t^b e^{-at} \\,dt = \\frac{\\Gamma(b+1)}{a^{b+1}}.</math>\n\nThe fact that the integration is performed along the entire positive real line might signify that the gamma function describes the cumulation of a time-dependent process that continues indefinitely, or the value might be the total of a distribution in an infinite space.\n\nIt is of course frequently useful to take limits of integration other than 0 and {{math|\u221e}} to describe the cumulation of a finite process, in which case the ordinary gamma function is no longer a solution; the solution is then called an [[incomplete gamma function]]. (The ordinary gamma function, obtained by integrating across the entire positive real line, is sometimes called the ''complete gamma function'' for contrast.)\n\nAn important category of exponentially decaying functions is that of [[Gaussian function]]s\n:<math>ae^{-\\frac{(x-b)^2}{c^2}}</math>\nand integrals thereof, such as the [[error function]]. There are many interrelations between these functions and the gamma function; notably, {{math|{{sqrt|\u03c0}}}} obtained by evaluating {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|1|2}})}} is the \"same\" as that found in the normalizing factor of the error function and the [[normal distribution]].\n\nThe integrals we have discussed so far involve transcendental functions, but the gamma function also arises from integrals of purely algebraic functions. In particular, the [[arc length]]s of [[ellipse]]s and of the [[Lemniscate of Bernoulli#Arc length and elliptic functions|lemniscate]], which are curves defined by algebraic equations, are given by [[elliptic integral]]s that in special cases can be evaluated in terms of the gamma function. The gamma function can also be used to [[Volume of an n-ball|calculate \"volume\" and \"area\"]] of {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[hypersphere]]s.\n\nAnother important special case is that of the [[beta function]]\n\n:<math>\\Beta(x,y) = \\int_0^1 t^{x-1}(1-t)^{y-1}\\,dt = \\frac{\\Gamma(x)\\,\\Gamma(y)}{\\Gamma(x+y)}.</math>\n\n=== Calculating products ===\nThe gamma function's ability to generalize factorial products immediately leads to applications in many areas of mathematics; in [[combinatorics]], and by extension in areas such as [[probability theory]] and the calculation of [[power series]]. Many expressions involving products of successive integers can be written as some combination of factorials, the most important example perhaps being that of the [[binomial coefficient]]\n\n: <math> \\binom n k = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.</math>\n\nThe example of binomial coefficients motivates why the properties of the gamma function when extended to negative numbers are natural. A binomial coefficient gives the number of ways to choose {{math|''k''}} elements from a set of {{math|''n''}} elements; if {{math|''k'' > ''n''}}, there are of course no ways. If {{math|''k'' > ''n''}}, {{math|(''n'' \u2212 ''k'')!}} is the factorial of a negative integer and hence infinite if we use the gamma function definition of factorials\u2014dividing by infinity gives the expected value of 0.\n\nWe can replace the factorial by a gamma function to extend any such formula to the complex numbers. Generally, this works for any product wherein each factor is a [[rational function]] of the index variable, by factoring the rational function into linear expressions. If {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''Q''}} are monic polynomials of degree {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}} with respective roots {{math|''p''{{sub|1}}, \u2026, ''p{{sub|m}}''}} and {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}, \u2026, ''q{{sub|n}}''}}, we have\n\n:<math>\\prod_{i=a}^b \\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)} = \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^m \\frac{\\Gamma(b-p_j+1)}{\\Gamma(a-p_j)} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\Gamma(a-q_k)}{\\Gamma(b-q_k+1)} \\right).</math>\n\nIf we have a way to calculate the gamma function numerically, it is a breeze to calculate numerical values of such products. The number of gamma functions in the right-hand side depends only on the degree of the polynomials, so it does not matter whether {{math|''b'' \u2212 ''a''}} equals 5 or 10<sup>5</sup>. By taking the appropriate limits, the equation can also be made to hold even when the left-hand product contains zeros or poles.\n\nBy taking limits, certain rational products with infinitely many factors can be evaluated in terms of the gamma function as well. Due to the [[Weierstrass factorization theorem]], analytic functions can be written as infinite products, and these can sometimes be represented as finite products or quotients of the gamma function. We have already seen one striking example: the reflection formula essentially represents the sine function as the product of two gamma functions. Starting from this formula, the exponential function as well as all the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions can be expressed in terms of the gamma function.\n\nMore functions yet, including the [[hypergeometric function]] and special cases thereof, can be represented by means of complex [[contour integral]]s of products and quotients of the gamma function, called [[Barnes integral|Mellin\u2013Barnes integral]]s.\n\n=== Analytic number theory ===\n\nAn elegant and deep application of the gamma function is in the study of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. A fundamental property of the Riemann zeta function is its [[functional equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)\\zeta(s)\\pi^{-\\frac{s}{2}} = \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1-s}{2}\\right)\\zeta(1-s)\\pi^{-\\frac{1-s}{2}}.</math>\n\nAmong other things, this provides an explicit form for the [[analytic continuation]] of the zeta function to a meromorphic function in the complex plane and leads to an immediate proof that the zeta function has infinitely many so-called \"trivial\" zeros on the real line. Borwein ''et al''. call this formula \"one of the most beautiful findings in mathematics\".<ref>{{cite book |author = Borwein, J., Bailey, D.

Factorial numbers, considered as discrete objects, are an important concept in classical number theory because they contain many prime factors, but Riemann found a use for their continuous extension that arguably turned out to be even more important.\n\n== History ==\nThe gamma function has caught the interest of some of the most prominent mathematicians of all time. Its history, notably documented by [[Philip J. Davis]] in an article that won him the 1963 [[Chauvenet Prize]], reflects many of the major developments within mathematics since the 18th century. In the words of Davis, \"each generation has found something of interest to say about the gamma function. Perhaps the next generation will also.\"<ref name=\"Davis\">{{cite journal|last=Davis |first=P.

Euler gave two different definitions: the first was not his integral but an [[infinite product]],\n\n:<math>n! = \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k}\\right)^n}{1+\\frac{n}{k}}\\,,</math>\n\nof which he informed Goldbach in a letter dated October 13, 1729. He wrote to Goldbach again on January 8, 1730, to announce his discovery of the integral representation\n\n:<math>n!=\\int_0^1 (-\\ln s)^n\\, ds\\,,</math>\n\nwhich is valid for {{math|''n'' > 0}}. By the change of variables {{math|''t'' {{=}} \u2212ln ''s''}}, this becomes the familiar Euler integral. Euler published his results in the paper \"De progressionibus transcendentibus seu quarum termini generales algebraice dari nequeunt\" (\"On transcendental progressions, that is, those whose general terms cannot be given algebraically\"), submitted to the [[St. Petersburg Academy]] on November 28, 1729.<ref>Euler's paper was published in ''Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae'' 5, 1738, 36\u201357. See [http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E019.html E19 -- De progressionibus transcendentibus seu quarum termini generales algebraice dari nequeunt], from The Euler Archive, which includes a scanned copy of the original article.</ref> Euler further discovered some of the gamma function's important functional properties, including the reflection formula.\n\n[[James Stirling (mathematician)|James Stirling]], a contemporary of Euler, also attempted to find a continuous expression for the factorial and came up with what is now known as [[Stirling's formula]]. Although Stirling's formula gives a good estimate of {{math|''n''!}}, also for non-integers, it does not provide the exact value. Extensions of his formula that correct the error were given by Stirling himself and by [[Jacques Philippe Marie Binet]].\n\n=== 19th century: Gauss, Weierstrass and Legendre ===\n[[File:Euler factorial paper.png|thumb|250px|alt=De progressionibus transcendentibus, seu quarum termini generales algebraicae dari nequeunt|The first page of Euler's paper]]\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] rewrote Euler's product as\n\n:<math>\\Gamma(z) = \\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\frac{m^z m!}{z(z+1)(z+2)\\cdots(z+m)}</math>\n\nand used this formula to discover new properties of the gamma function. Although Euler was a pioneer in the theory of complex variables, he does not appear to have considered the factorial of a complex number, as instead Gauss first did.<ref name=\"Remmert\">{{cite book |last=Remmert |first=R. |translator-last=Kay |translator-first=L. D. |title = Classical Topics in Complex Function Theory |publisher = Springer |year = 2006 |isbn = 0-387-98221-3 }}</ref> Gauss also proved the [[multiplication theorem]] of the gamma function and investigated the connection between the gamma function and [[elliptic integral]]s.\n\n[[Karl Weierstrass]] further established the role of the gamma function in [[complex analysis]], starting from yet another product representation,\n\n:<math>\\Gamma(z) = \\frac{e^{-\\gamma z}}{z} \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty \\left(1 + \\frac{z}{k}\\right)^{-1} e^\\frac{z}{k},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03b3''}} is the [[Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant]]. Weierstrass originally wrote his product as one for {{math|{{sfrac|1|\u0393}}}}, in which case it is taken over the function's zeros rather than its poles. Inspired by this result, he proved what is known as the [[Weierstrass factorization theorem]]\u2014that any entire function can be written as a product over its zeros in the complex plane; a generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]].\n\nThe name gamma function and the symbol {{math|\u0393}} were introduced by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] around 1811; Legendre also rewrote Euler's integral definition in its modern form. Although the symbol is an upper-case Greek gamma, there is no accepted standard for whether the function name should be written \"gamma function\" or \"Gamma function\" (some authors simply write \"{{math|\u0393}}-function\"). The alternative \"pi function\" notation {{math|\u03a0(''z'') {{=}} ''z''!}} due to Gauss is sometimes encountered in older literature, but Legendre's notation is dominant in modern works.\n\nIt is justified to ask why we distinguish between the \"ordinary factorial\" and the gamma function by using distinct symbols, and particularly why the gamma function should be normalized to {{math|\u0393(''n'' + 1) {{=}} ''n''!}} instead of simply using \"{{math|\u0393(''n'') {{=}} ''n''!}}\". Consider that the notation for exponents, {{math|''x<sup>n</sup>''}}, has been generalized from integers to complex numbers {{math|''x<sup>z</sup>''}} without any change. Legendre's motivation for the normalization does not appear to be known, and has been criticized as cumbersome by some (the 20th-century mathematician [[Cornelius Lanczos]], for example, called it \"void of any rationality\" and would instead use {{math|''z''!}}).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lanczos |first=C. |date=1964 |title=A precision approximation of the gamma function |journal=J. SIAM Numer. Anal. Ser. B |volume=1}}</ref> Legendre's normalization does simplify a few formulae, but complicates most others. From a modern point of view, the Legendre normalization of the Gamma function is the integral of the additive [[character (mathematics)|character]] {{math|''e''<sup>\u2212''x''</sup>}} against the multiplicative character {{math|''x<sup>z</sup>''}} with respect to the [[Haar measure]] <math>\\tfrac{dx}{x}</math> on the [[Lie group]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>+</sup>}}. Thus this normalization makes it clearer that the gamma function is a continuous analogue of a [[Gauss sum]].\n\n=== 19th\u201320th centuries: characterizing the gamma function ===\nIt is somewhat problematic that a large number of definitions have been given for the gamma function. Although they describe the same function, it is not entirely straightforward to prove the equivalence. Stirling never proved that his extended formula corresponds exactly to Euler's gamma function; a proof was first given by [[Charles Hermite]] in 1900.<ref name=\"Knuth\">{{cite book |last= Knuth |first=D. E. |title = The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1 (Fundamental Algorithms) |publisher = Addison-Wesley |year = 1997 }}</ref> Instead of finding a specialized proof for each formula, it would be desirable to have a general method of identifying the gamma function.\n\nOne way to prove would be to find a [[differential equation]] that characterizes the gamma function. Most special functions in applied mathematics arise as solutions to differential equations, whose solutions are unique. However, the gamma function does not appear to satisfy any simple differential equation. [[Otto H\u00f6lder]] proved in 1887 that the gamma function at least does not satisfy any [[algebraic differential equation|''algebraic'' differential equation]] by showing that a solution to such an equation could not satisfy the gamma function's recurrence formula, making it a [[transcendentally transcendental function]]. This result is known as [[H\u00f6lder's theorem]].\n\nA definite and generally applicable characterization of the gamma function was not given until 1922. [[Harald Bohr]] and [[Johannes Mollerup]] then proved what is known as the ''[[Bohr\u2013Mollerup theorem]]'': that the gamma function is the unique solution to the factorial recurrence relation that is positive and ''[[logarithmic convexity|logarithmically convex]]'' for positive {{math|''z''}} and whose value at 1 is 1 (a function is logarithmically convex if its logarithm is convex).\n\nThe Bohr\u2013Mollerup theorem is useful because it is relatively easy to prove logarithmic convexity for any of the different formulas used to define the gamma function. Taking things further, instead of defining the gamma function by any particular formula, we can choose the conditions of the Bohr\u2013Mollerup theorem as the definition, and then pick any formula we like that satisfies the conditions as a starting point for studying the gamma function. This approach was used by the [[Bourbaki group]].\n\n[[Jonathan Borwein|Borwein]] & Corless<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1                 = Borwein\n| first1                = Jonathan M. \n| author-link1          = Jonathan Borwein\n| last2                 = Corless\n| first2                = Robert M. \n| title                 = Gamma and Factorial in the Monthly\n| journal               = American Mathematical Monthly\n| language              = en\n| publisher             = Mathematical Association of America\n| publication-date      = 2017\n| volume                = 125\n| pages                 = 400\u201324\n| arxiv                 = 1703.05349\n| bibcode= 2017arXiv170305349B\n| doi                   = 10.1080/00029890.2018.1420983\n}}</ref> review three centuries of work on the gamma function.\n\n=== Reference tables and software ===\n\nAlthough the gamma function can be calculated virtually as easily as any mathematically simpler function with a modern computer\u2014even with a programmable pocket calculator\u2014this was of course not always the case. Until the mid-20th century, mathematicians relied on hand-made tables; in the case of the gamma function, notably a table computed by Gauss in 1813 and one computed by Legendre in 1825.\n\n[[File:Jahnke gamma function.png|thumb|300px|A hand-drawn graph of the absolute value of the complex gamma function, from ''Tables of Higher Functions'' by [[Eugen Jahnke|Jahnke]] and [[Fritz Emde|Emde]].]]\n\nTables of complex values of the gamma function, as well as hand-drawn graphs, were given in ''Tables of Higher Functions'' by [[Eugen Jahnke|Jahnke]] and [[Fritz Emde|Emde]], first published in Germany in 1909.

As electronic computers became available for the production of tables in the 1950s, several extensive tables for the complex gamma function were published to meet the demand, including a table accurate to 12 decimal places from the U.S. [[National Bureau of Standards]].<ref name=Davis />\n\n''[[Abramowitz and Stegun]]'' became the standard reference for this and many other special functions after its publication in 1964.\n\nDouble-precision floating-point implementations of the gamma function and its logarithm are now available in most scientific computing software and special functions libraries, for example [[TK Solver]], [[Matlab]], [[GNU Octave]], and the [[GNU Scientific Library]]. The gamma function was also added to the [[C (programming language)|C]] standard library ([[math.h]]). Arbitrary-precision implementations are available in most [[computer algebra system]]s, such as [[Mathematica]] and [[Maple (software)|Maple]]. [[PARI/GP]], [[MPFR]] and [[MPFUN]] contain free arbitrary-precision implementations. A little-known feature of the calculator app included with the [[Android operating system]] is that it will accept fractional values as input to the factorial function and return the equivalent gamma function value.

He grew up in [[Le Havre]] and trained to be a [[house painter]] and [[interior decorator|decorator]] like his father and grandfather. However, he also studied artistic painting during evenings at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]], in Le Havre, from about 1897 to 1899. In Paris, he apprenticed with a decorator and was awarded his certificate in 1902. The next year, he attended the Acad\u00e9mie Humbert, also in Paris, and painted there until 1904. It was here that he met [[Marie Laurencin]] and [[Francis Picabia]].<ref name=MoMA />\n\n==Fauvism==\n[[File:Georges Braque, 1906, L'Olivier pr\u00e8s de l'Estaque (The Olive tree near l'Estaque).jpg|thumb|Georges Braque, 1906, ''L'Olivier pr\u00e8s de l'Estaque'' (''The Olive tree near l'Estaque'').

The Fauves, a group that included [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]] among others, used brilliant colors to represent emotional response. Braque worked most closely with the artists [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Othon Friesz]], who shared Braque's hometown of Le Havre, to develop a somewhat more subdued Fauvist style. In 1906, Braque traveled with Friesz to [[L'Estaque]], to [[Antwerp]], and home to Le Havre to paint.<ref name=MoMA />\n\nIn May 1907, he successfully exhibited works of the Fauve style in the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]]. The same year, Braque's style began a slow evolution as he became influenced by [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] who had died in 1906 and whose works were exhibited in Paris for the first time in a large-scale, museum-like retrospective in September 1907. The 1907 C\u00e9zanne retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] greatly affected the [[avant-garde]] artists of Paris, resulting in the advent of Cubism.\n\n==Cubism==\n[[File:Georges Braque, 1909, Still Life with Metronome (Still Life with Mandola and Metronome), oil on canvas, 81 x 54.1 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Georges Braque, late 1909, ''Still Life with Metronome'' (''Still Life with Mandola and Metronome''), oil on canvas, 81 x 54.1 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

He conducted an intense study of the effects of light and perspective and the technical means that painters use to represent these effects, seeming to question the most standard of artistic conventions. In his village scenes, for example, Braque frequently reduced an architectural structure to a geometric form approximating a cube, yet rendered its shading so that it looked both flat and three-dimensional by fragmenting the image. He showed this in the painting ''[[Houses at l'Estaque]]''.\n\nBeginning in 1909, Braque began to work closely with [[Pablo Picasso]] who had been developing a similar [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] style of painting. At the time, Pablo Picasso was influenced by [[Gauguin]], C\u00e9zanne, [[African masks]] and [[Iberian sculpture]] while Braque was interested mainly in developing C\u00e9zanne's ideas of multiple perspectives. \u201cA comparison of the works of Picasso and Braque during 1908 reveals that the effect of his encounter with Picasso was more to accelerate and intensify Braque\u2019s exploration of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s ideas, rather than to divert his thinking in any essential way.\u201d<ref>Fry 1966, p. 71.</ref> Braque\u2019s essential subject is the ordinary objects he has known practically forever.

Working alone, he began to moderate the harsh abstraction of cubism. He developed a more personal style characterized by brilliant color, textured surfaces, and\u2014after his relocation to the Normandy seacoast\u2014the reappearance of the human figure. He painted many [[still life]] subjects during this time, maintaining his emphasis on structure. One example of this is his 1943 work ''Blue Guitar'', which hangs in the [[Allen Memorial Art Museum]].<ref>[http://oberlin.edu/amam/documents/16_Braque_BlueGuitar.pdf Allen Memorial Art Museum]</ref> During his recovery he became a close friend of the cubist artist [[Juan Gris]].\n\nHe continued to work during the remainder of his life, producing a considerable number of paintings, graphics, and sculptures. Braque, along with Matisse, is credited for introducing Pablo Picasso to [[Fernand Mourlot]], and most of the [[lithography|lithographs]] and book illustrations he himself created during the 1940s and '50s were produced at the [[Mourlot Studios]]. In 1962 Braque worked with master printmaker [[Aldo Crommelynck]] to create his series of etchings and aquatints titled ''L\u2019Ordre des Oiseaux'' (''The Order of Birds''),<ref>{{cite news | first = William | last = Grimes | title = Aldo Crommelynck, Master Printer for Prominent Artists, Is Dead at 77 | date = January 29, 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/arts/design/29crommelynck.html?_r=1 | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2012-05-27}}</ref> which was accompanied by the poet [[Saint-John Perse]]'s text.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.princeton.edu/graphicarts/2011/11/braque.html | title = L'ordre des oiseaux | accessdate = 2012-05-27 | last = Mellby | first = Julie L. | date = November 30, 2011 | work = Highlights from the Graphic Arts Collection, Princeton University Library}}</ref>\n\nBraque died on 31 August 1963 in Paris. He is buried in the cemetery of the Church of St. Valery in [[Varengeville-sur-Mer]], [[Normandy]] whose windows he designed. Braque's work is in most major museums throughout the world.\n\n==Style==\nBraque believed that an artist experienced beauty \"\u2026 in terms of volume, of line, of mass, of weight, and through that beauty [he] interpret[s] [his] subjective impression...\u201d<ref>Mullins 1968, p. 34.</ref> He described \"objects shattered into fragments\u2026 [as] a way of getting closest to the object\u2026Fragmentation helped me to establish space and movement in space\u201d.<ref>Mullins 1968, p. 55.</ref> He adopted a [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and neutral color palette in the belief that such a palette would emphasize the subject matter.\n\nAlthough Braque began his career painting landscapes, during 1908 he, alongside Picasso, discovered the advantages of painting [[still life]]s instead. Braque explained that he\n\u201c\u2026 began to concentrate on still-lifes, because in the still-life you have a tactile, I might almost say a manual space\u2026 This answered to the hankering I have always had to touch things and not merely see them\u2026 In tactile space you measure the distance separating you from the object, whereas in visual space you measure the distance separating things from each other. This is what led me, long ago, from landscape to still-life\u201d<ref>Mullins 1968, p. 41.</ref> A still life was also more accessible, in relation to [[perspective (visual)|perspective]], than landscape, and permitted the artist to see the multiple perspectives of the object. Braque's early interest in still lifes revived during the 1930s.\n\nDuring the period between the wars, Braque exhibited a freer style of Cubism, intensifying his color use and a looser rendering of objects. However, he still remained committed to the cubist method of simultaneous perspective and fragmentation. In contrast to Picasso, who continuously reinvented his style of painting, producing both representational and cubist images, and incorporating [[Surrealism|surrealist]] ideas into his work, Braque continued in the Cubist style, producing luminous, other-worldly still life and figure compositions. By the time of his death in 1963, he was regarded as one of the elder statesmen of the [[School of Paris]], and of [[modern art]].\n\n==2010 theft==\nOn 20 May 2010, the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] reported the overnight theft of five paintings from its collection.

GCC is a key component of the [[GNU toolchain]] and the standard compiler for most Unix-like operating systems. The [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) distributes GCC under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GNU GPL). GCC has played an important role in the growth of [[free software]], as both a tool and an example.\n\nWhen it was first released in 1987, GCC 1.0 was named the '''GNU C Compiler''' since it only handled the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]].<ref name=\"release-history\" /> It was extended to compile [[C++]] in December of that year. [[Compiler frontend|Front ends]] were later developed for [[Objective-C]], [[Objective-C++]], [[Fortran]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], and [[Go (programming language)|Go]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/frontends.html|title=Programming Languages Supported by GCC|accessdate=2014-06-23|publisher=GNU Project }}</ref>\n\nVersion 4.5 of the [[OpenMP]] specification<!--list as a language, [[Clang]] does..--> is now supported in the C and C++ compilers<!-- as opposed to partial support for Fortran, which cites \"Improved support for OpenMP and OpenACC.--><ref name=\"gcc6\">{{cite web |url=https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-6/changes.html |title=GCC 6 Release Series}}</ref> and a \"much improved\" implementation of the [[OpenACC]] 2.0a specification<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/OpenACC |title=OpenACC}}</ref> is also supported. <!--cite web |title=Offloading Support in GCC |quote=OpenMP to Intel MIC targets (upcoming Intel Xeon Phi products codenamed KNL) as well as MIC emulation on host.

Tanenbaum]], the author of the [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] (also known as the ''[[VU University Amsterdam|Free University]]'' Compiler Kit) for permission to use that software for GNU. When Tanenbaum advised him that the compiler was not free, and that only the ''Free University'' kit was free, Stallman decided to write a new compiler.<ref>{{cite book |last=von Hagen |first=William |date=2006 |title=The Definitive Guide to GCC |edition=2nd |series=Definitive Guides |publisher=Apress |isbn=978-1-4302-0219-6 |page=XXVII |quote=So he wrote to VUCK's author asking if GNU could use it.

Users invoke a language-specific driver program (<code>gcc</code> for C, <code>g++</code> for C++, etc.), which interprets [[Command-line argument|command arguments]], calls the actual compiler, runs the [[Assembly language assembler|assembler]] on the output, and then optionally runs the [[Linker (computing)|linker]] to produce a complete [[executable]] binary.\n\nEach of the language compilers is a separate program that reads source code and outputs [[machine code]]. All have a common internal structure. A per-language front end [[parsing|parses]] the source code in that language and produces an [[abstract syntax tree]] (\"tree\" for short).\n\nThese are, if necessary, converted to the middle end's input representation, called ''GENERIC'' form; the middle end then gradually transforms the program towards its final form. [[Compiler optimization]]s and [[static code analysis]] techniques (such as FORTIFY_SOURCE,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/Features |title=Security Features: Compile Time Buffer Checks (FORTIFY_SOURCE) |publisher=fedoraproject.org |accessdate=2009-03-11 }}</ref> a compiler directive that attempts to discover some [[buffer overflow]]s) are applied to the code. These work on multiple representations, mostly the architecture-independent GIMPLE representation and the architecture-dependent [[Register transfer language|RTL]] representation. Finally, [[machine code]] is produced using architecture-specific [[pattern matching]] originally based on an algorithm of Jack Davidson and Chris Fraser.\n\nGCC was written primarily in [[C (programming language)|C]] except for parts of the [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] front end. The distribution includes the standard libraries for Ada, [[C++]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] whose code is mostly written in those languages.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ohloh.net/projects/gcc/analyses/latest | title = languages used to make GCC }}</ref><!-- primary source --> On some platforms, the distribution also includes a low-level runtime library, '''libgcc''', written in a combination of machine-independent C and processor-specific [[machine code]], designed primarily to handle arithmetic operations that the target processor cannot perform directly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Libgcc.html|title=GCC Internals|publisher=GCC.org|accessdate=March 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2010, the GCC steering committee decided to allow use of a [[C++]] compiler to compile GCC.<ref name=\"gcc-c++\">{{cite news | title = GCC allows C++&nbsp;\u2013 to some degree | url = http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/GCC-allows-C-to-some-degree-1012611.html | publisher = [[Heinz Heise|The H]] |date=June 1, 2010 }}</ref> The compiler was intended to be written in C plus a subset of features from C++. In particular, this was decided so that GCC's developers could use the [[Destructor (computer science)|destructors]] and [[Generic programming|generics]] features of C++.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-07/msg00518.html|title=An email by Richard Stallman on emacs-devel }}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012, the GCC steering committee announced that GCC now uses C++ as its implementation language.<ref>{{cite web|title=GCC 4.8 Release Series: Changes, New Features, and Fixes|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/changes.html|accessdate=October 4, 2013}}</ref> This means that to build GCC from sources, a C++ compiler is required that understands [[C++03|ISO/IEC C++03]] standard.\n\n=== Front ends ===\nEach [[front end (compiler)|front end]] uses a parser to produce the [[abstract syntax tree]] of a given [[source file]]. Due to the syntax tree abstraction, source files of any of the different supported languages can be processed by the same [[back end (Compiler)|back end]]. GCC started out using [[LALR parser]]s generated with [[GNU Bison|Bison]], but gradually switched to hand-written [[Recursive descent parser|recursive-descent parsers]]; for C++ in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.4/changes.html|title=GCC 3.4 Release Series Changes, New Features, and Fixes}}</ref> and for C and Objective-C in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.1/changes.html|title=GCC 4.1 Release Series Changes, New Features, and Fixes}}</ref> Currently{{When?|date=October 2018}} all front ends use hand-written recursive-descent parsers.\n\nUntil recently,{{When?|date=October 2018}} the tree representation of the program was not fully independent of the processor being targeted.\n\nThe meaning of a tree was somewhat different for different language front ends, and front ends could provide their own tree codes. This was simplified with the introduction of GENERIC and GIMPLE, two new forms of language-independent trees that were introduced with the advent of GCC 4.0. GENERIC is more complex, based on the GCC 3.x Java front end's intermediate representation. GIMPLE is a simplified GENERIC, in which various constructs are ''[[lowering (computer science)|lowered]]'' to multiple GIMPLE instructions. The [[C (Programming Language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] front ends produce GENERIC directly in the front end. Other front ends instead have different intermediate representations after parsing and convert these to GENERIC.\n\nIn either case, the so-called \"gimplifier\" then converts this more complex form into the simpler [[Static single assignment form|SSA]]-based GIMPLE form that is the common language for a large number of powerful language- and architecture-independent global (function scope) optimizations.\n\n=== GENERIC and GIMPLE ===\n''GENERIC'' is an [[intermediate representation]] language used as a \"middle end\" while compiling source code into [[executable|executable binaries]]. A subset, called ''GIMPLE'', is targeted by all the front ends of GCC.\n\nThe middle stage of GCC does all of the code analysis and [[optimizing compiler|optimization]], working independently of both the compiled language and the target architecture, starting from the GENERIC<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/GENERIC.html|title=GENERIC in GNU Compiler Collection Internals}}</ref> representation and expanding it to [[register transfer language]] (RTL). The GENERIC representation contains only the subset of the imperative [[computer programming|programming]] constructs optimized by the middle end.\n\nIn transforming the source code to GIMPLE,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/GIMPLE.html|title=GIMPLE in GNU Compiler Collection Internals}}</ref> complex [[Expression (programming)|expressions]] are split into a [[three-address code]] using [[temporary variable]]s. This representation was inspired by the SIMPLE representation proposed in the McCAT compiler<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-acaps.cs.mcgill.ca/info/McCAT/McCAT.html |title=McCAT |accessdate=2017-09-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040812030043/http://www-acaps.cs.mcgill.ca/info/McCAT/McCAT.html |archivedate=August 12, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> by Laurie J. Hendren<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/~hendren/|title=Laurie J. Hendren}}</ref> for simplifying the analysis and [[Optimization (computer science)|optimization]] of [[Imperative programming|imperative programs]].\n\n=== Optimization ===\nOptimization can occur during any phase of compilation; however, the bulk of optimizations are performed after the syntax and [[Semantic analysis (compiler)|semantic analysis]] of the front end and before the [[Code generation (compiler)|code generation]] of the back end; thus a common, even though somewhat contradictory, name for this part of the compiler is the \"middle end.\"\n\nThe exact set of GCC optimizations varies from release to release as it develops, but includes the standard algorithms, such as [[loop optimization]], [[jump threading]], [[common subexpression elimination]], [[instruction scheduling]], and so forth. The [[Register transfer language|RTL]] optimizations are of less importance with the addition of global SSA-based optimizations on [[GIMPLE]] trees,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redhat.com/magazine/002dec04/features/gcc/|title=From Source to Binary: The Inner Workings of GCC|last=Novillo|first=Diego|work=[[Red Hat#Red Hat Magazine|Red Hat Magazine]]|date=December 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401215553/http://www.redhat.com/magazine/002dec04/features/gcc/|archivedate=April 1, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> as RTL optimizations have a much more limited scope, and have less high-level information.\n\nSome of these optimizations performed at this level include [[dead code elimination]], [[partial redundancy elimination]], [[global value numbering]], [[sparse conditional constant propagation]], and [[scalar replacement of aggregates]]. Array dependence based optimizations such as [[automatic vectorization]] and [[automatic parallelization]] are also performed. [[Profile-guided optimization]] is also possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/install/build.html#TOC4|title=Profile-guided optimization is demonstrated here}}</ref>\n\n=== Back end ===\nThe GCC's back end is partly specified by [[C preprocessor|preprocessor macros]] and functions specific to a target architecture, for instance to define its [[endianness]], [[word size]], and [[calling convention]]s. The front part of the back end uses these to help decide RTL generation, so although GCC's RTL is nominally processor-independent, the initial sequence of abstract instructions is already adapted to the target. At any moment, the actual RTL instructions forming the program representation have to comply with the [[machine description]] of the target architecture.\n\nThe machine description file contains RTL patterns, along with operand constraints, and code snippets to output the final assembly. The constraints indicate that a particular RTL pattern might only apply (for example) to certain hardware registers, or (for example) allow immediate operand offsets of only a limited size (''e.g.'' 12, 16, 24, \u2026 bit offsets, etc.). During RTL generation, the constraints for the given target architecture are checked. In order to issue a given snippet of RTL, it must match one (or more) of the RTL patterns in the machine description file, and satisfy the constraints for that pattern; otherwise, it would be impossible to convert the final RTL into machine code.\n\nTowards the end of compilation, valid RTL is reduced to a ''strict'' form in which each instruction refers to real machine registers and a pattern from the target's machine description file. Forming strict RTL is a complicated task; an important step is [[register allocation]], where real hardware registers are chosen to replace the initially assigned pseudo-registers. This is followed by a \"reloading\" phase; any pseudo-registers that were not assigned a real hardware register are 'spilled' to the stack, and RTL to perform this spilling is generated. Likewise, offsets that are too large to fit into an actual instruction must be broken up and replaced by RTL sequences that will obey the offset constraints.\n\nIn the final phase, the machine code is built by calling a small snippet of code, associated with each pattern, to generate the real instructions from the target's [[instruction set]], using the final registers, offsets, and addresses chosen during the reload phase. The assembly-generation snippet may be just a string, in which case a simple string substitution of the registers, offsets, and/or addresses into the string is performed. The assembly-generation snippet may also be a short block of C code, performing some additional work, but ultimately returning a string containing the valid assembly code.\n\n=== Features ===\nSome features of GCC include:\n\n* [[Link-time optimization]] optimizes across object file boundaries to directly improve the linked binary. Link-time optimization relies on an intermediate file containing the serialization of some ''Gimple'' representation included in the object file.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The file is generated alongside the object file during source compilation. Each source compilation generates a separate object file and link-time helper file. When the object files are linked, the compiler is executed again and uses the helper files to optimize code across the separately compiled object files.\n* [[Plug-in (computing)|Plugins]] can extend the GCC compiler directly.<ref>{{cite web |title= Plugins |url= https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Plugins.html |work= GCC online documentation |accessdate= July 8, 2013 }}</ref> Plugins allow a stock compiler to be tailored to specific needs by external code loaded as plugins.

His theories dominated and influenced [[Western culture|Western]] medical science for more than 1,300 years.

However, in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] they continued to be studied and followed.

He was born in September AD 129.<ref name=\"nutton73\"/> His father, [[Aelius Nicon]], was a wealthy [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]], an architect and builder, with eclectic interests including philosophy, mathematics, logic, astronomy, agriculture and literature. Galen describes his father as a \"highly amiable, just, good and benevolent man\". At that time [[Pergamon]] (modern-day [[Bergama]], [[Turkey]]) was a major cultural and intellectual centre, noted for its [[Library of Pergamum|library]], second only to that in Alexandria,<ref name=\"brock\"/><ref name=\"metzger\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=NrEeAAAAIAAJ Metzger BM.

His studies also took in each of the principal philosophical systems of the time, including [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Epicurean]]. His father had planned a traditional career for Galen in philosophy or politics and took care to expose him to literary and philosophical influences. However, Galen states that in around AD 145 his father had a dream in which the god [[Asclepius]] (Aesculapius) appeared and commanded Nicon to send his son to study medicine. Again, no expense was spared, and following his earlier liberal education, at 16 he began studies at the prestigious local sanctuary or [[Asclepeion|Asclepieum]] dedicated to Asclepius, god of medicine, as a \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (''therapeutes'', or attendant) for four years. There he came under the influence of men like [[Aeschrion of Pergamon]], Stratonicus and Satyrus. Asclepiea functioned as spas or sanitoria to which the sick would come to seek the ministrations of the priesthood. Romans frequented the temple at Pergamon in search of medical relief from illness and disease. It was also the haunt of notable people such as Claudius Charax the historian, [[Aelius Aristides]] the orator, [[Polemon of Laodicea|Polemo]] the sophist, and Cuspius Rufinus the Consul.<ref name=\"nutton73\"/>\n\nIn 148, when he was 19, his father died, leaving him independently wealthy. He then followed the advice he found in Hippocrates' teaching<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daedalus.umkc.edu/hippocrates/HippocratesLoeb1/page.66.php?size=240x320|title=Hippocrates Collected Works I|website=daedalus.umkc.edu}}</ref> and travelled and studied widely including such destinations as [[Smyrna]] (now [[Izmir]]), [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]], [[Crete]], [[Cilicia]] (now [[\u00c7ukurova]]), [[Cyprus]], and finally the great medical school of [[Medicine in ancient Greece|Alexandria]], exposing himself to the various schools of thought in medicine. In 157, aged 28, he returned to Pergamon as physician to the gladiators of the High Priest of Asia, one of the most influential and wealthy men in Asia. Galen claims that the High Priest chose him over other physicians after he eviscerated an ape and challenged other physicians to repair the damage. When they refused, Galen performed the [[surgery]] himself and in so doing won the favor of the High Priest of Asia. Over his four years there, he learned the importance of diet, fitness, hygiene and preventive measures, as well as living anatomy, and the treatment of fractures and severe trauma, referring to their [[wounds]] as \"windows into the body\". Only five deaths among the gladiators occurred while he held the post, compared to sixty in his predecessor's time, a result that is in general ascribed to the attention he paid to their wounds. At the same time he pursued studies in theoretical medicine and philosophy.<ref name=\"nutton73\"/><ref name=\"ustun\">Ustun C. Galen and his anatomic eponym: Vein of Galen.

His impatience brought him into conflict with other doctors and he felt menaced by them. His demonstrations there antagonized the less skilled and more conservative physicians in the city.  When Galen's animosity with the Roman medical practitioners became serious, he feared he might be exiled or poisoned, so he left the city.<ref name=Eichholz>D.E.

Evans, 1956, ''Galen the Physician as Physiognomist'', American Philological Association</ref> During the autumn of 169 when Roman troops were returning to [[Aquileia]], a great plague broke out, and the emperor summoned Galen back to Rome. He was ordered to accompany Marcus and Verus to Germany as the court physician. The following spring Marcus was persuaded to release Galen after receiving a report that [[Asclepius]] was against the project.<ref name=Littman>R.J. Littman and M.L. Littman, 1973 Galen and the Antonine Plague, The American Journal of Philology 94 no. 3, p. 243\u2013255</ref> He was left behind to act as physician to the imperial heir [[Commodus]]. It was here in court that Galen wrote extensively on medical subjects. Ironically, Lucius Verus died in 169, and Marcus Aurelius himself died in 180, both victims of the plague.\n\nGalen was the physician to Commodus for much of the emperor\u2019s life and treated his common illnesses. According to Dio Cassius 72.14.3\u20134, in about 189, under Commodus\u2019 reign, a pestilence occurred which at its height killed 2,000 people a day in Rome. This was most likely the same plague that struck Rome during Marcus Aurelius\u2019 reign.<ref name=Littman/>\n\nGalen became physician to [[Septimius Severus]] during his reign in Rome. Galen compliments Severus and [[Caracalla]] on keeping a supply of drugs for their friends and mentions three cases in which they had been of use in 198.<ref name=Eichholz/>\n\n===The Antonine Plague===\n{{Main|Antonine Plague}}\n[[File:Galenosgruppe (Wiener Dioskurides).jpg|thumb|The 'Galen' group of physicians in an image from the [[Vienna Dioscurides]]; he is depicted top center.]]\nThe Antonine Plague was named after Marcus Aurelius\u2019 family name of Antoninus. It was also known as the Plague of Galen and held an important place in medicinal history because of its association with Galen. He had first-hand knowledge of the disease, and was present in Rome when it first struck in 166 AD, and was also present in the winter of 168\u201369 during an outbreak among troops stationed at [[Aquileia]]. He had experience with the epidemic, referring to it as very long lasting, and described its symptoms and his treatment of it. Unfortunately, his references to the plague are scattered and brief. Galen was not trying to present a description of the disease so that it could be recognized in future generations; he was more interested in the treatment and physical effects of the disease. For example, in his writings about a young man afflicted with the plague, he concentrated on the treatment of internal and external ulcerations. According to Niebuhr, \"this pestilence must have raged with incredible fury; it carried off innumerable victims. The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted upon it by the plague that visited it in the reign of M. Aurelius.\"\nThe mortality rate of the plague was 7\u201310 percent; the outbreak in 165\u2013168 would have caused approximately 3.5 to 5 million deaths. [[Otto Seeck]] believes that over half the population of the empire perished. J. F. Gilliam believes that the Antonine plague probably caused more deaths than any other epidemic during the empire before the mid-3rd century.<ref name=Littman/> It is believed that the Antonine Plague was [[smallpox]], because though his description is incomplete, Galen gave enough information to enable a firm identification of the disease.\n\nGalen notes that the [[exanthema]] covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby where there was no ulceration. He states that those who were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually in the form of a blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one [[Thucydides]] described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, [[catarrh]], cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.<ref name=Littman/>\n\n===Eudemus===\nWhen the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher Eudemus became ill with [[Plasmodium malariae|quartan fever]], Galen felt obliged to treat him \"since he was my teacher and I happened to live nearby.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1641</ref> Galen wrote: \"I return to the case of Eudemus. He was thoroughly attacked by the three attacks of quartan ague, and the doctors had given him up, as it was now mid-winter.\"<ref>Arthur John Brock, 1929, ''Greek Medicine'', London: J.M. Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 207.</ref> Some Roman physicians criticized Galen for his use of the [[prognosis]] in his treatment of Eudemus. This practice conflicted with the then-current [[Standard of care#Medical standard of care|standard of care]], which relied upon [[divination]] and [[mysticism]]. Galen retaliated against his detractors by defending his own methods. Garcia-Ballester quotes Galen as saying: \"In order to diagnose, one must observe and reason. This was the basis of his criticism of the doctors who proceeded alogos and askeptos.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1663</ref> However, Eudemus warned Galen that engaging in conflict with these physicians could lead to his assassination. \"Eudemus said this, and more to the same effect; he added that if they were not able to harm me by unscrupulous conduct they would proceed to attempts at poisoning. Among other things he told me that, some ten years before, a young man had come to the city and had given, like me practical demonstrations of the resources of our art; this young man was put to death by poison, together with two servants who accompanied him.\"<ref>Arthur John Brock, 1929, ''Greek Medicine'', London: J.M. Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 212.</ref>\n\nGarcia-Ballester says the following of Galen\u2019s use of prognosis: \"In modern medicine, we are used to distinguishing between the diagnostic judgment (the scientific knowledge of what a patient has) and the prognostic judgment (the conjecture about what will happen to him.) Galen, like the Hippocratics, was not. For him, to understand a clinical case technically, \u2018to diagnose\u2019, was, among other things, to know with greater or lesser certainty the outcome for the patient, \u2018to prognosticate\u2019. Prognosis, then, is one of the essential problems and most important objectives of Galenic diagnosis. Galen was concerned to distinguish it from divination or prophecy, both to improve diagnosis technically and to enhance the physician's reputation.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1640</ref>\n\n===Death===\nThe 11th-century ''[[Suda]]'' lexicon states that Galen died at the age of 70, which would place his death in about the year 199. However, there is a reference in Galen's treatise ''\"On Theriac to Piso\"'' (which may, however, be spurious) to events of 204. There are also statements in Arabic sources<ref>Amari, M. Biblioteca Arabo-sicula, 2nd vol., Loscher, Turin, Rome, p. 503-504.</ref> that he died in Sicily at age 87, after 17 years studying medicine and 70 practicing it, which would mean he died about 217. According to these sources, the tomb of Galenus in [[Palermo]] was still well preserved in tenth century. Nutton<ref>Nutton V. Ancient Medicine. Routledge, 2004 226\u20137</ref> believes that ''\"On Theriac to Piso\"'' is genuine, that the Arabic sources are correct, and that the ''Suda'' has erroneously interpreted the 70 years of Galen's career in the Arabic tradition as referring to his whole lifespan.

Under [[Hippocrates]]' bodily [[humors]] theory, differences in human moods come as a consequence of imbalances in one of the four [[Body fluid|bodily fluids]]: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Galen promoted this theory and the typology of [[Four temperaments|human temperaments]]. In Galen's view, an imbalance of each humor corresponded with a particular human temperament (blood\u2014sanguine, black bile\u2014melancholic, yellow bile\u2014choleric, and phlegm\u2014phlegmatic). Thus, individuals with sanguine temperaments are extroverted and social; choleric people have energy, passion, and charisma; melancholics are creative, kind, and considerate; and phlegmatic temperaments are characterized by dependability, kindness, and affection.<ref name=MarkGrant>Mark Grant, 2000, Galen on Food and Diet, Routledge]</ref>\n\n[[File:Claudius Galenus (1906) - Veloso Salgado.png|thumb|left|Galen dissecting a monkey, as imagined by [[Veloso Salgado]] in 1906]]\n\nGalen's principal interest was in human anatomy, but Roman law had prohibited the dissection of human cadavers since about 150 BC.<ref>'Tragically, the prohibition of human dissection by Rome in 150 BC arrested this progress and few of their findings survived', Arthur Aufderheide, 'The Scientific Study of Mummies' (2003), page 5</ref> Because of this restriction, Galen performed anatomical dissections on living ([[vivisection]]) and dead animals, mostly focusing on pigs and [[primate]]s.<ref name=\"brock\"/> This work was useful because Galen believed that the anatomical structures of these animals closely mirrored those of humans.

In the middle of the 16th century, the anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] challenged the anatomical knowledge of Galen by conducting dissections on human cadavers. These investigations allowed Vesalius to refute aspects of Galen's anatomy.\n\nAmong Galen's major contributions to medicine was his work on the [[circulatory system]]. He was the first to recognize that there are distinct differences between [[venous blood|venous]] (dark) and [[artery|arterial]] (bright) blood. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more complete understanding of the circulatory system, [[nervous system]], [[respiratory system]], and other structures, his work contained scientific errors.<ref name=\"Galen on the brain\"/> Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the [[rete mirabile]] in the carotid sinus.<ref name=MarkGrant/> Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later (beginning with works of [[Ibn al-Nafis]] published ca. 1242) shown to be incorrect.<ref name=Furley1984>Furley, D, and J.

Many of his procedures and techniques would not be used again for centuries, such as the procedures he performed on brains and eyes.<ref name=\"Galen on the brain\"/> To correct [[cataract]]s in patients, Galen performed an operation similar to a modern one.

This was sharply criticised by the [[Erasistratus|Erasistrateans]], who predicted dire outcomes, believing that it was not blood but ''[[Pneuma (Stoic)|pneuma]]'' that flowed in the veins. Galen, however, staunchly defended venesection in his three books on the subject<ref>Brain P (trans.) Galen on Bloodletting: A study of the origins, development, and validity of his opinions, with a translation of the three works. Cambridge 1986</ref> and in his demonstrations and public disputations.\n\n==Contributions to philosophy==\n{{See also|Philosophy of medicine}}\n\nAlthough the main focus of his work was on medicine, anatomy, and physiology, Galen also wrote about logic and philosophy. His writings were influenced by earlier Greek and Roman thinkers, including [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. Galen was concerned to combine philosophical thought with medical practice, as in his brief work ''That the Best Physician is also a Philosopher'' he took aspects from each group and combined them with his original thought. He regarded medicine as an interdisciplinary field that was best practiced by utilizing theory, observation, and experimentation in conjunction.\n\nSeveral schools of thought existed within the medical field during Galen's lifetime, the main two being the Empiricists and Rationalists (also called Dogmatists or Philosophers), with the Methodists being a smaller group. The Empiricists emphasized the importance of physical practice and experimentation, or \"active learning\" in the medical discipline. In direct opposition to the Empiricists were the Rationalists, who valued the study of established teachings in order to create new theories in the name of medical advancements. The Methodists formed somewhat of a middle ground, as they were not as experimental as the Empiricists, nor as theoretical as the Rationalists. The Methodists mainly utilized pure observation, showing greater interest in studying the natural course of ailments than making efforts to find remedies. Galen's education had exposed him to the five major schools of thought (Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics, Epicureans, Pyrrhonists), with teachers from the Rationalist sect and from the Empiricist sect.\n\n=== Opposition to the Stoics ===\nGalen was well known for his advancements in medicine and the circulatory system, but he was also concerned with philosophy.

These passions were considered to be even stronger than regular emotions, and, as a consequence, more dangerous.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> The third part of the soul, or the appetitive spirit, controlled the living forces in our body, most importantly blood.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> The appetitive spirit also regulated the pleasures of the body and was moved by feelings of enjoyment. This third part of the soul is the animalistic, or more natural, side of the soul, it deals with the natural urges of the body and survival instincts. Galen proposed that when the soul is moved by too much enjoyment, it reaches states of \"incontinence\" and \"licentiousness\", the inability to willfully cease enjoyment, which was a negative consequence of too much pleasure.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" />\n\nIn order to unite his theories about the soul and how it operated within the body, he adapted the theory of the pneuma,<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> which he used to explain how the soul operated within its assigned organs, and how those organs, in turn, interacted together. Galen then distinguished the vital pneuma, in the arterial system, from the psychic pneuma, in the brain and nervous system.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> Galen placed the vital pneuma in the heart and the psychic pneuma within the brain. He conducted many anatomical studies on animals, most famously an ox, to study the transition from vital to psychic pneuma.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> Although highly criticized for comparing animal anatomy to human anatomy, Galen was convinced that his knowledge was abundant enough in both anatomies to base one on the other.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" />\n\n== Mind\u2013body problem ==\n{{further|Mind\u2013body problem}}\n\nGalen believed there to be no distinction between the mental and the physical.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> This was a controversial argument of the time, and Galen fell with the Greeks in believing that the mind and body were not separate faculties.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> He believed that this could be scientifically proven.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> This was where his opposition to the Stoics became most prevalent.<ref name=\"gill2007\" /> Galen proposed organs within the body to be responsible for specific functions, rather than individual parts. According to Galen, the Stoics' lack of scientific justification discredited their claims of the separateness of mind and body, which is why he spoke so strongly against them.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" />\n\n== Psychotherapy ==\nAnother one of Galen's major works, ''On the Diagnosis and Cure of the Soul's Passion,'' discussed how to approach and treat psychological problems.<ref name=\"king2009\" /> This was Galen's early attempt at what would later be called [[psychotherapy]]. His book contained directions on how to provide counsel to those with psychological issues to prompt them to reveal their deepest passions and secrets, and eventually cure them of their mental deficiency. The leading individual, or therapist, had to be a male, preferably of an older, wiser, age, as well as free from the control of the passions.<ref name=\"king2009\" /> These passions, according to Galen, caused the psychological problems that people experienced.\n\n==Published works==\n{{Main|Galenic corpus}}\n[[Image:Galeni De curandi ratione V00212 00000008.tif|thumb|''De curandi ratione'']]\n[[File:Galenou Apanta.tif|thumb|''Galenou apanta'' (1538)]]\nGalen may have produced more work than any author in antiquity, rivaling the quantity of work issued from [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name=\"kotrc\">Kotrc RF, Walters KR.

However, in general, Galen and the [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greek medical tradition]] continued to be studied and followed in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], commonly known as the Byzantine Empire. All of the extant Greek manuscripts of Galen were copied by Byzantine scholars. In the Abbasid period (after AD 750) [[Arab Muslims]] began to be interested in Greek scientific and medical texts for the first time, and had some of Galen's texts translated into Arabic, often by Syrian Christian scholars (see below). As a result, some texts of Galen exist only in Arabic translation,<ref name=\"iep\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/g/galen.htm|title=Galen - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu}}</ref> while others exist only in medieval Latin translations of the Arabic.

Although written in Greek, by convention the works are referred to by Latin titles, and often by merely abbreviations of those. No single authoritative collection of his work exists, and controversy remains as to the authenticity of a number of works attributed to Galen. As a consequence, research on Galen's work is fraught with hazard.<ref name=\"metzger\"/><ref name=\"kotrc\"/>\n\nVarious attempts have been made to classify Galen's vast output. For instance Coxe (1846) lists a Prolegomena, or introductory books, followed by 7 classes of treatise embracing Physiology (28 vols.), Hygiene (12), Aetiology (19), Semeiotics (14), Pharmacy (10), Blood letting (4) and Therapeutics (17), in addition to 4 of aphorisms, and spurious works.<ref name=\"Coxe\">[[John Redman Coxe|Coxe, John Redman]], [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1988&chapter=128229&layout=html&Itemid=27 ''The Writings of Hippocrates and Galen.

Over 20,000 pages in length, it is divided into 22 volumes, with 676 index pages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Many of Galen's works are included in the ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]]'', a digital library of Greek literature started in 1972. Another useful modern source is the French [http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/histmed/medica/galien_va.htm Biblioth\u00e8que interuniversitaire de m\u00e9decine] (BIUM).\n\n==Legacy==\n===Late antiquity===\nIn his time, Galen's reputation as both physician and philosopher was legendary,<ref name=\"nutton84a\">Nutton V. Galen in the eyes of his contemporaries. BHM 58(3) fall 1984 315\u201324</ref> the Emperor Marcus Aurelius describing him as \"Primum sane medicorum esse, philosophorum autem solum\" (first among doctors and unique among philosophers ''Praen 14: 660''). Other contemporary authors in the Greek world confirm this including [[Theodotus of Byzantium|Theodotus the Shoemaker]], [[Athenaeus]] and [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]. The 7th-century poet [[George Pisida|George of Pisida]] went so far as to refer to Christ as a second and neglected Galen.<ref>George of Pisida. Hexameron 1.1588f</ref> Galen continued to exert an important influence over the theory and practice of medicine until the mid-17th century in the Byzantine and Arabic worlds and Europe. Hippocrates and Galen form important landmarks of 600 years of Greek medicine. A. J. Brock describes them as representing the foundation and apex respectively.<ref name=\"brock\">Arthur John Brock (translator), ''Introduction. Galen. On the Natural Faculties''. Edinburgh 1916</ref> A few centuries after Galen, [[Palladius (physician)|Palladius Iatrosophista]] stated, in his commentary on Hippocrates, that Hippocrates sowed and Galen reaped.\n\nThus Galen summarised and synthesised the work of his predecessors, and it is in Galen's words (Galenism) that Greek medicine was handed down to subsequent generations, such that Galenism became the means by which Greek medicine was known to the world. Often, this was in the form of restating and reinterpreting, such as in [[Magnus of Nisibis]]' 4th-century work on urine, which was in turn translated into Arabic.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/> Yet the full importance of his contributions was not appreciated till long after his death.<ref name=\"brock\"/> Galen's rhetoric and prolificity were so powerful as to convey the impression that there was little left to learn. The term Galenism has subsequently taken on both a positive and pejorative meaning as one that transformed medicine in late antiquity yet so dominated subsequent thinking as to stifle further progress.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/>\n\nAfter the collapse of the Western Empire the study of Galen and other Greek works almost disappeared in the Latin West. In contrast, in the predominantly Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman empire (Byzantium), many commentators of the subsequent centuries, such as [[Oribasius]], physician to the emperor [[Julian the apostate|Julian]] who compiled a ''Synopsis'' in the 4th century, preserved and disseminated Galen's works, making Galenism more accessible. Nutton refers to these authors as the \"medical refrigerators of antiquity\".<ref name=\"brock\"/><ref name=\"nutton84\"/> In late antiquity, medical writing veered increasingly in the direction of the theoretical at the expense of the practical, with many authors merely debating Galenism. Magnus of Nisibis was a pure theorist, as were [[John of Alexandria]] and Agnellus of Ravenna with their lectures on Galen's ''De Sectis''.<ref>Temkin O. Studies on late Alexandrian medicine. Bull Hist Med 3: 405\u201330, 1935</ref> So strong was Galenism that other authors such as Hippocrates began to be seen through a Galenic lens, while his opponents became marginalised and other medical sects such as Asclepiadism slowly disappeared.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/> Greek medicine was part of Greek culture, and Syrian Eastern Christians came in contact with it while the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantium) ruled Syria and Western Mesopotamia, regions that were conquered from Byzantium in the 7th century by Arab Muslims. After AD 750, Muslims had these Syrian Christians make the first translations of Galen into Arabic. From then on, Galen and the Greek medical tradition in general became assimilated into the medieval and early modern Islamic Middle East.<ref name=\"brock\"/>\n\n===Influence on medicine in the Islamic world===\n{{further|Medicine in the medieval Islamic world}}\n\nGalen's approach to medicine became and remains influential in the Islamic world. The first major translator of Galen into Arabic was the Syrian Christian [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]]. He translated (c. 830\u2013870) 129 works of \"Jalinos\"<ref>[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7100.html Dear P. Revolutionizing the Sciences: European Knowledge and Its Ambitions, 1500\u20131700.

Arabic sources, such as [[Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi|Rhazes]] (Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi AD 865\u2013925), continue to be the source of discovery of new or relatively inaccessible Galenic writings.<ref name=\"nuttonchoice\"/> One of Hunayn's Arabic translations, ''Kitab ila Aglooqan fi Shifa al Amrad'', which is extant in the Library of [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences|Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine & Sciences]], is regarded as a masterpiece of Galen's literary works. A part of the Alexandrian compendium of Galen's work, this 10th-century manuscript comprises two parts that include details regarding various types of fevers (Humyat) and different inflammatory conditions of the body. More important is that it includes details of more than 150 single and compound formulations of both herbal and animal origin. The book provides an insight into understanding the traditions and methods of treatment in the Greek and Roman eras. In addition, this book provides a direct source for the study of more than 150 single and compound drugs used during the Greco-Roman period.\n\nAs the title of ''Doubts on Galen'' by Rhazes implies, as well as the writings of physicians such as [[Ibn Zuhr]] (Avenzoar) and [[Ibn al-Nafis]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reflections Chairman's | year = 2004 | title = Traditional Medicine Among Gulf Arabs, Part II: Blood-letting | url = | journal = Heart Views | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 74\u201385 [80] }}</ref> the works of Galen were not accepted unquestioningly, but as a challengeable basis for further [[Scientific method|inquiry]]. A strong emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and [[empiricism]] led to new results and new observations, which were contrasted and combined with those of Galen by writers such as Rhazes, [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi]] (Haly Abbas), [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (Abulasis), [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), Ibn Zuhr and Ibn al-Nafis. For example, the experiments carried out by R\u0101zi and Ibn Zuhr contradicted the Galenic theory of humorism,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} while Ibn al-Nafis' discovery of the [[pulmonary circulation]] contradicted the Galenic theory on the heart.<ref name=\"Dabbagh\">{{cite journal | author = Al-Dabbagh S.

From that time, Galenism took on a new, unquestioned authority, Galen even being referred to as the \"Medical Pope of the Middle Ages\".<ref name=\"brock\"/> [[Constantine the African]] was amongst those who translated both Hippocrates and Galen from Arabic. In addition to the more numerous translations of Arabic texts in this period, there were a few translations of Galenic works directly from the Greek, such as [[Burgundio of Pisa]]'s translation of ''De complexionibus''. Galen's works on anatomy and medicine became the mainstay of the medieval physician's university curriculum, alongside Ibn Sina's ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', which elaborated on Galen's works. Unlike pagan Rome, Christian Europe did not exercise a universal prohibition of the dissection and autopsy of the human body and such examinations were carried out regularly from at least the 13th century.<ref>P Prioreschi, Determinants of the revival of dissection of the human body in the Middle Ages', Medical Hypotheses (2001) 56(2), 229\u2013234</ref> However, Galen's influence was so great that when dissections discovered anomalies compared with Galen's anatomy, the physicians often tried to fit these into the Galenic system. An example of this is [[Mondino de Liuzzi]], who describes rudimentary blood circulation in his writings but still asserts that the left ventricle should contain air. Some cited these changes as proof that human anatomy had changed since the time of Galen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Raymond F.|title=Stories of Great Physicians|publisher=Whitman|year=1963|pages=46\u201347|chapter=The Anatomist}}</ref>\n\nThe most important translator of Galen's works into Latin was Niccol\u00f2 di Deoprepio da Reggio, who spent several years working on Galen. Niccol\u00f2 worked at the Angevin Court during the reign of king [[Robert, King of Naples|Robert of Naples]]. Among Niccol\u00f2's translations is a piece from a medical treatise by Galen, of which the original text is lost.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Roberto|title=The Dawn of Humanism in Italy|year=1947|publisher=H.

Venice, 1565]]\n\nThe Renaissance, and the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall of the Byzantine Empire]] (1453), were accompanied by an influx of Greek scholars and manuscripts to the West, allowing direct comparison between the Arabic commentaries and the original Greek texts of Galen. This [[New Learning]] and the [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] movement, particularly the work of [[Thomas Linacre|Linacre]], promoted ''[[literae humaniores]]'' including Galen in the Latin scientific canon, ''De Naturalibus Facultatibus'' appearing in London in 1523. Debates on medical science now had two traditions, the more conservative Arabian and the liberal Greek.<ref name=\"brock\"/> The more extreme liberal movements began to challenge the role of authority in medicine, as exemplified by [[Paracelsus]]' symbolically burning the works of Avicenna and Galen at his medical school in [[University of Basel|Basle]].<ref name=\"brock\"/> Nevertheless, Galen's pre-eminence amongst the great thinkers of the millennium is exemplified by a 16th-century mural in the refectory of the [[Great Lavra]] of [[Mt Athos]].

Vesalius' most famous work, ''De humani corporis fabrica'', was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form. Seeking to examine critically Galen's methods and outlook, Vesalius turned to human cadaver dissection as a means of verification. Galen's writings were shown by Vesalius to describe details present in monkeys but not in humans, and he demonstrated Galen's limitations through books and hands-on demonstrations despite fierce opposition from orthodox pro-Galenists such as [[Jacques Dubois|Jacobus Sylvius]]. Since Galen states that he is using observations of monkeys (human dissection was prohibited) to give an account of what the body looks like, Vesalius could portray himself as using Galen's approach of description of direct observation to create a record of the exact details of the human body, since he worked in a time when human dissection was allowed. Galen argued that monkey anatomy was close enough to humans for physicians to learn anatomy with monkey dissections and then make observations of similar structures in the wounds of their patients, rather than trying to learn anatomy only from wounds in human patients, as would be done by students trained in the Empiricist model.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cosans C | year = 1997 | title = Galen's Critique of Rationalist and Empiricist Anatomy | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 35\u201354 | doi = 10.1023/A:1004266427468 | pmid = 11618979 }}</ref> The examinations of Vesalius also disproved medical theories of [[Aristotle]] and [[Mondino de Liuzzi]]. One of the best known examples of Vesalius' overturning of Galenism was his demonstration that the [[interventricular septum]] of the heart was not permeable, as Galen had taught (''Nat Fac III xv''). However, this had been revealed two years before by Michael Servetus in his fateful \"''Christianismi restitutio''\" (1553) with only three copies of the book surviving, but these remaining hidden for decades; the rest were burned shortly after its publication because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.\n\n[[Michael Servetus]], using the name \"Michel de Villeneuve\" during his stay in France, was [[Vesalius]]' fellow student and the best Galenist at the University of Paris, according to [[Johann Winter von Andernach]],<ref>2011 \"The love for truth.

In Acts 2, the followers of Christ receive the [[Holy Spirit]] and speak in the languages of at least fifteen countries or ethnic groups.\n\nThe exact phrase ''speaking in tongues'' has been used at least since the translation of the New Testament into [[Middle English]] in the [[Wycliffe Bible]] in the 14th century.<ref>{{Bibleref|Mark|16:17|53}} in [[Wycliffe's Bible]]</ref> [[Frederic Farrar]] first used the word ''glossolalia'' in 1879.<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed, 1989</ref>\n\n==Linguistics==\nIn 1972, William J. Samarin, a linguist from the University of Toronto, published a thorough assessment of Pentecostal glossolalia that became a classic work on its linguistic characteristics.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William J. |last=Samarin |title=Tongues of Men and Angels: The Religious Language of Pentecostalism |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1972 |oclc=308527}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref> His assessment was based on a large sample of glossolalia recorded in public and private Christian meetings in Italy, The Netherlands, Jamaica, Canada, and the United States over the course of five years; his wide range of subjects included the Puerto Ricans of the Bronx, the [[Snake handling|snake handlers]] of the Appalachians and the [[Spiritual Christians]] from Russia in Los Angeles (''Pryguny, Dukh-i-zhizniki'').\n\nSamarin found that glossolalic speech does resemble human language in some respects. The speaker uses accent, rhythm, intonation and pauses to break up the speech into distinct units. Each unit is itself made up of syllables, the syllables being formed from consonants and vowels taken from a language known to the speaker:\n\n<blockquote>It is verbal behaviour that consists of using a certain number of consonants and vowels...in a limited number of syllables that in turn are organized into larger units that are taken apart and rearranged pseudogrammatically...with variations in pitch, volume, speed and intensity.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William J. |last=Samarin |title=Tongues of Men and Angels: The Religious Language of Pentecostalism |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1972 |page=120 |oclc=308527}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>[Glossolalia] consists of strings of syllables, made up of sounds taken from all those that the speaker knows, put together more or less haphazardly but emerging nevertheless as word-like and sentence-like units because of realistic, language-like rhythm and melody.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samarin |first=William J. |title=Sociolinguistic vs. Neurophysiological Explanations for Glossolalia: Comment on Goodman's Paper |jstor=1384556 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=1972 |pages=293\u201396 |doi=10.2307/1384556}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThat the sounds are taken from the set of sounds already known to the speaker is confirmed by others. [[Felicitas Goodman]], a psychological anthropologist and linguist, also found that the speech of glossolalists reflected the patterns of speech of the speaker's native language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goodman |first=Felicitas D. |title=Phonetic Analysis of Glossolalia in Four Cultural Settings |jstor=1384336 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=1969 |pages=227\u201335 |doi=10.2307/1384336}}</ref> These findings were confirmed by Kavan (2004).<ref>New Zealand Linguistic Society: Heather Kavan [[Massey University]]: [http://www.nzlingsoc.org/documents/Kavan.pdf Heather Kavan \u201cWe don't know what we're saying, but it's profound\u201d]</ref>\n\nSamarin found that the resemblance to human language was merely on the surface and so concluded that glossolalia is \"only a facade of language\".<ref name=Samarin128>{{Cite book|first=William J. |last=Samarin |title=Tongues of Men and Angels: The Religious Language of Pentecostalism |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1972 |page=128 |oclc=308527}}</ref>  He reached this conclusion because the syllable string did not form words, the stream of speech was not internally organized, and \u2013 most importantly of all \u2013 there was no systematic relationship between units of speech and concepts. Humans use language to communicate but glossolalia does not. Therefore, he concluded that glossolalia is not \"a specimen of human language because it is neither internally organized nor systematically related to the world man perceives\".<ref name=\"Samarin128\"/> On the basis of his linguistic analysis, Samarin defined Pentecostal glossolalia as \"meaningless but phonologically structured human [[utterance]], believed by the speaker to be a real language but bearing no systematic resemblance to any natural language, living or dead\".<ref>{{Cite book|first=William J. |last=Samarin |title=Tongues of Men and Angels: The Religious Language of Pentecostalism |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1972 |page=2 |oclc=308527}}</ref>\n\nPractitioners of glossolalia may disagree with linguistic researchers and claim that they are speaking human languages ([[xenoglossia]]). Felicitas Goodman studied a number of Pentecostal communities in the United States, the Caribbean, and Mexico; these included English-, Spanish- and Mayan-speaking groups. She compared what she found with recordings of non-Christian rituals from Africa, Borneo, Indonesia and Japan. She took into account both the segmental structure (such as sounds, syllables, phrases) and the supra-segmental elements (rhythm, accent, intonation) and concluded that there was no distinction between what was practised by the Pentecostal Protestants and the followers of other religions.<ref name=\"Goodman 1972\">{{Cite book|first=Felicitas D. |last=Goodman |authorlink=Felicitas Goodman |title=Speaking in Tongues: A Cross-Cultural Study in Glossolalia |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=1972 |pages= |isbn=978-0-226-30324-6 |oclc=393056}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Classical antiquity===\nIt was a commonplace idea within the [[Greco-Roman]] world that divine beings spoke languages different from human languages, and historians of religion have identified references to [[esoteric]] speech in Greco-Roman literature that resemble glossolalia, sometimes explained as angelic or [[divine language]]. An example is the account in the [[Testament of Job]], a non-canonical elaboration of the [[Book of Job]], where the daughters of [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] are described as being given sashes enabling them to speak and sing in angelic languages.{{Sfn | Martin | 1995 | pp = 88\u201389}}\n\nAccording to Dale B. Martin, glossolalia accorded high status in the ancient world due to its association with the divine.

Many other worship experiences in the Kirtland Temple prior to and after the dedication included references to people speaking and interpreting tongues. In describing the beliefs of the church in the [[Wentworth letter]] (1842), Joseph Smith identified a belief of the \"gift of tongues\" and \"interpretation of tongues\". The practice of glossolalia by the Latter-day Saints was widespread but after an initial burst of enthusiastic growth circa 1830\u201334, seems to have been somewhat more restrained than in many other contemporary religious movements.<ref name=\"Copeland\"/> Young, Smith, and numerous other early leaders frequently cautioned against the public exercise of glossolalia unless there was someone who could exercise the corresponding spiritual gift of interpretation of tongues, so that listeners could be edified by what had been said. Although the [[Latter-day Saint]]s believe that speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues are alive and well in the Church, modern Mormons are much more likely to point to the way in which LDS missionaries are trained and learn foreign languages quickly, and are able to communicate rapidly on their missions, as evidence of the manifestation of this gift. This interpretation stems from a 1900 General Conference sermon by [[Joseph F. Smith]] which discouraged glossolalia; subsequent leaders echoed this recommendation for about a decade afterwards and subsequently the practice had largely died out amongst Mormons by the 1930s and '40s.<ref name=\"Copeland\"/> The visitor to 21st Century LDS church services will never hear spontaneous, incomprehensible glossolalia as one might overhear at a Pentecostal service.\n\n===20th century===\n{{Main|Azusa Street Revival}}\n[[File:026 la times.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.25|Headline about the \"Weird babel of tongues\" and other behavior at Azusa Street, from a 1906 [[Los Angeles Times]] newspaper.]]\nDuring the 20th century, glossolalia primarily became associated with Pentecostalism and the later [[charismatic movement]]. The [[Holiness Movement|holiness]] preachers [[Charles Parham]] and [[William J. Seymour|William Seymour]] are credited as co-founders of the movement. Parham and Seymour taught that \"baptism of the Holy Spirit was not the blessing of sanctification but rather a [[third work of grace]] that was accompanied by the experience of tongues.\"<ref name=\"FahlbuschBromiley1999\"/> It was Parham who formulated the doctrine of \"initial evidence\". After studying the Bible, Parham came to the conclusion that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence that one had received the [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]].\n\nIn 1900, Parham opened [[Bethel Bible College]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]], America, where he taught initial evidence. During a service on 1 January 1901, a student named [[Agnes Ozman]] asked for prayer and the [[laying on of hands]] to specifically ask God to fill her with the [[Holy Spirit]]. She became the first of many students to experience glossolalia, coincidentally in [[Millennium#Counting years|the first hours of the 20th century]]. Parham followed within the next few days. Parham called his new movement the [[Charles Fox Parham|Apostolic Faith]]. In 1905, he moved to Houston and opened a [[Bible school]] there. One of his students was William Seymour, an African-American preacher. In 1906, Seymour traveled to [[Los Angeles]] where his preaching ignited the [[Azusa Street Revival]]. This revival is considered the birth of the global Pentecostal movement. Witnesses at the Azusa Street Revival wrote of seeing fire resting on the heads of participants, miraculous healings in the meetings, and incidents of speaking in tongues being understood by native speakers of the language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} According to the first issue of William Seymour's newsletter, \"The Apostolic Faith\", from 1906:\n\n{{quote|A Mohammedan, a Soudanese by birth, a [m]an who is an interpreter and speaks six[t]een languages, came into the meetings at Azusa Street and the Lord gave him messages which none but himself could understand.

From the time of the Azusa Street revival and among early participants in the Pentecostal movement, there were many accounts of individuals hearing their own languages spoken 'in tongues'. It is likely that the majority of Pentecostals and Charismatics still consider speaking in tongues to primarily be human languages.<ref>D.

From it grew many new Pentecostal churches as people visited the services in Los Angeles and took their newfound beliefs to communities around the United States and abroad.

During the 1960s, the [[charismatic movement]] within the [[Mainline Protestantism|mainline Protestant]] churches and among [[Catholic Charismatic Movement|charismatic Roman Catholics]] adopted some Pentecostal beliefs, and the practice of glossolalia spread to other Christian denominations. The discussion regarding tongues has permeated many branches of the Protestantism, particularly since the widespread Charismatic Movement in the 1960s.

It is neither xenoglossia nor miraculous, but rather learned behavior, possibly self-induced. These believe that what the New Testament described as \"speaking in tongues\" was xenoglossia, a miraculous spiritual gift through which the speaker could communicate in natural languages not previously studied.\n*A third position conceivably exists, which believes the practice of \"glossolalia\" to be a folk practice and different from the legitimate New Testament spiritual gift of speaking/interpreting real languages. It is therefore not out of a belief that \"miracles have ceased\" (i.e. Cessationism) that causes this group to discredit the supernatural origins of particular modern expressions of \"glossolalia\", but it is rather out of a belief that Glossolalists have misunderstood Scripture and wrongly attributed something that appears to be explained naturalistically<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/07/health/07brain.html|title=A Neuroscientific Look at Speaking in Tongues|first=Benedict|last=Carey|publisher=}}</ref> to the Holy Spirit.\n\nProponents of each viewpoint use the biblical writings and historical arguments to support their positions.\n\n===Biblical practice===\nThere are five places in the [[New Testament]] where speaking in tongues is referred to ''explicitly'':\n* [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Mark#Chapter 16|Mark 16:17]], which records the instructions of [[Jesus christ|Christ]] to the [[apostles]], including his description that \"they will speak with new tongues\" as a sign that would follow \"them that believe\" in him.\n* [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 2|Acts 2]], which describes an occurrence of speaking in tongues in [[Jerusalem]] at [[Pentecost]], though with various interpretations. Specifically, \"every man ''heard them'' speak in his own language\" and wondered \"how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?\"\n* [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 10|Acts 10:46]], when the household of [[Cornelius the Centurion|Cornelius]] in [[Caesarea]] spoke in tongues, and those present compared it to the speaking in tongues that occurred at [[Pentecost]].\n* [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 19|Acts 19:6]], when a group of approximately a dozen men spoke in tongues in [[Ephesus]] as they received the Holy Spirit while the apostle Paul laid his hands upon them.\n* [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 12|1 Cor 12]], [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 13|13]], [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 14|14]], where [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] discusses speaking in \"various kinds of tongues\" as part of his wider discussion of the [[gifts of the Spirit]]; his remarks shed some light on his own speaking in tongues as well as how the gift of speaking in tongues was to be used in the [[Ecclesia (church)|church]].\n\nOther verses by inference may be considered to refer to \"speaking in tongues\", such as [[s:Bible (King James)/Isaiah#Chapter 28|Isaiah 28:11]], [[s:Bible (King James)/Romans#Chapter 8|Romans 8:26]] and [[s:Bible (King James)/Jude|Jude 20]].\n\nThe biblical account of [[Pentecost]] in the second chapter of the book of Acts describes the sound of a mighty rushing wind and \"divided tongues like fire\" coming to rest on the [[apostles]].  The text further describes that \"they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages\". It goes on to say in verses 5-11 that when the Apostles spoke, each person in attendance \"heard their own language being spoken\". Therefore, the gift of speaking in tongues refers to the Apostles' speaking languages that the people listening heard as \"them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God\". Glossolalists and cessationists both recognize this as [[xenoglossia]], a miraculous ability that marked their [[Baptism of the Holy Spirit|baptism in the Holy Spirit]]. Something similar (although perhaps not xenoglossia) took place on at least two subsequent occasions, in Caesarea and Ephesus.\n\nGlossolalists and cessationists generally agree that the primary purpose of the gift of speaking in tongues was to mark the [[Holy Spirit]] being poured out.  At [[Pentecost]] the [[Apostle Peter]] declared that this gift, which was making some in the audience ridicule the disciples as drunks, was the fulfilment of the prophecy of [[Joel (prophet)|Joel]] which described that God would pour out his Spirit on all flesh ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 2|Acts 2:17]]).<ref name=ag-baptism2000/>\n\nDespite these commonalities, there are significant variations in interpretation.\n* '''Universal'''. The traditional [[Pentecostal]] view is that every Christian should expect to be [[Baptism in the holy spirit|baptized in the Holy Spirit]], the distinctive mark of which is glossolalia.<ref name=ag-truths>{{cite web |title=Statement of Fundamental Truths |url=http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/Statement_of_Fundamental_Truths/sft.pdf |author=[[Assemblies of God]] |publisher=[[General Council of the Assemblies of God of the United States]] |year=1961 |accessdate=9 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619112828/http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/Statement_of_Fundamental_Truths/sft.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> While most Protestants agree that baptism in the Holy Spirit is integral to being a Christian, others<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christians.eu/holy-spirit-baptism/|title=Baptism with the Holy Spirit|work=christians.eu}}</ref> believe that it is not separable from [[Religious conversion|conversion]] and no longer marked by glossolalia. Pentecostals appeal to the declaration of the [[Apostle Peter]] at Pentecost, that \"the gift of the Holy Spirit\" was \"for you and for your children and for all who are far off\" ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 2|Acts 2:38\u201339]]). Cessationists reply that the gift of speaking in tongues was never for all ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 12|1 Cor 12:30]]). In response to those who say that the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is not a separate experience from conversion, Pentecostals appeal to the question asked by the [[Apostle Paul]] to the Ephesian believers \"Have ye received the Holy Ghost ''since'' ye believed?\" ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 19|Acts 19:2]]).\n* '''One gift'''. Different aspects of speaking in tongues appear in Acts and 1 Corinthians, such that the [[Assemblies of God]] declare that the gift in Acts \"is the same in essence as the gift of tongues\" in 1 Corinthians \"but different in purpose and use\".<ref name=ag-truths/> They distinguish between (private) speech in tongues when receiving the gift of the Spirit, and (public) speech in tongues for the benefit of the church. Others assert that the gift in Acts was \"not a different phenomenon\" but the same gift being displayed under varying circumstances.<ref name=grudem1994p1073>{{Cite book|first=Wayne A. |last=Grudem |authorlink=Wayne Grudem |title=Systematic theology: an introduction to biblical doctrine |publisher=[[Inter-Varsity Press]] |location=[[Leicester]] |year=1994 |page=1073 |isbn=978-0-85110-652-6 |oclc=29952151}}</ref> The same description \u2013 \"speaking in tongues\" \u2013 is used in both Acts and 1 Corinthians, and in both cases the speech is in an unlearned language.\n* '''Direction'''. The New Testament describes tongues largely as speech addressed to God, but also as something that can potentially be interpreted into human language, thereby \"edifying the hearers\" ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 14|1 Cor 14:5,13]]). At Pentecost and Caesarea the speakers were praising God ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 2|Acts 2:11]]; [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 10|10:46]]).  Paul referred to praying, singing praise, and giving thanks in tongues ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 14|1 Cor 14:14\u201317]]), as well as to the [[interpretation of tongues]] ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 14|1 Cor 14:5]]), and instructed those speaking in tongues to pray for the ability to interpret their tongues so others could understand them ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 14|1 Cor 14:13]]). While some limit speaking in tongues to speech addressed to God \u2013 \"prayer or praise\",<ref name=grudem1994p1070/> others claim that speech in tongues is revelation from God to the church, and when interpreted into human language by those embued with the gift of interpretation of tongues for the benefit of others present, may be considered equivalent to prophecy.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Peter |last=Masters |author2=[[John C.

The holiness movement embraced the Wesleyan doctrine of \"sanctification\" or the second work of grace, subsequent to conversion.

Generally, however, it is agreed that speaking in tongues is a [[spiritual gift]] that can be manifested as either a human language or a heavenly supernatural language in three ways{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}:\n# The \"sign of tongues\" refers to [[xenoglossia]], wherein one speaks an actual language he has never learnt.\n# The \"gift of tongues\" refers to a glossolalic utterance spoken by an individual and addressed to a congregation of, typically, other believers.\n# Lastly, \"praying in the spirit\" is typically used to refer to glossolalia as part of personal prayer.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\nMany Pentecostals and charismatics adhere to Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 14 which established guidelines on the public use of glossolalia in the church at Corinth.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe gift of tongues is often referred to as a \"message in tongues\".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} This use of glossolalia requires an interpretation so that the gathered congregation can understand the message. This is accomplished by the [[interpretation of tongues]], another spiritual gift. There are two schools of thought concerning the nature of a message in tongues:\n# One school of thought believes it is always directed ''to'' God as prayer, praise, or thanksgiving but is spoken in for the hearing and edification of the congregation.\n# The other school of thought believes that a message in tongues can be a prophetic utterance inspired by the Holy Spirit.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In this case, the speaker delivers a message to the congregation on behalf of God.\n\nIn addition to praying in the Spirit, many Pentecostal and charismatic churches practice what is known as [[singing in the Spirit]]. The Apostle \"Paul's definition of spiritual songs \u2013 is singing in the Spirit which is singing in tongues (1 Corinthians 14:15).

The Slade is a department of [[University College London]], where Chesterton also took classes in literature, but did not complete a degree in either subject.\n\n==Family life==\n\nChesterton married [[Frances Blogg]] in 1901; the marriage lasted the rest of his life. Chesterton credited Frances with leading him back to [[Anglicanism]], though he later considered Anglicanism to be a \"pale imitation\". He entered full communion with the [[Catholic Church]] in 1922.<ref>{{Citation |date=March 2007 | publisher = Google | url = http://socrates58.blogspot.com/2007/03/gk-chestertons-conversion-story.html | contribution = GK Chesterton's Conversion Story | format = [[World Wide Web]] log | title = Socrates 58}}.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nIn September 1895 Chesterton began working for the London publisher [[George Redway|Redway]], where he remained for just over a year.{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=41}} In October 1896 he moved to the publishing house [[T.

In 1902 the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'' gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.\n\nEarly on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images.  Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. [[Father Brown]] is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story \"The Flying Stars\", Father Brown entreats the character [[Flambeau (character)|Flambeau]] to give up his life of crime: \"There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down.

He had a tendency to forget where he was supposed to be going and miss the train that was supposed to take him there.

Where ought I to be?\" to which she would reply, \"Home\".{{Sfn | Ward | 1944 | loc = chapter XV}}  (Chesterton himself tells the story, omitting, however, his wife's alleged reply, in ch.

However, from 1932 until his death, Chesterton delivered over 40 talks per year. He was allowed (and encouraged) to improvise on the scripts. This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts.{{sfn|Ker|2011}}\n\nThe talks were very popular.

He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, Catholic theologian<ref>Bridges, Horace J. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/ethicaladdresses21ameruoft#page/20/mode/2up \"G.

Chesterton a Theologian?,\" ''The Chesterton Review''. (Rep. by [http://catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0499.html ''CERC: Catholic Education Research Center''].)</ref> and [[apologist]], debater, and mystery writer. He was a columnist for the ''Daily News'', ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', and his own paper, ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]''; he also wrote articles for the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', including the entry on [[Charles Dickens]] and part of the entry on Humour in the 14th edition (1929). His best-known character is the priest-detective [[Father Brown]],<ref name=\"Father Brown on Chesterton,\"/> who appeared only in short stories, while ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on [[distributism]] were popularised through ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', published by [[Seward Collins]] in New York.\n\nOf his nonfiction, ''Charles Dickens: A Critical Study'' (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to [[Ian Ker]] (''The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845\u20131961'', 2003), \"In Chesterton's eyes Dickens belongs to [[Merry England|Merry]], not [[Puritan]], England\"; Ker treats Chesterton's thought in Chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time.\n\nChesterton's writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.<ref>Douglas, J. D. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-27-52.0.html \"G.K. Chesterton, the Eccentric Prince of Paradox,\"] ''Christianity Today'', 8 January 2001.</ref><ref>Gray, Robert.

Dickens' approach is one of these. Another is represented by [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]], whom Chesterton knew well: satirists and social commentators following in the tradition of [[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler]], vigorously wielding paradox as a weapon against complacent acceptance of the conventional view of things.\n\nChesterton's style and thinking were all his own, however, and his conclusions were often opposed to those of Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. In his book ''[[Heretics (book)|Heretics]]'', Chesterton has this to say of Wilde: \"The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde.  It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch7.html chapter 7]}}  More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in ''Orthodoxy'' concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: \"Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.\"\n\nChesterton and Shaw were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions.  Although rarely in agreement, they both maintained good will toward and respect for each other. However, in his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In ''Heretics'' he writes of Shaw:\n\n{{quote |After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch4.html chapter 4]}}}}\n\nShaw represented the new school of thought, [[modernism]], which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' he writes: \"The worship of will is the negation of will \u2026 If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch20.html chapter 20]}}\n\n[[File:Title Page of Orthodoxy, by G.K.

This is illustrated again in ''Orthodoxy'': \"Thus when Mr. H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), 'All chairs are quite different', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them 'all chairs'.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1908b | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html chapter 3]}} Or, again from ''Orthodoxy'':\n\n<blockquote>The wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless \u2013 one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is \u2013 well, some things are not hard to calculate.

Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed \"mentally defective\"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction.

He also points to several pieces by [[Henry Purcell]], one of which includes the opening notes of the modern tune, setting the words \"God Save the King\". Nineteenth-century scholars and commentators mention the widespread belief that an old Scots carol, \"Remember O Thou Man\" was the source of the tune.<ref>{{cite book| last=Sousa| first = John Philip| title=National, Patriotic, and Typical Airs of All Lands| year=1890| quote=[Remember O Thou Man] is the air on the ground of which ''God Save the King'' Is sometimes claimed for Scotland.

The 1744 version of the song was popularised in Scotland and England the following year, with the landing of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] and was published in ''The Gentleman's Magazine'' (see illustration above). This manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points, one as early as the first bar, but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem. It was recorded as being sung in London theatres in 1745, with, for example, [[Thomas Arne]] writing a setting of the tune for the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]].\n\nScholes' analysis includes mention of \"untenable\" and \"doubtful\" claims, as well as \"an American misattribution\".

Like many aspects of British constitutional life, its official status derives from custom and use, not from Royal [[Proclamation]] or [[Act of Parliament]]. In general, only one or two verses are sung, but on rare occasions, three.<ref name = \"royal.gov.uk\"/>  The variation in the UK of the lyrics to \"God Save the Queen\" is the oldest amongst those currently used, and forms the basis on which all other versions used throughout the Commonwealth are formed; though, again, the words have varied throughout these years.\n\nEngland has no official national anthem of its own; \"God Save the Queen\" is treated as the English national anthem when England is represented at sporting events (though there are some exceptions to this rule, such as cricket where \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\" is used). There is a movement to establish an English national anthem, with [[William Blake|Blake]] and [[Hubert Parry|Parry]]'s \"Jerusalem\" and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar's]] \"[[Land of Hope and Glory]]\" among the top contenders. Scotland has its own national song and Wales has its own national anthem for political and national events and for use at international [[Association football|football]], [[rugby union]] and other sports in which those nations compete independently.<ref name = \"olympic usage\"/> On all occasions Wales' national anthem is \"[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]\" (Land of my Fathers). Scotland has no single anthem; \"[[Scotland the Brave]]\" was traditionally used until the 1990s, when \"[[Flower of Scotland]]\" was adopted.

However, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites examples of \"[God] send (a person) safe, victorious, etc.\" meaning \"God grant that he may be safe, etc.\". There are also examples of early eighteenth century Jacobean drinking glasses which are inscribed with a version of the words and were apparently intended for drinking the health of [[James II of England|King James II and VII]].\n\nScholes acknowledges these possibilities but argues that the same words were probably being used by both Jacobite and Hanoverian supporters and directed at their respective kings.<ref name = \"mwtppa\">Scholes p.412</ref>\n\nIn 1902, the musician [[William Hayman Cummings]], quoting mid-18th century correspondence between [[Charles Burney]] and Sir Joseph Banks, proposed that the words were based on a Latin verse composed for King James II at the [[Chapel Royal]].{{quote|<poem>O Deus optime\nSalvum nunc facito\nRegem nostrum\nSic laeta victoria\nComes et gloria\nSalvum iam facito\nTu dominum.<ref>God Save the King, William H.

At the [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|Closing Ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics]], the fourth verse of the [[William Edward Hickson|William Hickson]] alternative lyrics was sung instead of the third verse.\n\n====Standard version of the music====\n[[File:God Save The Queen 2007 St Giles Fair.ogg|thumb|right|alt=Church choir sing at fair.

The bass line of the standard version differs little from the second voice part shown in the original, and there is a standard version in four-part harmony for choirs. The first three lines (six bars of music) are soft, ending with a short ''crescendo'' into \"Send her victorious\", and then is another ''crescendo'' at \"over us:\" into the final words \"God save the Queen\".\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century there existed a Military Band version in the higher key of B{{music|flat}},<ref>Official versions published by [[Kneller Hall|Kneller Hall Royal Military School of Music]]</ref> because it was easier for brass instruments to play in that key, though it had the disadvantage of being more difficult to sing: however now most Bands play it in the correct key of G.\n\nSince 1953, the anthem is sometimes preceded by a fanfare composed by [[Gordon Jacob]] for the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Richards|title=Imperialism And Music: Britain 1876-1953|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2002|page=120|isbn=0719045061}}</ref>\n\n====Alternative British versions====\nThere have been several attempts to improve the song by rewriting the words. In the nineteenth century there was some lively debate about the national anthem and, even then, verse two was considered to be slightly offensive. Notably, the question arose over the phrase \"scatter her enemies.\" Some thought it placed better emphasis on the respective power of Parliament and the Crown to change \"her\" to \"our\"; others pointed out that the theology was somewhat dubious and substituted \"thine\" instead. Sydney G. R. Coles wrote a completely new version, as did Canon F. K. Harford.<ref>Richards p.91</ref> In 1836, [[William Edward Hickson]] wrote four alternative verses. The first, third, and fourth of these verses are appended to the National Anthem in the [[English Hymnal]] (which only includes verses one and three of the original lyrics).\n\n=====William Hickson's alternative version=====\nWilliam Hickson's alternative (1836) version includes the following verses, of which the first, third, and fourth have some currency as they are appended to the National Anthem in the English Hymnal.

An Army Order was duly issued in 1933, which laid down regulations for tempo, dynamics and orchestration. This included instructions such as that the opening \"six bars will be played quietly by the reed band with horns and basses in a single phrase. Cornets and side-drum are to be added at the little scale-passage leading into the second half of the tune, and the full brass enters for the last eight bars\". The official tempo for the opening section is a metronome setting of 60, with the second part played in a broader manner, at a metronome setting of 52.<ref name=\"fn_2\">Percy A Scholes: ''Oxford Companion to Music, Tenth Edition'', Oxford University Press</ref> In recent years the prescribed sombre-paced introduction is often played at a faster and livelier [[tempo]].\n\nUntil the latter part of the 20th century, theatre and concert goers were expected to stand while the anthem was played after the conclusion of a show. In cinemas this brought a tendency for audiences to rush out while the end credits played to avoid this formality.  (This can be seen in the 1972 ''[[Dad's Army]]'' episode \"[[A Soldier's Farewell]]\".)\n\nThe anthem continues to be played at some traditional events such as [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], [[Royal Variety Performance]], the [[Edinburgh Tattoo]], [[Royal Ascot]], [[Henley Royal Regatta]] and [[The Proms]] as well as at Royal events.\n\nThe anthem was traditionally played at closedown on the [[BBC]], and with the introduction of commercial television to the UK this practice was adopted by some [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] companies (with the notable exception of [[Granada Television|Granada]]). [[BBC Two]] never played the anthem at closedown, and ITV dropped the practice in the late 1980s, but it continued on [[BBC One]] until the final closedown on 8 November 1997 (thereafter BBC One began to [[simulcast]] with [[BBC News]] after end of programmes). <!--The national anthem may be brought back for the [[digital television in the United Kingdom|analogue shutoff in 2012]].--> The tradition is carried on, however, by [[BBC Radio 4]], which plays the anthem each night as a transition piece between the end of the Radio 4 broadcasting and the move to [[BBC World Service]].<ref name=\"Guardian on Radio 4\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2010/mar/17/radio-4-national-anthem |title=Radio 4 keeps flying the flag|  publisher=The Guardian|  date=17 March 2010|  accessdate=9 March 2013|  location=London}}</ref> Radio 4 and [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] also play the National Anthem just before the 0700 and 0800 news bulletins on the actual and [[Queen's Official Birthday|official]] birthdays of the Queen and the birthdays of senior members of the [[Royal Family]].\n\nThe UK's national anthem usually prefaces [[Royal Christmas Message|The Queen's Christmas Message]] (although in 2007 it appeared at the end, taken from a recording of the 1957 television broadcast), and important royal announcements, such as of royal deaths, when it is played in a slower, sombre arrangement.\n\n===Other British anthems===\nFrequently, when an anthem is needed for one of the constituent [[countries of the United Kingdom]]{{spaced ndash}} at an international sporting event, for instance{{spaced ndash}} an alternative song is used:\n<!--\n\nNOTE ON GRAMMAR:\nStandard British English usage is to refer to sports teams in the plural form, unlike in American English (as in \"Manchester United are sitting at the top of the Premier League\" not \"Manchester United is...\").

In addition, several [[States of the German Empire|German states]] used the tune, including [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] (''Heil unserm K\u00f6nig, Heil! - Hail to our King, Hail!''), [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] (''Gott segne Sachsenland - God bless Saxony'') and Liechtenstein, which did not join the German Empire (see below). During the reign of [[Otto of Greece]], the Bavarian royal anthem also served as the Greek anthem.\n* The state anthem of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], ''[[Heil dir, Hannover]]'', used the melody of \"God Save the King\". Hanover was in [[personal union]] with the Kingdom of Great Britain and subsequently the United Kingdom from 1714 to 1837.\n* The national anthem of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] from 1816 to 1833 was ''[[Molitva russkikh]]'' (\"The Prayer of Russians\"), which used the melody of \"God Save the King\" and lyrics by [[Vasily Zhukovsky]].<ref>[http://www.hymn.ru/index-en.html \"Russian Anthems museum\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20101002054755/http://www.hymn.ru//index-en.html |date=2 October 2010 }}</ref>\n* In Switzerland (''[[Rufst Du, mein Vaterland]]'' or ''\u00d4 monts ind\u00e9pendants'', until 1961).\n* \"God Save the King\" was used as the national anthem of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] before 1860\n* [[E Ola Ke Alii Ke Akua]], from 1860 to 1886 the national anthem of Hawaii, was set to the same melody.\n* The Hawaiian anthem [[Hawai\u02bbi Pono\u02bb\u012b]] composed by the Prussian [[Kapellmeister]] [[Henri Berger]] is a variation of the melody.<ref>''The melody was based on the Prussian hymn originally titled \"Heil Dir Im Siegerkranz\".'' {{cite web | title=Hawai\u02bbi pono\u02bb\u012b | url=http://www.huapala.org/Hawaii/Hawaii_Ponoi.html | accessdate=2018-06-02 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117070257/http://www.huapala.org/Hawaii/Hawaii_Ponoi.html | archivedate=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n* The royal and national anthem of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] ''\"[[Thai National Anthem|Chomrat Chongcharoen]]\"''  used the melody of \"God Save the King\" from 1852 to 1871 in the reign of [[Rama IV]] and [[Rama V]] before adoption of \"[[Sansoen Phra Barami]]\" in 1888\n* The American patriotic [[hymn]] \"[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]\", the lyrics of which were written by [[Samuel Francis Smith]] in 1831.

In consequence, the tune was played twice before a [[2004 European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] qualifying match between [[England national football team|England]] and [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]]; and again before the [[Euro 96]] qualifier between [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and Liechtenstein.

Clementi paid a high tribute to his adopted homeland (the United Kingdom) where he grew up and stayed most of his lifetime.

It became the anthem of the [[Austrian Empire]] after the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with revised lyrics, its tune ultimately being used for the [[German national anthem]]. The tune of \"God Save the King\" was adopted for the Prussian royal anthem \"[[Heil Dir im Siegerkranz]]\".\n\n[[Franz Liszt]] wrote a piano paraphrase on the anthem (S.259 in the official catalogue, c. 1841).\n\n[[Johann Strauss I]] quoted \"God Save the Queen\" in full at the end of his [[waltz]] ''Huldigung der K\u00f6nigin Victoria von Grossbritannien'' (Homage to Queen Victoria of Great Britain) Op. 103, where he also quoted ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]'' in full at the beginning of the piece.\n\n[[Siegfried August Mahlmann]] in the early 19th century wrote alternate lyrics to adapt the hymn for the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], as \"Gott segne Sachsenland\" (\"God Bless Saxony\").<ref>{{cite book| author=Granville Bantock| title=Sixty Patriotic Songs of All Nations| publisher=Ditson| year=1913| page=xv| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMgQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP25}}</ref>\n\n[[Heinrich Marschner]] used the anthem in his \"Grande Ouverture solenne\", op.78 (1842).\n\n[[Gaetano Donizetti]] used this anthem in his opera \"[[Roberto Devereux]]\".\n\n[[Joachim Raff]] used this anthem in his Jubelouverture, Opus 103 (1864) dedicated to Adolf, Herzog von Nassau, on the 25th anniversary of his reign.\n\n[[Gioachino Rossini]] used this anthem in the last scene of his \"[[Il viaggio a Reims]]\", when all the characters, coming from many different European countries, sing a song which recalls their own homeland. Lord Sidney, bass, sings \"Della real pianta\" on the notes of \"God Save the King\". [[Samuel Ramey]] used to interpolate a spectacular virtuoso [[cadenza]] at the end of the song.\n\n[[Fernando Sor]] used the anthem in his 12 Studies, Op. 6: No. 10 in C Major in the section marked 'Maestoso.'\n\n[[Arthur Sullivan]] quotes the anthem at the end of his ballet ''[[Victoria and Merrie England]]''.\n\n[[Claude Debussy]] opens with a brief introduction of \"God Save the King\" in one of his [[Preludes (Debussy)|Preludes]], ''[[Hommage \u00e0 S.

Novello seized upon the prevailing patriotism and requested that Elgar arrange the National Anthem as an appropriate opening for a concert performed in front of the Court and numerous British and foreign dignitaries. This version for orchestra and chorus, which is enlivened by use of ''a cappella'' and marcato effects, was also performed at the opening of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on St. George\u2019s Day, 1924, and recorded under the composer's Baton in 1928, with the LSO and the Philharmonic Choir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elgar.org/3transcr.htm| title=His Music : Orchestral Arrangements and Transcriptions| publisher=Elgar| accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref> Elgar also used the first verse of the Anthem as the climax of a short \"Civic Procession and Anthem\", written to accompany the mayoral procession at the opening of the Hereford Music Festival on 4 September 1927.

It included a polytonal section in three simultaneous keys, though this was omitted from performances at his father's request, because \"it made the boys laugh out loud\". Ives was fond of the rapid pedal line in the final variation, which he said was \"almost as much fun as playing baseball\". The piece was not published until 1949; the final version includes an introduction, seven variations and a polytonal interlude. The piece was adapted for orchestra in 1963 by [[William Schuman]].

Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.\n\nIrrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world.\n\nThe origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the [[Punic Wars]] of the 3rd century BC, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly [[Ludi|games]].\n\nThe gladiator games lasted for nearly a thousand years, reaching their peak between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD.  The games finally declined during the early 5th century after the adoption of [[Christianity]] as [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, although beast hunts (''[[venatio]]nes'') continued into the 6th century.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Fronton marmol anfiteatro romano de Merida.JPG|thumb|Relief of gladiators from [[Amphitheatre of M\u00e9rida]], Spain]]\nEarly literary sources seldom agree on the origins of gladiators and the gladiator games.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=82}}.</ref> In the late 1st century BC, [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] believed they were [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=16\u201317}}.

Paestum was colonized by Rome in 273 BC.</ref> Compared to these images, supporting evidence from Etruscan tomb-paintings is tentative and late. The Paestum frescoes may represent the continuation of a much older tradition, acquired or inherited from Greek colonists of the 8th century BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=15, 18}}.</ref>\n\nLivy places the first Roman gladiator games (264 BC) in the early stage of Rome's [[First Punic War]] against [[Carthage]], when Decimus Iunius Brutus Scaeva had three gladiator pairs fight to the death in Rome's \"cattle market\" Forum (''[[Forum Boarium]]'') to honor his dead father, Brutus Pera. This is described as a ''[[wiktionary:munus#Latin|munus]]'' (plural: ''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]''), a commemorative duty owed the [[manes]] of a dead ancestor by his descendants.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=18\u201319}}. Livy's account (summary 16) places beast-hunts and gladiatorial ''munera'' within this single ''[[wikt:munus|munus]]''.</ref><ref>A single, later source describes the gladiator type involved as [[Thraex|Thracian]]. See {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=19}}. Welch is citing Ausanius: Seneca simply says they were \"war captives\".</ref> The development of the ''munus'' and its [[List of Roman gladiator types|gladiator types]] was most strongly influenced by Samnium's support for [[Hannibal]] and the subsequent punitive expeditions against the Samnites by Rome and her Campanian allies; the earliest and most frequently mentioned type was the [[Samnite (gladiator type)|Samnite]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=273}}. Evidence of \"Samnite\" as an insult in earlier writings fades as Samnium is absorbed into the Republic.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe war in Samnium, immediately afterwards, was attended with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion. The enemy, besides their other warlike preparation, had made their battle-line to glitter with new and splendid arms. There were two corps: the shields of the one were inlaid with gold, of the other with silver&nbsp;... The Romans had already heard of these splendid accoutrements, but their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough to look on, not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and in courage&nbsp;... The [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], as decreed by the [[Roman senate|senate]], celebrated a triumph, in which by far the finest show was afforded by the captured armour. So the Romans made use of the splendid armour of their enemies to do honour to their gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the name Samnites. (Livy 9.40)<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4\u20135}}.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLivy's account skirts the funereal, sacrificial function of early Roman gladiator combats and reflects the later theatrical ethos of the Roman gladiator show: splendidly, exotically armed and armoured [[barbarians]], treacherous and degenerate, are dominated by Roman iron and native courage.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=67 (Note #84)}}. Livy's published works are often embellished with illustrative rhetorical detail.</ref> His plain Romans virtuously dedicate the magnificent spoils of war to the Gods. Their Campanian allies stage a dinner entertainment using gladiators who may not be Samnites, but play the Samnite role. Other groups and tribes would join the cast list as Roman territories expanded. Most gladiators were armed and armoured in the manner of the enemies of Rome.<ref>The ''velutes'' and later, the ''provocatores'' were exceptions, but as \"historicised\" rather than contemporary Roman types. See [[List of Roman gladiator types|Gladiator types]].</ref> The ''munus'' became a morally instructive form of historic enactment in which the only honourable option for the gladiator was to fight well, or else die well.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=80\u201381}}.</ref>\n\n===Development===\nIn 216 BC, [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 232 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], late [[Roman consul|consul]] and [[augur]], was honoured by his sons with three days of ''gladiatora munera'' in the [[Forum Romanum]], using twenty-two pairs of gladiators.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}. Welch is citing Livy, 23.30.15. The Aemilii Lepidii were one of the most important families in Rome at the time, and probably owned a gladiator school (''ludus'').</ref> Ten years later, [[Scipio Africanus]] gave a commemorative ''munus'' in Iberia for his father and uncle, casualties in the Punic Wars. High status non-Romans, and possibly Romans too, volunteered as his gladiators.<ref name=\"Futrell, 8-9\">{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref> The context of the [[Punic Wars]] and Rome's near-disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216 BC) link these early games to munificence, the celebration of military victory and the religious expiation of military disaster; these ''munera'' appear to serve a morale-raising agenda in an era of military threat and expansion.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=30}}.</ref> The next recorded ''munus'', held for the funeral of [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 205 BC)|Publius Licinius]] in 183 BC, was more extravagant. It involved three days of funeral games, 120 gladiators, and public distribution of meat (''visceratio data'')<ref>Livy, 39.46.2.</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 a practice that reflected the gladiatorial fights at Campanian banquets described by Livy and later deplored by Silius Italicus.<ref>Silius Italicus quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4\u20135}}.</ref>\n\nThe enthusiastic adoption of ''gladiatoria munera'' by Rome's Iberian allies shows how easily, and how early, the culture of the gladiator ''munus'' permeated places far from Rome itself. By 174 BC, \"small\" Roman ''munera'' (private or public), provided by an ''[[wiktionary:editor#Latin|editor]]'' of relatively low importance, may have been so commonplace and unremarkable they were not considered worth recording:<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nMany gladiatorial games were given in that year, some unimportant, one noteworthy beyond the rest&nbsp;\u2014 that of [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus|Titus Flamininus]] which he gave to commemorate the death of his father, which lasted four days, and was accompanied by a public distribution of meats, a banquet, and scenic performances. The climax of the show which was big for the time was that in three days seventy four gladiators fought.<ref>Livy, ''Annal for the Year 174 BC'' (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 105 BC, the ruling consuls offered Rome its first taste of state-sponsored \"[[barbarian]] combat\" demonstrated by gladiators from Capua, as part of a training program for the military. It proved immensely popular.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=6\u20137}}. Wiedemann is citing Valerius Maximus, 2.3.2.</ref> Thereafter, the gladiator contests formerly restricted to private ''munera'' were often included in the state games (''[[ludi]]'')<ref>The games were always referred to in the plural, as ''ludi''. Gladiator schools were also known as ''ludi'' when plural; a single school was ''ludus''</ref> that accompanied the major religious festivals. Where traditional ''ludi'' had been dedicated to a deity, such as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the ''munera'' could be dedicated to an aristocratic sponsor's divine or heroic ancestor.<ref name=\"Lintott 2004 183\">{{harvnb|Lintott|2004|p=183}}.</ref>\n\n===Peak===\n[[File:Retiarius stabs secutor (color).jpg|thumb|A ''[[retiarius]]'' stabs at a ''[[secutor]]'' with his [[trident]] in this mosaic from the villa at [[Nennig]], Germany, c. 2nd\u20133rd century AD.]]\nGladiator games offered their sponsors extravagantly expensive but effective opportunities for self-promotion, and gave their clients and potential voters exciting entertainment at little or no cost to themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Coleman|1990|p=50}}.</ref> Gladiators became big business for trainers and owners, for politicians on the make and those who had reached the top and wished to stay there.

The Samnite, heavily armed, elegantly helmed and probably the most popular type, was renamed [[secutor]]  and the Gaul renamed [[murmillo]], once these former enemies had been conquered then absorbed into Rome's Empire. In the mid-republican ''munus'', each type seems to have fought against a similar or identical type. In the later Republic and early Empire, various \"fantasy\" types were introduced, and were set against dissimilar but complementary types. For example, the bareheaded, nimble [[retiarius]] (\"net-man\"), armoured only at the left arm and shoulder, pitted his net, trident and dagger against the more heavily armoured, helmeted Secutor.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=313}}</ref> Most depictions of gladiators show the most common and popular types. Passing literary references to others has allowed their tentative reconstruction. Other novelties introduced around this time included gladiators who fought from [[Essedarius|chariots or carts]], or from [[Eques (ancient Rome)|horseback]].\n\nThe trade in gladiators was empire-wide, and subjected to official supervision. Rome's military success produced a supply of soldier-prisoners who were redistributed for use in State mines or amphitheatres and for sale on the open market. For example, in the aftermath of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Jewish Revolt]], the gladiator schools received an influx of Jews&nbsp;\u2013 those rejected for training would have been sent straight to the arenas as ''noxii'' (lit.

''Epistles'', 30.8)</blockquote>\n\nSome mosaics show defeated gladiators kneeling in preparation for the moment of death.

The Christian author [[Tertullian]], commenting on ''ludi meridiani'' in Roman [[Carthage]] during the peak era of the games, describes a more humiliating method of removal. One arena official, dressed as the \"brother of Jove\", [[Dis Pater]] (god of the underworld) strikes the corpse with a mallet. Another, dressed as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], tests for life-signs with a heated \"wand\"; once confirmed as dead, the body is dragged from the arena.<ref>By Tertullian's time, Mercury was identified with Greek [[Hermes#Epithets of Hermes|Hermes psychopompos]], who led souls into the underworld.  Tertullian describes these events as examples of hollow impiety, in which Rome's false deities are acceptably impersonated by low and murderous persons for the purposes of human sacrifice and evil entertainment. See {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=155\u2013168}}.</ref>\n\nWhether these victims were gladiators or ''noxii'' is unknown. Modern pathological examination confirms the probably fatal use of a mallet on some, but not all the gladiator skulls found in a gladiators' cemetery.<ref>{{harvnb|Grossschmidt|Kanz|2006|pp=207\u2013216}}.</ref> Kyle (1998) proposes that gladiators who disgraced themselves might have been subjected to the same indignities as ''noxii'', denied the relative mercies of a quick death and dragged from the arena as carrion. Whether the corpse of such a gladiator could be redeemed from further ignominy by friends or ''familia'' is not known.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=40, 155\u2013168}}.

Kyle contextualises Juvenal's ''panem et circenses''&nbsp;\u2013 bread and games as a sop to the politically apathetic plebs (Satires, 4.10) &nbsp;\u2013 within an account of the death and ''damnatio'' of [[Sejanus]], whose body was torn to pieces by the crowd and left unburied.</ref> Denial of funeral rites and memorial condemned the shade (''manes'') of the deceased to restless wandering upon the earth as a dreadful ''[[lemures|larva'' or ''lemur]]''.<ref>Suetonius. ''Lives'', \"Tiberius\", 75. Suetonius has the populace wish the same fate on [[Tiberius]]'s body, a form of ''damnatio'': to be thrown in the Tiber, or left unburied, or \"dragged with the hook\".</ref> Ordinary citizens, slaves and freedmen were usually buried beyond the town or city limits, to avoid the ritual and physical pollution of the living; professional gladiators had their own, separate cemeteries.

Otherwise, the gladiator's ''familia'', which included his ''lanista'', comrades and blood-kin, might fund his funeral and memorial costs, and use the memorial to assert their moral reputation as responsible, respectful colleagues or family members. Some monuments record the gladiator's career in some detail, including the number of appearances, victories\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200asometimes represented by an engraved crown or wreath\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200adefeats, career duration, and age at death.

Modern scholarship offers little support for the once-prevalent notion that gladiators, ''venatores'' and ''bestiarii'' were personally or professionally dedicated to the cult of the Graeco-Roman goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]. Rather, she seems to have represented a kind of \"Imperial [[Fortuna]]\" who dispensed Imperial retribution on the one hand, and Imperially subsidised gifts on the other \u2013 including the ''munera''. One gladiator's tomb dedication clearly states that her decisions are not to be trusted.<ref>Nemesis, her devotees and her place in the Roman world are fully discussed, with examples, in Hornum, Michael B., ''Nemesis, the Roman state and the games'', Brill, 1993.</ref> Many gladiator epitaphs claim Nemesis, fate, deception or treachery as the instrument of their death, never the superior skills of the flesh-and-blood adversary who defeated and killed them.

Few gladiators survived more than 10 contests, though one survived an extraordinary 150 bouts;<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=145}}</ref> and another died at 90 years of age, presumably long after retirement.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=144}}</ref> A natural death following retirement is also likely for three individuals who died at 38, 45, and 48 years respectively.<ref name=\"FIGHTING FOR IDENTITY 2000\"/> George Ville, using evidence from 1st century gladiator headstones, calculated an average age at death of 27, and mortality \"among all who entered the arena\" at 19/100.<ref name=\"Futrell 2006 144\">{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=144}}.

In the late Republican era, a fear of similar uprisings, the usefulness of gladiator schools in creating private armies, and the exploitation of ''munera'' for political gain led to increased restrictions on gladiator school ownership, siting and organisation. By [[Domitian]]'s time, many had been more or less absorbed by the State, including those at [[Pergamum]], [[Alexandria]], [[Praeneste]] and Capua.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=285\u2013287, 312}}.

Their contract (''auctoramentum'') stipulated how often they were to perform, their fighting style and earnings. A condemned bankrupt or debtor accepted as novice (''novicius'') could negotiate with his  ''lanista'' or ''editor'' for the partial or complete payment of his debt.

Facial ''stigmata'' represented extreme social degradation.</ref>\n\nGladiators were typically accommodated in cells, arranged in barrack formation around a central practice arena.

But nobody obeying these orders of his, he gathered together a body of labourers, who worked for him, and overthrew all the scaffolds the very night before the contest was to take place. So that by the next morning the market-place was cleared, and the common people had an opportunity of seeing the pastime.

Their seating tiers surrounded the arena below, where the community's judgments were meted out, in full public view. From across the stands, crowd and ''editor'' could assess each other's character and temperament. For the crowd, amphitheatres afforded unique opportunities for free expression and free speech (''theatralis licentia''). Petitions could be submitted to the ''editor'' (as magistrate) in full view of the community. ''Factiones'' and claques could vent their spleen on each other, and occasionally on Emperors. The emperor Titus's dignified yet confident ease in his management of an amphitheatre crowd and its factions were taken as a measure of his enormous popularity and the rightness of his imperium. The amphitheatre ''munus'' thus served the Roman community as living theatre and a court in miniature, in which judgement could be served not only on those in the arena below, but on their judges.<ref>{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, \"Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics\", pp. 184\u2013185}}.

He separated the soldiery from the people. He assigned special seats to the married men of the commons, to boys under age their own section and the adjoining one to their preceptors; and he decreed that no one wearing a dark cloak should sit in the middle of the house.

From the early days of the Republic, ten years of military service were a citizen's duty and a prerequisite for election to public office. ''[[Devotio]]'' (willingness to sacrifice one\u2019s life to the greater good) was central to the Roman military ideal, and was the core of the Roman military oath. It applied from highest to lowest alike in the chain of command.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=81}}. It was notably fulfilled and celebrated in the battlefield ''devotio'' of two consular [[:Category:Decii|Decii]]; firstly by [[Publius Decius Mus (340 BC)|the father]] and later by his [[Publius Decius Mus (312 BC)|son]].</ref> As a soldier committed his life (voluntarily, at least in theory) to the greater cause of Rome's victory, he was not expected to survive defeat.<ref>{{harvnb|Edwards|2007|pp=19\u201345}}; Livy, 22.51.5\u20138, has wounded Romans at Cannae stretch out their necks for the death blow by comrades: ''cf'' Cicero's death in Seneca's ''Suasoriae'', 6.17.</ref>\n\nThe Punic Wars of the late 3rd century BC&nbsp;\u2013 in particular the near-catastrophic defeat of Roman arms at Cannae&nbsp;\u2013 had long-lasting effects on the Republic, its citizen armies, and the development of the gladiatorial ''munera''.

They were lowered into a stone vault, which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings. When the gods were believed to be duly propitiated&nbsp;... Armour, weapons, and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness, and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades. The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment; 8,000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no. These soldiers were preferred, as there would be an opportunity of ransoming them when taken prisoners at a lower price.<ref>Livy, 22.55\u201357.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Kourion10.jpg|thumb|190px|Late 3rd century gladiator mosaic from a private residence in [[Kourion]], [[Cyprus]].

While the Senate mustered their willing slaves, Hannibal offered his dishonoured Roman captives a chance for honourable death, in what Livy describes as something very like the Roman ''munus''. The ''munus'' thus represented an essentially military, self-sacrificial ideal, taken to extreme fulfillment in the gladiator's oath.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />  By the ''devotio'' of a voluntary oath, a slave might achieve the quality of a Roman (''Romanitas''), become the embodiment of true ''virtus'' (manliness, or manly virtue), and paradoxically, be granted ''missio'' while remaining a slave.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The gladiator as a specialist fighter, and the ethos and organization of the gladiator schools, would inform the development of the Roman military as the most effective force of its time.<ref>{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=274}}.</ref> In 107 BC, the [[Gaius Marius|Marian]] Reforms established the Roman army as a professional body. Two years later, following its defeat at Arausio:\n\n<blockquote>\n...weapons training was given to soldiers by P. Rutilius, consul with C. Mallis. For he, following the example of no previous general, with teachers summoned from the gladiatorial training school of C. Aurelus Scaurus, implanted in the legions a more sophisticated method of avoiding and dealing a blow and mixed bravery with skill and skill back again with virtue so that skill became stronger by bravery's passion and passion became more wary with the knowledge of this art.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe military were great aficionados of the games, and supervised the schools. Many schools and amphitheatres were sited at or near military barracks, and some provincial army units owned gladiator troupes.<ref>{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=45}}.</ref> As the Republic wore on, the term of military service increased from ten to the sixteen years formalised by Augustus in the Principate. It would rise to twenty, and later, to twenty five years. Roman military discipline was ferocious; severe enough to provoke mutiny, despite the consequences.

Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Letters to Friends'', 2.3.</ref> Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero's contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: \"Even when [gladiators] have been felled, let alone when they are standing and fighting, they never disgrace themselves.

For ''bustuarius'', with reference to Clodius's alleged impious disturbance at the funeral of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], see Cicero's ''In Pisonem'' (Against Piso). See {{harvnb|Bagnani|1956|p=26}}, for the bustuarius as a lower class of gladiator than one employed in the public ''munus''. Cicero's unflattering references to Marcus Antonius as ''gladiator'' are in his 2nd Philippic.</ref> [[Silius Italicus]] wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate [[Campania#Ancient tribes and Samnite Wars|Campanians]] had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: \"It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men [(Samnites)] fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood.

Having \"neither hope nor illusions\", the gladiator could transcend his own debased nature, and disempower death itself by meeting it face to face. Courage, dignity, altruism and loyalty were morally redemptive; [[Lucian]] idealised this principle in his story of Sisinnes, who voluntarily fought as a gladiator, earned 10,000 drachmas and used it to buy freedom for his friend, Toxaris.<ref>{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=154}}.

[[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] (r. 395\u2013423) legally ended ''munera'' in 399, and again in 404, at least in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. According to [[Theodoret]], the ban was in consequence of [[Saint Telemachus]]' martyrdom by spectators at a ''munus.''<ref>Telemachus had personally stepped in to prevent the munus. See Theoderet's ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', 5.26.</ref> [[Valentinian III]] (r. 425\u2013455) repeated the ban in 438, perhaps effectively, though ''venationes'' continued beyond 536.<ref>''Codex Justinianus'', 3.12.9.</ref> By this time, interest in ''munera'' had waned throughout the Roman world. In the Eastern Empire, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatrical shows]] and [[chariot race]]s continued to attract the crowds, and drew a generous Imperial subsidy.\n \nIt is not known how many ''gladiatoria munera'' were given throughout the Roman period. Many, if not most, involved ''venationes'', and in the later Empire some may have been only that. In 165 BC, at least one ''munus'' was held during April's [[Megalesia]]. In the early Imperial era, ''munera'' in Pompeii and neighbouring towns were dispersed from March through November. They included a provincial magnate's five-day ''munus'' of thirty pairs, plus beast-hunts.<ref>Alison E. Cooley and MGL Cooley, ''Pompeii, A Sourcebook'', Routledge, 2004, p. 218.</ref> A single late primary source, the ''Calendar of Furius Dionysius Philocalus'' for 354, shows how seldom gladiators featured among a multitude of official festivals. Of 176 days reserved for spectacles of various kinds, 102 were for theatrical shows, 64 for [[chariot race]]s and just 10 in December for gladiator games and ''venationes''. A century before this, the emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (r. 222\u2013235) may have intended a more even redistribution of ''munera'' throughout the year; but this would have broken with what had become the traditional positioning of the major gladiator games, at the year's ending. As Wiedemann points out, December was also the month for the [[Saturnalia]], [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn's]] festival, in which death was linked to renewal, and the lowest were honoured as the highest.<ref>{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=11\u201312}}.</ref>\n\n==Modern reconstructions==\n{{further|Roman-era historical reenactment|Combat reenactment|Historical European martial arts#Antiquity}}\nSome Roman reenactors attempt to recreate Roman gladiator troupes.  Some of these groups are part of larger Roman reenactment groups, and others are wholly independent, though they might participate in larger demonstrations of Roman reenacting or historical reenacting in general.

The pepla attempted to emulate the big-budget Hollywood historical epics of the time, such as ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''. Inspired by the success of ''Spartacus'', there were a number of Italian peplums that emphasized the gladiatorial arena fights in their plots, with it becoming almost a peplum subgenre in itself;  One group of supermen known as \"The Ten Gladiators\" appeared in a trilogy, all three films starring [[Dan Vadis]] in the lead role.\n\n* ''[[Fabiola (1949 film)|Fabiola]]'' (1948) a.k.a.

One research focus is to modify ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', bacteria that naturally provide some protection against [[HIV]], with genes that will further enhance this protection. If the bacteria do not form [[Bacterial colony|colonies]] inside the patient, the person must repeatedly ingest the modified bacteria in order to get the required doses. Enabling the bacteria to form a colony could provide a more long-term solution, but could also raise safety concerns as interactions between bacteria and the human body are less well understood than with traditional drugs.

Crops have been [[Inoculation|inoculated]] with [[Rhizobia]] (and more recently ''[[Azospirillum]]'') to increase their production or to allow them to be grown outside their original [[habitat]]. Application of ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) and other bacteria can help protect crops from insect infestation and plant diseases. With advances in genetic engineering, these bacteria have been manipulated for increased efficiency and expanded host range. Markers have also been added to aid in tracing the spread of the bacteria. The bacteria that naturally colonise certain crops have also been modified, in some cases to express the Bt genes responsible for pest resistance. ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' strains of bacteria cause frost damage by [[Nucleation|nucleating]] water into [[ice crystals]] around themselves. This led to the development of [[ice-minus bacteria]], that have the ice-forming genes removed.

Many trees face the threat of invasive plants and diseases, such as the [[emerald ash borer]] in North American and the fungal disease, [[Ceratocystis platani]], in European [[Platanus|plane trees]]. A suggested solution to increase the resilience of threatened tree species is to genetically modify individuals by transferring resistant genes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Jonathan M.|last2=Piovesan|first2=Gianluca|last3=Strauss|first3=Steve|last4=Brown|first4=Sandra|date=2002-08-01|title=The Case for Genetic Engineering of Native and Landscape Trees against Introduced Pests and Diseases|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=874\u201379|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00523.x|issn=1523-1739}}</ref> [[Papaya]] trees are an example of a species that was successfully conserved using genetic modification.

A main concern with using genetic modification for conservation purposes is that a transgenic species may no longer bear enough resemblance to the original species to truly claim that the original species is being conserved. Instead, the transgenic species may be genetically different enough to be considered a new species, thus diminishing the conservation worth of genetic modification.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Mammals===\n{{anchor|Transgenic animals}}\n{{Main|Genetically modified mammals}}\n[[File:ChimericMouseWithPups.jpg|thumb|Some [[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]], like the blotched mouse shown, are created through genetic modification techniques like [[gene targeting]].]]\n\nGenetically modified mammals are an important category of genetically modified organisms.<ref name=\"EFSA\">EFSA (2012).

The city grew from several nuclei, the abbeys and a commercial centre. Around 800, [[Louis the Pious]], son of [[Charlemagne]], appointed [[Einhard]], the biographer of Charlemagne, as abbot of both abbeys. In 851 and 879, the city was however attacked and plundered twice by the [[Viking]]s.\n[[File:Engelbert Van Siclers - De Kouter in Ghent in 1763.jpg|277px|thumb|''De Kouter in Ghent in 1763'' by [[Engelbert van Siclers]]]]\n\nWithin the protection of the [[County of Flanders]], the city recovered and flourished from the 11th century, growing to become a small [[city-state]]. By the 13th century, Ghent was the biggest city in Europe north of the Alps after [[Paris]]; it was bigger than [[Cologne]] or [[Moscow]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicholas|first=David|title=The Domestic Life of a Medieval City: Women, Children and the Family in Fourteenth Century Ghent|pages=1}}</ref> Within the city walls lived up to 65,000 people. The [[Belfry of Ghent|belfry]] and the towers of the [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] and [[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Saint Nicholas' Church]] are just a few examples of the skyline of the period.\n\nThe rivers flowed in an area where much land was periodically flooded. These rich grass 'meersen' (\"[[water-meadows]]\": a word related to the English '[[marsh]]') were ideally suited for herding sheep, the wool of which was used for making cloth. During the Middle Ages Ghent was the leading city for [[cloth]].\n\nThe [[Wool#History|wool industry]], originally established at [[Bruges]], created the first European industrialized zone in Ghent in the High [[Middle Ages]]. The mercantile zone was so highly developed that wool had to be imported from [[Scotland]] and England. This was one of the reasons for Flanders' good relationship with [[Scotland#Medieval period|Scotland]] and [[History of England#England under the Plantagenets|England]]. Ghent was the birthplace of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], Duke of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]]. Trade with England (but not Scotland) suffered significantly during the [[Hundred Years' War]].\n\n===Early modern period===\nThe city recovered in the 15th century, when Flanders was united with neighbouring provinces under the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]]. High taxes [[Revolt of Ghent (1449\u20131453)|led to a rebellion]] and eventually the [[Battle of Gavere]] in 1453, in which Ghent suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of [[Philip the Good]]. Around this time the centre of political and social importance in the Low Countries started to shift from Flanders (Bruges\u2013Ghent) to [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] ([[Antwerp]]\u2013[[Brussels]]), although Ghent continued to play an important role. With Bruges, the city led two [[Flemish revolts against Maximilian of Austria|revolts against Maximilian of Austria]], the first monarch of the [[House of Habsburg]] to rule [[Flanders]].\n[[File:Ghent hist centrum 2.jpg|left|thumb|Buildings along the [[Leie]] river in the city of Ghent]]\n[[File:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Justitiepaleis, Ghent, Belgium, ca. 1895.jpg|left|thumb|The Justitiepaleis in Ghent, c. 1895]]\n\nIn 1500, [[Juana of Castile]] gave birth to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who became [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]. Although native to Ghent, he punished the city after the 1539 [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|Revolt of Ghent]] and obliged the city's nobles to walk in front of the Emperor barefoot with a noose (Dutch: ''\"strop\"'') around the neck; since this incident, the people of Ghent have been called \"''Stroppendragers''\" (noose bearers). Saint Bavo Abbey (not to be confused with the nearby Saint Bavo Cathedral) was abolished, torn down, and replaced with a fortress for [[Kingdom of Spain|Royal Spanish]] troops. Only a small portion of the abbey was spared demolition.\n\nThe late 16th and the 17th centuries brought devastation because of the [[Eighty Years' War]]. The war ended the role of Ghent as a centre of international importance. In 1745, the city [[Fall of Ghent|was captured]] by French forces during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] before being returned to the [[Austria|Empire of Austria]]<nowiki/> under the [[Habsburgs|House of Habsburg]] following the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748, when this part of [[Flanders]] became known as the [[Austrian Netherlands]] until 1815, the exile of the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]], the end of the French Revolutionary and later [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the peace treaties arrived at by the [[Congress of Vienna]].\n\n===19th century===\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the textile industry flourished again in Ghent. [[Lieven Bauwens]], having smuggled the [[industrial revolution|industrial]] and factory machine plans out of [[England]], introduced the first mechanical [[Weaving machines|weaving machine]] on the [[European continent]] in 1800.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Ghent]], negotiated here and adopted on Christmas Eve 1814, formally ended the [[War of 1812]] between [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]] (the North American phase of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]). After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], Ghent and [[Flanders]], previously ruled from the [[Habsburgs|House of Habsburg]] in [[Vienna]] as the [[Austrian Netherlands]], became a part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] with the northern Dutch for 15 years. In this period, Ghent established its own [[Ghent University|university]] (1816)<ref name=\"visit.gent.be\">[https://visit.gent.be/en/good-know/practical-information/why-ghent/ghent-over-centuries Ghent over the centuries: Concise history of a stubborn city]</ref> and a [[Ghent\u2013Terneuzen Canal|new connection to the sea]] (1824\u201327).\n\nAfter the [[Belgian Revolution]], with the loss of port access to the sea for more than a decade, the local economy collapsed and the first Belgian trade union originated in Ghent. In 1913 there was a [[Exposition universelle et internationale (1913)|world exhibition in Ghent]].<ref name=\"visit.gent.be\"/> As a preparation for these festivities, the [[Sint-Pieters railway station]] was completed in 1912.\n\n===20th century===\nGhent was occupied by the Germans in both World Wars but escaped severe destruction.

Its centre is the largest [[Pedestrian zone|carfree area]] in Belgium. Highlights are the [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] with the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', the [[belfry of Ghent|belfry]], the [[Gravensteen castle]], and the splendid architecture along the old [[Graslei]] harbour. Ghent has established a blend between comfort of living and history; it is not a city-museum. The city of Ghent also houses three [[b\u00e9guinage]]s and numerous churches including Saint-Jacob's church, [[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Saint-Nicolas' church]], [[Saint Michael's church (Ghent)|Saint Michael's church]] and [[St. Stefanus, Ghent|St. Stefanus]].\n[[File:Lamgods open.jpg|thumb|The well-known ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', a 15th century painting by Hubert and Jan Van Eyck in [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]].]] \nIn the 19th century Ghent's most famous architect, [[Louis Roelandt]], built the university hall Aula, the opera house and the main courthouse. Highlights of modern architecture are the university buildings (the ''[[Boekentoren]]'' or Book Tower) by [[Henry Van de Velde]]. There are also a few theatres from diverse periods.\n\nThe beguinages, as well as the belfry and adjacent cloth hall, were recognized by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Sites]] in 1998 and 1999.\n\nThe [[Zebrastraat]], a social experiment in which an entirely renovated site unites living, economy and culture, can also be found in Ghent.\n\n[[Campo Santo, Ghent|Campo Santo]] is a famous Catholic burial site of the nobility and artists.\n\n===Museums===\nImportant museums in Ghent are the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent|Museum voor Schone Kunsten]] (Museum of Fine Arts), with paintings by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and many Flemish masters; the [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst|SMAK]] or Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (City Museum for Contemporary Art), with works of the 20th century, including [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Andy Warhol]]; and the [[Design Museum Gent]] with masterpieces of [[Victor Horta]] and [[Le Corbusier]]. The [[Huis van Alijn]] (House of the Alijn family) was originally a [[beguinage]] and is now a museum for folk art where theatre and puppet shows for children are presented. The ''Museum voor Industri\u00eble Archeologie en Textiel'' or MIAT displays the industrial strength of Ghent with recreations of workshops and stores from the 1800s and original spinning and weaving machines that remain from the time when the building was a weaving mill. The [[Ghent City Museum]] (Stadsmuseum, abbreviated STAM), is committed to recording and explaining the city's past and its inhabitants, and to preserving the present for future generations.\n\n===Restaurants and culinary traditions===\nIn Ghent and other regions of [[East-Flanders]], bakeries sell a donut-shaped bun called a \"mastel\" (plural \"mastellen\"), which is basically a bagel. \"Mastellen\" are also called \"[[Saint Hubert]] bread\", because on the Saint's feast day, which is 3 November, the bakers bring their batches to the early Mass to be blessed. Traditionally, it was thought that blessed mastellen immunized against [[rabies]].\n\nOther local delicacies are the praline chocolates from local producers such as [[Leonidas (chocolate)|Leonidas]], the [[cuberdon]]s or 'neuzekes' ('noses'), cone-shaped purple jelly-filled candies, 'babelutten' ('babblers'), hard butterscotch-like candy, and of course, on the more fiery side, the famous 'Tierenteyn', a hot but refined mustard that has some affinity to French 'Dijon' mustard.\n\n[[Carbonade flamande|Stoverij]] is a classic Flemish meat stew, preferably made with a generous addition of brown [[Trappist beer|'Trappist']] (strong abbey beer) and served with French fries. '[[Waterzooi]]' is a local stew originally made from freshwater fish caught in the rivers and creeks of Ghent, but nowadays often made with chicken instead of fish. It is usually served nouvelle-cuisine-style, and will be supplemented by a large pot on the side.\n\nThe city promotes a meat-free day on Thursdays called ''Donderdag Veggiedag''<ref>[http://www.vegetarisme.be/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=767 \"Ghent's veggie day: for English speaking visitors\"] on Vegetarisme.be</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8046970.stm \"Belgian city plans 'veggie' days\"] on [[BBC News]] (12 May 2009).</ref> with [[vegetarian]] food being promoted in public canteens for civil servants and elected councillors, in all city funded schools, and promotion of vegetarian eating options in town (through the distribution of \"veggie street maps\"). This campaign is linked to the recognition of the [[Environmental effects of meat production#Fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions|detrimental environmental effects of meat production]], which the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] has established to represent nearly one-fifth of global [[greenhouse gas emissions]].\n\nGhent has the world's largest number of vegetarian restaurants per capita.<ref name=\"dailymail\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2508846/Belgium-breaks-The-best-way-glorious-Ghent-On-wheels-.html |title=Belgium breaks: The best way to see glorious Ghent?

Also, every five years, an extensive botanical exhibition (''Gentse Florali\u00ebn'') takes place in [[Flanders Expo]] in Ghent, attracting numerous visitors to the city.\n\nThe [[Festival of Flanders]] had its 50th celebration in 2008. In Ghent it opens with the OdeGand City festivities that takes place on the second Saturday of September. Some 50 concerts take place in diverse locations throughout the medieval [[inner city]] and some 250 international artists perform. Other major Flemish cities hold similar events, all of which form part of the Festival of Flanders (Antwerp with ''[[Laus Polyphoniae]]''; Bruges with ''[[MAfestival Brugge|MAfestival]]''; Brussels with ''KlaraFestival''; Limburg with ''Basilica'', Mechelen and Brabant with ''Novecento'' and ''Transit'').\n\nThe city of Ghent will co-host the 2020 [[World Choir Games]] together with the city of [[Antwerp]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interkultur.com/newsroom/choir-games/details/news/double-gold-for-next-host-country-of-the-world-choir-games-2020/|title=Double gold for next host country of the World Choir Games 2020/|website=INTERKULTUR|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref> Organised by the [[Interkultur Foundation]], the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n===Nature===\nThe numerous parks in the city can also be considered tourist attractions.

They are often referred to as a single island. The department also includes the [[Dependencies of Guadeloupe]], which include the smaller islands of [[Marie-Galante]] and [[La D\u00e9sirade]], and the [[\u00celes des Saintes]].\n\nGuadeloupe, like the other overseas departments, is an integral part of France. As a constituent territory of the [[European Union]] and the [[Eurozone]],   the [[euro]]<ref>Guadeloupe is pictured on all [[Euro banknotes]]&nbsp;\u2013 on the reverse, at the bottom, to the right of the Greek \u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u03a9 (EURO), next to the denomination.</ref> is its official currency and any European Union citizen is free to settle and work there indefinitely.  As an overseas department, however, it is not part of the [[Schengen Area]]. The [[prefectures in France|prefecture]] (regional capital) of Guadeloupe is the city of [[Basse-Terre]], which lies on the island of the same name. The official language is [[French language|French]] and  [[Antillean Creole French|Antillean Creole]] is spoken virtually by the entire population except recent arrivals from [[metropolitan France]]. The island is called \"Gwadada\" by the [https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/Gwadada locals].\n\n== Origin of the name ==\n\n[[File:Guadeloupe - Location Map (2013) - GLP - UNOCHA.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Guadeloupe \u2013 Location Map \u2013 [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|UNOCHA]]]]\n[[Christopher Columbus]] named the island ''Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe'' in 1493 after the [[Virgin Mary]], venerated in the Spanish town of [[Guadalupe, C\u00e1ceres|Guadalupe]], in [[Extremadura]]. Upon becoming a French colony, the Spanish name was retained though altered to French orthography and phonology.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|History of Guadeloupe}}\n[[File:Combat naval 12 avril 1782-Dumoulin-IMG 5484.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Battle of the Saintes]] fought near Guadeloupe between France and Britain, 1782.]]\n[[File:Buste de Victor Schoelcher - Sainte-Anne - Guadeloupe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A bust of French abolitionist [[Victor Schoelcher]].]]\nThe island was called \"Karukera\" (or \"The Island of Beautiful Waters\") by the [[Arawak]] people, who settled on there in 300 AD/CE. During the 8th century, the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] inhabited the island.\n\nDuring his second trip to the Americas, in November 1493, [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on Guadeloupe, while seeking fresh water. He called it ''Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe de Extremadura'', after the image of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] venerated at the Spanish [[Royal Monastery of Santa Maria de Guadalupe|monastery of Villuercas]], in [[Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe|Guadalupe, Extremadura]]. The expedition set ashore just south of Capesterre, but left no settlers behind.\n\nColumbus is credited with discovering the [[pineapple]] on the island of Guadeloupe in 1493, although the fruit had long been grown in South America. He called it ''pi\u00f1a de Indias'', which can be correctly translated as \"pine cone of the Indies.\"<ref>[http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=pi%C3%B1a Entry for \"pi\u00f1a\"] in the Dictionary of the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola de la Lengua, definition #1.</ref><ref>[http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=pi%C3%B1a Entry for \"pi\u00f1a\"] in the bilingual Collins & WordReference Dictionaries</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reverso.net/spanish-english/pi%C3%B1a Entry for \"pi\u00f1a\"] on the bilingual Collins Reverso Dictionary, definition #1.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://homecooking.about.com/od/foodhistory/a/pineapplehist.htm |title=Pineapple History |publisher=Homecooking.about.com |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Caribs fought against the [[Spain|Spanish]] settlers and repelled them.\n\nAfter successful settlement on the island of St. Christophe ([[St. Kitts]]), the French [[Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique|Company of the American Islands]] delegated [[Charles Li\u00e8nard de l'Olive]] and [[Jean du Plessis d'Ossonville]] to colonize one or any of the region's islands, Guadeloupe, [[Martinique]], or [[Dominica]].\n\nDue to Martinique's inhospitable nature, the duo resolved to settle in Guadeloupe in 1635, took possession of the island, and wiped out many of the Carib Amerindians. It was annexed to the kingdom of France in 1674.\n\nOver the next century, the British seized the island several times. The economy benefited from the lucrative [[History of sugar|sugar trade]], which commenced during the closing decades of the 17th century. Guadeloupe produced more sugar than all the British islands combined, worth about \u00a36 million a year. The British [[British Invasion of Guadeloupe (1759)|captured Guadeloupe in 1759]]. The British government decided that Canada was strategically more important and kept Canada while returning Guadeloupe to France in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] that ended the [[France in the Seven Years War|Seven Years War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Colin G.

The ensuing conflict with the republicans, who were faithful to revolutionary France, caused a fire to break out in [[Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre]] that devastated a third of the town. The monarchists ultimately overcame the republicans and declared independence in 1791. The monarchists then refused to receive the new governor that Paris had appointed in 1792. In 1793, a slave rebellion broke out, which made the upper classes turn to the British and ask them to occupy the island.\n\nIn an effort to take advantage of the chaos ensuing from the French Revolution, Britain seized Guadeloupe in 1794, holding control from 21 April until December 1794, when republican governor [[Victor Hugues]] obliged the British general to surrender.<ref name=\"Hugues\">pg 241{{cite book |last = David Barry Gaspar (Editor), Darlene Clark Hine (Editor) |title = More Than Chattel: Black Women and Slavery in the Americas|edition= April 1996|page= 360 |publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn= 0-253-21043-7}} ''Hugues was able to use his expeditionary force of 1,500 men and an enthusiastic slave population to repel the British invasion of Guadeloupe after a seven-month struggle, which ended in December 1794.''</ref> Hugues succeeded in freeing the [[slavery|slaves]], who then turned on the slave owners who controlled the sugar plantations.\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte issued the [[Law of 20 May 1802]]. It restored slavery to all colonies the British had captured during the French Revolutionary Wars\u2014but did not apply to certain French overseas possessions, such as Guadeloupe, Guyane, and Saint-Domingue. Napoleon sent an expeditionary force to recapture the island from the rebellious slaves. [[Louis Delgr\u00e8s]] and a group of revolutionary soldiers killed themselves on the slopes of the Matouba volcano when it became obvious that the invading troops would take control of the island. The occupation force killed approximately 10,000 Guadeloupeans.\n\nOn 4 February 1810 the British once again seized the island and continued to occupy it until 1816. By the Anglo-Swedish alliance of 3 March 1813, Britain ceded it to [[Sweden]] for a brief period of 15 months. During this time, the British administration remained in place and British governors continued to govern the island.<ref>World Statesmen.org: [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Guadeloupe.html Guadeloupe]</ref>\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris of 1814]], Sweden ceded Guadeloupe once more to France. An ensuing settlement between Sweden and the British gave rise to the [[Guadeloupe Fund]]. The [[Treaty of Vienna (1815)|Treaty of Vienna]] in 1815 definitively acknowledged French control of Guadeloupe.\n\nAn [[1843 Guadeloupe earthquake|earthquake in 1843]] caused the [[La Soufri\u00e8re (volcano)|La Soufri\u00e8re]] volcano to erupt and killed over 5000 people.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-3325-3_38|title=The Illustrated History of Natural Disasters|date=27 October 2017|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|pages=163\u2013163|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3325-3_38}}</ref>\n\nSlavery was finally abolished on the island (and in all French possessions) on 28 May 1848 at the initiative of [[Victor Schoelcher]].\n\nGuadeloupe lost 12,000 of its 150,000 residents in the [[cholera]] epidemic of 1865\u201366.<ref>{{Cite book\n |first = Joseph Patrick\n |last = Byrne\n |title = Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues: A-M\n |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&pg=PA107&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false\n |publisher=ABC-CLIO\n |year = 2008\n |page = 107\n |isbn = 0-313-34102-8}}\n</ref>\n\nThe colonial history of Guadeloupe has been addressed in research publications.<ref>e.g. Faloppe, Josette.

Then in 1974, it became an administrative center. Its deputies sit in the French National Assembly in Paris.\n\nIn 1967, rallies became riots, and repression backed by the prefect [[Pierre Bolotte]] caused dozens of deaths.\n\nThe Guadeloupe Conference (Persian: \u06a9\u0646\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0633 \u06af\u0648\u0622\u062f\u0644\u0648\u067e\u200e) was a meeting held by four Western powers: the United States, the United Kingdom, France and West Germany in Guadeloupe Island from 4 to 7 January 1979.

The protesters have proposed that authorities \"lower business taxes as a top up to company finances\" to pay for the \u20ac200 pay raises. Employers and business leaders in Guadeloupe have said that they cannot afford the salary increase. The strike lasted 44 days, ending with an accord reached on 5 March 2009. Tourism suffered greatly during this time and affected the 2010 tourist season as well.\n\nThe [[2009 French Caribbean general strikes]] exposed deep ethnic, racial, and class tensions and disparities within Guadeloupe.<ref>\"[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gk4fdgdkSoLI7uwcWr8DPvufQdAg?hl=en Race, class fuel social conflict on French Caribbean islands]\".

This lack of space and shelter makes the population density even higher.\n\nBecause Guadeloupe is a wealthy country in comparison to the surrounding Caribbean islands, immigration is popular.

Throughout the island's colonial history, GC was the language of local community, of resistance to European domination, of ethno-racial identity. Consequently, when from the early 1970s to the mid 1980s, Guadeloupe saw the rise and fall of an at-times violent movement for (greater) political independence from France,<ref>Schnepel, Ellen.

''Hinduism Today'', Digital Edition, February 1998.</ref> cultures has given birth to some original new forms specific to the archipelago. Since the 1970s, Guadeloupean music increasingly claimed the local language, Guadeloupean Creole as the preferred language of popular music. Islanders enjoy many local dance styles including [[zouk]], [[zouk-love]], [[compas|kompa]], as well as the modern international dances such as hip hop, etc. One of his most famous artists was [[Henri Debs]] (1932-2013) a musician and producer of French, origin of Lebanese parents, who made many Caribbean rhythms like Zouk (Soca in Spanish) and Bel\u00e9 heard throughout the Antilles, France, North America and Latin America.\n\nTraditional Guadeloupean music includes [[biguine]], [[Cadence rampa|kadans]], [[cadence-lypso]], [[zouk music|zouk]], and [[gwo ka]]. Popular music artists and bands such as [[Experience 7]], [[Francky Vincent]], [[Kassav']] (which included [[Patrick St-Eloi]]), and [[Gilles Floro]] embody the traditional music style of the island and the new generation of music, while some other musical artists, like [[Tom Frager]] (who grew up in Guadeloupe), perform colorful reggae music that defines the Guadeloupe island as paradise-like. Many international festivals take place in Guadeloupe, like the Creole Blues Festival, hosted in [[Marie-Galante]]. All the Euro-French forms of art are also ubiquitous. The melting pot is emphasized by other communities (from [[Brazil]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], [[India]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]]), who live on the island and share their cultures.\n\nAnother element of Guadeloupean culture is its dress. A few women (particularly of the older generation) wear a unique style of traditional dress, with many layers of colourful fabric, now only worn on special occasions. On festive occasions they also wore a madras (originally a \"kerchief\" from South India) head scarf tied in many different symbolic ways, each with a different name. The headdress could be tied in the \"bat\" style, or the \"firefighter\" style, as well as the \"Guadeloupean woman\". Jewelry, mainly gold, is also important in the Guadeloupean lady's dress, a product of European, African and Indian inspiration.\n\n=== Crime ===\nGuadeloupe was the most violent overseas French department in 2016.<ref>[http://www.francetvinfo.fr/faits-divers/meurtres/guadeloupe-la-spirale-de-la-violence_1848359.html Guadeloupe : la spirale de la violence], francetvinfo.fr, 29 September 2016</ref> The high level of unemployment caused violence and crime to rise especially in 2009 and 2010, the years following a [[great recession|great worldwide recession]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/27/young-crime-unemployment-guadeloupe-france Borredon, Laurent.

It also depends on [[Metropolitan France|mainland France]] for large subsidies and imports.\n\nTourism is a key industry; an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditional [[sugarcane]] crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as [[banana]]s (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), [[eggplant]], and [[flower]]s. Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, mainly from France. Light industry features [[sugar]] and [[rum]] production. Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the young. Hurricanes periodically devastate the economy.\n\n== Primary industries ==\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nIn Guadeloupe, agriculture constituted 6 percent of GDP and employed 15 percent of the work-force in 1997, which equaled approximately 120,000. The main crops are sugarcane & bananas. Large sugar plantations that produce for both export and local consumption purposes continue to dominate. Sugarcane is grown on western and central parts of Grande-Terre due to its flatlands and rainfall of 1500 to 2500&nbsp; mm. & on the northeast section of Basse-Terre. There are rum distilleries to produce rum from sugar. Bananas are grown mainly on the western sides of the mountains on Basse-Terre & on the eastern coast of Basse-Terre. The growing of bananas for export began as early as 1922 but the trade grew rapidly when farmers planted bananas to replace their coffee and cocoa which had been destroyed by a hurricane in 1928. In 2000, 121,758 tons of bananas were exported, 72 percent of which were purchased by the French metropolis. In 1999, Guadeloupe formed 8.2% of the banana production in the Caribbean. Other export crops are [[coffee]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] & [[citrus fruit]].\n\n=== Animal husbandry ===\n[[Cattle]], [[goat]]s, [[pig]]s & [[poultry]] are raised for local consumption and provided most of the requirements of animal products. The rearing of animals is done both on Grande-Terre & Basse-Terre.\n\n=== Fishing ===\nOffshore fishing is a traditional source of food, and the main catches. By the end of the 1990s, 11 fishing farms were registered in Guadeloupe and experiments are under way to catch and market fish in order to respond to growing demand. The 1997 catch was 10,518 tons, mainly marine fish with some small amounts of crustaceans and molluscs.\n\n== Industry ==\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nIn 1997, industry in Guadeloupe constituted 9 percent of GDP and provided employment for 17 percent of the labor force. Major industrial activities include sugar refining, rum distilling, food processing, cement and brick manufacture, mineral water bottling, beverage making, chemical making, textile manufacture & electronics assembly. Jarry has an industrial free-port.\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe construction industry employs 12 percent of the workforce in Guadeloupe. Most of the construction sector is dominated by government in the form of public works. Such works provide an enormous boost to the economy and help relieve unemployment. Indeed, the 5,500 public work enterprises in the construction sector comprise 19 percent of all industrial enterprises and engage approximately 10 percent of the entire labor force. Construction has boomed with tourism to construct hotels, apartments and cottages.\n\n== Tertiary industries ==\nIn 1997, the service sector in Guadeloupe contributed 85 percent of GDP and provided employment for 68 percent of the labor force.\n\n=== Tourism ===\nTourism accounted for 8.9 percent of GDP in Guadeloupe in 2000. Tourism is the major earner for Guadeloupe. In 2000, the number of tourists to Guadeloupe was 623,000, a decrease from 693,000 tourists in 1998. A high percentage of tourists are from [[France]]: 83.3% visit from [[metropolitan France]], 10.8% come from the rest of Europe, 3.4% come from the United States, 1.5% come from Canada, 0.4% come from South America, and 0.6% come from the rest of the world.<ref name=\"Tourism\">{{cite web\n| year = 1998\n| url = http://perso.orange.fr/manioc.guadeloupe/guadeloupe/Guadeloupe%20-%20Economie.htm\n| title = Guadeloupe \u2013 Economie\n| language = FRENCH\n| accessdate =10 June 2006\n}}</ref>  350 cruise ships visited Guadeloupe in 1998. [[Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre]] is a cruise ship port. Tourism provides jobs such as hoteliers, waiters, tour guides & taxi drivers.\n\n=== Retail ===\nThere are many shopping centers especially in Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre where French perfumes, cosmetics & leather goods are sold along with local handicrafts as souvenirs. There is foreign direct investment such as McDonald's, KFC, and Subway have established operations in Guadeloupe. There are a number of small and medium-sized retail outlets.

It is generally agreed to have been created in the 9th century by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril]], a Byzantine monk from [[Thessaloniki]]. He and his brother, [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki|Saint Methodius]], were sent by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael III]] in 863 to [[Great Moravia]] to spread Christianity among the [[West Slavs]] in the area. The brothers decided to translate liturgical books into the Old Slavic language that was understandable to the general population, but as the words of that language could not be easily written by using either the Greek or Latin alphabets, Cyril decided to invent a new script, Glagolitic, which he based on the local dialect of the Slavic tribes from the Byzantine [[Thessalonica (theme)|theme of Thessalonica]].\n\nAfter the deaths of Cyril and Methodius, the Glagolitic alphabet ceased to be used in Moravia, but their students continued to propagate it in the  [[First Bulgarian Empire]], where it was subsequently also displaced by the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]]. The Glagolitic alphabet was preserved only by the clergy of [[Croatia]] to write [[Church Slavonic]] until the early 19th century.\n\n==Name==\nThe name was not created until many centuries after the script's creation, and comes from the [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[wikt:\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044a|\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044a]] ''glagol'' \"utterance\". The verb ''glagolati'' means \"to speak\". It has been conjectured that the name ''glagolitsa'' developed in [[Croatia]] around the 14th century and was derived from the word ''glagolity'', applied to adherents of the liturgy in Slavonic.<ref>Bernard Comrie and Greville G.

Twenty-four of the 41 original Glagolitic letters (see table below) probably derive from graphemes of the medieval cursive [[Greek minuscule|Greek small alphabet]] but have been given an [[ornament (art)|ornamental]] design.\n\nThe source of the other consonantal letters is unknown. If they were added by Cyril, it is likely that they were taken from an alphabet used for Christian scripture. It is frequently proposed that the letters ''sha'' {{Script|Glag|\u2c1e}}, ''tsi'' {{Script|Glag|\u2c1c}}, and ''cherv'' {{Script|Glag|\u2c1d}} were taken from the letters ''[[Shin (letter)|shin]]'' \u05e9 and ''[[tsadi]]'' \u05e6 of the [[Hebrew alphabet]], and that \u2c06 ''zhivete'' derives from [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] ''janja'' \u03ea.<ref>{{cite book | title=The World's Writing Systems | year=1996 | editor1-first=Peter T. | editor1-last=Daniels | editor1-link=Peter T.

Other proposals include the [[Samaritan alphabet]], which Cyril learned during his journey to the [[Khazars]] in [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].\n\nGlagolitic letters were also used as numbers, similarly to [[Cyrillic numerals]]. Unlike Cyrillic numerals, which inherited their numeric value from the corresponding Greek letter (see [[Greek numerals]]), Glagolitic letters were assigned values based on their native alphabetic order.\n\nThe two monks later canonized as Saints Cyril and Methodius, brothers from [[Thessaloniki]], were sent to [[Great Moravia]] in 862 by the [[Byzantine emperor]] at the request of Prince [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], who wanted to weaken the dependence of his country on [[East Francia|East Frankish]] priests. The Glagolitic alphabet, however it originated, was used between 863 and 885 for government and religious documents and books and at the Great Moravian Academy (''Ve\u013ekomoravsk\u00e9 u\u010dili\u0161te'') founded by the missionaries, where their followers were educated. The [[Kiev Missal]], found in the 19th century in Jerusalem, was dated to the 10th century.\n\nIn 886 an East Frankish bishop of [[Nitra]] named [[Wiching]] banned the script and jailed 200 followers of Methodius, mostly students of the original academy. They were then dispersed or, according to some sources, sold as slaves by the Franks. Many of them (including [[Naum of Preslav|Naum]],  [[Clement of Ohrid|Clement]], Angelarious, Sava and Gorazd), however, reached [[Bulgaria]] and were commissioned by [[Boris I of Bulgaria]] to teach and instruct the future clergy of the state in the [[Slavic language]]s. After the adoption of Christianity in Bulgaria in 865, religious ceremonies and [[Divine Liturgy]] were conducted in [[Greek language|Greek]] by clergy sent from the [[Byzantine Empire]], using the [[Byzantine rite]]. Fearing growing Byzantine influence and weakening of the state, Boris viewed the introduction of the Slavic alphabet and language into church use as a way to preserve the independence of the Bulgarian Empire from Byzantine [[Constantinople]]. As a result of Boris' measures, two academies, one in [[Ohrid Literary School|Ohrid]] and one in [[Preslav Literary School|Preslav]], were founded.\n\n===Spread===\n\nFrom there, the students travelled to other places and spread the use of their alphabet. Some went to [[Croatia]] ([[Dalmatia]]), where the squared variant arose and where Glagolitic remained in use for a long time. In 1248, [[Pope Innocent IV]] granted the Croatians of southern Dalmatia the unique privilege of using their own language and this script in the [[Roman Rite]] liturgy. Formally granted to bishop Philip of [[Senj]], permission to use the Glagolitic liturgy (the [[Roman Rite]] conducted in the [[Slavic language]] instead of [[Latin]], not the [[Byzantine rite]]), actually extended to all Croatian lands, mostly along the [[Adriatic]] coast. The [[Holy See]] had several Glagolitic [[missal]]s published in Rome. Authorization for the use of this language was extended to some other Slavic regions between 1886 and 1935.<ref>\"The right to use the Glagolitic language at Mass with the Roman Rite has prevailed for many centuries in all the south-western Balkan countries, and has been sanctioned by long practice and by many popes...\" [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04606b.htm ''Dalmatia''], ''Catholic Encyclopedia''; \"In 1886 it arrived to the Principality of Montenegro, followed by the Kingdom of Serbia in 1914, and the Republic of Czechoslovakia in 1920, but only for feast days of the main patron saints. The 1935 concordat with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia anticipated the introduction of the Slavic liturgy for all Croatian regions and throughout the entire state...\" [http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/japun.html ''The Croatian Glagolitic Heritage''], Marko Japundzi\u0107.</ref> In missals, the Glagolitic script was eventually replaced with the Latin alphabet, but the use of the [[Slavic language]] in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] continued, until replaced by modern vernacular languages.\n\nSome students of the Ohrid academy went to [[Bohemia]] where the alphabet was used in the 10th and 11th centuries, along with other scripts. It is not clear whether the Glagolitic alphabet was used in the [[Jaxa of K\u00f6penick|Duchy of Kopnik]] before the [[Wendish Crusade]], but it was certainly used in [[Kievan Rus']].\n\nIn Croatia, from the 12th century, Glagolitic inscriptions appeared mostly in littoral areas: [[Istria]], Primorje, [[Kvarner]], and Kvarner islands, notably [[Krk]], [[Cres]], and [[Lo\u0161inj]]; in Dalmatia, on the islands of Zadar, but there were also findings in inner [[Lika]] and [[Krbava]], reaching to [[Kupa]] river, and even as far as [[Me\u0111imurje]] and [[Slovenia]].\nThe ''[[Hrvoje's Missal]]'' ({{lang-hr|Hrvojev misal}}) from 1404 was written in [[Split (city)|Split]], and it is considered one of the most beautiful Croatian Glagolitic books. The 1483 ''[[Missale Romanum Glagolitice]]'' was the first printed Croatian Glagolitic book.\n\nIt was believed that Glagolitsa in Croatia was present only in those areas. But, in 1992, the discovery of Glagolitic inscriptions in churches along the [[Orljava]] river in [[Slavonia]] totally changed the picture (churches in [[Brodski Drenovac]], [[Lov\u010di\u0107]], and some others), showing that use of the Glagolitic alphabet was spread from Slavonia also.<ref>{{hr icon}} [http://www.sbtv.hr/Vijesti/2007%20vijesti/04%202007%20travanj/SB_INFO_2007-01%2003.htm ''\"Glagolja\u0161ka ba\u0161tina u Slavonskom Koba\u0161u\"''], ''Slavonskobrodska televizija'', News from February 25, 2007.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 9th century, one of these students of Methodius &ndash; Naum, who had settled in [[Preslav, Bulgaria]] &ndash; created the [[Cyrillic script]]{{Dubious|date=August 2017}}, which almost entirely replaced Glagolitic during the [[Middle Ages]]. The Cyrillic alphabet is derived from the Greek alphabet, with some letters (like \u27e8\u0448\u27e9, \u27e8\u0446\u27e9, \u27e8\u0447\u27e9, \u27e8\u044a\u27e9, \u27e8\u044c\u27e9, \u27e8\u0463\u27e9) peculiar to Slavic languages being derived from the Hebrew alphabet. The decision{{Which|date=August 2017}}{{By whom|date=August 2017}} in favor of Cyrillic created an alphabetical difference between the two literary centres of the Bulgarian state in Pliska and Ohrid. In the western part the Glagolitic alphabet remained dominant at first. However, subsequently in the next two centuries, mostly after the fall of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], Glagolitic gradually ceased to be used there at all.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3o5lrvuwOVwC&pg=PA146 |title=East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000\u20131500 |first=Jean W. |last=Sedlar |publisher=University of Washington Press |page=146 |accessdate=2013-05-01|isbn=9780295972916 |year=1994 }}</ref> Nevertheless, particular passages or words written with the Glagolitic alphabet appeared in Bulgarian Cyrillic manuscripts till the end of the 14th century.<ref>\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u0411. \u041a\u044a\u0441\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430. \u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e-\u041c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0438, \u043a\u043d. 12, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, 1999, 87\u2013152.</ref>\n\nSporadic instances aside, Glagolitic survived beyond the 12th century as a primary script in Croatia alone, although from there a brief attempt at reintroduction was made in the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] area in the 14th century. The centre of influence appears to have been in the [[Kvarner Gulf]], though the nature and extent of this influence remain subjects of debate. The early development of the Glagolitic minuscule script alongside the increasingly square majuscule is poorly documented, but before the advent of printing, a mutual relationship evolved between the two varieties; the majuscule being used primarily for inscriptions and higher liturgical uses, and the minuscule being applied to both religious and secular documents. Ignoring the problematic early Slavonian inscriptions, the use of the Glagolitic script at its peak before the [[Croatian-Ottoman wars]] corresponded roughly to the area that spoke the [[Chakavian]] dialect at the time, in addition to, to varying extents, the adjacent [[Kajkavian]] regions within the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb|Zagreb bishopric]]. As a result, vernacular impact on the liturgical language and script largely stems from Chakavian sub-dialects.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Decline===\n\nThe first major threat to Croatian Glagolitic since it attained stability was from the Ottoman excursions, though the extent of cultural damage varied locally depending on the course of war. In the 17th century, though, the first successful direct attack on the script since the 12th century was headed by the Bishop of Zagreb, and after the [[Magnate conspiracy]] left the script without secular protectors, its use was limited to the littoral region. In the meantime, printing gradually overtook handwriting for liturgical manuscripts, resulting in a decline of the majuscule script, which was absorbed for titular and sometimes initial use within for minuscule documents. It was not until the late 18th century and the onset of modernity that Glagolitic received significant further threats, and through western influence, especially secular, Glagolitic culture collapsed, so that by the mid 19th century, the script was purely liturgical, relying mostly on printed materials. By the time of the devastating [[Italianization]] movements under [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] in the early 20th century, numerous independent events had already greatly reduced the area of the liturgical use of Glagolitic.<ref>{{cite book |last=Strohal |first=Rudolf |date=1915 |title=Hrvatska glagolska knjiga |trans-title=Croatian Glagolitic Book |url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=AXg4AAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y |language=hr |location=Zagreb |publisher=Merkur |isbn=}}</ref>\n\n==Versions of authorship and name==\nThe tradition that the alphabet was designed by Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius has not been universally accepted. A less common belief, contradicting [[allochthon]]ic [[Slavic peoples#Origins and Slavic homeland debate|Slovene]] origin, was that the Glagolitic was created or used in the 4th century by [[St. Jerome]] ([[Latin]]: ''Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus''), hence the alphabet is sometimes named '''Hieronymian'''.\n\nIt is also [[Acrophony|acrophonically]] called '''azbuki''' from the names of its first two letters in Bulgaria, on the same model as \"alpha\" + \"beta\". The Slavs of [[Great Moravia]] (present-day [[Slovakia]] and [[Moravia]]), [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Slavonia]] were called ''Slov\u011bne'' at that time, which gives rise to the name '''Slovenish''' for the alphabet. Some other, rarer, names for this alphabet are '''Bukvitsa''' (from common Slavic word \"bukva\" meaning \"letter\", and a suffix \"-itsa\") and '''Illyrian'''.\n\n===Hieronymian version===\nIn the Middle Ages, Glagolitsa was also known as \"St. Jerome's script\" due to popular mediaeval legend (created by Croatian scribes in the 13th century) ascribing its invention to [[St. Jerome]] (342\u2013429). That claim, however, has been resolutely{{clarify|date=February 2015}} disproven.\n<!--\nNote to editors: the \"name\" \"Sanctvm Hieronymum Illiricaru(m) Litterarum\" does not exist: these Latin words are just an initial part of a sentence, not a terminological unit: ''To St. Jerome, the inventor of Illyrian letters...'' etc. The image http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Rocca.PNG is referred to above.  Thus, it is not necessary to make the second reference here.\n-->\n{{quotation|Until the end of the 18th century, a strange but widespread opinion dominated that the Glagolitic writing system, which was in use in Dalmatia and Istria along with neighboring islands, including the translation of the Holy Scripture, owe their existence to the famous church father St. Jerome. Knowing him as the author of the Latin [[Vulgate]], considering him \u2013 by his own words, born on the border between Dalmatia and Pannonia (remembering that the Dalmatian borders extended well into Istria at that time) \u2013 presumed to be an Illyrian, the self-styled Slavic intellectuals in Dalmatia very early began to ascribe to him the invention of ''glagolitsa'', possibly with the intention of more successfully defending both Slavic writing and the Slavic holy service against prosecutions and prohibitions from Rome's hierarchy, thus using the opinion of the famous Latin Father of the Church to protect their church rituals which were inherited from the Greeks Cyril and Methodius. We do not know who was the first to put in motion this unscientifically-based tradition about Jerome's authorship of the Glagolitic script and translation of the Holy Scripture, but in 1248 this version came to the knowledge of Pope Innocent IV. <...> The belief in Jerome as an inventor of the Glagolitic lasted many centuries, not only in his homeland, i.e. in Dalmatia and Croatia, not only in Rome, due to Slavs living there... but also in the West. In the 14th century, Croatian monks brought the legend to the Czechs, and even the Emperor Charles IV believed them.<ref>\u0414\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0430 XVIII \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430

Word ''Dzianina'', till today mean woven textile.\n-->\n\n===Pre-Glagolitic Slavic writing systems===\n{{further|Pre-Christian Slavic writing}}\nA hypothetical pre-Glagolitic writing system is typically referred to as ''[[cherty i rezy]]'' (strokes and incisions)<ref>[[Chernorizets Hrabar]] ''An Account of Letters''; Preslav 895, Bulgaria; Oldest manuscript 1348</ref> &ndash; but no material evidence of the existence of any pre-Glagolitic Slavic writing system has been found, except for a few brief and vague references in old chronicles and \"lives of the saints\". All artifacts presented as evidence of pre-Glagolitic Slavic inscriptions have later been identified as texts in known scripts and in known non-Slavic languages, or as fakes.<ref>L. Niederle, \"Slovansk\u00e9 staro\u017eitnosti\" (Slavic antiquities), III 2, 735; citation can be found in Vajs 1932, p. 4.</ref> The well-known [[Chernorizets Hrabar]]'s ''strokes and incisions'' are usually considered to be a reference to a kind of property mark or alternatively fortune-telling signs. Some \"Ruthenian letters\" found in one version of St. Cyril's life are explainable as misspelled \"Syrian letters\" (in Slavic, the roots are very similar: ''rus-'' vs. ''sur-'' or ''syr-''), etc.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe values of many of the letters are thought to have been displaced under Cyrillic influence or to have become confused through the early spread to different dialects so the original values are not always clear. For instance, the letter ''yu'' \u2c23 is thought to have perhaps originally had the sound /u/ but was displaced by the adoption of an ''o\u0475'' ligature \u2c16 under the influence of later Cyrillic. Other letters were late creations after a Cyrillic model.\n\nThe following table lists each letter in its modern order, showing an image of the letter (round variant), the corresponding modern Cyrillic letter, the approximate sound transcribed with the [[help:IPA|IPA]], the name, and suggestions for its origin. Several letters have no modern counterpart.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2|Letter\n! Cyrillic\n! Sound\n! [[Old Church Slavonic|OCS]] name\n! [[Church Slavonic language|CS]] name\n!

Some authors use (''a'',''b'').<ref name=\"Long 1972 33\" /><ref name=\"Pettofrezzo 1970 34\" /><ref name=\"Hardy&Wright 1979 20\" /><ref>{{harvtxt|Andrews|1994|p=16}} explains his choice of notation: \"Many authors write (''a'',''b'') for {{nowrap|g.c.d.(''a'',''b'')}}. We do not, because we shall often use (''a'',''b'') to represent a point in the Euclidean plane.\"</ref>\n\n=== Example ===\n\nWhat is the greatest common divisor of 54 and 24? \n\nThe number 54 can be expressed as a product of two integers in several different ways:\n: <math> 54 \\times 1 = 27 \\times 2 = 18 \\times 3 = 9 \\times 6. \\, </math>\n\nThus the '''divisors of 54''' are:  <math> 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. \\, </math>\n\nSimilarly, '''the divisors of 24''' are:  <math> 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. \\, </math>\n\nThe numbers that these two lists share in common are the '''common divisors''' of 54 and 24:\n\n: <math> 1, 2, 3, 6. \\, </math>\n\nThe greatest of these is 6. That is, the '''greatest common divisor''' of 54 and 24. One writes:\n\n: <math> \\gcd(54,24) = 6. \\, </math>\n\n=== Reducing fractions ===\n{{further|Irreducible fraction}}\nThe greatest common divisor is useful for reducing [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s to be [[Irreducible fraction|in lowest terms]]. For example, gcd(42,&nbsp;56)&nbsp;=&nbsp;14, therefore,\n\n:<math>\\frac{42}{56}=\\frac{3 \\cdot 14 }{ 4 \\cdot 14}=\\frac{3 }{ 4}.</math>\n\n=== Coprime numbers ===\nTwo numbers are called ''relatively prime'', or ''[[coprime]]'', if their greatest common divisor equals 1. For example, 9 and 28 are relatively prime.\n\n=== A geometric view ===\n[[File:24x60.svg|thumb|upright|alt=\"Tall, slender rectangle divided into a grid of squares. The rectangle is two squares wide and five squares tall.\"|A 24-by-60 rectangle is covered with ten 12-by-12 square tiles, where 12 is the GCD of 24 and 60. More generally, an ''a''-by-''b'' rectangle can be covered with square tiles of side length ''c'' only if ''c'' is a common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''.]]\nFor example, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12&nbsp;=&nbsp;2) and five squares along the other (60/12&nbsp;=&nbsp;5).\n\n== Calculation ==<!-- Section linked from [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] -->\n\n=== Using prime factorizations ===\nGreatest common divisors can in principle be computed by determining the [[prime factorization]]s of the two numbers and comparing factors, as in the following example: to compute gcd(18,&nbsp;84), we find the prime factorizations 18&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&nbsp;\u00b7&nbsp;3<sup>2</sup> and 84&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u00b7&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00b7&nbsp;7 and notice that the \"overlap\" of the two expressions is 2&nbsp;\u00b7&nbsp;3; so gcd(18,&nbsp;84)&nbsp;=&nbsp;6. In practice, this method is only feasible for small numbers; computing prime factorizations in general takes far too long.\n\nHere is another concrete example, illustrated by a [[Venn diagram]]. Suppose it is desired to find the greatest common divisor of 48 and&nbsp;180. First, find the prime factorizations of the two numbers:\n\n: 48 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3,\n: 180 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nWhat they share in common is two \"2\"s and a \"3\":\n\n:[[File:least common multiple.svg|300px]]<ref>[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/UnderstandingTheLeastCommonMultipleAndGreatestCommonDivisor/ Gustavo Delfino, \"Understanding the Least Common Multiple and Greatest Common Divisor\", [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]], Published: February 1, 2013. ]\n</ref> \n\n: Least common multiple = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 ( 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 ) \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 720\n: Greatest common divisor = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\n=== Using Euclid's algorithm ===\nA much more efficient method is the [[Euclidean algorithm]], which uses a [[division algorithm]] such as [[long division]] in combination with the observation that the gcd of two numbers also divides their difference. To compute gcd(48,18), divide 48 by 18 to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 12. Then divide 18 by 12 to get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 6. Then divide 12 by 6 to get a remainder of 0, which means that 6 is the gcd. Note that we ignored the quotient in each step except to notice when the remainder reached 0, signalling that we had arrived at the answer. Formally the algorithm can be described as:\n\n:<math>\\gcd(a,0) = a</math>\n:<math>\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(b, a \\,\\mathrm{mod}\\, b)</math>,\nwhere\n:<math> a \\,\\mathrm{mod}\\, b = a - b \\left\\lfloor {a \\over b} \\right\\rfloor </math>.\n<!-- \\bmod seem to get inadequate spacing, and \\: is completely unrecognised by the parser! -->\n\nIf the arguments are both greater than zero then the algorithm can be written in more elementary terms as follows:\n\n:<math>\\gcd(a,a) = a</math>, \n:<math>\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(a - b,b)\\quad,</math>  if ''a'' > ''b''\n:<math>\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(a, b-a)\\quad,</math> if ''b'' > ''a''\n\n[[File:The Great Common Divisor of 62 and 36 is 2.ogv|thumb|Animation showing an application of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 62 and 36, which is 2.]]\n\n=== Binary method ===\n\nAn alternative method of computing the gcd is the binary gcd method which uses only subtraction and division by 2.\nIn outline the method is as follows: Let ''a'' and ''b'' be the two non negative integers. Also set the integer ''d'' to 0.  There are five possibilities:\n* ''a'' = ''b''.\nAs gcd(''a'', ''a'') = ''a'', the desired gcd is ''a'' \u00d7 2<sup>''d''</sup> (as ''a'' and ''b'' are changed in the other cases, and ''d'' records the number of times that ''a'' and ''b'' have been both divided by 2 in the next step, the gcd of the initial pair is the product of ''a'' and 2<sup>''d''</sup>).\n\n* Both ''a'' and ''b'' are even.\nIn this case 2 is a common divisor. Divide both ''a'' and ''b'' by 2, increment ''d'' by 1 to record the number of times 2 is a common divisor and continue.\n\n* ''a'' is even and ''b'' is odd.\nIn this case 2 is not a common divisor. Divide ''a'' by 2 and continue.\n\n* ''a'' is odd and ''b'' is even.\nAs in the previous case 2 is not a common divisor. Divide ''b'' by 2 and continue.\n\n* Both ''a'' and ''b'' are odd.\nAs gcd(''a'',''b'') = gcd(''b'',''a'') and we have already considered the case ''a'' = ''b'', we may assume that ''a'' > ''b''. The number ''c'' = ''a'' \u2212 ''b'' is smaller than ''a'' yet still positive. Any number that divides ''a'' and ''b'' must also divide ''c'' so every common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'' is also a common divisor of ''b'' and ''c''. Similarly, ''a'' = ''b'' + ''c'' and every common divisor of ''b'' and ''c'' is also a common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''. So the two pairs (''a'', ''b'')  and (''b'', ''c'') have the same common divisors, and thus gcd(''a'',''b'') = gcd(''b'',''c''). Moreover, as ''a'' and ''b'' are both odd, ''c'' is even, and one may replace ''c'' by ''c''/2 without changing the gcd. Thus the process can be continued with the pair (''a'', ''b'') replaced by the smaller numbers (''c''/2, ''b'').\n\nEach of the above steps reduces at least one of ''a'' and ''b'' towards 0 and so can only be repeated a finite number of times. Thus one must eventually reach the case ''a'' = ''b'', which is the only stopping case. Then, as quoted above, the gcd is ''a'' \u00d7 2<sup>''d''</sup>.\n\nThis algorithm may easily be programmed as follows:\n '''Input:''' ''a'', ''b'' positive integers\n '''Output:''' ''g'' and ''d'' such that ''g'' is odd and gcd(''a'', ''b'') = ''g'' \u00d7 2<sup>''d''</sup>\n     ''d'' := 0\n     '''while''' ''a'' and ''b'' are both even '''do'''\n         ''a'' := ''a''/2\n         ''b'' := ''b''/2\n         ''d'' := ''d'' + 1\n     '''while''' ''a'' \u2260 ''b'' '''do'''\n         '''if''' ''a'' is even '''then''' ''a'' := ''a''/2\n         '''else if''' ''b'' is even '''then''' ''b'' := ''b''/2\n         '''else if''' ''a'' > ''b'' '''then''' ''a'' := (''a'' \u2013 ''b'')/2\n         '''else''' ''b'' := (''b'' \u2013 ''a'')/2\n     ''g'' := ''a''\n     '''output''' ''g'', ''d''\n\nExample: (''a'', ''b'', ''d'') = (48,  18, 0) \u2192 (24, 9, 1) \u2192 (12, 9, 1) \u2192 (6, 9, 1) \u2192 (3, 9, 1) \u2192 (3, 6, 1) \u2192 (3, 3, 1) ; the original gcd is thus 2<sup>''d''</sup> = 2<sup>1</sup> times ''a''= ''b''= 3, that is 6.\n\nThe Binary GCD algorithm is particularly easy to implement on binary computers. The test for whether a number is divisible by two can be performed by testing the lowest bit in the number. Division by two can be achieved by shifting the input number by one bit. Each step of the algorithm makes at least one such shift. Subtracting two numbers smaller than ''a'' and ''b'' costs <math>O(\\log a+\\log b)</math> bit operations. Each step makes at most one such subtraction.

If {{mvar|R}} is an [[integral domain]] then any two gcd's of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} must be [[associate elements]], since by definition either one must divide the other; indeed if a gcd exists, any one of its associates is a gcd as well. Existence of a gcd is not assured in arbitrary integral domains. However if {{mvar|R}} is a [[unique factorization domain]], then any two elements have a gcd, and more generally this is true in [[gcd domain]]s.\nIf {{mvar|R}} is a [[Euclidean domain]] in which euclidean division is given algorithmically (as is the case for instance when ''R'' = ''F''[''X''] where {{mvar|F}} is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], or when {{mvar|R}} is the ring of [[Gaussian integer]]s), then greatest common divisors can be computed using a form of the Euclidean algorithm based on the division procedure.\n\nThe following is an example of an integral domain with two elements that do not have a gcd:\n\n:<math>R = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\sqrt{-3}\\,\\,\\right],\\quad a = 4 = 2\\cdot 2 = \\left(1+\\sqrt{-3}\\,\\,\\right)\\left(1-\\sqrt{-3}\\,\\,\\right),\\quad b = \\left(1+\\sqrt{-3}\\,\\,\\right)\\cdot 2.</math>\n\nThe elements 2 and 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sqrt|\u22123}} are two \"maximal common divisors\" (i.e. any common divisor which is a multiple of 2 is associated to 2, the same holds for 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sqrt|\u22123}}, but they are not associated, so there is no greatest common divisor of {{mvar|a}} and&nbsp;''b''.\n\nCorresponding to the B\u00e9zout property we may, in any commutative ring, consider the collection of elements of the form ''pa''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''qb'', where {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} range over the ring. This is the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, and is denoted simply (''a'',&nbsp;''b''). In a ring all of whose ideals are principal (a [[principal ideal domain]] or PID), this ideal will be identical with the set of multiples of some ring element ''d''; then this {{mvar|d}} is a greatest common divisor of {{mvar|a}} and ''b''. But the ideal (''a'',&nbsp;''b'') can be useful even when there is no greatest common divisor of {{mvar|a}} and ''b''. (Indeed, [[Ernst Kummer]] used this ideal as a replacement for a gcd in his treatment of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], although he envisioned it as the set of multiples of some hypothetical, or ''ideal'', ring element {{mvar|d}}, whence the ring-theoretic term.)\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Binary GCD algorithm]]\n* [[Coprime]]\n* [[Euclidean algorithm]]\n* [[Extended Euclidean algorithm]]\n* [[Least common multiple]]\n* [[Lowest common denominator]]\n* [[Maximal common divisor]]\n* [[Polynomial greatest common divisor]]\n* [[B\u00e9zout domain]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citation |last=Andrews |first=George E. |author-link=George Andrews (mathematician) |year=1994 |origyear=1971 |title=Number Theory |publisher=Dover |publication-place= |page= |isbn=9780486682525 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVwvvwZeBf4C |accessdate= }}\n*{{citation\n  | last1 = Hardy  | first1 = G.

(optional)\n# Garnishes may be made with fresh bell pepper slices, diced tomatoes and cucumber, or other fresh ingredients.\n\nTraditionally, gazpacho was made by pounding the vegetables in a [[mortar and pestle|mortar with a pestle]]; this more laborious method is still sometimes used as it helps keep the gazpacho cool and avoids the foam and the completely smooth consistency created by blenders and food processors.<ref name=kate/> A traditional way of preparation is to pound garlic cloves in a mortar, add a little soaked stale bread, then olive oil and salt, to make a paste. Then very ripe tomatoes and vinegar are added. In the days before refrigeration the gazpacho was left in an [[Evaporative cooler#Physical principles|unglazed earthenware pot to cool by evaporation]], and some water added.<ref name=andalucia/>\n[[Image:Dicey gazpacho.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Portuguese Gazpacho made with diced ingredients]]\nGazpacho may be served with garnishes, served separately, such as hard boiled eggs and chopped ham (in the [[salmorejo]] variety from C\u00f3rdoba), chopped almonds, cumin crushed with mint, orange segments, finely chopped green pepper, onion, tomato or cucumber.<ref name=andalucia>[http://www.andalucia.com/magazine/english/ed3/gazpacho.htm King Gazpacho, Andalucia Magazine.] Retrieved 6 July 2007.</ref> In [[Extremadura]], gazpacho with local ham, added to the gazpacho rather than as a garnish, is called ''gazpacho extreme\u00f1o''. Andalusian sources say that gazpacho should be slightly chilled, but not iced.<ref name=andalucia/>\n\n==Variations==\nIngredients, texture, and how thick the gazpacho is made vary regionally and between families.\n\nSimilar cold raw soups such as [[Arjamolho]] in Portugal, [[salmorejo]], [[porra antequerana]] and [[ajoblanco]], are also popular in Andalusia, although not as widespread as gazpacho.\n\n''[[Gazpacho manchego]]'', despite its name, is a meat [[stew]], served hot, not a variation on the cold vegetable soup.\n\n===In Spain===\nThe original recipe using bread, water, vinegar, oil and salt is traditional in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], perhaps going back to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. Every Andalusian region or comarca has its own variety. The humble gazpacho became a very deeply rooted food for [[peasant]]s and [[shepherd]]s in the south of Spain. The basic gazpacho gave rise to many variants, some also called gazpacho, others not; some authors have tried to classify all these variations. Gazpachos may be classified by colour: the most usual red ones (which contain tomato), white ones (which contain no tomato, but include [[dried fruit]]s), and green ones (which are white but contain some spices that make them green). These variants have their basic ingredients in common, [[garlic]] paste which works as an emulsifier, [[bread]], [[olive oil]], [[vinegar]] and [[salt]]. To the traditional ingredients red fruits such as [[Fragaria|strawberries]], [[muskmelon]], etc., may be added, making the gazpacho a bit sweeter. Gazpacho may be served as a starter, main dish, or [[Tapas|tapa]].\n\n====Arranque rote\u00f1o====\nA popular variation comes from the town of [[Rota, Spain|Rota]] in the [[province of Cadiz]].  During times of drought there was not enough water to make gazpacho; arranque has the same ingredients as gazpacho, but uses less water and bread, making it a sort of cream. Some people add more bread until it takes on the consistency of a dip.\n\n====Extremaduran variations====\n[[File:Gazpacho extreme\u00f1o.jpg|thumb|Gazpacho extreme\u00f1o]]\nIn [[Extremadura]], gazpachos are a kind of pur\u00e9e or thick gazpacho known as ''cojondongo'', or ''cojondongo del ga\u00f1\u00e1n'',<ref>[http://turismo.badajoz.es/web/modules.php?name=recetas&ide=13%20target= ''Cojondongo del ga\u00f1\u00e1n''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425082610/http://turismo.badajoz.es/web/modules.php?name=recetas&ide=13%20target= |date=25 April 2012 }} en la web de Turismo de la provincia de Badajoz.</ref> made of breadcrumbs, garlic, oil, and vinegar, then topped with chopped onions, tomato and peppers.<ref>Lescure Beruete, Luis Felipe.

In this case, the omission of the ''\u0113'' is, as the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) calls it, a blunder. Paracelsus uses ''Gnomi'' as a synonym of ''[[Pygm\u00e6i]]'' and classifies them as earth [[elemental]]s.

Gnomes are used in [[Alexander Pope]]'s \"[[The Rape of the Lock]]\". The creatures from this mock-epic are small, celestial creatures which were prudish women in their past-lives, and now spend all of eternity looking out for prudish women (in parallel to the guardian angels in Catholic belief). Other uses of the term ''gnome'' remain obscure until the early 19th century, when it is taken up by authors of [[Romanticist]] collections of [[fairy tale]]s and becomes mostly synonymous with the older word ''[[goblin]]''.\n\nPope's stated source, the French satire ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'' (1670), used the term ''gnomide'' to refer to female gnomes (often \"gnomid\" in English translations).<ref>{{cite book |url=http://sacred-texts.com/eso/cdg/index.htm |title=Comte de Gabalis |publisher=The Brothers, Old Bourne Press |location=London |first=N.-P.-H. |last=de Montfaucon de Villars |date=1913 |origyear=1670 |oclc=6624965 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513012258/http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/cdg/index.htm |archivedate=13 May 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The author of this work, [[Nicolas-Pierre-Henri de Montfaucon de Villars]], the abbot of Villars, describes gnomes as such:\n<blockquote>\"The Earth is filled almost to the Center with ''Gnomes'' or ''Pharyes'', a People of small Stature, the Guardians of Treasures, of Mines, and of Precious Stones.

[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] in ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]'' (1837) contrasts the two in \"Small enough to be king of the fairies, and ugly enough to be king of the gnomes\" (cited after [[OED]]). Similarly, gnomes are contrasted to [[elf|elves]], as in [[William Cullen Bryant]]'s ''Little People of the Snow'' (1877), which has \"let us have a tale of elves that ride by night, with jingling reins, or gnomes of the mine\" (cited after [[OED]]).\n\nOne of the first movements in [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky's]] 1874 work ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', named \"Gnomus\" ([[Latin]] for \"The Gnome\"), is written to sound as if a gnome is moving about, his movements constantly changing in speed.{{listen|type=music|filename=Modest Mussorgsky - pictures at an exhibition - i. gnomus - vivo.ogg|title=Gnomus|description=|format=[[ogg]]|help=no}}\n[[Franz Hartmann]] in 1895 satirized [[materialism]] in an allegorical tale entitled ''Unter den Gnomen im Untersberg''. The English translation appeared in 1896 as ''Among the Gnomes: An Occult Tale of Adventure in the Untersberg''. In this story, the ''Gnomes'' are still clearly subterranean creatures, guarding treasures of gold within the [[Untersberg]] mountain.\n\nAs a figure of 19th century [[fairy tale]]s, the term gnome became largely synonymous with other terms for \"[[little people (mythology)|little people]]\" by the 20th century, such as ''[[goblin]]'', ''[[brownie (folklore)|brownie]]'', ''[[kobold]]'', ''[[leprechaun]]'', ''[[Heinzelm\u00e4nnchen]]'' and other instances of the \"[[domestic spirit]]\" type, losing its strict association with earth or the underground world.\n\n==Cultural references==\n===Modern fantasy literature===\n* Creatures called ''gnomes'' have been used in the [[fantasy]] genre of fiction and later gaming since the mid-nineteenth century, typically in a cunning role, e.g. as an inventor.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]] |chapter=Elemental |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |first1=John |last1=Clute |first2=John |last2=Grant |pages=313\u2013314 |date=1999 |isbn=0-312-19869-8}}</ref>\n* In [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[List of Oz books|Oz]] series (created 1900 to 1914), the Nomes (so spelled), especially [[Nome King|their king]], are the chief adversaries of the Oz people. They are ugly, hot-tempered, immortal, round-bodied with spindly legs and arms, have long beards and wild hair, live underground, and are the militant protectors/hoarders of jewels and precious metals. Baum does not depict any female gnomes. [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]], who continued the series (1972 to 1976) after Baum's death, reverted to the traditional spelling.\n** L. Frank Baum also featured the classical gnomes in his book ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]''. They are in charge of watching over the rocks and their king is part of the Council of Immortals. In addition, they also created the sleigh bells for [[Santa Claus]]' [[Santa Claus's reindeer|reindeer]].\n* [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], in the [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]] (created 1914 to 1973) surrounding his [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], uses \"Gnomes\" as the initial and later dropped name of the [[Noldor]], the most gifted and technologically minded of his elvish races, in conscious exploitation of the similarity with the word ''[[:wikt:gnomic|gnomic]]''. ''Gnome'' is thus Tolkien's English loan-translation of the [[Quenya]] word ''Noldo'' (plural ''Noldor''), \"those with knowledge\". Tolkien's \"Gnomes\" are generally tall, beautiful, dark-haired, light-skinned, immortal, and typically wise but suffer from pride, tend towards violence, and have an overweening love of the works of their own hands, particularly gemstones. Many of them live in cities below ground ([[Nargothrond]]) or in secluded mountain fortresses ([[Gondolin]]). He uses \"Gnomes\" to refer to both males and females. In ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]'' (between 1920 and 1942), which Tolkien wrote for his children, Red Gnomes are presented as helpful creatures who come from Norway to the North Pole to assist Father Christmas and his Elves in fighting the wicked Goblins.\n* [[Denys Watkins-Pitchford|BB's]] ''[[The Little Grey Men]]'' (1942) is a story of the last gnomes in England, little wild men who live by hunting and fishing.\n* In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' (created 1950 to 1956), the gnomes are sometimes called \"Earthmen\". live in the [[Underland (Narnia)|Underland]], a series of subterranean caverns. Unlike the traditional, more human-like gnomes, they can have a wide variety of physical features and skin colours. They are used as slaves by the [[Lady of the Green Kirtle]].\n* The Dutch books ''[[Gnomes (book)|Gnomes]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Secret Book of Gnomes]]'' (1984), written by [[Wil Huygen]], deal with gnomes living together in harmony. These same books are the basis for [[Gnomes (film)|a made-for-TV animated film]] and the Spanish-animated series ''[[The World of David the Gnome]]'' (as well as the spin-off ''[[Wisdom of the Gnomes]]''). The word \"gnome\", in this case, is used in place of the Dutch [[kabouter]].\n* In the ''[[Warcraft]]'' franchise (1994 to present), particularly as featured in the [[MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', [[Races and factions of Warcraft#Gnomes|gnomes]] are a race of beings separate from but [[Races and factions of Warcraft#The Alliance|allied]] to dwarves and humans, with whom they share the lands of the Eastern Kingdoms. Crafty, intelligent, and smaller than their dwarven brethren, gnomes are one of two races in Azeroth regarded as technologically savvy. It is suggested in lore that the gnomes originally were mechanical creations that at some point became organic lifeforms. In ''World of Warcraft'', gnomes are an exile race, having irradiated their home city of Gnomeregan in an unsuccessful last-ditch effort to drive out marauding foes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/23/know-your-lore-gnomes-the-inheritors-of-the-future/ |title=Know Your Lore: Gnomes, the inheritors of the future |work=Engadget |last=Rossi |first=Matthew |date=23 April 2014 |accessdate=4 July 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731185111/https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/23/know-your-lore-gnomes-the-inheritors-of-the-future/ |archivedate=31 July 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* In [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series (created 1997 to 2007), gnomes are pests that inhabit the gardens of witches and wizards. They are small creatures with heads that look like potatoes on small stubby bodies. Gnomes are generally considered harmless but mischievous and may bite with sharp teeth. In the books, it is stated that the Weasleys are lenient to gnomes, and tolerate their presence, preferring to throw them out of the garden rather than more extreme measures.\n* In [[Terry Brooks]]' ''[[Shannara]]'' series (created 1977 to 2017), gnomes are an offshoot race created after the Great Wars. There are several distinctive classes of gnomes. Gnomes are the smallest race. In ''[[The Sword of Shannara]]'' they are considered to be tribal and warlike, the one race that can be the most easily subverted to an evil cause. This is evidenced by their allegiance to the Warlock Lord in ''The Sword of Shannara'' and to the Mord Wraiths in ''[[The Wishsong of Shannara]]''.\n\n===Music===\n*\"[[The Laughing Gnome]]\" is a song by English musician [[David Bowie]], released as a single in 1967. It became a hit when reissued in 1973, in the wake of Bowie's commercial success.\n*The 1970 album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' by English musician [[George Harrison]] has a cover image of the musician sitting among a group of garden gnomes.\n*\"[[The Gnome]]\" is a song by [[Pink Floyd]] on their 1967 album ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]''.

The image of the gnome changed further during the 1960s to 1970s, when the first plastic garden gnomes were manufactured. These gnomes followed the style of the 1937 depiction of the seven dwarves in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]. This \"[[Disneyfication|Disneyfied]]\" image of the gnome was built upon by the illustrated children's book classic ''[[The Secret Book of Gnomes]]'' (1976), in the original Dutch ''Leven en werken van de [[Kabouter]]''. Garden gnomes share a resemblance to the Scandinavian [[nisse (folklore)|tomte and nisse]], and the Swedish term \"tomte\" can be translated as \"gnome\" in English.\n\n===Gnome-themed parks===\n[[File:Wieliczka-color.jpg|thumb|Gnome garden at the [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]], Poland|alt=]]\nSeveral gnome themed entertainment parks exist.

It is sometimes called ''white graphite'', due to its similar properties.\n\nWhen a large number of crystallographic defects bind these planes together, graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes what is known as [[pyrolytic graphite]]. It is also highly anisotropic, and [[diamagnetic]], thus it will float in mid-air above a strong magnet. If it is made in a fluidized bed at 1000\u20131300&nbsp;\u00b0C then it is isotropic turbostratic, and is used in blood contacting devices like mechanical heart valves and is called [[pyrolytic carbon]], and is not diamagnetic.

This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and soft, and could easily be cut into sticks. Because of its military importance, this unique mine and its production were strictly controlled by the Crown.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Statutes at Large: From the ...

The British empire controlled most of the world\u2019s production (especially from Ceylon), but production from Austrian, German and American deposits expanded by mid-century.  For example, the Dixon Crucible Company of Jersey City, New Jersey, founded by [[Joseph Dixon (inventor)]] and partner [[Orestes Cleveland]] in 1845, opened mines in the Lake Ticonderoga district of New York, built a processing plant there, and a factory to manufacture pencils, crucibles and other products in New Jersey, described in the ''Engineering & Mining Journal'' 21 December 1878.  The Dixon pencil is still in production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dixonusa.com/history.html|website=Dixon Ticonderoga Company|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe beginnings of the revolutionary [[froth flotation]] process are associated with graphite mining.  Included in the ''E&MJ'' article on the Dixon Crucible Company is a sketch of the \u201cfloating tanks\u201d used in the age-old process of extracting graphite.  Because graphite is so light, the mix of graphite and waste was sent through a final series of water tanks where a cleaner graphite \u201cfloated\u201d off, which left waste to drop out.  In an 1877 patent, the two brothers Bessel (Adolph and August) of Dresden, Germany took this \u201cfloating\u201d process a step further and added a small amount of oil to the tanks and boiled the mix \u2013 an agitation or frothing step \u2013 to collect the graphite, the first steps toward the future flotation process.  Adolph Bessel received the Wohler Medal for the patented process that upgraded the recovery of graphite to 90% from the German deposit.  In 1977, the German Society of Mining Engineers and Metallurgists organized a special symposium dedicated to their discovery and, thus, the 100th anniversary of flotation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nguyen|first1=Ahn|title=Colloidal Science of Flotation|date=2003|isbn=0824747828|pages=11}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, in 1885, Hezekiah Bradford of Philadelphia, patented a similar process, but it is uncertain if his process was used successfully in the nearby graphite deposits of Chester County, Pennsylvania, a major producer by the 1890s.  The Bessel process was limited in use, primarily because of the abundant cleaner deposits found around the globe, which needed not much more than hand-sorting to gather the pure graphite.  The state of the art, ca. 1900, is described in the Canadian Department of Mines report on graphite mines and mining, when Canadian deposits began to become important producers of graphite.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ibid.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cirkel|first1=Fritz|title=Graphite its Properties, Occurrence, Refining and Uses|date=1907|publisher=Canadian Department of Mines|location=Ottawa|page=passim.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQXOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=Bessel+graphite&source=bl&ots=io7ndaRGgV&sig=opqbOEDxHll67EIMRxUNkKqOKak&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFuqHgoabaAhUC_1QKHRraBEgQ6AEITDAH#v=onepage&q=Bessel%20graphite&f=false|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> \n\n=== Other names {{anchor|Plumbago}} ===\nHistorically, graphite was called '''black lead''' or '''plumbago'''.<ref name=Brit/><ref>{{Cite book\n| series = Spons' Workshop Receipts\n| publisher = Spon\n| volume = Vol. II: Dyeing to Japanning\n| title = Electro-Plating on Non-Metallic Substances\n| year = 1921\n| page = 132\n}}</ref> Plumbago was commonly used in its [[crystal habit#Massive|massive]] mineral form. Both of these names arise from confusion with the similar-appearing [[lead]] ores, particularly [[galena]]. The Latin word for lead, ''[[plumbum]]'', gave its name to the English term for this grey metallic-sheened mineral and even to the leadworts or [[plumbago]]s, plants with flowers that resemble this colour.\n\nThe term ''black lead'' usually refers to a powdered or processed graphite, matte black in color.\n\n[[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] coined the name ''graphite'' (\"writing stone\") in 1789. He attempted to clear up the confusion between molybdena, plumbago and black lead after [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] in 1778 proved that there are at least three different minerals. Scheele's analysis showed that the chemical compounds [[molybdenum sulfide]] ([[molybdenite]]), [[lead(II) sulfide]] ([[galena]]) and graphite were three different soft black minerals.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-968X.1908.tb00513.x | title = V.\u2014 the Meanings and Synonyms of Plumbago | year = 1908 | last1 = Evans | first1 = John W. | journal = Transactions of the Philological Society | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 133\u2013179}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author= Widenmann, Johann Friedrich Wilhelm |title= Handbuch des oryktognostischen Theils der Mineralogie: Mit einer Farbentabelle und einer Kupfertafel|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9QxQAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA653|year= 1794|publisher=Crusius|page= 653}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n| author = Scheele, C.

However, the process of separating it from graphite will require more technological development.\n\n===Refractories===\nThe use of graphite as a [[refractory]] material began before 1900 with the graphite [[crucible]] used to hold molten metal; this is now a minor part of [[Refractory|refractories]]. In the mid-1980s, the carbon-[[magnesite]] brick became important, and a bit later the alumina-graphite shape. {{As of | 2017}} the order of importance is: alumina-graphite shapes, carbon-magnesite brick, monolithics (gunning and ramming mixes), and then crucibles.\n\nCrucibles began using very large flake graphite, and carbon-magnesite brick requiring not quite so large flake graphite; for these and others there is now much more flexibility in the size of flake required, and amorphous graphite is no longer restricted to low-end refractories. Alumina-graphite shapes are used as continuous casting ware, such as nozzles and troughs, to convey the molten steel from ladle to mold, and carbon magnesite bricks line steel converters and electric-arc furnaces to withstand extreme temperatures. Graphite blocks are also used in parts of [[blast furnace]] linings where the high thermal conductivity of the graphite is critical. High-purity monolithics are often used as a continuous furnace lining instead of carbon-magnesite bricks.\n\nThe US and European refractories industry had a crisis in 2000\u20132003, with an indifferent market for steel and a declining refractory consumption per [[tonne]] of steel underlying firm buyouts and many plant closures.{{cn|date=January 2017}} Many of the plant closures resulted from the acquisition of Harbison-Walker Refractories by [[RHI AG]] and some plants had their equipment auctioned off. Since much of the lost capacity was for carbon-magnesite brick, graphite consumption within the refractories area moved towards alumina-graphite shapes and monolithics, and away from brick. The major source of carbon-magnesite brick is now imports from China. Almost all of the above refractories are used to make steel and account for 75% of refractory consumption; the rest is used by a variety of industries, such as cement.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]], US natural graphite consumption in refractories comprised 12,500 tonnes in 2010.<ref name=usgs/>\n\n===Batteries===\nThe use of graphite in batteries has increased in the last 30 years. Natural and synthetic graphite are used to construct electrodes in major battery technologies.<ref name=usgs/>{{failed verification|date=October 2018}} The [[lithium-ion battery]] utilizes roughly twice the amount of graphite as lithium carbonate.<ref name=galaxycapital/>\n\nThe demand for batteries, primarily [[Nickel\u2013metal hydride battery| nickel\u2013metal hydride]] and [[lithium-ion batteries]], caused a growth in demand for graphite in the late 1980s and early 1990s - a growth driven by portable electronics, such as portable [[CD player]]s and [[power tool]]s. [[Laptop]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, [[tablet computer | tablet]]s, and smartphone products have increased the demand for batteries. Electric-vehicle batteries are anticipated{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to increase graphite demand. As an example, a lithium-ion battery in a fully-electric [[Nissan Leaf]] contains nearly 40&nbsp;kg of graphite.\n\n===Steelmaking===\nNatural graphite in steelmaking mostly goes into raising the carbon content in molten steel, and can also be used to lubricate the dies used to extrude hot steel. Carbon additives are subject to competitive pricing from alternatives such as synthetic graphite powder, petroleum coke, and other forms of carbon. A carbon raiser is added to increase the carbon content of the steel to the specified level. An estimate based on [[USGS]]'s graphite consumption statistics indicates that 10,500 tonnes were used in this fashion in the US in 2005.<ref name=usgs/>\n\n===Brake linings===\nNatural amorphous and fine flake graphite are used in brake linings or [[brake shoes]] for heavier (nonautomotive) vehicles, and became important with the need to substitute for [[asbestos]]. This use has been important for quite some time, but nonasbestos organic (NAO) compositions are beginning to reduce graphite's market share. A brake-lining industry shake-out with some plant closures has not been beneficial, nor has an indifferent automotive market. According to the [[USGS]], US natural graphite consumption in brake linings was 6,510 tonnes in 2005.<ref name=usgs/>\n\n===Foundry facings and lubricants===\nA foundry facing mold wash is a water-based paint of amorphous or fine flake graphite. Painting the inside of a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled. Graphite [[lubricants]] are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures, as forging die lubricant, an antiseize agent, a gear lubricant for mining machinery, and to lubricate locks. Having low-grit graphite, or even better, no-grit graphite (ultra high purity), is highly desirable. It can be used as a dry powder, in water or oil, or as colloidal graphite (a permanent suspension in a liquid). An estimate based on [[USGS]] graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2,200 tonnes was used in this fashion in 2005.<ref name=usgs/>\n\n===Pencils===\n[[File:Pencils hb.jpg|Graphite pencils|thumb|alt=Graphite pencils]]\nThe ability to leave marks on paper and other objects gave graphite its name, given in 1789 by German mineralogist [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]]. It stems from ''graphein'', meaning ''to write'' or ''draw'' in [[Ancient Greek]].<ref name=\"Brit\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/242042/graphite graphite]. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|graphite}}</ref>\n\nFrom the 16th century, all pencils were made with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by [[Nicolas-Jacques Cont\u00e9]] in 1795.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/whatstuff/print/7942sci4.html | title =Pencils & Pencil Lead | author =Ritter, Steve | publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] | date =October 15, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/kzage/ithistory.html | title =The History of the Pencil | publisher =[[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]}}</ref> It is chemically unrelated to the metal [[lead]], whose ores had a similar appearance, hence the continuation of the name.

Retrieved on 2013-04-15.</ref>\n\n===Expanded graphite===\nExpanded graphite is made by immersing natural flake graphite in a bath of [[chromic acid]], then concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], which forces the crystal lattice planes apart, thus expanding the graphite. The expanded graphite can be used to make graphite foil or used directly as \"hot top\" compound to insulate molten metal in a ladle or red-hot steel ingots and decrease heat loss, or as [[firestop]]s fitted around a [[fire door]] or in sheet metal collars surrounding plastic pipe (during a fire, the graphite expands and chars to resist fire penetration and spread), or to make high-performance gasket material for high-temperature use. After being made into graphite foil, the foil is machined and assembled into the bipolar plates in [[fuel cells]].\nThe foil is made into heat sinks for [[laptop computers]] which keeps them cool while saving weight, and is made into a foil laminate that can be used in valve packings or made into gaskets. Old-style packings are now a minor member of this grouping: fine flake graphite in oils or greases for uses requiring heat resistance.

In these compounds, the host molecule or atom gets \"sandwiched\" between the graphite layers, resulting in a type of compound with variable stoichiometry. A prominent example of an intercalation compound is potassium graphite, denoted by the formula KC<sub>8</sub>. Some graphite intercalation compounds are [[superconductors]]. The highest transition temperature (by June 2009) ''T''<sub>c</sub> = 11.5&nbsp;K is achieved in CaC<sub>6</sub>, and it further increases under applied pressure (15.1&nbsp;K at 8&nbsp;GPa).<ref name=\"cac6\">{{cite journal|pmc=5099629|author1=Emery, Nicolas |author2=H\u00e9rold, Claire |author3=Mar\u00each\u00e9, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois |author4=Lagrange, Philippe |title =Synthesis and superconducting properties of CaC<sub>6</sub>| journal = Sci.

Another process to make synthetic graphite was [[Acheson process|invented]] accidentally by [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]] (1856\u20131931). In the mid-1890s, Acheson discovered that overheating [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]] (silicon carbide or [[Silicon carbide|SiC]]) produced almost pure graphite. While studying the effects of high temperature on carborundum, he had found that [[silicon]] vaporizes at about 4,150&nbsp;\u00b0C (7,500&nbsp;\u00b0F), leaving the carbon behind in graphitic carbon. This graphite was another major discovery for him, and it became extremely valuable and helpful as a lubricant.<ref name=Brit/>\n\nIn 1896, Acheson received a patent for his method of synthesizing graphite,<ref>Acheson, E. G. \"Manufacture of Graphite\", {{US Patent|568323}}, issued September 29, 1896.</ref> and in 1897 started commercial production.<ref name=Brit/> The Acheson Graphite Co. was formed in 1899. \n\n===Scientific research===\n\n[[Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite]] (HOPG) is the highest-quality synthetic form of graphite. It is used in scientific research, in particular, as a length standard for scanner calibration of [[scanning probe microscope]].<ref name=\"automatic1998\">{{cite journal|author=Lapshin, R.

They are made from [[petroleum coke]] after it is mixed with [[coal tar pitch]]. They are then extruded and shaped, baked to [[carbonize]] the [[binder (material)|binder]] (pitch), and finally graphitized by heating it to temperatures approaching 3000&nbsp;\u00b0C, at which the carbon atoms arrange into graphite. They can vary in size up to {{cvt|3.5|m|0}} long and {{cvt|75|cm|0}} in diameter. An increasing proportion of global [[steel]] is made using electric arc furnaces, and the electric arc furnace itself is becoming more efficient, making more steel per tonne of electrode. An estimate based on [[USGS]] data indicates that graphite electrode consumption was 197,000 tonnes in 2005.<ref name=usgs/>\n\nElectrolytic [[aluminium smelting]] also uses graphitic carbon electrodes. On a much smaller scale, synthetic graphite electrodes are used in [[electrical discharge machining]] (EDM), commonly to make [[injection mold]]s for [[plastic]]s.<ref>Hugh O. Pierson \u2013 ''Handbook of Carbon, Graphite, Diamonds and Fullerenes: Processing, Properties and Applications'' \u2013 Noyes Publication  {{ISBN|0-8155-1339-9}}</ref>\n\n===Powder and scrap===\nThe powder is made by heating powdered [[petroleum coke]] above the temperature of graphitization, sometimes with minor modifications. The graphite scrap comes from pieces of unusable electrode material (in the manufacturing stage or after use) and lathe turnings, usually after crushing and sizing. Most synthetic graphite powder goes to carbon raising in steel (competing with natural graphite), with some used in batteries and brake linings. According to the [[USGS]], US synthetic graphite powder and scrap production was 95,000 tonnes in 2001 (latest data).<ref name=usgs/>\n\n===Neutron moderator===\n{{main article|Nuclear graphite}}\nSpecial grades of synthetic graphite, such as Gilsocarbon,<ref name=\"arregui17\">{{cite journal | last1 = Arregui-Mena | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Bodel | first2 = W. | display-authors = etal | year = 2016 | title = Spatial variability in the mechanical properties of Gilsocarbon | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308515387_Spatial_variability_in_the_mechanical_properties_of_Gilsocarbon | journal = Carbon | volume = 110 | issue = | pages = 497\u2013517 | doi = 10.1016/j.carbon.2016.09.051}}</ref><ref name=\"arregui18\">{{cite journal | last1 = Arregui Mena | first1 = J.D. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2018 | title = Characterisation of the spatial variability of material properties of Gilsocarbon and NBG-18 using random fields | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327537624_Characterisation_of_the_spatial_variability_of_material_properties_of_Gilsocarbon_and_NBG-18_using_random_fields | journal = Journal of Nuclear Materials | volume = 511 | issue = | pages = 91-108| doi = 10.1016/j.jnucmat.2018.09.008}}</ref> also find use as a matrix and [[neutron moderator]] within [[nuclear reactor]]s. Its low [[neutron cross-section]] also recommends it for use in proposed [[fusion reactor]]s. Care must be taken that reactor-grade graphite is free of neutron absorbing materials such as [[boron]], widely used as the seed electrode in commercial graphite deposition systems\u2014this caused the failure of the Germans' [[World War II]] graphite-based nuclear reactors. Since they could not isolate the difficulty they were forced to use far more expensive [[heavy water]] moderators. Graphite used for nuclear reactors is often referred to as [[nuclear graphite]].\n\n===Other uses===\n[[carbon (fiber)|Graphite (carbon) fiber]] and [[carbon nanotube]]s are also used in [[carbon fiber reinforced plastic]]s, and in heat-resistant composites such as [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] (RCC). Commercial structures made from carbon fiber graphite composites include [[fishing rod]]s, golf club shafts, bicycle frames, sports car body panels, the fuselage of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] [[cue sticks]] and have been successfully employed in [[reinforced concrete]],  The mechanical properties of carbon fiber graphite-reinforced plastic composites and grey [[cast iron]] are strongly influenced by the role of graphite in these materials. In this context, the term \"(100%) graphite\" is often loosely used to refer to a pure mixture of carbon reinforcement and [[resin]], while the term \"composite\" is used for [[composite materials]] with additional ingredients.<ref>Cooper, Jeff. [http://tennis.about.com/od/tennisracquetsfaq/f/faqracquets42.htm What is the best material for a tennis racquet?]. tennis.about.com</ref>\n\nModern [[smokeless powder]] is coated in graphite to prevent the buildup of [[static charge]].\n\nGraphite has been used in at least three [[radar absorbent material]]s. It was mixed with rubber in Sumpf and Schornsteinfeger, which were used on [[U-boat]] [[Submarine snorkel|snorkels]] to reduce their [[radar cross section]]. It was also used in tiles on early [[F-117 Nighthawk]] stealth strike fighters.\n\nGraphite composites are used as absorber for high-energy particles (e.g. in the LHC beam dump<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdfs/200712/protecting_the_lhc.pdf|title=Protecting the LHC from itself|last=Yurkewicz|first=Katie|date=|website=Symmetry Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>).\n\n==Graphite mining, beneficiation, and milling==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - Museum - Exhibition Nature theatre 08 - Graphite, large stone.jpg|thumb|Large graphite specimen. [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]]]\nGraphite is mined by both [[open-pit mining|open pit]] and underground methods. Graphite usually needs [[beneficiation]]. This may be carried out by hand-picking the pieces of gangue (rock) and hand-screening the product or by crushing the rock and floating out the graphite. Beneficiation by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and \"marks\" (coats) the particles of [[gangue]]. This makes the \"marked\" gangue particles float off with the graphite, yielding impure concentrate. There are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product: repeated regrinding and floating (up to seven times) to purify the concentrate, or by acid leaching (dissolving) the gangue with [[hydrofluoric acid]] (for a silicate gangue) or [[hydrochloric acid]] (for a carbonate gangue).\n \nIn milling, the incoming graphite products and concentrates can be ground before being classified (sized or screened), with the coarser flake size fractions (below 8 mesh, 8\u201320 mesh, 20\u201350 mesh) carefully preserved, and then the carbon contents are determined. Some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions, each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. Custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. If flake size is unimportant, the concentrate can be ground more freely. Typical end products include a fine powder for use as a slurry in [[oil drilling]] and coatings for [[foundry]] molds, carbon raiser in the [[steel]] industry (Synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser). Environmental impacts from graphite mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also [[soil contamination]] from powder spillages leading to [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] contamination of soil.\n\n=== Occupational safety ===\nPeople can be exposed to graphite in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, and eye contact.\n\n====United States====\nThe [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for graphite exposure in the workplace as a time weighted average (TWA) of 15 million particles per cubic foot (1.5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>) over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of TWA 2.5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> respirable dust over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 1250&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>, graphite is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = CDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards \u2013 Graphite (natural)|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0306.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}</ref>\n\n==Graphite recycling==\nThe most common way of recycling graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded, or the electrode (or other) are used all the way down to the electrode holder. A new electrode replaces the old one, but a sizeable piece of the old electrode remains. This is crushed and sized, and the resulting graphite powder is mostly used to raise the carbon content of molten steel. Graphite-containing refractories are sometimes also recycled, but often not because of their graphite: the largest-volume items, such as carbon-magnesite bricks that contain only 15\u201325% graphite, usually contain too little graphite. However, some recycled carbon\u2013magnesite brick is used as the basis for furnace-repair materials, and also crushed carbon\u2013magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners. While crucibles have a high graphite content, the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small.\n\nA high-quality flake graphite product that closely resembles natural flake graphite can be made from steelmaking kish. Kish is a large-volume near-molten waste skimmed from the molten iron feed to a basic oxygen furnace, and consists of a mix of graphite (precipitated out of the supersaturated iron), lime-rich slag, and some iron. The iron is recycled on site, leaving a mixture of graphite and slag. The best recovery process uses hydraulic classification (which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity: graphite is light and settles nearly last) to get a 70% graphite rough concentrate. [[Leaching (chemical science)|Leaching]] this concentrate with [[hydrochloric acid]] gives a 95% graphite product with a flake size ranging from 10 mesh down.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Acheson process]]\n*[[Carbon (fiber)|Carbon fiber]]\n*[[Carbon nanotube]]\n*[[Diamond]]\n*[[Exfoliated graphite nano-platelets]]\n*[[Fullerene]]\n*[[Graphene]]\n*[[Graphite intercalation compound]]\n*[[Intumescent]]\n*[[Lonsdaleite]]\n*[[Nuclear graphite]]\n*[[Passive fire protection]]\n*[[Plumbago drawing]]\n*[[Pyrolytic carbon]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite report|author1=C.Michael Hogan |author2=Marc Papineau |title=[[Phase I Environmental Site Assessment]], Asbury Graphite Mill, 2426\u20132500 Kirkham Street, Oakland, California, Earth Metrics report 10292.001|date= December 18, 1989|display-authors=etal}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Klein, Cornelis  |author2=Cornelius S.

Trudeau is also the creator and executive producer of the [[Amazon Studios]] political comedy series ''[[Alpha House]]''.\n\n==Background and education==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2016}}\nTrudeau was born in New York City, the son of Jean Douglas ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Moore) and Francis Berger Trudeau Jr. He is the great-grandson of Dr. [[Edward Livingston Trudeau]], who created [[Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium]] for the treatment of  [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] at [[Saranac Lake, New York]]. Edward was succeeded by his son Francis and grandson Francis Jr. The latter founded the [[Trudeau Institute]] at Saranac Lake, with which his son Garry retains a connection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trudeauinstitute.org/ |title=The Trudeau Institute Homepage|website=TrudeauInstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-14}}</ref>\n\nAmong his great-great-great-grandfathers were Bishop [[Richard Channing Moore]] (through his father) and the New York politician [[Francis E. Spinner]] (through his mother). Trudeau is also a descendant of \u00c9tienne Truteau (1641\u20131712), first French ancestor of the Trudeaus in America. \nHe has in his ascendant lineage James de Berty Trudeau and [[Gerardus Beekman]], one of the earliest colonial governors of the [[Province of New York]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nHis ancestry is French Canadian, English, Dutch, German, and Swedish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Garry Trudeau ancestry|work=Ancestry.com: Family Tree Maker's Genealogy Site: My Genealogy Home Page|accessdate=2014-12-13|url=http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~addams/other/trudeau.html}}</ref>\n\nRaised in Saranac Lake, Trudeau attended the prestigious and elite [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire]]. He enrolled in [[Yale University]] in 1966. As an art major, Trudeau initially focused on painting, but soon discovered a greater interest in the [[graphic arts]]. He spent much of his time cartooning and writing for Yale's [[humor magazine]] ''[[The Yale Record]]'',<ref>Trudeau, Garry (November 1968). Cover Illustration. ''The Yale Record''. New Haven, CT.</ref> eventually serving as the magazine's editor-in-chief. At the same time, Trudeau began contributing to the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'', which eventually led to the creation of ''Bull Tales'', a comic strip parodying the exploits of Yale quarterback [[Brian Dowling (American football)|Brian Dowling]]. This strip was the progenitor of ''Doonesbury''.<ref name=Rose>{{YouTube|VKC47mTaMoc|Charlie Rose \u2013 Garry Trudeau}}, ''Charlie Rose'' October 11, 2004, uploaded on August 27, 2007 on YouTube</ref>\n\nWhile still an undergraduate at [[Yale]], Trudeau published two collections of ''Bull Tales'': ''Bull Tales'' (1969, published by the ''Yale Daily News'')<ref>Trudeau, Garry (February, 1969). ''Bull Tales''. New Haven: Yale News.</ref> and ''Michael J.'' (1970, published by ''The Yale Record'').<ref>Trudeau, Garry (February, 1970). ''Michael J.'' New Haven: Yale Record.</ref>\n\nAs a senior, Trudeau became a member of [[Scroll and Key]]. He did postgraduate work at the [[Yale School of Art]], earning a master of fine arts degree in graphic design in 1973. It was there that Trudeau first met photographer [[David Levinthal]], with whom he would later collaborate on ''Hitler Moves East'', an influential \"graphic chronicle\" of the German invasion of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"The Met - Hitler Moves East\">{{cite web|title=Untitled|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/271944|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=14 December 2016|language=English}}</ref>\n\n==Creative works==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2016}}\nSoon after ''Bull Tales'' began running in the Yale student newspaper, the strip caught the attention of the newly formed [[Universal Press Syndicate]]. The syndicate's editor, James F. Andrews, recruited Trudeau, changed the strip's name to ''Doonesbury'', and began distributing it following the cartoonist's graduation in 1970. Today ''Doonesbury'' is [[print syndication|syndicated]] to 1,000 daily and Sunday newspapers worldwide and is accessible online in association with ''[[The Washington Post]]''.\n\nIn 1975, Trudeau became the first comic strip artist to win a [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]], traditionally awarded to editorial-page cartoonists. He was also a Pulitzer finalist in 1990, 2004, and 2005. Other awards include the [[National Cartoonist Society]] Newspaper Comic Strip Award in 1994, and the [[Reuben Award]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jarvis|first1=Zeke|title=Make 'em Laugh!

He was nominated for an Oscar in 1977 in the category of Animated Short Film for ''A Doonesbury Special'', created for NBC in collaboration with [[John Hubley|John]] and [[Faith Hubley]]. The film went on to win the [[Cannes Film Festival]] Jury Special Prize in 1978. In 1984, with composer [[Elizabeth Swados]], he wrote the book and lyrics for the Broadway musical ''[[Doonesbury]]'', for which he was nominated for two [[Drama Desk Award]]s. A cast album of the show, recorded for MCA, received a Grammy nomination. Trudeau again collaborated with Swados in 1984, this time on ''Rap Master Ronnie'', a satirical review about the Reagan Administration that opened off-Broadway at the [[Village Gate]]. A filmed version, featuring [[Jon Cryer]], the [[Smothers Brothers]], and [[Carol Kane]], was broadcast on Cinemax in 1988.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nAlso in 1988, Trudeau wrote and co-produced with director [[Robert Altman]] [[Home Box Office|HBO]]'s critically acclaimed ''[[Tanner '88]]'', a satiric look at that year's presidential election campaign. The show won the gold medal for Best Television Series at the Cannes Television Festival, the [[British Academy Television Award]] for Best Foreign Program, and Best Imported Program from the British [[Broadcasting Press Guild]]. It earned an [[Emmy Award]], as well as four [[ACE Award]] nominations.

The earliest types of guild  formed as a [[confraternity|confraternities]] of tradesmen. They were organized in a manner something between a [[professional association]], a [[trade union]], a [[cartel]], and a [[secret society]].  They often depended on grants of [[letters patent]] from a [[monarch]] or other authority to enforce the flow of trade to their self-employed members, and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of materials. A lasting legacy of traditional guilds are the [[wikt:guildhall|guildhalls]] constructed and used as guild meeting-places. Guild members found guilty of cheating on the public would be fined or banned from the guild. \n\n[[File:Windsorguildhall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|One of the legacies of the guilds: the elevated [[Windsor Guildhall]] originated as a meeting place for guilds, as well as a magistrates' seat and [[town hall]].]]\n\nAn important result of the guild framework was the emergence of [[University|universities]] at [[University of Bologna|Bologna]] (established in 1088), [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (at least since 1096) and [[University of Paris|Paris]] (c. 1150); they originated as guilds of students (as at Bologna) or of masters (as at Paris).<ref>\n{{cite book\n |first= Hastings |last= Rashdall\n |title= The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages: Salerno.

In the 15th century, Hamburg had 100 guilds, Cologne 80, and L\u00fcbeck 70.<ref>{{cite book |author=Centre international de synthese |title=L'Encyclopedie et les encyclopedistes |publisher=B. Franklin |year=1971 |isbn=0-8337-1157-1 |page=366 }}</ref> The latest guilds to develop in Western Europe were the ''{{lang|es|gremios}}'' of Spain: e.g., Valencia (1332) or Toledo (1426).\n\nNot all city economies were controlled by guilds; some cities were \"free.\" Where guilds were in control, they shaped labor, production and trade; they had strong controls over [[instructional capital]], and the modern concepts of a lifetime progression of [[apprentice]] to [[artisan|craftsman]], and then from [[journeyman]] eventually to widely recognized [[master craftsman|master]] and grandmaster began to emerge. In order to become a master, a journeyman would have to go on a three-year voyage called [[journeyman years]]. The practice of the journeyman years still exists in Germany and France.\n\nAs production became more specialized, trade guilds were divided and subdivided, eliciting the squabbles over jurisdiction that produced the paperwork by which economic historians trace their development: The metalworking guilds of Nuremberg were divided among dozens of independent trades in the boom economy of the 13th century, and there were 101 trades in Paris by 1260.<ref>{{harvnb|Braudel|1992}}</ref> In [[Ghent]], as in [[Florence]], the [[Wool#History|woolen textile industry]] developed as a congeries of specialized guilds. The appearance of the European guilds was tied to the emergent [[money]] economy, and to [[urbanization]]. Before this time it was not possible to run a money-driven organization, as [[commodity money]] was the normal way of doing business.\n[[File:Guildhall. Engraved by E.Shirt after a drawing by Prattent. c.1805..jpg|thumb|right|A center of urban government: the [[Guildhall, London]] (engraving, ca 1805)]]\n\nThe guild was at the center of [[Europe]]an handicraft organization into the 16th century. In France, a resurgence of the guilds in the second half of the 17th century is symptomatic of the monarchy's concerns to impose unity, control production and reap the benefits of transparent structure in the shape of more efficient taxation.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe guilds were identified with organizations enjoying certain privileges ([[letters patent]]), usually issued by the [[monarch|king]] or [[state (polity)|state]] and overseen by local town business authorities (some kind of [[chamber of commerce]]). These were the predecessors of the modern [[patent]] and [[trademark]] system. The guilds also maintained funds in order to support infirm or elderly members, as well as widows and orphans of guild members, funeral benefits, and a 'tramping' allowance for those needing to travel to find work. As the guild system of the [[City of London]] declined during the 17th century, the [[Livery Companies]] transformed into mutual assistance fraternities along such lines.\n\nEuropean guilds imposed long standardized periods of [[apprenticeship]], and made it difficult for those lacking the capital to set up for themselves or without the approval of their peers to gain access to materials or knowledge, or to sell into certain markets, an area that equally dominated the guilds' concerns. These are defining characteristics of [[mercantilism]] in economics, which dominated most European thinking about [[political economy]] until the rise of [[classical economics]].\n\nThe guild system survived the emergence of early [[Capitalism|capitalists]], which began to divide guild members into \"haves\" and dependent \"have-nots\".  The civil struggles that characterize the 14th-century towns and cities were struggles in part between the greater guilds and the lesser artisanal guilds, which depended on [[piecework]]. \"In Florence, they were openly distinguished: the ''Arti maggiori'' and the ''Arti minori''&mdash;already there was a ''[[popolo grasso]]'' and a ''[[popolo magro]]''\".<ref>{{harvnb|Braudel|1992|p=316}}</ref> Fiercer struggles were those between essentially conservative guilds and the [[merchant]] class, which increasingly came to control the means of production and the capital that could be ventured in expansive schemes, often under the rules of guilds of their own. German social historians trace the ''Zunftrevolution'', the urban revolution of guildmembers against a controlling urban patriciate, sometimes reading into them, however, perceived foretastes of the class struggles of the 19th century.\n[[File:Mendel I 072 v.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Locksmith]], 1451]]\n\nIn the countryside, where guild rules did not operate, there was freedom for the entrepreneur with capital to organize [[cottage industry]], a network of cottagers who spun and wove in their own premises on his account, provided with their raw materials, perhaps even their looms, by the capitalist who took a share of the profits. Such a dispersed system could not so easily be controlled where there was a vigorous local market for the raw materials: wool was easily available in sheep-rearing regions, whereas silk was not.\n\n==== Organization ====\nIn Florence, Italy, there were seven to twelve \"greater guilds\" and fourteen \"lesser guilds\" the most important of the greater guilds was that for judges and notaries, who handled the legal business of all the other guilds and often served as an arbitrator of disputes. Other greater guilds include the wool, silk, and the money changers' guilds. They prided themselves on a reputation for very high-quality work, which was rewarded with premium prices. The guilds fined members who deviated from standards. Other greater guilds included those of doctors, druggists, and furriers. Among the lesser guilds, were those for bakers, saddle makers, ironworkers and other artisans. They had a sizable membership, but lacked the political and social standing necessary to influence city affairs.<ref>{{cite book |first=Frank N. |last=Magill |title=Great Events from History: Ancient and Medieval Series: 951\u20131500 |publisher=Salem |volume=3 |year=1972 |isbn= |pages=1303\u20137 |url=}}</ref>\n\nThe guild was made up by experienced and confirmed experts in their field of handicraft. They were called [[master craftsman|master craftsmen]]. Before a new employee could rise to the level of mastery, he had to go through a schooling period during which he was first called an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]]. After this period he could rise to the level of [[journeyman]].  Apprentices would typically not learn more than the most basic techniques until they were trusted by their peers to keep the guild's or company's secrets.\n\nLike ''journey'', the distance that could be travelled in a day, the title 'journeyman'  derives from the French words for 'day' (''jour'' and ''journ\u00e9e'') from which came the middle English word ''journei''. Journeymen were able to work for other masters, unlike apprentices, and generally paid by the day and were thus day labourers. After being employed by a master for several years, and after producing a qualifying piece of work, the apprentice was granted the rank of journeyman and was given documents (letters or certificates from his master and/or the guild itself) which certified him as a journeyman and entitled him to travel to other towns and countries to learn the art from other masters. These journeys could span large parts of Europe and were an unofficial way of communicating new methods and techniques, though by no means all journeymen made such travels \u2014 they were most common in Germany and Italy, and in other countries journeymen from small cities would often visit the capital.<ref name=Ogilvie11>{{harvnb|Ogilvie|2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|right|upright=1.05|thumb|''[[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke|The Haarlem Painter's Guild]]'' in 1675, by  [[Jan de Bray]].]]\nAfter this journey and several years of experience, a journeyman could be received as master craftsman, though in some guilds this step could be made straight from apprentice. This would typically require the approval of all masters of a guild, a donation of money and other goods (often omitted for sons of existing members), and the production of a so-called \"[[masterpiece]],' which would illustrate the abilities of the aspiring master craftsman; this was often retained by the guild.<ref>{{harvnb|Prak|2006}}</ref>\n\nThe medieval guild was established by charters or letters patent or similar authority by the city or the ruler and normally held a monopoly on trade in its craft within the city in which it operated: handicraft workers were forbidden by law to run any business if they were not members of a guild, and only masters were allowed to be members of a guild. Before these privileges were legislated, these groups of handicraft workers were simply called 'handicraft associations'.\n\nThe town authorities might be represented in the guild meetings and thus had a means of controlling the handicraft activities.  This was important since towns very often depended on a good reputation for export of a narrow range of products, on which not only the guild's, but the town's, reputation depended. Controls on the association of physical locations to well-known exported products, e.g. wine from the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[Bordeaux]] regions of [[France]], tin-glazed earthenwares from certain cities in [[Holland]], [[lace]] from [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], etc., helped to establish a town's place in global commerce \u2014 this led to modern [[trademark]]s.\n\nIn many German and Italian cities, the more powerful guilds often had considerable political influence, and sometimes attempted to control the city authorities. In the 14th century, this led to numerous bloody uprisings, during which the guilds dissolved town councils and detained [[patricianship|patricians]] in an attempt to increase their influence. In fourteenth-century north-east Germany, people of [[Wends|Wend]]ish, i.e. [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], origin were not allowed to join some guilds.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=The Situation with the Sorbs in the Past and Present|date=|work=|publisher=|url=http://www.ifl-leipzig.com/fileadmin/daten/downloads/DOWNLOADCENTER/Publikationen/internationale%20Zusammenfassungen%20Europa%20Regional/2002/Heft2/en.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713003632/http://www.ifl-leipzig.com/fileadmin/daten/downloads/DOWNLOADCENTER/Publikationen/internationale%20Zusammenfassungen%20Europa%20Regional/2002/Heft2/en.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-13|df=}}</ref> According to Wilhelm Raabe, ''\"down into the eighteenth century no German guild accepted a Wend.\"''<ref>Raabe, p. 189.</ref>\n\n==== Fall of the guilds ====\n[[File:Tinguild.jpg|thumb|right|An example of the last of the British Guilds meeting rooms {{circa|1820}}]]\nAs [[Sheilagh Ogilvie|Ogilvie]] (2004) shows, the guilds negatively affected quality, skills, and innovation. Through what economists now call \"[[rent-seeking]]\" they imposed deadweight losses on the economy. Ogilvie says they generated no demonstrable positive externalities and notes that industry began to flourish only after the guilds faded away. Guilds persisted over the centuries because they redistributed resources to politically powerful merchants. On the other hand, Ogilvie agrees, guilds created \"social capital\" of shared norms, common information, mutual sanctions, and collective political action. This social capital benefited guild members, even as it hurt outsiders.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sheilagh |last=Ogilvie |title=Guilds, efficiency, and social capital: evidence from German proto-industry |journal=Economic History Review |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=286\u2013333 |date=May 2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2004.00279.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0289.2004.00279.x/abstract}}</ref>\n\nThe guild system became a target of much criticism towards the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. They were believed to oppose [[free trade]] and hinder [[technological innovation]], [[technology transfer]] and [[business development]].  According to several accounts of this time, guilds became increasingly involved in simple territorial struggles against each other and against free practitioners of their arts.\n\nTwo of the most outspoken critics of the guild system were [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Adam Smith]], and all over Europe a tendency to oppose government control over trades in favour of [[laissez-faire]] [[free market]] systems was growing rapidly and making its way into the political and legal system. The French Revolution saw guilds as a last remnant of [[feudalism]].  The [[Le Chapelier Law]] of 1791 abolished the guilds in France.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Liana |last=Vardi |title=The abolition of the guilds during the French Revolution |journal=French Historical Studies |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=704\u2013717 |year=1988 |jstor=286554}}</ref>  Smith wrote in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (Book I, Chapter X, paragraph 72):\n\n{{quote|It is to prevent this reduction of price, and consequently of wages and profit, by restraining that free competition which would most certainly occasion it, that all corporations, and the greater part of corporation laws, have been established. (...) and when any particular class of artificers or traders thought proper to act as a corporation without a charter, such adulterine guilds, as they were called, were not always disfranchised upon that account, but obliged to fine annually to the king for permission to exercise their usurped privileges.}}\n\n[[Karl Marx]] in his ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'' also criticized the guild system for its rigid gradation of social rank and the relation of oppressor/oppressed entailed by this system. From this time comes the low regard in which some people hold the guilds to this day. In part due to their own inability to control unruly [[corporation|corporate]] behavior, the tide turned against the guilds.\n\nBecause of industrialization and modernization of the trade and industry, and the rise of powerful nation-states that could directly issue [[patent]] and [[copyright]] protections &mdash; often revealing the [[trade secret]]s &mdash; the guilds' power faded. After the [[French Revolution]] they fell in most European nations through the 19th century, as the guild system was disbanded and replaced by free trade laws. By that time, many former handicraft workers had been forced to seek employment in the emerging manufacturing industries, using not closely guarded techniques but standardized methods controlled by [[corporation]]s.\n\n==== Influence of guilds ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}\n[[File:Shoemaker Book of Trades.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Shoemaker]]s, 1568]]\nGuilds are sometimes said to be the precursors of modern [[trade union]]s.  Guilds, however, can also be seen as a set of self-employed skilled craftsmen with ownership and control over the materials and tools they needed to produce their goods. Guilds were more like [[cartels]] than they were like trade unions (Olson 1982). However, the journeymen organizations, which were at the time illegal,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bakliwal|first1=V.K.|title=Production and Operation Management|date=March 18, 2011|publisher=Pinnacle Technology, 2011|isbn=9788189472733}}</ref> may have been influential.\n\nThe exclusive privilege of a guild to produce certain goods or provide certain services was similar in spirit and character with the original [[patent]] systems that surfaced in England in 1624.  These systems played a role in ending the guilds' dominance, as [[trade secret]] methods were superseded by modern firms directly revealing their techniques, and counting on the state to enforce their legal [[monopoly]].\n\nSome guild traditions still remain in a few handicrafts, in Europe especially among [[shoemaker]]s and [[barber]]s.  Some [[ritual]] traditions of the guilds were conserved in [[order (religious)|order]] organisations such as the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], allegedly deriving from the Masons Guild, and the [[Oddfellows]], allegedly derived from various smaller guilds.  These are, however, not very important economically except as reminders of the responsibilities of some trades toward the public.\n\nModern [[antitrust]] law could be said to derive in some ways from the original statutes by which the guilds were abolished in Europe.\n\n==== Economic consequences ====\nThe economic consequences of guilds have led to heated debates among economic historians. On the one side, scholars say that since merchant guilds persisted over long periods they must have been efficient institutions (since inefficient institutions die out). Others say they persisted not because they benefited the entire economy but because they benefited the owners, who used political power to protect them. Ogilvie (2011) says they regulated trade for their own benefit, were monopolies, distorted markets, fixed prices, and restricted entrance into the guild.<ref name=Ogilvie11/> Ogilvie (2008) argues that their long apprenticeships were unnecessary to acquire skills, and their conservatism reduced the rate of innovation and made the society poorer. She says their main goal was [[rent seeking]], that is, to shift money to the membership at the expense of the entire economy.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sheilagh C. |last=Ogilvie |title=Rehabilitating the Guilds: A Reply |journal=Economic History Review |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=175\u2013182 |date=February 2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00417.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00417.x/abstract}}</ref>\n\nEpstein and Prak's book (2008) rejects Ogilvie's conclusions.<ref>{{harvnb|Epstein|Prak|2008}}</ref> Specifically, Epstein argues that guilds were cost-sharing rather than rent-seeking institutions.

Even if a woman entered a guild, she was excluded from guild offices. It's important to note that while this was the overarching practice, there were guilds and professions that did allow women's participation, and that the Medieval era was an ever-changing, mutable society\u2014especially considering that it spanned hundreds of years and many different cultures. There were multiple accounts of women's participation in guilds in England and the Continent. In a study of London silkwomen of the 15th century by Marian K. Dale, she notes that medieval women could inherit property, belong to guilds, manage estates, and run the family business if widowed. The ''Livre des m\u00e9tiers de Paris (Book of Trades of Paris)'' was compiled by [[\u00c9tienne Boileau]], the Grand Provost of Paris under King [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]]. It documents that 5 out of 110 Parisian guilds were female monopolies, and that only a few guilds systematically excluded women. Boileau notes that some professions were also open to women: surgeons, glass-blowers, chain-mail forgers. Entertainment guilds also had a significant number of women members. [[John, Duke of Berry]] documents payments to female musicians from Le Puy, Lyons, and Paris.<ref name=\"guildswomen\" />\n\nWomen did have problems with entering healers' guilds, as opposed to their relative freedom in trade or craft guilds. Their status in healers' guilds were often challenged. The idea that medicine should only be practice by men was supported by the [[Catholic Church]], royal heads, and secular authorities at the time. It is believed that the Inquisition and witch hunts throughout the ages contributed to the lack of women in medical guilds.<ref name=\"guildswomen\">\"GUILDS, WOMEN IN\" in \"Women in the Middle Ages\", Greenwood Press 2004, pp. 384-85</ref>\n\n== Modern ==\nScholars from the [[history of ideas]] have noticed that [[consultant]]s play a part similar to that of the journeymen of the guild systems: they often travel a lot, work at many companies and spread new practices and knowledge between companies and corporations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[Profession]]al organizations replicate guild structure and operation.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last                  = Sarfatti Larson\n| first                 = Magali\n| title                 = The Rise of Professionalism: A Sociological Analysis\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=N4Ik8Xsrjx0C\n| series                = Campus\n| volume                = 233\n| year                  = 1979 \n| publisher             = University of California Press\n| location              = Berkeley\n| isbn                  = 9780520039506\n| page                  = 15\n| quote                 = [...] a cognitive basis of any kind had to be at least approximately defined before the rising modern professions could negotiate ''cognitive exclusiveness'' \u2014 that is, before they could convincingly establish a teaching monopoly on their specific tools and techniques, while claiming absolute superiority for them. The proved institutional mechanisms for this negotiation were the license, the qualifying examination, the diploma, and formal training in a common curriculum. The typical institutions that administered these devices were, first, the guild-like professional association, and later the professional school, which superseded the association in effectiveness. [...] Obviously, none of this was in itself an organizational invention. The guilds of merchants that sprang up in eleventh-century Europe were also voluntary associations tending towards the monopolistic control of a ''new'' form of trade.[...]\n}}\n</ref>\nProfessions such as architecture, engineering, geology, and land surveying require varying lengths of apprenticeships before one can gain a \"professional\" certification. These certifications hold great legal weight: most states make them a prerequisite to practicing there.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[Thomas W. Malone]] champions a modern variant of the guild structure for modern \"e-lancers\", professionals who do mostly [[telework]] for multiple employers.  [[Insurance]] including any professional [[legal liability|liability]], [[intellectual capital]] protections, an [[ethical code]] perhaps enforced by peer pressure and software, and other benefits of a strong association of producers of knowledge, benefit from [[economies of scale]], and may prevent cut-throat competition that leads to inferior services undercutting prices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  And, as with historical guilds, such a structure will resist foreign competition. The [[free software community]] has from time to time explored a guild-like structure to unite against competition from [[Microsoft]], e.g. [[Advogato]] assigns journeyer and master ranks to those committing to work only or mostly on free software.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n=== Europe ===\nIn many European countries guilds have experienced a revival as local organizations for craftsmen, primarily in traditional skills.  They may function as forums for developing competence and are often the local units of a national employer's organisation.\n\nIn the [[City of London]], the ancient guilds survive as [[livery company|livery companies]], all of which play a ceremonial role in the City's many customs. The City of London livery companies maintain strong links with their respective trade, craft or profession, some still retain regulatory, inspection or enforcement roles. The senior members of the City of London Livery Companies (known as liverymen) elect the sheriffs and approve the candidates for the office of Lord Mayor of London. Guilds also survive in many other towns and cities the UK including in [[Preston, Lancashire]], as the [[Preston Guild Merchant]] where among other celebrations descendants of burgesses are still admitted into membership. With the City of London livery companies, the UK has over 300 extant guilds and growing.\n\nIn 1878 the London livery companies established the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] the forerunner of the engineering school (still called City and Guilds College) at [[Imperial College London]].  The aim of the City and Guilds of London Institute was the advancement of technical education. {{As of|2013}} \"City and Guilds\" operates as an examining and accreditation body for vocational, managerial and engineering qualifications from entry-level craft and trade skills up to post-doctoral achievement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityandguilds.com/about-us/what-we-do|title=What We Do \u2013 vocational qualifications {{!}} City & Guilds|website=www.cityandguilds.com|access-date=2016-10-11}}</ref> A separate organisation, the [[City and Guilds of London Art School]] has also close ties with the London livery companies and is involved in the training of master craftworkers in stone and wood carving, as well as fine artists.\n\nIn [[Germany]] there are no longer any ''Z\u00fcnfte'' (or ''Gilden'' \u2013 the terms used were rather different from town to town), nor any restriction of a craft to a privileged corporation. However, under one other of their old names albeit a less frequent one, ''Innungen'', guilds continue to exist as private member clubs with membership limited to practitioners of particular trades or activities. These clubs are corporations under public law, albeit the membership is voluntary; the president normally comes from the ranks of master-craftsmen and is called ''Obermeister'' (\"master-in-chief\"). Journeymen elect their own representative bodies, with their president having the traditional title of ''Altgesell'' (senior journeyman).\n\nThere are also \"craft chambers\" (''Handwerkskammern''), which have less resemblance to ancient guilds in that they are organized for all crafts in a certain region, not just one. In them membership is mandatory, and they serve to establish self-governance of the crafts.\n\n=== North America ===\nIn the [[United States]] guilds exist in several fields.\n\nIn the film and television industry, guild membership is generally a prerequisite for working on major productions in certain capacities. The [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[Directors Guild of America]], [[Writers Guild of America, East]], [[Writers Guild of America, West]] and other profession-specific guilds have the ability to exercise strong control in the [[cinema of the United States]] as a result of a rigid system of [[intellectual-property]] rights and a history of power-brokers also holding guild membership (e.g., [[DreamWorks]] founder [[Steven Spielberg]] was, and is, a DGA member).  These guilds maintain their own contracts with production companies to ensure a certain number of their members are hired for roles in each film or television production, and that their members are paid a minimum of guild \"scale,\" along with other labor protections.  These guilds set high standards for membership, and exclude professional actors, writers, etc. who do not abide by the strict rules for competing within the film and television industry in America.\n\n[[The Newspaper Guild]] is a [[labor union]] for journalists and other newspaper workers, with over 30,000 members in North America.\n\nReal-estate brokerage offers an example of a modern American guild system. Signs of guild behavior in real-estate brokerage include: standard pricing (6% of the home price), strong affiliation among all practitioners, self-regulation (see [[National Association of Realtors]]), strong cultural identity (see [[realtor]]), little price variation with quality differences, and traditional methods in use by all practitioners. In September 2005 the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors, challenging NAR practices that (the DOJ asserted) prevent competition from practitioners who use different methods. The DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission in 2005 advocated against state laws, supported by NAR, that disadvantage new kinds of brokers.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/nar.htm |title=U.S. v.

Sept. 7, 2005).\n\nThe practice of law in the United States also exemplifies modern guilds at work.  Every state maintains its own [[bar association]], supervised by that state's highest court.  The court decides the criteria for entering and staying in the legal profession.  In most states, every attorney must become a member of that state's bar association in order to practice law.  State laws forbid any person from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law and practicing attorneys are subject to rules of professional conduct that are enforced by the state's high court.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nMedical associations comparable to guilds include the state Medical Boards, the [[American Medical Association]], and the [[American Dental Association]]. Medical licensing in most states requires specific training, tests and years of low-paid apprenticeship (internship and residency) under harsh working conditions. Even qualified international or out-of-state doctors may not practice without acceptance by the local medical guild (Medical board). Similarly, nurses and physicians' practitioners have their own guilds.

by [[Konami]], originally released as a coin-operated [[arcade game]] in {{vgy|1985}}. It was the first game in the [[Gradius|''Gradius'' series]] of shoot 'em ups. In ''Gradius'', the player maneuvers a spacecraft known as the Vic Viper that must defend itself from the various alien enemies. The game features a power-up system called the \"power meter\", based upon collecting capsules to 'purchase' additional weapons.\n\nThe arcade version of ''Gradius'' was released internationally outside Japan under the title of '''''Nemesis''''', although later releases kept the original title. Home versions were released for various platforms, such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/NES]], the [[MSX]] home computer, and the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]], among other formats. The original arcade game and some of the home versions has also been included in various compilation releases and are available for download in services such as the [[Virtual Console]] and [[PlayStation Network]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:gradius 04.png|thumb|left|In ''Gradius'', the player takes control of the Vic Viper, a trans-dimensional spaceship, and must defend it against waves of enemies. Here, the player battles their way through stage three.]]\n\nThe player controls the trans-dimensional [[Spacecraft|spaceship]] [[Vic Viper]], and must battle waves of enemies through various environments. The game became synonymous with the phrase, \"Destroy the core!\", as the standard of boss battles in the ''Gradius'' series involved combat with a giant craft, in the center of which would be situated one to several blue colored spheres. These bosses would be designed in such a way that there would be a straight passage from the exterior of the giant craft which leads directly to one of these cores. The player must fire shots into this passage while avoiding attack patterns from weapon emplacements on the body of the boss. However, small but destructible walls are situated in this passage, impeding the bullet shots from damaging the core, and must be whittled away by repeated well-placed shots. In a way, these tiny walls represent the boss' shielding gauge until its core is finally vulnerable to attack. Some bosses have the ability to regenerate these walls. When the core has sustained enough hits, it usually changes color from blue to red, indicating that it is in critical condition and its destruction is imminent. Upon the destruction of a core, a piece of the boss may be put out of commission, seeing that it is no longer powered by a core, or if all of the cores are destroyed, the entire boss is defeated and explodes satisfyingly. Note that these cores are not present on the more organic bosses of ''Gradius''. Such bosses have weak spots in places such as a mouth, head or eye.\n\nWhen [[gameplay]] begins, the Vic Viper is relatively slow and has only a weak gun. This level of capability is generally insufficient for engaging enemies, but the Vic Viper can gain greater capabilities by collecting and using [[power-up]] items. While most arcade games utilize distinct power up-items that each correspond to a specific effect on the [[player character]], ''Gradius'' has a single power-up item. The effect of this power-up item is to advance the currently selected item in a power-up menu that appears at the bottom of the screen. When the desired power-up is highlighted, the player can obtain it by pressing the power-up button, returning the menu to its initial state in which no power-up is highlighted.\n\n===Release===\nPorts of ''Gradius'' were also done for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[MSX]], [[NEC PC-8801]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/NES]], [[PC Engine]], [[Virtual Console]], [[Sharp X1]], [[Sharp X68000]], [[Mobile phone]]s, [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation]] and [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]]. The game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind ''[[Feud (video game)|Feud]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} It was also released on [[Windows Store]]<ref name=Windows /> on December 20, 2013, GameNow in May 2014 and for PlayStation 4's [[Arcade Archives]] on January 25 in Japan. The NES version of ''Gradius'' introduced a cheat code that would later become known as the [[Konami Code]], as it would be used in numerous future Konami games. In this game, inputting the code while pausing the game would grant the player's ship multiple power-ups instantly.\n\n''Gradius'' was also converted for the [[Nintendo Vs. Series]] arcade platform. It is identical to the NES version, but includes no cheat codes and allows the player to continue indefinitely. The arcade version of ''Gradius'' is included in the ''[[Gradius Collection]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]] and in ''[[Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]]. A version for the [[Game Boy]] was also released in 1990 under the European name ''Nemesis''. It is the first portable game in the Gradius series and contains five levels which play similarly to previous Gradius games. Players select the stage and the number of available extra lives at the start. The game was later included in the compilation ''Konami GB Collection Vol. 1'', where it is titled ''Gradius''.{{cn|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Development==\n''Gradius'' began development when series creator Hiroyasu Machiguchi was given a team to work with and asked everyone what kind of game they wanted to develop, to which they responded being a [[shoot 'em up]], with the intent of surpassing [[Namco|Namco's]] ''[[Xevious]]''.<ref name=\"GameHiyou\">Game Hiyou 9/99</ref> They decided to make it a horizontal shooting game because they wanted to reuse material from ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' as much as possible, and ''Gradius'' was originally named ''Scramble 2''.<ref name=GameHiyou/> The development lasted for a year after refining and experimenting with the gameplay. The team originally tried twenty different movement patterns for the Options and used a process of elimination when something did not work.<ref name=GameHiyou/> For the story, Hiroyasu's team was inspired by science fiction movies, with the popular sci-fi films at the time being ''[[Star Wars]]'' and the anime adaptations of ''[[Lensman]]''. The team saw ''Lensman'' together and it influenced the game's story.

The act performed by a gamemaster is sometimes referred to as \"Gamemastering\" or simply \"GM-ing\".\n\nThe role of a gamemaster in a traditional table-top role-playing game (pencil-and-paper role-playing game) is to weave the other participants' [[player-character]] stories together, control the non-player aspects of the game, create environments in which the players can interact, and solve any player disputes. The basic role of the gamemaster is the same in almost all traditional role-playing games, although differing rule sets make the specific duties of the gamemaster unique to that system.\n\nThe role of a gamemaster in an [[online game]] is to enforce the game's rules and provide general customer service. Also, unlike gamemasters in traditional role-playing games, gamemasters for online games in some cases are paid employees.\n\n==History and variants of the term==\nThe term ''gamemaster'' and the role associated with it could be found in the [[play-by-mail game|postal gaming]] hobby. In typical play-by-mail games, players control armies or civilizations and mail their chosen actions to the GM. The GM then mails the updated game state to all players on a regular basis. Usage in a wargaming context includes [[Guidon Games]] 1973 ruleset, ''[[Ironclad (game)|Ironclad]]''.<ref>{{cite book | title= Ironclad: Civil War Naval Rules |last1= Wham |first1= Tom |authorlink1= Tom Wham |last2= Lowry |first2= Don |authorlink2= Don Lowry | year=1973 | page=i | publisher=[[Guidon Games]] | location=[[Belfast, Maine]]}}</ref> \n\nIn a role-playing game context, it was first used by Dave Arneson while developing his game ''[[Blackmoor (campaign setting)|Blackmoor]]'' in 1971,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kushner|first1=David|title=Dungeon Master: The Life and Legacy of Gary Gygax|url=https://archive.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/news/2008/03/ff_gygax?currentPage=3|website=wired.com|publisher=Wired Magazine|accessdate=March 10, 2008}}</ref> although the first usage in print may have been ''[[Chivalry & Sorcery]]''.<ref name=tresca2010>{{citation | first1=Michael J. | last1=Tresca | title=The Evolution of Fantasy Role-Playing Games | publisher=McFarland | year=2010 | isbn=078645895X | page=63 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8H8bzqj6S4sC&pg=PA63 }}</ref> \n\nEach gaming system has its own name for the role of the gamemaster, such as \"judge\", \"narrator\", \"referee\", \"director\", or \"storyteller\",<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=Mark|title=Fantasy Imperium|date=2006|publisher=Shadowstar Games, Inc.|location=San Diego, CA 92116|isbn=1-933888-00-8|page=2}}</ref> and these terms not only describe the role of the gamemaster in general but also help define how the game is intended to be run. For example, the [[Storyteller System]] used in [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf Game Studio]]'s [[storytelling game]]s calls its GM the \"storyteller\", while the [[Role-playing game system|rules]]- and [[Marvel Universe|setting]]-focused [[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|''Marvel Super Heroes'' role-playing game]] calls its GM the \"judge\". The cartoon inspired role-playing game ''[[Toon (role-playing game)|Toon]]'' calls its GM the \"animator\". A few games apply system- or setting-specific flavorful names to the GM, such as the Keeper of Arcane Lore (in ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'');<ref>{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Sandy|last2=Willis|first2=Lynn|title=Call of Cthulhu, Horror Roleplaying in the Worlds of H.P.

The gamemaster also keeps track of [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) and [[random encounter]]s, as well as of the general state of the game world. The game session (or \"[[adventure (role-playing games)|adventure]]\") can be metaphorically described as a [[Play (theatre)|play]], in which the players are the lead [[actor]]s, and the GM provides the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], the [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], the basic [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] on which the [[improvisation]]al script is built, as well as all the [[bit part]]s and [[supporting character]]s. Gamemasters can also be in charge of RPG board games making the events and setting challenges.\n\nGMs may choose to run a game based on a [[campaign setting|published game world]], with the maps and history already in place; such game worlds often have pre-written adventures. Alternatively, the GM may [[Conworld|build their own world]] and script their own [[Adventure (role-playing games)|adventures]].\n\nA good gamemaster draws the players into the adventure, making it enjoyable for everyone. Good gamemasters have quick minds, sharp wits, and rich imaginations. Gamemasters must also maintain [[game balance]]: hideously overpowered monsters ''or'' players are no fun. It was noted, in 1997, that those who favor their left-brain such as skilled code writers usually do not make it in the ethereal gamemaster world of storytelling and verse.<ref>Pendleton, Jennifer. (August 18, 1997) [[Los Angeles Times]]. ''Trends:Nice Work If You Can Master It.'' Section: Business; Page 6.</ref>\n\n===The four major \"hats\"===\n* '''Author''': The GM plans out (in the loosest sense) the plot of the story of which the player characters will become heroes (or villains, or rich, or whatever); creating (or adapting, or just choosing) the setting, populating that region with villains and other NPCs, and assigning them any necessary backgrounds, motivations, plans and resources.\n* '''Director''': During the game, while each of the other players typically controls the actions of one of the player characters, the GM decides the actions of all the NPCs as they are needed. The GM may also direct a particular \"NPC\" that travels with the party (commonly known as a GMPC), but this may occasionally be open to abuse since the Game Master having a \"pet\" NPC may compromise their neutrality.\n* '''Referee''': In most tabletop RPGs, the rules are supplied to resolve conflicting situations (avoiding the \"Bang! you're dead!\"/\"No, you missed!\" quandary). The GM is expected to provide any necessary interpretation of those rules in fuzzier situations. The GM may also approve or provide House Rules in order to cover these corner cases or provide a different gaming experience.\n* '''Manager''': The least officially prescribed portion of GMing, and thus the part that takes people the most by surprise. The GM is typically the one to organize the game in the first place, find players, schedule sessions, and figure out a place to play, as well as acting as a mediator and having to balance the needs and desires of all participants\u2014sometimes having to divine the real desires of indecisive or self-deluded players.\n\n==In online games==\nIn early [[virtual world]]s gamemasters served as a [[Forum moderator|moderator]] or [[System administration|administrator]]; in [[Multi-User Dungeon|MUD]] game masters were called \"[[Wizard (MUD)|wizards]]\". Gamemastering in the form found in traditional role-playing games has also been used in a semi-automatic virtual worlds. However, human moderation was sometimes considered unfair or out of context in an otherwise automated world.<ref name=\"bartle\">{{cite book\n | last = Bartle | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Bartle\n | title = [[Designing Virtual Worlds]]\n | publisher = New Riders\n | year = 2003\n | isbn = 0-13-101816-7\n}}</ref>\nAs [[online game]]s expanded, gamemaster duties expanded to include being a [[customer service representative]] for an [[online community]]. A gamemaster in such a game is either an experienced volunteer player or an employee of the game's publisher. They enforce the game's rules by banishing spammers, [[Player versus player#Player killing|player killers]], cheaters, and [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]] and by solving players' problems by providing general customer service. For their tasks they use special tools and characters that allow them to do things like teleport to players, summon items, and browse logs that record players' activities. Often, players who feel dissatisfied with the game will blame the GMs directly for any errors or glitches. However, this blame is misdirected as most GMs are not developers and cannot resolve those types of problems.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe now defunct [[America Online]] Online Gaming Forum used to use volunteers selected by applications from its user base. These people were simply referred to as OGFs by other members, and their screennames were indicative of their position (i.e., OGF Moose, etc.). While membership in the Online Gaming Forum had only one real requirement (that is, be a member of AOL), OGFs were given powers quite similar to AOL \"Guides\" and could use them at will to discipline users as they saw appropriate.\n\n''[[World of Warcraft]]'' has employees of [[Blizzard Entertainment]] that serve as gamemasters to help users with various problems in gameplay, chat, and other things like account and billing issues. A gamemaster in this game will communicate with players through chat that has blue text and they will also have a special \"GM\" tag and Blizzard logo in front of their names.<ref name=\"wowwiki\">{{cite web\n | title = Game Master\n | publisher = WowWiki.com\n | url = http://www.wowwiki.com/Game_Master\n | accessdate = 2013-10-20}}</ref>\n\n''[[RuneScape]]'' has more than 500 moderators employed by [[Jagex]] to assist players and perform administrative duties in-game and on the site forums. These ''Jagex Moderators'', as they are called, usually have the word \"Mod\" and a gold crown preceding their account names which ordinary players are not permitted to use. The game also has ''Player Moderators'' and ''Forum Moderators'' who are player volunteers helping with moderation, having the ability to mute (block from chatting) other players who violate rules.\n\n''[[Battleground Europe]]'', a medium-sized MMOFPS has a team of ''Game Moderators'', anonymous volunteers who moderate the game.\n\n''[[Miniconomy]]'', a smaller text-based MMO has a team of ''Federals'', experienced players that help moderate the game and interactions.\n\n''[[Transformice]]'', an MMORPG, has a team of volunteer moderators called ''Mods'' who are experienced players that help moderate the game and interactions.\n\nNote that a few games, notably ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' and ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Redemption]]'', are [[video game]] adaptations of [[tabletop role-playing game]]s that are played online with one player acting as a traditional gamemaster.\n\n==In pervasive games==\nGamemastering, sometimes referred to as Orchestration<ref>{{cite journal\n | last1 = Thompson | first1 = Mark K. | last2 = Weal | first2 = Mark J. | last3 = Michaelides | first3 = Danius T. | last4 = Cruickshank | first4 = Don G. | last5 = De Roure | first5 = David C.\n | title = MUD Slinging: Virtual Orchestration of Physical Interactions\n | journal = University of Southampton ECSTRIAM03-007\n | citeseerx = 10.1.1.109.6617\n | date = 2003}},</ref> is used in [[pervasive game]]s to guide players along a trajectory<ref name=\"Benford2009-Trajectory\">{{cite journal\n |last=Benford \n |first=Steve \n |last2=Giannachi \n |first2=Gabriella \n |last3=Koleva \n |first3=Boriana \n |last4=Rodden \n |first4=Tom \n |title=From interaction to trajectories: designing coherent journeys through user experiences \n |journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems \n |pages=709\u2013718 \n |publisher=ACM \n |date=2009 \n |url=http://gsct3237.kaist.ac.kr/e-lib/Conferences/CHI/2009/docs/p709.pdf \n}}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> desired by the game author.<ref name=\"Jonsson2007\">{{cite journal\n | last = Jonsson\n | first = Staffan\n | last2= Waern\n | first2= Annika\n | last3= Montola\n | first3=Markus\n | last4=Stenros\n | first4= Jaakko\n | title = Game mastering a pervasive larp.

The advent of the [[computer network|networked]] [[personal computer]] provided a solution in the form of online chat programs.  Appropriately equipped gamemasters can find players online and a group can meet via chat rooms, forums, or other electronic means.\n\nIn contrast to standard tabletop procedure (and to games ''designed'' to be played online), this online chat format significantly changed the balance of duties for a prospective gamemaster.  Descriptive text required more preparation, if only via cut-and-paste; acting and voice skills could not be utilized to get the personality of NPCs and monsters across, increasing the value of [[background music]] ('assigned' in advance or individually chosen) as a playing aid.  The GM was likely to need copies of player-character records, being unable to glance at the originals as in normal face-to-face procedure.  The format also forced the issue (particularly when participants were not personally acquainted) of whether to leave all rolling of dice to the GM (making one's own rolls is a privilege not readily surrendered by some players), or to trust all players to honestly report the results of their rolls (the [[honor system]] may be strained when it is in a player's best interest to roll well).\n\nHowever, workarounds to these challenges have only increased over time.  The use of [[Wiki software]] helps GMs and players alike keep track of all manner of game data, sometimes evolving into a home-made gaming supplement.  Scripting software allows unwieldy mechanics (e.g. a complicated formula or repetitive die-rolling) to be resolved at the push of a button.  [[Teleconferencing]] enhances group communication through voice, video, and a shared whiteboard.

New [[DNA]] is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using [[recombinant DNA]] methods or by [[Artificial gene synthesis|artificially synthesising]] the DNA. A [[Vector (molecular biology)|construct]] is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by [[Paul Berg]] in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus [[SV40]] with the [[Lambda phage|lambda virus]]. As well as inserting [[gene]]s, the process can be used to remove, or \"[[Gene knockout|knock out]]\", genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or [[Gene targeting|targeted]] to a specific part of the [[genome]].\n\nAn organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified (GM) and the resulting entity is a [[genetically modified organism]] (GMO). The first GMO was a [[Genetically modified bacterium|bacterium]] generated by [[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] in 1973. [[Rudolf Jaenisch]] created the first GM animal when he inserted foreign DNA into a [[Genetically modified mouse|mouse]] in 1974. The first company to focus on genetic engineering, Genentech, was founded in 1976 and started the production of human proteins. Genetically engineered human [[insulin]] was produced in 1978 and insulin-producing bacteria were commercialised in 1982. [[Genetically modified food]] has been sold since 1994, with the release of the [[Flavr Savr]] tomato. The Flavr Savr was engineered to have a longer shelf life, but most current GM crops are modified to increase resistance to insects and herbicides. [[GloFish]], the first GMO designed as a pet, was sold in the United States in December 2003. In 2016 [[AquAdvantage salmon|salmon]] modified with a growth hormone were sold.\n\nGenetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture. In research GMOs are used to study gene function and expression through loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression experiments. By knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create [[Model organism|animal model organisms]] of human diseases. As well as producing hormones, vaccines and other drugs genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases through [[gene therapy]]. The same techniques that are used to produce drugs can also have industrial applications such as producing enzymes for laundry detergent, cheeses and other products.\n\nThe rise of commercialised [[genetically modified crops]] has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries, but has also been the source of most of the [[Genetically modified food controversies|controversy]] surrounding the technology. This has been present since its early use, the first field trials were destroyed by anti-GM activists. Although there is a [[scientific consensus]] that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, GM food safety is a leading concern with critics. [[Gene flow]], impact on non-target organisms, control of the food supply and [[intellectual property]] rights have also been raised as potential issues. These concerns have led to the development of a regulatory framework, which started in 1975. It has led to an international treaty, the [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], that was adopted in 2000. Individual countries have developed their own regulatory systems regarding GMOs, with the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.\n\n{{Quote box\n| title = [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition\n| quote = '''Genetic engineering''': Process of inserting new genetic information into existing cells in order to modify a specific organism for the purpose of changing its characteristics.\n\n''Note'': Adapted from ref.<ref>{{cite web|website=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency online|title=Terms and Acronyms|url=http://www.epa.gov/OCEPAterms/gterms.html|access-date= 16 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Terminology for biorelated polymers and applications (IUPAC Recommendations 2012)|journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|year=2012|volume=84|issue=2|pages=377\u2013410|doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-12-04|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/pac.2012.84.issue-2/pac-rec-10-12-04/pac-rec-10-12-04.pdf|last1=Vert|first1=Michel|last2=Doi|first2=Yoshiharu|last3=Hellwich|first3=Karl-Heinz|last4=Hess|first4=Michael|last5=Hodge|first5=Philip|last6=Kubisa|first6=Przemyslaw|last7=Rinaudo|first7=Marguerite|last8=Schu\u00e9|first8=Fran\u00e7ois}}</ref>\n| align = right\n| width = 30%\n}}\n\n==Overview==\n\n[[File:Breeding transgenesis cisgenesis.svg|thumb|Comparison of conventional plant breeding with [[transgenic]] and [[cisgenic]] genetic modification|upright=1.7]]\n\nGenetic engineering is a process that alters the genetic structure of an organism by either removing or introducing [[DNA]].

The technique of [[gene targeting]] uses [[homologous recombination]] to make desired changes to a specific [[endogenous]] gene.  This tends to occur at a relatively low frequency in plants and animals and generally requires the use of [[selectable markers]].

This could be the effect on the phenotype of the organism, where the gene is expressed or what other genes it interacts with. These experiments generally involve loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression.\n\n* '''Loss of function experiments''', such as in a [[gene knockout]] experiment, in which an organism is engineered to lack the activity of one or more genes. In a simple knockout a copy of the desired gene has been altered to make it non-functional. [[Embryonic stem cells]] incorporate the altered gene, which replaces the already present functional copy. These stem cells are injected into [[blastocyst]]s, which are implanted into surrogate mothers. This allows the experimenter to analyse the defects caused by this [[mutation]] and thereby determine the role of particular genes. It is used especially frequently in [[developmental biology]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Alberts|first=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Raff|first4=Martin|last5=Roberts|first5=Keith|last6=Walter|first6=Peter|date=2002|title=Studying Gene Expression and Function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26818/|language=en}}</ref> When this is done by creating a library of genes with point mutations at every position in the area of interest, or even every position in the whole gene, this is called \"scanning mutagenesis\". The simplest method, and the first to be used, is \"alanine scanning\", where every position in turn is mutated to the unreactive amino acid [[alanine]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ycVoWFqDTmAC&pg=PA94|title=Protein Engineering and Design|last=Park|first=Sheldon J.|last2=Cochran|first2=Jennifer R.|date=2009-09-25|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420076592|language=en}}</ref>\n* '''Gain of function experiments''', the logical counterpart of knockouts. These are sometimes performed in conjunction with knockout experiments to more finely establish the function of the desired gene. The process is much the same as that in knockout engineering, except that the construct is designed to increase the function of the gene, usually by providing extra copies of the gene or inducing synthesis of the protein more frequently. Gain of function is used to tell whether or not a protein is sufficient for a function, but does not always mean it's required, especially when dealing with genetic or functional redundancy.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* '''Tracking experiments''', which seek to gain information about the localisation and interaction of the desired protein. One way to do this is to replace the wild-type gene with a 'fusion' gene, which is a juxtaposition of the wild-type gene with a reporting element such as [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) that will allow easy visualisation of the products of the genetic modification. While this is a useful technique, the manipulation can destroy the function of the gene, creating secondary effects and possibly calling into question the results of the experiment. More sophisticated techniques are now in development that can track protein products without mitigating their function, such as the addition of small sequences that will serve as binding motifs to monoclonal antibodies.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* '''Expression studies''' aim to discover where and when specific proteins are produced. In these experiments, the DNA sequence before the DNA that codes for a protein, known as a gene's [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], is reintroduced into an organism with the protein coding region replaced by a reporter gene such as GFP or an enzyme that catalyses the production of a dye. Thus the time and place where a particular protein is produced can be observed.

The five known [[manuscript]]s of the Gettysburg Address in Lincoln's hand differ in a number of details, and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprints of the speech. Neither is it clear just where stood the platform from which Lincoln delivered the address.  Modern scholarship locates the speakers' platform 40 yards (or more) away from the traditional site in [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Soldiers' National Cemetery]] at the [[Soldiers' National Monument]], which means that it stood entirely within the private, adjacent [[Evergreen Cemetery (Adams County, Pennsylvania)|Evergreen Cemetery]].\n\n[[File:Gettsyburginvitationpage2.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Wills (Gettysburg)|David Wills]] invited Lincoln to speak.]]\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Battle of Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers dead at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], photographed by [[Timothy H.

In inviting President Lincoln to the ceremonies, [[David Wills (Gettysburg)|David Wills]], of the committee for the November 19 [[Consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg]], wrote, \"It is the desire that, after the Oration, you, as Chief Executive of the nation, formally set apart these grounds to their sacred use by a few appropriate remarks.\"<ref name=\"wills\">Wills, Garry.

Seward|William Seward]], [[John Palmer Usher|John Usher]] and [[Montgomery Blair]], several foreign officials,  his secretary [[John Nicolay]], and his assistant secretary, [[John Hay]].  During the trip Lincoln remarked to Hay that he felt weak; on the morning of November 19, Lincoln mentioned to Nicolay that he was dizzy. Hay noted that during the speech Lincoln's face had \"a ghastly color\" and that he was \"sad, mournful, almost haggard.\" After the speech, when Lincoln boarded the 6:30 pm train for Washington, D.C., he was feverish and weak, with a severe headache. A protracted illness followed, which included a vesicular rash; it was diagnosed as a mild case of [[smallpox]]. It thus seems highly likely that Lincoln was in the [[Prodrome|prodromal]] period of smallpox when he delivered the Gettysburg address.<ref name=Goldman_Schmalstieg>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 17551612\n| year = 2007\n| author1 = Goldman\n| first1 = A.

For example, [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton]] had employed similar phraseology in 1819: \"I am a man chosen for the people, by the people; and, if elected, I will do no other business than that of the people.\" See Broughton, John and Burdett, Francis.

In asserting the superiority of federal power over the states, Chief Justice Marshall stated: \"The government of the Union, then (whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case), is, emphatically and truly, a government of the people. In form, and in substance, it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit.\" Lincoln, a lawyer and President engaged in the greatest struggle of federalism, was (more eloquently) echoing the preeminent case that had solidified federal power over the States.\n\nWills observed Lincoln's usage of the imagery of birth, life, and death in reference to a nation \"brought forth\", \"conceived\", and that shall not \"perish\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Vosmeier, Matthew Noah|journal=Lincoln Lore|title=Lincoln and the 'Central Idea of the Occasion': Garry Wills's Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words that Remade America.|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jala;view=text;rgn=main;idno=2629860.0015.206|publisher=The Lincoln Museum|accessdate=November 9, 2009|date=January\u2013February 1992}}</ref> Others, including [[Allen C.

The family went to the town square where the procession was to form to go out to the cemetery that had not been completed yet. At the head of the procession rode Lincoln on a gray horse preceded by a military band that was the first the young boy had ever seen. Rathvon describes Lincoln as so tall and with such long legs that they went almost to the ground; he also mentions the long eloquent speech given by [[Edward Everett]] of Massachusetts whom Rathvon accurately described as the \"most finished orator of the day\". Rathvon then goes on to describe how Lincoln stepped forward and \"with a manner serious almost to sadness, gave his brief address\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615005816/http://www.neh.gov/projects/transcripts/lostandfoundtranscript.html \"Lost and Found Sound: An American Record Transcript\"], National Endowment for the Humanities.</ref> During the delivery, along with some other boys, young Rathvon wiggled his way forward through the crowd until he stood within 15 feet of Mr. Lincoln and looked up into what he described as Lincoln's \"serious face\". Rathvon recalls candidly that, although he listened \"intently to every word the president uttered and heard it clearly\", he explains, \"boylike, I could not recall any of it afterwards\". But he explains that if anyone said anything disparaging about \"honest Abe\", there would have been a \"junior battle of Gettysburg\". In the recording Rathvon speaks of Lincoln's speech allegorically \"echoing through the hills\".\n\n=== Photographs ===\n\nThe only known and confirmed photograph of Lincoln at Gettysburg,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/gettysburgaddress/exhibitionitems/ExhibitObjects/LincolnOnPlatform.aspx?sc_id=wikip|title=The Only Known Photograph of President Lincoln at the dedication of the Civil War cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, November 19, 1863|accessdate=September 15, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105105115/http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/gettysburgaddress/exhibitionitems/ExhibitObjects/LincolnOnPlatform.aspx?sc_id=wikip|archivedate=November 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> taken by photographer [[David Bachrach]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Bachrach in the news|publisher=Bachrach photography |url=http://www.bachrachinc.com/html/in_the_news.html |accessdate=December 3, 2007}}</ref> was identified in the [[Mathew Brady]] collection of photographic plates in the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] in 1952. While Lincoln's speech was short and may have precluded multiple pictures of him while speaking, he and the other dignitaries sat for hours during the rest of the program. Given the length of Everett's speech and the length of time it took for 19th-century photographers to get \"set up\" before taking a picture, it is quite plausible that the photographers were ill-prepared for the brevity of Lincoln's remarks.\n\n[[File:Crowd of citizens, soldiers, and etc. with Lincoln at Gettysburg. - NARA - 529085 -crop.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.5|Cropped view of the Bachrach photo, with a red arrow indicating Lincoln.]]\n\n=== Usage of \"under God\" ===\nThe words \"under God\" do not appear in the Nicolay and Hay drafts but are included in the three later copies (Everett, Bancroft, and Bliss).

Ronald C. White, visiting professor of history at the University of California \u2013 Los Angeles and professor of American religious history emeritus at the San Francisco Theological Seminary, wrote in this context of Lincoln's insertion and usage of \"under God\":\n\n<blockquote>It was an uncharacteristically spontaneous revision for a speaker who did not trust extemporaneous speech. Lincoln had added impromptu words in several earlier speeches, but always offered a subsequent apology for the change. In this instance, he did not. And Lincoln included \"under God\" in all three copies of the address he prepared at later dates. \"Under God\" pointed backward and forward: back to \"this nation\", which drew its breath from both political and religious sources, but also forward to a \"new birth\". Lincoln had come to see the Civil War as a ritual of purification. The old Union had to die. The old man had to die. Death became a transition to a new Union and a new humanity.<ref name=\"america58\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe phrase \"under God\" was used frequently in works published before 1860, usually with the meaning \"with God's help\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Geoff Nunberg |title='(Next) Under God,' Phrasal Idiom |date=June 20, 2004 |work=Language Log |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001090.html |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Platform location==\n{{Infobox designation list\n| embed                   =\n| designation1            = Pennsylvania Historical Marker\n| designation1_offname    = Gettysburg Address\n| designation1_type       = Roadside\n| designation1_criteria   =\n| designation1_date       = December 12, 1947<ref name=\"PHMC Gettysburg Address\">{{cite web|title=Gettysburg Address|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/PHMCWebSearch/ViewMarker.aspx?markerId=784|website=PHMC Historical Markers|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref>\n| delisted1_date          =\n| designation1_partof     =\n| designation1_number     =\n| designation1_free1name  = Location\n| designation1_free1value = PA 134 (Taneytown Rd.) at entrance to National Cemetery<br>Baltimore St. (old US 140) & PA 134 at entrance to National Cemetery\n}}\n[[File:LincolnGett.JPG|right|thumb|The Lincoln Address Memorial, designed by Louis Henrick, with bust of Lincoln by [[Henry Kirke Bush-Brown]]<!--appears to be by--><!-- rather than his uncle [[Henry Kirke Brown]]-->, erected at the Gettysburg National Cemetery in 1912.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einhorn|first=Lois|title=Abraham Lincoln, the orator: penetrating the Lincoln legend|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0RB3AAAAMAAJ&q=%22Henry+Bush-Brown%22+lincoln&dq=%22Henry+Bush-Brown%22+lincoln|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1992|isbn=0-313-26168-7|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref>]]\nOutside the Cemetery and within sight of the cross-walk, a historical marker reads:\n\n<blockquote>Nearby, Nov. 19, 1863, in dedicating the National Cemetery, Abraham Lincoln gave the address which he had written in Washington and revised after his arrival at Gettysburg the evening of November 18.<ref>{{cite web|last=Historical Marker Database|title=Gettysburg Address Marker|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=8025|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDirectly inside the Taneytown Road entrance are located the [[Gettysburg Rostrum|Rostrum]] and the ''Lincoln Address Memorial.''

It sets the frame for a run of successive, non-overlapping codons, which is known as an \"[[open reading frame]]\" ([[open reading frame|ORF]]). For example, the string 5'-AAATGAACG-3' (see figure), if read from the first position, contains the codons AAA, TGA, and ACG ; if read from the second position, it contains the codons AAT and GAA ; and if read from the third position, it contains the codons ATG and AAC. Every sequence can, thus, be read in its [[5' to 3'|5' \u2192 3' direction]] in three [[reading frames]], each producing a possibly distinct amino acid sequence: in the given example, Lys (K)-Trp (W)-Thr (T), Asn (N)-Glu (E), or Met (M)-Asn (N), respectively (when translating with the vertebrate mitochondrial code).

The start  codon alone is not sufficient to begin the process. Nearby sequences such as the [[Shine-Dalgarno]] sequence in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and [[initiation factor]]s are also required to start translation. The most common start codon is AUG, which is read as [[methionine]] or, in bacteria, as [[N-Formylmethionine|formylmethionine]]. Alternative start codons depending on the organism include \"GUG\" or \"UUG\"; these codons normally represent [[valine]] and [[leucine]], respectively, but as start codons they are translated as methionine or formylmethionine.<ref name=\"pmid12867081\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Touriol C, Bornes S, Bonnal S, Audigier S, Prats H, Prats AC, Vagner S | title = Generation of protein isoform diversity by alternative initiation of translation at non-AUG codons | journal = Biology of the Cell / Under the Auspices of the European Cell Biology Organization | volume = 95 | issue = 3\u20134 | pages = 169\u201378 | date = 2003 | pmid = 12867081 | doi = 10.1016/S0248-4900(03)00033-9 }}</ref>\n\nThe three [[stop codon]]s have names: UAG is ''amber'', UGA is ''opal'' (sometimes also called ''umber''), and UAA is ''ochre''.

This term was given by Bernfield and Nirenberg. The genetic code has redundancy but no ambiguity (see the [[#RNA codon table|codon tables]] below for the full correlation). For example, although codons GAA and GAG both specify [[glutamic acid]] (redundancy), neither specifies another amino acid (no ambiguity). The codons encoding one amino acid may differ in any of their three positions. For example, the amino acid leucine is specified by '''Y'''U'''R''' or CU'''N''' (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, or CUG) codons (difference in the first or third position indicated using [[Nucleic acid notation|IUPAC notation]]), while the amino acid [[serine]] is specified by UC'''N''' or AG'''Y''' (UCA, UCG, UCC, UCU, AGU, or AGC) codons (difference in the first, second, or third position).<ref name=\"MBG\">{{cite book|first=James D. |last=Watson|title=Molecular Biology of the Gene|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=MByWPwAACAAJ}}|year=2008|publisher=Pearson/Benjamin Cummings|isbn=978-0-8053-9592-1}}</ref>{{rp|[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=MByWPwAACAAJ|page=102}} 102\u2013117]}} {{rp|[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=MByWPwAACAAJ|page=521}} 521\u2013522]}}  A practical consequence of redundancy is that errors in the third position of the triplet codon cause only a silent mutation or an error that would not affect the protein because the [[hydrophilicity]] or [[hydrophobicity]] is maintained by equivalent substitution of amino acids; for example, a codon of NUN (where N = any nucleotide) tends to code for hydrophobic amino acids. NCN yields amino acid residues that are small in size and moderate in hydropathy; NAN encodes average size hydrophilic residues. The genetic code is so well-structured for hydropathy that a mathematical analysis ([[Singular value decomposition|Singular Value Decomposition]]) of 12 variables (4 nucleotides x 3 positions) yields a remarkable correlation (C = 0.95) for predicting the hydropathy of the encoded amino acid directly from the triplet nucleotide sequence, ''without translation.''<ref name=\"Michel-Beyerle1990\">{{cite book|first=Maria Elisabeth |last=Michel-Beyerle|title=Reaction centers of photosynthetic bacteria: Feldafing-II-Meeting|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=xD5OAQAAIAAJ}}|year=1990|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-3-540-53420-4}}</ref><ref>F\u00fcllen G, Youvan DC (1994). \"Genetic Algorithms and Recursive Ensemble Mutagenesis in Protein Engineering\".

Such charge reversal may have dramatic consequences for the structure or function of a protein. This aspect may have been largely underestimated by previous studies. \n[[File:Genetic Code Simple Corrected.pdf|thumb|Grouping of codons by amino acid residue molar volume and [[hydropathy index|hydropathy]].

part of the [[origin of life|story of life]], according to which self-replicating RNA molecules preceded life as we know it. The main hypothesis for life's origin is the [[RNA world hypothesis]]. Any model for the emergence of genetic code is intimately related to a model of the transfer from [[ribozyme]]s (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern [[aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase]]s, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.<ref name=De1998>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ribas de Pouplana L, Turner RJ, Steer BA, Schimmel P | title = Genetic code origins: tRNAs older than their synthetases? | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 19 | pages = 11295\u2013300 | date = Sep 1998 | pmid = 9736730 | pmc = 21636 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.19.11295 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...9511295D }}</ref>\n\nA hypothetical randomly evolved genetic code further motivates a biochemical or evolutionary model for its origin.

In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci numbers]], and the double unit. He took suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system.

Below are two short proofs of irrationality:\n\n====Contradiction from an expression in lowest terms====\n[[File:Whirling squares.svg|thumb|right|If &phi; were [[Rational number|rational]], then it would be the ratio of sides of a rectangle with integer sides (the rectangle comprising the entire diagram). But it would also be a ratio of integer sides of the smaller rectangle (the rightmost portion of the diagram) obtained by deleting a square. The sequence of decreasing integer side lengths formed by deleting squares cannot be continued indefinitely because the integers have a lower bound, so &phi; cannot be rational.]]\n\nRecall that:\n\n: the whole is the longer part plus the shorter part;\n: the whole is to the longer part as the longer part is to the shorter part.\n\nIf we call the whole ''n'' and the longer part ''m'', then the second statement above becomes\n\n: ''n'' is to ''m'' as ''m'' is to ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''m'',\n\nor, algebraically\n\n: <math> \\frac nm = \\frac{m}{n-m}.\\qquad (*) </math>\n\nTo say that the golden ratio {{math|''\u03c6''}} is rational means that {{math|''\u03c6''}} is a fraction ''n''/''m'' where ''n'' and ''m'' are integers.  We may take ''n''/''m'' to be in [[lowest terms]] and ''n'' and ''m'' to be positive. But if ''n''/''m'' is in lowest terms, then the identity labeled (*) above says ''m''/(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''m'') is in still lower terms. That is a contradiction that follows from the assumption that {{math|''\u03c6''}} is rational.\n\n====By irrationality of {{radic|5}}====\nAnother short proof\u2014perhaps more commonly known\u2014of the irrationality of the golden ratio makes use of the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of rational numbers under addition and multiplication. If <math>\\textstyle\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}</math> is rational, then <math>\\textstyle2\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) - 1= \\sqrt{5}</math> is also rational, which is a contradiction if it is already known that the square root of a non-[[square number|square]] [[natural number]] is irrational.\n\n===Minimal polynomial===\nThe golden ratio is also an [[algebraic number]] and even an [[algebraic integer]].

The angles in a triangle add up to 180\u00b0, so 5\u03b1 = 180, giving \u03b1 = 36\u00b0. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36\u00b0-72\u00b0-72\u00b0. The angles of the remaining obtuse isosceles triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36\u00b0-36\u00b0-108\u00b0.\n\nSuppose XB has length 1, and we call BC length {{math|''\u03c6''}}. Because of the isosceles triangles XC=XA and BC=XC, so these are also length&nbsp;\u03c6. Length AC&nbsp;=&nbsp;AB, therefore equals {{math|''\u03c6''}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. But triangle ABC is similar to triangle CXB, so AC/BC&nbsp;=&nbsp;BC/BX, AC/{{math|''\u03c6''}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03c6/1, and so AC also equals {{math|''\u03c6''}}<sup>2</sup>. Thus {{math|''\u03c6''}}<sup>2</sup> =&nbsp;\u03c6&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, confirming that {{math|''\u03c6''}} is indeed the golden ratio.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of the area of the larger triangle AXC to the smaller CXB is equal to {{math|''\u03c6''}}, while the [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] ratio is&nbsp;\u03c6&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n\n=====Pentagon=====\nIn a [[pentagon#Regular pentagons|regular pentagon]] the ratio of a diagonal to a side is the golden ratio, while intersecting diagonals section each other in the golden ratio.<ref name = \"Pacioli\"/>\n\n=====Odom's construction=====\n[[File:Odom.svg|thumb|218 px|Let A and B be midpoints of the sides EF and ED of an equilateral triangle DEF.

This result is a straightforward consequence of the [[intersecting chords theorem]] and can be used to construct a regular pentagon, a construction that attracted the attention of the noted Canadian geometer [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H.

Coxeter]] who published it in Odom's name as a diagram in the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' accompanied by the single word \"Behold!\" <ref>{{cite web|title=Quandaries and Queries|url=http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/qq/database/QQ.09.02/mary1.html|publisher=Math Central|accessdate=23 October 2011|author=Chris and Penny}}</ref>\n\n=====Pentagram=====\n[[File:Pentagram-phi.svg|right|thumb|A pentagram colored to distinguish its line segments of different lengths. The four\nlengths are in golden ratio to one another.]]\nThe golden ratio plays an important role in the geometry of [[pentagram]]s. Each intersection of edges sections other edges in the golden ratio.

==\nAll the cells of an organism originate from a single cell, so they are expected to have identical genomes; however, in some cases, differences arise. Both the process of copying DNA during cell division and exposure to environmental mutagens can result in mutations in somatic cells. In some cases, such mutations lead to cancer because they cause cells to divide more quickly and invade surrounding tissues.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Martincorena I, Campbell PJ | title = Somatic mutation in cancer and normal cells | journal = Science | volume = 349 | issue = 6255 | pages = 1483\u201389 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26404825 | doi = 10.1126/science.aab4082 | bibcode = 2015Sci...349.1483M }}</ref> In certain lymphocytes in the human immune system, [[V(D)J recombination]] generates different genomic sequences such that each cell produces a unique antibody or T cell receptors.\n\nDuring [[meiosis]], diploid cells divide twice to produce haploid germ cells. During this process, recombination results in a reshuffling of the genetic material from homologous chromosomes so each gamete has a unique genome.\n\n== Genome evolution ==\nGenomes are more than the sum of an organism's [[gene]]s and have traits that may be [[Measurement|measured]] and studied without reference to the details of any particular genes and their products. Researchers compare traits such as [[karyotype]] (chromosome number), [[genome size]], gene order, [[codon usage bias]], and [[GC-content]] to determine what mechanisms could have produced the great variety of genomes that exist today (for recent overviews, see Brown 2002; Saccone and Pesole 2003; Benfey and Protopapas 2004; Gibson and Muse 2004; Reese 2004; Gregory 2005).\n\n[[gene duplication|Duplications]] play a major role in shaping the genome. Duplication may range from extension of [[short tandem repeats]], to duplication of a cluster of genes, and all the way to duplication of entire chromosomes or even [[polyploidy|entire genomes]]. Such duplications are probably fundamental to the creation of genetic novelty.\n\n[[Horizontal gene transfer]] is invoked to explain how there is often an extreme similarity between small portions of the genomes of two organisms that are otherwise very distantly related. Horizontal gene transfer seems to be common among many [[microbe]]s. Also, [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]] seem to have experienced a transfer of some genetic material from their [[chloroplast]] and [[mitochondria]]l genomes to their nuclear chromosomes. Recent empirical data suggest an important role of viruses and sub-viral RNA-networks to represent a main driving role to generate genetic novelty and natural genome editing.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Witzany G | title = The agents of natural genome editing | journal = Journal of Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 181\u201389 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21459884 | doi = 10.1093/jmcb/mjr005 }}</ref>\n\n== In fiction ==\nWorks of science fiction illustrate concerns about the availability of genome sequences.\n\nMichael Crichton's 1990 novel [[Jurassic Park (novel)|''Jurassic Park'']] and the subsequent [[Jurassic Park (film)|film]] tell the story of a billionaire who creates a theme park of cloned dinosaurs on a remote island, with disastrous outcomes. A geneticist extracts dinosaur DNA from the blood of ancient mosquitoes and fills in the gaps with DNA from modern species to create several species of dinosaurs. A chaos theorist is asked to give his expert opinion on the safety of engineering an ecosystem with the dinosaurs, and he repeatedly warns that the outcomes of the project will be unpredictable and ultimately uncontrollable. These warnings about the perils of using genomic information are a major theme of the book.\n\nThe 1997 film ''[[Gattaca]]'' is set in a futurist society where genomes of children are engineered to contain the most ideal combination of their parents' traits, and metrics such as risk of heart disease and predicted life expectancy are documented for each person based on their genome. People conceived outside of the eugenics program, known as \"In-Valids\" suffer discrimination and are relegated to menial occupations. The protagonist of the film is an In-Valid who works to defy the supposed genetic odds and achieve his dream of working as a space navigator. The film warns against a future where genomic information fuels prejudice and extreme class differences between those who can and can't afford genetically engineered children.<ref>{{cite web | title = Gattaca (movie) | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gattaca/ | work = Rotten Tomatoes }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{col div|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Bacterial genome size]]\n* [[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]]\n* [[UCSC Genome Browser|Genome Browser]]\n* [[Genome Compiler]]\n* [[Circuit topology|Genome topology]]\n* [[Genome-wide association study]]\n* [[List of sequenced animal genomes]]\n* [[List of sequenced archaeal genomes]]\n* [[List of sequenced bacterial genomes]]\n* [[List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes]]\n* [[List of sequenced fungi genomes]]\n* [[List of sequenced plant genomes]]\n* [[List of sequenced plastomes]]\n* [[List of sequenced protist genomes]]\n* [[Metagenomics]]\n* [[Microbiome]]\n* [[Molecular epidemiology]]\n* [[Molecular pathological epidemiology]]\n* [[Molecular pathology]]\n* [[Nucleic acid sequence]]\n* [[Pan-genome]]\n* [[Precision medicine]]\n* [[Sequenceome]]\n* [[Whole genome sequencing]]\n{{_colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Benfey P, Protopapas AD|title=Essentials of Genomics|publisher=Prentice Hall|date=2004}}\n* {{cite book | last1=Brown|first1=Terence A. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Genomes 2|publisher=Bios Scientific Publishers|location=Oxford|date=2002|isbn=978-1-85996-029-5 }}\n* {{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Greg| last2=Muse | first2 = Spencer V. | name-list-format = vanc |title=A Primer of Genome Science|edition=Second|publisher=Sinauer Assoc|location=Sunderland, Mass|date=2004|isbn=978-0-87893-234-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Gregory|first=T.

This set of [[Gaia hypothesis|theories]] holds that all organisms on a life-giving planet regulate the [[biosphere]] in such a way as to promote its habitability. Gaia concept draws a connection between the survivability of a species (hence its [[evolutionary]] course) and its usefulness to the survival of other species.\n\nWhile there were a number of precursors to Gaia theory, the first scientific form of this idea was proposed as the [[Gaia hypothesis]] by [[James Lovelock]], a UK chemist, in 1970. The Gaia hypothesis deals with the concept of biological [[homeostasis]], and claims the resident life forms of a host planet coupled with their environment have acted and act like a single, self-regulating system. This system includes the near-surface rocks, the soil, and the atmosphere. Today many scientists consider such ideas to be unsupported by, or at odds with, the available evidence (see [[Gaia hypothesis#Recent criticism|recent criticism]]). These theories are however significant in [[green politics]].\n\n== Predecessors to the Gaia theory ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Gaia hypothesis]] -->\nThere are some mystical, scientific and religious predecessors to the Gaia philosophy, which had a Gaia-like conceptual basis.  Many religious mythologies had a view of Earth as being a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts (e.g. some Native American religions and various forms of [[shamanism]]).\n\n[[Lewis Thomas]] believed that Earth should be viewed as a single cell; he derived this view from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s view of Earth as a single round organism.\n\n[[Isaac Newton]] wrote of the earth, \"Thus this Earth resembles a great animall or rather inanimate vegetable, draws in [[Aether (classical element)|\u00e6thereall]] breath for its dayly refreshment & vitall ferment & transpires again with gross exhalations, And according to the condition of all other things living ought to have its times of beginning youth old age & perishing.\"<ref>Of Natures obvious laws & processes in vegetation, [http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/mss/norm/ALCH00081 Dibner MS 1031]</ref>\n\n[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[paleontologist]] and [[geologist]], believed that evolution unfolded from cell to organism to planet to solar system and ultimately the whole universe, as we humans see it from our limited perspective.  Teilhard later influenced [[Thomas Berry]] and many Catholic humanist thinkers of the 20th century.\n\n[[Buckminster Fuller]] is generally credited with making the idea respectable in Western scientific circles in the 20th century.  Building to some degree on his observations and artifacts, e.g. the [[Dymaxion map]] of the Earth he created, others began to ask if there was a way to make the Gaia theory scientifically sound.\n\n[[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]] in 1970 in an article in ''[[Green Egg]]'' Magazine, independently articulated the Gaia Thesis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://original.caw.org/articles/theagenesis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617000211/http://original.caw.org/articles/theagenesis.html |archivedate=2010-06-17 |df= }}</ref>\n\nNone of these ideas are considered scientific hypotheses; by definition a scientific hypothesis must make testable predictions.  As the above claims are not testable, they are outside the bounds of current science.\n\nThese are conjectures and perhaps can only be considered as social and maybe political philosophy; they may have implications for [[theology]], or ''[[thealogy]]'' as Zell-Ravenheart and [[Isaac Bonewits]] put it.\n\n== Range of views ==\n\nAccording to [[James Kirchner]] there is a spectrum of Gaia hypotheses, ranging from the undeniable to radical. At one end is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position is that the Earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self-organizing system which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of equilibrium that is conducive to life.  Today many scientists consider that such a view (and any stronger views) are unlikely to be correct.<ref>{{cite book |last=Waltham |first=David |authorlink=David Waltham |date=2014|title=Lucky Planet: Why Earth is Exceptional \u2013 and What that Means for Life in the Universe |url=http://www.iconbooks.com/blog/title/lucky-planet/ |location= |publisher=Icon Books |page= |isbn=9781848316560 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Beerling |first=David |authorlink=David Beerling|date=2007 |title=The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192806024.do |location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page= |isbn= 978-0-19-280602-4 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cockell |last2=Corfield |first2=Richard |last3=Dise |first3= Nancy  |last4=Edwards |first4=Neil  |last5=Harris |first5=Nigel  |date=2008 |title= An Introduction to the Earth-Life System |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/palaeontology-and-life-history/introduction-earth-life-system |location=Cambridge (UK) |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |page= |isbn= 9780521729536 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last= Tyrrell |first = Toby |title =Gaia: the verdict is\u2026 |journal = New Scientist |volume = 220 |pages = 30\u201331 |date= 26 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62532-4}}</ref><ref name=\"tyrrell209\">{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}</ref> An even stronger claim is that all lifeforms are part of a single planetary being, called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas, the terrestrial crust would be the result of interventions carried out by Gaia, through the [[coevolution|coevolving]] diversity of living organisms.\n\nThe most extreme form of Gaia theory is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism with a highly intelligent mind that arose as an [[emergent property]] of the whole biosphere. In this view, the Earth's biosphere is ''consciously'' manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come about because many people do not understand the concept of [[homeostasis]]. Many non-scientists instinctively and incorrectly see homeostasis as a process that requires conscious control {{dubious|date=October 2014}} {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}.\n\nThe more speculative versions of Gaia, including versions in which it is believed that the Earth is actually conscious, sentient, and highly intelligent, are usually considered outside the bounds of what is usually considered science.\n\n== Gaia in biology and science ==\n{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}\n\n[[Buckminster Fuller]] has been credited as the first to incorporate scientific ideas into a Gaia theory, which he did with his [[Dymaxion map]] of the Earth.\n\nThe first scientifically rigorous theory was the [[Gaia hypothesis]] by [[James Lovelock]], a UK chemist.\n\nA variant of this hypothesis was developed by [[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist, in 1979.\nHer version is sometimes called the \"Gaia Theory\" (note uppercase-T). Her model is more limited in scope than the one that Lovelock proposed.\n\nWhether this sort of system is present on Earth is still open to debate. Some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, when [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] levels rise, plants are able to grow better and thus remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other biological effects and feedbacks exist,<ref name=\"tyrrell209\"/> but the extent to which these mechanisms have stabilized and modified the Earth's overall climate is largely not known.\n\nThe Gaia hypothesis is sometimes viewed from significantly different philosophical perspectives. Some environmentalists view it as an almost conscious process, in which the Earth's [[ecosystem]] is literally viewed as a single unified organism. Some evolutionary biologists, on the other hand, view it as an undirected [[emergent property]] of the ecosystem: as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Proponents of this view sometimes point to examples of life's actions in the past that have resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one.\n\nDepending on how strongly the case is stated, the hypothesis conflicts with mainstream [[neo-Darwinism]]. Most biologists would accept Daisyworld-style homeostasis as possible, but would certainly not accept the idea that this equates to the whole biosphere acting as one organism.\n\nA very small number of scientists, and a much larger number of environmental activists, claim that Earth's biosphere is ''consciously'' manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence to support this belief.\n\n== Gaia in the social sciences ==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nA [[social science]] view of Gaia theory is the role of humans as a [[keystone species]] who may be able to accomplish global [[homeostasis]]. Whilst a few social scientists who draw inspiration from 'organic' views of society have embraced Gaia philosophy as a way to explain the human-nature interconnections, most professional social scientists are more involved in reflecting upon the way Gaia philosophy is used and engaged with within sub-sections of society. Alan Marshall, in the Department of Social Sciences at Mahidol University, for example, reflects upon the way Gaia philosophy has been used and advocated by environmentalists, spiritualists, managers, economists, and scientists and engineers (see The Unity of Nature, 2002, Imperial College Press: London and Singapore). Social Scientists themselves in the 1960s gave up on systems ideas of society since they were interpreted as supporting conservatism and traditionalism.\n\n== Gaia in politics ==\n\nSome radical political environmentalists who accept some form of the Gaia theory call themselves [[Gaian Greens|Gaians]]. They actively seek to restore the Earth's homeostasis \u2014 whenever they see it out of balance, e.g. to prevent manmade [[climate change]], [[primate]] extinction, or [[deforestation|rainforest loss]]. In effect, they seek to cooperate to become the \"system consciously manipulating to make conditions more conducive to life\". Such activity defines the homeostasis, but for leverage it relies on deep investigation of the homeorhetic balances, if only to find [[places to intervene in a system]] which is changing in undesirable ways.\n\nTony Bondhus brings up the point in his book, ''Society of Conceivia'', that if Gaia is alive, then societies are living things as well. This suggests that our understanding of Gaia can be used to create a better society and to design a better political system.\n\nOther intellectuals in the environmental movement, like [[Edward Goldsmith]], have used Gaia in the completely opposite way; to stake a claim about how Gaia's focus on natural balance and resistance and resilience, should be emulated to design a conservative political system (as explored in Alan Marshall's 2002 book ''The Unity of Nature'', (Imperial College Press: London).\n\nGaians do not passively ask \"what is going on\", but rather, \"what to do next\", e.g. in [[terraforming]] or [[climate engineering]] or even on a small scale, such as [[gardening]]. Changes can be planned, agreed upon by many people, being very deliberate, as in [[urban ecology]] and especially [[industrial ecology]]. ''See [[arcology]] for more on this 'active' view.''\n\nGaians argue that it is a human [[duty]] to act as such - committing themselves in particular to the [[Precautionary Principle]]. Such views began to influence the [[Green Parties]], [[Greenpeace]], and a few more radical wings of the [[environmental movement]] such as the Gaia Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front. These views dominate some such groups, e.g. the [[Bioneers]]. Some refer to this political activity as a separate and radical branch of the [[ecology movement]], one that takes the axioms of the science of ecology in general, and Gaia theory in particular, and raises them to a kind of theory of [[personal conduct]] or [[moral code]].\n\n== Gaia in religion ==\n\nThe ecologist and theologian Anne Primavesi is the author of two books dealing with the Gaia hypothesis and theology.<ref>[http://www.westarinstitute.org/membership/westar-fellows/fellows-directory/anne-primavesi/ Anne Primavesi - Westar Institute Westar Institute<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[Rosemary Radford Ruether]], the American feminist scholar and theologian, wrote a book called \"Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing\".\n\nA book edited by Allan Hunt Badiner called Dharma Gaia explores the ground where Buddhism and ecology meet through writings by the [[Dalai Lama]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Joanna Macy]], [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], and 25 other Buddhists and ecologists.<ref>[http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&key=BOOKDG] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315015100/http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&key=BOOKDG |date=March 15, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMany new age authors have written books which mix [[New Age]] teachings with Gaia philosophy. This is known as [[New Age Gaian]]. Often referred to as Gaianism, or the Gaian Religion, this spiritual aspect of the philosophy is very broad and inclusive, making it adaptable to other religions: Taoism, Neo-Paganism, Pantheism, Judeo-Christian Religions, and many others.\n\n== Semantic debate ==\n\nThe question of \"what is an [[organism]]\", and at what scale is it rational to speak about organisms vs. biospheres, gives rise to a semantic debate. We are all ecologies in the sense that our (human) bodies contain [[gut bacteria]], [[parasite]] species, etc., and to them our body is not organism but rather more of a [[microclimate]] or [[biome]]. Applying that thinking to whole planets:\n\nThe argument is that these symbiotic organisms, being unable to survive apart from each other and their climate and local conditions, form an organism in their own right, under a wider conception of the term organism than is conventionally used. It is a matter for often heated debate whether this is a valid usage of the term, but ultimately it appears to be a [[semantic dispute]]. In this sense of the word organism, it is argued under the theory that the entire biomass of the Earth is a single organism (as [[Johannes Kepler]] thought).\n\nUnfortunately, many supporters of the various Gaia theories do not state exactly where they sit on this spectrum; this makes discussion and criticism difficult.\n\nMuch effort on behalf of those analyzing the theory currently is an attempt to clarify what these different hypotheses are, and whether they are proposals to 'test' or 'manipulate' outcomes. Both Lovelock's and Margulis's understanding of Gaia are considered scientific hypotheses, and like all scientific theories are constantly put to the test.\n\nMore speculative versions of Gaia, including all versions in which it is held that the Earth is actually conscious, are currently held to be outside the bounds of science, and are not supported by either Lovelock or Margulis.\n\n=== Gaian reproduction ===\n\nOne of the most problematic issues with referring to Gaia as an organism is its apparent failure to meet the [[biological]] criterion of being able to [[reproduce]]. [[Richard Dawkins]] has asserted that the planet is not the offspring of any parents and is unable to reproduce.<ref name=\"Harding2006\">{{cite book |author=Harding, Stephan |title=Animate Earth |publisher=[[Chelsea Green Publishing]] |date=2006 |pages=65 |isbn=1-933392-29-0 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Arcology]]\n* [[Climate engineering]]\n* [[Environmental philosophy]]\n* [[Gaia Foundation]]\n* [[Gaian Greens]]\n* [[Gaia (mythology)]]\n* [[Gaia hypothesis]] (James Lovelock's ideas)\n* [[Gaianism]]\n* [[Gardening]]\n* [[James Kirchner]]\n* [[Guy Murchie]]\n* [[Keystone species]]\n* [[Odic force]]\n* [[Places to intervene in a system]]\n* [[Pantheism]]\n* [[Technogaianism]]\n* [[Teleology]]\n* [[Urban ecology]]\n* [[Steven M.

About 26% of the incoming solar energy is reflected to space by the atmosphere and clouds, and 19% is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds. Most of the remaining energy is absorbed at the surface of Earth. [[Wien's displacement law|Because the Earth's surface is colder]] than the Sun, it radiates at [[Infrared|wavelengths that are much longer]] than the wavelengths that were absorbed. Most of this thermal radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere and warms it. The atmosphere also gains heat by sensible and latent heat fluxes from the surface. The atmosphere radiates energy both upwards and downwards; the part radiated downwards is absorbed by the surface of Earth. This leads to a higher [[equilibrium temperature]] than if the atmosphere were absent.\n\n[[Image:Solar Spectrum.png|thumb|right|320px|The [[solar radiation]] spectrum for direct light at both the top of Earth's atmosphere and at sea level]]\n\nAn ideal thermally conductive [[blackbody]] at the same distance from the Sun as Earth would have a temperature of about {{convert|5.3|C}}.

The atmosphere near the surface is largely opaque to thermal radiation (with important exceptions for \"window\" bands), and most heat loss from the surface is by [[sensible heat]] and [[latent heat]] transport. Radiative energy losses become increasingly important higher in the atmosphere, largely because of the decreasing concentration of water vapor, an important greenhouse gas. It is more realistic to think of the greenhouse effect as applying to a \"surface\" in the mid-[[troposphere]], which is effectively coupled to the surface by a [[lapse rate]]. The simple picture also assumes a steady state, but in the real world, there are variations due to the [[diurnal cycle]] as well as the seasonal cycle and weather disturbances. Solar heating only applies during daytime. During the night, the atmosphere cools somewhat, but not greatly, because its emissivity is low. [[Diurnal temperature variation|Diurnal temperature changes]] decrease with height in the atmosphere.\n\nWithin the region where radiative effects are important, the description given by the [[idealized greenhouse model]] becomes realistic. Earth's surface, warmed to a temperature around 255&nbsp;K, radiates long-wavelength, [[infrared]] heat in the range of 4\u2013100&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=\"Mitchell-1989\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/RG027i001p00115|last=Mitchell|first=John F.

It reradiates in all directions, both upwards and downwards; in equilibrium (by definition) the same amount as it has absorbed. This results in more warmth below. Increasing the concentration of the gases increases the amount of absorption and reradiation, and thereby further warms the layers and ultimately the surface below.<ref name=\"IPCC4_ch01\" />\n\nGreenhouse gases\u2014including most diatomic gases with two different atoms (such as carbon monoxide, CO) and all gases with three or more atoms\u2014are able to absorb and emit infrared radiation. Though more than 99% of the dry atmosphere is IR transparent (because the main constituents\u2014{{chem|N|2}}, {{chem|O|2}}, and Ar\u2014are not able to directly absorb or emit infrared radiation), intermolecular collisions cause the energy absorbed and emitted by the greenhouse gases to be shared with the other, non-IR-active, gases.\n\n== Greenhouse gases ==\n{{Main|Greenhouse gas}}\nBy their percentage contribution to the greenhouse effect on Earth the four major gases are:<ref name=\"realclimate.org\">{{cite web| url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=142| date=6 April 2005| title=Water vapour: feedback or forcing?| publisher=RealClimate| accessdate=2006-05-01}}</ref><ref name=\"kiehl197\"/>\n[[File:CO2 H2O absorption atmospheric gases unique pattern energy wavelengths of energy transparent to others.png|thumb|upright=4|Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others.

Outside, the warm air near the surface rises and mixes with cooler air aloft, keeping the temperature lower than inside, where the air continues to heat up because it is confined within the greenhouse. This can be demonstrated by opening a small window near the roof of a greenhouse: the temperature will drop considerably. It was demonstrated experimentally ([[Robert W. Wood|R. W.

This is called the greenhouse effect.\"<br />{{cite book |first=Stephen H. |last=Schneider |chapter=Global Climate Change in the Human Perspective |title=Geosphere-biosphere Interactions and Climate |editor-first=Lennart O. |editor-last=Bengtsson |editor2-first=Claus U. |editor2-last=Hammer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-78238-4 |pages=90\u201391 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsASkmCPDpcC&pg=PA90 }}<br />{{cite book |editor-first=E. |editor-last=Claussen |editor2-first=V.A. |editor2-last=Cochran |editor3-first=D.P. |editor3-last=Davis |title=Climate Change: Science, Strategies, & Solutions |publisher=University of Michigan |year=2001 |page=373 |isbn=9004120246 |chapter=Global Climate Data |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=g85OJ76ufJoC&pg=PA373}}<br />{{cite book |first=A. |last=Allaby |first2=M. |last2=Allaby |title=A Dictionary of Earth Sciences |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-280079-5 |page=244}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=anrev>\n{{cite journal\n | journal = Annual Review of Energy and the Environment\n | title = Water Vapor Feedback and Global Warming\n |first=Isaac M. |last=Held |first2=Brian J. |last2=Soden | volume = 25\n | publisher = Annual Reviews\n | pages = 441\u2013475\n | doi = 10.1146/annurev.energy.25.1.441\n | date = November 2000\n | url = http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.energy.25.1.441\n }}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |last=Businger |first=Joost Alois |author1-link=Joost Businger |author2=Fleagle, Robert Guthrie |title=An introduction to atmospheric physics |publisher=Academic |date=1980 |isbn=0-12-260355-9 |edition=2nd |series=International Geophysics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qgWHwX0IpdAC}}\n* {{cite book |last=Henderson-Sellers |first=Ann |author1-link=Ann Henderson-Sellers |author2=McGuffie, Kendal |title=A climate modelling primer |publisher=Wiley |date=2005 |isbn=0-470-85750-1 |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Hc9Ga8UruEC}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia |last1=Schelling |first1=Thomas C. |authorlink= Thomas Schelling |editorlink=David R.

A more recent trend is to write group homomorphisms on the right of their arguments, omitting brackets, so that ''h''(''x'') becomes simply ''x h''. This approach is especially prevalent in areas of group theory where [[Automata theory|automata]] play a role, since it accords better with the convention that automata read words from left to right.\n\nIn areas of mathematics where one considers groups endowed with additional structure, a ''homomorphism'' sometimes means a map which respects not only the group structure (as above) but also the extra structure. For example, a homomorphism of [[topological group]]s is often required to be continuous.\n\n== Intuition ==\nThe purpose of defining a group homomorphism is to create functions that preserve the algebraic structure. An equivalent definition of group homomorphism is: The function ''h'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''H'' is a group homomorphism if whenever \n\n''a'' \u2217 ''b'' = ''c'' &nbsp; we have &nbsp; ''h''(''a'') \u22c5 ''h''(''b'') = ''h''(''c''). \n\nIn other words, the group ''H'' in some sense has a similar algebraic structure as ''G'' and the homomorphism ''h'' preserves that.\n\n== Types of group homomorphism ==\n;Monomorphism{{anchor|monomorphism}}: A group homomorphism that is [[injective function|injective]] (or, one-to-one); i.e., preserves distinctness.\n;Epimorphism: A group homomorphism that is [[surjective function|surjective]] (or, onto); i.e., reaches every point in the codomain.\n;[[group isomorphism|Isomorphism]]: A group homomorphism that is [[bijection|bijective]]; i.e., injective and surjective. Its inverse is also a group homomorphism. In this case, the groups ''G'' and ''H'' are called ''isomorphic''; they differ only in the notation of their elements and are identical for all practical purposes.\n;[[Endomorphism]]: A homomorphism, ''h'': ''G'' \u2192 ''G''; the domain and codomain are the same. Also called an endomorphism of ''G''.\n;[[Automorphism]]: An endomorphism that is bijective, and hence an isomorphism. The set of all [[automorphism]]s of a group ''G'', with functional composition as operation, forms itself a group, the ''automorphism group'' of ''G''. It is denoted by Aut(''G''). As an example, the automorphism group of ('''Z''', +) contains only two elements, the identity transformation and multiplication with \u22121; it is isomorphic to '''Z'''/2'''Z'''.\n\n== Image and kernel ==\n{{main article|Image (mathematics)|kernel (algebra)}}\nWe define the ''[[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of h'' to be the set of elements in ''G'' which are mapped to the identity in ''H''\n: <math> \\operatorname{ker}(h) \\equiv \\left\\{u \\in G\\colon h(u) = e_{H}\\right\\}.</math>\n\nand the ''[[Image (mathematics)|image]]  of h'' to be\n: <math> \\operatorname{im}(h) \\equiv h(G) \\equiv \\left\\{h(u)\\colon u \\in G\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe kernel and image  of a homomorphism can be interpreted as measuring how close it is to being an isomorphism. The [[isomorphism theorem|first isomorphism theorem]] states that the image of a group homomorphism, ''h''(''G'') is isomorphic to the quotient group ''G''/ker ''h''.\n\nThe kernel of h is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G''  and the image of h is a [[subgroup]] of ''H'':\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  h\\left(g^{-1} \\circ u \\circ g\\right) &= h(g)^{-1} \\cdot h(u) \\cdot h(g) \\\\\n                                       &= h(g)^{-1} \\cdot e_H  \\cdot h(g) \\\\\n                                       &= h(g)^{-1} \\cdot h(g) = e_H.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIf and only if {{nowrap|ker(''h'') {{=}} {''e''<sub>''G''</sub>}}}, the homomorphism, ''h'', is a [[#monomorphism|''group monomorphism'']]; i.e., ''h'' is injective (one-to-one). Injection directly gives that there is a unique element in the kernel, and a unique element in the kernel gives injection:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                  &&                           h(g_1) &= h(g_2) \\\\\n  \\Leftrightarrow &&         h(g_1) \\cdot h(g_2)^{-1} &= e_H \\\\\n  \\Leftrightarrow && h\\left(g_1 \\circ g_2^{-1}\\right) &= e_H,\\  \\operatorname{ker}(h) = \\{e_G\\} \\\\\n  \\Rightarrow     &&               g_1 \\circ g_2^{-1} &= e_G \\\\\n  \\Leftrightarrow &&                              g_1 &= g_2 \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Examples ==\n* Consider the [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''/3'''Z''' = {0, 1, 2} and the group of integers '''Z''' with addition. The map ''h'' : '''Z''' \u2192 '''Z'''/3'''Z''' with ''h''(''u'') = ''u'' [[modular arithmetic|mod]] 3 is a group homomorphism. It is [[surjective]] and its kernel consists of all integers which are divisible by 3.\n{{bulleted list|\nConsider the group\n:<math>G \\equiv \\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix}\n    a & b \\\\\n    0 & 1\n  \\end{pmatrix} \\bigg| a > 0, b \\in \\mathbf{R}\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nFor any complex number ''u'' the function ''f<sub>u</sub>'' : ''G'' \u2192 '''C''' defined by:\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n    a & b \\\\\n    0 & 1\n  \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto a^u\n</math>\n\nis a group homomorphism.\n|\nConsider multiplicative group of [[positive real numbers]] ('''R'''<sup>+</sup>, \u22c5) for any complex number ''u'' the function ''f<sub>u</sub>'' : '''R'''<sup>+</sup> \u2192 '''C''' defined by:\n:<math>f_u(a) = a^u</math>\n\nis a group homomorphism.\n}}\n* The [[exponential function|exponential map]] yields a group homomorphism from the group of [[real number]]s '''R''' with addition to the group of non-zero real numbers '''R'''* with multiplication. The kernel is {0} and the image consists of the positive real numbers.\n* The exponential map also yields a group homomorphism from the group of [[complex number]]s '''C''' with addition to the group of non-zero complex numbers '''C'''* with multiplication. This map is surjective and has the kernel {2\u03c0''ki'' : ''k'' \u2208 '''Z'''}, as can be seen from [[Euler's formula]].  Fields like '''R''' and '''C''' that have homomorphisms from their additive group to their multiplicative group are thus called [[exponential field]]s.\n\n== The category of groups ==\nIf {{nowrap|''h'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''H''}} and {{nowrap|''k'' : ''H'' \u2192 ''K''}} are group homomorphisms, then so is {{nowrap|''k'' \u2218 ''h'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''K''}}. This shows that the class of all groups, together with group homomorphisms as morphisms, forms a [[category theory|category]].\n\n== Homomorphisms of abelian groups ==\nIf ''G'' and ''H'' are [[abelian group|abelian]] (i.e., commutative) groups, then the set {{nowrap|Hom(''G'', ''H'')}} of all group homomorphisms from ''G'' to ''H'' is itself an abelian group: the sum {{nowrap|''h'' + ''k''}} of two homomorphisms is defined by\n:(''h'' + ''k'')(''u'') = ''h''(''u'') + ''k''(''u'')&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for all ''u'' in ''G''.\nThe commutativity of ''H'' is needed to prove that {{nowrap|''h'' + ''k''}} is again a group homomorphism.\n\nThe addition of homomorphisms is compatible with the composition of homomorphisms in the following sense: if ''f'' is in {{nowrap|Hom(''K'', ''G'')}}, ''h'', ''k'' are elements of {{nowrap|Hom(''G'', ''H'')}}, and ''g'' is in {{nowrap|Hom(''H'', ''L'')}}, then \n:{{nowrap|1=(''h'' + ''k'') \u2218 ''f''  =  (''h'' \u2218 ''f'') + (''k'' \u2218 ''f'')}} &nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp; {{nowrap|1=''g'' \u2218 (''h'' + ''k'')  = (''g'' \u2218 ''h'') + (''g'' \u2218 ''k'')}}.\nSince the composition is [[associative]], this shows that the set End(''G'') of all endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a [[ring (algebra)|ring]], the ''[[endomorphism ring]]'' of ''G''. For example, the endomorphism ring of the abelian group consisting of the [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of ''m'' copies of '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' is isomorphic to the ring of ''m''-by-''m'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries in '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''. The above compatibility also shows that the category of all abelian groups with group homomorphisms forms a [[preadditive category]]; the existence of direct sums and well-behaved kernels makes this category the prototypical example of an [[abelian category]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Fundamental theorem on homomorphisms]]\n*[[Ring homomorphism]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n| last1 = Dummit\n| first1 = D.

If there exists an isomorphism between two groups, then the groups are called '''isomorphic'''. From the standpoint of group theory, isomorphic groups have the same properties and need not be distinguished.\n\n== Definition and notation==\n\nGiven two groups (<var>G</var>, \u2217) and (<var>H</var>, <math>\\odot</math>), a ''group isomorphism'' from (<var>G</var>, \u2217) to (<var>H</var>, <math>\\odot</math>) is a [[bijection|bijective]] [[group homomorphism]] from <var>G</var> to <var>H</var>. Spelled out, this means that a group isomorphism is a bijective function <math>f : G \\rightarrow H</math> such that for all <var>u</var> and <var>v</var> in <var>G</var> it holds that\n: <math> f(u * v) = f(u) \\odot f(v)</math>.\n\nThe two groups (<var>G</var>, \u2217) and (<var>H</var>, <math>\\odot</math>) are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism from one to the other. This is written:\n: <math>(G, *) \\cong (H, \\odot)</math>  <!-- the Unicode symbol \u2245 is not visible with all browsers and browser settings -->\n\nOften shorter and simpler notations can be used. When the relevant group operations are unambiguous they are omitted and one writes:\n: <math>G \\cong H</math>\n\nSometimes one can even simply write <var>G</var> = <var>H</var>. Whether such a notation is possible without confusion or ambiguity depends on context. For example, the equals sign is not very suitable when the groups are both subgroups of the same group. See also the examples.\n\nConversely, given a group (<var>G</var>, \u2217), a set <var>H</var>, and a [[bijection]] <math>f : G \\rightarrow H</math>, we can make <var>H</var> a group (<var>H</var>, <math>\\odot</math>) by defining\n: <math>f(u) \\odot f(v) = f(u * v)</math>.\n\nIf <var>H</var> = <var>G</var> and <math>\\odot</math> = \u2217 then the bijection is an automorphism (''q.v.'').\n\nIntuitively, group theorists view two isomorphic groups as follows: For every element ''g'' of a group ''G'', there exists an element ''h'' of ''H'' such that ''h'' 'behaves in the same way' as ''g'' (operates with other elements of the group in the same way as ''g''). For instance, if ''g'' generates ''G'', then so does ''h''. This implies in particular that ''G'' and ''H'' are in bijective correspondence. Thus, the definition of an isomorphism is quite natural.\n\nAn isomorphism of groups may equivalently be defined as an [[invertible]] [[morphism]] in the [[category of groups]], where invertible here means has a two-sided inverse.\n\n== Examples ==\nIn this section some notable examples of isomorphic groups are listed.\n* The group of all [[real number]]s with addition, (<math>\\mathbb{R}</math>,+), is isomorphic to the group of [[positive real numbers]] with multiplication (<math>\\mathbb{R}</math><sup>+</sup>,&times;):\n: <math>(\\mathbb{R}, +) \\cong (\\mathbb{R}^+, \\times)</math> via the isomorphism\n: <math>f(x) = e^x</math> (see [[exponential function]]).\n* The group <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> of [[integer]]s (with addition) is a [[subgroup]] of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>, and the [[factor group]] <math>\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}</math> is isomorphic to the group <math>S^1</math> of [[complex number]]s of [[absolute value]] 1 (with multiplication):\n: <math>\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z} \\cong S^1</math>\n* The [[Klein four-group]] is isomorphic to the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of two copies of <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}</math> (see [[modular arithmetic]]), and can therefore be written <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2</math>. Another notation is Dih<sub>2</sub>, because it is a [[dihedral group]].\n* Generalizing this, for all odd ''n'', Dih<sub>2''n''</sub> is isomorphic with the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of Dih<sub>''n''</sub> and Z<sub>2</sub>.\n* If (''G'', \u2217) is an [[infinite cyclic group]], then (''G'', \u2217) is isomorphic to the integers (with the addition operation). From an algebraic point of view, this means that the set of all integers (with the addition operation) is the 'only' infinite cyclic group.\n\nSome groups can be proven to be isomorphic, relying on the [[axiom of choice]], but the proof does not indicate how to construct a concrete isomorphism. Examples:\n* The group (<math>\\mathbb{R}</math>, +) is isomorphic to the group (<math>\\mathbb{C}</math>, +) of all [[complex number]]s with addition.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Ash|year=1973 |title=A Consequence of the Axiom of Choice |journal=Journal of the Australian Mathematical Society |volume=19 |pages=306\u2013308 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FJAZ%2FJAZ1_19_03%2FS1446788700031505a.pdf&code=d2e5b0d7bbbbe7368eb4aa14d4bda045 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n* The group (<math>\\mathbb{C}</math><sup>*</sup>, \u00b7) of non-zero complex numbers with multiplication as operation is isomorphic to the group ''S''<sup>1</sup> mentioned above.\n\n==Properties==\n\nThe [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of an isomorphism from (''G'', \u2217) to (''H'', <math>\\odot</math>), is always {e<sub>G</sub>} where e<sub>G</sub> is the identity of the group (''G'', \u2217)\n\nIf (''G'', \u2217) is isomorphic to (''H'',<math>\\odot</math>), and if ''G'' is [[abelian group|abelian]] then so is ''H''.\n\nIf (''G'', \u2217) is a group that is isomorphic to (''H'', <math>\\odot</math>) [where ''f'' is the isomorphism], then if ''a'' belongs to ''G'' and has [[order (group theory)|order]] ''n'', then so does ''f(a)''.\n\nIf (''G'', \u2217) is a [[locally finite group]] that is isomorphic to (''H'',  <math>\\odot</math>), then (''H'', <math>\\odot</math>) is also locally finite. \n\nThe number of distinct groups (when isomorphic groups are considered equal) of order <math>n</math> is given by sequence A000001 in [[OEIS]]. The first few numbers are 0, 1, 1, 1 and 2 meaning that 4 is the lowest order with more than one group.\n\n== Cyclic groups ==\nAll cyclic groups of a given order are isomorphic to <math>(\\mathbb{Z}_n, +_n)</math>.\n\nLet ''G'' be a cyclic group and ''n'' be the order of ''G''. ''G'' is then the group generated by <math>\\langle x\\rangle=\\{e,x,...,x^{n-1}\\}</math>. \nWe will show that\n: <math>G \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_n, +_n)</math>\n\nDefine \n: <math>\\varphi : G \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_n=\\{0,1,...,n-1 \\}</math>, so that <math>\\varphi(x^a)=a</math>. Clearly, <math>\\varphi</math> is bijective. \nThen\n: <math>\\varphi(x^a \\cdot x^b) = \\varphi(x^{a+b}) = a+b = \\varphi(x^a)+_n \\varphi(x^b)</math>, which proves that <math>G \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_n, +_n)</math>.\n\n== Consequences ==\n\nFrom the definition, it follows that any isomorphism <math>f : G \\rightarrow H</math> will map the identity element of <var>G</var> to the identity element of <var>H</var>, \n: <math>f(e_G) = e_H</math>\nthat it will map inverses to inverses,\n: <math>f(u^{-1}) = \\left[ f(u) \\right]^{-1}</math>\nand more generally, ''n''th powers to ''n''th powers,\n: <math>f(u^n)= \\left[ f(u) \\right]^n </math>\nfor all <var>u</var> in <var>G</var>,\nand that the inverse map <math>f^{-1} : H \\rightarrow G</math> is also a group isomorphism.\n\nThe relation \"being isomorphic\" satisfies all the axioms of an [[equivalence relation]]. If <var>f</var> is an isomorphism between two groups <var>G</var> and <var>H</var>, then everything that is true about <var>G</var> that is only related to the group structure can be translated via <var>f</var> into a true ditto statement about <var>H</var>, and vice versa.\n\n== Automorphisms ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Abelian group]] -->\n\nAn isomorphism from a group (<var>G</var>, \u2217) to itself is called an [[automorphism]] of this group. Thus it is a bijection <math>f : G \\rightarrow G</math> such that\n: <math>f(u) * f(v) = f(u * v)</math>.\n\nAn automorphism always maps the identity to itself. The image under an automorphism of a [[conjugacy class]] is always a conjugacy class (the same or another). The image of an element has the same order as that element.\n\nThe composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism, and with this operation the set of all automorphisms of a group <var>G</var>, denoted by Aut(<var>G</var>), forms itself a group, the ''automorphism group'' of <var>G</var>.\n\nFor all abelian groups there is at least the automorphism that replaces the group elements by their inverses. However, in groups where all elements are equal to their inverse this is the trivial automorphism, e.g. in the [[Klein four-group]]. For that group all permutations of the three non-identity elements are automorphisms, so the automorphism group is isomorphic to <var>S</var><sub>3</sub> and Dih<sub>3</sub>.\n\nIn Z<sub><var>p</var></sub> for a prime number <var>p</var>, one non-identity element can be replaced by any other, with corresponding changes in the other elements. The automorphism group is isomorphic to {{nowrap|Z<sub><var>p</var> \u2212 1</sub>}}. For example, for {{nowrap|1=<var>n</var> = 7}}, multiplying all elements of Z<sub>7</sub> by 3, modulo 7, is an automorphism of order 6 in the automorphism group, because {{nowrap|3<sup>6</sup> \u2261 1 (modulo 7)}}, while lower powers do not give 1. Thus this automorphism generates Z<sub>6</sub>. There is one more automorphism with this property: multiplying all elements of Z<sub>7</sub> by 5, modulo 7. Therefore, these two correspond to the elements 1 and 5 of Z<sub>6</sub>, in that order or conversely.\n\nThe automorphism group of Z<sub>6</sub> is isomorphic to Z<sub>2</sub>, because only each of the two elements 1 and 5 generate Z<sub>6</sub>, so apart from the identity we can only interchange these.\n\nThe automorphism group of {{nowrap|1=Z<sub>2</sub> \u2295 Z<sub>2</sub> \u2295 Z<sub>2</sub> = Dih<sub>2</sub> \u2295 Z<sub>2</sub>}} has order 168, as can be found as follows. All 7 non-identity elements play the same role, so we can choose which plays the role of (1,0,0). Any of the remaining 6 can be chosen to play the role of (0,1,0). This determines which corresponds to (1,1,0). For (0,0,1) we can choose from 4, which determines the rest. Thus we have {{nowrap|1=7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 4 = 168}} automorphisms.

In 1854 [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] determined the source of a [[cholera]] outbreak in [[London]] by marking points on a map depicting where the cholera victims lived, and connecting the cluster that he found with a nearby water source. This was one of the earliest successful uses of a geographic methodology in epidemiology. While the basic elements of [[topography]] and theme existed previously in [[cartography]], the John Snow map was unique, using cartographic methods not only to depict but also to analyze clusters of geographically dependent phenomena.\n\nThe early&nbsp;20th&nbsp;century saw the development of [[photozincography]], which allowed maps to be split into layers, for example one layer for vegetation and another for water. This was particularly used for printing contours&nbsp;\u2013 drawing these was a labour-intensive task but having them on a separate layer meant they could be worked on without the other layers to confuse the [[draughtsman]]. This work was originally drawn on glass plates but later [[plastic film]] was introduced, with the advantages of being lighter, using less storage space and being less brittle, among others. When all the layers were finished, they were combined into one image using a large process camera. Once color printing came in, the layers idea was also used for creating separate printing plates for each color. While the use of layers much later became one of the main typical features of a contemporary GIS, the photographic process just described is not considered to be a GIS in itself&nbsp;\u2013 as the maps were just images with no database to link them to.\n\n[[Computer hardware]] development spurred by [[nuclear weapon]] research led to general-purpose computer \"mapping\" applications by the early 1960s.<ref name=\"map_printing_methods\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.broward.org/library/bienes/lii14009.htm\n  |title=Map Printing Methods\n  |first=Joseph H.  |last=Fitzgerald\n  |accessdate=2007-06-09\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070604194024/http://www.broward.org/library/bienes/lii14009.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-04}}</ref>\n\nThe year 1960 saw the development of the world's first true operational GIS in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, by the federal Department of Forestry and Rural Development. Developed by Dr. [[Roger Tomlinson]], it was called the [[Canada Geographic Information System]]&nbsp;(CGIS) and was used to store, analyze, and manipulate data collected for the [[Canada Land Inventory]]&nbsp;\u2013 an effort to determine the land capability for rural Canada by mapping information about [[soil]]s, agriculture, recreation, wildlife, [[waterfowl]], [[forestry]] and land use at a scale of 1:50,000. A rating classification factor was also added to permit analysis.\n\nCGIS was an improvement over \"computer mapping\" applications as it provided capabilities for overlay, measurement, and [[digitizing]]/scanning. It supported a national coordinate system that spanned the continent, coded lines as [[Directed edge|arcs]] having a true embedded [[topology]] and it stored the attribute and locational information in separate files. As a result of this, Tomlinson has become known as the \"father of GIS\", particularly for his use of overlays in promoting the spatial analysis of convergent geographic data.<ref name=\"Tomlinson\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.urisa.org/node/395\n |title=GIS Hall of Fame&nbsp;\u2013 Roger Tomlinson\n |publisher=URISA\n |accessdate=2007-06-09\n |deadurl=yes\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714083049/http://www.urisa.org/node/395\n |archivedate=2007-07-14\n |df=\n}}</ref>\n\nCGIS lasted into the 1990s and built a large digital land resource database in Canada.

The most common method of data creation is [[Digitizing|digitization]], where a [[hard copy]] map or survey plan is transferred into a digital medium through the use of a CAD program, and geo-referencing capabilities. With the wide availability of [[Orthophoto|ortho-rectified imagery]] (from satellites, aircraft, Helikites and UAVs), heads-up digitizing is becoming the main avenue through which geographic data is extracted. Heads-up digitizing involves the tracing of geographic data directly on top of the aerial imagery instead of by the traditional method of tracing the geographic form on a separate [[Graphics tablet|digitizing tablet]] (heads-down digitizing).{{clarify|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Relating information from different sources===\nGIS uses spatio-temporal ([[space-time]]) location as the key index variable for all other information. Just as a relational database containing text or numbers can relate many different tables using common key index variables, GIS can relate otherwise unrelated information by using location as the key index variable. The key is the location and/or extent in space-time.\n\nAny variable that can be located spatially, and increasingly also temporally, can be referenced using a GIS. Locations or extents in Earth space\u2013time may be recorded as dates/times of occurrence, and x, y, and z [[coordinate]]s representing, [[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[elevation (geography)|elevation]], respectively. These GIS coordinates may represent other quantified systems of temporo-spatial reference (for example, film frame number, stream gage station, highway mile-marker, surveyor benchmark, building address, street intersection, entrance gate, water depth sounding, [[Point of sale|POS]] or [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawing origin/units). Units applied to recorded temporal-spatial data can vary widely (even when using exactly the same data, see [[map projection]]s), but all Earth-based spatial\u2013temporal location and extent references should, ideally, be relatable to one another and ultimately to a \"real\" physical location or extent in space\u2013time.\n\nRelated by accurate spatial information, an incredible variety of real-world and projected past or future data can be analyzed, interpreted and represented.<ref>Cowen 1988 \"GIS VERSUS CAD VERSUS DBMS: WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES ?\" ''PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING & REMOTE SENSING'' Vol. 54, No.11, November 1988, pp. 1551\u20131555. {{cite web |url=http://funk.on.br/esantos/doutorado/GEO/igce/DBMS.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424091317/http://funk.on.br/esantos/doutorado/GEO/igce/DBMS.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-24 |df= }} last retrieved 9/17/2010.</ref> This key characteristic of GIS has begun to open new avenues of scientific inquiry into behaviors and patterns of real-world information that previously had not been systematically [[correlation|correlated]].\n\n===GIS uncertainties===\nGIS accuracy depends upon source data, and how it is encoded to be data referenced.

The scale of a map and geographical rendering area representation type{{clarify|date=August 2014}}<!--[[Map projection]]?--> are very important aspects since the information content depends mainly on the scale set and resulting locatability of the map's representations. In order to digitize a map, the map has to be checked within theoretical dimensions, then scanned into a raster format, and resulting raster data has to be given a theoretical dimension by a [[rubber]] sheeting/warping technology process.\n\nA quantitative analysis of maps brings accuracy issues into focus. The electronic and other equipment used to make measurements for GIS is far more precise than the machines of conventional map analysis. All geographical data are inherently inaccurate, and these inaccuracies will propagate through GIS&nbsp;operations in ways that are difficult to predict.\n\n===Data representation===\n{{Main|GIS file formats}}\nGIS data represents real objects (such as roads, land use, elevation, trees, waterways, etc.) with digital data determining the mix. Real objects can be divided into two abstractions: discrete objects (e.g., a house) and continuous fields (such as rainfall amount, or elevations). Traditionally, there are two broad methods used to store data in a GIS for both kinds of abstractions mapping references: [[raster images]] and [[Vector graphics|vector]]. Points, lines, and polygons are the stuff of mapped location attribute references. A new hybrid method of storing data is that of identifying point clouds, which combine three-dimensional points with [[RGB]] information at each point, returning a \"[[Anaglyph 3D|3D color image]]\". GIS thematic maps then are becoming more and more realistically visually descriptive of what they set out to show or determine.\n\nFor a list of popular GIS file formats, such as [[shapefile]]s, see {{section link|GIS file formats|Popular GIS file formats}}.\n\n===Data capture===\n[[File:Field-Map birdie.jpg|thumb|right|Example of hardware for mapping ([[GPS]] and [[laser rangefinder]]) and data collection ([[rugged computer]]). The current trend for geographical information system (GIS) is that accurate mapping and data analysis are completed while in the field. Depicted hardware ([[field-map]] technology) is used mainly for [[forest inventory|forest inventories]], monitoring and mapping.]]\nData capture\u2014entering information into the system\u2014consumes much of the time of GIS&nbsp;practitioners. There are a variety of methods used to enter data into a GIS where it is stored in a digital format.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Song|first=Yongze|author2=Xiangyu Wang|title=Trends and Opportunities of BIM-GIS Integration in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industry: A Review from a Spatio-Temporal Statistical Perspective|journal=ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf.|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/12/397}}</ref>\n\nExisting data printed on paper or [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] maps can be [[digitizer|digitized]] or scanned to produce digital data. A digitizer produces [[Vector graphics|vector]] data as an operator traces points, lines, and polygon boundaries from a map. [[Image scanner|Scanning]] a map results in raster data that could be further processed to produce vector data.\n\n[[Surveying|Survey]] data can be directly entered into a GIS from digital data collection systems on survey instruments using a technique called [[Analytic geometry|coordinate geometry (COGO)]]. Positions from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) like [[Global Positioning System]] can also be collected and then imported into a GIS. A current trend in data collection gives users the ability to utilize [[Rugged computer|field computers]] with the ability to edit live data using wireless connections or disconnected editing sessions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|last2=Hiscock|first2=Peter|last3=Sullivan|first3=Marjorie|last4=Hughes|first4=Philip|title=Landform boundary effects on Holocene forager landscape use in arid South Australia|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|date=July 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.07.004|url=https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/V2MS9}}</ref> This has been enhanced by the availability of low-cost mapping-grade GPS units with decimeter accuracy in real time. This eliminates the need to post process, import, and update the data in the office after fieldwork has been collected. This includes the ability to incorporate positions collected using a [[laser rangefinder]]. New technologies also allow users to create maps as well as analysis directly in the field, making projects more efficient and mapping more accurate.\n\n[[Remote sensing|Remotely sensed]] data also plays an important role in data collection and consist of sensors attached to a platform. Sensors include cameras, digital scanners and [[lidar]], while platforms usually consist of aircraft and [[satellite]]s. In England in the mid 1990s, hybrid kite/balloons called [[Allsopp Helikite|helikites]] first pioneered the use of compact airborne digital cameras as airborne geo-information systems. Aircraft measurement software, accurate to 0.4&nbsp;mm was used to link the photographs and measure the ground. Helikites are inexpensive and gather more accurate data than aircraft. Helikites can be used over roads, railways and towns where [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) are banned.\n\nRecently aerial data collection is becoming possible with [[miniature UAV]]s. For example, the [[Aeryon Scout]] was used to map a 50-acre&nbsp;area with a [[ground sample distance]] of {{convert|1|in|cm|2}} in only 12&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeryon.com/news/pressreleases/248-softwareversion5.html|title=Aeryon Announces Version 5 of the Aeryon Scout System &#124; Aeryon Labs Inc |publisher=Aeryon.com |date=2011-07-06 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of digital data currently comes from [[photo interpretation]] of aerial photographs. Soft-copy workstations are used to digitize features directly from [[Stereoscopy|stereo pairs]] of digital photographs. These systems allow data to be captured in two and three dimensions, with elevations measured directly from a stereo pair using principles of [[photogrammetry]]. Analog aerial photos must be scanned before being entered into a soft-copy system, for high-quality digital cameras this step is skipped.\n\nSatellite [[remote sensing]] provides another important source of spatial data. Here satellites use different sensor packages to passively measure the reflectance from parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] or radio waves that were sent out from an active sensor such as radar. Remote sensing collects raster data that can be further processed using different bands to identify objects and classes of interest, such as land cover.\n\nWhen data is captured, the user should consider if the data should be captured with either a relative accuracy or absolute accuracy, since this could not only influence how information will be interpreted but also the cost of data capture.\n\nAfter entering data into a GIS, the data usually requires editing, to remove errors, or further processing. For vector data it must be made \"topologically correct\" before it can be used for some advanced analysis. For example, in a road network, lines must connect with nodes at an intersection. Errors such as undershoots and overshoots must also be removed. For scanned maps, blemishes on the source map may need to be removed from the resulting [[Raster graphics|raster]]. For example, a fleck of dirt might connect two lines that should not be connected.\n\n===Raster-to-vector translation===\nData restructuring can be performed by a GIS to convert data into different formats. For example, a GIS may be used to convert a satellite image map to a vector structure by generating lines around all cells with the same classification, while determining the cell spatial relationships, such as adjacency or inclusion.\n\nMore advanced data processing can occur with [[image processing]], a technique developed in the late&nbsp;1960s by [[NASA]] and the private sector to provide contrast enhancement, false color rendering and a variety of other techniques including use of two dimensional [[Fourier transforms]]. Since digital data is collected and stored in various ways, the two data sources may not be entirely compatible. So a GIS must be able to convert [[geographic data]] from one structure to another. In so doing, the implicit assumptions behind different ontologies and classifications require analysis.<ref>Winther, Rasmus G. (2014) \"Mapping Kinds in GIS and Cartography\" in ''Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice'', edited by C. Kendig http://philpapers.org/archive/WINMKI.pdf</ref> Object ontologies have gained increasing prominence as a consequence of [[object-oriented programming]] and sustained work by [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]] and co-workers.\n\n===Projections, coordinate systems, and registration===\n{{Main|Map projection}}\nThe earth can be represented by various models, each of which may provide a different set of coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude, elevation) for any given point on the Earth's surface. The simplest model is to assume the earth is a perfect sphere. As more measurements of the earth have accumulated, the models of the earth have become more sophisticated and more accurate. In fact, there are models called [[datum (geodesy)|datums]] that apply to different areas of the earth to provide increased accuracy, like [[NAD83]] for U.S. measurements, and the [[World Geodetic System]] for worldwide measurements.\n\n==Spatial analysis with geographical information system (GIS){{anchor|Spatial analysis}}==\n{{further|Spatial analysis}}\n\nGIS spatial analysis is a rapidly changing field, and GIS packages are increasingly including analytical tools as standard built-in facilities, as optional toolsets, as add-ins or 'analysts'. In many instances these are provided by the original software suppliers (commercial vendors or collaborative non commercial development teams), while in other cases facilities have been developed and are provided by third parties. Furthermore, many products offer software development kits (SDKs), programming languages and language support, scripting facilities and/or special interfaces for developing one's own analytical tools or variants. The increased availability has created a new dimension to [[business intelligence]] termed \"[[Spatial intelligence (business method)|spatial intelligence]]\" which, when openly delivered via intranet, democratizes access to geographic and social network data. [[Geospatial intelligence]], based on GIS spatial analysis, has also become a key element for security. GIS as a whole can be described as conversion to a vectorial representation or to any other digitisation process.\n\n===Slope and aspect===\n[[Grade (slope)|Slope]] can be defined as the steepness or gradient of a unit of terrain, usually measured as an angle in degrees or as a percentage. [[Aspect (geography)|Aspect]] can be defined as the direction in which a unit of terrain faces. Aspect is usually expressed in degrees from north. Slope, aspect, and surface curvature in terrain analysis are all derived from neighborhood operations using elevation values of a cell's adjacent neighbours.<ref name=\"Chang\">{{cite book\n  |author=Chang, K.

A GIS, however, can be used to depict two- and three-dimensional characteristics of the Earth's surface, subsurface, and atmosphere from information points. For example, a GIS can quickly generate a map with [[isopleth]] or [[contour line]]s that indicate differing amounts of rainfall. Such a map can be thought of as a rainfall contour map. Many sophisticated methods can estimate the characteristics of surfaces from a limited number of point measurements. A two-dimensional contour map created from the surface modeling of rainfall point measurements may be overlaid and analyzed with any other map in a GIS covering the same area. This GIS derived map can then provide additional information - such as the viability of [[water power]] potential as a [[renewable energy]] source. Similarly, GIS can be used to compare other [[renewable energy]] resources to find the best geographic potential for a region.<ref>K. Calvert, J. M. Pearce, W.E. Mabee, \"Toward renewable energy geo-information infrastructures: Applications of GIScience and remote sensing that can build institutional capacity\" ''Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews'' '''18''', pp. 416\u2013429 (2013). [https://www.academia.edu/2180165/Toward_renewable_energy_geo-information_infrastructures_Applications_of_GIScience_and_remote_sensing_that_build_institutional_capacity open access]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, from a series of three-dimensional points, or [[digital elevation model]], isopleth lines representing elevation contours can be generated, along with slope analysis, [[shaded relief]], and other elevation products. Watersheds can be easily defined for any given reach, by computing all of the areas contiguous and uphill from any given point of interest. Similarly, an expected [[thalweg]] of where surface water would want to travel in intermittent and permanent streams can be computed from elevation data in the GIS.\n\n===Topological modeling===\nA GIS can recognize and analyze the spatial relationships that exist within digitally stored spatial data. These [[topological]] relationships allow complex spatial modelling and analysis to be performed. Topological relationships between geometric entities traditionally include adjacency (what adjoins what), containment (what encloses what), and proximity (how close something is to something else).\n\n===Geometric networks===\n[[Geometric networks]] are linear networks of objects that can be used to represent interconnected features, and to perform special spatial analysis on them. A geometric network is composed of edges, which are connected at junction points, similar to [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] in mathematics and computer science. Just like graphs, networks can have weight and flow assigned to its edges, which can be used to represent various interconnected features more accurately. Geometric networks are often used to model road networks and [[public utility]] networks, such as electric, gas, and water networks. Network modeling is also commonly employed in [[transportation planning]], [[hydrology]] modeling, and [[infrastructure]] modeling.\n\n===Hydrological modeling===\nGIS hydrological models can provide a spatial element that other hydrological models lack, with the analysis of variables such as slope, aspect and watershed or [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]].<ref name=\"Heywood\">{{cite book\n  |vauthors=Heywood I, Cornelius S, Carver S\n  |year=2006\n  |title=An Introduction to Geographical Information Systems\n  |publisher=Prentice Hall\n  |place=Essex, England\n  |edition = 3rd\n}}</ref> Terrain analysis is fundamental to hydrology, since water always flows down a slope.<ref name=\"Heywood\" /> As basic terrain analysis of a [[digital elevation model|digital elevation model (DEM)]] involves calculation of slope and aspect, DEMs are very useful for hydrological analysis. Slope and aspect can then be used to determine direction of surface runoff, and hence flow accumulation for the formation of streams, rivers and lakes. Areas of divergent flow can also give a clear indication of the boundaries of a catchment. Once a flow direction and accumulation matrix has been created, queries can be performed that show contributing or dispersal areas at a certain point.<ref name=\"Heywood\" /> More detail can be added to the model, such as terrain roughness, vegetation types and soil types, which can influence infiltration and evapotranspiration rates, and hence influencing surface flow. One of the main uses of hydrological modeling is in [[GIS in Environmental Contamination|environmental contamination research]]. Other applications of hydrological modeling include [[GIS and hydrology|groundwater and surface water mapping]], as well as flood risk maps.\n\n===Cartographic modeling===\n[[File:gislayers.jpg|300px|right|thumb| An example of use of layers in a GIS application. In this example, the forest-cover layer (light green) forms the bottom layer, with the topographic layer (contour lines) over it. Next up is a standing water layer (pond, lake) and then a flowing water layer (stream, river), followed by the boundary layer and finally the road layer on top. The order is very important in order to properly display the final result. Note that the ponds are layered under the streams, so that a stream line can be seen overlying one of the ponds.]]\n\n[[Dana Tomlin]] probably coined the term \"cartographic modeling\" in his PhD dissertation (1983); he later used it in the title of his book, ''Geographic Information Systems and Cartographic Modeling'' (1990).<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Tomlin\n| first1                = C.

Tomlin used raster layers, but the overlay method (see below) can be used more generally. Operations on map layers can be combined into algorithms, and eventually into simulation or optimization models.\n\n===Map overlay===\nThe combination of several spatial datasets (points, lines, or [[polygons]]) creates a new output vector dataset, visually similar to stacking several maps of the same region. These overlays are similar to mathematical [[Venn diagram]] overlays. A [[union (set theory)|union]] overlay combines the geographic features and attribute tables of both inputs into a single new output. An [[intersection (set theory)|intersect]] overlay defines the area where both inputs overlap and retains a set of attribute fields for each. A [[symmetric difference]] overlay defines an output area that includes the total area of both inputs except for the overlapping area.\n\nData extraction is a GIS process similar to vector overlay, though it can be used in either vector or raster data analysis. Rather than combining the properties and features of both datasets, data extraction involves using a \"clip\" or \"mask\" to extract the features of one data set that fall within the spatial extent of another dataset.\n\nIn raster data analysis, the overlay of datasets is accomplished through a process known as \"local operation on multiple rasters\" or \"[[map algebra]]\", through a function that combines the values of each raster's [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. This function may weigh some inputs more than others through use of an \"index model\" that reflects the influence of various factors upon a geographic phenomenon.\n\n===Geostatistics===\n{{Main|Geostatistics}}\n\n[[Geostatistics]] is a branch of statistics that deals with field data, spatial data with a continuous index. It provides methods to model spatial correlation, and predict values at arbitrary locations (interpolation).\n\nWhen phenomena are measured, the observation methods dictate the accuracy of any subsequent analysis. Due to the nature of the data (e.g. traffic patterns in an urban environment; weather patterns over the [[Pacific Ocean]]), a constant or dynamic degree of precision is always lost in the measurement. This loss of precision is determined from the scale and distribution of the data collection.\n\nTo determine the statistical relevance of the analysis, an average is determined so that points (gradients) outside of any immediate measurement can be included to determine their predicted behavior. This is due to the limitations of the applied statistic and data collection methods, and interpolation is required to predict the behavior of particles, points, and locations that are not directly measurable.\n\n[[File:Dem.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hillshade model derived from a [[Digital Elevation Model]] of the Valestra area in the northern Apennines (Italy)]][[Interpolation]] is the process by which a surface is created, usually a raster dataset, through the input of data collected at a number of sample points. There are several forms of interpolation, each which treats the data differently, depending on the properties of the data set. In comparing interpolation methods, the first consideration should be whether or not the source data will change (exact or approximate). Next is whether the method is subjective, a human interpretation, or objective. Then there is the nature of transitions between points: are they abrupt or gradual. Finally, there is whether a method is global (it uses the entire data set to form the model), or local where an algorithm is repeated for a small section of terrain.\n\nInterpolation is a justified measurement because of a spatial autocorrelation principle that recognizes that data collected at any position will have a great similarity to, or influence of those locations within its immediate vicinity.\n\n[[Digital elevation model]]s, [[triangulated irregular network]]s, edge-finding algorithms, [[Thiessen polygons]], [[Fourier analysis]], [[Weighted moving average|(weighted) moving averages]], [[inverse distance weighting]], [[kriging]], [[Spline (mathematics)|spline]], and [[Trend estimation|trend surface analysis]] are all mathematical methods to produce interpolative data.\n\n===Address geocoding===\n{{Main|Geocoding}}\nGeocoding is interpolating spatial locations (X,Y coordinates) from street addresses or any other spatially referenced data such as [[ZIP&nbsp;Code]]s, parcel lots and address locations. A reference theme is required to [[Geocoding|geocode]] individual addresses, such as a road centerline file with address ranges. The individual address locations have historically been interpolated, or estimated, by examining address ranges along a road segment. These are usually provided in the form of a table or database. The software will then place a dot approximately where that address belongs along the segment of centerline. For example, an address point of 500 will be at the midpoint of a line segment that starts with address&nbsp;1 and ends with address&nbsp;1,000. Geocoding can also be applied against actual parcel data, typically from municipal tax maps. In this case, the result of the geocoding will be an actually positioned space as opposed to an interpolated point. This approach is being increasingly used to provide more precise location information.\n\n===Reverse geocoding===\nReverse geocoding is the process of returning an estimated [[street address]] number as it relates to a given coordinate. For example, a user can click on a road centerline theme (thus providing a coordinate) and have information returned that reflects the estimated house number. This house number is interpolated from a range assigned to that road segment. If the user clicks at the [[midpoint]] of a segment that starts with address&nbsp;1 and ends with&nbsp;100, the returned value will be somewhere near 50. Note that reverse geocoding does not return actual addresses, only estimates of what should be there based on the predetermined range.\n\n===Multi-criteria decision analysis===\nCoupled with GIS, [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] methods support decision-makers in analysing a set of alternative spatial solutions, such as the most likely ecological habitat for restoration, against multiple criteria, such as vegetation cover or roads. MCDA uses decision rules to aggregate the criteria, which allows the alternative solutions to be ranked or prioritised.<ref name='Greene'>{{cite journal | last1 = Greene | first1 = R. | last2 = Devillers | first2 = R. | last3 = Luther | first3 = J.E. | last4 = Eddy | first4 = B.G. | title = GIS-based multi-criteria analysis | journal = Geography Compass | year = 2011 | volume = 5/6 | pages = 412\u2013432 }}</ref> GIS MCDA may reduce costs and time involved in identifying potential restoration sites.\n\n===Data output and cartography===\n[[Cartography]] is the design and production of maps, or visual representations of spatial data. The vast majority of modern cartography is done with the help of computers, usually using GIS but production of quality cartography is also achieved by importing layers into a design program to refine it. Most GIS&nbsp;software gives the user substantial control over the appearance of the data.\n\nCartographic work serves two major functions:\n\nFirst, it produces graphics on the screen or on paper that convey the results of analysis to the people who make decisions about resources. Wall maps and other graphics can be generated, allowing the viewer to visualize and thereby understand the results of analyses or simulations of potential events. [[Web Map Server]]s facilitate distribution of generated maps through web browsers using various implementations of web-based application programming interfaces ([[AJAX]], [[Java programming|Java]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], etc.).\n\nSecond, other database information can be generated for further analysis or use. An example would be a list of all addresses within one&nbsp;mile (1.6&nbsp;km) of a toxic spill.\n\n===Graphic display techniques===\nTraditional maps are abstractions of the real world, a sampling of important elements portrayed on a sheet of paper with symbols to represent physical objects. People who use maps must interpret these symbols. [[Topographic map]]s show the shape of land surface with [[contour line]]s or with [[Cartographic relief depiction|shaded relief]].\n\nToday, graphic display techniques such as [[shading]] based on [[altitude]] in a GIS can make relationships among map elements visible, heightening one's ability to extract and analyze information. For example, two types of data were combined in a GIS to produce a perspective view of a portion of [[San&nbsp;Mateo County]], [[California]].\n*The [[digital elevation model]], consisting of surface elevations recorded on a 30-meter horizontal grid, shows high elevations as white and low elevation as black.\n*The accompanying [[Landsat]] Thematic Mapper image shows a false-color infrared image looking down at the same area in 30-meter&nbsp;pixels, or picture elements, for the same coordinate points, pixel&nbsp;by&nbsp;pixel, as the elevation information.\n\nA GIS was used to register and combine the two images to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the three-dimensional [[perspective view]] looking down the [[San Andreas Fault]], using the Thematic Mapper image pixels, but shaded using the elevation of the [[landform]]s. The GIS&nbsp;display depends on the viewing point of the [[observation|observer]] and time of day of the display, to properly render the shadows created by the sun's rays at that latitude, longitude, and time of day.\n\nAn archeochrome is a new way of displaying spatial data. It is a thematic on a 3D&nbsp;map that is applied to a specific building or a part of a building. It is suited to the visual display of heat-loss data.\n\n===Spatial ETL===\n[[Spatial ETL]] tools provide the data processing functionality of traditional [[extract, transform, load]]&nbsp;(ETL) software, but with a primary focus on the ability to manage spatial data. They provide GIS&nbsp;users with the ability to translate data between different standards and proprietary formats, whilst geometrically transforming the data en route. These tools can come in the form of add-ins to existing wider-purpose software such as [[spreadsheet]]s.\n\n===GIS data mining===\nGIS or spatial [[data mining]] is the application of data mining methods to spatial data. Data mining, which is the partially automated search for hidden patterns in large databases, offers great potential benefits for applied GIS-based&nbsp;decision&nbsp;making. Typical applications include environmental monitoring. A characteristic of such applications is that spatial correlation between data measurements require the use of specialized algorithms for more efficient data analysis.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Guo | first2 = Y. | last3 = Tian | first3 = X. | last4 = Ghanem | first4 = M. | title = Distributed Clustering-Based Aggregation Algorithm for Spatial Correlated Sensor Networks | doi = 10.1109/JSEN.2010.2056916 | journal = IEEE Sensors Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | page = 641 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://www.inf.ufpr.br/carmem/oficinaBD/artigos1s2014/dist-clustering.pdf | bibcode = 2011ISenJ..11..641M }}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe implementation of a GIS is often driven by jurisdictional (such as a city), purpose, or application requirements. Generally, a GIS implementation may be custom-designed for an organization.

GIS&nbsp;technology gives researchers the ability to examine the variations in Earth processes over days, months, and years. As an example, the changes in vegetation vigor through a growing season can be animated to determine when drought was most extensive in a particular region. The resulting graphic represents a rough measure of plant health. Working with two variables over time would then allow researchers to detect regional differences in the lag between a decline in rainfall and its effect on vegetation.\n\nGIS&nbsp;technology and the availability of digital data on regional and global scales enable such analyses. The satellite sensor output used to generate a vegetation graphic is produced for example by the [[advanced very-high-resolution radiometer]] (AVHRR). This sensor system detects the amounts of energy reflected from the Earth's surface across various bands of the spectrum for surface areas of about 1 square kilometer. The satellite sensor produces images of a particular location on the Earth twice a day. AVHRR and more recently the [[moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer]] (MODIS) are only two of many sensor systems used for Earth surface analysis.\n\nIn addition to the integration of time in environmental studies, GIS is also being explored for its ability to track and model the progress of humans throughout their daily routines. A concrete example of progress in this area is the recent release of time-specific population data by the [[U.S.&nbsp;Census]]. In this data set, the populations of cities are shown for daytime and evening hours highlighting the pattern of concentration and dispersion generated by North American commuting patterns. The manipulation and generation of data required to produce this data would not have been possible without&nbsp;GIS.\n\nUsing models to project the data held by a GIS&nbsp;forward in time have enabled planners to test policy decisions using [[spatial decision support system]]s.\n\n==Semantics==\nTools and technologies emerging from the [[World Wide Web Consortium]]'s [[Semantic Web]] are proving useful for [[data integration]] problems in information systems.

This in turn allows a GIS to focus on the intended meaning of data rather than its syntax or structure. For example, [[reasoning]] that a land cover type classified as ''deciduous needleleaf trees'' in one dataset is a [[specialization (logic)|specialization]] or subset of land cover type ''forest'' in another more roughly classified dataset can help a GIS automatically merge the two datasets under the more general land cover classification.

A graph in this context is made up of ''[[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]'', ''nodes'', or ''points'' which are connected by ''[[Glossary of graph theory terms#edge|edges]]'', ''arcs'', or ''lines''. A graph may be ''undirected'', meaning that there is no distinction between the two vertices associated with each edge, or its edges may be ''[[Directed graph|directed]]'' from one vertex to another; see [[Graph (discrete mathematics)]] for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graph that are commonly considered. Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in [[discrete mathematics]].\n\nRefer to the [[glossary of graph theory]] for basic definitions in graph theory.\n\n==Definitions==\nDefinitions in graph theory vary. The following are some of the more basic ways of defining graphs and related mathematical structures.\n\n===Graph===\nIn the most common sense of the term,<ref>See, for instance, Iyanaga and Kawada, '''69 J''', p.&nbsp;234 or Biggs, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> a '''graph''' is an [[ordered pair]] {{nobreak|1=''G'' = (''V'', ''E'')}} comprising a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''V'' of ''vertices'' or ''nodes'' or ''points'' together with a set ''E'' of ''edges'' or ''arcs'' or ''lines'', which are 2-element subsets of ''V'' (i.e. an edge is associated with two vertices, and that association takes the form of the [[unordered pair]] comprising those two vertices). To avoid ambiguity, this type of graph may be described precisely as [[Undirected graph|undirected]] and [[Simple graph|simple]].\n\nOther senses of ''graph'' stem from different conceptions of the edge set. In one more generalized notion,<ref>See, for instance, Graham et al., p.&nbsp;5.</ref> ''V'' is a set together with a relation of ''incidence'' that associates two vertices with each edge. In another generalized notion, ''E'' is a [[multiset]] of unordered pairs of (not necessarily distinct) vertices. Many authors call this type of object a [[multigraph]] or pseudograph.\n\nAll of these variants and others are described more fully below.\n\nThe vertices belonging to an edge are called the ''ends'' or ''end vertices'' of the edge. A vertex may exist in a graph and not belong to an edge.\n\n''V'' and ''E'' are usually taken to be finite, and many of the well-known results are not true (or are rather different) for infinite graphs because many of the arguments fail in the [[infinite graph|infinite case]]. The ''order'' of a graph is |''V'' |, its number of vertices. The ''size'' of a graph is |''E''|, its number of edges. The ''[[Degree (graph theory)|degree]]'' or ''valency'' of a vertex is the number of edges that connect to it, where an edge that connects a vertex to itself (a [[loop (graph theory)|loop]]) is counted twice.\n\nFor an edge {{nobreak|{''x'', ''y''}}}, graph theorists usually use the somewhat shorter notation ''xy''.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Wikipedia multilingual network graph July 2013.svg|thumb|The network graph formed by Wikipedia editors (edges) contributing to different Wikipedia language versions (vertices) during one month in summer 2013<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=1312.0976|last1=Hale|first1=Scott A.|title=Multilinguals and Wikipedia Editing|year=2013|doi=10.1145/2615569.2615684|journal=Proceedings of the 2014 ACM conference on Web science - WebSci '14}}</ref>]]\n\nGraphs can be used to model many types of relations and processes in physical, biological,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mashaghi |first=A. |title=Investigation of a protein complex network |journal=European Physical Journal B |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=113\u2013121 |year=2004 |doi=10.1140/epjb/e2004-00301-0 |display-authors=etal|arxiv=cond-mat/0304207 |bibcode=2004EPJB...41..113M }}</ref> social and information systems. Many practical problems can be represented by graphs. Emphasizing their application to real-world systems, the term ''network'' is sometimes defined to mean a graph in which attributes (e.g. names) are associated with the nodes and/or edges. And the subject that expresses and understands the real-world systems as a network is called [[Network science]].\n\n=== Computer science ===\nIn [[computer science]], graphs are used to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. For instance, the link structure of a [[website]] can be represented by a directed graph, in which the vertices represent web pages and directed edges represent [[Hyperlink|links]] from one page to another. A similar approach can be taken to problems in social media,<ref>{{Cite journal | volume = 3| issue = 1| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = A social network analysis of Twitter: Mapping the digital humanities community| journal =Cogent Arts & Humanities| date = 2016| pages = 1171458| url = http://cogentoa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311983.2016.1171458 |doi=10.1080/23311983.2016.1171458}}</ref> travel, biology, computer chip design, mapping the progression of neuro-degenerative diseases,<ref>{{Cite Journal | volume = 11| issue = 2| last = Vecchio | first = F| title = \u201cSmall World\u201d architecture in brain connectivity and hippocampal volume in Alzheimer\u2019s disease: a study via graph theory from EEG data| journal =Brain imaging and behavior| date = 2017| pages = 473-485| pmid =26960946 |}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Journal | volume = 81| issue = 2| last = Vecchio | first = F| title = Brain network connectivity assessed using graph theory in frontotemporal dementia| journal = Neurology| date = 2013| pages = 134-143| url =http://n.neurology.org/content/81/2/134 |}}</ref> and many other fields. The development of [[algorithm]]s to handle graphs is therefore of major interest in computer science. The [[Graph transformation|transformation of graph]]s is often formalized and represented by [[graph rewriting|graph rewrite system]]s. Complementary to [[graph transformation]] systems focusing on rule-based in-memory manipulation of graphs are [[graph database]]s geared towards [[Database transaction|transaction]]-safe, [[Persistence (computer science)|persistent]] storing and querying of [[Graph (data structure)|graph-structured data]].\n\n=== Linguistics ===\nGraph-theoretic methods, in various forms, have proven particularly useful in [[linguistics]], since natural language often lends itself well to discrete structure. Traditionally, [[syntax]] and compositional semantics follow tree-based structures, whose expressive power lies in the [[principle of compositionality]], modeled in a hierarchical graph. More contemporary approaches such as [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]] model the syntax of natural language using [[feature structure|typed feature structure]]s, which are [[directed acyclic graph]]s. \nWithin [[lexical semantics]], especially as applied to computers, modeling word meaning is easier when a given word is understood in terms of related words; [[semantic network]]s are therefore important in [[computational linguistics]]. Still, other methods in phonology (e.g. [[optimality theory]], which uses [[lattice graph]]s) and morphology (e.g. finite-state morphology, using [[finite-state transducer]]s) are common in the analysis of language as a graph. Indeed, the usefulness of this area of mathematics to linguistics has borne organizations such as [http://www.textgraphs.org/ TextGraphs], as well as various 'Net' projects, such as [[WordNet]], [[VerbNet]], and others.\n\n=== Physics and chemistry ===\nGraph theory is also used to study molecules in [[chemistry]] and [[physics]]. In [[condensed matter physics]], the three-dimensional structure of complicated simulated atomic structures can be studied quantitatively by gathering statistics on graph-theoretic properties related to the topology of the atoms.

Similarly, in [[computational neuroscience]] graphs can be used to represent functional connections between brain areas that interact to give rise to various cognitive processes, where the vertices represent different areas of the brain and the edges represent the connections between those areas.

Influence graphs model whether certain people can influence the behavior of others. Finally, collaboration graphs model whether two people work together in a particular way, such as acting in a movie together.\n\n=== Biology ===\nLikewise, graph theory is useful in [[biology]] and conservation efforts where a vertex can represent regions where certain species exist (or inhabit) and the edges represent migration paths or movement between the regions. This information is important when looking at breeding patterns or tracking the spread of disease, parasites or how changes to the movement can affect other species.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nIn mathematics, graphs are useful in geometry and certain parts of topology such as [[knot theory]]. [[Algebraic graph theory]] has close links with [[group theory]].\n\n=== Other topics ===\nA graph structure can be extended by assigning a weight to each edge of the graph. Graphs with weights, or [[weighted graph]]s, are used to represent structures in which pairwise connections have some numerical values. For example, if a graph represents a road network, the weights could represent the length of each road. There may be several weights associated with each edge, including distance (as in the previous example), travel time, or monetary cost. Such weighted graphs are commonly used to program GPS's, and travel-planning search engines that compare flight times and costs.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Konigsberg bridges.png|thumb|The K\u00f6nigsberg Bridge problem]]\n\nThe paper written by [[Leonhard Euler]] on the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]] and published in 1736 is regarded as the first paper in the history of graph theory.<ref name=\"Biggs\">{{Citation|author1=Biggs, N. |author2=Lloyd, E. |author3=Wilson, R. |title=Graph Theory, 1736-1936|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986}}</ref> This paper, as well as the one written by [[Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]] on the ''[[Knight's tour|knight problem]],'' carried on with the ''analysis situs'' initiated by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].

Many incorrect proofs have been proposed, including those by Cayley, [[Alfred Kempe|Kempe]], and others. The study and the generalization of this problem by [[Peter Tait (physicist)|Tait]], [[Percy John Heawood|Heawood]], [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] and [[Hugo Hadwiger|Hadwiger]] led to the study of the colorings of the graphs embedded on surfaces with arbitrary [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]]. Tait's reformulation generated a new class of problems, the ''factorization problems'', particularly studied by [[Julius Petersen|Petersen]] and [[D\u00e9nes K\u0151nig|K\u0151nig]]. The works of Ramsey on colorations and more specially the results obtained by [[P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n|Tur\u00e1n]] in 1941 was at the origin of another branch of graph theory, ''[[extremal graph theory]]''.\n\nThe four color problem remained unsolved for more than a century. In 1969 [[Heinrich Heesch]] published a method for solving the problem using computers.<ref>Heinrich Heesch: Untersuchungen zum Vierfarbenproblem.

Another important factor of common development of graph theory and [[topology]] came from the use of the techniques of modern algebra. The first example of such a use comes from the work of the physicist [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], who published in 1845 his [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] for calculating the [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]] in [[electric circuit]]s.\n\nThe introduction of probabilistic methods in graph theory, especially in the study of [[Paul Erd\u0151s|Erd\u0151s]] and [[Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi|R\u00e9nyi]] of the asymptotic probability of graph connectivity, gave rise to yet another branch, known as ''[[Random graph|random graph theory]]'', which has been a fruitful source of graph-theoretic results.\n\n==Graph drawing==\n{{main|Graph drawing}}\n\nGraphs are represented visually by drawing a dot or circle for every vertex, and drawing an arc between two vertices if they are connected by an edge. If the graph is directed, the direction is indicated by drawing an arrow.\n\nA graph drawing should not be confused with the graph itself (the abstract, non-visual structure) as there are several ways to structure the graph drawing. All that matters is which vertices are connected to which others by how many edges and not the exact layout. In practice, it is often difficult to decide if two drawings represent the same graph. Depending on the problem domain some layouts may be better suited and easier to understand than others.\n\nThe pioneering work of [[W. T. Tutte]] was very influential on the subject of graph drawing. Among other achievements, he introduced the use of linear algebraic methods to obtain graph drawings.\n\nGraph drawing also can be said to encompass problems that deal with the [[Crossing number (graph theory)|crossing number]] and its various generalizations. The crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of intersections between edges that a drawing of the graph in the plane must contain. For a [[planar graph]], the crossing number is zero by definition.\n\nDrawings on surfaces other than the plane are also studied.\n\n==Graph-theoretic data structures==\n{{main|Graph (abstract data type)}}\n\nThere are different ways to store graphs in a computer system. The [[data structure]] used depends on both the graph structure and the [[algorithm]] used for manipulating the graph. Theoretically one can distinguish between list and matrix structures but in concrete applications the best structure is often a combination of both. List structures are often preferred for [[sparse graph]]s as they have smaller memory requirements. [[Matrix(mathematics)|Matrix]] structures on the other hand provide faster access for some applications but can consume huge amounts of memory.\n\nList structures include the [[incidence list]], an array of pairs of vertices, and the [[adjacency list]], which separately lists the neighbors of each vertex: Much like the incidence list, each vertex has a list of which vertices it is adjacent to.\n\nMatrix structures include the [[incidence matrix]], a matrix of 0's and 1's whose rows represent vertices and whose columns represent edges, and the [[adjacency matrix]], in which both the rows and columns are indexed by vertices. In both cases a 1 indicates two adjacent objects and a 0 indicates two non-adjacent objects. The [[Laplacian matrix]] is a modified form of the adjacency matrix that incorporates information about the [[degree (graph theory)|degrees]] of the vertices, and is useful in some calculations such as [[Kirchhoff's theorem]] on the number of [[spanning tree]]s of a graph.\nThe [[distance matrix]], like the adjacency matrix, has both its rows and columns indexed by vertices, but rather than containing a 0 or a 1 in each cell it contains the length of a [[shortest path]] between two vertices.\n\n==Problems==\n\n===Enumeration===\nThere is a large literature on [[graphical enumeration]]: the problem of counting graphs meeting specified conditions. Some of this work is found in Harary and Palmer (1973).\n\n===Subgraphs, induced subgraphs, and minors===\nA common problem, called the [[subgraph isomorphism problem]], is finding a fixed graph as a [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] in a given graph. One reason to be interested in such a question is that many [[graph properties]] are ''hereditary'' for subgraphs, which means that a graph has the property if and only if all subgraphs have it too.\nUnfortunately, finding maximal subgraphs of a certain kind is often an [[NP-complete problem]]. For example:\n* Finding the largest complete subgraph is called the [[clique problem]] (NP-complete).\n\nA similar problem is finding [[induced subgraph]]s in a given graph. Again, some important graph properties are hereditary with respect to induced subgraphs, which means that a graph has a property if and only if all induced subgraphs also have it. Finding maximal induced subgraphs of a certain kind is also often NP-complete. For example:\n* Finding the largest edgeless induced subgraph or [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] is called the [[independent set problem]] (NP-complete).\n\nStill another such problem, the minor containment problem, is to find a fixed graph as a minor of a given graph. A [[Minor (graph theory)|minor]] or subcontraction of a graph is any graph obtained by taking a subgraph and contracting some (or no) edges. Many graph properties are hereditary for minors, which means that a graph has a property if and only if all minors have it too. For example, [[Wagner's theorem|Wagner's Theorem]] states: \n* A graph is [[planar graph|planar]] if it contains as a minor neither the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''<sub>3,3</sub> (see the [[Three-cottage problem]]) nor the complete graph ''K''<sub>5</sub>.\n\nA similar problem, the subdivision containment problem, is to find a fixed graph as a [[Subdivision (graph theory)|subdivision]] of a given graph. A [[Subdivision (graph theory)|subdivision]] or [[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|homeomorphism]] of a graph is any graph obtained by subdividing some (or no) edges. Subdivision containment is related to graph properties such as [[Planarity (graph theory)|planarity]]. For example, [[Kuratowski's theorem|Kuratowski's Theorem]] states:   \n* A graph is [[Planar graph|planar]] if it contains as a subdivision neither the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''<sub>3,3</sub> nor the [[complete graph]] ''K''<sub>5</sub>.\n\nAnother problem in subdivision containment is [[Kelmans\u2013Seymour conjecture]]:\n* Every [[K-vertex-connected graph|5-vertex-connected]] graph that is not [[Planar graph|planar]] contains a [[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivision]] of the 5-vertex [[complete graph]] ''K''<sub>5</sub>.\nAnother class of problems has to do with the extent to which various species and generalizations of graphs are determined by their ''point-deleted subgraphs''. For example:\n* The [[reconstruction conjecture]]\n\n===Graph coloring===\n{{main|Graph coloring}}\nMany problems and theorems in graph theory have to do with various ways of coloring graphs.  Typically, one is interested in coloring a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, or with other similar restrictions.  One may also consider coloring edges (possibly so that no two coincident edges are the same color), or other variations.  Among the famous results and conjectures concerning graph coloring are the following:\n* [[Four-color theorem]]\n* [[Strong perfect graph theorem]]\n* [[Erd\u0151s\u2013Faber\u2013Lov\u00e1sz conjecture]] (unsolved)\n* [[Total coloring|Total coloring conjecture]], also called [[Mehdi Behzad|Behzad]]'s conjecture (unsolved)\n* [[List edge-coloring|List coloring conjecture]] (unsolved)\n* [[Hadwiger conjecture (graph theory)]] (unsolved)\n\n===Subsumption and unification===\nConstraint modeling theories concern families of directed graphs related by a [[partial order]]. In these applications, graphs are ordered by specificity, meaning that more constrained graphs\u2014which are more specific and thus contain a greater amount of information\u2014are subsumed by those that are more general. Operations between graphs include evaluating the direction of a subsumption relationship between two graphs, if any, and computing graph unification. The unification of two argument graphs is defined as the most general graph (or the computation thereof) that is consistent with (i.e. contains all of the information in) the inputs, if such a graph exists; efficient unification algorithms are known.\n\nFor constraint frameworks which are strictly [[Principle of Compositionality|compositional]], graph unification is the sufficient satisfiability and combination function. Well-known applications include [[Automatic theorem prover|automatic theorem proving]] and modeling the [[Parsing|elaboration of linguistic structure]].\n\n===Route problems===\n* [[Hamiltonian path problem]]\n* [[Minimum spanning tree]]\n* [[Route inspection problem]] (also called the \"Chinese postman problem\")\n* [[Seven bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]]\n* [[Shortest path problem]]\n* [[Steiner tree]]\n* [[Three-cottage problem]]\n* [[Traveling salesman problem]] (NP-hard)\n\n===Network flow===\nThere are numerous problems arising especially from applications that have to do with various notions of [[Flow network|flows in networks]], for example:\n* [[Max flow min cut theorem]]\n\n===Visibility problems ===\n* [[Museum guard problem]]\n\n===Covering problems===\n[[Covering problem]]s in graphs are specific instances of subgraph-finding problems, and they tend to be closely related to the [[clique problem]] or the [[independent set problem]].\n* [[Set cover problem]]\n* [[Vertex cover problem]]\n\n===Decomposition problems===\nDecomposition, defined as partitioning the edge set of a graph (with as many vertices as necessary accompanying the edges of each part of the partition), has a wide variety of question. Often, it is required to decompose a graph into subgraphs isomorphic to a fixed graph; for instance, decomposing a complete graph into Hamiltonian cycles. Other problems specify a family of graphs into which a given graph should be decomposed, for instance, a family of cycles, or decomposing a complete graph ''K''<sub>''n''</sub> into {{nobreak|''n'' \u2212 1}} specified trees having, respectively, 1, 2, 3, \u2026, {{nobreak|''n'' \u2212 1}} edges.\n\nSome specific decomposition problems that have been studied include:\n* [[Arboricity]], a decomposition into as few forests as possible\n* [[Cycle double cover]], a decomposition into a collection of cycles covering each edge exactly twice\n* [[Edge coloring]], a decomposition into as few [[matching (graph theory)|matching]]s as possible\n* [[Graph factorization]], a decomposition of a [[regular graph]] into regular subgraphs of given degrees\n\n===Graph classes===\nMany problems involve characterizing the members of various classes of graphs. Some examples of such questions are below:\n* [[Graph enumeration|Enumerating]] the members of a class\n* Characterizing a class in terms of [[Forbidden graph characterization|forbidden substructure]]s\n* Ascertaining relationships among classes (e.g. does one property of graphs imply another)\n* Finding efficient [[algorithm]]s to [[Decision problem|decide]] membership in a class\n* Finding [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]]s for members of a class\n\n==See also==\n{{div col |colwidth=20em |small=yes}}\n* [[Gallery of named graphs]]\n* [[Glossary of graph theory]]\n* [[List of graph theory topics]]\n* [[List of unsolved problems in graph theory]]\n* [[List of publications in mathematics#Graph theory|Publications in graph theory]]\n\n===Related topics===\n* [[Algebraic graph theory]]\n* [[Citation graph]]\n* [[Conceptual graph]]\n* [[Data structure]]\n* [[Disjoint-set data structure]]\n* [[Dual-phase evolution]]\n* [[Entitative graph]]\n* [[Existential graph]]\n* [[Graph algebra]]\n* [[Graph automorphism]]\n* [[Graph coloring]]\n* [[Graph database]]\n* [[Graph (data structure)|Graph data structure]]\n* [[Graph drawing]]\n* [[Graph equation]]\n* [[Graph rewriting]]\n* [[Graph sandwich problem]]\n* [[Graph property]]\n* [[Intersection graph]]\n* [[Logical graph]]\n* [[Loop (graph theory)|Loop]]\n* [[Network theory]]\n* [[Null graph]]\n* [[Pebble motion problems]]\n* [[Percolation]]\n* [[Perfect graph]]\n* [[Quantum graph]]\n* [[Random regular graph]]s\n* [[Semantic networks]]\n* [[Spectral graph theory]]\n* [[Strongly regular graph]]s\n* [[Symmetric graph]]s\n* [[Transitive reduction]]\n* [[Tree (data structure)|Tree data structure]]\n\n===Algorithms===\n* [[Bellman\u2013Ford algorithm]]\n* [[Dijkstra's algorithm]]\n* [[Ford\u2013Fulkerson algorithm]]\n* [[Kruskal's algorithm]]\n* [[Nearest neighbour algorithm]]\n* [[Prim's algorithm]]\n* [[Depth-first search]]\n* [[Breadth-first search]]\n\n===Subareas===\n* [[Algebraic graph theory]]\n* [[Geometric graph theory]]\n* [[Extremal graph theory]]\n* [[Random graph|Probabilistic graph theory]]\n* [[Topological graph theory]]\n\n===Related areas of mathematics===\n* [[Combinatorics]]\n* [[Group theory]]\n* [[Knot theory]]\n* [[Ramsey theory]]\n\n===Generalizations===\n* [[Hypergraph]]\n* [[Abstract simplicial complex]]\n\n===Prominent graph theorists===\n* [[Noga Alon|Alon, Noga]]\n* [[Claude Berge|Berge, Claude]]\n* [[B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s|Bollob\u00e1s, B\u00e9la]]\n* [[John Adrian Bondy|Bondy, Adrian John]]\n* [[Graham Brightwell|Brightwell, Graham]]\n* [[Maria Chudnovsky|Chudnovsky, Maria]]\n* [[Fan Chung|Chung, Fan]]\n* [[Gabriel Andrew Dirac|Dirac, Gabriel Andrew]]\n* [[Paul Erd\u0151s|Erd\u0151s, Paul]]\n* [[Leonhard Euler|Euler, Leonhard]]\n* [[Ralph Faudree|Faudree, Ralph]]\n* [[Herbert Fleischner|Fleischner, Herbert]]\n* [[Martin Charles Golumbic|Golumbic, Martin]]\n* [[Ronald Graham|Graham, Ronald]]\n* [[Frank Harary|Harary, Frank]]\n* [[Percy John Heawood|Heawood, Percy John]]\n* [[Anton Kotzig|Kotzig, Anton]]\n* [[D\u00e9nes K\u0151nig|K\u0151nig, D\u00e9nes]]\n* [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz|Lov\u00e1sz, L\u00e1szl\u00f3]]\n* [[U.

He was a precocious composer of operas, and he made his debut at age 18 with ''[[La cambiale di matrimonio]]''. His best-known operas include the Italian comedies ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' (''Il barbiere di Siviglia''), ''The Italian Girl in Algiers'' (''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]''), and ''Cinderella'' (''[[La Cenerentola]]''). He also wrote a string of serious operas in Italian, including works such as ''[[Tancredi]]'', ''[[Otello (Rossini)|Otello]]'', and ''[[Semiramide]]''. ''The Thieving Magpie'' (''[[La gazza ladra]]'') features one of his most celebrated [[overture]]s. \n\nRossini moved to Paris in 1824 where he began to set French [[libretto]]s to music. His last opera was the epic ''[[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]]'' (''Guillaume Tell''), featuring [[William Tell Overture|its iconic overture]] which helped to usher in [[grand opera]] in France. A tendency for inspired, song-like melodies is evident throughout his scores, which earned him the nickname \"the Italian [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].\" He was a rapid and prolific composer, quoted as joking, \"Give me the laundress' bill and I will even set that to music.\"<ref>[[Indro Montanelli|Montanelli, Indro]] (1972), ''L'Italia giacobina e carbonara (1789\u20131831)'', p. 612, Milan: Rizzoli. {{ISBN|9788817420136}}</ref> He also earned the nickname \"Signor Crescendo\" for his use of an exciting buildup of orchestral sound over a [[ostinato|repeated phrase]], which is now commonly known as a \"Rossini [[crescendo]]\". Until his retirement in 1829, Rossini had been the most popular opera composer in history.<ref>Till 1987, p. 11</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Pesaro-Gioacchino Rossini.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Rossini as a young man]]\nGioachino Antonio Rossini was born into a family of musicians in [[Pesaro]], a town on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast of Italy that was then part of the [[Papal States]]. His father, Giuseppe, was a horn player and inspector of slaughterhouses. His mother, Anna, was a [[singing|singer]] and a baker's daughter.\n\nRossini's father was sympathetic to the [[French Revolution]] and welcomed [[Napoleon]]'s troops when they arrived in northern Italy. When [[Austria]] restored the old regime, Rossini's father was sent to prison in 1799, where he remained until June 1800.<ref>Osborne 2007, p. 5</ref> Rossini's mother took him to [[Bologna]], making a living as leading singer at various theatres of the [[Romagna]] region. Her husband would ultimately join her in Bologna. During this time, Rossini was frequently left in the care of his aging grandmother, who had difficulty supervising the boy.\n\nHe remained at Bologna in the care of a pork butcher while his father played the horn in the orchestras of the theatres at which his wife sang. The boy had three years of instruction in the playing of the [[harpsichord]] from Giuseppe Prinetti, originally from [[Novara]], who played the scale with two fingers only; Prinetti also owned a business selling beer and had a propensity to fall asleep while standing. These qualities made him a subject for ridicule in the eyes of the young Rossini.<ref>Osborne 2007, p. 7</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nHe was eventually taken from Prinetti and apprenticed to a blacksmith. In Angelo Tesei, he found a congenial music master, and learned to [[sight-read]], play accompaniments on the [[piano]] and sing well enough to take solo parts in the church when he was ten years of age. Important products of this period are six ''sonate a quattro'', or string sonatas, composed in three days, unusually scored for two violins, cello and double bass. The original scores, dating from 1804 when the composer was twelve, were found in the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington D.C. Often transcribed for string orchestra, these sonatas reveal the young composer's affinity for [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], already showing signs of operatic tendencies, punctuated by frequent rhythmic changes and dominated by clear, songlike melodies.\n\nIn 1805, he appeared at the theatre of the Commune in [[Ferdinando Paer]]'s ''Camilla'', his only public appearance as a singer. He was also a capable horn player, treading in the footsteps of his father. Around this time, he composed individual numbers to a [[libretto]] by Vincenza Mombelli called ''[[Demetrio e Polibio]]'', which was handed to the boy in pieces. Though it was Rossini's first opera, written when he was thirteen or fourteen, the work was not staged until the composer was twenty years old, premiering as his sixth official opera.\n\nIn 1806, Rossini became a [[cello]] student under Cavedagni at the [[Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini|Conservatorio di Bologna]]. The following year he was admitted to the counterpoint class of Padre [[Stanislao Mattei]] (1750\u20131825). He learned to play the cello with ease, but the pedantic severity of Mattei's views on counterpoint served only to drive the young composer's views toward a freer school of composition. His insight into orchestral resources is generally ascribed not to the strict compositional rules that he learned from Mattei, but to knowledge gained independently while scoring the quartets and symphonies of Haydn and Mozart. At Bologna, he was known as \"il Tedeschino\" (\"the Little German\") on account of his devotion to Mozart.\n\n==Career as a composer==\n===Early years: ''Demetrio e Polibio'' (1812) to ''Torvaldo e Dorliska'' (1815)===\nThrough the friendly interposition of the Marquis Cavalli, his first opera, ''[[La cambiale di matrimonio]]'' (''The Marriage Contract''), was produced at Venice when he was a youth of 18 years. Two years before this he had already received the prize at the Conservatorio of Bologna for his cantata ''Il pianto d'Armonia sulla morte d'Orfeo''. Between 1810 and 1813 at Bologna, Rome, Venice and Milan, Rossini produced operas of varying success, most notably ''[[La pietra del paragone]]'' and ''[[Il signor Bruschino]]'', with its brilliant and unique overture. In 1813, ''[[Tancredi]]'' and ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'' were even bigger successes, and catapulted the 20-year-old composer to international fame.\n\nThe libretto for ''Tancredi'' was an arrangement by [[Gaetano Rossi]] of [[Voltaire]]'s tragedy ''Tancr\u00e8de''. Traces of [[Ferdinando Paer]] and [[Giovanni Paisiello]] were undeniably present in fragments of the music. But any critical feeling on the part of the public was drowned by appreciation of such melodies as \"''Di tanti palpiti... Mi rivedrai, ti rivedr\u00f2''\", which became so popular that the Italians would sing it in crowds at the law courts until called upon by the judge to desist.\n[[File:Rossini-portrait-0.jpg|thumb|upright|Gioachino Rossini, c. 1815 (portrait by [[Vincenzo Camuccini]])]]\n\nBy the age of 21, Rossini had established himself as the idol of the Italian opera public. He continued to write operas for Venice and Milan during the next few years, but their reception was tame and in some cases unsatisfactory after the success of ''Tancredi.'' In 1815 he retired to his home in Bologna, where [[Domenico Barbaia]], the impresario of the [[Naples]] theatre, contracted an agreement that made him musical director of the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] and the [[Teatro del Fondo]] at Naples. He would compose one opera a year for each. His payment was to be 200 ducats per month; he was also to receive a share from the gambling tables set in the theatre's \"ridotto\", amounting to about 1000 ducats per annum. This was an extraordinarily lucrative arrangement for any professional musician at that time.\n\nHe visited the Naples conservatory, and, although less than four years senior to [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]], he said to the Director [[Niccol\u00f2 Antonio Zingarelli|Niccol\u00f2 Zingarelli]], \"My compliments Maestro\u2014your young pupil Mercadante begins where we finish.\"<ref name=\"RCAFluteConcertos\">Michael Rose 2004, \"Mercadante: Flute Concertos\", booklet accompanying the RCA CD recording with [[James Galway]] and [[I Solisti Veneti]] under [[Claudio Scimone]].</ref>\n\nSome older composers in Naples, notably Zingarelli and Paisiello, were inclined to intrigue against the success of the youthful composer, but all hostility was rendered futile by the enthusiasm that greeted the court performance of his ''[[Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra]]'', in which [[Isabella Colbran]], who subsequently became the composer's wife, took a leading part. The libretto of this opera by [[Giovanni Schmidt]] was in many of its incidents an anticipation of those presented to the world a few years later in Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]]''. The opera was the first in which Rossini wrote out the ornaments of the arias instead of leaving them to the fancy of the singers, and also the first in which the [[Recitative#Secco|''secco'' recitative]] was replaced by a [[Recitative#Accompagnato (or obbligato)|recitative accompanied]] by a [[string quartet]].\n\n===Resounding success of ''The Barber of Seville'' (1816)===\n[[File:Isabella Colbran.jpg|thumb|upright|Isabella Colbran]]\n{{Main article|The Barber of Seville}}\nRossini's most famous opera was produced on 20 February 1816, at the [[Teatro Argentina]] in Rome. The libretto, a version of Beaumarchais' stage play ''[[The Barber of Seville (play)|Le Barbier de S\u00e9ville]]'', was newly written by [[Cesare Sterbini]] and not the same as that already used by [[Giovanni Paisiello]] in his own ''Barbiere'', an opera which had enjoyed European popularity for more than a quarter of a century. Much is made of how quickly Rossini's opera was written, scholarship generally agreeing upon two or three weeks. Later in life, Rossini claimed to have written the opera in only twelve days. It was a colossal failure when it premiered as ''Almaviva''; Paisiello's admirers were extremely indignant, sabotaging the production by whistling and shouting during the entire first act. However, not long after the second performance, the opera became so successful that the fame of Paisiello's opera was transferred to Rossini's, to which the title ''The Barber of Seville'' passed as an inalienable heritage.\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Muslim Magomaev Cavatina di Figaro.ogg|title=Cavatina di Figaro|description=\"Largo al factotum\" performed by [[Muslim Magomayev (musician)|Muslim Magomayev]] (27 second sample)}}\nLater in 1822, a 30-year-old Rossini succeeded in meeting [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who was then aged 51, deaf, cantankerous and in failing health. Communicating in writing, Beethoven noted: \"Ah, Rossini. So you're the composer of ''The Barber of Seville''. I congratulate you. It will be played as long as Italian opera exists. Never try to write anything else but [[opera buffa]]; any other style would do violence to your nature.\"<ref name=\"Fisher\">Fisher 2005{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Middle years: ''La gazzetta'' (1816) to ''Semiramide'' (1823)===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:GiorcesRossini1.jpg|thumb|upright|Gioachino Rossini in 1820, International Museum and Library of Music, Bologna]]\nBetween 1815 and 1823 Rossini produced 20 operas. Of these, ''[[Otello (Rossini)|Otello]]'' formed the climax to his reform of serious opera (''[[opera seria]]''), and offers a suggestive contrast with the treatment of the same subject at a similar point of artistic development by the composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]]. In Rossini's time, the tragic ending was so distasteful to the public of Rome that it was necessary to invent a happy conclusion to ''Otello''.\n\nConditions of stage production in 1817 are illustrated by Rossini's acceptance of the subject of [[Cinderella]] for a libretto only on the condition that the supernatural element should be omitted. The opera ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' was as successful as ''Barbiere''. The absence of a similar precaution in construction of his ''[[Mos\u00e8 in Egitto]]'' led to disaster in the scene depicting the passage of the Israelites through the [[Red Sea]], when the defects in stage contrivance always raised a laugh, so that the composer was at length compelled to introduce the chorus ''\"Dal tuo stellato soglio\"'' to divert attention from the dividing waves.\n\nIn 1822, four years after the production of this work, Rossini married the renowned opera singer [[Isabella Colbran]]. In the same year, he moved from Italy to Vienna, where his operas were the rage of the audiences. He directed his ''Cenerentola'' in [[Vienna]], where ''[[Zelmira]]'' was also performed. After this he returned to Bologna, but an invitation from Metternich to the [[Congress of Verona]] to \"assist in the general re-establishment of harmony\" was too tempting to refuse, and he arrived at the Congress in time for its opening on 20 October 1822. Here he made friends with [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]] and [[Dorothea Lieven]]. The opera ''[[Semiramide]]'' was first performed at [[La Fenice]] in Venice on 3 February 1823. It was Rossini's last Italian opera.\n\nIn 1823, at the suggestion of the manager of the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]], London, he came to Britain, being much f\u00eated on his way through Paris. He was given a generous welcome, which included an introduction to King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and the receipt of \u00a37000 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|7000|1823|r=-4}} today) after a residence of five months. The next year, he became musical director of the ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien (1801\u20131878)|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Italiens]]'' in Paris at a salary of \u00a3800 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|800|1824|r=-3}} today) per annum. Rossini's popularity in Paris was so great that [[Charles X]] gave him a contract to write five new operas a year, and at the expiration of the contract, he was to receive a generous pension for life.\n\n===Composing for Paris: ''Il viaggio a Reims'' (1825) to ''Guillaume Tell'' (1829)===\n[[File:ROSSINI-1829-Litho Charlet Ory.jpg|thumb|upright|Rossini in 1829<br>(lithography by Charlet Ory)]]\nDuring his Paris years, Rossini created the comic operas ''[[Il viaggio a Reims]]'' and ''[[Le comte Ory]]'' and the grand opera ''[[William Tell (opera)|Guillaume Tell]]'' (''William Tell''). The production of the latter in 1829 brought his career as a writer of opera to a close. [[Fabio Luisi]] said that Rossini planned for ''Guillaume Tell'' to be his last opera even as he composed it.<ref>Interview on [[Toll Brothers]] [[Metropolitan Opera]] broadcast of ''Guillaume Tell'', rebroadcast on 2017 March 18.</ref>  He was thirty-eight years old and had already composed thirty-eight operas. ''Guillaume Tell'' was a political epic adapted from [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s play ''[[William Tell (play)|Wilhelm Tell]]'' (1804) about [[William Tell|the 13th-century Swiss patriot]] who rallied his country against the Austrians. The libretto was by [[Victor-Joseph \u00c9tienne de Jouy|\u00c9tienne Jouy]] and [[Hippolyte Bis]], but their version was revised by [[Armand Marrast]].<ref>Faul 2009, pp. 139\u201341</ref>\n\nThe music is remarkable for its freedom from the conventions discovered and utilized by Rossini in his earlier works, and marks a transitional stage in the history of opera, [[William Tell Overture|the overture]] serving as a model for romantic overtures throughout the 19th century. Though an excellent opera, it is rarely heard uncut today, as the original score runs more than four hours in performance. The overture is one of the most famous and frequently recorded works in the classical repertoire.\n{{listen|type=music\n|filename=Gioachino_Rossini,_William_Tell_Overture_(military_band_version,_2000).ogg\n|title=''William Tell'' Overture\n|description=The [[United States Marine Corps Band]] performs a [[wind octet]] transcription of the complete ''William Tell'' Overture}}\nIn 1829 he returned to Bologna. His mother had died in 1827, and he was anxious to be with his father. Arrangements for his subsequent return to Paris on a new agreement were temporarily upset by the abdication of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] and the [[July Revolution]] of 1830. Rossini, who had been considering the subject of [[Faust]] for a new opera, did return, however, to Paris in November of that year.\n\nSix movements of his ''[[Stabat Mater (Rossini)|Stabat Mater]]''<ref>The [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]] conserves an autograph reduction of this work for voice and pianoforte in a luxuriously bound edition with gold initials of [[Olympe P\u00e9lissier]], Rossini's second wife (ref.

However, Rossini composed the rest of the score in 1841. The success of the work bears comparison with his achievements in opera, but his comparative silence during the period from 1832 to his death in 1868 makes his biography appear almost like the narrative of two lives\u2014the life of swift triumph and the long life of seclusion, of which biographers give us pictures in stories of the composer's cynical wit, his speculations in fish mongering,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XvURAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA370 \"Anecdotes of Rossini\"] by \"E.\" in Richard Fennell: ''[[The London Magazine]]'', ''[[Charivari]]'', and ''Courrier des dames'', vols.

Political disturbances compelled Rossini to leave Bologna in 1848. After living for a time in Florence, he settled in Paris in 1855, where he hosted many artistic and literary figures in his apartment at 2 [[Rue de la Chauss\u00e9e-d'Antin]].<ref>Osborne 1986, p. 148</ref> Among them was the forty years younger Belgian [[Glass harp|mattauphone]][[:fr:Mattauphone|(fr)]] virtuoso Edmond Michotte, whom Rossini considered his ''quasi figlio''.<ref>The [[Edmond Michotte fund]] of the Library of the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]] holds an important legacy of Rossiniana, including autograph manuscripts, books and objects.</ref>\n \nRossini had been a well-known [[gourmand]] and an excellent amateur chef his entire life, but he indulged these two passions fully once he retired from composing, and today there are a number of dishes with the suffix ''\"alla Rossini\"'' to their names that were created either by or specifically for him. Probably the most famous of these is ''[[tournedos Rossini]]'', still served by many restaurants today.\n\nIn the meantime, after years of various physical and mental illnesses, he had slowly returned to music, composing obscure little works intended for private performance. These included his ''[[P\u00e9ch\u00e9s de vieillesse]]'' (\"Sins of Old Age\"), which are grouped into 14 volumes, mostly for solo piano, occasionally for voice and various chamber ensembles. Often whimsical, these pieces display Rossini's natural ease of composition and gift for melody, showing obvious influences of Beethoven and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], with many flashes of the composer's long buried desire for serious, academic composition. They also underpin the fact that Rossini himself was an outstanding pianist whose playing attracted high praise from people such as [[Franz Liszt]], [[Sigismond Thalberg]], [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], and [[Louis Di\u00e9mer]].<ref>Osborne, 1986, pp. 63, 112, 268</ref>\n\nHe died at the age of 76 from [[pneumonia]] at his country house at [[Passy]] on Friday, 13 November 1868. He was buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, France.

The music was written, but the performance was abandoned shortly before its scheduled premiere. Verdi re-used the \"Libera me, Domine\" he had written for the Rossini Requiem in his 1872 ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem for Manzoni]]''. In 1989 the conductor [[Helmuth Rilling]] recorded the original ''Requiem for Rossini'' in its world premiere.\n\nIn 1900, [[Giuseppe Cassioli]] created a monument to Rossini in the Basilica of [[Santa Croce, Florence]].<ref>[http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/images/conway/ae38df96.html \"Art and Architecture\"] on artandarchitecture.org.uk, published by [[The Courtauld Institute]], London.

Each set was called \"Rossiniana\", and collectively they are called \"Rossiniane\". This was the first known tribute by one composer to another using a title with the ending [[-ana]].\n\nIn 1925, [[Ottorino Respighi]] orchestrated four pieces from ''[[P\u00e9ch\u00e9s de vieillesse]]'' as the suite ''[[Rossiniana]]'' (he had earlier used pieces from the same collection as the basis of his ballet ''[[La Boutique fantasque]]'').\n\n==Music==\nAccording to the ''Oxford History of Western Music'', \"Rossini's fame surpassed that of any previous composer, and so, for a long time, did the popularity of his works. Audiences took to his music as if to an intoxicating drug\u2014or, to put it more decorously, to champagne, with which Rossini's bubbly music was constantly compared.\"<ref name=\"Oxford History1\">Taruskin 2010, p. 14 </ref>\n\nRossini took existing operatic genres and forms and perfected them in his own style. Through his own work, as well as through that of his followers and imitators, Rossini's style dominated Italian opera throughout the first half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Oxford History2\">Taruskin 2010, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\nIn his compositions, Rossini plagiarized freely from himself, a common practice among deadline-pressed opera composers of the time. Few of his operas are without such admixtures, frankly introduced in the form of arias or overtures. For example, in ''Il Barbiere'' there is an aria for the Count (often omitted) \"Cessa di pi\u00f9 resistere\", which Rossini used (with minor changes) in the [[cantata]] ''Le Nozze di Teti e di Peleo'' and in ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' (the cabaletta for Angelina's rondo is almost unchanged). Moreover, four of his best known overtures (''[[La cambiale di matrimonio]]'', ''[[Tancredi]]'', ''La Cenerentola'' and ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'') share operas apart from those with which they are most famously associated.\n\nA characteristic mannerism in Rossini's orchestral scoring is a long, steady building of sound over an [[ostinato]] figure, known as a \"Rossini [[crescendo]]\",<ref>Taruskin (2010) pp. 16\u201320</ref> which earned him the nickname of \"Signor Crescendo\".\n\nA few of Rossini's operas remained popular throughout his lifetime and continuously since his death; others were resurrected from semi-obscurity in the last half of the 20th century, during the so-called \"Rossini Renaissance\".\n\nRossini himself correctly predicted that his ''Barber of Seville'' would continue to find favor with posterity, telling a friend:\"One thing I believe I can assure you: that of my works, the second act of ''Guglielmo Tell'', the third act of ''Otello'', and all of ''il Barbiere di Siviglia'' will certainly endure.\" <ref>Checchi 1887, p. ? {{Page needed|date=October 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Works==\n{{Main article|List of compositions by Gioachino Rossini|List of operas by Gioachino Rossini}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Checchi|first=Eugenio|title=Verdi, il genio et le opere|year=1887|publisher=G.

Written by his son-in-law [[Tacitus]], the ''[[Agricola (book)|De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae]]'' is the primary source for most of what is known about him,<ref>[[Wikisource:Agricola|Tacitus, ''Agricola'']]; [[Dio Cassius]] ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66* ''Roman History'' 66.20]) and three inscriptions found in Britain (including the [[Verulamium Forum inscription]]) also make reference to Agricola.</ref> along with detailed archaeological evidence from northern Britain.<ref>Hanson, W.S. (1991), ''Agricola and the conquest of the north'' (2nd edn), London: Batsford.</ref>\n\nAgricola began his military career in [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britain]], serving under governor [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]]. His subsequent career saw him serve in a variety of positions; he was appointed [[quaestor]] in [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia province]] in 64, then [[Plebeian Tribune]] in 66, and [[praetor]] in 68. He supported [[Vespasian]] during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (69), and was given a military command in Britain when the latter became emperor. When his command ended in 73, he was made [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] in [[Rome]] and appointed governor of [[Gallia Aquitania]]. He was made [[consul]] and [[Governor of Roman Britain|governor of Britannia]] in 77. While there, he completed the conquest of what is now [[Wales]] and [[northern England]], and led his army to the far north of Scotland, establishing forts across much of the Lowlands. He was recalled from Britain in 85 after an unusually lengthy service, and thereafter retired from military and public life.\n\n==Early life==\nAgricola was born in the ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' of [[Fr\u00e9jus|Forum Julii]], [[Gallia Narbonensis]] (now [[Fr\u00e9jus]], [[France]]). Agricola's parents were from noted Gallo-Roman political families of [[Roman senate|senatorial]] rank, and his ancestors were Romanised [[Gauls]] of local origin.<ref>On Agricola's life and career, see A.R. Birley, ''The Roman Government of Britain'' (Oxford, 2005), pp. 71-95, with further references.</ref> Both of his grandfathers served as imperial governors. His father, Lucius Julius Graecinus, was a ''[[praetor]]'' and had become a member of the [[Roman Senate]] in the year of his birth. Graecinus had become distinguished by his interest in philosophy. Between August 40 and January 41, the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Caligula]] ordered his death because he refused to prosecute the Emperor's second cousin [[Marcus Junius Silanus (consul AD 15)|Marcus Junius Silanus]].<ref name=\"OCD\">{{Citation  | last = Birley  | first = Anthony R.  | author-link = Anthony Birley  | contribution = Iulius Agricola, Cn.  | editor-last = Hornblower  | editor-first = Simon  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | volume =   | pages =   | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | place = Oxford  | year = 1996  | contribution-url =  }}</ref>\n\nHis mother was Julia Procilla. The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] describes her as \"a lady of singular virtue\". Tacitus states that Procilla had a fond affection for her son. Agricola was educated in Massilia ([[Marseille]]), and showed what was considered an unhealthy interest in philosophy.\n\n==Political career==\nHe began his career in Roman public life as a military [[tribune]], serving in Britain under [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]] from 58 to 62. He was probably attached to the ''[[Legio II Augusta]]'', but was chosen to serve on Suetonius's staff<ref>''Agricola'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#5|5]]</ref> and thus almost certainly participated in the suppression of [[Boudica]]'s uprising in 61.\n\nReturning from Britain to [[Rome]] in 62, he married [[Domitia Decidiana]], a woman of noble birth. Their first child was a son. Agricola was appointed as ''[[quaestor]]'' for 64, which he served in the [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]] under the corrupt proconsul [[Titianus|Lucius Salvius Otho Titianus]]. While he was there, his daughter, [[Julia Agricola]], was born, but his son died shortly afterwards. He was [[tribune]] of the plebs in 66 and ''[[praetor]]'' in June 68, during which time he was ordered by the Governor of Spain [[Galba]] to take an inventory of the temple treasures.\n\nDuring that same, the emperor [[Nero]] was declared a public enemy by the Senate and committed suicide, and the period of civil war known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] began. Galba succeeded Nero, but was murdered in early 69 by [[Otho]], who took the throne. Agricola's mother was murdered on her estate in [[Liguria]] by Otho's marauding fleet. Hearing of [[Vespasian]]'s bid for the empire, Agricola immediately gave him his support. Otho meanwhile committed suicide after being defeated by Vitellius.\n\nAfter Vespasian had established himself as emperor, Agricola was appointed to the command of the ''[[Legio XX Valeria Victrix]]'', stationed in Britain, in place of [[Marcus Roscius Coelius]], who had stirred up a mutiny against the governor, [[Marcus Vettius Bolanus]]. Britain had revolted during the year of civil war, and Bolanus was a mild governor. Agricola reimposed discipline on the legion and helped to consolidate Roman rule. In 71, Bolanus was replaced by a more aggressive governor, [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]], and Agricola was able to display his talents as a commander in campaigns against the [[Brigantes]] in northern England.\n\nWhen his command ended in 73, Agricola was enrolled as a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and appointed to govern [[Gallia Aquitania]]. There he stayed for almost three years. In 76 or 77, he was recalled to Rome and appointed suffect [[consul]],<ref>D.B. Campbell, \"The consulship of Agricola\", ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik]]'' 63 (1986), pp. 197-200, for the possible dates.</ref> and betrothed his daughter to [[Tacitus]]. The following year, Tacitus and Julia married; Agricola was appointed to the [[College of Pontiffs]], and returned to Britain for a third time, as its [[Governor of Roman Britain|governor]] (''[[Legatus Augusti pro praetore]]'').\n\n==Governor of Britain==\n[[File:Agricola.Campaigns.78.84.jpg|frameless|right|201px]]\nArriving in midsummer of 77, Agricola discovered that the [[Ordovices]] of north Wales had virtually destroyed the Roman cavalry stationed in their territory. He immediately moved against them and defeated them. He then moved north to the island of Mona ([[Anglesey]]), which Suetonius Paulinus had failed to subjugate in 60 because of the outbreak of the [[Boudica|Boudican rebellion]], and forced its inhabitants to sue for peace. He established a good reputation as an administrator, as well as a commander, by reforming the widely corrupt corn levy. He introduced Romanising measures, encouraging communities to build towns on the Roman model and educating the sons of the native nobility in the Roman manner.\n\nAgricola also expanded Roman rule north into Caledonia (modern [[Scotland]]). In the summer of 79, he pushed his armies to the estuary of the river Taus, usually interpreted as the [[Firth of Tay]], virtually unchallenged, and established some forts. Though their location is left unspecified, the close dating of the fort at [[Elginhaugh]] in Midlothian makes it a possible candidate.\n\n===Agricola in Ireland?===\nIn 81, Agricola \"crossed in the first ship\" and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then. Tacitus, in Chapter 24 of ''Agricola'',<ref>''Agricola'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#24|24]]</ref> does not tell us what body of water he crossed, although most scholars believe it was the Clyde or Forth, and some translators even add the name of their preferred river to the text; however, the rest of the chapter exclusively concerns [[Ireland]], so southwest Scotland is perhaps to be preferred.<ref>W.S. Hanson 1991 ''Agricola and the conquest of the north'', (2nd edn) Batsford, London, pp. 93-96</ref> The text of the ''Agricola'' has been amended here to record the Romans \"crossing into trackless wastes\", referring to the wilds of the Galloway peninsula.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Duncan B.|title=Mons Graupius AD 83: Rome's battle at the edge of the world|date=2010|publisher=Osprey|location=Oxford|isbn=9781846039263}}</ref> Agricola fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single [[Roman legion|legion]] and [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]]. He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest never happened, but some historians believe the crossing referred to was in fact a small-scale exploratory or [[punitive expedition]] to Ireland,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Di Martino|first1=Vittorio|title=Roman Ireland|date=2006|publisher=Collins|location=Cork|isbn=9781905172191}}</ref> though no Roman camps have been identified to confirm such a suggestion.<ref>See, in general, {{cite journal |first=Duncan B. |last=Campbell |title=Did the Romans invade Ireland? |journal=Ancient Warfare|volume=8|issue=2|date=2014|pages=48\u201352}}</ref>\n\n[[Irish legend]] provides a striking parallel. [[Tuathal Teachtmhar]], a legendary [[High King of Ireland|High King]], is said to have been exiled from Ireland as a boy, and to have returned from Britain at the head of an army to claim the throne. The traditional date of his return is 76\u201380, and [[archaeology]] has found Roman or Romano-British artefacts in several sites associated with Tuathal.<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. B. |last=Warner |date=1995 |title=Tuathal Techtmar: a myth or ancient literary evidence for a Roman invasion?| journal=Emania|issue=13|url=https://www.academia.edu/7149513/Tuathal_Techtmar_a_myth_or_ancient_literary_evidence_for_a_Roman_invasion}}</ref>\n\n===The invasion of Caledonia (Scotland)===\n[[File:Agricola.Campaigns.80.84.jpg|frameless|right|200px]]\nThe following year, Agricola raised a fleet and encircled the tribes beyond the Forth, and the [[Caledonians]] rose in great numbers against him. They attacked the camp of the ''[[Legio IX Hispana]]'' at [[Night combat|night]], but Agricola sent in his cavalry and they were put to flight. The Romans responded by pushing further north. Another son was born to Agricola this year, but died before his first birthday.\n\nIn the summer of 83, Agricola faced the massed armies of the Caledonians, led by [[Calgacus]], at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]].<ref>On the battle in general, see Duncan B. Campbell, ''Mons Grapius AD 83'' (2010), pp. 57-83.</ref> Tacitus estimates their numbers at more than 30,000.<ref>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#29|29]]</ref> Agricola put his auxiliaries in the front line, keeping the legions in reserve, and relied on close-quarters fighting to make the Caledonians' unpointed slashing swords useless as they were unable to swing them properly or utilise thrusting attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0081:chapter=36|title=Cornelius Tacitus, The Life of Cn\u00e6us Julius Agricola, chapter 36|author=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref> Even though the Caledonians were put to rout and therefore lost this battle, two thirds of their army managed to escape and hide in the Highlands or the \"trackless wilds\" as Tacitus calls them. Battle casualties were estimated by Tacitus to be about 10,000 on the Caledonian side and 360 on the Roman side.\n\nA number of authors have reckoned the battle to have occurred in the [[Grampian Mountains|Grampian]] [[Mounth]] within sight of the [[North Sea]].<ref>On the battle's location, see Duncan B. Campbell, \"Search for a lost battlefield\", ''Ancient Warfare'' Vol. 8 issue 1 (2014), pp. 47-51.</ref> In particular, Roy,<ref>William Roy, ''The Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain'', 1793</ref> Surenne, Watt, Hogan<ref name=\"Hogan\">C. Michael Hogan, ''Elsick Mounth'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18037 Megalithic.co.uk]</ref> and others have advanced notions that the site of the battle may have been [[Kempstone Hill]], [[Megray Hill]] or other knolls near the [[Raedykes]] [[Roman camp]]; these points of high ground are proximate to the [[Elsick Mounth]], an ancient [[trackway]] used by Romans and Caledonians for military manoeuvres. However, following the discovery of the [[Roman camp]] at [[Durno]] in 1975, most scholars now believe that the battle took place on the ground around [[Bennachie]] in Aberdeenshire.<ref>{{cite journal|first=J.K. |last=St Joseph |title=The camp at Durno, Aberdeenshire, and the site of Mons Graupius |journal=Britannia |volume=9 |date=1978 |pages=271\u2013287}}</ref>\n\nSatisfied with his victory, Agricola extracted hostages from the Caledonian tribes. He may have marched his army to the northern coast of Britain,<ref>{{cite web|first=Stan |last=Wolfson |date=2002 |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/fartherlands/appendix.html |title=The Boresti: The creation of a myth|website=Tacitus, Thule and Caledonia}} In the manuscript of Agricola 38.2: ''In finis Borestorum exercitum deducit'' - He led his army down into the territory of the Boresti\" may be emended to: ''in finis boreos totum exercitum deducit'' - He led his entire army down into the northern extremities\"</ref> as evidenced by the probable discovery of a Roman fort at [[Cawdor]] (near [[Inverness]]).<ref>[http://her.highland.gov.uk/hbsmrgatewayhighland/DataFiles/LibraryLinkFiles/38961.pdf Excavations at Cawdor 1986]</ref>\n\nHe also instructed the [[prefect]] of the fleet to sail around the north coast, confirming (allegedly for the first time) that Britain was in fact an island.\n\n==Later years==\nAgricola was recalled from Britain in 85, after an unusually long tenure as governor. Tacitus claims [[Domitian]] ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germany. He re-entered Rome unobtrusively, reporting as ordered to the palace at night. The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear; on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue (the highest military honours apart from an actual [[Roman triumph|triumph]]); on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post, in spite of his experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa, but declined it, whether due to ill health or (as Tacitus claims) the machinations of Domitian.\nIn 93, Agricola died on his family estates in Gallia Narbonensis aged fifty-three.  Rumours circulated attributing the death to a poison administered by the Emperor Domitian, but no positive evidence for this was ever produced.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cawdor (Roman Fort)]]\n* [[History of Northumberland]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Anthony Birley]] (1996), \u201cIulius Agricola, Cn.\u201d, in Hornblower, Simon, ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', Oxford: Oxford University Press\n* [[Duncan B.

\u03b2-N<sub>9</sub>-[[glycosidic bond]]. Guanosine can be [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] to become [[guanosine monophosphate]] (GMP), [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] (cGMP), [[guanosine diphosphate]] (GDP), and [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP). These forms play important roles in various biochemical processes such as synthesis of [[nucleic acid]]s and proteins, [[photosynthesis]], muscle contraction, and intracellular signal transduction (cGMP). When guanine is attached by its N9 nitrogen to the C1 carbon of a [[deoxyribose]] ring it is known as [[deoxyguanosine]].\n\nThe antiviral drug [[acyclovir]], often used in herpes treatment, and the anti-HIV drug [[abacavir]], are structurally similar to guanosine.\n\nGuanosine is required for an [[RNA splicing]] reaction in mRNA, when a \"self-splicing\" [[intron]] removes itself from the mRNA message by cutting at both ends, re-ligating, and leaving just the [[exon]]s on either side to be translated into protein.<ref>[http://blogs.scienceforums.net/ecoli/files/2008/04/introns.jpg Splicing (JPG)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613194157/http://blogs.scienceforums.net/ecoli/files/2008/04/introns.jpg |date=June 13, 2010 }}</ref>\n[[File:GuanosinN.png|thumb|left|Guanosine with numbered carbons]]\nGuanosine was used to make [[Regadenoson]].\n{{clear}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Nucleobases, nucleosides, and nucleotides}}\n{{Purinergics}}\n\n[[Category:Nucleosides]]\n[[Category:Purines]]", "sha1": "fk1qorkqvqd1nt82yrrc9y8d913ecva"}}, {"title": "G\u00f6del's ontological proof", "ns": "0", "id": "12420", "revision": {"id": "855526375", "parentid": "855150467", "timestamp": "2018-08-18T23:42:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "Uanfala", "id": "11049176"}, "comment": "rm maintenance template: the sections that do need footnotes, have them", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''G\u00f6del's ontological proof''' is a formal argument by the mathematician [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] (1906\u20131978) for [[God]]'s existence. More precisely, it presupposes the notion of ''positive'' and ''negative'' properties, and proves the necessary existence of an object which each positive property, but no negative property, applies to.\n\nThe argument is in a line of development that goes back to [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033\u20131109).  St. Anselm's [[ontological argument]], in its most succinct form, is as follows: \"God, by definition, is that for which no greater can be conceived. God exists in the understanding. If God exists in the understanding, we could imagine Him to be greater by existing in [[reality]]. Therefore, God must exist.\" A more elaborate version was given by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646\u20131716); this is the version that G\u00f6del studied and attempted to clarify with his ontological argument.\n\nG\u00f6del left a fourteen-point outline of his philosophical beliefs in his papers.<ref>In: Wang, Hao. ''A Logical Journey: From G\u00f6del to Philosophy.'' A Bradford Book, 1997. Print. p.316.</ref> Points relevant to the ontological proof include\n:4. There are other worlds and rational beings of a different and higher kind.\n:5. The world in which we live is not the only one in which we shall live or have lived.\n:13. There is a scientific (exact) philosophy and theology, which deals with concepts of the highest abstractness; and this is also most highly fruitful for science.\n:14. Religions are, for the most part, bad\u2014but religion is not.\n\n== History ==\nThe first version of the ontological proof in G\u00f6del's papers is dated \"around 1941\". G\u00f6del is not known to have told anyone about his work on the proof until 1970, when he thought he was dying. In February, he allowed [[Dana Scott]] to copy out a version of the proof, which circulated privately. In August 1970, G\u00f6del told [[Oskar Morgenstern]] that he was \"satisfied\" with the proof, but Morgenstern recorded in his diary entry for 29 August 1970, that G\u00f6del would not publish because he was afraid that others might think \"that he actually believes in God, whereas he is only engaged in a logical investigation (that is, in showing that such a proof with classical assumptions (completeness, etc.) correspondingly axiomatized, is possible).\"<ref>Quoted in G\u00f6del 1995, p. 388. The German original is quoted in Dawson 1997, p. 307. The nested parentheses are in Morgenstern's original diary entry, as quoted by Dawson.</ref> G\u00f6del died January 14, 1978. Another version, slightly different from Scott's, was found in his papers. It was finally published, together with Scott's version, in 1987.<ref>The publication history of the proof in this paragraph is from G\u00f6del 1995, p. 388</ref>\n\nMorgenstern's diary is an important and usually reliable source for G\u00f6del's later years, but the implication of the August 1970 diary entry\u2014that G\u00f6del did not believe in God\u2014is not consistent with the other evidence. In letters to his mother, who was not a churchgoer and had raised Kurt and his brother as freethinkers,<ref>Dawson 1997, pp. 6.</ref> G\u00f6del argued at length for a belief in an afterlife.<ref>Dawson 1997, pp. 210\u2013212.</ref> He did the same in an interview with a skeptical [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]], who said: \"I expressed my doubts as G spoke [...] G\u00f6del smiled as he replied to my questions, obviously aware that his answers were not convincing me.\"<ref>Wang 1996, p. 317. The ellipsis is Wikipedia's.</ref> Wang reports that G\u00f6del's wife, Adele, two days after G\u00f6del's death, told Wang that \"G\u00f6del, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning.\"<ref>Wang 1996, p. 51.</ref> In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, G\u00f6del described his religion as \"baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is ''[[Theism|theistic]]'', not [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], following [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] rather than [[Spinoza]].\"<ref group=note>G\u00f6del's answer to a special questionnaire sent him by the sociologist Burke Grandjean. This answer is quoted directly in Wang 1987, p. 18, and indirectly in Wang 1996, p. 112. It's also quoted directly in Dawson 1997, p. 6,\nwho cites Wang 1987.\n\nThe Grandjean questionnaire is perhaps the most extended autobiographical item in G\u00f6del's papers. G\u00f6del filled it out in pencil and wrote a cover letter, but he never returned it. \"Theistic\" is italicized in both Wang 1987 and Wang 1996. It is possible that this italicization is Wang's and not G\u00f6del's.\n\nThe quote follows Wang 1987, with two corrections taken from Wang 1996. Wang 1987 reads \"Baptist Lutheran\" where Wang 1996 has \"baptized Lutheran\". \"Baptist Lutheran\" makes no sense, especially in context, and was presumably a typo or mistranscription. Wang 1987 has \"rel. cong.\", which in Wang 1996 is expanded to \"religious congregation\".</ref>\n\n==Outline==\n\nThe proof uses [[modal logic]], which distinguishes between [[logical truth|''necessary'' truths]] and [[Contingency (philosophy)|''contingent'' truths]]. In the most common semantics for modal logic, many \"[[Modal logic#Semantics|possible worlds]]\" are considered. A [[truth]] is ''necessary'' if it is true in all possible worlds. By contrast, a truth is ''contingent'' if it just happens to be the case. For instance, \"more than half of this planet is covered by water\" is a contingent truth, that relies upon which planet \"this planet\" is. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is false in another world, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some world (not necessarily our own) is called a ''[[logically possible|possible]]'' truth.\n\nFurthermore, the proof uses [[higher-order logic|higher-order]] (modal) logic because the definition of God employs an explicit quantification over properties.<ref>Fitting, 2002, p. 139</ref>\n\nFirst, G\u00f6del axiomatizes the notion of a \"positive property\":<ref group=note>This assumes that it is possible to single out ''positive'' properties from among all properties. G\u00f6del comments that \"Positive means positive in the [[moral]] [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] sense (independently of the accidental structure of the world)... It may also mean pure ''attribution'' as opposed to ''privation'' (or containing privation).\" (G\u00f6del 1995), see also manuscript in (Gawlick 2012).</ref> for each property ''\u03c6'', either ''\u03c6'' or its [[negation]] \u00ac''\u03c6'' must be positive, but not both (axiom 2). If a positive property ''\u03c6'' implies a property ''\u03c8'' in each possible world, then ''\u03c8'' is positive, too (axiom 1). G\u00f6del then argues that each positive property is \"possibly exemplified\", i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1). Defining an object to be Godlike if it has all positive properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be positive itself (axiom 3),<ref group=note>Axioms 1, 2 and 3 can be summarized by saying that positive properties form a principal [[ultrafilter]].</ref> G\u00f6del shows that in ''some'' possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2), called \"God\" in the following.<ref group=note>By removing all modal operators from axioms, definitions, proofs, and theorems, a modified version of theorem 2 is obtained saying \"\u2203''x'' ''G''(''x'')\", i.e. \"There exists an object which has all positive, but no negative properties\". Nothing more than axioms 1-3, definition 1, and theorems 1-2 needs to be considered for this result.</ref> G\u00f6del proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in ''every'' possible world.\n\nTo this end, he defines ''essences'': if ''x'' is an object in some world, then a property ''\u03c6'' is said to be an essence of ''x'' if ''\u03c6''(''x'') is true in that world and if ''\u03c6'' necessarily entails all other properties that ''x'' has in that world (definition 2). Requiring positive properties being positive in every possible world (axiom 4), G\u00f6del can show that Godlikeness is an essence of a Godlike object (theorem 3). Now, ''x'' is said to ''exist necessarily'' if, for every essence ''\u03c6'' of ''x'', there is an element ''y'' with property ''\u03c6'' in every possible world (definition 3). Axiom 5 requires necessary existence to be a positive property.\n\nHence, it must follow from Godlikeness. Moreover, Godlikeness is an essence of God, since it entails all positive properties, and any non-positive property is the negation of some positive property, so God cannot have any non-positive properties. Since necessary existence is also a positive property (axiom 5), it must be a property of every Godlike object, as every Godlike object has all the positive properties (definition 1). Since any Godlike object is necessarily existent, it follows that any Godlike object in one world is a Godlike object in all worlds, by the definition of necessary existence. Given the existence of a Godlike object in one world, proven above, we may conclude that there is a Godlike object in every possible world, as required (theorem 4). Besides axiom 1-5 and definition 1-3, a few other axioms from modal logic{{clarify|reason=They should be stated.|date=August 2016}} were tacitly used in the proof.\n\nFrom these hypotheses, it is also possible to prove that there is only one God in each world by Leibniz's law, the [[identity of indiscernibles]]: two or more objects are identical (the same) if they have all their properties in common, and so, there would only be one object in each world that possesses property G. G\u00f6del did not attempt to do so however, as he purposely limited his proof to the issue of existence, rather than uniqueness.\n\n===Symbolic notation===\n\n<math>\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n\n\\text{Ax. 1.} & \\left(P(\\varphi) \\;\\wedge\\; \\Box \\; \\forall x (\\varphi(x) \\Rightarrow \\psi(x))\\right) \\;\\Rightarrow\\; P(\\psi) \\\\\n\n\\text{Ax. 2.} & P(\\neg \\varphi) \\;\\Leftrightarrow\\; \\neg P(\\varphi) \\\\\n\n\\text{Th. 1.} & P(\\varphi) \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\Diamond \\; \\exists x \\; \\varphi(x) \\\\\n\n\\text{Df. 1.} & G(x) \\;\\Leftrightarrow\\; \\forall \\varphi (P(\\varphi) \\Rightarrow \\varphi(x)) \\\\\n\n\\text{Ax. 3.} & P(G) \\\\\n\n\\text{Th. 2.} & \\Diamond \\; \\exists x \\; G(x) \\\\\n\n\\text{Df. 2.} & \\varphi \\text{ ess } x \\;\\Leftrightarrow\\; \\varphi(x) \\wedge \\forall \\psi \\left(\\psi(x) \\Rightarrow \\Box \\; \\forall y (\\varphi(y) \\Rightarrow \\psi(y))\\right) \\\\\n\n\\text{Ax. 4.} & P(\\varphi) \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\Box \\; P(\\varphi) \\\\\n\n\\text{Th. 3.} & G(x) \\;\\Rightarrow\\; G \\text{ ess } x \\\\\n\t\t\n\\text{Df. 3.} & E(x) \\;\\Leftrightarrow\\; \\forall \\varphi (\\varphi \\text{ ess } x \\Rightarrow \\Box \\; \\exists y \\; \\varphi(y)) \\\\\n\t\t\t\n\\text{Ax. 5.} & P(E) \\\\\n\t\t\t\n\\text{Th. 4.} & \\Box \\; \\exists x \\; G(x)\n  \n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nThere is an ongoing open-source effort to formalize G\u00f6del's proof to a level that is suitable for [[automated theorem proving]] or at least computer verification via [[proof assistant]]s.<ref>https://github.com/FormalTheology/GoedelGod</ref>  The effort made headlines in German newspapers.

This is particularly applicable to G\u00f6del's proof \u2013 because it rests on five axioms, some of which are questionable. A proof does not necessitate that the conclusion be correct, but rather that by accepting the axioms, the conclusion follows logically.\n\nMany philosophers have questioned the axioms. The first layer of attack is simply that there are no arguments presented that give reasons why the axioms are true. A second layer is that these particular axioms lead to unwelcome conclusions. This line of thought was argued by [[Jordan Howard Sobel]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Jordan Howard Sobel | authorlink=Jordan Howard Sobel|contribution=G\u00f6del's ontological proof | pages=241\u2013261 | isbn=978-0262200639 | editor=Judith Jarvis Thomson |editorlink=Judith Jarvis Thomson | title=On Being and Saying: Essays for Richard Cartwright | location=Cambridge/MA & London, England | publisher=MIT Press | date=Nov 1987 }}</ref> showing that if the axioms are accepted, they lead to a \"modal collapse\" where every statement that is true is necessarily true, i.e. the sets of necessary, of contingent, and of possible truths all coincide (provided there are [[accessibility relation|accessible]] worlds at all).<ref group=note>Formally, <math>p \\Rightarrow \\Box p</math> for all ''p'' implies <math>\\Diamond p \\Rightarrow p</math> for all ''p'' by [[indirect proof]], and <math>\\Box p \\Rightarrow \\Diamond p</math> holds for all ''p'' whenever there are accessible worlds.</ref> According to Koons,<ref name=\"Koons.2005\"/>{{rp|9}} Sobel suggested that G\u00f6del might have welcomed modal collapse.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=0-19-507255-3 | url=https://monoskop.org/images/a/aa/Kurt_G%C3%B6del_Collected_Works_Volume_III_1995.pdf | author=Kurt G\u00f6del |editor1 = Solomon Feferman | editor2= John W.

The broader criticism is that even if the axioms cannot be shown to be false, that does not mean that they are true. Hilbert's famous [[Synthetic geometry#Logical synthesis|remark]] about interchangeability of the primitives' names applies to those in G\u00f6del's ontological axioms (''\"positive\", \"god-like\", \"essence\"'') as well as to those in Hilbert's geometry axioms (''\"point\", \"line\", \"plane\"''). According to [[Andr\u00e9 Fuhrmann]] (2005) it remains to show that the dazzling notion prescribed by traditions and often believed to be essentially mysterious satisfies G\u00f6del's axioms. This is not a mathematical, but merely a theological task.<ref>{{cite book | contributionurl=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19453127/Homepage/downloads/GoedelExistenzNotwendigkeit.pdf | author=Andr\u00e9 Fuhrmann | chapter=Existenz und Notwendigkeit &mdash; Kurt G\u00f6dels axiomatische Theologie |trans-chapter=Existence and Necessity &mdash; Kurt G\u00f6del's Axiomatic Theology | language=German | pages=349&mdash;374 | editor=W.

The results are computer programs that are able to perform well in a predefined task. The methods used to encode a computer program in an artificial chromosome and to evaluate its fitness with respect to the predefined task are central in the GP technique and still the subject of active research.\n\n==History==\nThe first record of the proposal to evolve programs is probably that of Alan Turing<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~wbl/biblio/gp-html/oai_cogprints_soton_ac_uk_499.html|title=Computing Machinery and Intelligence|website=www.cs.bham.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-19}}</ref> in the 1950s.

[[Cartesian genetic programming]] is another form of GP, which uses a graph representation instead of the usual tree based representation to encode computer programs.\n\nMost representations have structurally noneffective code ([[intron]]s). Such non-coding genes may seem to be useless, because they have no effect on the performance of any one individual.  However, they alter the probabilities of generating different offspring under the variation operators, and thus alter the individual's [[variational properties]].\nExperiments seem to show faster convergence when using program representations that allow such non-coding genes, compared to program representations that do not have any non-coding genes.<ref>\nJulian F. Miller.\n[https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642173097-c2.pdf \"Cartesian Genetic Programming\"].\np. 19.</ref><ref>\nJanet Clegg; James Alfred Walker; Julian Francis Miller.\n[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~wbl/biblio/gecco2007/docs/p1580.pdf A New Crossover Technique for Cartesian Genetic Programming\"].\n2007.\n</ref>\n\n===Selection===\nSelection is a process whereby certain individuals are selected from the current generation that would serve as parents for the next generation. The individuals are selected probabilistically such that the better performing individuals have a higher chance of getting selected<ref name=\"field guide\" />. The most commonly used selection method in GP is [[Tournament selection]], although other methods such as [[Fitness proportionate selection]], Lexicase Selection<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spector|first=Lee|title=Assessment of problem modality by differential performance of lexicase selection in genetic programming: a preliminary report|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2330846|journal=Proceedings of the 14th annual conference companion on Genetic and evolutionary computation.|language=en-US|publisher=ACM}}</ref>, and many others have been demonstrated to perform better for many GP problems.\n\n===Variation===\nVarious genetic operators (i.e., crossover and mutation) are applied to the individuals selected in the selection step described above to breed new individuals. The rate at which these operators are applied determine the diversity in the population.\n\n==Applications==\nGP has been successfully used as an [[automatic programming]] tool, a machine learning tool and an automatic problem-solving engine<ref name=\"field guide\" />. GP is especially useful in the domains where the exact form of the \nsolution is not known in advance or an approximates solution is acceptable (possibly because finding the exact solution is very difficult). Some of the applications of GP are curve fitting, data modeling, [[Symbolic regression]], feature selection, classification, etc. John R. Koza mentions 76\ninstances where Genetic Programming has been able to produce results that are competitive with human-produced results (called Human-competitive results)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koza|first=John R|title=Human-competitive results produced by genetic programming|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10710-010-9112-3|journal=Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines|language=en-US|publisher= Springer}}</ref>. Since 2004, the annual Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) holds Human Competitive Awards (called Humies) competition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.human-competitive.org/awards|title=Humn =Human-Competitive Awards|publisher=}}</ref>, where cash awards are presented to human-competitive results produced by any form of genetic and evolutionary computation. GP has won many awards in this competition over the years.\n\n==Meta-genetic programming==\nMeta-genetic programming is the proposed [[meta learning (computer science)|meta learning]] technique of evolving a genetic programming system using genetic programming itself. It suggests that chromosomes, crossover, and mutation were themselves evolved, therefore like their real life counterparts should be allowed to change on their own rather than being determined by a human programmer. Meta-GP was formally proposed by [[J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber]] in 1987<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/diploma.html|title=1987 THESIS ON LEARNING HOW TO LEARN, METALEARNING, META GENETIC PROGRAMMING,CREDIT-CONSERVING MACHINE LEARNING ECONOMY|publisher=}}</ref>. [[Douglas Lenat|Doug Lenat]]'s [[Eurisko]] is an earlier effort that may be the same technique. It is a recursive but terminating algorithm, allowing it to avoid infinite recursion. In the \"autoconstructive evolution\" approach to meta-genetic programming, the methods for the production and variation of offspring are encoded within the evolving programs themselves, and programs are executed to produce new programs to be added to the population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spector|first=Lee|last2=Robinson|first2=Alan|date=2002-03-01|title=Genetic Programming and Autoconstructive Evolution with the Push Programming Language|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014538503543|journal=Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7\u201340|doi=10.1023/A:1014538503543|issn=1389-2576}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987011786|title=GECCO '16 Companion : proceedings of the 2016 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference : July 20-24, 2016, Denver, Colorado, USA|others=Neumann, Frank (Computer scientist), Association for Computing Machinery. SIGEVO,|isbn=9781450343237|location=New York, New York|oclc=987011786}}</ref>\n\nCritics of this idea often say this approach is overly broad in scope. However, it might be possible to constrain the fitness criterion onto a general class of results, and so obtain an evolved GP that would more efficiently produce results for sub-classes. This might take the form of a meta evolved GP for producing human walking algorithms which is then used to evolve human running, jumping, etc. The fitness criterion applied to the meta GP would simply be one of efficiency.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Bio-inspired computing]]\n* [[CMA-ES|Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy]] (CMA-ES)\n* [[Fitness approximation]]\n* [[Gene expression programming]]\n* [[Genetic improvement]]\n* [[Genetic representation]]\n* [[Grammatical evolution]]\n* [[Inductive programming]]\n* [[Linear genetic programming]]\n* [[Multi expression programming]]\n* [[Propagation of schema]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070813222058/http://uk.geocities.com/markcsinclair/abstracts.html#pro00a/ Aymen S Saket & Mark C Sinclair]\n* [https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10710 ''Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines''], a journal\n* [http://www.modulusfe.com/products/trading-system-developer-components/evo2-genetic-algorithm/ ''Evo2 for genetic programming'']\n* [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~wbl/biblio/README.html GP bibliography]\n* [http://www.etsimo.uniovi.es/ftp/pub/EC/FAQ/www/ The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to Evolutionary Computation]\n* Riccardo Poli, William B.

Klimt is noted for his paintings, [[mural]]s, [[sketch (drawing)|sketches]], and other [[objets d'art]]. Klimt's primary subject was the female body,{{Sfn | Fliedl | 1994 | p = 14 | ps =. The most important element of his fame is his reputation as a master of eroticism.}} and his works are marked by a frank eroticism.{{Sfn | Sabarsky | 1983 | p = 18}} In addition to his figurative works, which include allegories and portraits, he painted landscapes. Among the artists of the Vienna Secession, Klimt was the most influenced by [[Japanese art]] and its methods.\n\nEarly in his artistic career, he was a successful painter of architectural decorations in a conventional manner. As he developed a more personal style, his work was the subject of controversy that culminated when the paintings he completed around 1900 for the ceiling of the Great Hall of the [[University of Vienna]] were criticized as pornographic. He subsequently accepted no more public commissions, but achieved a new success with the paintings of his \"golden phase\", many of which include gold leaf. Klimt's work was an important influence on his younger contemporary [[Egon Schiele]].\n\n==Life and work==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Gustav Klimt in 1887.jpg|thumb|Gustav Klimt in 1887]]\n[[File:Egon Schiele - Gustav Klimt im blauen Malerkittel - 1913.jpeg|thumb|right|''Klimt in a light Blue Smock'' by [[Egon Schiele]], 1913]]\n\nGustav Klimt was born in [[Baumgarten, Vienna|Baumgarten]], near [[Vienna]] in Austria-Hungary, the second of seven children\u2014three boys and four girls.{{Sfn | Fliedl | 1994 | p = 230}} His mother, Anna Klimt (''n\u00e9e'' Finster), had an unrealized ambition to be a musical performer. His father, Ernst Klimt the Elder, formerly from [[Bohemia]], was a gold engraver.{{Sfn | Sabarsky | 1983 | p = 7}} All three of their sons displayed artistic talent early on. Klimt's younger brothers were [[Ernst Klimt]] and Georg Klimt.\n\nKlimt lived in poverty while attending the Vienna [[Kunstgewerbeschule]], a school of applied arts and crafts, now the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]], where he studied [[architectural painting]] from 1876 until 1883.{{Sfn | Sabarsky | 1983 | p = 7}}<ref>Bailey, Colin B., Peter Vergo, Emily Braun, Jane Kallir, and John Collins (2001). ''Gustav Klimt: Modernism in the Making''. New York: Abrams. p. 55. {{ISBN|0888847181}}.</ref> He revered Vienna's foremost history painter of the time, [[Hans Makart]]. Klimt readily accepted the principles of a conservative training; his early work may be classified as academic.{{Sfn | Sabarsky | 1983 | p = 7}} In 1877 his brother, Ernst, who, like his father, would become an engraver, also enrolled in the school. The two brothers and their friend, Franz Matsch, began working together and by 1880 they had received numerous commissions as a team that they called the \"Company of Artists\". They also helped their teacher in painting murals in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.{{Sfn | Sabarsky | 1983 | p = 7}} Klimt began his professional career painting interior murals and ceilings in large public buildings on the [[Ringstra\u00dfe]], including a successful series of \"Allegories and Emblems\".\n\nIn 1888 Klimt received the Golden Order of Merit from Emperor [[Franz Josef I of Austria]] for his contributions to murals painted in the [[Burgtheater]] in Vienna.{{Sfn | Sabarsky | 1983 | p = 7}} He also became an honorary member of the [[University of Munich]] and the [[University of Vienna]]. In 1892 Klimt's father and brother Ernst both died, and he had to assume financial responsibility for his father's and brother's families. The tragedies also affected his artistic vision and soon he would move towards a new personal style. \nCharacteristic of his style at the end of the 19th century is the inclusion of ''[[Veritas|Nuda Veritas]]'' (''naked truth'') as a symbolic figure in some of his works, including ''Ancient Greece and Egypt'' (1891), ''Pallas Athene'' (1898) and ''Nuda Veritas'' (1899).<ref>[http://kurier.at/kultur/gegen-klimt-vielen-gefallen-ist-schlimm/787.186/slideshow ''Against Klimt.''] Article in Kurier, May 12, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.theatermuseum.at/vor-dem-vorhang/ausstellungen/nuda-veritas/ Nuda Veritas, Gustav Klimt.] Article on the Website of the [[Austrian Theatre Museum]].</ref> Historians believe that Klimt with the ''nuda veritas'' denounced both the policy of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] and the Austrian society, which ignored all political and social problems of that time.<ref>Jane Rogoyska, Patrick Bade: ''Gustav Klimt'', page 30.

His painting, [[The Kiss (Klimt)|''The Kiss'']] (1907\u201308), is thought to be an image of them as lovers. He designed many costumes that she produced and modeled in his works.\n\nDuring this period Klimt fathered at least fourteen children.<ref>{{Citation | first = John | last = Collins | title = Klimt: Modernism In The Making | publisher = Harry N.

He remained with the Secession until 1908. The goals of the group were to provide exhibitions for unconventional young artists, to bring the works of the best foreign artists to Vienna, and to publish its own magazine to showcase the work of members.{{Sfn | Whitford | 1990 | p = 69}} The group declared no [[manifesto]] and did not set out to encourage any particular style\u2014[[Naturalist school of painting|Naturalists]], [[Realism (arts)|Realists]], and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] all coexisted.

The group's symbol was [[Pallas Athena]], the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] goddess of just causes, wisdom, and the arts\u2014of whom Klimt painted his radical version in 1898.<ref>Klimt's radical version of [http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/gustav-klimt/minerva-or-pallas-athena Pallas Athena]</ref>\n[[File:Gustav Klimt, Judith II.jpg|alt=|thumb|215x215px|''Judith II'' (1909)]]\nIn 1894, Klimt was commissioned to create [[Klimt University of Vienna Ceiling Paintings|three paintings]] to decorate the ceiling of the Great Hall of the [[University of Vienna]]. Not completed until the turn of the century, his three paintings, ''Philosophy'', ''Medicine'', and ''Jurisprudence'' were criticized for their radical themes and material, and were called \"[[pornography|pornographic]]\".{{Sfn | Sabarsky | 1983 | p = 9}} Klimt had transformed traditional [[allegory]] and symbolism into a new language that was more overtly sexual and hence more disturbing to some.{{Sfn | Sabarsky | 1983 | p = 9}} The public outcry came from all quarters\u2014political, aesthetic and religious. As a result, the paintings ''(seen in gallery below)'' were not displayed on the ceiling of the Great Hall. This would be the last public commission accepted by the artist.\n\nAll three paintings were destroyed when retreating German forces burned [[Schloss Immendorf]] in May 1945.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rogoyska|first1=Jane|last2=Bade|first2=Patrick|title=Gustav Klimt|date=2011|publisher=Parkstone Press International|location=New York|isbn=1-78042-729-8|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3b0asmVCtAC&lpg=PA87&dq=Philosophy%2C%20Medicine%2C%20and%20Jurisprudence%20klimt%20ss&pg=PA87#v=onepage&q&f=false|chapter=Compositional Project for Medicine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://open.salon.com/blog/sheilatgtg55/2011/10/11/the_fire_at_schloss_immendorf | title= The Fire At Schloss Immendorf | publisher = [[Open Salon]] | date=October 13, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014095858/http://open.salon.com/blog/sheilatgtg55/2011/10/11/the_fire_at_schloss_immendorf |archivedate=October 14, 2011 |author=SheilaTGTG55}}</ref>\n\nHis ''Nuda Veritas'' (1899) defined his bid to further \"shake up\" the establishment.<ref name=\"Klimt Nuda Veritas 1899\">{{cite web|url=http://www.klimt.com/en/gallery/early-works/klimt-nuda-veritas-1899.ihtml |title=Gustav Klimt Painting - Early Works / Nuda Veritas 1899 / Klimt Gallery &#124; Klimt Museum &#124; KLIMT.com Museum |publisher=Klimt.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-05}}</ref> The starkly naked red-headed woman holds the mirror of truth, while above her is a quotation by [[Friedrich Schiller]] in stylized lettering: \"If you cannot please everyone with your deeds and your art, please only a few.

Intended for the exhibition only, the frieze was painted directly on the walls with light materials. After the exhibition the painting was preserved, although it was not displayed again until 1986. The face on the Beethoven portrait resembled the composer and Vienna Court Opera director [[Gustav Mahler]].<ref>Johnson, Julian, ''Mahler's Voices: Expression and Irony in the Songs and Symphonies''. Oxford University Press (Oxford, UK), {{ISBN|978-0-19-537239-7}}, p. 235 (2009).</ref>\n\nDuring this period Klimt did not confine himself to public commissions. Beginning in the late 1890s he took annual summer holidays with the Fl\u00f6ge family on the shores of [[Attersee (lake)|Attersee]] and painted many of his landscapes there. These landscapes constitute the only genre aside from [[figure painting]] that seriously interested Klimt. In recognition of his intensity, the locals called him Waldschrat (\"forest demon\").<ref>{{Citation | last = Koja | first = Stephan | others = et al | title = Gustav Klimt Landscapes | page = 27 | publisher = Prestel | year = 2002}}</ref>\n\nKlimt's Attersee paintings are of sufficient number and quality as to merit separate appreciation. Formally, the landscapes are characterized by the same refinement of design and emphatic patterning as the figural pieces. Deep space in the Attersee works is flattened so efficiently to a single plane that it is believed that Klimt painted them by using a telescope.<ref>{{Citation | first = Anselm | last = Wagner | chapter = Klimt's Landscapes and the Telescope | title = Gustav Klimt Landscapes | pages = 161\u201371 | publisher = Prestel | year = 2002}}</ref>\n\n===Golden phase and critical success===\n[[File:The Kiss - Gustav Klimt - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Kiss (Klimt painting)|The Kiss]]'' 1907\u201308, oil on canvas, [[\u00d6sterreichische Galerie Belvedere]], [[Vienna]]]]\n\nKlimt's 'Golden Phase' was marked by positive critical reaction and financial success. Many of his paintings from this period included [[gold leaf]]. Klimt had previously used gold in his ''Pallas Athene'' (1898) and ''[[Judith and the Head of Holofernes|Judith I]]'' (1901), although the works most popularly associated with this period are the ''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'' (1907) and ''[[The Kiss (Klimt painting)|The Kiss]]'' (1907\u201308).\n\nKlimt travelled little, but trips to Venice and [[Ravenna]], both famous for their beautiful mosaics, most likely inspired his gold technique and his [[Byzantine art|Byzantine imagery]]. In 1904, he collaborated with other artists on the lavish [[Stoclet Palace|Palais Stoclet]], the home of a wealthy Belgian industrialist that was one of the grandest monuments of the [[Art Nouveau]] age. Klimt's contributions to the dining room, including both ''Fulfillment'' and ''Expectation'', were some of his finest decorative works, and as he publicly stated, \"probably the ultimate stage of my development of ornament.\"{{Sfn | Whitford | 1990 | p = 103}}\n\nIn 1905, Klimt created a painted portrait of Margarete Wittgenstein, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s sister, on the occasion of her marriage.<ref>Edmunds, D. and Eidenow, J. ''Wittgenstein's Poker: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers,'' 2001, page 83.</ref> Then, between 1907 and 1909, Klimt painted five canvases of society women wrapped in fur. His apparent love of costume is expressed in the many photographs of Fl\u00f6ge modeling clothing he had designed.\n\nAs he worked and relaxed in his home, Klimt normally wore sandals and a long robe with no undergarments. His simple life was somewhat cloistered, devoted to his art, family, and little else except the Secessionist Movement. He avoided caf\u00e9 society and seldom socialized with other artists. Klimt's fame usually brought patrons to his door and he could afford to be highly selective. His painting method was very deliberate and painstaking at times and he required lengthy sittings by his subjects. Although very active sexually, he kept his affairs discreet and he avoided personal scandal.\n\nKlimt wrote little about his vision or his methods. He wrote mostly postcards to Fl\u00f6ge and kept no diary. In a rare writing called \"Commentary on a non-existent self-portrait\", he states \"I have never painted a self-portrait. I am less interested in myself as a subject for a painting than I am in other people, above all women... There is nothing special about me. I am a painter who paints day after day from morning to night&nbsp;... Who ever wants to know something about me&nbsp;... ought to look carefully at my pictures.\"{{Sfn | Whitford | 1990 | p = 18}}\n\nIn 1901 [[Hermann Bahr]] wrote, in his ''Speech on Klimt'': \"Just as only a lover can reveal to a man what life means to him and develop its innermost significance, I feel the same about these paintings.\"<ref>{{Citation | first = Dr. Julia | last = Kelly | chapter = Introduction to Payne, L | year = 2004 | title = Klimt | publisher = Exclusive Editions | ISBN = 1-84461-185-X}}</ref>\n\n===Later life and posthumous success===\n[[File:Gustav Klimt, 1907, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Neue Galerie New York.jpg|thumb|''[[Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'' (1907), which sold for a record $135 million in 2006, [[Neue Galerie New York|Neue Galerie]], New York]]\n\nIn 1911 his painting ''[[Death and Life]]'' received first prize in the [[International Exhibition of Art (1911)|world exhibitions]] in Rome. In 1915 Anna, his mother, died. Klimt died three years later in Vienna on February 6, 1918, having suffered a [[stroke]] and [[pneumonia]] due to the [[1918 flu pandemic|worldwide influenza epidemic of that year]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.iklimt.com/ | title= Timeline and life history | work = iKlimt | accessdate= 2012-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Gilles | last = Neret | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4BdP26ptKcUC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Gustav Klimt: 1862\u20131918 | publisher = Taschen | year = 1999 | page = 84 | ISBN = 3-8228-5980-X}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Alessandra | last = Comini | title = Gustav Klimt | publisher = George Braziller | year = 2001 | page = 5 | ISBN = 0-8076-0806-8}}</ref> He was buried at the [[Hietzinger Cemetery]] in [[Hietzing]], Vienna.

O. Miethke (of Gallerie Miethke, Klimt's exclusive gallery in Vienna) from 1908 to 1914 in an edition of 300, supervised personally by the artist. The first thirty-five editions (I-XXXV) each included an original drawing by Klimt, and the next thirty-five editions (XXXVI-LXX) each with a facsimile signature on the title page.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://new.liveauctioneers.com/item/25083387 | title= Das Werk von Gustav Klimt | work = liveauctioneers | accessdate= 2017-01-14}}</ref> Fifty images depicting Klimt's most important paintings (1893\u20131913) were reproduced using [[collotype]] lithography and mounted on a heavy, cream-colored [[wove paper]] with [[deckle]]d edges. Thirty-one of the images (ten of which are multicolored) are printed on ''[[Chine-coll\u00e9]]''. The remaining nineteen are high quality [[halftones]] prints. Each piece was marked with a unique signet\u2014designed by Klimt\u2014which was impressed into the wove paper in gold metallic ink. The prints were issued in groups of ten to subscribers, in unbound black paper folders [[Paper embossing|embossed]] with Klimt's name. Because of the delicate nature of collotype lithography, as well as the necessity for multicolored prints (a feat difficult to reproduce with collotypes), and Klimt's own desire for perfection, the series that was published in mid-1908 was not completed until 1914.\n\nEach of the fifty prints was categorized among five themes:\n# '''Allegorical''' (which included multicolored prints of ''The Golden Knight'', 1903 and ''The Virgin'', c. 1912)\n# '''Erotic-Symbolist''' (''Water Serpents I'' and ''II'', both c. 1907\u201308 and ''The Kiss'', c. 1908)\n# '''Landscapes''' (''Farm Garden with Sunflowers'', 1907)\n# '''Mythical or Biblical''' (''Pallas Athena'', 1898; ''Judith and The Head of Holofernes'', 1901; and ''Dana\u00eb'', c. 1908)\n# '''Portraits''' (''Emilie Fl\u00f6ge'', 1902)\n\nThe monochrome collotypes as well as the halftone works were printed with a variety of colored inks ranging from sepia to blue and green. Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] was the first to purchase a folio set of ''Das Werk Gustav Klimts'' in 1908.\n\n===''F\u00fcnfundzwanzig Handzeichnungen''===\n''F\u00fcnfundzwanzig Handzeichnungen'' (\"Twenty-five Drawings\") was released the year after Klimt's death. Many of the drawings in the collection were erotic in nature and just as polarizing as his painted works. Published in Vienna in 1919 by Gilhofer & Ranschburg, the edition of 500 features twenty-five monochrome and two-color collotype reproductions, nearly indistinguishable from the original works. While the set was released a year after Klimt's death, some art historians suspect he was involved with production planning due to the meticulous nature of the printing (Klimt had overseen the production of the plates for ''Das Werk Gustav Klimts'', making sure each one was to his exact specifications, a level of quality carried through similarly in ''F\u00fcnfundzwanzig Handzeichnungen''). The first ten editions also each contained an original Klimt drawing.\n\nMany of the works contained in this volume depict erotic scenes of nude women, some of whom are masturbating alone or are coupled in [[sapphic love|sapphic]] embraces.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2rAASKPFnaoC&pg=PA47&dq=Gustav+Klimt,+lesbians&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_1uZVaXVMMi9UbX_i4AJ&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Gustav%20Klimt%2C%20lesbians&f=false Gilles N\u00e9ret, ''Gustav Klimt: 1862-1918'', Taschen, 2000, p. 47], {{ISBN|382285980X}}</ref><ref>Gottfried Fliedl, ''Gustav Klimt, 1862-1918: The World in Female Form'', Taschen, 1997, p. 192, {{ISBN|3822882577}}</ref> When a number of the original drawings were exhibited to the public, at Gallerie Miethke in 1910 and the International Exhibition of Prints and Drawings in Vienna in 1913, they were met by critics and viewers who were hostile towards Klimt's contemporary perspective. There was an audience for Klimt's erotic drawings, however, and fifteen of his drawings were selected by Viennese poet [[Franz Blei]] for his translation of Hellenistic satirist [[Lucian]]'s ''Dialogues of the Courteseans''. The book, limited to 450 copies, provided Klimt the opportunity to show these more lurid depictions of women and avoided censorship thanks to an audience composed of a small group of (mostly male) affluent patrons.\n\n===''Gustav Klimt An Aftermath''===\nComposed in 1931 by editor Max Eisler and printed by the Austrian State Printing Office, ''Gustav Klimt An Aftermath'' was intended to complete the lifetime folio ''Das Werk Gustav Klimts''. The folio contains thirty colored [[collotypes]] (fourteen of which are multicolored) and follows a similar format found in ''Das Werk Gustav Klimts'', replacing the unique Klimt-designed signets with gold-debossed plate numbers. One hundred and fifty sets were produced in English, with twenty of them (Nos. I\u2013XX) presented as a \"gala edition\" bound in gilt leather. The set contains detailed images from previously released works (Hygeia from the University Mural ''Medicine'', 1901; a section of the third University Mural ''Jurisprudence'', 1903), as well as the unfinished paintings (''Adam and Eve'', ''Bridal Progress'').\n\n==Paintings==\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Gustav Klimt - Blind Man - Google Art Project.jpg|''Der Blinde'' (''The Blind Man'') 1896, [[Leopold Museum]]\nFile:Gustav Klimt - Tranquil Pond (Egelsee near Golling, Salzburg) - Google Art Project.jpg|''Stiller Weiher (Egelsee bei Golling, Salzburg)'' (''Tranquil Pond'') 1899, [[Leopold Museum]]\nFile:Schubert-Klimt.jpg|''Schubert am Klavier'' (''Schubert at the Piano'') 1899, Destroyed 1945\nFile:Philosophy-final-state-1907.jpg|''Philosophie'' 1899\u20131907.

Although he sums up so much in his work, about the society in which he found himself\u2014in art historical terms his effect was negligible.

Artists who reinterpreted Klimt's work include [[Slovaks|Slovak]] artist [[Rudolf Fila]].\n\n===Cultural influence===\nSeveral of Klimt's most famous works from his golden period inspired the title sequence for the animated adaptation of the [[manga]] series, ''[[Elfen Lied]]'', in which the art is recreated to fit with the series' own characters and is arranged as a montage with the song \"Lilium\". The opening to the anime ''[[Sound of the Sky]]'' also is largely inspired by Klimt's works, which was also directed by the same director as ''Elfen Lied''. The design of the land of Centopia on the TV series ''[[Mia and Me]]'' is inspired by Klimt's works. The art of the video game [[Transistor (video game)|''Transistor'']] also uses patterns and embellishments inspired by Klimt.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Red, the Transistor and some good ol' Klimt homage...!\" - description of the artwork \"Cloudbank\" by Jen See, art director of \"Transistor\"|url=http://jenzee.deviantart.com/art/Cloudbank-375681152 | accessdate = 2015-01-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Couturier]] [[John Galliano]] found inspiration for the [[Christian Dior]] Spring-Summer 2008 [[haute couture]] collection in Klimt's work.\n\nGustav Klimt and his work have been the subjects of many collector coins and medals, such as the 100 Euro [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2003 coinage|Painting Gold Coin]], issued on November 5, 2003, by the [[Austrian Mint]].

The turn-of-the-century building that his brother [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]] called \"the first real home they ever knew\" (in his memoir ''Harpo Speaks'') was populated with European immigrants, mostly artisans. Just across the street were the oldest [[brownstone]]s in the area, owned by people such as the well-connected Loew Brothers and William Orth. The Marx family lived at this location \"for about 14 years\", Groucho also told Cavett.\n\n[[Image:Early marx brothers with parents.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|The only known photo of all five Marx brothers with their parents in New York City, 1915; from left: Groucho, Gummo, Minnie (mother), Zeppo, Frenchie (father), Chico, and Harpo]]\nMarx's family was [[Jewish]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Gary Baum|title=L.A.'s Power Golf Clubs: Where the Hollywood Elite Play|date=June 23, 2011|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/las-power-golf-clubs-hollywood-205072|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> Groucho's mother was [[Minnie Marx|Miene \"Minnie\" Schoenberg]], whose family came from [[Dornum]] in northern Germany when she was 16 years old.

According to Groucho, when Shean visited, he would throw the local waifs a few coins so that when he knocked at the door he would be surrounded by adoring fans. Marx and his brothers respected his opinions and asked him on several occasions to write some material for them.\n\nMinnie Marx did not have an entertainment industry career but had intense ambition for her sons to go on the stage like their uncle. While pushing her eldest son Leonard ([[Chico Marx]]) in piano lessons, she found that Julius had a pleasant soprano voice and the ability to remain on key. Julius's early career goal was to become a doctor, but the family's need for income forced him out of school at the age of twelve. By that time, young Julius had become a voracious reader, particularly fond of [[Horatio Alger]]. Marx would continue to overcome his lack of formal education by becoming well-read.\n\nAfter a few stabs at entry-level office work and jobs suitable for adolescents, Julius took to the stage as a boy singer with the Gene Leroy Trio, debuting at the [[Ramona Park#Ramona Theater Pavilion|Ramona Theatre]] in [[Grand Rapids, MI]], on July 16, 1905.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bader|first=Robert S.|title=Four of the Three Musketeers: The Marx Brothers on Stage|date=2016|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston, IL|page=31|isbn=9780810134164}}</ref> Marx reputedly claimed that he was \"hopelessly average\" as a vaudevillian, but this was typical Marx, wisecracking in his true form. By 1909, Minnie Marx had assembled her sons into an undistinguished vaudeville singing group billed as \"The Four Nightingales\". The brothers Julius, Milton ([[Gummo Marx]]) and Arthur (originally Adolph, but Harpo Mark from 1911) and another boy singer, Lou Levy, traveled the U.S. vaudeville circuits to little fanfare. After exhausting their prospects in the East, the family moved to [[La Grange, Illinois]], to play the Midwest.\n \nAfter a particularly dispiriting performance in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]], Julius, Milton, and Arthur began cracking jokes onstage for their own amusement. Much to their surprise, the audience liked them better as comedians than as singers. They modified the then-popular [[Gus Edwards (songwriter)|Gus Edwards]] comedy skit \"School Days\" and renamed it \"Fun In Hi Skule\". The Marx Brothers would perform variations on this routine for the next seven years.\n\nFor a time in vaudeville, all the brothers performed using ethnic accents. Leonard, the oldest, developed the Italian accent he used as Chico Marx to convince some roving bullies that he was Italian, not Jewish. Arthur, the next oldest, donned a curly red wig and became \"Patsy Brannigan\", a stereotypical Irish character. His discomfort when speaking on stage led to his Uncle Al Shean's suggestion that he stop speaking altogether and play the role in mime. Julius Marx's character from \"Fun In Hi Skule\" was an ethnic German, so Julius played him with a German accent. After the sinking of the {{RMS|Lusitania}} in 1915, public [[anti-German sentiment]] was widespread, and Marx's German character was booed, so he quickly dropped the accent and developed the fast-talking wise-guy character that became his trademark.\n\nThe Marx Brothers became the biggest comedic stars of the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] in New York, which billed itself as the \"Valhalla of Vaudeville\". Brother Chico's deal-making skills resulted in three hit plays on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. No other comedy routine had ever so infected the Broadway circuit. All of this stage work predated their Hollywood career. By the time the Marxes made their first movie, they were already major stars with sharply honed skills; and by the time Groucho was relaunched to stardom on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', he had been performing successfully for half a century.\n\n== Career ==\n=== Hollywood ===\n[[File:Marx Brothers 1931.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|The Marx Brothers in 1931 (from top, Chico, Harpo, Groucho, and Zeppo)]]\nGroucho Marx made 26 movies, 13 of them with his brothers Chico and Harpo.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.groucho-marx.com/bio.html|title=Groucho Marx Biography|accessdate=2008-06-25|website=Groucho-marx.com|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66y4NMFqz?url=http://www.internetserviceteam.com/|archive-date=2012-04-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref> Marx developed a routine as a wisecracking hustler with a distinctive chicken-walking lope, an exaggerated greasepaint mustache and eyebrows, and an ever-present cigar, improvising insults to stuffy [[dowager]]s (often played by [[Margaret Dumont]]) and anyone else who stood in his way. As the Marx Brothers, he and his brothers starred in a series of popular stage shows and movies.\n\nTheir first movie was a silent film made in 1921 that was never released,<ref name=\"bio\"/> and is believed to have been destroyed at the time. A decade later, the team made two of their Broadway hits\u2014''[[The Cocoanuts]]'' and ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]''<ref name=\"bio\"/>\u2014into movies.

One of his earliest stints was a short-lived series in 1932, ''[[Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel]],'' costarring Chico. Though most of the scripts and discs were thought to have been destroyed, all but one of the scripts were found in 1988 in the [[Library of Congress]].\nIn 1947, Marx was asked to host a radio quiz program ''[[You Bet Your Life]].'' It was broadcast by ABC and then CBS before moving to NBC. It moved from radio to television on October 5, 1950, and ran for eleven years. Filmed before an audience, the show consisted of Marx bantering with the contestants and ad-libbing jokes before briefly quizzing them. The show was responsible for popularizing the phrases \"Say the secret word and the duck will come down and give you fifty dollars,\" \"Who's buried in [[Grant's Tomb]]?\" and \"What color is the [[White House]]?\" (asked to reward a losing contestant a consolation prize).\n\nThroughout his career, Marx introduced a number of memorable songs in films, including \"[[Captain Spaulding (Groucho Marx)|Hooray for Captain Spaulding]]\" and \"[[Hello, I Must Be Going (song)|Hello, I Must Be Going]]\", in ''Animal Crackers'', \"[[Horse Feathers#Musical numbers|Whatever It Is, I'm Against It]]\", \"[[Horse Feathers#Musical numbers|Everyone Says I Love You]]\" and \"[[Lydia the Tattooed Lady]]\". [[Frank Sinatra]], who once quipped that the only thing he could do better than Marx was sing, made a film with Marx and [[Jane Russell]] in 1951 entitled ''[[Double Dynamite]]''.\n\n=== Mustache, eyebrows, and walk ===\n{{See also|Groucho glasses}}\nIn public and off-camera, Harpo and Chico were hard to recognize, without their wigs and costumes, and it was almost impossible for fans to recognize Groucho without his trademark eyeglasses, fake eyebrows, and mustache.\n\n[[File:Groucho Marx-Eve Arden in At the Circus trailer.jpg|left|thumb|Groucho and [[Eve Arden]] in a scene from ''At the Circus'' (1939)]]\nThe greasepaint mustache and eyebrows originated spontaneously prior to a vaudeville performance in the early 1920s when he did not have time to apply the pasted-on mustache he had been using (or, according to his autobiography, simply did not enjoy the removal of the mustache because of the effects of tearing an adhesive bandage off the same patch of skin every night). After applying the greasepaint mustache, a quick glance in the mirror revealed his natural hair eyebrows were too undertoned and did not match the rest of his face, so Marx added the greasepaint to his eyebrows and headed for the stage. The absurdity of the greasepaint was never discussed on-screen, but in a famous scene in ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]],'' where both Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) disguise themselves as Groucho, they are briefly seen applying the greasepaint, implicitly answering any question a viewer might have had about where he got his mustache and eyebrows.\n\nMarx was asked to apply the greasepaint mustache once more for ''You Bet Your Life'' when it came to television, but he refused, opting instead to grow a real one, which he wore for the rest of his life. By this time, his eyesight had weakened enough for him actually to need corrective lenses; before then, his eyeglasses had merely been a stage prop. He debuted this new, and now much-older, appearance in ''[[Love Happy]],'' the Marx Brothers's last film as a comedy team.\n\nHe did paint the old character mustache over his real one on a few rare performing occasions, including a TV sketch with [[Jackie Gleason]] on the latter's variety show in the 1960s (in which they performed a variation on the song \"[[Mister Gallagher and Mister Shean]],\" co-written by Marx's uncle [[Al Shean]]) and the 1968 [[Otto Preminger]] film ''[[Skidoo (film)|Skidoo]]''. In his late 70s at the time, Marx remarked on his appearance: \"I looked like I was embalmed.\" He played a mob boss called \"God\" and, according to Marx, \"both my performance and the film were God-awful!\"\n\nThe exaggerated walk, with one hand on the small of his back and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, allowing the left hand to swing free with the gait. (Edmund Morris, in his biography ''[[The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt]]'', describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber for the first time in this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Edmund|title=The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt|date=2001|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=0-375-75678-7|pages=143\u2013144|edition=Modern Library Paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-R37GQsVfgC|accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref> Groucho exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedy effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Marx Brothers 1948.jpg|left|thumb|The Marx Brothers (clockwise from bottom: Groucho, Chico, and Harpo) by [[Yusuf Karsh]], 1946]]\nGroucho's three marriages ended in divorce.

When the group began its first rehearsal at Hecht's home, Groucho rushed in and demanded silence from the \"lousy amateurs\". The musicians discovered him conducting the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra in a performance of the overture to ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'' in Hecht's living room.

Wallaby, 1977.</ref> However, just as some of the other Democrats of the time, Marx also said in a television interview that he disliked the [[women's liberation movement]].

Annoyed that he was made to wait in the [[green room]] for 40 minutes, Groucho went on the air in a foul mood.\n\nHope started by saying \"Why, Groucho Marx! Groucho, what are you doing out here in the desert?\" Groucho retorted, \"Huh, desert, I've been sitting in the dressing room for forty minutes! Some desert alright...\" Groucho continued to ignore the script, ad-libbing at length to take the scene well beyond its allotted time slot.\n\nListening in on the show was producer [[John Guedel]], who had a brainstorm. He approached Groucho about doing a quiz show, to which Groucho derisively retorted, \"A quiz show? Only actors who are completely washed up resort to a quiz show!\" Undeterred, Guedel proposed that the quiz would be only a backdrop for Groucho's interviews of people, and the storm of ad-libbing that they would elicit. Groucho replied, \"Well, I've had no success in radio, and I can't hold on to a sponsor. At this point, I'll try anything!\"\n\n''You Bet Your Life'' debuted in October 1947 on ABC radio (which aired it from 1947 to 1949), sponsored by costume jewelry manufacturer [[Allen Gellman]];<ref>Charlotte Chandler. Hello, I must be going: Groucho and his friends. Doubleday, 1978, p 190</ref> and then on CBS (1949\u201350), and finally NBC. The show was on radio only from 1947 to 1950; on both radio and television from 1950 to 1960; and on television only, from 1960 to 1961. The show proved a huge hit, being one of the most popular on television by the mid-1950s. With [[George Fenneman]] as his announcer and straight man, Groucho entertained his audiences with improvised conversation with his guests. Since ''You Bet Your Life'' was mostly ad-libbed and unscripted\u2014although writers did pre-interview the guests and feed Groucho ready-made lines in advance\u2014the producers insisted that the network prerecord it instead of it being broadcast live. There were two reasons for this: prerecording provided Groucho with time to fish around for funny exchanges and any intervening dead spots to be edited out; and secondly to protect the network, since Groucho was a notorious loose cannon and known to say almost anything. The television show ran for 11 seasons until it was canceled in 1961. Automobile ''marque'' [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] was a longtime major sponsor. For the DeSoto ads, Marx would sometimes say: \"Tell 'em Groucho sent you\", or \"Try a DeSoto before you decide\".\n\nThe program's theme music was an instrumental version of \"[[Hooray for Captain Spaulding]]\", which became increasingly identified as Groucho's personal theme song. A recording of the song with Groucho and the Ken Lane singers with an orchestra directed by [[Victor Young]] was released in 1952. Another recording made by Groucho during this period was \"The Funniest Song in the World\", released on the Young People's Records label in 1949. It was a series of five original children's songs with a connecting narrative about a monkey and his fellow zoo creatures.\n\nAn apocryphal story relates Groucho interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx asked why she had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story is said to have replied, \"I love my husband\"; to which Marx responded, \"I love my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth once in a while.\" The remark was judged too risqu\u00e9 to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast.<ref>Dwan, R.

A clip of this is in rotation on [[Classic Arts Showcase]].\n\nAnother TV show, ''Tell It To Groucho'', premiered January 11, 1962, on CBS, but only lasted five months. On October 1, 1962, Groucho, after acting as occasional guest host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' during the six-month interval between [[Jack Paar]] and [[Johnny Carson]], introduced Carson as the new host.\n\nIn 1964, Marx starred in the \"Time for Elizabeth\" episode of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'', a truncated version of a play that Groucho Marx and [[Norman Krasna]] wrote in 1948.\n\nIn 1965,  Groucho starred in a weekly show for British TV titled ''Groucho'', broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The program was along similar lines to ''You Bet Your Life'', with [[Keith Fordyce]] taking on the Fenneman role. However, it was poorly received and lasted only 11 weeks.\n\nGroucho appeared as a gangster named God in the movie ''[[Skidoo (film)|Skidoo]]'' (1968), directed by [[Otto Preminger]], and costarring [[Jackie Gleason]] and [[Carol Channing]]. It was released by the studio where the Marx Brothers began their film career, [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film received almost universally negative reviews. As a side note, writer [[Paul Krassner]] published a story in the February 1981 issue of ''[[High Times Magazine|High Times]]'', relating how Groucho prepared for the LSD-themed movie by taking a dose of the drug in Krassner's company, and had a moving, largely pleasant experience.\n\nGroucho developed friendships with rock star [[Alice Cooper]]\u2014the two were photographed together for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine\u2014and television host [[Dick Cavett]], becoming a frequent guest on Cavett's late-night talk show, even appearing in a one-man, 90-minute interview.<ref name=\"Cavett19690613\">{{cite web|url=http://dickcavettshow.com/index.php/component/zoo/item/6-13-69|title=The Dick Cavett Show - 6/13/1969|website=Dickcavettshow.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref> He befriended [[Elton John]] when the British singer was staying in California in 1972, insisting on calling him \"John Elton.\" According to writer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], when Groucho jokingly pointed his index fingers as if holding a pair of six-shooters, Elton John put up his hands and said, \"Don't shoot me, I'm only the piano player,\" thereby naming [[Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player|the album he had just completed]].

Nintendo's competitors in the handheld market at the time were the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]], [[WonderSwan]], [[GP32]], [[Tapwave Zodiac]], and the [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]]. Despite the competitors' best efforts, Nintendo maintained a majority market share with the Game Boy Advance.\n\nAs of June 30, 2010, the Game Boy Advance series has sold 81.51 million units worldwide.<ref name=\"nintendosales\" /> Its successor, the [[Nintendo DS]], was released in November 2004 and is also compatible with Game Boy Advance software.\n\n==History==\nContrary to the previous Game Boy models, which were all following the \"portrait\" form factor of the original Game Boy (designed by [[Gunpei Yokoi]]), the Game Boy Advance was designed in a \"landscape\" form factor, putting the buttons to the sides of the device instead of below the screen. The Game Boy Advance was designed by the French designer Gw\u00e9na\u00ebl Nicolas and his Tokyo-based design studio Curiosity Inc.<ref>[http://curiosity.jp/works/en/product/gameboy-advance.html Gameboy Advance | WORKS - CURIOSITY - \u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30aa\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3 - ].

Game Boy games can be played using the same [[Game Boy Color#Color palettes used for original Game Boy games|selectable color palettes]] as on the Game Boy Color.\nEvery Nintendo handheld system following the release of the Game Boy Advance SP has included a built-in light and rechargeable battery.\n\nThe Game Boy Advance and [[Nintendo DS]] 2D graphics hardware have scaling and rotation for traditional tiled backgrounds in its modes 1 and 2 and scaling and rotation for bitmaps in modes 3 through 5 (used less often on the GBA because of technical limitations).<ref name=\"gbatek\">{{cite web | last=Korth | first=Martin | url=http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621131721/http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm | archivedate=June 21, 2009 |title=GBATEK: LCD I/O Display Control | accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> On each machine supporting this effect, it is possible to change the scaling and rotation values during the horizontal blanking period of each scanline{{clarify|reason=Aren't horizontal blanking periods and scanlines features of CRT displays, not LCDs?|date=November 2015}} to draw a flat plane in a perspective projection.

The Game Boy Advance has platformers, SNES-style [[role-playing video game]]s, and classic games ported from various 8-bit and 16-bit systems of the previous generations.  This includes the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, as well as the system's backward compatibility with all earlier Game Boy titles. All titles were GBA-exclusive and none of these were backwards compatible with older Game Boy systems. It featured a warning message that was refuse to play on classic Game Boy.\n\n''[[Final Fantasy VI Advance]]'' was the final licensed Japanese GBA game release.  Released November 2006, it was the final Nintendo-published game for the system.<ref>{{cite web|author=Search: |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/gba/930370-final-fantasy-vi-advance/data |title=Final Fantasy VI Advance Release Information for Game Boy Advance |publisher=GameFAQs |date= |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}</ref>  ''[[The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night]]'' was the final European GBA game, released November 2007.<ref>{{cite web|author=Search: |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/gba/941697-the-legend-of-spyro-the-eternal-night/data |title=The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night Release Information for Game Boy Advance |publisher=GameFAQs |date= |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Samurai Deeper Kyo]]'' was the final North American GBA game, released in February 2008. The last Nintendo-developed game released for the system was the Japan-only rhythm game ''[[Rhythm Tengoku]]'', which later went on to form the popular ''Rhythm Heaven'' series.\n\n===Compatibility with other systems===\nAn accessory for the [[GameCube]], known as the [[Game Boy Player]], was released in 2003 as the successor to the [[Super Game Boy]] peripheral for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The accessory allows Game Boy Advance games, as well as Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, to be played on the GameCube. However, some games may have compatibility issues due to certain features (for example, games with built-in motion sensors would require players to manipulate the console itself).\n\nGame Boy Advance games are compatible with the [[Nintendo DS]] and Nintendo DS Lite handheld consoles, which feature a cartridge slot at the bottom. They are not, however, compatible with the [[Nintendo DSi]], as it does not feature a cartridge slot.\n\n===Virtual Console===\n{{see also|Virtual Console}}\nAs part of an Ambassador Program for early adopters of the [[Nintendo 3DS]] system, ten Game Boy Advance games were made available free for players who bought a system before August 2011.<ref name=\"Pricedrop\">{{cite web |url=http://press.nintendo.com/articles.jsp?id=30048 |title=NINTENDO 3DS PRICE DROPS TO $169.99, AS GREAT VALUE AND NEW 3D GAMES COME TOGETHER |date=July 28, 2011 |publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of America's press release]] |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |quote=By the end of 2011, Nintendo will provide Ambassadors with 10 Game Boy Advance Virtual Console games.

All of the Virtual Console releases are single player only, as they do not emulate multiplayer features enabled by [[Game Link]] cables.\n\n==Accessories==\n===Official===\n[[File:Game-Boy-Advance-Wireless-Adapter.jpg|thumb|right|The Wireless Adapter was packed in with ''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']]\nNintendo released many addons for the Game Boy Advance. These include:\n* '''[[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter|Wireless Adapter]]''': Released in 2004, this adapter hooks up to the back of the Game Boy Advance. It replaces link cables and allows many people to link together. It marketed for [[United States dollar|US$]]20 and came included with [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']]. Because it was released so late in the Game Boy Advance's life, fewer than 20 games support this hardware. The adapter's usefulness is most evident in Pok\u00e9mon, as ''FireRed''/''LeafGreen'' and ''Emerald'' feature a \"Union Room\" where up to forty people can enter to battle or trade Pok\u00e9mon. A [[Game Boy Micro]] version was released interacting fully with both models of the Wireless Adapter.\n* '''Game Boy Advance Infra-Red Adapter''': This adapter was included with the game ''Cyberdrive Zoids'', as it is only compatible with this game and the latest GBA [[Pok\u00e9mon]] games. The adapter was not sold separately. This is also currently the only Game Boy Advance accessory that has not been remade for the Game Boy Micro.\n* '''[[Nintendo GameCube \u2013 Game Boy Advance link cable]]''': The link cable is used to connect the Game Boy Advance to the GameCube gaming console. It is intended for interoperability between games for the Game Boy and corresponding games for the GameCube. There were not many games that supported the hardware; notable titles are ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures]]'', allowing up to 4 players to use their Advance or SP handheld as a controller that has additional information on the screen, as well as ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'', allowing additional content to be unlocked through Tingle, one of the characters in the game. When using the cable in the game \"Animal Crossing\", players would be greeted by the in game character Kapp'n at the dock who would transport them to a previously inaccessible island. The device works for ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon XD]]'' which lets you trade Pok\u00e9mon back and forth to its GBA iterations (''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed'', ''LeafGreen'', ''Ruby'', ''Sapphire'', and ''Emerald''). In addition, it can be used to transfer [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]] between ''[[Sonic Adventure 2|Sonic Adventure 2: Battle]]'', ''[[Sonic Adventure DX Director's Cut]]'' and ''[[Sonic Advance]]'', ''[[Sonic Advance 2]]''. Finally, it can be used to unlock the \"Fusion\" skin for Samus (that was introduced in ''[[Metroid Fusion]]'') for use in ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', provided that the player has also met certain conditions in both Fusion and Prime.\n* '''[[Play-Yan]]''': The Play-Yan is an MP3/MPEG4 player for the Game Boy Advance and [[Nintendo DS]]. The cartridge is slightly broader than a normal Game Boy Advance cartridge and includes a built-in headphone port as well as an [[SD Card]] slot. Music or videos that users have downloaded from the Internet can be transferred onto an SD Card and slotted into the Play-Yan device. Nintendo has released several mini games for the Play-Yan that can be downloaded from their website, although Nintendo later removed all minigame functionality through a firmware update. The Play-Yan was initially available in Japan only, but was released in Europe as the Nintendo MP3 Player on December 8, 2006, with the MPEG4 functionality removed. The Play-Yan was never released in North America.\n* '''[[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]]''': The e-Reader is a scanning device that plugs into the game cartridge slot of the Game Boy Advance. Specialized cards with codes along the side and bottom are slid through the slot, scanning the card into the Game Boy Advance. Many ideas for the e-Reader include cards that scan classic games like ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and ''[[Excitebike]]'' onto the handheld ready to play, as well as a collaboration with ''[[Super Mario Advance 4]]'' and [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] to have cards that unlock content. [[GameCube]] games like ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' have cards with unlockable content as well, and the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'' playing cards also adopt the e-Reader codes. The e-Reader works with the [[Game Boy Player]] and Game Boy Advance SP, but cannot fit into the Nintendo DS's Game Boy slot (however it can fit into the [[Nintendo DS Lite]]'s Game Boy slot). Though it failed to catch on in the US, it proved to be very popular in Japan. It was not released in Europe.\n* '''[[Game Boy Advance Video]]''': These cartridges contain two episodes of thirty-minute cartoon programs. First released in North America in May 2004, these cartridges included cartoons such as ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'', ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[Sonic X]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]''. The movies ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Shrek 2]]'', and ''[[Shark Tale]]'' are also available for Game Boy Advance Video and all three movies are full. Due to the Game Boy Advance screen ratio, the three movies are in their widescreen format. These cartridges display an error when inserted into a GameCube via a Game Boy Player.

It can also be used to clean Slot 2 of the Nintendo DS or DS Lite.\n* '''Mobile Adapter''': The device works with Game Boy and Game Boy Advance systems to connect to mobile phones for remote play.

Optionally, a [[potentiometer]] or an [[integrated circuit]] could be added to allow adjusting the brightness of the light. When the initial version of the Game Boy Advance SP was released, it included a very similar integrated lighting system.  This was replaced in the subsequent version of the Game Boy Advance SP with a [[backlight|backlit]] display. According to Triton Labs, the Afterburner achieved considerable success during the lifespan of the GBA, with many gamers buying it despite the kit technically voiding the system\u2019s warranty, and the company had minor trouble keeping up with demand for the accessory during the 2002 holiday season.<ref name=\"GBA 2.0\"/>\n* '''Halo Light''': The Halo light was an external [[frontlight|front-lighting]] system that replaced the screen protector/lens of the GBA. The Halo had an external power adapter that connected to the link port, it featured on/off functions with a dimmer and a pass-through connector so other devices could be connected to the link port.\n* '''Worm Light''': The Worm Light was an adjustable and flexible light that connected to the link port. It had a small bulb which shone over the screen.\n* '''[[GBA Movie Player]]''': The GBA Movie Player is a versatile gaming cartridge that allows users to play [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES/Famicom]] games, watch movies, read [[.txt]] files, listen to sound clips, etc. The GBA Movie Player does not actually play MPEGS or MP3s directly, a freeware conversion software is needed, that converts an array of formats into GBM and GBS formats that are compatible with the GBA Movie Player. There are two forms of the GBA Movie Player with one using a CF (Compact Flash) card and one using an SD (Secure Digital) card, though different companies have made their own devices similar to the GBA Movie Player.\n* '''GBA TV Tuner''': It makes the portable system into a portable television. There are several versions available, which are made by different companies. The most popular TV Tuner requires a cartridge inserted in the Tuner to start up. The TV Tuners can store up to 99 channels.\n* '''[[GameShark]]''': The Game Boy Advance version of the GameShark, programmed only to work with Game Boy Advance games as making the device take Game Boy Color cartridges too would have made it expensive. This cheat device allowed users to change the code in their games to create cheats. Codes could be entered by hand or uploaded to the device itself with the provided USB cable and software.\n* '''[[Action Replay]]''': A cheating device like the GameShark, the Action Replay was sold mainly in Europe. It has a few extra features as well as an updated interface.\n* '''Action Replay MAX Duo''': This was an update to the Action Replay for Game Boy Advance. Not only did it function as an Action Replay, but for DS users, it could hold premade game saves or \"powersaves\" that could be downloaded from the Action Replay site as well as user made saves. It did not, however, function as a cheat device for [[Nintendo DS]] games; it was only for data backup.\n* '''Worm Cam''': This device by [[Nyko]] attached to the top of the Game Boy Advance and connected into the link port of the GBA. This device functioned as a digital camera which allowed digital pictures to be taken. The snapshots could then be uploaded to a PC with the USB cable and software provided. This camera's strange shape prevented it from being used with the GBA SP.\n* '''DigiCam SP''': This camera attachment was also made by Nyko and was essentially the Worm Cam for the Game Boy Advance SP. This add-on would slide on to the top half of the GBA SP (behind the screen) and a small plug would be connected into the link port.\n* '''DataBoy''': This cartridge plugs into the GBA game slot and converts the Game Boy into an RS-232 data scope (also known as serial line monitor or protocol analyzer). Users can play GB games, GBC games, and GBA games on it.\n* '''[[Game Boy Advance flash cartridge]]s''': These devices are commonly used for independently created games, or other third party development.\n* '''Glucoboy''': A blood glucose monitor with built-in games released in Australia in 2007 for children with [[diabetes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Strangest Health Gadgets|url=https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow_viewer/0,3253,l%253D224759%2526a%253D224758%2526po%253D1,00.asp|work=PCMag.com|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}</ref>\n* There are also numerous AC adapters that allow the Game Boy Advance to be used without batteries.\n\n==Revisions==\n===Game Boy Advance SP===\n[[File:Game-Boy-Advance-SP-Mk2.png|150px|right|thumb|Game Boy Advance SP]]\n{{Main article|Game Boy Advance SP}}\n\nIn early 2003, Nintendo introduced a new form-factor for the handheld, known as the Game Boy Advance SP (model AGS-001).  The redesigned unit resembles a pocket-size [[laptop]] computer, including a folding case approximately one-half the size of the original unit.  It also supports a rechargeable [[lithium ion battery]], a significantly brighter [[LCD]] screen, and an internal front-light that can be toggled on and off. The redesign was intended to address some common complaints about the original Game Boy Advance, which had been criticized for being somewhat uncomfortable to use, especially due to an overly dark screen.{{citation needed |date=July 2014}}\n\nAround the same time as the release of the [[Game Boy Micro]], Nintendo released a new backlit version of the SP (model AGS-101) in North America (commonly referred to as the \"GBA SP+\", SPII, or SP2).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The switch that controls the light now toggles between \"normal\" (which itself is already brighter than the original [[Game Boy Advance SP]]'s screen), and \"bright\", an intense brightness level similar to an LCD television set.\n\n===Game Boy Micro===\n[[File:Game-Boy-Micro.png|150px|right|thumb|Game Boy Micro]]\n{{Main article|Game Boy Micro}}\n\nIn September 2005, Nintendo released a second redesign of the Game Boy Advance. This model, dubbed the Game Boy Micro, is similar in style to the original Game Boy Advance's horizontal orientation, but is much smaller and sleeker. The Game Boy Micro also allows the user to switch between several colored faceplates to allow customization, a feature which Nintendo advertised heavily around the Game Boy Micro's launch. Nintendo also hoped that this \"fashion\" feature would help target audiences outside of typical video game players. Unlike the previous Game Boy Advance models, Game Boy Micro is unable to support [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] titles. The Game Boy Micro did not make much of an impact in the video game market as it was overshadowed by Nintendo's other portable, the [[Nintendo DS]], which also played Game Boy Advance cartridges.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/kessan/060607qa_e/03.html |title=Nintendo Co., Ltd. - Corporate Management Policy Briefing \u2013 Q&A |accessdate=December 6, 2008 |page=3 |publisher=[[Nintendo]] Co., Ltd. |quote=The sales of Micro did not meet our expectations ...

Previous keyword-based methods of ranking search results, used by many search engines that were once more popular than Google, would rank pages by how often the search terms occurred in the page, or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page. The PageRank algorithm instead analyzes human-generated [[hyperlink|links]] assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are themselves likely to be important. The algorithm computes a [[recursion|recursive]] score for pages, based on the weighted sum of the PageRanks of the pages linking to them. PageRank is thought to [[correlation|correlate]] well with human concepts of importance.

An industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on Google and on other search engines. This field, called [[search engine optimization]], attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings, and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their clients' sites. Search engine optimization encompasses both \"on page\" factors (like body copy, title elements, H1 heading elements and image [[alt attribute]] values) and Off Page Optimization factors (like [[anchor text]] and PageRank). The general idea is to affect Google's relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places \"on page\", in particular the title element and the body copy (note: the higher up in the page, presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking). Too many occurrences of the keyword, however, cause the page to look suspect to Google's spam checking algorithms. Google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.google.com/webmasters/guidelines.html |title = Google Webmaster Guidelines |publisher = Google |accessdate = November 15, 2009 }}</ref> It has been hypothesized, and, allegedly, is the opinion of the owner of one business about which there have been numerous complaints, that negative publicity, for example, numerous consumer complaints, may serve as well to elevate page rank on Google Search as favorable comments.<ref>{{cite news |title = A Bully Finds a Pulpit on the Web |first = David |last = Segal |newspaper = The New York Times |date = November 26, 2010 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html |accessdate = November 27, 2010 }}</ref> The particular problem addressed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' article, which involved [[DecorMyEyes]], was addressed shortly thereafter by an undisclosed fix in the Google algorithm.

Among other things, we apply a narrow set of removal policies for pornography, violence, and hate speech. It's important to note that removing queries from Autocomplete is a hard problem, and not as simple as blacklisting particular terms and phrases.\n\nIn search, we get more than one billion searches each day. Because of this, we take an algorithmic approach to removals, and just like our search algorithms, these are imperfect. We will continue to work to improve our approach to removals in Autocomplete, and are listening carefully to feedback from our users.\n\nOur algorithms look not only at specific words, but compound queries based on those words, and across all languages. So, for example, if there's a bad word in Russian, we may remove a compound word including the transliteration of the Russian word into English. We also look at the search results themselves for given queries. So, for example, if the results for a particular query seem pornographic, our algorithms may remove that query from Autocomplete, even if the query itself wouldn't otherwise violate our policies.

They had advocated the analysis of reaction time and sensory acuity as measures of \"neurophysiological efficiency\" and the analysis of sensory acuity as a measure of [[intelligence]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Fancher |first=Raymond E |title=Alfred Binet, General Psychologist |pages=67\u201384 |series=Portraits of Pioneers in Psychology |volume=III |editor-first=Gregory A |editor-last=Kimble |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Wertheimer |location=Hillsdale, NJ |year=1998 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=978-1-55798-479-1 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nGalton is regarded as the founder of [[psychometrics|psychometry]]. He studied the work of his older half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]] about biological evolution. Hypothesizing that eminence is inherited from ancestors, Galton did a study of families of eminent people in Britain, publishing it in 1869 as ''Hereditary Genius''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hereditary Genius |last=Galton |first=Francis |date=1869 |publisher=MacMillan |location=London |url=http://galton.org/books/hereditary-genius/ |accessdate=4 April 2014 |laysummary=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Galton/wozniak.htm |laydate=4 April 2014 |ref=harv}}</ref> Galton's ideas were elaborated from the work of two early 19th-century pioneers in [[statistics]]: [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Adolphe Quetelet]]. Gauss discovered the [[normal distribution]] (bell-shaped curve): given a large number of measurements of the same variable under the same conditions, they vary at [[Randomness|random]] from a most frequent value, the \"average\", to two least frequent values at maximum differences greater and lower than the most frequent value. Quetelet discovered that the bell-shaped curve applied to social statistics gathered by the French government in the course of its normal processes on large numbers of people passing through the courts and the military. His initial work in criminology led him to observe \"the greater the number of individuals observed the more do peculiarities become effaced...\". This ideal from which the peculiarities were effaced became \"the average man\".<ref>{{cite book |page=160 |title=Against the gods |first=Peter L. |last=Bernstein |publisher=Wiley |year=1998 |isbn=0-471-12104-5}}</ref>\n\nGalton was inspired by Quetelet to define the average man as \"an entire normal scheme\"; that is, if one combines the normal curves of every measurable human characteristic, one will, in theory, perceive a syndrome straddled by \"the average man\" and flanked by persons that are different. In contrast to Quetelet, Galton's average man was not statistical but was theoretical only. There was no measure of general averageness, only a large number of very specific averages. Setting out to discover a general measure of the average, Galton looked at educational statistics and found bell-curves in test results of all sorts; initially in mathematics grades for the final honors examination and in entrance examination scores for [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]].\n\nGalton's method in ''Hereditary Genius'' was to count and assess the eminent relatives of eminent men. He found that the number of eminent relatives was greater with a closer degree of kinship. This work is considered the first example of [[historiometry]], an analytical study of historical human progress. The work is controversial and has been criticized for several reasons. Galton then departed from Gauss in a way that became crucial to the history of the 20th century AD. The bell-shaped curve was not random, he concluded. The differences between the average and the upper end were due to a non-random factor, \"natural ability\", which he defined as \"those qualities of intellect and disposition, which urge and qualify men to perform acts that lead to reputation\u2026a nature which, when left to itself, will, urged by an inherent stimulus, climb the path that leads to eminence.\"<ref>Bernstein (1998), page 163.</ref> The apparent randomness of the scores was due to the randomness of this natural ability in the population as a whole, in theory.\n\nCriticisms include that Galton's study fails to account for the impact of social status and the associated availability of resources in the form of economic inheritance, meaning that inherited \"eminence\" or \"genius\" can be gained through the enriched environment provided by wealthy families. Galton went on to develop the field of [[eugenics]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gillham |first1=Nicholas W. |title=Sir Francis Galton and the birth of eugenics |journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=83\u2013101 |date=2001 |pmid=11700278 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.35.102401.090055}}</ref>\n\n==Psychology==\nGenius is expressed in a variety of forms (e.g., mathematical, literary, musical performance).

But somehow he trusted his own experiencing of life, the process of himself, sufficiently that he could go on expressing his own unique perceptions. It was as though he could say, 'Good artists don't paint like this, but ''I'' paint like this.' Or to move to another field, Ernest Hemingway was surely aware that 'good writers do not write like this.'

In his book ''Hereditary Genius'', written before the development of IQ testing, he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong, and that eminence is rare in the general population. Lewis Terman chose \"'near' genius or genius\" as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford-Binet test.<ref name=\"Terman1916p79\" /> By 1926, Terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of California schoolchildren who were referred for IQ testing by their schoolteachers, called [[Genetic Studies of Genius]], which he conducted for the rest of his life. Catherine M. Cox, a colleague of Terman's, wrote a whole book, ''[[List of 301 geniuses by IQ (Catharine Cox Miles)|The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses]]'',<ref name=\"Cox 1926\"/> published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series, in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses. Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds,<ref name=\"PintneronCox\" /><ref name=\"Shurkin1992pp70\u201371\" /><ref name=\"EysenckonCox\" /> Cox's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius.<ref name=\"Cox1926pp215\u2013219\" /> By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford-Binet test, Terman no longer used the term \"genius\" as an IQ classification, nor has any subsequent IQ test.<ref name=\"TermanMerrill1960p18\" /><ref name=\"Kaufman2009p117\" /> In 1939, [[David Wechsler]] specifically commented that \"we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score\".<ref name=\"Wechsler1939p45\" />\n\nThe Terman longitudinal study in California eventually provided historical evidence regarding how genius is related to IQ scores.<ref name=\"Eysenck1998pp127\u2013128\" /> Many California pupils were recommended for the study by schoolteachers. Two pupils who were tested but rejected for inclusion in the study (because their IQ scores were too low) grew up to be Nobel Prize winners in physics, [[William Shockley]],<ref name=\"Simonton1999p4\" /><ref name=\"Shurkin2006p13\" /> and [[Luis Walter Alvarez]].<ref name=\"Leslie2000\" /><ref name=\"ParkLubinskiBenbow2010\" /> Based on the historical findings of the Terman study and on biographical examples such as [[Richard Feynman]], who had an IQ of 125 and went on to win the Nobel Prize in physics and become widely known as a genius,<ref name=\"Gleick2011p32\" /><ref name=\"Robinson2011p47\" /> the current view of psychologists and other scholars of genius is that a minimum level of IQ (approximately 125) is necessary for genius but not sufficient, and must be combined with personality characteristics such as drive and persistence, plus the necessary opportunities for talent development.<ref name=\"Jensen1998p577\" /><ref name=\"Eysenck1998p127a\" /><ref name=\"Pickover1998p224\"/>\n\nSome high IQ individuals join a [[High IQ society]]. The most famous is [[Mensa International]] but others exist including The International High IQ Society, the [[Prometheus Society]], the [[Triple Nine Society]], and Magnus.\n\n==Philosophy==\n[[Image:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] is widely acknowledged as having been a genius and a [[polymath]].]]\nVarious [[philosopher]]s have proposed definitions of what genius is and what that implies in the context of their philosophical theories.\n[[File:Croce-Mozart-Detail.jpg|165px|thumbnail|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], considered a [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] and [[music]]al genius]]\n\nIn the philosophy of [[David Hume]], the way society perceives genius is similar to the way society perceives the ignorant. Hume states that a person with the characteristics of a genius is looked at as a person disconnected from society, as well as a person who works remotely, at a distance, away from the rest of the world. <blockquote>On the other hand, the mere ignorant is still more despised; nor is any thing deemed a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish, than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments. The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes; retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company, and business; preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters; and in business, that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hume|first=David|title=An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. \u2014 \"Of the different Species of Philosophy\"|url=http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/|publisher=Bartleby.com|location=New York|date=2001|accessdate=2 September 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANiOVq0G?url=http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/1.html|archivedate=2 September 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have to be taught by another person. For Kant, originality was the essential character of genius.<ref>Howard Caygill, Kant Dictionary ({{ISBN|0-631-17535-0}}).</ref> This genius is a talent for producing ideas which can be described as non-imitative. Kant's discussion of the characteristics of genius is largely contained within the ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' and was well received by the [[romanticism|Romantics]] of the early 19th century. In addition, much of Schopenhauer's theory of genius, particularly regarding talent and freedom from constraint, is directly derived from paragraphs of Part I of Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kant |first1=Immanuel |title=Kritik der Urteilskraft |trans-title=The Critique of Judgment |year=1790 |at=\u00a746\u2013\u00a749}} E.g. \u00a746: \"Genius is a talent for producing something for which no determinate rule can be given, not a predisposition consisting of a skill for something that can be learned by following some rule or other.\" (trans. W.S. Pluhar).</ref>\n\n{{quote|Genius is a talent for producing something for which no determinate rule can be given, not a predisposition consisting of a skill for something that can be learned by following some rule or other.|author=[[Immanuel Kant]]}}\n\nIn the philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], a genius is someone in whom intellect predominates over \"[[will (philosophy)|will]]\" much more than within the average person. In [[Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics|Schopenhauer's aesthetics]], this predominance of the intellect over the will allows the genius to create artistic or academic works that are objects of pure, disinterested contemplation, the chief criterion of the aesthetic experience for Schopenhauer. Their remoteness from mundane concerns means that Schopenhauer's geniuses often display [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]] traits in more mundane concerns; in Schopenhauer's words, they fall into the mire while gazing at the stars, an allusion to Plato's dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|The\u00e6tetus]]'', in which Socrates tells of [[Thales]] (the first philosopher) being ridiculed for falling in such circumstances. As he says in Volume 2 of ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'':\n\n{{quote|Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see.|author=[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]<ref>Quoted in {{cite book|last=Allan|first=George|title=Modes of Learning: Whitehead's Metaphysics and the Stages of Education|year=2012|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=978-1-4384-4187-0|page=98|chapter=Learning to Reason}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the philosophy of [[Bertrand Russell]], genius entails that an individual possesses [[Quality (philosophy)|unique qualities]] and [[Aptitude|talents]] that make the genius especially valuable to the society in which he or she operates, once given the chance to contribute to society. Russell's philosophy further maintains, however, that it is possible for such geniuses to be crushed in their youth and lost forever when the environment around them is unsympathetic to their potential maladaptive traits. Russell rejected the notion he believed was popular during his lifetime that, \"genius will out\".<ref>Page 91, ''The Conquest of Happiness'', {{ISBN|0-415-37847-8}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n<!--Since Wikipedia lacks a list of geniuses, the following list is provided to help users find articles on very smart people.-->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Intelligence]]\n* [[Aptitude]]\n* [[Creativity]]\n* ''[[Genetic Studies of Genius]]''\n* [[Intellectual giftedness]]\n** [[Child prodigy]]\n*** [[List of child prodigies]]\n**** [[List of child music prodigies]]\n** [[Gifted education]]\n** [[List of chess prodigies]]\n** [[Savant syndrome]]\n* [[List of 301 geniuses by IQ (Catharine Cox Miles)|List of 301 geniuses by IQ]]\n* [[Lists of artists]]\n* [[Lists of composers]]\n* [[Lists of engineers]]\n* [[List of explorers]]\n* [[List of inventors]]\n* [[Lists of mathematicians]]\n* [[Lists of philosophers]]\n* [[Lists of scientists]]\n* [[Lists of writers]]\n* [[MacArthur Fellows Program]]\n** [[MacArthur Fellows Program#Recipients|List of MacArthur Fellows]]\n* [[Nobel Prize]]\n** [[List of Nobel laureates]]\n* [[Polymath]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Terman1916p79\">{{Harvnb |Terman|1916|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=26l9AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA79 79]}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TermanMerrill1960p18\">{{Harvnb |Terman|Merrill|1960|page=18}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"PintneronCox\">{{Harvnb |Pintner|1931|pages=356\u2013357 \"From a study of these boyhood records, estimates of the probable I.Q.s of these men in childhood have been made\u2026.

While almost all of them belong to the same species, ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'', table and wine grapes have significant differences, brought about through [[selective breeding]]. Table grape cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit (see below) with relatively thin skin. Wine grapes are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). Wine grapes also tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24% sugar by weight. By comparison, commercially produced \"100% grape juice\", made from table grapes, is usually around 15% sugar by weight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wineloverspage.com/dibbern/grapetaste07.phtml|title=WineLoversPage \u2013 Straight talk in plain English about fine wine|website=WineLoversPage|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716153541/http://www.wineloverspage.com/dibbern/grapetaste07.phtml|archivedate=2011-07-16|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Seedless grapes ==\nSeedless cultivars now make up the overwhelming majority of table grape plantings. Because grapevines are [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively propagated]] by cuttings, the lack of seeds does not present a problem for reproduction. It is an issue for breeders, who must either use a seeded variety as the female parent or rescue embryos early in development using [[Plant tissue culture|tissue culture]] techniques.\n\nThere are several sources of the seedlessness trait, and essentially all commercial cultivators get it from one of three sources: [[Thompson Seedless]], [[Russian Seedless]], and [[Black Monukka]], all being cultivars of ''[[Vitis vinifera]]''. There are currently more than a dozen varieties of seedless grapes. Several, such as Einset Seedless, Benjamin Gunnels's Prime seedless grapes, Reliance, and Venus, have been specifically cultivated for hardiness and quality in the relatively cold climates of northeastern United States and southern [[Ontario]].<ref>Reisch BI, Peterson DV, Martens M-H.

In the UK, three different varieties are recognized, forcing the EU to use the term \"dried vine fruit\" in official documents.\n\nA ''[[raisin]]'' is any dried grape. While ''raisin'' is a French [[loanword]], the word in French refers to the fresh fruit; ''grappe'' (from which the English ''grape'' is derived) refers to the bunch (as in ''une grappe de raisins'').\n\nA ''[[Zante currant|currant]]'' is a dried [[Zakynthos|Zante]] [[Black Corinth]] grape, the name being a corruption of the French ''raisin de Corinthe'' ([[Corinth]] grape). ''Currant'' has also come to refer to the [[blackcurrant]] and [[redcurrant]], two berries unrelated to grapes.\n\nA ''sultana'' was originally a raisin made from [[sultana (grape)|Sultana]] grapes of Turkish origin (known as Thompson Seedless in the United States), but the word is now applied to raisins made from either white grapes or red grapes that are bleached to resemble the traditional sultana.\n\n== Juice ==\n[[File:Grape Juice.jpg|thumb|upright|Grape juice]]\nGrape juice is obtained from crushing and blending grapes into a liquid. The juice is often sold in stores or [[fermentation (wine)|fermented]] and made into [[wine]], [[brandy]], or [[vinegar]].  Grape juice that has been pasteurized, removing any naturally occurring yeast, will not ferment if kept sterile, and thus contains no alcohol.  In the [[wine]] industry, grape juice that contains 7\u201323% of pulp, skins, stems and seeds is often referred to as \"[[must]]\". In North America, the most common grape juice is purple and made from [[Concord (grape)|Concord grapes]], while white grape juice is commonly made from [[Niagara (grape)|Niagara grapes]], both of which are varieties of {{Not a typo|native American}} grapes, a different species from European wine grapes. In California, Sultana (known there as Thompson Seedless) grapes are sometimes diverted from the raisin or table market to produce white juice.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sweetwatercellars.com/thompsonseedless.html |title= Thompson Seedless Grape Juice |work= sweetwatercellars.com |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120325155101/http://sweetwatercellars.com/thompsonseedless.html |archivedate= 2012-03-25 |df=  }}</ref>\n\n== Health claims ==\n{{Main|Health effects of wine|Grape therapy|Grape and raisin toxicity in dogs}}\n\n=== French paradox ===\n{{Main|French paradox}}\nComparing diets among Western countries, researchers have discovered that although the French tend to eat higher levels of animal fat, the incidence of [[heart disease]] remains low in France.

Only a few disorders have this inheritance pattern, with a prime example being [[X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets]].  Males and females are both affected in these disorders, with males typically being more severely affected than females.  Some X-linked dominant conditions, such as [[Rett syndrome]], [[incontinentia pigmenti]] type 2, and [[Aicardi syndrome]], are usually fatal in males either ''in utero'' or shortly after birth, and are therefore predominantly seen in females.  Exceptions to this finding are extremely rare cases in which boys with [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (47,XXY) also inherit an X-linked dominant condition and exhibit symptoms more similar to those of a female in terms of disease severity.  The chance of passing on an X-linked dominant disorder differs between men and women.  The sons of a man with an X-linked dominant disorder will all be unaffected (since they receive their father's Y chromosome), and his daughters will all inherit the condition. A woman with an X-linked dominant disorder has a 50% chance of having an affected fetus with each pregnancy, although in cases such as incontinentia pigmenti, only female offspring are generally viable.  In addition, although these conditions do not alter fertility ''per se'', individuals with Rett syndrome or Aicardi syndrome rarely reproduce.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n=== X-linked recessive ===\n{{Main|X-linked recessive inheritance}}\nX-linked recessive conditions are also caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Males are more frequently affected than females, and the chance of passing on the disorder differs between men and women. The sons of a man with an X-linked recessive disorder will not be affected, and his daughters will carry one copy of the mutated gene.  A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder (X<sup>R</sup>X<sup>r</sup>) has a 50% chance of having sons who are affected and a 50% chance of having daughters who carry one copy of the mutated gene and are therefore carriers.  X-linked recessive conditions include the serious diseases [[hemophilia A]], [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], and [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]], as well as common and less serious conditions such as [[Androgenic alopecia|male pattern baldness]] and red-green [[color blindness]].  X-linked recessive conditions can sometimes manifest in females due to [[skewed X-inactivation]] or [[Turner syndrome|monosomy X (Turner syndrome)]].\n\n===Y-linked===\n{{Main|Y linkage}}\nY-linked disorders are caused by mutations on the Y chromosome.  These conditions may only be transmitted from the heterogametic sex (e.g. male humans) to offspring of the same sex. More simply, this means that Y-linked disorders in humans can only be passed from men to their sons; females can never be affected because they do not possess Y-allosomes.\n\nY-linked disorders are exceedingly rare but the most well-known examples typically cause infertility. Reproduction in such conditions is only possible through the circumvention of infertility by medical intervention.\n\n===Mitochondrial===\n{{Main|Mitochondrial disease}}\nThis type of inheritance, also known as maternal inheritance, applies to genes encoded by [[mitochondrial DNA]]. Because only egg cells contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only mothers can pass on mitochondrial DNA conditions to their children. An example of this type of disorder is [[Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy]]. It is important to stress that the vast majority of mitochondrial disease (particularly when symptoms develop in early life) is actually caused by an underlying nuclear gene defect, and most often follows autosomal recessive inheritance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Multiple genes{{anchor|Multifactorial_and_polygenic_.28complex.29_disorders}}==\n\nGenetic disorders may also be complex, multifactorial, or polygenic, meaning they are likely associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyles and environmental factors. Multifactorial disorders include [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Although complex disorders often cluster in families, they do not have a clear-cut pattern of inheritance. This makes it difficult to determine a person\u2019s risk of inheriting or passing on these disorders. Complex disorders are also difficult to study and treat, because the specific factors that cause most of these disorders have not yet been identified. Studies which aim to identify the cause of complex disorders can use several methodological approaches to determine [[genotype]]-[[phenotype]] associations. One method, the [[genotype-first approach]], starts by identifying genetic variants within patients and then determining the associated clinical manifestations. This is opposed to the more traditional phenotype-first approach, and may identify causal factors that have previously been obscured by clinical [[heterogeneity]], [[penetrance]], and expressivity.\n\nOn a pedigree, polygenic diseases do tend to \"run in families\", but the inheritance does not fit simple patterns as with [[Mendelian]] diseases.  But this does not mean that the genes cannot eventually be located and studied.  There is also a strong environmental component to many of them (e.g., [[blood pressure]]).\n\n* [[asthma]]\n* [[autoimmune disease]]s such as [[multiple sclerosis]]\n* [[cancer]]s\n* [[ciliopathy|ciliopathies]]\n* [[cleft palate]]\n* [[diabetes]]\n* [[heart disease]]\n* [[hypertension]]\n* [[inflammatory bowel disease]]\n* [[intellectual disability]]\n* [[mood disorder]]\n* [[obesity]]\n* [[refractive error]]\n* [[infertility]]\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n{{See also|Prenatal testing|Newborn screening}}\n\nDue to the wide range of genetic disorders that are known, diagnosis is widely varied and dependent of the disorder. Most genetic disorders are diagnosed at birth or during early childhood however some, such as [[Huntington's disease]], can escape detection until the patient is well into adulthood.\n\nThe basic aspects of a genetic disorder rests on the inheritance of genetic material. With an in depth [[Family history (medicine)|family history]], it is possible to anticipate possible disorders in children which direct medical professionals to specific tests depending on the disorder and allow parents the chance to prepare for potential lifestyle changes, anticipate the possibility of [[stillbirth]], or contemplate [[Termination of pregnancy|termination]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Milunsky|first1=edited by Aubrey|title=Genetic disorders and the fetus : diagnosis, prevention, and treatment|date=2004|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801879280|edition=5th}}</ref> [[Prenatal diagnosis]] can detect the presence of characteristic abnormalities in fetal development through [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]], or detect the presence of characteristic substances via [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive procedures]] which involve inserting probes or needles into the uterus such as in [[amniocentesis]].<ref name=\"harvard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/diagnostic-tests/amniosentesis.htm |title=Diagnostic Tests \u2013 Amniocentesis |publisher=Harvard Medical School |accessdate=2008-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516200040/http://www.health.harvard.edu/diagnostic-tests/amniosentesis.htm |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Prognosis ==\nNot all genetic disorders directly result in death; however, there are no known cures for genetic disorders. Many genetic disorders affect stages of development, such as [[Down syndrome]], while others result in purely physical symptoms such as [[muscular dystrophy]]. Other disorders, such as [[Huntington's disease]], show no signs until adulthood. During the active time of a genetic disorder, patients mostly rely on maintaining or slowing the degradation of [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] and maintain patient [[autonomy]]. This includes [[physical therapy]], [[pain management]], and may include a selection of [[alternative medicine]] programs.\n\n== Treatment ==\n[[File:Personal genomics gene therapy flowchart.png|thumb|right|150px|From [[personal genomics]] to gene therapy]]\n{{See also|Gene therapy}}\n\nThe treatment of genetic disorders is an ongoing battle with over 1800 gene therapy clinical trials having been completed, are ongoing, or have been approved worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ginn|first1=Samantha L.|last2=Alexander|first2=Ian E.|last3=Edelstein|first3=Michael L.|last4=Abedi|first4=Mohammad R.|last5=Wixon|first5=Jo|title=Gene therapy clinical trials worldwide to 2012 - an update|journal=The Journal of Gene Medicine|date=February 2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=65\u201377|doi=10.1002/jgm.2698}}</ref> Despite this, most treatment options revolve around treating the symptoms of the disorders in an attempt to improve patient [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]].\n\nGene therapy refers to a form of treatment where a healthy gene is introduced to a patient. This should alleviate the defect caused by a faulty gene or slow the progression of disease. A major obstacle has been the delivery of genes to the appropriate cell, tissue, and organ affected by the disorder.

In [[DNA]], guanine is paired with cytosine. The guanine [[nucleoside]] is called [[guanosine]].\n\nWith the formula C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O, guanine is a derivative of [[purine]], consisting of a fused [[pyrimidine]]-[[imidazole]] ring system with conjugated double bonds. Being unsaturated, the bicyclic molecule is planar.\n\n==Properties==\nGuanine, along with adenine and cytosine, is present in both DNA and RNA, whereas thymine is usually seen only in DNA, and uracil only in RNA. Guanine has two [[tautomer]]ic forms, [[keto-enol tautomerism|the major keto form (see figures) and rare enol form]].\n\nIt binds to cytosine through three [[hydrogen bond]]s. In cytosine, the amino group acts as the hydrogen bond donor and the C-2 carbonyl and the N-3 amine as the hydrogen-bond acceptors. Guanine has the C-6 carbonyl group that acts as the hydrogen bond acceptor, while a group at N-1 and the amino group at C-2 act as the hydrogen bond donors.\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n| width =\"325px\"| [[Image:Cytonum2.png|200px]]\n| width =\"325px\"| [[Image:Guannum2.png|250px]]\n|}\n\nGuanine can be [[hydrolyzed]] with strong acid to [[glycine]], [[ammonia]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[carbon monoxide]]. First, guanine gets [[Deamination|deaminated]] to become [[xanthine]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Angstadt | title=Purines and pyrimidines | url=http://library.med.utah.edu/NetBiochem/pupyr/pp.htm |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> Guanine oxidizes more readily than adenine, the other purine-derivative base in DNA. Its high melting point of 350&nbsp;\u00b0C reflects the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the oxo and amino groups in the molecules in the crystal. Because of this intermolecular bonding, guanine is relatively insoluble in water, but it is soluble in dilute acids and bases.\n\n==History==\nThe first isolation of guanine was reported in 1844 by the German chemist Julius Bodo Unger (1819\u20131885), who obtained it from the excreta of sea birds, which is known as [[guano]] and which was used as a source of fertilizer; guanine was named in 1846.<ref>Guanine was first isolated in 1844 by Julius Bodo Unger (1819\u20131885), a student of Prof. [[Heinrich Gustav Magnus]].

It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves.

The Soviet views were also shared by a number of other States for whom it is difficult to establish any geographic or social common denominator: Lebanon, Sweden, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, Iran, Egypt, Belgium, and Uruguay. The exclusion of political groups was in fact originally promoted by a non-governmental organization, the World Jewish Congress, and it corresponded to Raphael Lemkin's vision of the nature of the crime of genocide.\"<ref>William A.

Its objectives are to safeguard the very existence of certain human groups and to affirm and emphasize the most elementary principles of humanity and morality. In view of the rights involved, the legal obligations to refrain from genocide are recognized as ''[[erga omnes]]''.\n\nWhen the Convention was drafted, it was already envisaged that it would apply not only to then existing forms of genocide, but also \"to any method that might be evolved in the future with a view to destroying the physical existence of a group\".<ref>From a statement made by Mr. Morozov, representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, on 19 April 1948 during the debate in the Ad Hoc Committee on Genocide (E/AC.25/SR.12).</ref> As emphasized in the preamble to the Convention, genocide has marred all periods of history, and it is this very tragic recognition that gives the concept its historical evolutionary nature.\n\nThe Convention must be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, in their context, and in the light of its object and purpose. Moreover, the text of the Convention should be interpreted in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to every word. No word or provision may be disregarded or treated as superfluous, unless this is absolutely necessary to give effect to the terms read as a whole.<ref>See Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, opened for signature on 23 May 1969, United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 1155, No. I-18232.</ref>\n\nGenocide is a crime under international law regardless of \"whether committed in time of peace or in time of war\" (art.

For example, Frank Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn studied the whole of human history, while [[Leo Kuper]] and [[R. J. Rummel]] in their more recent works concentrated on the 20th century, and [[Helen Fein]], Barbara Harff and Ted Gurr have looked at post World War II events.

J. Rummel, genocide has 3 different meanings. The ordinary meaning is murder by government of people due to their national, ethnic, racial, or religious group membership. The legal meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty, the ''Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide'' (CPPCG). This also includes non-killings that in the end eliminate the group, such as preventing births or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group. A generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. It is to avoid confusion regarding what meaning is intended that Rummel created the term [[democide]] for the third meaning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/GENOCIDE.HTM|title=DEMOCIDE VERSUS GENOCIDE: WHICH IS WHAT?|website=www.hawaii.edu|accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nHighlighting the potential for state and non-state actors to commit genocide in the 21st century, for example, in failed states or as non-state actors acquire weapons of mass destruction, Adrian Gallagher defined genocide as 'When a source of collective power (usually a state) intentionally uses its power base to implement a process of destruction in order to destroy a group (as defined by the perpetrator), in whole or in substantial part, dependent upon relative group size'.<ref>Adrian Gallagher, Genocide and Its Threat to Contemporary International Order (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013) p. 37.</ref> The definition upholds the centrality of intent, the multidimensional understanding of destroy, broadens the definition of group identity beyond that of the 1948 definition yet argues that a substantial part of a group has to be destroyed before it can be classified as genocide.\n\n==International prosecution of genocide==\n\n===By ''ad hoc'' tribunals===\n[[File:Nuon Chea - 5 December 2011.jpg|thumb||upright=0.9|[[Nuon Chea]], the Khmer Rouge's chief ideologist, before the [[Cambodian Genocide Tribunal]] on 5 December 2011.]]\nAll signatories to the CPPCG are required to prevent and punish acts of genocide, both in peace and wartime, though some barriers make this enforcement difficult.

Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide.<ref>Staub, E (1989).
