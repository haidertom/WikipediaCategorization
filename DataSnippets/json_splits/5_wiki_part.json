Instead, he lived with Galena Lysistrata, one of Faustina's freed women. [[Concubinage]] was a form of female companionship sometimes chosen by powerful men in Ancient Rome, especially widowers like [[Vespasian]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]]. Their union could not produce any legitimate offspring who could threaten any heirs, such as those of Antoninus. Also, as one could not have a wife and an official concubine (or two concubines) at the same time, Antoninus avoided being pressed into a marriage with a noblewoman from another family (later, Marcus Aurelius would also reject the advances of his former fianc\u00e9e Ceionia Fabia, Lucius Verus's sister, on the grounds of protecting his children from a stepmother, and took a concubine instead).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Strong|first1=Anise K.|title=Prostitutes and Matrons in the Roman World|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107148758|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ClSJDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA85}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Lind|first1=Goran|title=Common Law Marriage: A Legal Institution for Cohabitation|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199710539|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-kJxOISFSMC&pg=PA72}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Birley|first1=Anthony R|title=Marcus Aurelius: A Biography|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134695690|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gl5T47CvuDsC&pg=PA33}}</ref>\n\n===Favor with Hadrian===\n\nHaving filled the offices of [[quaestor]] and [[praetor]] with more than usual success,<ref>Traver, Andrew G., ''From polis to empire, the ancient world, c. 800 B.C. \u2013 A.D. 500'', (2002) p. 33; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 2:9</ref> he obtained the consulship in 120.<ref name=\"Weigel, Antoninus Pius\"/> He was next appointed by the Emperor [[Hadrian]] as one of the four [[proconsul]]s to administer [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]],<ref name=\"Bowman, p. 149\">Bowman, p. 149</ref> then greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as [[proconsul]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], probably during 134\u2013135.<ref name=\"Bowman, p. 149\">Bowman, p. 149</ref>\n\nHe acquired much favor with Hadrian, who adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138,<ref>Bowman, p. 148</ref> after the death of his first adopted son [[Lucius Aelius]],<ref>Bury, p. 517</ref> on the condition that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus, the son of his wife's brother, and Lucius, son of Lucius Aelius, who afterwards became the emperors [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]].<ref name=\"Weigel, Antoninus Pius\"/>\n\n==Emperor==\n\n[[File:Roman Empire in 150 AD.png|thumb|The Roman Empire during the reign of Antoninus Pius.]]\n\nOn his accession, Antoninus' name and style became ''[[Imperator]] [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] [[Pontifex Maximus]]''.

Instead of stirring up persecution against the Christians, he extended to them the strong hand of his protection throughout the empire. Rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor's progress through his dominions, he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its neighbourhood.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}}}\nSome historians have a less positive view of his reign. According to the historian [[J. B. Bury]], {{quote|however estimable the man, Antoninus was hardly a great statesman. The rest which the Empire enjoyed under his auspices had been rendered possible through Hadrian\u2019s activity, and was not due to his own exertions; on the other hand, he carried the policy of peace at any price too far, and so entailed calamities on the state after his death. He not only had no originality or power of initiative, but he had not even the insight or boldness to work further on the new lines marked out by Hadrian.<ref>Bury, p. 524</ref>}}\n\nGerman historian [[Ernst Kornemann]] has had it in his ''R\u00f6mische Geschichte'' [2 vols., ed. by H. Bengtson, Stuttgart 1954] that the reign of Antoninus comprised \"a succession of grossly wasted opportunities,\" given the upheavals that were to come. There is more to this argument, given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus' passing. Kornemann's brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders. [[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] agrees that it is possible that had Antoninus acted decisively sooner (it appears that, on his death bed, he was preparing a large-scale action against the Parthians), the Parthians might have been unable to choose their own time, but current evidence is not conclusive. Grant opines that Antoninus and his officers did act in a resolute manner dealing with frontier disturbances of his time, although conditions for long-lasting peace were not created. On the whole, according to Grant, Marcus Aurelius' eulogistic picture of Antoninus seems deserved, and Antoninus appears to have been a conservative and nationalistic (although he respected and followed Hadrian's example of Philhellenism moderately) Emperor who was not tainted by the blood of either citizen or foe, combined and maintained Numa Pompilius' good fortune, pacific dutifulness and religious scrupulousness, and whose laws removed anomalies and softened harshnesses.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Michael|title=The Antonines: The Roman Empire in Transition|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317972112|pages=14\u201323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FwfDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT28}}</ref>\n\nKrzysztof Ulanowski argues that the claims of military inability are exaggerated, considering that although the sources praise Antoninus' love for peace and his efforts \"rather to defend, than enlarge the provinces\", he could hardly be considered a pacifist, as shown by the conquest of the Lowlands, the building of the [[Antonine Wall]] and the expansion of Germania Superior. Ulianowski also praises Antoninus for being successful in deterrence by diplomatic means.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ulanowski|first1=Krzysztof|title=The Religious Aspects of War in the Ancient Near East, Greece, and Rome: Ancient Warfare Series, Volume 1|date=2016|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004324763|pages=360\u2013361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KX6kDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA358}}</ref>\n\n==Portraits==\n<gallery widths=180 heights=220>\nFile:0 Antoninus Pius - Museo Chiaramonti (Vatican).JPG|Statue of Antonius Pius in military garb and [[muscle cuirass]], from the [[Museo Chiaramonti]] ([[Vatican Museums]]).\nFile:Antoninus Pius (Museo del Prado) 01.jpg|thumb|The bust of Antoninus Pius at the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid\nFile:Antoninus Pius, Palazzo Altemps, Rome (11383990114).jpg|Statue of Antoninus Pius, [[Palazzo Altemps]], Rome\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Descendants==\n\nAlthough only one of his four children survived to adulthood, Antoninus came to be ancestor to four generations of prominent Romans, including the Emperor [[Commodus]].

AES is a variant of Rijndael which has a fixed [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 128 [[bit]]s, and a [[key size]] of 128, 192, or 256 bits. By contrast, Rijndael ''per se'' is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits.\n\nAES operates on a 4 \u00d7 4 [[column-major order]] array of bytes, termed the ''state''.<ref group=\"note\">Large-block variants of Rijndael use an array with additional columns, but always four rows.</ref> Most AES calculations are done in a particular [[Finite field arithmetic|finite field]].\n\nFor instance, if there are 16 bytes, <math>b_0, b_1, ..., b_{15}</math>, these bytes are represented as this two-dimensional array:\n::<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nb_0 & b_4 & b_8 & b_{12} \\\\\nb_1 & b_5 & b_9 & b_{13} \\\\\nb_2 & b_6 & b_{10} & b_{14} \\\\\nb_3 & b_7 & b_{11} & b_{15}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe key size used for an AES cipher specifies the number of transformation rounds that convert the input, called the [[plaintext]], into the final output, called the [[ciphertext]]. The number of rounds are as follows:\n\n* 10 rounds for 128-bit keys.\n* 12 rounds for 192-bit keys.\n* 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.\n\nEach round consists of several processing steps, including one that depends on the encryption key itself. A set of reverse rounds are applied to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same encryption key.\n\n=== High-level description of the algorithm ===\n\n# <tt>KeyExpansion</tt>\u2014round keys are derived from the cipher key using [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael's key schedule]]. AES requires a separate 128-bit round key block for each round plus one more.\n# Initial round key addition:\n## <tt>AddRoundKey</tt>\u2014each byte of the state is combined with a block of the round key using [[bitwise xor]].\n# 9, 11 or 13 rounds:\n## <tt>SubBytes</tt>\u2014a [[linear map|non-linear]] substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a [[Rijndael S-box|lookup table]].\n## <tt>ShiftRows</tt>\u2014a transposition step where the last three rows of the state are shifted cyclically a certain number of steps.\n## <tt>MixColumns</tt>\u2014a linear mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column.\n## <tt>AddRoundKey</tt>\n# Final round (making 10, 12 or 14 rounds in total):\n## <tt>SubBytes</tt>\n## <tt>ShiftRows</tt>\n## <tt>AddRoundKey</tt>\n\n=== The <tt>SubBytes</tt> step ===\n{{Main|Rijndael S-box}}\n[[Image:AES-SubBytes.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the <tt>SubBytes</tt> step, each byte in the state is replaced with its entry in a fixed 8-bit lookup table, ''S''; ''b<sub>ij</sub>'' = ''S(a<sub>ij</sub>)''.]]\nIn the <tt>SubBytes</tt> step, each byte <math>a_{i,j}</math> in the ''state'' array is replaced with a <tt>SubByte</tt> <math>S(a_{i,j})</math> using an 8-bit [[substitution box]]. This operation provides the non-linearity in the [[cipher]]. The S-box used is derived from the [[multiplicative inverse]] over {{math|[[Finite field|GF]](2<sup>8</sup>)}}, known to have good non-linearity properties. To avoid attacks based on simple algebraic properties, the S-box is constructed by combining the inverse function with an invertible [[affine transformation]]. The S-box is also chosen to avoid any fixed points (and so is a [[derangement]]), i.e., <math> S(a_{i,j}) \\neq a_{i,j} </math>, and also any opposite fixed points, i.e., <math> S(a_{i,j}) \\oplus a_{i,j} \\neq \\text{FF}_{16} </math>.\nWhile performing the decryption, the <tt>InvSubBytes</tt> step (the inverse of <tt>SubBytes</tt>) is used, which requires first taking the inverse of the affine transformation and then finding the multiplicative inverse.\n\n=== The <tt>ShiftRows</tt> step ===\n[[Image:AES-ShiftRows.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the <tt>ShiftRows</tt> step, bytes in each row of the state are shifted cyclically to the left. The number of places each byte is shifted differs for each row.]]\nThe <tt>ShiftRows</tt> step operates on the rows of the state; it cyclically shifts the bytes in each row by a certain [[Offset (computer science)|offset]]. For AES, the first row is left unchanged. Each byte of the second row is shifted one to the left. Similarly, the third and fourth rows are shifted by offsets of two and three respectively.<ref group=\"note\">Rijndael variants with a larger block size have slightly different offsets. For blocks of sizes 128 bits and 192 bits, the shifting pattern is the same. Row <math>n</math> is shifted left circular by <math>n-1</math> bytes.  For a 256-bit block, the first row is unchanged and the shifting for the second, third and fourth row is 1 byte, 3 bytes and 4 bytes respectively\u2014this change only applies for the Rijndael cipher when used with a 256-bit block, as AES does not use 256-bit blocks.</ref> In this way, each column of the output state of the <tt>ShiftRows</tt> step is composed of bytes from each column of the input state. The importance of this step is to avoid the columns being encrypted independently, in which case AES degenerates into four independent block ciphers.\n\n=== The <tt>MixColumns</tt> step ===\n{{main|Rijndael MixColumns}}\n[[Image:AES-MixColumns.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the <tt>MixColumns</tt> step, each column of the state is multiplied with a fixed polynomial <math>c(x)</math>.]]\nIn the <tt>MixColumns</tt> step, the four bytes of each column of the state are combined using an invertible [[linear transformation]]. The <tt>MixColumns</tt> function takes four bytes as input and outputs four bytes, where each input byte affects all four output bytes. Together with <tt>ShiftRows</tt>, <tt>MixColumns</tt> provides [[diffusion (cryptography)|diffusion]] in the cipher.\n\nDuring this operation, each column is transformed using a fixed matrix (matrix left-multiplied by column gives new value of column in the state):\n\n::<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nb_{0,j} \\\\ b_{1,j} \\\\ b_{2,j} \\\\ b_{3,j}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n3 & 1 & 1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\na_{0,j} \\\\ a_{1,j} \\\\ a_{2,j} \\\\ a_{3,j}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\qquad 0 \\le j \\le 3\n</math>\n\nMatrix multiplication is composed of multiplication and addition of the entries. Entries are 8-bit bytes treated as coefficients of polynomial of order <math>x^7</math>. Addition is simply XOR. Multiplication is modulo irreducible polynomial <math>x^8+x^4+x^3+x+1</math>. If processed bit by bit, then, after shifting, a conditional [[Exclusive or|XOR]] with 1B<sub>16</sub> should be performed if the shifted value is larger than FF<sub>16</sub> (overflow must be corrected by subtraction of generating polynomial). These are special cases of the usual multiplication in <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2^8)</math>.\n\nIn more general sense, each column is treated as a polynomial over <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2^8)</math> and is then multiplied modulo <math>{01}_{16} \\cdot z^4+{01}_{16}</math> with a fixed polynomial <math>c(z) = {03}_{16} \\cdot z^3 + {01}_{16} \\cdot z^2 +{01}_{16} \\cdot z + {02}_{16}</math>. The coefficients are displayed in their [[hexadecimal]] equivalent of the binary representation of bit polynomials from <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2)[x]</math>. The <tt>MixColumns</tt> step can also be viewed as a multiplication by the shown particular [[MDS matrix]] in the [[finite field]] <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2^8)</math>. This process is described further in the article [[Rijndael MixColumns]].\n\n=== The <tt>AddRoundKey</tt> step ===\n[[Image:AES-AddRoundKey.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the <tt>AddRoundKey</tt> step, each byte of the state is combined with a byte of the round subkey using the [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operation (\u2295).]]\nIn the <tt>AddRoundKey</tt> step, the subkey is combined with the state. For each round, a subkey is derived from the main [[key (cryptography)|key]] using [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael's key schedule]]; each subkey is the same size as the state. The subkey is added by combining each byte of the state with the corresponding byte of the subkey using bitwise [[Exclusive or|XOR]].\n\n=== Optimization of the cipher ===\nOn systems with 32-bit or larger words, it is possible to speed up execution of this cipher by combining the <tt>SubBytes</tt> and <tt>ShiftRows</tt> steps with the <tt>MixColumns</tt> step by transforming them into a sequence of table lookups. This requires four 256-entry 32-bit tables (together occupying 4096 bytes).  A round can then be performed with 16 table lookup operations and 12 32-bit exclusive-or operations, followed by four 32-bit exclusive-or operations in the <tt>AddRoundKey</tt> step.<ref>[http://www.springerlink.com/index/UVX5NQGNN55VK199.pdf \"Efficient software implementation of AES on 32-bit platforms\".] Lecture Notes in Computer Science: 2523. 2003</ref>  Alternatively, the table lookup operation can be performed with a single 256-entry 32-bit table (occupying 1024 bytes) followed by circular rotation operations.\n\nUsing a byte-oriented approach, it is possible to combine the <tt>SubBytes</tt>, <tt>ShiftRows</tt>, and <tt>MixColumns</tt> steps into a single round operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/p/byte-oriented-aes |title=byte-oriented-aes \u2013 A public domain byte-oriented implementation of AES in C \u2013 Google Project Hosting |publisher=Code.google.com |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720155538/http://code.google.com/p/byte-oriented-aes/ |archivedate=2013-07-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\nUntil May 2009, the only successful published attacks against the full AES were [[side-channel attack]]s on some specific implementations. The [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) reviewed all the AES finalists, including Rijndael, and stated that all of them were secure enough for U.S. Government non-classified data. In June 2003, the U.S. Government announced that AES could be used to protect [[classified information]]:\n<blockquote>The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths. The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/documents/aes/CNSS15FS.pdf |title=National Policy on the Use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to Protect National Security Systems and National Security Information |author=Lynn Hathaway |date=June 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106122007/http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/documents/aes/CNSS15FS.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-06 |df= }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAES has 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.\n\nBy 2006, the best known attacks were on 7 rounds for 128-bit keys, 8 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 9 rounds for 256-bit keys.<ref name=\"improved\">[[John Kelsey (cryptanalyst)|John Kelsey]], [[Stefan Lucks]], [[Bruce Schneier]], [[Mike Stay]], [[David A.

The largest successful publicly known brute-force attack against a widely implemented block-cipher encryption algorithm was against a 64-bit [[RC5]] key by [[distributed.net]] in 2006.<ref name=ZD20060430>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/ou/is-encryption-really-crackable/204\n |title=Is encryption really crackable?\n |first1=George\n |last1=Ou\n |publisher=Ziff-Davis\n |date=April 30, 2006\n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rocpRxhN?url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/ou/is-encryption-really-crackable/204\n |archivedate=August 7, 2010\n |accessdate=August 7, 2010\n |deadurl=no\n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nThe key space increases by a factor of 2 for each additional bit of key length, and if every possible value of the key is equiprobable, this translates into a doubling of the average brute-force key search time.

The term ''argot'' is also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study, occupation, or hobby, in which [[word sense|sense]] it overlaps with [[jargon]]. The discipline of medicine has been referred to as having its own argot which includes abbreviations, acronyms, and \"technical colloquialisms\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hukill|first=Peter B.|last2=H.|first2=A.

Holyoke University}}</ref> In his 1862 novel ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]],'' he refers to that argot as both \"the language of the dark\" and \"the language of misery.\"\n\nThe earliest known record of the term ''argot'' in this context was in a 1628 document. The word was probably derived from the contemporary name ''les argotiers'', given to a group of thieves at that time.<ref>Guiraud, Pierre, ''L'Argot. Que sais-je?'', Paris: PUF, 1958, p. 700</ref>\n\nUnder the strictest definition, an ''argot'' is a proper language with its own grammar and style. But such complete secret languages are rare because the speakers usually have some public language in common, on which the argot is largely based. Such argots are mainly versions of another language, with a part of its vocabulary replaced by words unknown to the larger public; ''argot'' used in this [[word sense|sense]] is [[synonym]]ous with ''[[cant (language)|cant]]''. For example, ''argot'' in this sense is used for systems such as ''[[verlan]]'' and ''[[louch\u00e9bem]]'', which retain French syntax and apply transformations only to individual words (and often only to a certain subset of words, such as nouns, or semantic content words).<ref name=\"valdman\">{{cite journal\n | last = Valdman\n | first = Albert\n | title = La Langue des faubourgs et des banlieues: de l'argot au fran\u00e7ais populaire\n | journal = The French Review\n | volume = 73\n | issue = 6\n | pages = 1179\u20131192\n | publisher = American Association of Teachers of French\n | date = May 2000\n | jstor = 399371|language=fr}}</ref> Such systems are examples of ''argots \u00e0 clef'', or \"coded argots.\"<ref name=\"valdman\"/>\n\nSpecific words can go from argot into common speech or the other way.

It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's [[Physical property|physical]] or [[List of materials properties#Mechanical properties|mechanical properties]] ([[absorbance]], [[refractive index]], [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]], [[tensile strength]], etc.) \n\nAn example of anisotropy is light coming through a [[polarizer]]. Another is [[wood]], which is easier to split along its [[wood grain|grain]] than across it.\n\n==Fields of interest==\n\n===Computer graphics===\n\nIn the field of [[computer graphics]], an anisotropic surface changes in appearance as it rotates about its [[Normal (geometry)|geometric normal]], as is the case with [[velvet]].\n\n[[Anisotropic filtering]] (AF) is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on surfaces that are far away and steeply angled with respect to the point of view. Older techniques, such as [[bilinear filtering|bilinear]] and [[trilinear filtering]], do not take into account the angle a surface is viewed from, which can result in [[aliasing]] or blurring of textures. By reducing detail in one direction more than another, these effects can be reduced.\n\n=== Chemistry ===\nA chemical anisotropic [[filter (chemistry)|filter]], as used to filter particles, is a filter with increasingly smaller interstitial spaces in the direction of filtration so that the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] [[region]]s filter out larger particles and [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] regions increasingly remove smaller particles, resulting in greater flow-through and more efficient filtration.\n\nIn [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]], the orientation of nuclei with respect to the applied magnetic field determines their [[chemical shift]].  In this context, anisotropic systems refer to the electron distribution of molecules with abnormally high electron density, like the pi system of [[benzene]]. This abnormal electron density affects the applied magnetic field and causes the observed chemical shift to change.\n\nIn [[fluorescence spectroscopy]], the [[fluorescence anisotropy]], calculated from the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] properties of fluorescence from samples excited with plane-polarized light, is used, e.g., to determine the shape of a macromolecule.\nAnisotropy measurements reveal the average angular displacement of the fluorophore that occurs between absorption and subsequent emission of a photon.\n\n=== Real-world imagery===\nImages of a gravity-bound or man-made environment are particularly anisotropic in the orientation domain, with more image structure located at orientations parallel with or orthogonal to the direction of gravity (vertical and horizontal).\n\n===Physics===<!-- This section is linked from [[Birefringence]] -->\n[[File:Plasma-lamp 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A [[plasma globe|plasma lamp]] displaying the nature of [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]], in this case, the phenomenon of \"filamentation\"]]\n\n[[Physicists]] from [[University of California, Berkeley]] reported about their detection of the cosine anisotropy in [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] in 1977.

A.]] |last-author-amp=yes }}</ref> Cosmic anisotropy has also been seen in the alignment of galaxies' rotation axes and polarisation angles of quasars.\n\nPhysicists use the term anisotropy to describe direction-dependent properties of materials. [[Magnetic anisotropy]], for example, may occur in a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], so that its magnetic field is oriented in a preferred direction. Plasmas may also show \"filamentation\" (such as that seen in [[lightning]] or a [[plasma globe]]) that is directional.\n\nAn ''anisotropic liquid'' has the fluidity of a normal liquid, but has an average structural order relative to each other along the molecular axis, unlike water or [[chloroform]], which contain no structural ordering of the molecules. [[Liquid crystals]] are examples of anisotropic liquids.\n\nSome materials [[heat conduction|conduct heat]] in a way that is isotropic, that is independent of spatial orientation around the heat source.  Heat conduction is more commonly anisotropic, which implies that detailed geometric modeling of typically diverse materials being thermally managed is required. The materials used to transfer and reject heat from the heat source in [[electronics]] are often anisotropic.<ref name=\"Nature8April2013\">{{cite web|last1=Tian|first1=Xiaojuan|last2=Itkis|first2=Mikhail E|last3=Bekyarova|first3=Elena B|last4=Haddon|first4=Robert C|title=Anisotropic Thermal and Electrical Properties of Thin Thermal Interface Layers of Graphite Nanoplatelet-Based Composites|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01710|website=Nature.com|accessdate=11 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811183641/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01710|archivedate=11 August 2016|date=8 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nMany [[crystal]]s are anisotropic to [[light]] (\"optical anisotropy\"), and exhibit properties such as [[birefringence]]. [[Crystal optics]] describes light propagation in these media. An \"axis of anisotropy\" is defined as the axis along which isotropy is broken (or an axis of symmetry, such as normal to crystalline layers). Some materials can have multiple such [[optical axis|optical axes]].\n\n===Geophysics and geology===\n[[Seismic anisotropy]] is the variation of seismic wavespeed with direction. Seismic anisotropy is an indicator of long range order in a material, where features smaller than the seismic [[wavelength]] (e.g., crystals, cracks, pores, layers or inclusions) have a dominant alignment. This alignment leads to a directional variation of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] wavespeed. Measuring the effects of anisotropy in seismic data can provide important information about processes and mineralogy in the Earth; indeed, significant seismic anisotropy has been detected in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[inner core]].\n\n[[Geological]] formations with distinct layers of [[sedimentary]] material can exhibit electrical anisotropy; [[electrical conductivity]] in one direction (e.g. parallel to a layer), is different from that in another (e.g. perpendicular to a layer). This property is used in the gas and [[oil exploration]] industry to identify [[hydrocarbon]]-bearing sands in sequences of [[sand]] and [[shale]]. Sand-bearing hydrocarbon assets have high [[resistivity]] (low conductivity), whereas shales have lower resistivity. [[Formation evaluation]] instruments measure this conductivity/resistivity and the results are used to help find oil and gas in wells.\n\nThe [[hydraulic conductivity]] of [[aquifer]]s is often anisotropic for the same reason. When calculating groundwater flow to [[drainage|drains]]<ref>R.J.Oosterbaan, 1997, The energy balance of groundwater flow applied to subsurface drainage in anisotropic soils by pipes or ditches with entrance resistance.

The corresponding free WellDrain program can be downloaded from: [http://www.waterlog.info/weldrain.htm]</ref> the difference between horizontal and vertical permeability must be taken into account, otherwise the results may be subject to error.\n\nMost common rock-forming [[mineral]]s are anisotropic, including [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]]. Anisotropy in minerals is most reliably seen in their [[optical mineralogy|optical properties]]. An example of an isotropic mineral is [[garnet]].\n\n===Medical acoustics===\nAnisotropy is also a well-known property in medical ultrasound imaging describing a different resulting [[echogenicity]] of soft tissues, such as tendons, when the angle of the transducer is changed. Tendon fibers appear hyperechoic (bright) when the transducer is perpendicular to the tendon, but can appear hypoechoic (darker) when the transducer is angled obliquely. This can be a source of interpretation error for inexperienced practitioners.\n\n===Material science and engineering===\nAnisotropy, in Material Science, is a material's directional dependence of a physical property. Most materials exhibit anisotropic behavior. An example would be the dependence of [[Young's modulus]] on the direction of load.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Kocks\n  |first = U.F.\n  |title = Texture and Anisotropy: Preferred Orientations in Polycrystals and their effect on Materials Properties\n  |publisher = [[Cambridge]]\n  |year = 2000\n  |isbn = 9780521794206}}</ref>\nIn such a case anisotropy could be effectively measured directly from its stiffness tensor independently of its origin which may for instance be its texture, randomness of internal composition or defects.\n<ref>{{cite journal\n| last       = Soko\u0142owski\n| first      = Damian\n| last2      = Kami\u0144ski\n| first2     = Marcin\n| date       = 2018\n| title      = Homogenization of carbon/polymer composites with anisotropic distribution of particles and stochastic interface defects\n| url        = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00707-018-2174-7\n| journal    = Acta Mechanica\n| volume     = 229\n| issue      = 9\n| pages      = 3727\u20133765\n| doi        = 10.1007/s00707-018-2174-7\n| access-date = 21 August 2018\n}}</ref>\n[[Texture (crystalline)|Texture]] patterns are often produced during manufacturing of the material.  In the case of rolling, \"stringers\" of texture are produced in the direction of rolling, which can lead to vastly different properties in the rolling and transverse directions. \nSome materials, such as wood and fibre-reinforced [[composite material|composites]] are very anisotropic, being much stronger along the grain/fibre than across it. Metals and alloys tend to be more isotropic, though they can sometimes exhibit significant anisotropic behaviour. This is especially important in processes such as [[Deep drawing|deep-drawing]].\n\nWood is a naturally anisotropic (but often simplified to be [[transversely isotropic]]) material.  Its properties vary widely when measured with or against the growth grain.  For example, wood's strength and hardness is different for the same sample measured in different orientations.\n\nIn the Mechanics of Continuum Materials, isotropy and anisotropy are rigorously described through the symmetry group of the constitutive relation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-662-10388-3|title=The Non-Linear Field Theories of Mechanics - Springer|last=Truesdell|first=Clifford|last2=Noll|first2=Walter|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-10388-3}}</ref>\n\n===Microfabrication===\n\nAnisotropic etching techniques (such as [[deep reactive ion etching]]) are used in microfabrication processes to create well defined microscopic features with a high [[aspect ratio]].  These features are commonly used in [[microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] and [[microfluidic]] devices, where the anisotropy of the features is needed to impart desired optical, electrical, or physical properties to the device. Anisotropic etching can also refer to certain chemical etchants used to etch a certain material preferentially over certain crystallographic planes (e.g., KOH etching of [[silicon]] [100] produces pyramid-like structures)\n\n===Neuroscience===\n\n[[Diffusion tensor imaging]] is an [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] technique that involves measuring the fractional anisotropy of the random motion ([[Brownian motion]]) of water molecules in the brain.  Water molecules located in [[White matter|fiber tracts]] are more likely to be anisotropic, since they are restricted in their movement (they move more in the dimension parallel to the fiber tract rather than in the two dimensions orthogonal to it), whereas water molecules dispersed in the rest of the brain have less restricted movement and therefore display more isotropy.  This difference in fractional anisotropy is exploited to create a map of the fiber tracts in the brains of the individual.\n\n===Atmospheric radiative transfer===\n[[Radiance]] fields (see [[BRDF]]) from a reflective surface are often not isotropic in nature. This makes calculations of the total energy being reflected from any scene a difficult quantity to calculate. In [[remote sensing]] applications, anisotropy functions can be derived for specific scenes, immensely simplifying the calculation of the net reflectance or (thereby) the net [[irradiance]] of a scene.\nFor example, let the [[BRDF]] be <math>\\gamma(\\Omega_i, \\Omega_v)</math> where 'i' denotes incident direction and 'v' denotes viewing direction (as if from a satellite or other instrument). And let P be the Planar Albedo, which represents the total reflectance from the scene.\n:<math>P(\\Omega_i) = \\int_{\\Omega_v}\\gamma(\\Omega_i, \\Omega_v)\\hat{n}\\cdot d\\hat\\Omega_v</math>\n:<math>A(\\Omega_i, \\Omega_v) = \\frac{\\gamma(\\Omega_i, \\Omega_v)}{P(\\Omega_i)}</math>\n\nIt is of interest because, with knowledge of the anisotropy function as defined, a measurement of the [[BRDF]] from a single viewing direction (say, <math>\\Omega_v</math>) yields a measure of the total scene reflectance (Planar Albedo) for that specific incident geometry (say, <math>\\Omega_i</math>).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Circular symmetry]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|anisotropy}}\n*[http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEsummer05/FEATsum05TBP.html \"Gauge, and knitted fabric generally, is an anisotropic phenomenon\"]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100303080919/http://aluminium.matter.org.uk/content/html/eng/default.asp?catid=99&pageid=1028022659 \"Overview of Anisotropy\"]\n*[http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/anisotropy/index.php DoITPoMS Teaching and Learning Package: \"Introduction to Anisotropy\"]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Orientation (geometry)]]", "sha1": "l2zenikrx3qlm5kxu4l4suyi9uwjnb9"}}, {"title": "Alpha decay", "ns": "0", "id": "1267", "revision": {"id": "865266759", "parentid": "863865939", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T20:33:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "Nfr-Maat", "id": "8219213"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Mechanism */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Alpha Decay.svg|thumb|240px|right|Visual representation of alpha decay]]\n{{Nuclear physics}}\n'''Alpha decay''' or '''\u03b1-decay''' is a type of [[radioactivity|radioactive decay]] in which an [[atomic nucleus]] emits an [[alpha particle]] (helium nucleus) and thereby transforms or 'decays' into a different atomic nucleus, with a [[mass number]] that is reduced by four and an [[atomic number]] that is reduced by two. An alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of a [[helium-4]] atom, which consists of two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s. It has a charge of {{val|+2|ul=e}} and a mass of {{val|4|ul=u}}.  For example, [[uranium-238]] decays to form [[thorium-234]]. Alpha particles have a [[electric charge|charge]] {{val|+2|u=e}}, but as a nuclear equation describes a nuclear reaction without considering the electrons \u2013 a convention that does not imply that the nuclei necessarily occur in neutral atoms \u2013 the charge is not usually shown.\n\nAlpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides. Theoretically, it can occur only in nuclei somewhat heavier than [[nickel]] (element 28), where the overall [[binding energy]] per [[nucleon]] is no longer a minimum and the nuclides are therefore unstable toward spontaneous fission-type processes. In practice, this mode of decay has only been observed in nuclides considerably heavier than nickel, with the lightest known alpha emitters being the lightest [[isotope]]s (mass numbers 106\u2013110) of [[tellurium]] (element 52). Exceptionally, however, [[Isotopes of beryllium|beryllium-8]] decays to two alpha particles.\n\nAlpha decay is by far the most common form of [[cluster decay]], where the parent [[atom]] ejects a defined [[decay product|daughter]] collection of nucleons, leaving another defined product behind. It is the most common form because of the combined extremely high [[binding energy]] and relatively small mass of the alpha particle. Like other cluster decays, alpha decay is fundamentally a [[quantum tunneling]] process. Unlike [[beta decay]], it is governed by the interplay between both the [[nuclear force]] and the [[electromagnetic force]].\n\n[[Alpha particle]]s have a typical kinetic energy of 5&nbsp;MeV (or \u2248&nbsp;0.13% of their total energy, 110&nbsp;TJ/kg) and have a speed of about 15,000,000&nbsp;m/s, or 5% of the [[speed of light]]. There is surprisingly small variation around this energy, due to the heavy dependence of the half-life of this process on the energy produced (see equations in the [[Geiger\u2013Nuttall law]]). Because of their relatively large mass, electric charge of {{val|+2|u=e}} and relatively low velocity, alpha particles are very likely to interact with other atoms and lose their energy, and their forward motion can be stopped by a few centimeters of [[air]]. Approximately 99% of the [[helium]] produced on [[Earth]] is the result of the alpha decay of underground deposits of [[mineral]]s containing [[uranium]] or [[thorium]]. The helium is brought to the surface as a by-product of [[natural gas]] production.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Alpha particle#History of discovery and use}}\nAlpha particles were first described in the investigations of radioactivity by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1899, and by 1907 they were identified as He<sup>2+</sup> ions.\n\nBy 1928, [[George Gamow]] had solved the theory of alpha decay via tunneling. The alpha particle is trapped in a [[potential well]] by the nucleus. Classically, it is forbidden to escape, but according to the (then) newly discovered principles of [[quantum mechanics]], it has a tiny (but non-zero) probability of \"[[quantum tunnelling|tunneling]]\" through the [[potential barrier|barrier]] and appearing on the other side to escape the nucleus. Gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived, from first principles, a relationship between the [[half-life]] of the decay, and the energy of the emission, which had been previously discovered empirically, and was known as the [[Geiger\u2013Nuttall law]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phy.uct.ac.za/courses/phy300w/np/ch1/node38.html |title=Gamow theory of alpha decay |date=6 November 1996 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224200050/http://www.phy.uct.ac.za/courses/phy300w/np/ch1/node38.html |archivedate=24 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Mechanism==\n\nThe [[nuclear force]] holding an atomic nucleus together is very strong, in general much stronger than the repulsive [[electromagnetic force]]s between the protons. However, the nuclear force is also short range, dropping quickly in strength beyond about 1 [[femtometre]], while the electromagnetic force has unlimited range. The strength of the attractive nuclear force keeping a nucleus together is thus proportional to the number of nucleons, but the total disruptive electromagnetic force trying to break the nucleus apart is roughly proportional to the square of its atomic number. A nucleus with 210 or more nucleons is so large that the strong nuclear force holding it together can just barely counterbalance the electromagnetic repulsion between the protons it contains. Alpha decay occurs in such nuclei as a means of increasing stability by reducing size.<ref name=beiser>{{cite book |title=Concepts of Modern Physics\n  |url=http://phy240.ahepl.org/Concepts_of_Modern_Physics_by_Beiser.pdf\n  |year=2003\n  |publisher=McGraw-Hill\n  |isbn=0-07-244848-2\n  |chapter=Chapter 12: Nuclear Transformations\n  |pages=432\u2013434\n  |edition=6th\n  |author1=Arthur Beiser\n}}</ref>\n\nOne curiosity is why alpha particles, helium nuclei, should be preferentially emitted as opposed to other particles like a single [[proton emission|proton]] or [[neutron emission|neutron]] or [[cluster decay|other atomic nuclei]].<ref group=\"note\">These other decay modes, while possible, are extremely rare compared to alpha decay.</ref> Part of the answer comes from [[conservation of wave function symmetry]], which prevents a particle from spontaneously changing from exhibiting [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] (if it had an even number of nucleons) to [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] (if it had an odd number of nucleons) or vice versa. Single proton emission, or the emission of any particle with an odd number of nucleons would violate this conservation law. The rest of the answer comes from the very high [[binding energy]] of the alpha particle. Computing the total disintegration energy given by the equation:\n:<math>E = (m_\\text{i} - m_\\text{f} - m_\\text{p})c^2</math>\nWhere <math>m_\\text{i}</math> is the initial mass of the nucleus, <math>m_\\text{f}</math> is the mass of the nucleus after particle emission, and <math>m_\\text{p}</math> is the mass of the emitted particle, shows that alpha particle emission will usually be possible just with energy from the nucleus itself, while other decay modes will require additional energy. For example, performing the calculation for [[uranium-232]] shows that alpha particle emission would need only 5.4&nbsp;MeV, while a single proton emission would require 6.1&nbsp;MeV. Most of this disintegration energy becomes the [[kinetic energy]] of the alpha particle itself, although to maintain [[conservation of momentum]] part of this energy becomes the recoil of the nucleus itself. However, since the mass numbers of most alpha emitting radioisotopes exceed 210, far greater than the mass number of the alpha particle (4) the part of the energy going to the recoil of the nucleus is generally quite small.<ref name=\"beiser\"/>\n\nThese disintegration energies however are substantially smaller than the [[potential barrier]] provided by the nuclear force, which prevents the alpha particle from escaping. The energy needed is generally in the range of about 25&nbsp;MeV, the amount of work that must be done against electromagnetic repulsion to bring an alpha particle from infinity to a point near the nucleus just outside the range of the nuclear force's influence. An alpha particle can be thought of as being inside a potential barrier whose walls are 25&nbsp;MeV. However, decay alpha particles only have kinetic energies of 4&nbsp;MeV to about 9&nbsp;MeV, far less than the energy needed to escape.\n\nQuantum mechanics, however, provides a ready explanation, via the mechanism of quantum tunnelling. The quantum tunnelling theory of alpha decay, independently developed by George Gamow<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=G.

Essentially, the alpha particle escapes from the nucleus by quantum tunnelling its way out. Gurney and Condon made the following observation in their paper on it:\n<blockquote>It has hitherto been necessary to postulate some special arbitrary \u2018instability\u2019 of the nucleus; but in the following note it is pointed out that disintegration is a natural consequence of the laws of quantum mechanics without any special hypothesis... Much has been written of the explosive violence with which the &alpha;-particle is hurled from its place in the nucleus. But from the process pictured above, one would rather say that the &alpha;-particle almost slips away unnoticed.<ref name=\"gurney-condon\"/></blockquote>\nThe theory supposes that the alpha particle can be considered an independent particle within a nucleus that is in constant motion, but held within the nucleus by nuclear forces. At each collision with the potential barrier of the nuclear force, there is a small non-zero probability that it will tunnel its way out. An alpha particle with a speed of 1.5&times;10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;m/s within a nuclear diameter of approximately 10<sup>\u221214</sup>&nbsp;m will collide with the barrier more than 10<sup>21</sup> times per second. However, if the probability of escape at each collision is very small, the half-life of the radioisotope will be very long, since it is the time required for the total probability of escape to reach 50%. As an extreme example, the half-life of the isotope [[bismuth-209]] is 1.9 x 10<sup>19</sup> years.\n\nThe isotopes in [[beta-decay stable isobars]] that are also stable with regards to [[double beta decay]] with [[mass number]] ''A'' = 5, ''A'' = 8, 143 \u2264 ''A'' \u2264 155, 160 \u2264 ''A'' \u2264 162, and ''A'' \u2265 165 are theorized to undergo alpha decay (\"5\" decay to helium-4 and a [[proton]] or a [[neutron]], and \"8\" decay to two helium-4, the half-life of them ([[helium-5]], [[lithium-5]], and [[beryllium-8]]) are very short, unlike the half-life for all other such nuclides with ''A'' \u2264 209, which are very long. All other such nuclides with ''A'' \u2264 209 are [[primordial nuclide]]s except ''A'' = 146). However, only such nuclides with ''A'' = 5, 8, 144, 146, 147, 148, 151, 186, and \u2265 209 has been observed (the decay has also been searched for such nuclides with ''A'' = 145, 149, 182, 183, 184, 192, 204, and 208). All other mass numbers ([[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]]s) has exactly one theoretically [[stable nuclide]], except possible [[spontaneous fission]] for ''A'' \u2265 93, which has never been observed, and possible [[proton decay]], which has also never been observed)\n\nWorking out the details of the theory leads to an equation relating the half-life of a radioisotope to the decay energy of its alpha particles, a theoretical derivation of the empirical [[Geiger\u2013Nuttall law]].\n\n==Uses==\n[[Americium-241]], an [[alpha emitter]], is used in [[smoke detector]]s. The alpha particles [[Ionization|ionize]] air in an open [[ion chamber]] and a small [[Electric current|current]] flows through the ionized air. Smoke particles from fire that enter the chamber reduce the current, triggering the smoke detector's alarm.\n\nAlpha decay can provide a safe power source for [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s used for [[space probe]]s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/rps/rtg.cfm |title=Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator |work=Solar System Exploration |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> and were used for [[Artificial pacemaker|artificial heart pacemakers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://osrp.lanl.gov/pacemakers.shtml |title=Nuclear-Powered Cardiac Pacemakers |work=Off-Site Source Recovery Project |publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory|LANL]] |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> Alpha decay is much more easily shielded against than other forms of radioactive decay.\n\n[[Static eliminator]]s typically use [[polonium-210]], an alpha emitter, to ionize air, allowing the 'static cling' to dissipate more rapidly.\n\n==Toxicity==\nHighly charged and heavy, alpha particles lose their several [[MeV]] of energy within a small volume of material, along a very short [[mean free path]]. This increases the chance of [[double-strand break]]s to the DNA in cases of internal contamination, when ingested, inhaled, injected or introduced through the skin. Otherwise, touching an alpha source is typically not harmful, as alpha particles are effectively shielded by a few centimeters of air, a piece of paper, or the thin layer of dead skin cells that make up the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]; however, many alpha sources are also accompanied by [[beta decay|beta-emitting]] radio daughters, and both are often accompanied by gamma photon emission.\n\nRBE [[relative biological effectiveness]] quantifies the ability of radiation to cause certain biological effects, notably either [[cancer]] or [[necrosis|cell-death]], for equivalent radiation exposure. Alpha radiation has high [[linear energy transfer]] (LET) coefficient, which is about one ionization of a molecule/atom for every [[angstrom]] of travel by the alpha particle. The RBE has been set at the value of 20 for alpha radiation by various government regulations. The RBE is set at 10 for [[neutron]] irradiation, and at 1 for [[Beta decay|beta radiation]] and ionizing photons.\n\nHowever, the [[recoil]] of the parent nucleus (alpha recoil) gives it a significant amount of energy, which also causes ionization damage (see [[ionizing radiation]]). This energy is roughly the weight of the alpha (4&nbsp;[[Atomic mass unit|u]]) divided by the weight of the parent (typically about 200&nbsp;u) times the total energy of the alpha. By some estimates, this might account for most of the internal radiation damage, as the recoil nucleus is part of an atom that is much larger than an alpha particle, and causes a very dense trail of ionization; the atom is typically a [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]], which preferentially collect on the [[chromosome]]s. In some studies,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=Winters TH, Franza JR\n |year=1982\n |title=Radioactivity in Cigarette Smoke\n |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]]\n |volume=306 |issue=6 |pages=364\u2013365\n |doi=10.1056/NEJM198202113060613\n}}</ref> this has resulted in an RBE approaching 1,000 instead of the value used in governmental regulations.\n\nThe largest natural contributor to public radiation dose is [[radon]], a naturally occurring, radioactive gas found in soil and rock.<ref>[http://www.ans.org/pi/resources/dosechart/ ANS : Public Information : Resources : Radiation Dose Chart<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> If the gas is inhaled, some of the radon particles may attach to the inner lining of the lung.

For example, when used to measure headcount ratio (i.e. the percentage of people living below the line), the $1.25/day line is unable to capture other important measures such as depth of poverty, relative poverty and how people view their own financial situation (known as the \"socially subjective poverty line\").<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/3254/WPS5968.pdf|title = Poor, or Just Feeling Poor?|date = February 2012|accessdate = |website = The World Bank Open Knowledge Repository|publisher = |author=Martin Ravallion}}</ref> Moreover, the calculation of the poverty line relies on several debatable assumptions about purchasing power parity, homogeneity of household size and makeup, and consumer prices used to determine a basket of essential goods. Not to mention the fact that there may be missing data from the poorest and most fragile countries which may muddle the picture even further.\n\nTo address these problems, several alternative instruments for measuring extreme poverty have been suggested which incorporate other factors such as malnutrition and lack of access to a basic education. Thus, the 2010 Human Development Report introduced the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which measures not only income, but also basic needs. Using this tool, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimated that roughly 1.5 billion people remained in extreme poverty as opposed to the conventional figure of 1.2 billion.<ref>United Nations Development Programme.[http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/multidimensional-poverty-index-mpi \"Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)\"]. Retrieved on 17 January 2014.</ref> As this figure is considered more \"holistic\", it may shed new light on relative deprivation within a country.

This tool is useful as development officials, using the \"M0 measure\" of the method (which is calculated by multiplying \"the proportion of people who are poor by the percentage of dimensions in which they are deprived\"), can determine the most likely causes of poverty within a region.<ref>OPHI.[http://www.ophi.org.uk/research/multidimensional-poverty/alkire-foster-method/ \"Alkire-Foster Method\"], 2014.</ref> For example, in the [[Gaza Strip]] of Palestine, using the M0 measure of the Alkire-Foster method reveals that poverty in the region is primarily caused by a lack of access to electricity and drinking water, in addition to widespread overcrowding.

Global zero entails a world in which fewer than 3% of the global population lives in extreme poverty (projected under most optimistic scenarios to be fewer than 200 million people).

Recent World Bank research shows that some countries can get caught in a \"fragility trap\", in which the above factors prevent the poorest nations from emerging from low-level equilibrium in the long run.<ref name=\"worldbank2\">World Bank.[http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Feature%20Story/Stop_Conflict_Reduce_Fragility_End_Poverty.pdf \"Stop Conflict, Reduce Fragility and End Poverty: Doing Things Differently in Fragile and Conflict-affected Situations\"], 2013.</ref> Moreover, most of the reduction in extreme poverty over the past twenty years has taken place in countries that have not experienced a civil conflict or have had governing institutions with a strong capacity to actually govern. Thus, to end extreme poverty, it is also important to focus on the interrelated problems of fragility and conflict.\n\nUSAID defines fragility as a government's lack of both legitimacy (the perception the government is adequate at doing its job) and effectiveness (how good the government is at maintaining law and order, in an equitable manner). As fragile nations are unable to equitably and effectively perform the functions of a state, these countries are much more prone to violent unrest and mass inequality. Additionally, in countries with high levels of inequality (a common problem in countries with inadequate governing institutions), much higher growth rates are needed to reduce the rate of poverty when compared with other nations. Not to mention, after removing China and India from the equation, up to 70% of the world's poor live in fragile states by some definitions of fragility. Looking further, some analysts project extreme poverty will be increasingly concentrated in fragile, low-income states like Haiti, Yemen and the Central African Republic over the coming years.<ref>Nancy Lindborg.[http://blog.usaid.gov/2014/02/to-end-extreme-poverty-tackle-fragility/ \"To End Extreme Poverty, Tackle Fragility\"], USAID.

An Update on Global Poverty and the New Bottom Billion\"], Center for Global Development. September 2012.</ref>\n\nDespite this debate, addressing the problem of fragility remains a very real issue. To help low-income, fragile states make the transition towards peace and prosperity, the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States, endorsed by roughly forty countries and multilateral institutions, was created in 2011. This \"New Deal\", represents an important step towards redressing the problem of fragility as it was originally articulated by self-identified fragile states who called on the international community to not only \"do things differently\", but to also \"do different things\".<ref name=\"pnaec864\">USAID.[http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnaec864.pdf \"Ending Extreme Poverty in fragile contexts\"], January 28, 2014.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, civil conflict also remains a prime cause for the perpetuation of poverty throughout the developing world. Armed conflict can have severe effects on economic growth for a plethora of reasons \u2013 it destroys assets, creates unwanted mass migration, destroys livelihoods and diverts public resources towards war fighting.<ref name=\"pnaec864\"/> Significantly, a country that experienced major violence during 1981\u20132005 had extreme poverty rates 21 percentage points higher than a country with no violence. On average, a civil conflict will also cost a country roughly 30 years of GDP growth.<ref name=\"worldbank2\"/> Therefore, a renewed commitment from the international community to address the deteriorating situation in highly fragile states is necessary to both prevent the mass loss of life, but to also prevent the vicious cycle of extreme poverty.\n\nIn 2013, a prevalent finding in a report by the World Bank was that extreme poverty is most prevalent in what they call low income countries.  In these countries the World Bank found that progress in poverty reduction is slowest, the poor live under terrible conditions and the most affected persons are children age 12 and under.<ref>Olinto, Pedro, et al.

In this document, now widely known as the Millennium Report, Kofi Annan called on the international community \"to adopt the target of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, and so lifting more than 1 billion people out of it, by 2015\". Citing studies that show \"an almost perfect correlation between growth and poverty reduction in poor countries\", Annan urged international leaders to indiscriminately target the problem of extreme poverty across every region.<ref name=\"Annan_2000\">{{cite book |author=[[Kofi Annan|Kofi A.

Notably, the conference brought together more than 170 Heads of State. While world leaders at the summit were encouraged by the reduction of poverty in some nations, they were concerned by the uneven decline of poverty within and among different regions of the globe. However, at the end of the summit, the conference attendees reaffirmed the UN's commitment to achieve the MDGs by 2015 and urged all supranational, national and non-governmental organizations to follow suit.\n\n===Post-2015 Development Agenda===\n\nWith the expiration of the Millennium Development Goals approaching in 2015, the international community is focused on accelerating efforts to achieve the goals laid out in the original MDGs. Overall, there has been significant progress towards reducing extreme poverty, with the MDG 1 target of reducing extreme poverty rates by half, met \"five years ahead of the 2015 deadline\u2026700 million fewer people lived in conditions of extreme poverty in 2010 than in 1990.

[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/poverty.shtml \"Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Poverty & Hunger\"], 2014.</ref> One notable exception to this trend was in Sub-Saharan Africa, the only region where the number of people living in extreme poverty rose from 290 million in 1990 to 414 million in 2010, comprising more than a third of those living in extreme poverty worldwide.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nWith the aforementioned in mind, the UN convened a High Level Panel (HLP) of Eminent Persons, to advise on a [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]. The HLP report, entitled A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies Through Sustainable Development, was published in May 2013. In the report, the HLP wrote that:\n\n<blockquote> Ending extreme poverty is just the beginning, not the end. It is vital, but our vision must be broader: to start countries on the path of sustainable development \u2013 building on the foundations established by the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro12, and meeting a challenge that no country, developed or developing, has met so far. We recommend to the Secretary-General that deliberations on a new development agenda must be guided by the vision of eradicating extreme poverty once and for all, in the context of sustainable development.</blockquote>\n\nThus, the report determined that a central goal of the Post-Millennium Development agenda is to \"eradicate extreme poverty\u2026by 2030\". However, the report also emphasized that the MDGs were not enough, as they did not \"focus on the devastating effects of conflict and violence on development\u2026the importance to development of good governance and institution\u2026nor the need for inclusive growth...\" Consequently, there now exists synergy between the policy position papers put forward by the United States (through USAID), the World Bank and the UN itself in terms of viewing fragility and a lack of good governance as exacerbating extreme poverty. However, in a departure from the views of other organizations, the commission also proposed that the UN focus not only on extreme poverty (a line drawn at $1.25), but also on a higher target, such as $2. The report notes this change could be made to reflect the fact that escaping extreme poverty is \"only a start\".<ref>High Level Panel of Eminent Persons.

A unique vision of the report was the Commission's environmental focus (in addition to a plethora of other goals such as combating hunger and gender inequality). Specifically, the Commission argued, \"long-term poverty reduction\u2026requires inclusive and sustainable growth.

This program, which was unanimously adopted by the conference attendees, argued for internal reforms in LDCs (meant to encourage economic growth) to be complemented by strong international measures. However, despite the major economic and policy reforms initiated many of these LDCs, in addition to strong international aid, the economic situation of these countries worsened as a whole in the 1980s. This prompted the organization of a 2nd UN LDC conference almost a decade later.\n\n'''''2nd UN LDC Conference'''''\n\nHeld between September 3 and September 14, 1990, once again in Paris, the second UN LDC Conference was convened to measure the progress made by the LDCs towards fulfilling their development goals during the 1980s. Recognizing the problems that plagued the LDCs over the past decade, the conference formulated a new set of national and international policies to accelerate the growth rates of the poorest nations. These new principles were embodied in the \"Paris Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s\".<ref>United Nations. [http://www.cinu.org.mx/temas/desarrollo/dessocial/ldc/ldc2_en.pdf \"Paris Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1900s\"], 1992.</ref>\n\n'''''4th UN LDC Conference'''''\n\nThe most recent conference, held in May 2011 in Istanbul, recognized that the nature of development had fundamentally changed since the 1st conference held almost 30 years earlier. In the 21st century, the capital flow into emerging economies has increasingly become dominated by foreign direct investment and remittances, as opposed to bilateral and multilateral assistance. Moreover, since the 80s, significant structural changes have taken place on the international stage. With the creation of the G-20 conference of the largest economic powers, including many nations in the Global South, formerly \"undeveloped\" nations are now able to have a much larger say in international relations. Furthermore, the conference recognized that in the midst of a deep global recession, coupled with multiple crises (energy, climate, food, etc.), the international community would have fewer resources to aid the LDCs. Thus, the UN considered the participation of a wide range of stakeholders (not least the LDCs themselves), crucial to the formulation of the conference.\n\n==Organizations working to end extreme poverty==\n\n===International organizations===\n\n====World Bank====\n\nIn 2013, the Board of Governors of the [[World Bank Group]] (WBG) set two overriding goals for the WBG to commit itself to in the future. First, to end extreme poverty by 2030, an objective that echoes the sentiments of the UN and the Obama administration. Additionally, the WBG set an interim target of reducing extreme poverty to below 9 percent by 2020. Second, to focus on growth among the bottom 40 percent of people, as opposed to standard GDP growth. This commitment ensures that the growth of the developing world lifts people out of poverty, rather than exacerbating inequality.<ref name=\"worldbank1\"/>\n\nAs the World Bank's primary focus is on delivering economic growth to enable equitable prosperity, its developments programs are primarily commercial-based in nature, as opposed to the UN. Since the World Bank recognizes better jobs will result in higher income and thus, less poverty, the WBG seeks to support employment training initiatives, small business development programs and strong labor protection laws. However, since much of the growth in the developing world has been inequitable, the World Bank has also begun teaming with client states to map out trends in inequality and to propose public policy changes that can level the playing field.<ref>World Bank. [http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview#2 \"Poverty Overview\"], 2014.</ref>\n\nMoreover, the World Bank engages in a variety of nutritional, transfer payments and transport-based initiatives. Children who experience under-nutrition from conception to two years of age have a much higher risk of physical and mental disability. Thus, they are often trapped in poverty and are unable to make a full contribution to the social and economic development of their communities as adults. The WBG estimates that as much as 3% of GDP can be lost as a result of under-nutrition among the poorest nations. To combat undernutrition, the WBG has partnered with UNICEF and the WHO to ensure all small children are fully fed. The WBG also offers conditional cash transfers to poor households who meet certain requirements such as maintaining children's healthcare or ensuring school attendance. Finally, the WBG understands investment in public transportation and better roads is key to breaking rural isolation, improving access to healthcare and providing better job opportunities for the World's poor.<ref>World Bank.

OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs)'''''\n\nThe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ([[OCHA]]) of the United Nations works to synchronize the disparate international, national and non-governmental efforts to contest poverty. The OCHA seeks to prevent \"confusion\" in relief operations and to ensure that the humanitarian response to disaster situations has greater accountability and predictability. To do so, OCHA has begun deploying Humanitarian Coordinators and Country Teams to provide a solid architecture for the international community to work through.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unocha.org/|title=Coordination Saves Lives|publisher=OCHA|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''''2. UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund)'''''\n\nThe United Nation's Children's Fund ([[UNICEF]]) was created by the UN to provide food, clothing and healthcare to European children facing famine and disease in the immediate aftermath of World War II. After the UN General Assembly extended UNICEF's mandate indefinitely in 1953, it actively worked to help children in extreme poverty in more than 190 countries and territories to overcome the obstacles that poverty, violence, disease and discrimination place in a child's path. Its current focus areas are 1) Child survival & development 2) Basic education & gender equality 3) Children and HIV/AIDS and 4) Child protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/|title=Children\u2019s Rights & Emergency  Relief Organization|author=|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''''3. UNHCR (The UN Refugee Agency)'''''\n\nThe UN Refugee Agency ([[UNHCR]]) is mandated to lead and coordinate international action to protect refugees worldwide. Its primary purpose is to safeguard the rights of refugees by ensuring anyone can exercise the right to seek asylum in another state, with the option to return home voluntarily, integrate locally or resettle in a third country. The UNHCR operates in over 125 countries, helping approximately 33.9 million persons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/|title=UNHCR Welcome|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''''4. WFP (World Food Program)'''''\n\nThe World Food Program ([[WFP]]) is the largest agency dedicated to fighting hunger worldwide. On average, WFP brings food assistance to more than 90 million people in 75 countries. The WFP not only strives to prevent hunger in the present, but also in the future by developing stronger communities which will make food even more secure on their own. The WFP has a range of expertise from Food Security Analysis, Nutrition, Food Procurement and Logistics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/|publisher=United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) |title=Fighting Hunger Worldwide|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''''5. WHO (World Health Organization)'''''\n\nThe World Health Organization ([[WHO]]) is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, articulating evidence-based policy decisions and combating diseases that are induced from poverty, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Moreover, the WHO deals with pressing issues ranging from managing water safety, to dealing with maternal and newborn health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.org/|title=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Bilateral organizations===\n\n====USAID====\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development ([[USAID]]) is the lead U.S. government agency dedicated to ending extreme poverty. Currently the largest bilateral donor in the world, the United States channels the majority of its \"development\" assistance through USAID and the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]. In President Obama's 2013 [[State of the Union]] address, he declared \"So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades...which is within our reach.\" In response to Obama's call to action, USAID has made ending extreme poverty central to its mission statement.<ref>USAID. [http://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/mission-vision-values \"Mission Statement\"], 2014.</ref> Under its New Model of Development, USAID seeks to eradicate extreme poverty through the use of innovation in science and technology, by putting a greater emphasis on evidence based decision-making, and through leveraging the ingenuity of the private sector and global citizens.<ref>USAID. [http://issuu.com/usaid/docs/usaidannualletter2014 \"Annual Letter\"], 2014.</ref>\n\nA major initiative of the Obama Administration is Power Africa, which aims to bring energy to 20 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa. By reaching out to its international partners, whether commercial or public, the US has leveraged over $14 billion in outside commitments after investing only $7 billion USD of its own. To ensure that Power Africa reaches the region's poorest, the initiative engages in a transaction based approach to create systematic change. This includes expanding access to electricity to more than 20,000 additional households which already live without power.<ref>USAID. [http://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica \"Power Africa\"], 2014.</ref>\n\nIn terms of specific programming, USAID works in a variety of fields from preventing hunger, reducing HIV/AIDS, providing general health assistance and democracy assistance, as well as dealing with gender issues. To deal with [[food security]], which affects roughly 842 million people (who go to bed hungry each night),<ref>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. [http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/2013/en/ \"The State of Food Insecurity in the World\"], 2013.</ref> USAID coordinates the [[Feed the Future Initiative]] (FtF). FtF aims to reduce poverty and undernutrition each by 20 percent over five years. Thanks to the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) and a variety of congruent actors, the incidence of AIDS and HIV, which used to ravage Africa, has reduced in scope and intensity. Through PEPFAR, the United States has ensured over five million people have received life-saving antiviral drugs, a significant proportion of the eight million people receiving treatment in relatively poor nations.<ref>USAID. [http://www.usaid.gov/endextremepoverty \"End Extreme Poverty\"], 2014.</ref>\n\nIn terms of general health assistance, USAID has worked to reduce maternal mortality by 30 percent, under-five child mortality by 35 percent, and has accomplished a host of other goals.<ref>USAID. [http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/global-health \"What We Do: Global Health\"], 2014.</ref> USAID also supports the gamut of democratic initiatives, from promoting human rights and accountable, fair governance, to supporting free and fair elections and the rule of law. In pursuit of these goals, USAID has increased global political participation by training more than 9,800 domestic election observers and providing civic education to more than 6.5 million people.<ref>USAID.

To do so, USAID seeks to increase the capability of women and girls to realize their rights and determine their own life outcomes. Moreover, USAID supports additional programs to improve women's access to capital and markets, builds theirs skills in agriculture, and supports women's desire to own businesses.<ref>USAID.

To do so, DfID focuses on the creation of jobs, empowering women and rapidly responding to humanitarian emergencies.\n\nSome specific examples of DfID projects include governance assistance, educational initiatives, and funding cutting-edge research. In 2014 alone, DfID will support \"freer and fairer\" elections in 13 countries. DfID will also help provide 10 million women with access to justice through strengthened judicial systems and will help 40 million people make their authorities more accountable. By 2015, DfID will have helped 9 million children attend primary school, at least half of which will be girls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development/about|title=About  \u2013 Department for International Development |publisher=GOV.UK|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, through the Research4Development (R4D) project, DfID has funded over 35,000 projects in the name of creating new technologies to help the world's poorest. These technologies include: vaccines for diseases of African cattle, better diagnostic methods for tuberculosis, new drugs for combating malaria, and developing flood-resistant rice. In addition to technological research, the R4D is also used to fund projects that seek to understand what, specifically, about governance structures can be changed to help the world's poorest.<ref>DfID. [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development/about/research \"Research at DfID\"]</ref>\n\n===Non-governmental movements===\n\n====NGOs====\n\nA multitude of non-governmental organizations operate in the field of extreme poverty, actively working to alleviate the poorest of the poor of their deprivation. To name but a few notable organizations: [[Save the Children]], The [[Overseas Development Institute]], [[Concern Worldwide]], [[ONE Campaign|ONE]], trickleUP and [[Oxfam]] have all done a considerable amount of work in extreme poverty.\n\nSave the Children is the leading international organization dedicated to helping the World's indigent children. In 2013 alone, Save the Children reached over 143 million children through their work, including over 52 million children directly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savethechildren.net/|title=Save the Children|work=Save the Children International|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref> Save the Children also recently released their own report titled \"Getting to Zero\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/Getting_to_Zero.pdf |title=Getting to Zero |publisher=[[Save the Children]] |accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> in which they argued the international community could feasibly do more than lift the world's poor above $1.25/day. The [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) is the premier UK based think tank on international development and humanitarian issues. ODI is dedicated to alleviating the suffering of the world's poor by providing high-quality research and practical policy advice to the World's development officials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org/about|title=About ODI|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref> ODI also recently released a paper entitled, \"The Chronic Poverty Report 2014\u20132015: The road to zero extreme poverty\",<ref>[http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/8834.pdf The Chronic Poverty Report 2014\u20132015: The road to zero extreme poverty]</ref> in which its authors assert that though the international communities' goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 is laudable, much more targeted resources will be necessary to reach said target.

This non-governmental organization works prominently in Africa; their mission is to improve local community organizations and it works to reduce impediments to the development of the country. Oxfam helps families suffering from poverty receive food and healthcare to survive. There are many children in Africa experiencing growth stunting, and this is one example of an issue that Oxfam targets and aims to resolve.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfam.org/en/countries/south-africa|title=South Africa - Oxfam International|website=www.oxfam.org}}</ref>\n\n====Campaigns====\n*[[Giving What We Can]]\n*[[Global Poverty Project]]\n*[[Live Below the Line]]\n*[[Make Poverty History]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of countries by percentage of population living in poverty]]\n*[[Income inequality metrics]]\n*[[Least developed countries]]\n*[[Poverty threshold]]\n*[[Poverty reduction]]\n*[[Millennium Development Goals]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|24em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.is/20130403094958/http://knowledgenetwork.alumni.msu.edu/msu-latin-american-caribbean-studies/unmillenniumdevelopmentgoalseradicateextremepovertyandhunger.html Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger by 2015 | UN Millennium Development Goal] curated by the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at Michigan State University\n*[http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/ The Life You Can Save \u2013 Acting Now to End World Poverty]\n*[http://www.whiteband.org/ WhiteBand.org  Global Call to Action Against Poverty]\n*[http://www.halftheskymovement.org/ Half The Sky]\n*[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-extreme-poverty-be-el-2005-09/ Scientific American Magazine (September 2005 Issue) Can Extreme Poverty Be Eliminated?]\n*[http://www.atd-fourthworld.org/ International Movement ATD Fourth World]\n*[http://www.walkinhershoes.org.au/ Walk In Her Shoes]\n\n[[Category:Measurements and definitions of poverty]]", "sha1": "965yzpo31rd4lwari5zqf13r26ai2q9"}}, {"title": "Analytical Engine", "ns": "0", "id": "1271", "revision": {"id": "866547844", "parentid": "866547155", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T00:48:23Z", "contributor": {"ip": "89.25.210.104"}, "comment": "Randell: |ref=harv in wrong place, newline at sfn", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:AnalyticalMachine Babbage London.jpg|thumb|Trial model of a part of the Analytical Engine, built by Babbage, as displayed at the Science Museum (London)<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co62245/babbages-analytical-engine-1834-1871-trial-model-analytical-engines|title=Babbage's Analytical Engine, 1834-1871.

Instead he showed his programs as lists of states during their execution, showing what operator was run at each step with little indication of how the control flow would be guided.\n\n[[Allan G. Bromley]] has assumed that the card deck could be read in forwards and backwards directions as a function of conditional branching after testing for conditions, which would make the engine Turing-complete:\n\n<blockquote>...the cards could be ordered to move forward and reverse (and hence to loop)...{{sfn|Bromley|1982|p=215}}</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The introduction for the first time, in 1845, of user operations for a variety of service functions including, most importantly, an effective system for user control of looping in user programs.\n\nThere is no indication how the direction of turning of the operation and variable cards is specified. In the absence of other evidence I have had to adopt the minimal default assumption that both the operation and variable cards can only be turned backward as is necessary to implement the loops used in Babbage\u2019s sample programs. There would be no mechanical or microprogramming difficulty in placing the direction of motion under the control of the user.{{sfn|Bromley|2000}}</blockquote>\n\nIn their emulator of the engine, [[Fourmilab]] say:\n\n<blockquote>The Engine's Card Reader is not constrained to simply process the cards in a chain one after another from start to finish. It can, in addition, directed by the very cards it reads and advised by the whether the Mill's run-up lever is activated, either advance the card chain forward, skipping the intervening cards, or backward, causing previously-read cards to be processed once again.</blockquote>\n\nThis emulator does provide a written symbolic instruction set, though this has been constructed by its authors rather than based on Babbage's original works.  For example, a factorial program would be written as:\n\n N0 6\n N1 1\n N2 1\n \u00d7\n L1\n L0\n S1\n -\n L0\n L2\n S0\n L2\n L0\n CB?11\n\nwhere the CB is the conditional branch instruction or \"combination card\" used to make the control flow jump, in this case backwards by 11 cards.\n\n== Influence ==\n\n=== Predicted influence ===\n\nBabbage understood that the existence of an automatic computer would kindle interest in the field now known as [[algorithmic efficiency]], writing in his ''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'', \"As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of the science. Whenever any result is sought by its aid, the question will then arise\u2014By what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the ''shortest time''?\"{{sfn|Babbage|1864|p=137}}\n\n=== Computer science ===\n{{sfn|Randell|2013|pp=12-15}}\n\nFrom 1872 Henry continued diligently with his father's work and then intermittently in retirement in 1875.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Babbage Engine \u2014 Key People \u2014 Henry Provost Babbage | publisher=Computer History Museum | url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/henrybabbage/ | accessdate=2011-02-08 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110220215219/http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/henrybabbage/| archivedate= 20 February 2011 }}</ref> \n\n[[Percy Ludgate]] wrote about the engine in 1914 and designed his own Analytical Engine (it was drawn up in detail, but never built) about 1907-1909.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/moderninstrument00horsuoft#page/127/mode/1up/search/1906|title=Modern instruments and methods of calculation : a handbook of the Napier Tercentenary Exhibition|last=Horsburg|first=E.

[[Howard Aiken]], who built the quickly-obsoleted electromechanical calculator, the [[Harvard Mark I]], between 1937 and 1945, praised Babbage's work likely as a way of enhancing his own stature, but knew nothing of the Analytical Engine's architecture during the construction of the Mark I, and considered his visit to the constructed portion of the Analytical Engine \"the greatest disappointment of my life\".{{sfn|Cohen|2000}} The Mark I showed no influence from the Analytical Engine and lacked the Analytical Engine's most prescient architectural feature, [[conditional branching]].{{sfn|Cohen|2000}} [[J.

His maternal great-uncle [[Julius Caesar]] was [[assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] son and heir. Along with [[Mark Antony]] and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]], he formed the [[Second Triumvirate]] to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the [[Battle of Philippi]], the Triumvirate divided the [[Roman Republic]] among themselves and ruled as [[military dictatorship|military dictators]]. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the [[Battle of Actium]] by Octavian in 31 BC.\n\nAfter the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the [[Roman Senate]], the [[Roman magistrate|executive magistrates]], and the [[Roman assemblies|legislative assemblies]]. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including [[commander-in-chief|supreme military command]], and those of [[tribune]] and [[Roman censor|censor]]. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself ''[[Princeps]] Civitatis'' (\"First Citizen of the State\"). The resulting [[Constitution of the Roman Empire|constitutional framework]] became known as the [[Principate]], the [[History of the Roman Empire|first phase of the Roman Empire]].\n\nThe reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the ''[[Pax Romana]]''. The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the \"[[Year of the Four Emperors]]\" over the imperial succession. Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Noricum]], and [[Raetia]], expanding possessions in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], and completing the conquest of [[Hispania]], but suffered a [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|major setback]] in [[Germania]]. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the Empire with a buffer region of [[client state]]s and made peace with the [[Parthian Empire]] through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed [[Roman roads|networks of roads]] with an [[cursus publicus|official courier system]], established a standing army, established the [[Praetorian Guard]], created official [[cohortes urbanae|police]] and [[vigiles|fire-fighting services]] for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city during his reign. Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75, probably from natural causes. However, there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife [[Livia]] poisoned him. He was succeeded as emperor by his adopted son (also stepson and former son-in-law) [[Tiberius]].\n\n== Name ==\nAs a consequence of [[Roman naming conventions|Roman customs]], society, and personal preference Augustus ({{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0|\u02c8|\u0261|\u028c|s|t|\u0259|s|,_|\u0259|\u02c8|\u0261|\u028c|s|-}}; {{IPA-la|aw\u02c8\u0261\u028ast\u028as|classical}}) was known by many names throughout his life:\n\n* '''Gaius Octavius Thurinus''' ({{IPAc-en|\u0252|k|\u02c8|t|e\u026a|v|i|\u0259|s}}): He received his [[Given name|birth name]], after his [[Gaius Octavius (praetor 61 BC)|biological father]], in 63 BC. \"Gaius\" was his first name, \"Octavius\" was his [[surname]], and \"Thurinus\" was his [[cognomen]]{{fact|date=October 2018}}.<ref name=\"history.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/emperor-augustus|title=Augustus - Ancient History - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> Later, his rival [[Mark Antony]] used the name \"Thurinus\" as an insult, to which Augustus replied surprised that \"using his old name was thought to be an insult\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#5|title=Suetonius \u2022 Life of Augustus |website=penelope.uchicago.edu |language=en|access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref><ref name=\"Goldsworthy\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3t8hBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=augustus+biography+Thurinus+name#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Augustus: First Emperor of Rome|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|date=2014-08-28|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300210071|language=en}}</ref> <ref name=\"Goldsworthy\"/>\n* '''Gaius Julius Caesar''': After he was [[Adoption in Rome|adopted]] by Julius Caesar, he adopted Caesar's name in accordance with [[Roman naming conventions]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/augustus/|title=Augustus|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> While he dropped all references to the Octavius family, people colloquially added the epithet '''Octavianus''' to his legal name, either to to differentiate him from his adoptive father or to highlight his more modest origins.

This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.<ref name=\"eck 57\">Eck (2003), 57.</ref>\n\n=== Primary reasons for the Second settlement ===\nThe primary reasons for the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, he was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a [[proconsul]].<ref name=\"eck 56\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 37\">Gruen (2005), 37.</ref> When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary.<ref name=\"eck 56 57\">Eck (2003), 56\u201357.</ref> When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces. Augustus wanted to keep this power.\n\nA second problem later arose showing the need for the Second Settlement in what became known as the \"Marcus Primus Affair\".<ref name=\"Southern p. 109\">Southern, p. 109; Holland, p. 299</ref> In late 24 or early 23&nbsp;BC, charges were brought against Marcus Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the [[Odrysian]] kingdom of [[Thrace]], whose king was a Roman ally.<ref>Wells, p. 53</ref> He was defended by [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena]], who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state.<ref name=\"Southern, p. 108\">Southern, p. 108</ref> Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus.<ref>Holland, p. 300</ref> \n\nSuch orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath\u2014i.e., before Augustus was granted ''imperium proconsulare maius''\u2014as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals.<ref name=\"Southern, p. 108\" /> Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus' policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy&nbsp;\u2013 accusations that had already played out.<ref name=\"Stern, Gaius p. 23\" />\n[[File:Augusto come giove, 00-50 dc circa.JPG|thumb|upright|Augustus as [[Jove]], holding a scepter and orb (first half of 1st century AD)]]\n\nThe situation was so serious that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order.<ref>Syme, p. 333</ref> Murena disbelieved Augustus' testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his ''[[auctoritas]]''. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest.<ref>Syme, p. 333; Holland, p. 300; Southern, p. 108</ref> Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus' testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.<ref>Wells, p. 53; Raaflaub, p. 426</ref>\n\nThe Second Constitutional Settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus' legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general ''imperium proconsulare'', or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus' proconsular imperium into ''imperium proconsulare maius'', or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire.<ref name=\"eck 57\" /> Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" />\n\n=== Additional powers ===\nDuring the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a [[tribune of the plebs|tribune]] (''tribunicia potestas'') for life, though not the official title of tribune.<ref name=\"eck 57\" /> For some years, Augustus had been awarded ''tribunicia sacrosanctitas'', the immunity given to a [[Tribune of the Plebs]]. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|patricians]], a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar.<ref name=\"ccaa 36\">Gruen (2005), 36.</ref> \n\nThis power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" /><ref name=\"eck 57 58\">Eck (2003), 57\u201358.</ref> Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the [[Roman censor]]; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a [[census]] and determine the membership of the Senate.<ref name=\"eck 59\">Eck (2003), 59.</ref>\n\nWith the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum.<ref name=\"ccaa 30\">Eder (2005), 30.</ref> There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor.<ref name=\"bunson 80\">Bunson (1994), 80.</ref> Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state.   However, this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster. The office of the ''tribunus plebis'' began to lose its prestige due to Augustus' amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the [[praetor]]ship.<ref name=\"bunson 427\">Bunson (1994), 427.</ref>\n\n[[File:August Labicana Massimo Inv56230 n2.jpg|thumb|[[Via Labicana Augustus|Head of Augustus]] as [[Pontifex Maximus]], Roman artwork of the late Augustan period, last decade of the 1st century BC]]\nAugustus was granted sole ''imperium'' within the city of Rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular \"imperium\" when they crossed the Pomerium \u2013 the sacred boundary of Rome \u2013 and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or ''auctoritas'', his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus' imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.<ref name=\"eck 60\">Eck (2003), 60.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the [[legatus]] who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces.<ref name=\"eck 61\" /> Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus' proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general.<ref name=\"eck 61\">Eck (2003), 61.</ref> [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger|Lucius Cornelius Balbus]] was the last man outside Augustus' family to receive this award, in 19&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 61\" /> (Balbus was the nephew of Julius Caesar's great agent, who was governor of Africa and conqueror of the [[Garamantes]].)

This caused them to insist upon Augustus' participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22&nbsp;BC, and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19&nbsp;BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#1 54.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#6 6], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#10 10].</ref> \n\nLikewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22&nbsp;BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" /> After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply \"by virtue of his proconsular ''imperium''\", and ended the crisis almost immediately.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" /> It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a ''praefectus annonae'', a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.<ref name=\"eck 78\">Eck (2003), 78.</ref>\n\nThere were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio.<ref name=\"Southern p. 109\"/> Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio.<ref>Swan, p. 241; Syme, p. 483</ref> [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena|Murena]] was named among the conspirators, the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, but it was not a unanimous verdict.<ref>Wells, p. 53; Holland, p. 301</ref> All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured\u2014without ever giving testimony in their defence.<ref>Davies, p. 260; Holland, p. 301</ref> Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.<ref>Holland, p. 301</ref>\n\nIn 19&nbsp;BC, the Senate granted Augustus a form of 'general consular imperium', which was probably 'imperium consulare maius', like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 BC. Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold.<ref name=\"ccaa 43\" /> In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate,<ref name=\"eck 60\" /> as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the [[fasces]], an emblem of consular authority.<ref name=\"ccaa 43\">Gruen (2005), 43.</ref> This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary. On 6 March 12&nbsp;BC, after the death of [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus, the high priest of the college of the Pontiffs, the most important position in Roman religion.<ref>Bowersock (1990), p. 380. The date is provided by inscribed calendars; see also Augustus, ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/2*.html#10 10.2]. Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#27.2 27.2] reports this under 13&nbsp;BC, probably as the year in which Lepidus died (Bowersock (1990), p. 383).</ref><ref name=\"ccaa 28\">Eder (2005), 28.</ref> On 5 February 2&nbsp;BC, Augustus was also given the title ''[[pater patriae]]'', or \"father of the country\".<ref>Mackay (2004), 186.</ref><ref name=\"eck 129\">Eck (2003), 129.</ref>\n\n=== Stability and staying power ===\nA final reason for the Second Settlement was to give the Principate constitutional stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life.<ref>[[The Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#81 81].</ref> If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid in the minds of many citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.<ref>Syme (1939), 337\u2013338.</ref>\n\nAugustus' accumulation of powers were now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the completion of the Second Settlement, 1 July 23 BC.<ref>Everett (2006), 217.</ref> Almost as importantly, the Principate now had constitutional stability. Later Roman Emperors were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often newly appointed Emperors would decline one or more of the honorifics given to Augustus in order to display humility. Just as often, as their reigns progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had been granted them by the Senate. Later Emperors took to wearing the civic crown, consular insignia, and the purple robes of a Triumphant general (''[[toga picta]]''), which became the imperial insignia well into the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era.\n\n== War and expansion ==\n{{Main|Wars of Augustus}}\n{{Further|Roman\u2013Persian relations}}\n[[File:Hermann warrior.jpg|thumb|''The victorious advance of [[Arminius|Hermann]]'', depiction of the 9 AD [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], by [[Peter Janssen]], 1873]]\n\nAugustus chose ''Imperator'' (\"victorious commander\") to be his first name, since he wanted to make an emphatically clear connection between himself and the notion of victory, and consequently became known as ''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus''<ref name=\"eck 93\">Eck (2003), 93.</ref> By the year 13, Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed \"imperator\" as his title after a successful battle.<ref name=\"eck 93\" /> Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the ''Res Gestae'' was devoted to his military victories and honors.<ref name=\"eck 93\" />\n\nAugustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world (to the extent to which the Romans knew it), a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet [[Virgil]] attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus: ''tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento''\u2014\"Roman, remember by your strength to rule the Earth's peoples!\"<ref name=\"ccaa 30\" /> The impulse for [[expansionism]] was apparently prominent among all classes at Rome, and it is accorded divine sanction by Virgil's Jupiter in Book 1 of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', where Jupiter promises Rome ''imperium sine fine'', \"sovereignty without end\".<ref name=\"eck 95\">Eck (2003), 95.</ref>\n\nBy the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal)<ref name=\"eck 94\">Eck (2003),

territory fell under the provinces of Hispania and [[Lusitania]].<ref name=\"eck 97\">Eck (2003), 97.</ref> This region proved to be a major asset in funding Augustus' future military campaigns, as it

territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in Germania to the north.<ref name=\"eck 98\">Eck (2003), 98.</ref> [[Horace]] dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monument [[Trophy of Augustus]] near [[Monaco]] was built to honor the occasion.<ref name=\"eck 98 99\">Eck (2003), 98\u201399.</ref> The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12&nbsp;BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum, and his brother [[Nero Claudius Drusus]] [[Early Imperial campaigns in Germania|moved]] against the Germanic tribes of the eastern [[Rhineland]].<ref name=\"eck 99\">Eck (2003), 99.</ref> Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus' forces reached the [[Elbe]] River by 9&nbsp;BC\u2014though he died shortly

protect Rome's eastern territories from the [[Parthian Empire]], Augustus relied on the [[client state]]s of the east to act as territorial [[Buffer state|buffers]] and areas that could raise their own troops for defense.<ref name=\"eck 96\">Eck (2003), 96.</ref> To ensure security of the Empire's eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius

The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue [[Augustus of Prima Porta]] and in monuments such as the [[Forum of Augustus|Temple of Mars Ultor]] ('[[Mars (mythology)|Mars the Avenger]]') built to house the standards.<ref>Brosius (2006), 97; see also Bivar (1983), 66\u201367.</ref>\n\nParthia had always posed a threat to Rome in the east, but the real battlefront was along the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers.<ref name=\"eck 96\" /> Before the final fight with Antony, Octavian's campaigns against the tribes in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] were the first step in expanding Roman dominions to the Danube.<ref name=\"rowell 13\">Rowell (1962), 13.</ref> Victory in battle was not always a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania.<ref name=\"eck 96\" />\n\nA prime example of Roman loss in battle was the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] in AD 9, where three entire legions led by [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] were destroyed by [[Arminius]], leader of the [[Cherusci]], an apparent Roman ally.<ref name=\"eck 101 102\">Eck (2003), 101\u2013102.</ref> Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany.<ref name=\"bunson 417\">Bunson (1994), 417.</ref> Roman general [[Germanicus]] took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and [[Segestes]]; they defeated Arminius, who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.<ref name=\"Bunson 31\">Bunson (1994), 31.</ref>\n\n== Death and succession ==\n\nThe illness of Augustus in 23&nbsp;BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy.<ref name=\"ccaa 50\" /> If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.<ref name=\"ccaa 50\">Gruen (2005), 50.</ref>\n\nSome Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister's son [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]], who had been quickly married to Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].<ref name=\"eck 114 115\">Eck (2003), 114\u2013115.</ref> Other historians dispute this due to Augustus' will being read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"eck 115\">Eck (2003), 115.</ref> instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus' second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.<ref name=\"ccaa 44\" />\n\nAfter the death of Marcellus in 23&nbsp;BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Vipsania Julia]], [[Agrippina the Elder]], and [[Agrippa Postumus|Postumus Agrippa]], so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the ''imperium'' of a proconsul and the same ''tribunicia potestas'' granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at [[Samos]] in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].<ref name=\"ccaa 44\">Gruen (2005), 44.</ref><ref name=\"eck 58\">Eck (2003), 58.</ref> This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, but it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.<ref name=\"eck 58\" />\n[[File:Augustuksen mauseleomi.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]]]\n\nAugustus' intent became apparent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs when he adopted them as his own children.<ref>Syme (1939), 416\u2013417.</ref> He took the consulship in 5 and 2&nbsp;BC so that he could personally usher them into their political careers,<ref>Scullard (1982), 217.</ref> and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 4.<ref>Syme (1939), 417.</ref> Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus]] (henceforth referred to as Drusus) and [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius]] (henceforth Tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor Drusus. After Agrippa died in 12&nbsp;BC, Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife [[Vipsania Agrippina]] and marry Agrippa's widow, Augustus' daughter Julia\u2014as soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended.<ref name=\"eck 116\">Eck (2003), 116.</ref> Drusus' marriage to [[Antonia Minor]] was considered an unbreakable affair, whereas Vipsania was \"only\" the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage.<ref name=\"eck 116\" />\n\nTiberius shared in Augustus' tribune powers as of 6&nbsp;BC, but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to [[Rhodes]].<ref name=\"eck 117\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 46\">Gruen (2005), 46.</ref> No specific reason is known for his departure, though it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia,<ref name=\"eck 117\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 46\" /> as well as a sense of envy and exclusion over Augustus' apparent favouring of his young grandchildren-turned-sons Gaius and Lucius. (Gaius and Lucius joined the college of priests at an early age, were presented to spectators in a more favorable light, and were introduced to the army in Gaul.)<ref name=\"eck 117 118\">Eck (2003), 117\u2013118.</ref><ref name=\"ccaa 46 47\">Gruen (2005), 46\u201347.</ref>\n\nAfter the early deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his brother Drusus (9&nbsp;BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew [[Germanicus]].<ref name=\"eck 119\">Eck (2003), 119.</ref> This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs.<ref name=\"eck 116\" /> In that year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by AD 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of ''imperium'' with that of Augustus.<ref name=\"eck 119 120\">Eck (2003), 119\u2013120.</ref>\n[[File:Great Cameo of France CdM Paris Bab264 white background.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The deified Augustus hovers over Tiberius and other Julio-Claudians in the [[Great Cameo of France]]]]\n\nThe only other possible claimant as heir was Postumus Agrippa, who had been exiled by Augustus in AD 7, his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree, and Augustus officially disowned him.<ref name=\"ccaa 49\" /> He certainly fell out of Augustus' favor as an heir; the historian Erich S. Gruen notes various contemporary sources that state Postumus Agrippa was a \"vulgar young man, brutal and brutish, and of depraved character\".<ref name=\"ccaa 49\">Gruen (2005), 49.</ref> Postumus Agrippa was murdered at his place of exile either shortly before or after the death of Augustus.\n\nOn 19 August AD 14, Augustus died while visiting [[Nola]] where his father had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustus' death by poisoning fresh figs.<ref>Tacitus ''Annals'' 1.5</ref><ref>Cassius Dio 55.22.2; 56.30</ref> This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus' life, but some historians view it as likely to have been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius' political enemies. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.<ref name=\"Everitt\">{{cite book | title=Agustus: The Life of rome's First Emperor| last=Everitt| first=Anthony| date=2006| pages=312\u201320| publisher=Random House| location=New York| isbn=978-0-8129-7058-6}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, it is possible that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus' health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir.<ref name=\"eck 123\">Eck (2003), 123.</ref> It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.<ref name=\"Everitt\"/>\n\nAugustus' famous last words were, \"Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exit\"\u2014referring to the play-acting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor. Publicly, though, his last words were, \"Behold, I found Rome of clay, and leave her to you of marble.\" An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustus' body from Nola to Rome, and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day.<ref name=\"eck 123\" /> Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two ''[[rostra]]''.<ref name=\"eck 124\">Eck (2003), 124.</ref> Augustus' body was coffin-bound and cremated on a pyre close to [[Mausoleum of Augustus|his mausoleum]].

C. A. Shotter states that Augustus' policy of favoring the Julian family line over the Claudian might have afforded Tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for Augustus after the latter's death; instead, Tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized Augustus.<ref>Shotter (1966), 210\u2013212.</ref> Shotter suggests that Augustus' deification obliged Tiberius to suppress any open resentment that he might have harbored, coupled with Tiberius' \"extremely conservative\" attitude towards religion.<ref name=\"shotter 211\">Shotter (1966), 211.</ref>\n\nAlso, historian R. Shaw-Smith points to letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits.<ref name=\"shaw-smith 213\" /> Shotter states that Tiberius focused his anger and criticism on [[Gaius Asinius Gallus]] (for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her), as well as toward the two young Caesars, Gaius and Lucius\u2014instead of Augustus, the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.<ref name=\"shotter 211\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Further|Cultural depictions of Augustus}}\n[[File:Folio 22r - The Virgin, the Sibyl and the Emperor Augustus.jpg|thumb|The Virgin Mary and Child, the prophetess [[Temple of Vesta, Tivoli|Sibyl Tivoli]] bottom left and the Emperor Augustus in the bottom right, from the ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]''.

Both his adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title ''Augustus'' became the permanent titles of the rulers of the Roman Empire for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at [[Rome|Old Rome]] and at [[Constantinople|New Rome]]. In many languages, ''Caesar'' became the word for ''Emperor'', as in the German ''[[Kaiser]]'' and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian ''[[Tsar]]'' (sometimes Csar or Czar). The cult of ''Divus Augustus'' continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to [[Christianity]] in 391 by [[Theodosius I]]. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements, the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', to be inscribed in bronze in front of [[Mausoleum of Augustus|his mausoleum]].<ref>Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#101.4 101.4].</ref> Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death.<ref name=\"eck 1 2\">Eck (2003), 1\u20132</ref> The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in [[Ankara]] dubbed the ''Monumentum Ancyranum'', called the \"queen of inscriptions\" by historian [[Theodor Mommsen]].<ref name=\"eck 2\">Eck (2003), 2.</ref>\n\nThere are a few known written works by Augustus that have survived such as his poems ''Sicily'', ''Epiphanus'', and ''Ajax'', an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and his written rebuttal to Brutus' ''Eulogy of Cato''.<ref name=\"bunson 47\">Bunson (1994), 47.</ref> Historians are able to analyze existing letters penned by Augustus to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.<ref name=\"shaw-smith 213\">Shaw-Smith (1971), 213.</ref><ref>Bourne (1918), 53\u201366.</ref>\n\nMany consider Augustus to be Rome's greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empire's life span and initiated the celebrated ''Pax Romana'' or ''Pax Augusta''. The Roman Senate wished subsequent emperors to \"[[Felicior Augusto, melior Traiano|be more fortunate than Augustus and better than Trajan]]\". Augustus was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Julius Caesar, and was influenced on occasion by his third wife, Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Rome's first institutionalized [[History of criminal justice|police force]], [[fire fighting]] force, and the establishment of the municipal [[prefect]] as a permanent office.<ref name=\"eck 79\" /> The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.<ref name=\"eck 79\" />\n\nA ''[[praefectus vigilum]]'', or \"Prefect of the Watch\" was put in charge of the [[vigiles]], Rome's fire brigade and police.<ref name=\"bunson 345\">Bunson (1994), 345.</ref> With Rome's civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a [[standing army]] for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"eck 85 86\">Eck (2003), 85\u201387.</ref> This was supported by numerous [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] units of 500 non-citizen soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.<ref name=\"eck 86\">Eck (2003), 86.</ref> They usually equaled or slightly exceeded in number the legions.\n\nWith his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official [[courier]] system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the ''praefectus vehiculorum''.<ref name=\"eck 81\" /> Besides the advent of swifter communication among Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country.<ref name=\"chisholm 122\">Chisholm (1981), 122.</ref> In the year 6 Augustus established the ''[[aerarium militare]]'', donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.<ref name=\"bunson 6\">Bunson (1994), 6.</ref>\n\nOne of the most enduring institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Praetorian Guard in 27&nbsp;BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome.<ref name=\"bunson 341\">Bunson (1994), 341.</ref> They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was [[Maxentius]], as it was [[Constantine I]] who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the [[Castra Praetoria]].<ref name=\"bunson 341 342\">Bunson (1994), 341\u2013342.</ref>\n\n[[File:Augustus-in-Kalabsha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Augustus in an Egyptian-style depiction, a stone carving of the [[New Kalabsha|Kalabsha Temple]] in [[Nubia]]]]\nAlthough the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29&nbsp;BC, Augustus gave 400 sesterces (equal to 1/10 of a Roman pound of gold) each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\" /> He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]] of deities.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\">Eder (2005), 23.</ref> In 28&nbsp;BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\" />\n\n[[File:KujulaKadphisesCoinAugustusImitation.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of [[Kushan]] ruler [[Kujula Kadphises]], in the style of Roman emperor Augustus. [[British Museum]]]]\nThe longevity of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success. As [[Tacitus]] wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate.<ref>Tacitus, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#3|I.3]]</ref> Had Augustus died earlier (in 23&nbsp;BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a [[de facto]] monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title.<ref name=\"eck 124\" /> The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.<ref name=\"kelsall 120\">Kelsall (1976), 120.</ref>\n\nHowever, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] (d. AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican [[liberty]] in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime.<ref name=\"starr 5\">Starr (1952), 5.</ref> In the beginning of his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (c. 56\u2013c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery.<ref name=\"starr 5\" /> He continued to say that, with Augustus' death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another.<ref name=\"starr 5\" /> Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus:\n\n{{quote|Intelligent people praised or criticized him in varying ways. One opinion was as follows. Filial duty and a national emergency, in which there was no place for law-abiding conduct, had driven him to civil war\u2014and this can neither be initiated nor maintained by decent methods. He had made many concessions to Anthony and to Lepidus for the sake of vengeance on his father's murderers. When Lepidus grew old and lazy, and Anthony's self-indulgence got the better of him, the only possible cure for the distracted country had been government by one man. However, Augustus had put the state in order not by making himself king or dictator, but by creating the Principate. The Empire's frontiers were on the ocean, or distant rivers. Armies, provinces, fleets, the whole system was interrelated. Roman citizens were protected by the law. Provincials were decently treated. Rome itself had been lavishly beautified. Force had been sparingly used\u2014merely to preserve peace for the majority.<ref>Tacitus, The Annals, I 9</ref>}}\n[[File:Augustus Bronze X23322 NAMAthens.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a bronze equestrian statue of Augustus, 1st century AD, [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]]\n[[File:VirgilAeneidVI.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Virgil]] reading the [[Aeneid]] to Augustus and Octavia'', by [[Jean-Joseph Taillasson]], 1787]]\nAccording to the second opposing opinion:\n{{quote|filial duty and national crisis had been merely pretexts.

The story of his career shows that Augustus was indeed ruthless, cruel, and ambitious for himself. This was only in part a personal trait, for upper-class Romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel. However, he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism, based on a nostalgia of Rome's antique virtues. In his capacity as ''princeps'', selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind. While fighting for dominance, he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life. He was devious, untrustworthy, and bloodthirsty. But once he had established his authority, he governed efficiently and justly, generally allowed freedom of speech, and promoted the rule of law. He was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any [[Democracy in Ancient Rome|democratic]] parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity. He suffered from no delusions of grandeur.<ref>[[Anthony Everitt|Everitt]] (2006), 324\u2013325.</ref>}}\n\nTacitus was of the belief that [[Nerva]] (r. 96\u201398) successfully \"mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty\".<ref name=\"starr 6\">Starr (1952), 6.</ref> The 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an [[Autocracy|autocrat]].<ref name=\"starr 5\" /> The poet [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus]] (AD 39\u201365) was of the opinion that Caesar's victory over Pompey and the fall of [[Cato the Younger]] (95 BC\u201346&nbsp;BC) marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome; historian Chester G.

[[British Museum]]]]\n\nAugustus' public [[revenue]] reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done.<ref name=\"eck 83 84\" /> This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.<ref name=\"eck 83 84\">Eck (2003), 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nThe measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province.<ref name=\"bunson 404\">Bunson (1994), 404.</ref> Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces.<ref name=\"bunson 404\" /> Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the [[next of kin]].<ref name=\"bunson 404\" />\n\n[[File:HymiariteKingdomAugustusImitation1stCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|left|1st century coin of the [[Himyarite]] Kingdom, southern coast of the [[Arabian peninsula]]. This is also an imitation of a coin of Augustus.]]\n\nAn equally important reform was the abolition of private [[tax farming]], which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome.<ref name=\"eck 83 84\" /> These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, and the right to tax local areas.<ref name=\"eck 83 84\" />\n\nRome's revenue equaled the amount of the successful bids to farm the taxes. The tax farmers' profits consisted of additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Rome's blessing or turning a blind eye. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire to maximize their profits, produced a system of arbitrary exactions regarded quite rightly as barbarously cruel to taxpayers, unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.\n\nThe use of Egypt's immense land rents to finance the Empire's operations resulted from Augustus' conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government.<ref name=\"bunson 144\">Bunson (1994), 144.</ref> As it was effectively considered Augustus' private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperor's patrimonium.<ref name=\"bunson 144 145\">Bunson (1994), 144\u2013145.</ref> Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming [[Praetorian prefect|Prefect of the Praetorian Guard]].<ref name=\"bunson 145\">Bunson (1994), 145.</ref> The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions,<ref name=\"bunson 144\" /> as well as [[bread and circuses]] for the population of Rome.\n\nDuring his reign the [[Venatio|circus games]] resulted in the killing of 3,500 [[North African elephant|elephants]].<ref name=\"Woolf2007\">{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&q=3%2C500+elephants|year=2007|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=397}}</ref>\n\n=== Month of August ===\nThe month of August (Latin: ''Augustus'') is named after Augustus; until his time it was called [[Sextilis]] (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original [[Roman calendar]] and the Latin word for six is ''sex'').

Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see [[Julian calendar]]). According to a ''senatus consultum'' quoted by [[Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius|Macrobius]], Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.<ref>Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#12.35 1.12.35].</ref>\n\n=== Building projects ===\n{{Main|:Category:Augustan building projects}}\n{{Further|Vitruvius|De architectura}}\n[[File:RomaAraPacisDecorazioneVegetale.jpg|thumb|Close up on the sculpted detail of the [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Peace), 13&nbsp;BC to 9 BC]]\n\nOn his deathbed, Augustus boasted \"I found a Rome of bricks; I leave to you one of marble.\" Although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this, Cassius Dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the Empire's strength.<ref name=\"dio 56.30.3\">Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/56*.html#30 56.30.3]</ref> [[Marble]] could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.<ref name=\"bunson 34\" />\n\nAlthough this did not apply to the [[Subura]] slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the [[Campus Martius]], with the [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central [[gnomon]] was an [[obelisks of Rome|obelisk]] taken from Egypt.<ref name=\"eck 122\">Eck (2003), 122.</ref> The [[relief]] sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the ''Res Gestae''.<ref name=\"bunson 32\">Bunson (1994), 32.</ref> Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the [[praetor]]ians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.<ref name=\"bunson 32\" />\n\nHe also built the [[Temple of Caesar]], the [[Baths of Agrippa]], and the [[Forum of Augustus]] with its [[Temple of Mars Ultor]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://classics.mit.edu/Augustus/deeds.html|title= The Deeds of the Divine Augustus\n|author= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> Other projects were either encouraged by him, such as the [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus (minor)|Theatre of Balbus]], and Agrippa's construction of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], or funded by him in the name of others, often relations (e.g. [[Porticus Octaviae|Portico of Octavia]], [[Theatre of Marcellus]]).

[[Ice shelf|Ice shelves]] and [[ice rise|rises]] populate the ice sheet on the periphery.\n\nIn September 2018, researchers at the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] released a [https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/rema/ high resolution terrain map] (detail down to the size of a car, and less in some areas) of Antarctica, named the \"[[Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica]]\" ([[REMA]]).<ref name=\"NYT-20180907\">{{cite news |last=Stirone |first=Shannon |title=New Antarctica Map Is Like \u2018Putting on Glasses for the First Time and Seeing 20/20\u2019 \u2013 A high resolution terrain map of Earth\u2019s frozen continent will help researchers better track changes on the ice as the planet warms. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/science/antarctica-map-rema.html |date=7 September 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=9 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Regions==\n[[File:Antarctica.A2010286.0735.250m.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Princesses Astrid and Ragnhild Coasts]]\n[[File:Antarctica.A2010287.0140.250m.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Banzare, Sabrina, and Budd Law Dome Coasts]]\nPhysically, Antarctica is divided in two by [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Western Antarctica]] and [[Eastern Antarctica]] correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich meridian]]. This usage has been regarded as [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] by some, and the alternative terms Lesser Antarctica and Greater Antarctica (respectively) are sometimes preferred.\n\nLesser Antarctica is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. There has been some concern about this [[ice sheet]], because there is a small chance that it will collapse. If it does, ocean levels would rise by a few metres in a very short period of time.\n\n==Volcanoes==\nThere are four volcanoes on the mainland of Antarctica that are\nconsidered to be active on the basis of observed fumarolic activity or \n\"recent\" tephra deposits: \n[[Mount Melbourne]] (2,730 m) (74\u00b021'S., 164\u00b042'E.), a stratovolcano; \n[[Mount Berlin]] (3,500 m) (76\u00b003'S., 135\u00b052'W.), a stratovolcano; \nMount Kauffman (2,365 m) (75\u00b037'S., 132\u00b025'W.), a stratovolcano; and \n[[Mount Hampton]] (3,325 m) (76\u00b029'S., 125\u00b048'W.), a volcanic caldera.\n \nSeveral volcanoes on offshore islands have records of historic activity.\n[[Mount Erebus]] (3,795 m), a stratovolcano on\n[[Ross Island]] with 10 known eruptions and 1 suspected eruption.\nOn the opposite side of the continent, \n[[Deception Island]]\n(62\u00b057'S., 60\u00b038'W.), a volcanic caldera with 10 known\nand 4 suspected eruptions, have been the most active.\n[[Buckle Island]] in the [[Balleny Islands]] (66\u00b050'S., 163\u00b012'E.), \n[[Penguin Island (South Shetland Islands)|Penguin Island]] (62\u00b006'S., 57\u00b054'W.), \n[[Paulet Island]] (63\u00b035'S., 55\u00b047'W.), and \n[[Lindenberg Island]] (64\u00b055'S., 59\u00b040'W.) are also \nconsidered to be active.

Due to the fragility of the Antarctic environment, only a limited amount of transport movements can take place and sustainable transportation technologies have to be used to reduce the [[ecological footprint]].\nThe infrastructure of land, water and air transport needs to be safe and sustainable. \nCurrently thousands of tourists and hundreds of scientists a year depend on the Antarctic transportation system.\n\n==Land transport==\n\n===Roads===\n\nWinds continuously blow snow on roads in Antarctica.\n\nThe [[South Pole Traverse]] (McMurdo\u2013South Pole highway) is approximately {{convert|1450|km|abbr=on}} long and links the United States' [[McMurdo Station]] on the coast to the [[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]]. It was constructed by leveling snow and filling in [[crevasse]]s, but is not [[Road surface|paved]]. There are flags to mark the route.\n\nAlso, the [[United States Antarctic Program]] maintains two ice roads during the austral summer. One provides access to [[Pegasus Field]] on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]. The ice road between [[Pegasus Field]] and [[McMurdo Station]] is about 14 miles. The other road provides access to the [[Ice Runway]], which is on [[sea ice]]. The road between the [[Ice Runway]] and [[McMurdo Station]] varies in length from year to year depending on many factors, including ice stability. These roads are critical for resupplying [[McMurdo Station]], [[Scott Base]], and [[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]].\n\n===Vehicles===\n\nThe scarcity and poor quality of road infrastructure limits land transportation by conventional vehicles.\n\nA normal car on tires has very limited capability for Antarctic conditions.  Scientific bases are often built on snow free areas (oases) close to the\nocean.  Around these stations and on a hard packed snow or ice, tire based vehicles can drive but on deeper and softer snow, a normal tire based vehicle cannot travel.  Due to these limitation vehicles on belts have been the preferred option in Antarctica.  In 1997 two specialized cars with very large tires running tire pressure as low as 1.5psi/0.1bar travelled onto the high Antarctica Plateau, giving strong indication that tire based vehicles could be an option for efficient travelling in Antarctica.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Mawson Station]] started using classic [[Volkswagen Beetle]]s, the first production cars to be used in Antarctica. The first of these was named \"Antarctica 1\".\n\nIn December 1997 into February 1998 two AT44, 4x4 cars (built in Iceland by Arctic Trucks with tire size of 44-inch tall) joined an expedition by the Swedish Polar Institution (SWEA).  The cars got used to transport people and supplies from the Ice shelf to WASA station, to perform scanning of the snow and support a drilling expedition to on the Antarctica Plateau 76\u00b0S 8\u00b003'W.  This is the first time tire based vehicles successfully travel on the Antarctica high plateau.\n\nIn 2006 a team of six people took part in the [[Ice Challenger Expedition]]. Travelling in a specially designed six wheel drive vehicle, the team completed the journey from the [[Antarctic]] coast at Patriot Hills to the geographic [[South Pole]] in 69 hours. In doing so they easily beat the previous record of 24 days. They arrived at the South Pole on December 12, 2005.<ref>[http://www.icechallenger.co.uk/ Ice Challenger 2005 <!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128092753/http://www.icechallenger.co.uk/ |date=November 28, 2006 }} Retrieved on 2008-10-14</ref>\n\nThe team members on that expedition were [[Andrew Regan]], [[Jason De Carteret]], Andrew Moon, Richard Griffiths, Gunnar Egilsson and Andrew Miles. The expedition successfully showed that wheeled transport on the continent is not only possible but also often more practical. The expedition also hoped to raise awareness about global warming and climate change.\n\nFrom start of December 2008 into February 2009, four AT44, 4x4 cars were used to support a ski race by Amundsen Omega 3, from S82\u00b0 41' E17\u00b0 43' to South Pole.   A film was made of this race by BBC called \"On Thin Ice\" with Ben Fogle and James Cracknell.   The cars started from Novo airbase at S70\u00b0 49' E11\u00b0 38', establish a route onto the plateau through the crevasse areas in the Shcherbakov Mountain Range driving nearly 1500&nbsp;km to the start line of the ski race.  For the return journey each car covered between 5400 and 5800&nbsp;km with one fuel depot on the way.\n\nFrom 2008 to date (Dec 2015) tire based cars, AT44 4x4 and AT44 6x6 have been used every season to support various NGO and scientific expedition/projects, supporting flights, fuel drops, filming, skiers, biker, a tractor, collecting snow samples and more.  The combined distance covered on the Antarctica Plateau is over 220 thousand km and even though towing capacity is much lower than for most belt based vehicles, the tire based cars multiply the travel speed and use only a fraction of the fuel making this an option for some expeditions/projects.\n\nA second expedition led by Andrew Regan and Andrew Moon departed in November 2010. The Moon-Regan Trans Antarctic Expedition this time traversed the entire continent twice, using two six-wheel-drive vehicles and a Concept Ice Vehicle designed by Lotus.<ref>[http://www.transantarcticexpedition.com/ Trans Antarctic Expedition <!-- Bot generated title -->] Retrieved on 2011-02-20</ref> This time the team used the expedition to raise awareness about the global environmental importance of the Antarctic region and to show that [[biofuel]] can be a viable and environmentally friendly option.\n\n==Water transport==\n[[File:National Geographic Explorer in fast ice, Antarctica - edit 1.jpg|thumb|A tour boat in fast ice near the coast]]\nAntarctica's only harbour is at [[McMurdo Station]]. Most coastal stations have offshore anchorages, and supplies are transferred from ship to shore by small boats, barges, and helicopters. A few stations have a basic wharf facility. All ships at port are subject to inspection in accordance with Article 7, [[Antarctic Treaty]]. Offshore anchorage is sparse and intermittent, but poses no problem to sailboats designed for the ice, typically with lifting keels and long shorelines.\n[[McMurdo Station]] ({{coord|77|51|S|166|40|E|}}), [[Palmer Station]] ({{coord|64|43|S|64|03|W|}}); government use only except by permit (see Permit Office under \"Legal System\"). A number of tour boats, ranging from large motorized vessels to small sailing yachts, visit the Antarctic Peninsula during the summer months (January\u2013March). Most are based in [[Ushuaia]], Argentina.\n\n==Air transport==\nTransport in Antarctica takes place by air, using fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.\nRunways and helicopter pads have to be kept snow free to ensure safe take off and landing conditions.\n\nAntarctica has [[List of airports in Antarctica|20 airports]], but there are no developed public-access airports or landing facilities. Thirty stations, operated by 16 national governments party to the [[Antarctic Treaty]], have landing facilities for either helicopters and/or fixed-wing aircraft; commercial enterprises operate two additional air facilities.\n\nHelicopter pads are available at 27 stations; runways at 15 locations are gravel, sea-ice, blue-ice, or compacted snow suitable for landing wheeled, fixed-wing aircraft; of these, one is greater than 3&nbsp;km in length, six are between 2&nbsp;km and 3&nbsp;km in length, 3 are between 1&nbsp;km and 2&nbsp;km in length, three are less than 1&nbsp;km in length, and two are of unknown length; snow surface skiways, limited to use by ski-equipped, fixed-wing aircraft, are available at another 15 locations; of these, four are greater than 3&nbsp;km in length, three are between 2&nbsp;km and 3&nbsp;km in length, two are between 1&nbsp;km and 2&nbsp;km in length, two are less than 1&nbsp;km in length, and data is unavailable for the remaining four.\n\nAntarctic airports are subject to severe restrictions and limitations resulting from extreme seasonal and geographic conditions; they do not meet [[ICAO]] standards, and advance approval from the respective governmental or nongovernmental operating organization is required for landing (1999 est.) Flights to the continent in the permanent darkness of the winter are normally only undertaken in an emergency, with burning barrels of fuel to outline a runway. On September 11, 2008, a United States Air Force [[C-17 Globemaster III]] successfully completed the first landing in Antarctica using [[night-vision goggles]] at [[Pegasus Field]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=1544|title=Air Force successfully tests new capability to fly any time of year to McMurdo|work=Antarctic Sun|first=Peter|last=Rejcek|date=September 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2001 an emergency evacuation of Dr. Ronald Shemenski was needed from [[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]] when he contracted [[pancreatitis]]. Three [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] were called back before their final leg because of weather. Organizers then called on [[Kenn Borek Air]] based in [[Calgary, Alberta]]. Two [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|de Havilland Twin Otters]] were dispatched out of Calgary with one being back-up. Twin Otters are specifically designed for the Canadian north and Kenn Borek Air's motto is \"Anywhere, Anytime, World-Wide\". The mission was a success but not without difficulties and drawbacks. Ground crews needed to create a 2&nbsp;km runway with tracked equipment not designed to operate in the low temperatures at that time of year, the aircraft controls had to be \"jerry-rigged\" when the flaps were frozen in position after landing, and instruments were not reliable because of the cold. When they saw a \"faint pink line on the horizon\" they knew they were going in the right direction.  This was the first rescue from the South Pole during winter.<ref name=CNNtranscript-2001-04-26>{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0104/26/bn.02.html |title= Plane With Dr. Shemenski Arrives in Chile |date= April 26, 2001 |accessdate= January 23, 2013 |author= Transcript |publisher= CNN }}</ref> Canada honoured the Otter crew for bravery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=81222&page=1 |title=Polar Doc Rescuers Battle Time, Weather \u2013 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/w5/canadians-pulled-off-daring-2001-south-pole-rescue-1.1127682 |title=Canadians pulled off daring 2001 South Pole rescue |publisher=Ctvnews.ca |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-11}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Tourism in Antarctica]]\n*[[List of airports in Antarctica]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121002051157/http://www.polar.se/en/research/logistics Webpage of the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat on logistics]\n\n{{Antarctica}}\n\n[[Category:Transport in Antarctica| ]]", "sha1": "o93qj6tspnqw7zw0h7yjk57xtxpj6ld"}}, {"title": "Military of Antarctica", "ns": "0", "id": "1280", "redirect": {"title": "Military activity in the Antarctic"}, "revision": {"id": "102090287", "parentid": "101572387", "timestamp": "2007-01-20T22:50:08Z", "contributor": {"username": "Nick-D", "id": "415269"}, "comment": "redirected to Military activity in the Antarctic", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Military activity in the Antarctic]]", "sha1": "ia6iv49tcw9tb7fnnq91oj3mjkefaj0"}}, {"title": "Geography of Alabama", "ns": "0", "id": "1285", "revision": {"id": "844243764", "parentid": "844242557", "timestamp": "2018-06-03T16:56:43Z", "contributor": {"username": "Gaius Cornelius", "id": "293907"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Apply [[Template:Convert]] and tidy using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{More citations needed|date=April 2007}}\n[[Image:Physio-al.jpg|right|frame|Physiographic regions in Alabama]]\n[[Image:AlaCounties.png|right|thumb|260px|Political Regions of Alabama]]\n\nThe '''[[geography]] of [[Alabama]]''' describes a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Southeastern United States]] in [[North America]]. Alabama is 30th in size and borders four [[U.S. state]]s: Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida. It also borders the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n==Physical features==\n{{See also|Geology of Alabama}}\nExtending entirely across the state of Alabama for about {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} northern boundary, and in the middle stretching {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} farther south, is the [[Cumberland Plateau]], or [[Tennessee Valley]] region, broken into broad tablelands by the dissection of rivers. In the northern part of this plateau, west of [[Jackson County, Alabama|Jackson county]], there are about {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2}} of level highlands from {{convert|700|to|800|ft|m|-1}} above sea level. South of these highlands, occupying a narrow strip on each side of the [[Tennessee River]], is a country of gentle rolling lowlands varying in elevation from {{convert|500|to|800|ft|m|-1}}. To the northeast of these highlands and lowlands is a rugged section with steep mountain-sides, deep narrow coves and valleys, and flat mountain-tops. Its elevations range from {{convert|400|to|1800|ft|m|-1}}. In the remainder of this region, the southern portion, the most prominent feature is ''Little Mountain'', extending about {{convert|80|mi|km|0}} from east to west between two valleys, and rising precipitously on the north side {{convert|500|ft|m|-1}} above them or {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above the sea.\n\nAdjoining the Cumberland Plateau region on the southeast is the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Appalachian Valley]] (locally known as Coosa Valley) region, which is the southern extremity of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and occupies an area within the state of about {{convert|8000|sqmi|km2|-3}}. This is a [[limestone]] belt with parallel hard rock ridges left standing by erosion to form mountains. Although the general direction of the mountains, ridges, and valleys is northeast and southwest, irregularity is one of the most prominent characteristics. In the northeast are several flat-topped mountains, of which Raccoon and [[Lookout Mountain|Lookout]] are the most prominent, having a maximum elevation near the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] line of little more than {{convert|1800|ft|m|-1}} and gradually decreasing in height toward the southwest, where [[Sand Mountain (Alabama)|Sand Mountain]] is a continuation of Raccoon. South of these the mountains are marked by steep northwest sides, sharp crests and gently sloping southeast sides.\n\nSoutheast of the Appalachian Valley region, the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]] also crosses the Alabama border from the N.E. and occupies a small triangular-shaped section of which [[Randolph County, Alabama|Randolph]] and [[Clay County, Alabama|Clay]] counties, together with the northern part of [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] and [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], form the principal portion. Its surface is gently undulating and has an elevation of about {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2}} above sea level. The Piedmont Plateau is a lowland worn down by erosion on hard crystalline rocks, then uplifted to form a plateau.\n\nThe remainder of the state is occupied by the ''Coastal Plain''. This is crossed by foot-hills and rolling prairies in the central part of the state, where it has a mean elevation of about {{convert|600|ft|m|-1}}, becomes lower and more level toward the southwest, and in the extreme south is flat and but slightly elevated above the sea.\nThe Cumberland Plateau region is drained to the west-northwest by the [[Tennessee River]] and its tributaries; all other parts of the state are drained to the southwest. In the Appalachian Valley region the [[Coosa River]] is the principal river; and in the Piedmont Plateau, the [[Tallapoosa River]]. In the Coastal Plain are the [[Tombigbee River]] in the west, the [[Alabama River]] (formed by the Coosa and Tallapoosa) in the western central, and in the east the [[Chattahoochee River]], which forms almost half of the Georgia boundary. The Tombigbee and Alabama rivers unite near the southwest corner of the state, their waters discharging into [[Mobile Bay]] by the [[Mobile River|Mobile]] and Tensas rivers. The [[Black Warrior River]] is a considerable stream which joins the Tombigbee from the east.\n\nThe valleys in the north and northeast are usually deep and narrow, but in the Coastal Plain they are broad and in most cases rise in three successive terraces above the stream. The harbour of Mobile was formed by the drowning of the lower part of the valley of the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers as a result of the sinking of the land here, such sinking having occurred on other parts of the Gulf coast.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n\nThe fauna and flora of Alabama are similar to those of the Gulf states in general and have no distinctive characteristics. However, the [[Mobile River]] system has a high incidence of endemism among freshwater mollusks and biodiversity is high.\n\nIn Alabama, vast forests of [[pine]] constitute the largest proportion of the state's forest growth. There is also an abundance of [[Taxodium|cypress]], [[hickory]], [[oak]], [[populus]], and [[juniperus virginiana|eastern redcedar]] trees. In other areas, [[conium|hemlock]] growths in the north and [[chamaecyparis thyoides|southern white cedar]] in the southwest. Other native trees include [[ash tree|ash]], [[celtis|hackberry]], and [[holly]]. In the Gulf region of the state grow various species of [[Arecaceae|palmetto]] and [[arecaceae|palm]]. In Alabama there are more than 150 [[shrub]]s, including [[kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] and [[rhododendron]]. Among cultivated plants are [[wisteria]] and [[camellia]].\n\nWhile in the past the state enjoyed a variety of mammals such as [[plains bison]], [[eastern elk]], [[North American cougar]], [[bear]], and [[deer]], only the [[white-tailed deer]] remains abundant. Still fairly common are the  [[bobcat]], [[American beaver]], [[muskrat]], [[raccoon]], [[Virginia opossum]], [[rabbit]], [[squirrel]], [[red fox|red]] and [[gray fox]]es, and [[long-tailed weasel]]. [[Coypu]] and [[nine-banded armadillo]] have been introduced to the state and now also common.\n\nAlabama\u2019s birds include [[golden eagle|golden]] and [[bald eagle]]s, [[osprey]] and other [[hawk]]s, [[northern flicker|yellow-shafted flickers]], and [[black-and-white warbler]]s. Game birds include [[bobwhite quail]], [[duck]], [[wild turkey]], and [[goose]]. Freshwater fish such as [[bream]], [[shad]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], and [[Catostomidae|sucker]] are common. Along the Gulf Coast there are seasonal runs of [[tarpon]], [[pompano]], [[red drum]], and [[bonito]].<ref name = \"gale\">{{Citation\n | editor-last = Gall\n | editor-first = Timothy L.\n | title = Worldmark Encyclopedia of the States\n | page = 2\n | isbn = 0-7876-7338-2\n | publisher = Thomson Gale\n | edition = 6\n | year = 2004\n | author = \n | oclc = 53464095\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] lists as [[endangered species|endangered]] 99 animals, fish, and birds, and 18 plant species.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n | title = Threatened & Endangered Species System: Alabama\n | accessdate = 2008-07-27\n | url = http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public//pub/stateListing.jsp?state=AL&status=listed\n}}</ref> The endangered animals include the [[Alabama beach mouse]], [[gray bat]], [[Alabama red-bellied turtle]], [[fin whale|fin]] and [[humpback whale]]s, [[bald eagle]], and [[wood stork]].\n\n[[American black bear]], [[racking horse]], yellow-shafted flicker, wild turkey, [[Atlantic tarpon]], [[largemouth bass]], southern [[longleaf pine]], [[eastern tiger swallowtail]], [[monarch butterfly]], Alabama red-bellied turtle, [[Red Hills salamander]], camellia, [[Hydrangea quercifolia|oak-leaf hydrangea]], [[peach]], [[pecan]], and [[blackberry]] are Alabama's [[List of Alabama state symbols|state symbol]]s.\n\n==Climate and soil==\n{{Main|Climate of Alabama}}\nThe [[climate]] of Alabama is [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]].<ref name=report>[http://nsstc.uah.edu/alclimatereport/ The Alabama Climate Report] Volume1, Number 1 October 2010</ref>\n\nThe heat of summer is tempered in the south by the winds from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and in the north by the elevation above the sea. The average annual temperature is highest in the southwest along the coast, and lowest in the northeast among the highlands. Thus at Mobile the annual mean is {{convert|67|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, the mean for the summer {{convert|81|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, and for the winter {{convert|52|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}; and at Valley Head, in De Kalb county, the annual mean is {{convert|59|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, the mean for the summer {{convert|75|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, and for the winter {{convert|41|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. At Montgomery, in the central region, the average annual temperature is {{convert|66|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, with a winter average of {{convert|49|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, and a summer average of {{convert|81|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. The average winter minimum for the entire state is {{convert|35|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, and there is an average of 35 days in each year in which the thermometer falls below the freezing-point. At extremely rare intervals the thermometer has fallen below zero (-18&nbsp;\u00b0C), as was the case in the remarkable cold wave of the 12th-13 February 1899, when an absolute minimum of {{convert|-17|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} was registered at [[Valley Head, Alabama|Valley Head]]. The highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|109|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in [[Talladega County, Alabama|Talladega]] county in 1902.\n\nThe amount of precipitation is greatest along the coast (62&nbsp;inches/1,574&nbsp;mm) and evenly distributed through the rest of the state (about 52&nbsp;inches/1,320&nbsp;mm). During each winter there is usually one fall of snow in the south and two in the north; but the snow quickly disappears, and sometimes, during an entire winter, the ground is not covered with snow. Heavy snowfall can occur, such as during the [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. [[Hail]]storms occur occasionally in the spring and summer, but are seldom destructive. Heavy [[fog]]s are rare, and are confined chiefly to the coast. [[Thunderstorm]]s occur throughout the year - they are most common in the summer, but most severe in the spring and fall, when destructive winds and [[tornado]]es occasionally occur. The prevailing winds are from the news. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] are quite common in the state, especially in the southern part, and major hurricanes occasionally strike the coast which can be very destructive.\n\nAs regards its soil, Alabama may be divided into four regions. Extending from the Gulf northward for about {{convert|150|mi|km}} is the outer belt of the Coastal Plain, also called the ''Timber Belt,'' whose soil is sandy and poor, but responds well to fertilization. North of this is the inner lowland of the Coastal Plain, or the ''Black Prairie,'' which includes some {{convert|13000|sqmi|km2|-3}} and seventeen counties. It receives its name from its soil (weathered from the weak underlying limestone), which is black in colour, almost destitute of sand and loam, and rich in limestone and marl formations, especially adapted to the production of cotton; hence the region is also called the ''Cotton Belt.'' Between the ''Cotton Belt'' and the [[Tennessee Valley]] is the [[mineral]] region, the ''Old Land'' area\u2014a region of resistant rocks\u2014whose soils, also derived from weathering in silu, are of varied fertility, the best coming from the granites, sandstones and limestones, the poorest from the gneisses, schists and slates. North of the mineral region is the ''Cereal Belt,'' embracing the Tennessee Valley and the counties beyond, whose richest soils are the red clays and dark loams of the river valley; north of which are less fertile soils, produced by siliceous and sandstone formations.\n\n==Wetumpka Meteor Crater==\n{{main|Wetumpka crater}}\n\nWetumpka is the home of \"Alabama's greatest natural disaster.\"<ref name = \"nfqpzf\">[http://www.wetumpkalibrary.com/Default.asp?ID=207 \"Wetumpka Impact Crater\"] Wetumpka Public Library, accessed Aug. 21, 2007.</ref>  A {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2|adj=on}}-wide<ref name = \"nfqpzf\"/> meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago.

Five people have served as acting governor, bringing the total number of people serving as governor to 59, spread over 63 distinct terms. Four governors have served multiple non-consecutive terms: [[Bibb Graves]], [[Jim Folsom]], and [[Fob James]] each served two, and [[George Wallace]] served three non-consecutive periods. Officially, these non-consecutive terms are numbered only with the number of their first term. [[William D. Jelks]] also served non-consecutive terms, but his first term was in an acting capacity.\n\nThe longest-serving governor was George Wallace, who served 16 years over four terms. The shortest term for a non-acting governor was that of [[Hugh McVay]], who served four and a half months after replacing the resigning [[Clement Comer Clay]]. [[Lurleen Wallace]], wife of George Wallace, was the first woman to serve as governor of Alabama, and the third woman to serve as governor of any state. The current governor is Republican [[Kay Ivey]], who took office on April 10, 2017 following Governor [[Robert J.

It seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] on January 11, 1861, and was a founding member of the [[Confederate States of America]] on February 4, 1861. Following the end of the [[American Civil War]], Alabama during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was part of the [[Third Military District]], which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Alabama was readmitted to the Union on July 14, 1868.\n\nThe first [[Alabama Constitution]], ratified in 1819, provided that a governor be elected every two years, limited to serve no more than four out of every six years.<ref>1819 Const. art.

While Catholic tradition considers some of these texts to be [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]], Protestants consider them apocryphal. Thus, Protestant bibles do not include the books within the Old Testament but have often included them in a separate section.

Apocryphal  writings are a class of documents rejected by some as being either pseudepigraphical or unworthy to be properly called Scripture, though, as with other writings, they may sometimes be referenced for support, such as the Book of Jasher. While writings that are now accepted by Christians as Scripture were recognized as being such by various believers early on, the establishment of a largely settled uniform canon was a process of centuries, and what the term \"canon\" (as well as \"apocrypha\") precisely meant also saw development. The canonical process took place with believers recognizing writings as being inspired by God from known or accepted origins, subsequently being followed by official affirmation of what had become largely established through the study and debate of the writings.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> The Roman Catholic church provided its first dogmatic definition of its entire canon in 1546, which put a stop to doubts and disagreements about the status of the Apocrypha, as well as certain other books, which had continued from the beginning of the NT church.<ref>{{cite book|title=New Catholic Encyclopedia|date=2003|publisher=Catholic University of America|location=, Washington, DC 20064|pages=20, 26|edition=Vol. 3}}</ref> The leader of the [[Protestant Reformation]],  [[Martin Luther]], like the Catholic church father [[Jerome]] (and certain others), favored the [[Masoretic]] canon for the Old Testament, excluding apocryphal books in his non-binding canon as unworthy to be properly called Scripture, but included most of them in a separate section, as per Jerome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coogan|first1=Michael David|title=The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical Books .|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|page=457}}</ref> Luther did not include the [[deuterocanonical books]] in his Old Testament, terming them \"Apocrypha, that are books which are not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but are useful and good to read.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC05742122&id=rl3lcbLkHV0C&pg=PA521&lpg=PA521&dq=luther+%22are+useful+and+good+to+read%22|title=The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclop\u00e6dia and Scriptural Dictionary: Fully Defining and Explaining All Religious Terms, Including Biographical, Geographical, Historical, Arch\u00e6ological and Doctrinal Themes, Superbly Illustrated with Over 600 Maps and Engravings|first=Herbert Lockwood|last=Willett|date=21 April 2018|publisher=Howard-Severance Company|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nExplaining the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church's canon is made difficult because of differences of perspective with the [[Roman Catholic]] church in the interpretation of how it was done. Today, Orthodox accept a few more books than appear in the Catholic canon.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Esoteric writings and objects===\nThe word \"apocryphal\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2}}) was first applied{{by whom|date=May 2013}} to writings which were kept secret <ref>{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of the Bible: Volume I (Part I: A -- Cyrus)|last=Hastings|first=James|publisher=The Minerva Group, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=9781410217226|location=|pages=116}}</ref> because they were the vehicles of [[esoteric]] knowledge considered too profound or too sacred to be disclosed to anyone other than the initiated. For example, the [[Apprenticeship|disciples]] of the [[Gnostic]] [[Prodicus]] boasted that they possessed the secret ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03c6\u03b1}}) books of [[Zoroaster]]. The term in general enjoyed high consideration among the [[Gnostics]] (see [[Acts of Thomas]], pp.&nbsp;10, 27, 44).<ref name=EB1911>{{harvnb| Charles|1911}}</ref>\n\nSinologist [[Anna Seidel]] refers to texts and even items produced by ancient Chinese sages as apocryphal and studied their uses during [[Six Dynasties]] China (A.D. 220 to 589).  These artifacts were used as symbols legitimizing and guaranteeing the Emperor's [[Mandate of Heaven|Heavenly Mandate]].  Examples of these include talismans, charts, writs, tallies, and registers.  The first examples were stones, jade pieces, bronze vessels and weapons, but came to include talismans and magic diagrams.<ref name=\"SeidelAnna\">Seidel, Anna. \"Imperial treasures and Taoist sacraments\", in M. Strickmann, ed., Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honor of Rolf A. Stein, II, Bruxelles, Institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises. pp. 291-371.</ref> From their roots in [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era China (1066 to 256 B.C.) these items came to be surpassed in value by texts by the [[Han dynasty]] (206 B.C. to A.D. 220). Most of these texts have been destroyed as Emperors, particularly during the Han dynasty, collected these legitimizing objects and proscribed, forbade and burnt nearly all of them to prevent them from falling into the hands of political rivals.<ref name=\"SeidelAnna\" /> It is therefore fitting with the Greek root of the word, as these texts were obviously hidden away to protect the ruling Emperor from challenges to his status as Heaven's choice as sovereign.\n\n===Writings of questionable value===<!-- This was originally part of the Esoteric writing section, but it does not seem to fit.It seems to be a separate topic-->\n\"Apocrypha\" was also applied to writings that were hidden not because of their divinity but because of their questionable value to the church. Many in [[Protestant]] traditions cite Revelation 22:18\u201319 as a potential curse for those who attach any canonical authority to extra-biblical writings such as the Apocrypha. However, a strict explanation of this text would indicate it was meant for only the [[Book of Revelation]]. Rv.22:18\u201319f. (KJV) states: \"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.\"  In the context of Revelations, a book predicting the future atrocities of man, it means that God will strip them of the goodness of life (\"from the things written in this book\") and that they will be removed from heaven (\"out of the book of life\").   The early Christian theologian [[Origen]], in his ''Commentaries on Matthew'', distinguishes between writings which were read by the churches and apocryphal writings: {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u03bc\u1f74 \u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd \u1f12\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b4' \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f12\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}} (''writing not found on the common and published books in one hand, actually found on the secret ones on the other'').<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1016.htm ''Commentaries on Matthew'', X. 18, XIII. 57]{{Nonspecific|date=March 2010}}</ref> The meaning of \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 is here practically equivalent to \"excluded from the public use of the church\", and prepares the way for an even less favourable use of the word.<ref name=EB1911 />\n\n===Spurious writings===\nIn general use, the word \"apocrypha\" came to mean \"false, spurious, bad, or heretical.\" This meaning also appears in Origen's prologue to his commentary on the [[Song of Songs]], of which only the [[Latin]] translation survives: ''De scripturis his, quae appellantur apocriphae, pro eo quod multa in iis corrupta et contra fidem veram inveniuntur a maioribus tradita non placuit iis dari locum nec admitti ad auctoritatem.''<ref name=EB1911 /> \"Concerning these scriptures, which are called apocryphal, for the reason that many things are found in them corrupt and against the true faith handed down by the elders, it has pleased them that they not be given a place nor be admitted to authority.\"\n\n===Other===\nOther uses of ''apocrypha'' developed over the history of Western Christianity.  The [[Gelasian Decree]] (generally held now as being  the work of an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553) refers to religious works by [[church fathers]] [[Eusebius]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] as apocrypha. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] defined the word as meaning simply \"obscurity of origin,\" implying that any book of unknown authorship or questionable authenticity would be considered apocryphal. On the other hand, [[Jerome]] (in ''Protogus Galeatus'') declared that all books outside the Hebrew canon were apocryphal. In practice, Jerome treated some books outside the Hebrew canon as if they were canonical, and the Western Church did not accept Jerome's definition of apocrypha, instead retaining the word's prior meaning (''see: [[Deuterocanon]]'').<ref name=EB1911 /> As a result, various church authorities labeled different books as apocrypha, treating them with varying levels of regard.\n \n[[Origen]] (who stated that \"the canonical books, as the Hebrews have handed them down, are twenty-two\"),<ref>{{cite web|title=Origen on the Canon|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/origen.html|website=BibleResearcher.com|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] and others cited some apocryphal books as \"scripture,\" \"divine scripture,\" \"inspired,\" and the like. On the other hand, teachers connected with [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and familiar with the [[protocanonical books|Hebrew canon]] excluded from the canon all of the Old Testament not found there. This view is reflected in the canon of [[Melito of Sardis]], and in the prefaces and letters of Jerome. A third view was that the books were not as valuable as the canonical scriptures of the [[Hebrew]] collection, but were of value for moral uses, as introductory texts for new converts from [[paganism]], and to be read in congregations. They were referred to as \"[[ecclesiastical]]\" works by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]].<ref name=EB1911 />\n\nThese three opinions regarding the apocryphal books prevailed until the [[Protestant Reformation]], when the idea of what constitutes canon became a matter of primary concern for [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s alike. In 1546 the Catholic [[Council of Trent]] reconfirmed the canon of Augustine, dating to the second and third centuries, declaring \"He is also to be anathema who does not receive these entire books, with all their parts, as they have been accustomed to be read in the Catholic Church, and are found in the ancient editions of the Latin [[Vulgate]], as sacred and canonical.\" The whole of the books in question, with the exception of [[1 Esdras]] and [[2 Esdras]] and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], were declared canonical at Trent.<ref name=EB1911 /> The Protestants, in comparison,  were diverse in their opinion of the deuterocanon early on. Some considered them divinely inspired, others rejected them. Anglicans took a position between the Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches; they kept them as Christian intertestamental readings and a part of the Bible, but no doctrine should be based on them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} [[John Wycliffe]], a 14th-century Christian Humanist, had declared in his biblical translation that \"whatever book is in the Old Testament besides these twenty-five shall be set among the apocrypha, that is, without authority or belief.\"<ref name=EB1911 /> Nevertheless, his translation of the Bible included the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] and the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans|Epistle of the Laodiceans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/wycliffe/|title=John Wycliffe's Translation|work=nnu.edu}}</ref>\n\nMartin Luther did not class apocryphal books as being Scripture, but in both the [[Luther Bible|German]] (1534) translation of the Bible, the apocrypha are published in a separate section from the other books, although the Lutheran and Anglican lists are different. In some editions (like the Westminster), readers were warned that these books were not \"to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.\" A milder distinction was expressed elsewhere, such as in the \"argument\" introducing them in the [[Geneva Bible]], and in the Sixth Article of the [[Church of England]], where it is said that \"the other books the church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners,\" though not to establish doctrine.<ref name=EB1911 />  Among some other Protestants,  the term ''apocryphal'' began to take on extra or altered connotations: not just of dubious authenticity, but having spurious or false content,<ref name=\"McDonald\" /> not just obscure but having hidden or suspect motives.{{citation needed|reason=needs published reference|date=November 2015}}  Protestants were (and are) not unanimous in adopting those meanings.

[[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] sometimes avoid using the term in contexts where it might be disputatious or be misconstrued as yielding on the point of canonicity.  Thus the respect accorded to apocryphal books varied between Protestant denominations. Most Protestant published Bibles that include the apocryphal books will relocate them into a separate section (rather like an appendix), so as not to intermingle them with their canonical books.\n\nAccording to the [[Orthodox Anglican Church]]:\n\n{{quote|On the other hand, the Anglican Communion emphatically maintains that the Apocrypha is part of the Bible and is to be read with respect by her members.

One of the offertory sentences in Holy Communion comes from an apocryphal book (Tob. 4: 8\u20139).

Catholic Christians incorporated several of these books into the canon of the Christian Bible, calling them the \"apocrypha\" or the \"hidden books\" of the Bible. Patristic authorities frequently recognized these books as important to the emergence of apostolic Christianity, but the inspired authority and value of the apocrypha remained widely disputed. In the sixteenth century, during the Protestant reformation, some authorities began using term ''deuterocanonical'' to refer to this traditional intertestamental collection as books of \"the second canon.\" <ref>The ''Style Manual for the Society of Biblical Literature'' recommends the use of the term ''deuterocanonical literature'' instead of ''apocrypha'' in academic writing, although not all apocryphal books are properly deuterocanonical.</ref> These books are often seen as \"intertestamental\" because reading them helps explain the theological and cultural transitions which took place between the Old and New Testaments. They are also sometimes called \"intertestamental\" by religious groups who do not recognize Hellenistic Judaism as belonging with either \"Jewish\" or \"Christian\" testaments.\n\nSlightly varying collections of apocryphal, deuterocanonical, or intertestamental books of the Bible form part of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]] canons (cf [[Development of the Old Testament canon]]). The deuterocanonical or intertestamental books of the Catholic Church include 1-2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, the Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, the Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, the Prayer of Manasseh, and 1-2 Maccabees.\n\nThe [[Book of Enoch]] is included in the biblical canon of the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches of Ethiopia and Eritrea.  The [[Epistle of Jude]] quotes the book of Enoch, and some believe the use of this book also appears in the four gospels and [[1 Peter]].<ref>Clontz, T.E. and J., \"The Comprehensive New Testament\", Cornerstone Publications (2008), {{ISBN|978-0-9778737-1-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accordancebible.com/Comprehensive-Crossreferences|title=New Release: Comprehensive Bible Cross References|first=Accordance Bible|last=Software|date=|website=Accordance Bible Software|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref> The genuineness and inspiration of Enoch were believed in by the writer of the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]]<ref name=EB1911 /> and much of the early church. The epistles of Paul and the gospels also show influences from the [[Book of Jubilees]], which is part of the Ethiopian canon, as well as the [[Assumption of Moses]] and the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]], which are included in no biblical canon.\n\nThe canonical validity of the intertestamental books was challenged in the 16th century by Protestants. The Protestant removal of the deuterocanonical books of the Bible did not happen immediately as part of the Reformation, but rather happened in waves over time. The apocryphal books were in fact translated as part of the King James Version of the Bible. Eventually they were effectively removed by Protestants during the 1800s, with some Protestants arguing against their inclusion for theological reasons, and with other Protestants citing the cost of publishing the hidden books as a major factor in removing them. Today it is possible to find Protestant Bibles which now include the Apocrypha. The status of the deuterocanonicals remains unchanged in Catholic and Orthodox Christianities.\n\n===Christianity===\n\n====Disputes over canonicity====\nThe actual status of the books which the Catholic church terms ''Deuterocanonicals'' (second canon) and Protestantism refers to as ''Apocrypha'' has been an issue of disagreement which preceded the Reformation. Many believe that the pre-Christian-era Jewish translation (into Greek) of holy scriptures known as the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures originally compiled around 280 B.C., originally included the apocryphal writings in dispute, with little distinction made between them and the rest of the [[Old Testament]].

In response to this challenge, after the death of Martin Luther (February 8, 1546)  the ecumenical [[Council of Trent]] officially (\"infallibly\") declared these books (called \"deuterocanonical\" by Catholics) to be part of the canon in  April, 1546 A.D.

Protestants also rejected the Catholic term \"deuterocanonical\" for these writings, preferring to apply the term \"apocryphal\" which was already in use for other early and disputed writings. As today (but along with others reasons),<ref name=\"Wegner\"/>  various reformers argued that those books contained doctrinal or other errors and thus should not have been added to the canon for that reason. The differences between canons can be seen under [[Biblical canon#Old Testament|Biblical canon]] and [[Development of the Christian biblical canon]].  \n \nExplaining the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church's canon is made difficult because of differences of perspective with the [[Roman Catholic]] church in the interpretation of how it was done.  Those differences (in matters of jurisdictional authority) were contributing factors in the [[East-West Schism|separation of the Roman Catholics and Orthodox]] around 1054, but the formation of the canon which Trent would later officially definitively settle was largely complete by the fifth century, in not settled, six centuries before the separation.  In the eastern part of the church, it took much of the fifth century also to come to agreement, but in the end it was accomplished.  The canonical books thus established by the undivided church became the predominate canon for what was later to become Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox alike.  The East did already differ from the West in not considering every question of canon yet settled, and it subsequently adopted a few more books into its Old Testament.  It also allowed consideration of yet a few more to continue not fully decided, which led in some cases to adoption in one or more jurisdictions, but not all.  Thus, there are today a few remaining differences of canon among Orthodox, and all Orthodox accept a few more books than appear in the Catholic canon. The [[Psalms of Solomon]],  [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]], the [[Epistle of Jeremiah]]  the [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Book of Odes]], the  [[Prayer of Manasseh]] and [[Psalm 151]] are included in some copies of the Septuagint,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Old Testament Canon and Apocrypha|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/canon2.html|website=BibleResearcher|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref> some of which are accepted as canonical by Eastern Orthodox and some other churches.   Protestants accept none of these additional books as canon either, but see them having roughly the same status as the other Apocrypha.\n\n====New Testament apocrypha====\n{{Main|New Testament apocrypha}}\nNew Testament apocrypha\u2014books similar to those in the [[New Testament]] but almost universally rejected by Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants\u2014include several gospels and lives of apostles. Some were written by early Jewish Christians (see the [[Gospel according to the Hebrews]]). Others of these were produced by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] authors or members of other groups later defined as [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]]. Many texts believed lost for centuries were unearthed in the 19th and 20th centuries, producing lively speculation about their importance in early [[Christianity]] among religious scholars,{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} while many others survive only in the form of quotations from them in other writings; for some, no more than the title is known. Artists and theologians have drawn upon the New Testament apocrypha for such matters as the names of [[Dismas]] and [[Gestas]] and details about the [[Three Wise Men]]. The first explicit mention of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is found in the [[pseudepigraphical]] [[Infancy Gospel of James]].\n\nBefore the fifth century, the Christian writings that were then under discussion for inclusion in the canon but had not yet been accepted were classified in a group known as the ancient [[antilegomena]]e.  These were all candidates for the New Testament and included several books which were eventually accepted, such as: [[The Epistle to the Hebrews]], [[2 Peter]], [[3 John]] and the [[Revelation of John]] (Apocalypse).  None of those accepted books can be considered Apocryphal now, since all Christendom accepts them as canonical.  Of the uncanonized ones, the Early Church considered some heretical but viewed others quite well.  Some Christians, in an extension of the meaning, might also consider the non-heretical books to be \"apocryphal\" along the manner of Martin Luther: not canon, but useful to read.  This category includes books such as the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], the [[Didache]], and [[The Shepherd of Hermas]] which are sometimes referred to as the [[Apostolic Fathers]].\nThe [[Gnosticism|Gnostic tradition]] was a prolific source of apocryphal gospels.<ref name=EB1911 /> While these writings borrowed the characteristic poetic features of apocalyptic literature from Judaism, Gnostic sects largely insisted on allegorical interpretations based on a secret apostolic tradition. With them, these apocryphal books were highly esteemed. A well-known Gnostic apocryphal book is the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the only complete text of which was found in the Egyptian town of [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945. The [[Gospel of Judas]], a Gnostic gospel, also received much media attention when it was reconstructed in 2006.\n\nRoman Catholics and Orthodox Christians as well as Protestants generally agree on the canon of the [[New Testament]], see [[Development of the New Testament canon]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] have in the past also included [[Epistles of Clement (disambiguation)|I & II Clement]] and [[Shepherd of Hermas]] in their [[New Testament]] canon.\n\n====List of Sixty====\nThe List of Sixty, dating to around the 7th century, lists the sixty books of the Bible.

Emerging from the instability of the [[Warring States period]] (476\u2013221 BCE), ancient Chinese scholars saw the centralized rule of the Zhou as an ideal model for the new Han empire to emulate. The ''Ch'an-wei'' are therefore texts written by Han scholars about the Zhou royal treasures, only they were not written to record history for its own sake, but for legitimizing the current imperial reign. These texts took the form of stories about texts and objects being conferred upon the Emperors by Heaven and comprising these ancient sage-king's (this is how the Zhou emperors were referred to by this time, about 500 years after their peak) royal regalia.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The desired effect was to confirm the Han emperor's [[Mandate of Heaven|Heavenly Mandate]] through the continuity offered by his possession of these same sacred talismans. It is because of this politicized recording of their history that it is difficult to retrace the exact origins of these objects. What is known is that these texts were most likely produced by a class of literati called the ''[[fangshi]]''.

Jan Huber (Netherlands) served as the first Executive Secretary for five years until August 31, 2009. He was succeeded on September 1, 2009, by Manfred Reinke (Germany).\n\nThe tasks of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat can be divided into the following areas:\n* Supporting the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) and the meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP).\n* Facilitating the exchange of information between the Parties required in the Treaty and the Environment Protocol.\n* Collecting, storing, arranging and publishing the documents of the ATCM.\n* Providing and disseminating public information about the Antarctic Treaty system and Antarctic activities.\n\n==Legal system==\nAntarctica currently has no permanent population and therefore it has no citizenship nor government. All personnel present on Antarctica at any time are citizens or nationals of some sovereignty outside Antarctica, as there is no Antarctic sovereignty. The majority of Antarctica is claimed by one or more countries, but most countries do not explicitly recognize those claims. The area on the mainland between [[90th meridian west|90 degrees west]] and [[150th meridian west|150 degrees west]] is the only major land on Earth not claimed by any country.<ref>Wright, Minturn, \"The Ownership of Antarctica, Its Living and Mineral Resources\", ''Journal of Law and the Environment'' 4 (1987).</ref> Until 2015 the interior of the Norwegian Sector, the extent of which had never been officially defined,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dronning Maud Land|url=http://www.npolar.no/en/the-antarctic/dronning-maud-land.html|website=Norwegian Polar Institute|accessdate=22 September 2015}}</ref> was considered to be unclaimed.

These laws generally apply only to their own citizens, wherever they are in Antarctica, and serve to enforce the consensus decisions of the consultative parties: about which activities are acceptable, which areas require permits to enter, what processes of environmental impact assessment must precede activities, and so on. The Antarctic Treaty is often considered to represent an example of the [[common heritage of mankind]] principle.<ref>Jennifer Frakes, The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise?

In terms of criminal law, the laws that apply to the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] (which follows the laws of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]) apply to the Australian Antarctic Territory. Key Australian legislation applying Antarctic Treaty System decisions include the ''Antarctic Treaty Act 1960'', the ''Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980'' and the ''Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981''.<ref>[http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=3358 Australian Antarctic Division \u2013 Australian environmental law and guidelines<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe [[law of the United States]], including certain criminal offences by or against U.S. nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other countries. To this end, the United States now stations special deputy [[United States Marshal|U.S. Marshals]] in Antarctica to provide a law enforcement presence.<ref>[http://www.usmarshals.gov/history/antarctica/ Marshals and Antarctica<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSome U.S. laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]], Public Law 95-541, {{UnitedStatesCode|16|2401}} ''et seq.'', provides civil and criminal penalties for the following activities, unless authorized by regulation or [[statute]]:\n* the taking of native Antarctic mammals or birds\n* the introduction into Antarctica of non-indigenous plants and animals\n* entry into specially protected or scientific areas\n* the discharge or disposal of pollutants into Antarctica or Antarctic waters\n* the importation into the U.S. of certain items from Antarctica\n\nViolation of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to US$10,000 in fines and one year in prison. The Departments of [[United States Department of the Treasury|the Treasury]], [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]], [[United States Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and [[United States Department of the Interior|the Interior]] share enforcement responsibilities. The Act requires expeditions from the U.S. to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the [[Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs]] of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], which reports such plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty. Further information is provided by the [[Office of Polar Programs]] of the [[National Science Foundation]].\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn 2006, the New Zealand police reported that jurisdictional issues prevented them issuing warrants for potential American witnesses who were reluctant to testify during the [[Christchurch]] Coroner's investigation into the death by poisoning of Australian astrophysicist [[Rodney Marks (astrophysicist)|Rodney Marks]] at the [[South Pole]] base in May 2000.<ref name=\"stuffSunday\">Hotere, Andrea.

However, an autopsy in New Zealand revealed that Dr. Marks died from [[methanol]] poisoning. The [[New Zealand Police]] launched an investigation. In 2006, frustrated by lack of progress, the Christchurch Coroner said that it was unlikely that Dr. Marks ingested the methanol knowingly, although there is no certainty that he died as the direct result of the act of another person. During media interviews, the police detective in charge of the investigation criticized the National Science Foundation and contractor [[Raytheon]] for failing to co-operate with the investigation.<ref name=\"TelegraphChapman\">Chapman, Paul.

He later managed in the minors from 1905 to 1907.\n\n===Union Professional League===\nIn 1908 he started a new professional baseball league known as the [[Union Professional League]]. The league took the field in April but folded one month later owing to financial difficulties.<ref name=DC>{{cite news |last=Wagner |first=William |title=D.C.

It sold for 10 cents a copy from newsstands across the country. In 1910, moving to New York City, he renamed the magazine \"Aircraft\" and published it until 1914. The magazine chronicled the technical developments of the early aviation pioneers. He was the first advocate for commercial air travel, coining the term \"airline.\" He also advocated for a strong American flying force, lobbying Congress in 1913 to expand its appropriations for Army aircraft.\n\nIn early 1913, he learned to fly the Sloan-Deperdussin and the [[Bl\u00e9riot XI|Moisant-Bleriot]] monoplanes, becoming an accomplished pilot. Later that year he bought a Thomas flying boat and became the first air commuter regularly flying from his country house in Seidler's Beach NJ to the foot of 75th Street in NYC (about 35 miles). In 1917, utilizing the knowledge gained from 10 years advocating aviation, he built his first airplane, the Lawson Military Tractor 1 (MT-1) trainer, and founded the Lawson Aircraft Corporation. The company's plant was sited at Green Bay, Wisconsin. There he secured a contract and built the Lawson MT-2. He also designed the steel fuselage Lawson Armored Battler, which never got beyond the drafting board, given doubts within the Army aviation community and the signing of the armistice.\n\n[[File:Lawson T-2.jpg|left|thumb|Lawson C.2 or T-2]]\nAfter the war, in 1919 Lawson started a project to build America's first airline. He secured financial backing, and in five months he had built and demonstrated in flight his biplane airliner, the 18-passenger [[Lawson L-2]]. He demonstrated its capabilities in a 2000-mile multi-city tour from Milwaukee to Chicago-Toledo-Cleveland-Buffalo-Syracuse-New york City-Washington, D.C.-Collinsville-Dayton-Chicago and back to Milwaukee, creating a buzz of positive press.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alfred|first=Lawson|title=200 Mile Trip in First Airliner|year=1928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bb1BAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA146&ots=LLFq3DGaME&dq=%222000%20mile%20trip%20in%20first%22%20alfred%20lawson&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q=%222000%20mile%20trip%20in%20first%22%20alfred%20lawson&f=false}}</ref>  The publicity allowed him to secure an additional $1 million to build the 26-passenger [[Lawson L-4|Midnight Liner]]. The aircraft crashed on takeoff on its maiden flight. In late 1920, he secured government contracts for three airmail routes and to deliver 10 war planes, but owing to the fall 1920 recession, he could not secure the necessary $100,000 in cash reserves called for in the contracts and had to decline them. In 1926 he started his last airliner, the 56-seat, two-tier Lawson super airliner.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lawson \u2013 Aircraft Industry Builder|year=1930|publisher=Humanity publishing company}}</ref>\nIn this phase of his life, he was considered one of the leading thinkers in the budding American commercial aviation community, but his troubles with getting financial backing for his ideas led him to turn to economics, philosophy, and organization.\n\n==Lawsonomy (1929\u20131954)==\nIn the 1920s, he promoted health practices, including [[vegetarianism]], and claimed to have found the secret of living to 200. He also developed his own highly unusual theories of physics, according to which such concepts as \"penetrability\", \"suction and pressure\" and \"zig-zag-and-swirl\" were discoveries on par with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]].<ref>{{cite book | title = [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] | author = Martin Gardner  | pages = 69\u201379 | isbn = 978-0-486-20394-2 | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1957}}</ref> He published numerous books on these concepts, all set in a distinctive typography. Lawson repeatedly predicted the worldwide adoption of Lawsonian principles by the year 2000.\n\nHe later propounded his own philosophy, Lawsonomy, and the [[Lawsonian religion]]. He also developed, during the [[Great Depression]], the [[Populism|populist]] economic theory of \"[[Direct Credit]]s\", according to which banks are the cause of all economic woes, the oppressors of both capital and labour. Lawson believed that the government should replace banks as the provider of loans to business and workers. His rallies and lectures attracted thousands of listeners in the early 1930s, mainly in the upper Midwest, but by the late 1930s the crowds had dwindled.\n\nIn 1943, he founded the [[University of Lawsonomy]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] to spread his teachings and offer the degree of \"Knowledgian\", but after various IRS and other investigations it was closed and finally sold in 1954, the year of Lawson's death. Lawson's financial arrangements remain mysterious to this day, and in later years he seems to have owned little property, moving from city to city as a guest of his farflung acolytes. In 1952, he was brought before a [[United States Senate]] investigative committee on allegations that his organization had bought war surplus machines and then sold them for a profit, despite claiming [[non-profit]] status. His attempt to explain Lawsonomy to the senators ended in mutual frustration and bafflement.<ref>''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science'', p. 77</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816203,00.html | work=Time | title=Education: Zigzag & Swirl | date=March 24, 1952}}</ref>\n\nA farm near [[Racine, Wisconsin]], is the only remaining university facility, although a tiny handful of churches may yet survive in places such as [[Wichita, Kansas]]. The large sign, formerly reading \"University of Lawsonomy\", was a familiar landmark for motorists in the region for many years and was visible from [[Interstate 94]] about {{convert|13|mi|km}} north of the [[Illinois]] state line, on the east side of the highway. Although the sign still exists, the \"of\" has now been replaced by the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of the Lawsonomy website. A storm in the spring of 2009 destroyed the sign, although the supporting posts are still visible. On the northbound side of Interstate 94, a sign on the roof of the building nearest the freeway said \"Study Natural Law\" until being shingled over in October 2014.\n\n==Personal==\nLawson's brother, George H. Lawson, founded the [[United States Baseball League|United States League]] in 1910. The new professional baseball league had the intent to racially integrate. The league lasted less than a season, but it was revived for one season by George Lawson's associates in 1912.<ref name=George>{{cite news|last=Kuntz|first=Jerry|title=George H.

The [[Iowa State Cyclones]] play in the [[NCAA]]'s Division I-A as a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]].\n\n== Media ==\n;Online and newsprint\n*[[Ames Tribune]], Tuesday-Sunday paper produced in Ames.\n*[[Iowa State Daily]], independent student newspaper produced at Iowa State University.\n*[[The Des Moines Register]] also provides extensive coverage of Iowa news and sports to Ames.\n*[http://storycountysun.com/ Story County Sun], weekly newspaper that covers the entire county published in Ames.\n;Radio stations licensed to Ames\n*[[KURE]], student radio operated at Iowa State University.\n*[[WOI-FM]], [[Iowa Public Radio]]'s flagship \"Studio One\" station, broadcasting an [[NPR]] news format during the day and a music format in the evening, owned and operated at Iowa State University.\n*[[WOI (AM)]], Iowa Public Radio's flagship station delivering a 24-hour news format consisting mainly of NPR programming, owned and operated at Iowa State University.\n*[[KMYR]], [[Adult Contemporary]] station licensed to Ames, but operated in Des Moines.\n*[[KCYZ]], [[Hot Adult Contemporary]] station owned and operated by Clear Channel in Ames.\n*[[KASI]], news/talk station owned and operated by Clear Channel in Ames.\n*[[KHOI (FM)|KHOI]], [[Community radio|Community Radio]] station licensed to [[Story City, Iowa|Story City]] with studios in Ames. KHOI broadcasts music and local public affairs programs and is affiliated with the [[Pacifica Radio]] network.\nAmes is also served by stations in the Des Moines media market, which includes [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel's]] 50,000-watt talk station [[WHO (AM)|WHO]], music stations [[KAZR]], [[KDRB]], [[KGGO]], [[KKDM]], [[KDXA]], [[KHKI]], [[KIOA]], [[KJJY]], [[KRNT]], [[KSPZ]] and [[KSTZ]], talk station [[KWQW]], and sports station [[KXNO]], \n;Television\nLike radio, Ames is served by the Des Moines media market. [[WOI-DT]], the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate in central Iowa, was originally owned and operated by Iowa State University until the 1990s. The station is still licensed to Ames, but studio's are located in [[West Des Moines]]. Other stations serving Ames include [[KCCI]], [[KDIN-TV]], [[WHO-DT]], [[KCWI-TV]], [[KDMI]], [[KDSM-TV]] and [[KFPX]].\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n[[File:Power plant in Ames.jpg|thumb|right|upright|City power plant at night blows steam into the air]]\n=== Transportation ===\n\nThe town is served by [[U.S. Route 30|U.S. Highways 30]] and [[U.S. Route 69|69]] and [[Interstate 35]]. Ames is the only town in Iowa with a population of greater than 50,000 that does not have a state highway serving it.  {{As of|2015}}, Ames does not have any [[roundabout]]s, though a project to create three roundabouts is planned.<ref>{{cite news|title=University Boulevard plans include Ames' first roundabouts|last=Erickson|first=Melissa|newspaper=[[Ames Tribune]]|pages=A1, A4|date=January 14, 2015|volume=147|number=170}}</ref>\n\nAmes was serviced by the Fort Dodge, Des Moines and Southern Railroad via a branch from [[Kelley, Iowa|Kelley]] to Iowa State University and to downtown Ames. The tracks were removed in the 1960s. The [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]] twin mainline runs east and west bisecting the town and running just south of the downtown business district. The [[C&NW]] used to operate a branch to [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]. This line was removed in the 1980s when the Spine Line through [[Nevada, Iowa|Nevada]] was purchased from the [[Rock Island Railroad]] after its bankruptcy. The [[Union Pacific]], successor to the C&NW, still runs 60\u201370 trains a day through Ames on twin mainlines, which leads to some traffic delays. There is also a branch to [[Eagle Grove, Iowa|Eagle Grove]] that leaves Ames to the north. The Union Pacific maintains a small yard called Ames Yard east of Ames between Ames and Nevada. Ames has been testing automatic train horns at several of its crossings. These directional horns which are focused down the streets are activated when the crossing signals turn on and are shut off after the train crosses the crossing. This system cancels out the need for the trains to blow their horns. Train noise had been a problem in the residential areas to the west and northwest of downtown.\n\n[[Ames Municipal Airport]] is located {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} southeast of the city. The current (and only) [[Fixed-Base Operation|FBO]] is Hap's Air Service, a company which has been based at the airport since 1975. The airport has two runways \u2013 01/19, which is {{convert|5700|x|100|ft}}, and 13/31, which is {{convert|3492|x|100|ft}}.\n\nThe City of Ames offers a transit system throughout town, called [[CyRide]], that is funded jointly by Iowa State University, the ISU Government of the Student Body, and the City of Ames. Rider fares are subsidized through this funding, and are free for children under five. Students pay a set cost as part of their tuition.\n\nIn 2009, the Ames metropolitan statistical area (MSA) ranked as the third highest in the United States for percentage of commuters who walked to work (10.4 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-15.pdf|series=American Community Survey Reports|title=Commuting in the United States: 2009|access-date=December 26, 2017|date=September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726134351/https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-15.pdf|archive-date=July 26, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAmes has the headquarters of the [[Iowa Department of Transportation]].<ref>\"[http://www.iowadot.gov/where.htm Where We Are Located] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728084104/http://www.iowadot.gov/where.htm |date=July 28, 2009 }}.\" [[Iowa Department of Transportation]].

Because Iowa is the first caucus state and Ames is a [[college town]], it is the site of many political appearances, debates and events, especially during election years.\n\nFrom 1979 through 2011, Ames was the location of the [[Ames Straw Poll]], which was held every August prior to a presidential election year in which the Republican presidential nomination was undecided (meaning there was no Republican president running for re-election\u2014as in 2011, 2007, 1999, 1995, 1987, and 1979). The poll would gauge support for the various Republican candidates amongst attendees of a [[fundraising]] dinner benefiting the [[Republican Party of Iowa|Iowa Republican Party]]. The straw poll was frequently seen by national media and party insiders as a first test of organizational strength in Iowa.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/14/iowa.saturday.02/|title=Iowa Saturday|publisher=CNN|date=August 14, 1999}}</ref> In 2015, the straw poll was to be moved to nearby Boone before the Iowa Republican Party eventually decided to cancel it altogether.<ref>{{cite new|url = http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/06/12/iowa-straw-poll/71116276/|title=The Iowa Straw Poll is dead|publisher=The Des Moines Register|date=June 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Iowa}}\n* [[Ames process]]\n* [[North Grand Mall]]\n* [[Reiman Gardens]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Ames, Iowa}}\n{{wikivoyage|Ames}}\n*[http://www.cityofames.org/ Official Ames City Website]\n* [http://www.amescampustown.com/ Ames Campustown official site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060210213426/http://www.mainstreetculturaldistrict.com/ The Main Street Cultural District]\n*[http://www.city-data.com/city/Ames-Iowa.html City Data] Detailed Statistical Data and more about Ames\n\n<br/><!--this break is to put visual space between links and the following template-->\n{{Story County, Iowa}}\n\n[[Category:Ames, Iowa| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Iowa]]\n[[Category:Cities in Story County, Iowa]]\n[[Category:University towns in the United States]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1864]]\n[[Category:1864 establishments in Iowa]]", "sha1": "lg4nq7rc4necgn4ipr6gxfp9811x6mm"}}, {"title": "Abbadides", "ns": "0", "id": "1299", "redirect": {"title": "Abbadid dynasty"}, "revision": {"id": "504162143", "parentid": "15899788", "timestamp": "2012-07-25T20:09:53Z", "contributor": {"username": "AvicBot", "id": "11952314"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot: Fixing double redirect to [[Abbadid dynasty]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Abbadid dynasty]]", "sha1": "idnsnoiyc7wr7dyz4io3sbsne83lw9v"}}, {"title": "Abalone", "ns": "0", "id": "1300", "revision": {"id": "866258295", "parentid": "866239759", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T08:02:26Z", "contributor": {"username": "WolfmanSF", "id": "1866741"}, "minor": "", "comment": "clean up", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|human uses of abelone|the genus|Haliotis|other uses||the wine grape known as Abelone|Chasselas}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{Taxobox\n| fossil range = {{Fossil range | Late Cretaceous | Recent | ref=<ref name=\"Geiger1999\">{{harvnb|Geiger|Groves|1999|p=872}}</ref> }}\n| name               = Abalone\n| image              = LivingAbalone.JPG\n| image_caption      = Living abalone in tank showing epipodium and tentacles, anterior end to the right.\n| regnum             = [[Animal]]ia\n| phylum             = [[Mollusc]]a\n| classis            = [[Gastropod]]a\n| subclassis         = [[Vetigastropoda]]\n| superfamilia       = [[Haliotoidea]]\n| familia            = [[Haliotidae]]\n| familia_authority  = [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque|Rafinesque]], 1815\n| genus              = ''[[Haliotis]]''\n| genus_authority    = [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], 1758<ref>{{harvnb|Linnaeus|1758|p=779}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Linnaeus|1767|p=1255}}</ref>\n| type_species_authority = [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], 1758\n| subdivision_ranks  = Species\n| subdivision        = 57, see [[#Species|species section]].\n| synonyms_ref       = <ref name=\"WoRMS\">{{harvnb|Gofas|Tran|Bouchet|2014}}</ref>\n| synonyms           =\n* ''Euhaliotis'' <small>[[Wilhelm August Wenz|Wenz]], 1938</small>\n* ''Eurotis'' <small>Habe & Kosuge, 1964</small>\n* ''Exohaliotis'' <small>[[Bernard Charles Cotton|Cotton]] & Godfrey, 1933</small>\n* ''Haliotis (Haliotis)'' <small>[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], 1758</small>\n* ''Haliotis (Nordotis)'' <small>Habe & Kosuge, 1964</small>\n* ''Haliotis (Notohaliotis)'' <small>[[Bernard Charles Cotton|Cotton]] & Godfrey, 1933</small>\n* ''Haliotis (Padollus)'' <small>[[Pierre Denys de Montfort|Montfort]], 1810</small>\n* ''Haliotis (Paua)'' <small>[[Charles Fleming (ornithologist)|C.

Their taxonomy puts them in the family Haliotidae which contains only one genus, ''[[Haliotis]]'', which once contained six subgenera. These subgenera have become alternate representations of ''Haliotis''.<ref name=\"WoRMS\" /> The number of species recognized worldwide ranges between 30<ref name=DCMD>{{harvnb|Dauphin|Cuif|Mutvei|Denis|1989|p=9}}</ref> and 130<ref name=Cox>{{harvnb|Cox|1962|p=8}}</ref> with over 230 species-level taxa described. The most comprehensive treatment of the family considers 56 species valid, with 18 additional subspecies.<ref name=GO>{{harvnb|Geiger|Owen|2012}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[gastropod shell|shells]] of abalones have a low, open spiral structure, and are characterized by several open respiratory pores in a row near the shell's outer edge. The thick inner layer of the shell is composed of [[nacre]] (mother-of-pearl), which in many species is highly [[Iridescence|iridescent]], giving rise to a range of strong, changeable colors, which make the shells attractive to humans as decorative objects, jewelry, and as a source of colorful [[mother-of-pearl]].\n\nThe flesh of abalones is widely considered to be a desirable food, and is consumed raw or cooked by a variety of cultures.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:AbaloneInside.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Iridescence|iridescent]] surface inside a [[red abalone]] shell from [[Northern California]] (the adjacent coin is 25 mm in diameter)]]\n\nAbalone vary in size from {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} (''[[Haliotis pulcherrima]]'') to {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} while ''[[Haliotis rufescens]]'' is the largest of the genus at {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoiberg|1993|p=7}}</ref>\n\nThe shell of abalones is [[wikt:convex|convex]], rounded to oval in shape, and may be highly arched or very flattened. The shell of the majority of species has a small, flat [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]] and two to three [[Whorl (mollusc)|whorls]]. The last whorl, known as the [[body whorl]], is [[wikt:auriform|auriform]], meaning that the shell resembles an ear, giving rise to the common name \"ear shell\". ''[[Haliotis asinina]]'' has a somewhat different shape, as it is more elongated and distended. The shell of ''Haliotis cracherodii cracherodii'' is also unusual as it has an [[wikt:ovate|ovate]] form, is [[wikt:imperforate|imperforate]], shows an [[wikt:exsert|exserted]] spire, and has prickly ribs.\n\nA [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] cleft in the shell impresses a groove in the shell, in which are the row of holes characteristic of the genus. These holes are respiratory apertures for venting water from the gills and for releasing sperm and eggs into the water column. They make up what is known as the [[selenizone]] which forms as the shell grows. This series of eight to 38 holes is near the anterior margin. Only a small number is generally open. The older holes are gradually sealed up as the shell grows and new holes form. Each species has a typical number of open holes, between four and 10, in the selenizone. An abalone has no [[Operculum (gastropod)|operculum]]. The [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] of the shell is very wide and [[wikt:nacreous|nacreous]].\n\nThe exterior of the shell is striated and dull. The color of the shell is very variable from species to species which may reflect the animal's diet.<ref name=MtSS /> The iridescent [[nacre]] that lines the inside of the shell varies in color from silvery white, to pink, red and green-red to deep blue, green to purple.\n\nThe animal has [[wikt:fimbriated|fimbriated]] head lobes and side lobes which are fimbriated and [[Cirrus (biology)|cirrated]]. The [[radula]] has small median teeth, and the lateral teeth are single and beam-like. They have about 70 [[uncini]], with [[wikt:denticulated|denticulated]] hooks, the first four very large. The rounded foot is very large in comparison to most molluscs. The soft body is coiled around the [[Columella (gastropod)|columellar muscle]], and its insertion, instead of being on the columella, is on the middle of the inner wall of the shell.

The state is sectioned into three fishing zones, Eastern, Central and Western, with each fisher required a zone-allocated licence. Harvesting is performed by divers using surface-supplied air \"hookah\" systems operating from runabout-style, outboard-powered boats. While the diver seeks out colonies of abalone amongst the reef beds, the deckhand operates the boat, known as working \"live\" and stays above where the diver is working. Bags of abalone pried from the rocks are brought to the surface by the diver or by way of \"shot line\", where the deckhand drops a weighted rope for the catch bag to be connected then retrieved. Divers measure each abalone before removing from the reef and the deckhand remeasures each abalone and removes excess weed growth from the shell. Since 2002, the Victorian industry has seen a significant decline in catches, with the total allowable catch reduced from 1440 to 787 tonnes for the 2011/12 fishing year, due to dwindling stocks and most notably the abalone virus [[ganglioneuritis]], which is fast-spreading and lethal to abalone stocks.\n\n====United States====\n[[File:Workers drying abalone shells in the sun in southern California (CHS-1399).jpg|thumb|Workers drying abalone shells in the sun in southern California, ''circa'' 1900]]\n[[File:Japanese Abalone Diver.jpg|thumb|A young Japanese Abalone Diver in California in 1905]]\n[[Image:White abalone Haliotis sorenseni.jpg|thumb|right|Two highly endangered white abalone: Prohibitions on commercial and recreational harvest of this species have been \nin place since 1996.]]\nSport harvesting of [[red abalone]] is permitted with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card.

''Haliotis iris'' (or blackfoot ''p\u0101ua'') is the ubiquitous New Zealand ''p\u0101ua'', the highly polished nacre of which is extremely popular as souvenirs with its striking blue, green, and purple iridescence. ''[[Haliotis australis]]'' and ''[[Haliotis virginea]]'' are also found in New Zealand waters, but are less popular than ''H. iris''.\n\nLike all New Zealand shellfish, recreational harvesting of ''p\u0101ua'' does not require a permit provided catch limits, size restrictions, and seasonal and local restrictions set by the [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]] (MPI) are followed. The legal recreational daily limit is 10 per diver, with a minimum shell length of {{convert|125|mm|abbr=on}} for ''H. iris'' and {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} for ''H. australis''. In addition, no person may be in possession, even on land, of more than 20 ''p\u0101ua'' or more than {{convert|2.5|kg|abbr=on}} of ''p\u0101ua'' meat at any one time. ''P\u0101ua'' can only be caught by free-diving; it is illegal to catch them using scuba gear.\n\nAn extensive global black market exists in collecting and exporting abalone meat. This can be a particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest ''p\u0101ua'' can be granted legally under [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] customary rights. When such permits to harvest are abused, it is frequently difficult to police. The limit is strictly enforced by roving [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]] fishery officers with the backing of the New Zealand Police.  [[Poaching]] is a major industry in New Zealand with many thousands being taken illegally, often undersized. Convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear, boats, and motor vehicles and fines and in rare cases, imprisonment.\n\n====South Africa====\nThe largest abalone in South Africa, ''[[Haliotis midae]]'', occurs along roughly two-thirds of the country\u2019s coastline. Abalone-diving has been a recreational activity for many years, but stocks are currently being threatened by illegal commercial harvesting.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Plag\u00e1nyi|first=\u00c9va|last2=Butterworth|first2=Doug|last3=Burgener|first3=Markus|date=2011-01-01|title=Illegal and unreported fishing on abalone\u2014Quantifying the extent using a fully integrated assessment model|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783610002882|journal=Fisheries Research|volume=107|issue=1\u20133|pages=221\u2013232|doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2010.11.005}}</ref> In South Africa, all persons harvesting this shellfish need permits that are issued annually, and no abalone may be harvested using scuba gear.\n\nFor the last few years, however, no permits have been issued for collecting abalone, but commercial harvesting still continues as does illegal collection by [[Criminal organization|syndicates]].<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2007}}</ref>\nIn 2007, because of widespread [[poaching]] of abalone, the South African government listed abalone as an endangered species according to the [[CITES]] section III appendix, which requests member governments to monitor the trade in this species. This listing was removed from CITES in June 2010 by the South African government and South African abalone is no longer subject to CITES trade controls. Export permits are still required, however.\nThe abalone meat from South Africa is prohibited for sale in the country to help reduce poaching; however, much of the illegally harvested meat is sold in Asian countries. As of early 2008, the wholesale price for abalone meat was approximately US$40.00 per kilogram. There is an active trade in the shells, which sell for more than US$1,400 per metric tonne.\n\n==== Channel-Islands, Brittany and Normandy ====\nOrmers (''[[Green ormer|Haliotis tuberculata]]'') are considered a delicacy in the British [[Channel Islands]] as well as in adjacent areas of [[France]], and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals. This, and a recent lethal bacterial disease,<ref>http://jerseyeveningpost.com/island-life/history-heritage/ormers/</ref> has led to a dramatic depletion in numbers since the latter half of the 19th century, and \"ormering\" is now strictly regulated in order to preserve stocks. The gathering of ormers is now restricted to a number of 'ormering tides', from January 1 to April 30, which occur on the full or new moon and two days following. No ormers may be taken from the beach that are under {{convert|80|mm|in}} in shell length. Gatherers are not allowed to wear wetsuits or even put their heads underwater.

The inner shell of the abalone is an iridescent swirl of intense colours, ranging from deep cobalt blue and peacock green to purples, creams and pinks. Therefore, each pearl, natural or cultured, will have its own unique collage of colours.\n\nThe shells of abalone are occasionally used in New Age [[smudging]] ceremonies to catch falling ash.

They receive the vows of the nuns of the abbey; they may admit candidates to their order's novitiate; they may send them to study; and they may send them to do pastoral or missionary, or to work or assist\u2014to the extent allowed by canon and civil law\u2014in the administration and ministry of a parish or diocese (these activities could be inside or outside the community's territory). They have full authority in its administration. \n\nHowever, there are significant limitations. They may not administer the [[sacraments]], whose celebration is reserved to bishops, [[priest]]s, [[deacon]]s (clerics), namely, those in [[Holy Orders]]. They may make provision for an ordained cleric to help train and to admit some of their members, if needed, as altar servers, [[Extraordinary minister of Holy Communion|extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion]], or lectors\u2014all ministries which are now open to the unordained. They may not serve as a witness to a marriage except by special rescript. They may not administer Penance (Reconciliation), Anointing of the Sick ([[Extreme Unction]]), or function as an ordained celebrant or concelebrant of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (by virtue of their office and their training and institution, they may act, if the need arises, as altar servers, lectors, ushers, porters, or extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, and if need be, the Host).<ref name=ce/> They may preside over the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] which they are obliged to say with their community, speak on Scripture to their community, and give certain types of blessings not reserved to the clergy. On the other hand, they may not ordinarily preach a [[sermon]] or [[homily]], nor read the Gospel during Mass. As they do not receive episcopal ordination in the Catholic, Orthodox and Oriental Churches, they do not possess the ability to ordain others, nor do they exercise the authority they do possess under canon law over any territories outside of their monastery and its territory (though non-cloistered, non-contemplative female religious members who are based in a convent or monastery but who participate in external affairs may assist as needed by the diocesan bishop and local secular clergy and laity, in certain pastoral ministries and administrative and non-administrative functions not requiring ordained ministry or status as a male cleric in those churches or programs).<ref name=ce/> There are exigent circumstances, where due to Apostolical privilege, certain Abbesses have been granted rights and responsibilities above the normal, such as the Abbess of the [[Cistercian Monastery]] of the [[Abbey of Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de Las Huelgas]] near [[Burgos]], [[Spain]]. Also granted exceptional rights was the Abbess of the Cistercian order in [[Conversano]] [[Italy]]. She was granted the ability to appoint her own vicar-general, select and approve the confessors, along with the practice of receiving the public homage of her clergy. This practice continued until some of the duties were modified due to an appeal by the clergy to Rome. Finally in 1750, the public homage was abolished.<ref name=ce/>\n\n===History===\nHistorically, in some [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] monasteries, abbesses presided over joint-houses of monks and nuns,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> the most famous example being Saint [[Brigid of Kildare|Brigid of Kildare's]] leadership in the founding of the monastery at [[Kildare]] in [[Ireland]]. This custom accompanied Celtic monastic missions to [[France]], [[Spain]], and even to [[Rome]] itself. In 1115, Robert, the founder of [[Fontevraud Abbey]] near [[Chinon]] and [[Saumur]], France, committed the government of the whole order, men as well as women, to a female superior.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Fletcher|2007}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, the title of abbess (German ''\u00c4btissin'') has in some cases (e.g. {{Interlanguage link multi|Itzehoe Convent|de|3=Kloster Itzehoe}}) survived to designate the heads of abbeys which since the [[Protestant Reformation]] have continued as monasteries or convents (German ''[[Stift]]e'').<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> These positions continued, merely changing from Catholic to Lutheran. The first to make this change was the [[Quedlinburg Abbey|Abbey of Quedlinburg]], whose last Catholic Abbess died in 1514.<ref name=ce/> These are collegiate foundations, which provide a home and an income for unmarried ladies, generally of noble birth, called canonesses (German ''Kanonissinen'') or more usually ''Stiftsdamen'' or ''Kapitularinnen''. The office of abbess is of considerable social dignity, and in the past, was sometimes filled by princesses of the reigning houses.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Until the dissolution of [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[German Mediatisation|mediatisation]] of smaller imperial fiefs by Napoleon, the evangelical Abbess of [[Quedlinburg Abbey|Quedlinburg]] was also per officio the head of that ''[[reichsunmittelbar]]'' state. The last such ruling abbess was [[Sofia Albertina, Princess of Sweden]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rambler|2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hrad\u010dany]] of [[Prague]] is a Catholic institute whose mistress is titled an Abbess. It was founded in 1755 by the [[Empress Maria Theresa]], and traditionally was responsible for the coronation of the [[Queen of Bohemia]]. The Abbess is required to be an Austrian Archduchess.<ref name=ce/>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] abbesses were known to attempt usurpation of the spiritual power forbidden them. Attempts were made to bless, give penance, make the sign of the cross on the foreheads of men, even administer the sacrament. The pope has categorized these forays into the forbidden as \"unheard of, most indecorous, and highly preposterous,\" adding that \"these Abbesses had evidently overrated theor spiritual powers a trifle.\"<ref name=ce/> The Roman Catholic Church has around 200 abbesses at present.<ref name=Colliers/> The oldest women's abbey in Germany being [[St. Marienthal Abbey]] of [[Cistercian nuns]], near [[Ostritz]], established during the early 13th-century.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of abbots and abbesses of Kildare]]\n* [[Katharina von Zimmern]] (1478\u20131547), last abbess of the [[Fraum\u00fcnster Abbey]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web |last=Fletcher |first=Adrian |year=2007 |url=http://www.paradoxplace.com/Photo%20Pages/France/North_&_Centre/Fontevraud/Fontevraud.htm |website=Paradox Place |title=The Royal Abbey of Fontevraud |access-date=8 May 2015 |archive-date=9 May 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YO1PQJmq?url=http://www.paradoxplace.com/Photo%20Pages/France/North_%26_Centre/Fontevraud/Fontevraud.htm |deadurl=yes |ref=harv |df= }}{{better source|date=May 2015}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | last = Henneberry | first = Thomas E. | editor-last = Johnston | editor-first = Bernard | encyclopedia = Collier's Encyclopedia | title = abbess | edition = 1st | year = 1997 | publisher = P.

Surgery of each abdominal organ is dealt with separately in connection with the description of that organ (see [[stomach]], [[kidney]], [[liver]], etc.) Diseases affecting the abdominal cavity are dealt with generally under their own names (e.g. [[appendicitis]]).\n\n== Types ==\nThe most common abdominal surgeries are described below.\n\n*[[Appendectomy]]\u2014Surgical opening of the abdominal cavity and removal of the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]].  Typically performed as definitive treatment for appendicitis, although sometimes the appendix is prophylactically removed incidental to another abdominal procedure.\n*[[Caesarean section]] (also known as C-section) is a surgical procedure in which one or more incisions are made through a mother's abdomen (laparotomy) and uterus (hysterotomy) to deliver one or more babies, or, rarely, to remove a dead fetus.\n*[[Inguinal hernia surgery]]\u2014This refers to the repair of an [[inguinal hernia]].\n*Exploratory [[laparotomy]]\u2014This refers to the opening of the [[abdominal cavity]] for direct examination of its contents, for example, to locate a source of bleeding or [[Physical trauma|trauma]]. It may or may not be followed by repair or removal of the primary problem.\n*[[Laparoscopy]]\u2014A [[minimally invasive]] approach to abdominal surgery where rigid tubes are inserted through small incisions into the abdominal cavity. The tubes allow introduction of a small camera, surgical instruments, and gases into the cavity for direct or indirect visualization and treatment of the abdomen. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to facilitate visualization and, often, a small video camera is used to show the procedure on a monitor in the operating room.  The surgeon manipulates instruments within the abdominal cavity to perform procedures such as cholecystectomy ([[gallbladder]] removal), the most common laparoscopic procedure.  The laparoscopic method speeds recovery time and reduces blood loss and infection as compared to the traditional \"open\" method.\n\n== Complications ==\nComplications of abdominal surgery include, but are not limited to:\n* [[Adhesion (medicine)|Adhesions]] (also called scar tissue): Complications of postoperative adhesion formation are frequent, they have a large negative effect on patients\u2019 health, and increase workload in clinical practice<ref name=Broek>{{cite journal |vauthors =Broek R, Issa Y, Van Santbrink E, Bouvy N |title=Burden of adhesions in abdominal and pelvic surgery: systematic review and met-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=347 |issue= |pages=f5588 |year=2013 |pmid= |doi=10.1136/bmj.f5588 |display-authors=etal|hdl=2066/125383}}</ref> \n* [[Hemorrhage|Bleeding]]\n* [[Infection]]\n* [[Paralytic ileus]] (sometimes called [[ileus]]): short-term paralysis of the bowel\n* [[Perioperative mortality]] (death)\n* [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]]\n\nSterile technique, [[aseptic]] post-operative care, [[antibiotics]], use of the [[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]], and vigilant post-operative monitoring greatly reduce the risk of these complications.  Planned surgery performed under sterile conditions is much less risky than that performed under emergency or unsterile conditions.  The contents of the bowel are unsterile, and thus leakage of bowel contents, as from trauma, substantially increases the risk of infection.\n\nGlobally, there are few studies comparing [[perioperative mortality]] following abdominal surgery across different health systems. One major prospective study of 10,745 adult patients undergoing emergency [[laparotomy]] from 357 centres in 58 high-, middle-, and low-income countries found that mortality is three times higher in low- compared with high-HDI countries even when adjusted for prognostic factors.<ref name=GlobalSurg2016>{{Cite journal|vauthors=((GlobalSurg Collaborative))|title=Mortality of emergency abdominal surgery in high-, middle- and low-income countries|journal=British Journal of  Surgery|volume=103|issue=8|pages=971\u2013988|year=2016|pmid=27145169|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10151|doi=10.1002/bjs.10151}}</ref> In this study the overall global mortality rate was 1\u00b76 per cent at 24\u2009hours (high 1\u00b71 per cent, middle 1\u00b79 per cent, low 3\u00b74 per cent; P < 0\u00b7001), increasing to 5\u00b74 per cent by 30 days (high 4\u00b75 per cent, middle 6\u00b70 per cent, low 8\u00b76 per cent; P < 0\u00b7001). Of the 578 patients who died, 404 (69\u00b79 per cent) did so between 24\u2009h and 30 days following surgery (high 74\u00b72 per cent, middle 68\u00b78 per cent, low 60\u00b75 per cent). Patient safety factors were suggested to play an important role, with use of the [[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]] associated with reduced mortality at 30 days.\n\nTaking a similar approach, a unique global study of 1,409 children undergoing emergency [[laparotomy]] from 253 centres in 43 countries showed that adjusted mortality in children following surgery may be as high as 7 times greater in low-HDI and middle-HDI countries compared with high-HDI countries, translating to 40 excess deaths per 1000 procedures performed in these settings.

It is situated on the [[Abens]] river, a tributary of the [[Danube]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe town lies on the [[Abens]] river, a tributary of the [[Danube]], around eight kilometres from the river's source. The area around Abensberg is characterized by the narrow valley of the Danube, where the [[Weltenburg Abbey]] stands, the valley of the [[Altm\u00fchl]] in the north, a left tributary of the Danube, and the famous [[Hallertau]] [[Humulus|hops-planting]] region in the south. The town is divided into the municipalities of Abensberg, Arnhofen, Holzharlanden, H\u00f6rlbach, Offenstetten, Pullach and Sandharland.\n\n===Divisions===\nSince the administrative reforms in Bavaria in the 1970s, the town also encompasses the following ''[[Quarter (country subdivision)|Ortsteile]]'':\n* In the town: Abensberg (main settlement), Aunkofen (civil parish), Badhaus (village)\n* To the east: Gaden (village), See (village), Offenstetten (civil parish)\n* To the north east: Arnhofen (civil parish), Baiern (village), Pullach (civil parish), Kleedorf (village)\n* To the north: Sandharlanden (civil parish), Holzharlanden (civil parish), Buchhof (small [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]])\n* To the west: Schwaighausen (village), Schillhof (hamlet), Gilla (small hamlet)\n* To the south: Aum\u00fchle (small hamlet), Allersdorf (hamlet)\n* To the south east: Lehen (small hamlet), Mitterh\u00f6rlbach (hamlet), Upper H\u00f6rlbach (village), Lower H\u00f6rlbach (hamlet)\n\n==History==\nThere had been settlement on this part of the [[Abens]] river since long before the [[High Middle Ages]], dating back to [[Neolithic]] times. Of particular interest and national importance are the Neolithic flint mines at Arnhofen, where, around 7,000 years ago, [[Stone Age]] people made flint, which was fashioned into drills, blades and arrowheads, and was regarded as the steel of the Stone Age. Traces of over 20,000 individuals were found on this site. The modern history of Abensberg, which is often incorrectly compared with that of the 3rd century Roman [[castra]] (military outpost) of Abusina, begins with Gebhard, who was the first to mention Abensberg as a town, in the middle of the 12th century. The earliest written reference to the town, under the name of ''Habensperch'', came from this time, in around 1138. Gebhard was from the Babonen clan.\n\nIn 1256, the [[castrum]] of ''Abensprech'' was first mentioned, and on 12 June 1348, Margrave Ludwig of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], and his brother, Duke Stephen of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], raised Abensberg to the status of a city, giving it the right to operate lower courts, enclose itself with a wall and hold markets. The wall was built by Count Ulrich III of [[County of Abensberg|Abensberg]]. Some of the thirty-two round towers and eight turrets are still preserved to this day.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the people of Abensberg enjoyed a level of autonomy above their lord. They elected a city council, although only a small number of rich families were eligible for election.\n\nIn around 1390, the Carmelite Monastery of Our Lady of Abensberg was founded by Count John II and his wife, Agnes. Although Abensberg was an autonomous city, it remained dependent on the powerful [[List of rulers of Bavaria|Dukes of Bavaria]]. The last Lord of Abensberg, [[Niclas, Graf von Abensberg]], supposedly named after his godfather, [[Nicholas of Kues]], a Catholic cardinal, was murdered in 1485 by Christopher, a [[Herzog|Duke]] of [[Bavaria-Munich]]. The year before, Niclas had unchivalrously taken Christopher captive as he bathed before a tournament in Munich. Although Christopher renounced his claim for revenge, he lay in wait for Niclas in Freising. When the latter arrived, he was killed by Seitz von Frauenberg. He is buried in the former convent of Abensberg. \n\nAbensberg then lost its independence and became a part of the Duchy of Bavaria, and from then on was administered by a ducal official, the so-called caretaker. The castle of Abensberg was destroyed during the [[Thirty Years' War]], although the city had bought a guarantee of protection from the Swedish general, [[Carl Gustaf Wrangel]]. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], who had occupied Bavaria, granted the fief of Abensberg to count Ernst von [[Abensberg-Traun|Abensperg und Traun]] (1608\u20131668) from an Austrian noble family named Traun that now received the name of the former counts of Abensberg (who were believed to be distant relatives). After the occupation ended, he was however dispossessed. \n\n[[Johannes Aventinus]] (1477\u20131534) is the city's most famous son, the founder of the study of history in Bavaria. Aventinus, whose name was real name is Johann or Johannes Turmair (''Aventinus'' being the Latin name of his birthplace) wrote the ''Annals of Bavaria'', a valuable record of the early history of Germany and the first major written work on the subject. He is commemorated in the [[Walhalla temple]], a monument near [[Regensburg]] to the distinguished figures of German history. Until 1800, Abensberg was a municipality belonging to the [[Straubing]] district of the [[Electorate of Bavaria]]. Abensberg also contained a magistrates' court. In the [[Battle of Abensberg]] on 19\u201320 April 1809, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] gained a significant victory over the Austrians under Archduke [[Archduke Louis of Austria|Ludwig]] of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] and General [[Johann von Hiller]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abensberg|volume=1|page=42}}</ref>\n\n===Arms===\n[[File:Wappen von Abensberg.svg|thumb|right|100px|Arms of Abensberg]]\n\nThe arms of the city are divided into two halves. On the left are the blue and white rhombuses of Bavaria, while the right half is split into two silver and black triangles. Two diagonally-crossed silver swords with golden handles rest on top.\n\nThe town has had a coat of arms since 1338, that of the Counts of Abensberg. With the death of the last Count, Nicholas of Abensberg, in 1485, the estates fell to the [[Duchy of Bavaria-Munich]], meaning that henceforth only the Bavarian coat of arms was ever used.\n\nOn 31 December 1809, a decree of [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King Maximilian]] of [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] granted the city a new coat of arms, as a recognition of their (mainly humanitarian and logistic) services in the [[Battle of Abensberg]] the same year. The diagonally divided field in silver and black came from the old crest of the Counts of Abensberg, while the white and blue diamonds came from that of the [[House of Wittelsbach]], the rulers of Bavaria. The swords recall the Battle of Abensberg.\n\nThe district of Offenstetten previously possessed its own coat of arms.\n\n===Twinning===\n* [[Parga]] in [[Greece]] since 1986\n* [[Lonigo]] in [[Italy]] since 1999\n\n==Economy and Infrastructure==\nThe area around Abensberg, the so-called sand belt between [[Siegburg]], [[Neustadt an der Donau]], Abensberg and [[Langquaid]], is used for the intensive farming of [[asparagus]], due to the optimal soil condition and climate. 212 hectares of land can produce ninety-four asparagus plants. Abensberg asparagus enjoys a reputation among connoisseurs as a particular delicacy. In addition to asparagus, the production of hops plays a major role locally, the region having its own label, and there are still three independent breweries in the area. The town of Abensberg marks the start of the ''Deutsche Hopfenstra\u00dfe'' (''German Hops Road''), a nickname given to the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe]] 301, a German federal highway which runs through the heartland of Germany's hops-growing industry, ending in [[Freising]].\n\n===Transport===\nThe Abensberg railway station is located on the [[Danube Valley Railway (Bavaria)|Danube Valley Railway]] from [[Regensburg Hauptbahnhof|Regensburg]] to [[Ingolstadt Hauptbahnhof|Ingolstadt]]. The city can be reached via the A-93 Holledau-Regensburg road (exit Abensberg). Three [[Bundesstra\u00dfe]] (German federal highways) cross south of Abensberg: [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 16|B 16]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 299|B 299]] and B 301.\n\n==Public facilities==\n\n===Schools===\n{{see also|Education in Germany}}\nAbensberg has a Grundschule (primary school) and [[Hauptschule]] (open admission secondary school), and the Johann-Turmair-[[Realschule]](secondary modern school). There is also a College of Agriculture and Home Economics. Since 2007, the Kelheim Berufsschule has had a campus in Abensberg, and outside the state sector is the St. Francis Vocational Training Centre, run by a Catholic youth organisation.\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n\n===Theatre===\nIn 2008, a former [[goods shed]] by the main railway station of Abensberg was converted into a theatre by local volunteers. The \"Theater am Bahnhof\" (''Theatre at the Railway Station'') is mostly used by the ''Theatergruppe Lampenfieber'' and was opened on 19 October 2008.\n\n===Museums===\nAbensberg has a long tradition of museums. In the nineteenth century, Nicholas Stark und Peter Paul Dollinger began a collection based on local history. This collection and the collection of the ''Heimatverein'' (local history society) were united in 1963 into the [[Johannes Aventinus|Aventinus]] Museum, in the cloister of the former Carmelite monastery. On 7 July 2006, the new Town Museum of Abensberg was opened in the former duke's castle in the town.\n\n===Kuchlbauer Brewery===\nTwo blocks west of the Old Town is the Kuchlbauer Brewery and beer garden featuring the [[Kuchlbauer Tower]], a colorful and unconventional observation tower designed by Viennese architect [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]]. The brewery and tower are open to the public.\n\n===Image gallery===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Abensberg Stadtansicht.jpg|View of the Old Town\nFile:Abensberg Klosterkirche.jpg|Carmelite Monastery\nFile:Abensberg Stadtplatz.jpg|Town Centre with Rathaus (town hall)\nFile:Abensberg RegensburgerTor.jpg|Regensburg Gate\nFile:SchlossAbensberg LandkreisKelheim Niederbayern.JPG|Site of the former castle\nFile:Herzogskasten Abensberg.JPG|Herzogskasten (Duke's storage house)\nFile:Abensberg Kuchlbauerturm von Hundertwasser.JPG|Kuchlbauer Tower\n</gallery>\n\n===Missing memorial===\nUp until the 1950s, Abensberg and the surrounding villages contained a number of graves of victims of a [[Death marches (Holocaust)|Death March]] in the Spring of 1945 from the Hersbruck sub-camp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]], who were either murdered by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] or died of exhaustion. They were originally buried where they died, but were later moved on the orders of the US military government to the cemeteries of their previous homes. At the cemetery in what is now the district of [[Pullach]] stood a memorial stone which was mentioned as recently as 1967, but which is no longer at the site. The suffering of ten unknown victims of the camp was recorded on the stone.\n\n===Regular events===\n*The Abensberger events calendar begins in February with the ''[[Carnival|Faschingsgillamoos]]'' [[funfair]], which reaches its high point on Mad Thursday.\n*There then follows the ''Fr\u00fchjahrsmarkt'' (Spring market) two weeks before Easter, when all the shops in the town are permitted to open on Sunday ([[Ladenschlussgesetz|which is normally prohibited in Bavaria]]).\n*\n*The ''B\u00fcrgerfest'' is celebrated on the first weekend of July, when the palace gardens with their ancient walls are transformed into a medieval camp.\n*The ''Schlossgartenfest'' (Palace Garden Festival) takes place every year at the beginning of August. It is organised since 1977 by the [[Junge Union]], the youth branch of Germany's two main conservative political parties, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]], and attracts all age groups from Abensberg and surrounding areas.\n*On the second Saturday in August, people can wander through the Night Market in the balmy Summer evening.\n*The ''Gillamoos'', the oldest and largest [[funfair]] in the [[Hallertau]] opens on the Thursday before the first Sunday in September and runs until the Monday thereafter. It is the highlight of the year in Abensberg and is a celebration of the people of Abensberg and the surrounding area.\n*The ''Herbstmarkt'' (autumn market), another Sunday shopping day, is on the first weekend in October.\n*Since 1997, a series of cultural, art, music and entertainment events have taken place in November at various locations in the town, under the title, ''Novembernebel'' (November fog)\n*On [[Saint Nicholas#Germany|Saint Nicholas Day]] (6 December), the ''Niklasmarkt'' (Nicholas Market) commemorates the ''Niklasspende'', a medieval foundation for the poor. This heralds the beginning of Advent and the Christmas period.\n\n==Notable residents==\n\n===Sons and daughters of the town===\n*Konrad von Abensberg (c.1075-1147): [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]] and monastic reformer\n*Erhart Falckener: crafter of [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] church furnishings\n*[[Johannes Aventinus]] (1477\u20131534): Bavarian historian\n*[[Stephan Agricola]] (1491\u20131547): Lutheran reformer\n*Gilbert Michl (1750\u20131828): Composer and Abbot of [[Steingaden Abbey|Steingaden]]\n*[[Joseph von Hazzi]] (1768\u20131845): Bavarian Privy Councillor\n*Sebastian Osterrieder (1864\u20131932): sculptor\n*Josef Stanglmeier (1918\u20131999): builder and politician\n*Alfred Edel (1932\u20131993): actor\n*Martin Neumeyer (born 1954): Member of the [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavarian State Assembly]]\n*[[Uwe Brandl]] (born 1959): Mayor of Abensberg\n*[[Paul Smaczny]]: Music and film producer\n*[[Christian Lohr]]: Musician and producer\n*[[Stephan Ebn]] (born 1978): drummer and music producer\n*[[Richard Resch]]: Tenor, classical and opera singer\n\n===People who have worked in the town===\n*Jakob Jonas (1500\u20131558): German philologist, jurist, politician and diplomat\n*[[Wigul\u00e4us von Kreittmayr]] (1705\u20131790): by marriage Lord of Offenstetten and Hatzkofen\n*Daisy d\u2019Ora (born 1913): actress and beauty queen\n*[[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]] (1928\u20132000): artist and architect\n*Andreas Fischer (born 1966): Member of the [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavarian State Assembly]]\n*[[Radu Ivan]] (born 1969): International Judo champion\n*[[Ole Bischof]] (born 1979): Olympic Judo champion\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Battle of Abensberg]] occurred April 20, 1809.\n* [[Battle of Landshut (1809)|Battle of Landshut]] occurred April 21, 1809.\n* [[Battle of Eckm\u00fchl]] occurred 21\u201322 April 1809.\n* [[Eckm\u00fchl]]\n* [[Landshut]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}} {{de icon}}\n* [http://www.abensberger-impressionen.de/ Abensberger Impressionen - Old Images of Abensberg]\n{{Commons category|Abensberg}}\n{{Cities and towns in Kelheim (district)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Spa towns in Germany]]\n[[Category:Kelheim (district)]]", "sha1": "leiu5fqymgutyqw47jlpirx9qoezryr"}}, {"title": "Arminianism", "ns": "0", "id": "1306", "revision": {"id": "866095123", "parentid": "857247867", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T06:25:35Z", "contributor": {"username": "The Transhumanist", "id": "1754504"}, "comment": "adjust portal link, including icon size", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{hatnote|\"Arminism\" and \"Arminians\" redirect here. They should not be confused with, respectively, [[Armanism]] and [[Armenians]].}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2016}}\n{{Arminianism}}\n{{Protestantism}}\n'''Arminianism''' is based on [[Christian theology|theological]] ideas of the [[Dutch Reformed]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560\u20131609) and his historic supporters known as [[Remonstrants]]. His teachings held to the [[five solae]] of the Reformation, but they were distinct from particular teachings of [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]], and other [[Protestant Reformers]]. Jacobus Arminius (Jakob Harmenszoon) was a student of [[Theodore Beza]] (Calvin's successor) at the Theological University of Geneva. Arminianism is known to some as a [[soteriological]] diversification of [[Protestant]] [[Calvinist]] [[Christianity]];<ref>\"Chambers Biographical Dictionary,\" ed. Magnus Magnusson (Chambers: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 62.</ref> to others, Arminianism is a reclamation of early Church theological consensus.<ref>Kenneth D. Keathley, \"The Work of God: Salvation,\" in ''A Theology for the Church'', ed. Daniel L. Akin (Nashville: B&H Academic, 2007), 703.</ref>\n\nDutch Arminianism was originally articulated in the Remonstrance (1610), a theological statement signed by 45 ministers and submitted to the [[States General of the Netherlands]]. The [[Synod of Dort]] (1618\u201319) was called by the States General to consider the [[Five Articles of Remonstrance]]. These articles asserted that\n\n# Salvation (and condemnation on the day of judgment) was conditioned by the graciously-enabled faith (or unbelief) of man;\n# The [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]] is qualitatively adequate for all men, \"yet that no one actually enjoys [experiences] this forgiveness of sins, except the believer ...\" and thus is limited to only those who trust in Christ;\n# \"That man has not saving grace of himself, nor of the energy of his free will,\" and unaided by the [[Holy Spirit]], no person is able to respond to God's will;\n# The [[Grace in Christianity|(Christian) Grace]] \"of God is the beginning, continuance, and accomplishment of any good,\" yet man may resist the Holy Spirit; and\n# Believers are able to resist sin through Grace, and Christ will keep them from falling; but whether they are beyond the possibility of ultimately forsaking God or \"becoming devoid of grace ... must be more particularly determined from the Scriptures.\"\n\n\"These points\", note Keith D. Stanglin and Thomas H. McCall, \"are consistent with the views of Arminius; indeed, some come verbatim from his ''Declaration of Sentiments''. Those who signed this remonstrance and others who supported its theology have since been known as [[Remonstrants]].\"<ref>See ''Jacob Arminius: Theologian of Grace'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012), 190.</ref>\n\nMany Christian denominations have been influenced by Arminian views on the will of man being freed by Grace prior to regeneration, notably the [[Baptists]] in the 16th century,<ref>Robert G. Torbet, ''A History of the Baptists'', third edition</ref> the [[Methodists]] in the 18th century and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in the 19th century.  Some falsely assert that [[Christian Universalism|Universalists]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] in the 18th and 19th centuries were theologically linked with Arminianism.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Denominations such as the [[Anabaptists]] (beginning in 1525), [[Waldensians]] (pre-Reformation),<ref>\"The Waldensian Way to God\", Joseph Visconti, page 253 and following</ref> and other groups prior to the Reformation have also affirmed that each person may choose the contingent response of either resisting God's grace or yielding to it.\n\nThe original beliefs of Jacobus Arminius himself are commonly defined as Arminianism, but more broadly, the term may embrace the teachings of [[Hugo Grotius]], [[John Wesley]], and others as well. [[Arminianism#Classical Arminianism|Classical Arminianism]], to which Arminius is the main contributor, and [[Arminianism#Wesleyan Arminianism|Wesleyan Arminianism]], to which John Wesley is the main contributor, are the two main schools of thought. Wesleyan Arminianism is often identical with Methodism. Some schools of thought, notably [[semipelagianism]]\u2014which teaches that the first step of Salvation is by human will<ref>Stanglin and McCall, 160.</ref>\u2014are confused as being Arminian in nature. But classical Arminianism holds that the first step of Salvation is solely the grace of God.<ref>F. Leroy Forlines, ''Classical Arminianism: A Theology of Salvation'', ed. J. Matthew Pinson (Nashville: Randall House Publications, 2011), 20-24.</ref> Historically, the [[Council of Orange (529)]] condemned semi-Pelagian thought (as well as [[Supralapsarian]] Calvinism), and is accepted by some as a document which can be understood as teaching a doctrine between [[Augustinian]] thought and semi-Pelagian thought, relegating Arminianism to the orthodoxy of the early Church fathers.<ref>Keathley, 703.</ref>\n\nThe two systems of Calvinism and Arminianism share both history and many doctrines, and the [[History of Christianity|history of Christian theology]].  Arminianism is related to [[Calvinism]] historically.  However, because of their differences over the doctrines of divine [[predestination]] and election, many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other. The distinction is whether God allows His desire to save all to be resisted by an individual's will (in the Arminian doctrine) or if God's grace is irresistible and limited to only some (in Calvinism). Put another way, is God's sovereignty shown, in part, through His allowance of free decisions? Some Calvinists assert that the Arminian perspective presents a synergistic system of Salvation and therefore is not only by Grace, while Arminians firmly reject this conclusion.  Many consider the theological differences to be crucial differences in doctrine, while others find them to be relatively minor.<ref>Gonzalez, Justo L. ''The Story of Christianity, Vol. Two: The Reformation to the Present Day'' (New York: Harpercollins Publishers, 1985; reprint \u2013 Peabody: Prince Press, 2008) 180</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Calvinist\u2013Arminian debate|Free will in theology}}\n[[File:Jacobus Arminius 02 IV 13 2 0026 01 0309 a Seite 1 Bild 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Jacobus Arminius]], from ''Kupferstich aus Theatrum Europaeum'' by Matthaeus Merian in 1662]]\nJacobus Arminius was a Dutch pastor and theologian in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He was taught by [[Theodore Beza]], [[John Calvin|Calvin's]] hand-picked successor, but after examination of the scriptures, he rejected his teacher's theology that it is God who unconditionally elects some for salvation. Instead Arminius proposed that the election of God was ''of believers'', thereby making it [[Conditional election|conditional on faith]]. Arminius's views were challenged by the Dutch Calvinists, especially [[Franciscus Gomarus]], but Arminius died before a national synod could occur.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nArminius's followers, not wanting to adopt their leader's name, called themselves the [[Remonstrants]]. When Arminius died before he could satisfy Holland's State General's request for a 14-page paper outlining his views, the Remonstrants replied in his stead crafting the [[Five articles of Remonstrance]]. After some political maneuvering, the Dutch Calvinists were able to convince [[Maurice de Nassau|Prince Maurice of Nassau]] to deal with the situation. Maurice systematically removed Arminian magistrates from office and called a national synod at Dordrecht. This [[Synod of Dort]] was open primarily to Dutch Calvinists (Arminians were excluded) with Calvinist representatives from other countries, and in 1618 published a condemnation of Arminius and his followers as heretics. Part of this publication was the famous [[Five points of Calvinism]] in response to the five articles of Remonstrance.\n\nArminians across Holland were removed from office, imprisoned, banished, and sworn to silence. Twelve years later Holland officially granted Arminianism protection as a religion, although animosity between Arminians and Calvinists continued.\n===Baptists===\nThe debate between Calvin's followers and Arminius's followers is distinctive of post-Reformation church history. The emerging Baptist movement in 17th-century England, for example, was a microcosm of the historic debate between Calvinists and Arminians. The first Baptists\u2014called \"[[General Baptists]]\" because of their confession of a \"general\" or unlimited atonement\u2014were Arminians.<ref>Gonzalez, Justo L. ''The Story of Christianity, Vol. 2: The Reformation to the Present Day'' (HarperCollins Publishers, 1985; reprint \u2013 Peabody: Prince Press, 2008) 225\u2013226</ref> The Baptist movement originated with [[Thomas Helwys]], who left his mentor John Smyth (who had moved into shared belief and other distinctives of the Dutch Waterlander Mennonites of Amsterdam) and returned to London to start the first English Baptist Church in 1611. Later General Baptists such as John Griffith, Samuel Loveday, and [[Thomas Grantham (Baptist)|Thomas Grantham]] defended a Reformed Arminian theology that reflected more the Arminianism of Arminius than that of the later Remonstrants or the English Arminianism of Arminian [[Puritans]] like John Goodwin or Anglican Arminians such as [[Jeremy Taylor]] and [[Henry Hammond]]. The General Baptists encapsulated their Arminian views in numerous confessions, the most influential of which was the Standard Confession of 1660. In the 1640s the Particular Baptists were formed, diverging strongly from Arminian doctrine and embracing the strong Calvinism of the Presbyterians and Independents. Their robust Calvinism was publicized in such confessions as the London Baptist Confession of 1644 and the Second London Confession of 1689. The London Confession of 1689 was later used by Calvinistic Baptists in America (called the Philadelphia Baptist Confession), whereas the Standard Confession of 1660 was used by the American heirs of the English General Baptists, who soon came to be known as [[Free Will Baptists]].\n\n===Methodists===\nThis same dynamic between Arminianism and [[Calvinism]] can be seen in the heated discussions between friends and fellow [[Anglican]] ministers [[John Wesley]] and [[George Whitefield]]. Wesley was a champion of Arminian teachings, defending his [[soteriology]] in a periodical titled ''The Arminian'' and writing articles such as ''Predestination Calmly Considered''. He defended Arminianism against charges of [[semi-Pelagianism]], holding strongly to beliefs in [[original sin]] and total depravity. At the same time, Wesley attacked the [[determinism]] that he claimed characterized unconditional election and maintained a belief in the [[Conditional Preservation of the Saints|ability to lose salvation]]. Wesley also clarified the doctrine of [[prevenient grace]] and preached the ability of Christians to attain to [[Christian perfection|perfection]] (fully mature, not \"sinlessness\"). While Wesley freely made use of the term \"Arminian,\" he did not self-consciously root his soteriology in the theology of Arminius but was highly influenced by 17th-century English Arminianism and thinkers such as [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], [[Jeremy Taylor]] and [[Henry Hammond]] of the Anglican \"Holy Living\" school, and the Remonstrant [[Hugo Grotius]].\n\n== Current landscape ==\n{{Infobox religious group |name=Arminianism |religions={{hlist|[[Arminianism in the Church of England|Church of England]]|[[Methodism]]|[[General Baptists]]|[[Holiness movement]]|[[Charismatic movement]]|[[Pentecostalism]]}}}}\n\nAdvocates of both Arminianism and Calvinism find a home in many Protestant denominations, and sometimes both exist within the same denomination. Faiths leaning at least in part in the Arminian direction include [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Free Will Baptist]]s, [[Christian Churches and Churches of Christ]], [[General Baptist]]s, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Church of the Nazarene]], [[The Wesleyan Church]], [[The Salvation Army]], [[Conservative Mennonites]], [[Old Order Mennonites]], [[Amish]] and [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismatics]]. Denominations leaning in the Calvinist direction are grouped as the [[Reformed churches]] and include [[Particular Baptist]]s, [[Reformed Baptist]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s, and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. The majority of [[Southern Baptists]], including [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]], accept Arminianism with an exception allowing for a doctrine of [[perseverance of the saints]] (\"eternal security\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp#iv|title=Southern Baptist Convention > SBC Search|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2016}}</ref><ref>Harmon, Richard W.

[[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] espouse a view of salvation and election distinct from both the Calvinist and Arminian schools of [[soteriology]].\n\nThe current scholarly support for Arminianism is wide and varied. One particular thrust is a return to the teachings of Arminius. F. Leroy Forlines, Robert Picirilli, Stephen Ashby and Matthew Pinson (see citations) are four of the more prominent supporters. Forlines has referred to this type of Arminianism as \"Classical Arminianism,\" while Picirilli, Pinson, and Ashby have termed it \"Reformation Arminianism\" or \"Reformed Arminianism.\"  Through [[Methodism]], Wesley's teachings also inspire a large scholarly following, with vocal proponents including [[J. Kenneth Grider]], [[Stanley Hauerwas]], [[Thomas Oden]], [[Thomas Jay Oord]], and [[William Willimon]].\n\nRecent influence of the [[New Perspective on Paul]] movement has also reached Arminianism \u2014 primarily through a view of corporate election. The New Perspective scholars propose that the 1st-century [[Second Temple Judaism]] understood election primarily as national ([[Israelites]]) and racial ([[Jews]]), not as individual. Their conclusion is thus that Paul's writings on election should be interpreted in a similar corporate light.\n\n==Theology==\n{{Five Articles}}\nArminian theology usually falls into one of two groups \u2014 Classical Arminianism, drawn from the teaching of Jacobus Arminius \u2014 and Wesleyan Arminian, drawing primarily from Wesley. Both groups overlap substantially.\n\n===Classical Arminianism===\nClassical Arminianism is the theological system that was presented by [[Jacobus Arminius]] and maintained by some of the [[Remonstrants]];<ref>Ashby, Stephen \"Reformed Arminianism\" ''Four Views on Eternal Security'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2002), 137</ref> its influence serves as the foundation for all Arminian systems. A list of beliefs is given below:\n\n*'''Depravity is [[Total depravity|total]]''': Arminius states \"In this [fallen] state, the free will of man towards the true good is not only wounded, infirm, bent, and weakened; but it is also imprisoned, destroyed, and lost. And its powers are not only debilitated and useless unless they be assisted by grace, but it has no powers whatever except such as are excited by Divine grace.\"<ref>Arminius, James ''The Writings of James Arminius'' (three vols.), tr. [[James Nichols (printer)|James Nichols]] and William R. Bagnall (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1956), I:252</ref>\n*'''Atonement is intended [[Unlimited atonement|for all]]''': Jesus's death was for all people, Jesus draws all people to himself, and all people have opportunity for salvation through faith.<ref>Arminius I:316</ref>\n*'''Jesus's death [[Atonement (Satisfaction view)|satisfies]] God's justice''': The penalty for the sins of the elect is paid in full through Jesus's work on the cross. Thus Christ's atonement is intended for all, but requires faith to be effected. Arminius states that \"Justification, when used for the act of a Judge, is either purely the imputation of righteousness through mercy\u2026 or that man is justified before God\u2026 according to the rigor of justice without any forgiveness.\"<ref>Arminius III:454</ref> Stephen Ashby clarifies: \"Arminius allowed for only two possible ways in which the sinner might be justified: (1) by our absolute and perfect adherence to the law, or (2) purely by God's imputation of Christ's righteousness.\"<ref>Ashby ''Four Views'', 140</ref>\n*'''Grace is resistible''': God takes initiative in the salvation process and his grace comes to all people. This grace (often called ''[[Prevenient Grace|prevenient]]'' or pre-regenerating grace) acts on all people to convince them of the Gospel, draw them strongly towards salvation, and enable the possibility of sincere faith. Picirilli states that \"indeed this grace is so close to regeneration that it inevitably leads to regeneration unless finally resisted.\"<ref>Picirilli, Robert ''Grace, Faith, Free Will: Contrasting Views of Salvation: Calvinism and Arminianism'' (Nashville: Randall House Publications, 2002), 154ff</ref> The offer of salvation through grace does not act irresistibly in a purely cause-effect, deterministic method but rather in an influence-and-response fashion that can be both freely accepted and freely denied.<ref>Forlines, Leroy F., Pinson, Matthew J. and Ashby, Stephen M. ''The Quest for Truth: Answering Life's Inescapable Questions'' (Nashville: Randall House Publications, 2001), 313\u2013321</ref>\n*'''Man has a freed will to respond or resist''': Free will is granted and limited by God's sovereignty, but God's sovereignty allows all men the choice to accept the Gospel of Jesus through faith, simultaneously allowing all men to resist.\n*'''Election is [[Conditional election|conditional]]''': Arminius defined ''election'' as \"the decree of God by which, of Himself, from eternity, He decreed to justify in Christ, believers, and to accept them unto eternal life.\"<ref name=\"Arminius III:311\">Arminius ''Writings'', III:311</ref> God alone determines who will be saved and his determination is that all who believe Jesus through faith will be justified. According to Arminius, \"God regards no one in Christ unless they are engrafted in him by faith.\"<ref name=\"Arminius III:311\" />\n*'''God predestines the elect to a glorious future''': Predestination is not the predetermination of who will believe, but rather the predetermination of the believer's future inheritance. The elect are therefore predestined to sonship through adoption, glorification, and eternal life.<ref>Pawson, David ''Once Saved, Always Saved? A Study in Perseverance and Inheritance'' (London: Hodder & Staughton, 1996), 109ff</ref>\n*'''Christ's righteousness is imputed to the believer''': Justification is sola fide (by faith alone). When individuals repent and believe in Christ (saving faith), they are regenerated and brought into union with Christ, whereby the death and righteousness of Christ are imputed to them for their justification before God.<ref>Forlines, F. Leroy, ''Classical Arminianism: A Theology of Salvation'', ch. 6</ref>\n*'''Eternal security is also [[Conditional Preservation of the Saints|conditional]]''': All believers have full assurance of salvation with the condition that they remain in Christ. Salvation is conditioned on faith, therefore perseverance is also conditioned.<ref>Picirilli ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'' 203</ref> Apostasy (turning from Christ) is only committed through a deliberate, willful rejection of Jesus and renunciation of saving faith. Such apostasy is irremediable.<ref>Picirilli 204ff</ref>\n\nOn whether a believer could commit apostasy (i.e., desert Christ by cleaving again to this evil world, losing a good conscience, or by failing to hold on to sound doctrine), Arminius declared that this matter required further study in the Scriptures.<ref name=\"Works of Arminius, 2:219-220\">''Works of Arminius,'' 2:219-220.</ref> Nevertheless, Arminius believed the Scriptures taught that believers are graciously empowered by Christ and the Holy Spirit \"to fight against Satan, sin, the world and their own flesh, and to gain the victory over these enemies.\"<ref name=\"Works of Arminius, 2:219-220\"/> Furthermore, Christ and the Spirit are ever present to aid and assist believers through various temptations. But this security was not unconditional but conditional\u2014\"provided they [believers] stand prepared for the battle, implore his help, and be not wanting to themselves, Christ preserves them from falling.\"<ref>''Works of Arminius,'' 2:219-220. This seems to fit with Arminius\u2019 other statements on the need for perseverance in faith. For example: \"God resolves to receive into favor those who repent and believe, and to save in Christ, on account of Christ, and through Christ, those who persevere [in faith], but to leave under sin and wrath those who are impenitent and unbelievers, and to condemn them as aliens from Christ\" (''Works of Arminius'', 2:465; cf. 2:466). In another place he writes: \"[God] wills that they, who believe and persevere in faith, shall be saved, but that those, who are unbelieving and impenitent, shall remain under condemnation\" (''Works of Arminius'', 3:412; cf. 3:413).</ref> Arminius goes on to say, \"I never taught that a true believer can, either totally or finally fall away from the faith, and perish; yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such a kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding.\"<ref>''Works of Arminius,'' 2:219-220. William Nichols notes: \"Arminius spoke nearly the same modest words when interrogated on this subject in the last Conference which he had with Gomarus [a Calvinist], before the states of Holland, on the 12th of Aug. 1609, only two months prior to his decease\" (''Works of Arminius'', 1:665). B.J. Oropeza says, \"Although Arminius denied having taught final apostasy in his ''Declaration of Sentiments'', in the ''Examination of the Treatise of Perkins on the Order and Mode of Predestination'' he writes that a person who is being 'built' into the church of Christ may resist the continuation of this process. Concerning the believers, 'It may suffice to encourage them, if they know that no power or prudence can dislodge them from the rock, unless they of their own will forsake their position.' [''Works of Arminius'', 3:455, cf. 1:667] A believing member of Christ may become slothful, give place to sin, and gradually die altogether, ceasing to be a member. [''Works of Arminius'', 3:458] The covenant of God (Jeremiah 23) 'does not contain in itself an impossibility of defection from God, but a promise of the gift of fear, whereby they shall be hindered from going away from God so long as that shall flourish in their hearts.' If there is any consistency in Arminius' position, he did not seem to deny the possibility of falling away\" (''Paul and Apostasy'', 16).</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Arminius in 1609, the Remonstrants maintained their leader's view on conditional security and his uncertainty regarding the possibility of believers committing apostasy. This is evidenced in the fifth article drafted by its leaders in 1610.<ref>The Article reads: That those who are incorporated into Christ by a true faith, and have thereby become partakers of his life-giving Spirit, have thereby full power to strive against Satan, sin, the world, and their own flesh, and to win the victory; it being well understood that it is ever through the assisting grace of the Holy Ghost; and that Jesus Christ assists them through his Spirit in all temptations, extends to them his hand, and if only they are ready for the conflict, and desire his help, and are not inactive, keeps them from falling, so that they, by not craft or power of Satan, can be misled nor plucked out of Christ's hand, according to the Word of Christ, John 10:28: 'Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.'  But whether they are capable, through negligence, of forsaking again the first beginnings of their life in Christ, of again returning to this present evil world, of turning away from the holy doctrine which was delivered them, of losing a good conscience, of becoming devoid of grace, that must be more particularly determined out of the Holy Scripture, before we ourselves can teach it with full persuasion of our minds. (Philip Schaff, editor. ''The Creeds of Christendom Volume III: The Evangelical Protestant Creeds'', \"The Articles of the Remonstrants,\" 3:548-549)</ref> However, sometime between 1610, and the official proceeding of the Synod of Dort (1618), the [[Remonstrants]] became fully persuaded in their minds that the Scriptures taught that a true believer was capable of falling away from faith and perishing eternally as an unbeliever. They formalized their views in \"The Opinion of the Remonstrants\" (1618).<ref>Points three and four in the fifth article read: True believers can fall from true faith and can fall into such sins as cannot be consistent with true and justifying faith; not only is it possible for this to happen, but it even happens frequently. True believers are able to fall through their own fault into shameful and atrocious deeds, to persevere and to die in them; and therefore finally to fall and to perish. (Peter Y. DeJong, ''Crisis in the Reformed Churches: Essays in Commemoration of the Great Synod of Dordt'', 1618-1619, 220ff). For more on the Remonstrant view regarding apostasy see the External Link articles: The Opinions of the Remonstrants (1618); and The Arminian Confession of 1621 and Apostasy.</ref>\n\nPicirilli remarks: \"Ever since that early period, then, when the issue was being examined again, Arminians have taught that those who are truly saved need to be warned against apostasy as a real and possible danger.\"<ref>''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 198.</ref>\n\nThe core beliefs of Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrants are summarized as such by theologian Stephen Ashby:\n\n#Prior to being ''drawn and enabled'', one is ''unable to believe\u2026 able only to resist.''\n#Having been ''drawn and enabled'', but prior to regeneration, one is ''able to believe\u2026 able also to resist.''\n#After one ''believes'', God then regenerates; one is ''able to continue believing\u2026 able also to resist.''\n#Upon ''resisting'' to the point of ''unbelief'', one is ''unable again to believe\u2026 able only to resist.''<ref>Ashby ''Four Views'', 159</ref>\n\n===Wesleyan Arminianism===\n{{Methodism |background}}\n{{further information|Wesleyanism|Methodism}}\nJohn Wesley has historically been the most influential advocate for the teachings of Arminian soteriology. Wesley thoroughly agreed with the vast majority of what Arminius himself taught, maintaining strong doctrines of original sin, total depravity, conditional election, prevenient grace, unlimited atonement, and the possibility of apostasy.\n\nWesley departs from Classical Arminianism primarily on three issues:\n; Atonement\n: Wesley's atonement is a hybrid of the [[penal substitution]] theory and the [[Atonement (Governmental view)|governmental]] theory of [[Hugo Grotius]], a lawyer and one of the Remonstrants. Steven Harper states, \"Wesley does not place the substitionary element primarily within a legal framework...Rather [his doctrine seeks] to bring into proper relationship the 'justice' between God's love for persons and God's hatred of sin...it is not the satisfaction of a legal demand for justice so much as it is an act of mediated reconciliation.\"<ref>Harper, Steven \"Wesleyan Arminianism\" ''Four Views on Eternal Security'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2002) 227ff</ref>\n; Possibility of apostasy\n: Wesley fully accepted the Arminian view that genuine Christians could apostatize and lose their salvation, as his famous sermon \"A Call to Backsliders\" clearly demonstrates. Harper summarizes as follows: \"the act of committing sin is not in itself ground for the loss of salvation...the loss of salvation is much more related to experiences that are profound and prolonged. Wesley sees two primary pathways that could result in a permanent fall from grace: unconfessed sin and the actual expression of apostasy.\"<ref>Harper 239\u2013240</ref> Wesley disagrees with Arminius, however, in maintaining that such apostasy was not final. When talking about those who have made \"shipwreck\" of their faith (1 Tim 1:19), Wesley claims that \"not one, or a hundred only, but I am persuaded, several thousands...innumerable are the instances...of those who had fallen but now stand upright.\"<ref>Wesley, John, \"A Call to Backsliders\" in ''The Works of John Wesley'', ed. Thomas Jackson, 14 vols. (London: Wesley Methodist Book Room, 1872; repr, Grand Rapids: Baker, 1986) 3:211ff</ref>\n; [[Christian perfection]]\n: According to Wesley's teaching, Christians could attain a state of practical perfection, meaning a lack of all voluntary sin by the empowerment of the Holy Spirit, in this life. Christian perfection (or ''entire sanctification''), according to Wesley, is \"purity of intention, dedicating all the life to God\" and \"the mind which was in Christ, enabling us to walk as Christ walked.\" It is \"loving God with all our heart, and our neighbor as ourselves\".<ref name=\"xqpwlw\">Wesley, John \"A Plain Account of Christian Perfection\", ''Works''</ref> It is \"a restoration not only to the favour, but likewise to the image of God,\" our \"being filled with the fullness of God\".<ref>Wesley, John \"The End of Christ\u2019s Coming\", ''Works''</ref> Wesley was clear that Christian perfection did not imply perfection of bodily health or an infallibility of judgment. It also does not mean we no longer violate the will of God, for involuntary transgressions remain. Perfected Christians remain subject to temptation, and have continued need to pray for forgiveness and holiness. It is not an absolute perfection but a perfection in love. Furthermore, Wesley did not teach a salvation by perfection, but rather says that, \"Even perfect holiness is acceptable to God only through Jesus Christ.\"<ref name=\"xqpwlw\"/>\n\n===Other variations===\nSince the time of Arminius, his name has come to represent a very large variety of beliefs. Some of these beliefs, such as Pelagianism and semi-Pelagianism (see [[Arminianism#Pelagianism|below]]) are not considered to be within Arminian orthodoxy and are dealt with elsewhere. Some doctrines, however, do adhere to the Arminian foundation and, while minority views, are highlighted below.\n\n====Open theism====\n{{Main article|Open theism}}\nThe doctrine of open theism states that God is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient, but differs on the nature of the future. Open theists claim that the future is not completely determined (or \"settled\") because people have not made their free decisions yet. God therefore knows the future partially in possibilities (human free actions) rather than solely certainties (divinely determined events). As such, open theists resolve the issue of human [[free will]] and God's sovereignty by claiming that God is sovereign because he does not ordain each human choice, but rather works in cooperation with his creation to bring about his will. This notion of sovereignty and freedom is foundational to their understanding of [[love]] since open theists believe that love is not genuine unless it is freely chosen. The power of choice under this definition has the potential for as much harm as it does good, and open theists see free will as the best answer to the [[problem of evil]]. Well-known proponents of this theology are [[Gregory A. Boyd|Greg Boyd]], [[Clark Pinnock]], [[Thomas Jay Oord]], [[William Hasker]], and [[John E. Sanders]].\n\nSome Arminians, such as professor and theologian Robert Picirilli, reject the doctrine of open theism as a \"deformed Arminianism\".<ref>Picirilli, ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 40 \u2013 Picirilli actually objects so strongly to the link between Arminianism and Open theism that he devotes an entire section to his objections. See 59ff.</ref> Joseph Dongell stated that \"open theism actually moves beyond classical Arminianism towards [[process theology]].\"<ref>Dongell, Joseph and Walls, Jerry ''Why I Am Not a Calvinist'', 45</ref> There are also some Arminians, like Roger Olson, who believe Open theism to be an alternative view that a Christian can have. The majority Arminian view accepts [[Classical Theism|classical theism]] \u2013 the belief that God's power, knowledge, and presence have no external limitations, that is, outside of his divine nature. Most Arminians reconcile human free will with God's sovereignty and foreknowledge by holding three points:\n*Human free will is limited by original sin, though God's [[prevenient grace]] restores to humanity the ability to accept God's call of salvation.<ref>Picirilli, ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 42\u201343, 59ff</ref><ref>Ashby, ''Four Views on Eternal Security'', 146\u2013147</ref>\n*God purposely exercises his sovereignty in ways that do not illustrate its extent \u2013 in other words, He has the power and authority to predetermine salvation but he chooses to apply it through different means.\n*God's foreknowledge of the future is exhaustive and complete, and therefore the future is certain and not contingent on human action. God does not determine the future, but He does know it. God's certainty and human contingency are compatible.<ref>Picirilli, ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 40</ref>\n\n====Corporate view of election====\n{{further information|Conditional election|Corporate election}}\nThe majority Arminian view is that election is individual and based on God's foreknowledge of faith, but a second perspective deserves mention. These Arminians reject the concept of individual election entirely, preferring to understand the doctrine in corporate terms. According to this corporate election, God never chose individuals to elect to salvation, but rather He chose to elect the believing church to salvation. Dutch Reformed theologian Herman Ridderbos says \"[The certainty of salvation] does not rest on the fact that the church belongs to a certain \"number\", but that it belongs to Christ, from before the foundation of the world. Fixity does not lie in a hidden decree, therefore, but in corporate unity of the Church with Christ, whom it has come to know in the gospel and has learned to embrace in faith.\"<ref>Ridderbos, Herman ''Paul: An Outline of His Theology'' trans. John Richard de Witt (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1975), 350\u2013351</ref>\n\nCorporate election draws support from a similar concept of corporate election found in the Old Testament and Jewish law. Indeed most biblical scholarship is in agreement that Judeo-Greco-Roman thought in the 1st century was opposite of the Western world's \"individual first\" mantra \u2013 it was very collectivist or communitarian in nature.<ref name=Abasciano>Abasciano, Brian ''Paul\u2019s Use of the Old Testament in Romans 9:1\u20139: An Intertextual and Theological Exegesis'' (T&T Clark Publishers, 2006), {{ISBN|0-567-03073-3}}</ref> Identity stemmed from membership in a group more than individuality.<ref name=Abasciano /> According to Romans 9\u201311, supporters claim, Jewish election as the chosen people ceased with their national rejection of Jesus as Messiah. As a result of the new covenant, God's chosen people are now the corporate body of Christ, the church (sometimes called ''spiritual Israel'' \u2013 see also [[Covenant theology]]). The pastor and theologian Brian Abasciano claims \"What Paul says about Jews, Gentiles, and Christians, whether of their place in God\u2019s plan, or their election, or their salvation, or how they should think or behave, he says from a corporate perspective which views the group as primary and those he speaks about as embedded in the group. These individuals act as members of the group to which they belong, and what happens to them happens by virtue of their membership in the group.\"<ref name=Abasciano />\n\nThese scholars also maintain that Jesus was the only human ever elected and that individuals must be \"in Christ\" (Eph 1:3\u20134) through faith to be part of the elect. This was, in fact, Swiss Reformed theologian, [[Karl Barth]]'s, understanding of the doctrine of election. Joseph Dongell, professor at Asbury Theological Seminary, states \"the most conspicuous feature of Ephesians 1:3\u20132:10 is the phrase 'in Christ', which occurs twelve times in Ephesians 1:3\u201314 alone...this means that Jesus Christ himself is the chosen one, the predestined one. Whenever one is incorporated into him by grace through faith, one comes to share in Jesus' special status as chosen of God.\"<ref>Dongell, Joseph and Walls, Jerry ''Why I am Not a Calvinist'', 76</ref> Markus Barth illustrates the inter-connectedness: \"Election in Christ must be understood as the election of God's people.

The extreme of Calvinism is [[hyper-Calvinism]], which insists that signs of election must be sought before evangelization of the unregenerate takes place and that the eternally damned have no obligation to repent and believe, and on the extreme of Arminianism is [[Pelagianism]], which rejects the doctrine of original sin on grounds of moral accountability; but the overwhelming majority of [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] pastors and theologians hold to one of these two systems or somewhere in between.\n\n====Similarities====\n*'''[[Total depravity]]''' &ndash; Arminians agree with Calvinists over the doctrine of [[total depravity]]. The differences come in the understanding of how God remedies this human depravity.\n*'''[[Substitutionary atonement|Substitutionary effect of atonement]]''' &ndash; Arminians also affirm with Calvinists the substitutionary effect of Christ's [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and that this effect is limited only to the elect. Classical Arminians would agree with Calvinists that this substitution was [[Atonement (Satisfaction view)|penal satisfaction]] for all of the elect, while most Wesleyan Arminians would maintain that the substitution was [[Atonement (Governmental view)|governmental]] in nature.\n\n====Differences====\n*'''Nature of election''' &ndash; Arminians hold that election to eternal salvation has the [[Conditional election|condition of faith]] attached. The Calvinist doctrine of [[unconditional election]] states that salvation cannot be earned or achieved and is therefore not conditional upon any human effort, so faith is not a condition of salvation but the divinely apportioned means to it. In other words, Arminians believe that they owe their election to their faith, whereas Calvinists believe that they owe their faith to their election.\n*'''Nature of grace''' &ndash; Arminians believe that, through [[prevenient grace|grace]], God restores free will concerning salvation to all humanity, and each individual, therefore, is able either to accept the Gospel call through faith or resist it through unbelief. Calvinists hold that God's grace to enable salvation is given only to the elect and [[irresistible grace|irresistibly]] leads to salvation.\n*'''Extent of the atonement''' &ndash; Arminians, along with four-point Calvinists or [[Amyraldian]]s, hold to a universal drawing and [[Unlimited atonement|universal extent of atonement]] instead of the Calvinist doctrine that the drawing and atonement is [[limited atonement|limited in extent]] to the elect only, which many Calvinists prefer to call '[[limited atonement|particular redemption]]'.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970226215554/http://www.spurgeon.org/sermons/0181.htm ]</ref> Both sides (with the exception of hyper-Calvinists) believe the invitation of the gospel is universal and \"must be presented to everyone [they] can reach without any distinction.\"<ref>Nicole, Roger, [http://www.apuritansmind.com/Arminianism/NicoleRogerUniversalCallDefiniteAtonement.htm \"Covenant, Universal Call And Definite Atonement\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215012632/http://www.apuritansmind.com/Arminianism/NicoleRogerUniversalCallDefiniteAtonement.htm |date=15 February 2006 }} ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' 38:3 (September 1995)</ref>\n*'''Perseverance in faith''' &ndash; Arminians believe that future salvation and eternal life is secured in Christ and protected from all external forces but is [[conditional preservation of the saints|conditional on remaining in Christ]] and can be lost through [[apostasy]]. Traditional Calvinists believe in the doctrine of the [[perseverance of the saints]], which says that because God chose some unto salvation and actually paid for their particular sins, he keeps them from apostasy and that those who do apostatize were never truly regenerated (that is, [[Born again Christianity|born again]]) or saved. Non-traditional Calvinists and other evangelicals advocate the similar but distinct doctrine of eternal security that teaches if a person was once saved, his or her salvation can never be in jeopardy, even if the person completely apostatizes.\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal inline|size=tiny|Arminianism}}\n{{columns |colwidth=17.0em\n| col1 =\n; Arminian doctrines\n*[[Total depravity]]\n**[[Original sin]]\n*[[Prevenient grace]]\n**[[Synergism (theology)|Synergism]]\n*[[Unlimited atonement]] (hypothetical universalism)\n*[[Substitutionary atonement]]\n**[[Satisfaction theory of atonement|Satisfaction theory]]\n**[[Penal substitution]]\n**[[Governmental theory of atonement|Moral government]]\n*[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian free will]]\n*[[Conditional election]]\n**Individual election on the basis of foreseen faith\n**[[Corporate election]]\n*[[Conditional preservation of the saints]]\n| col2width=18.5em\n| col2 =\n; People, history, denominations\n*[[Jacobus Arminius]]\n*[[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]]\n*[[Hugo Grotius]]\n*[[Remonstrants|The Remonstrants]]\n**[[Simon Episcopius]]\n**Five articles of the Remonstrance\n*[[Laudianism]] ([[Anglican Communion|Anglican]])\n**[[William Laud]]\n**[[Lancelot Andrewes]]\n*[[Methodism]]\n**[[John Wesley]]\n**[[Charles Wesley]]\n*[[Anabaptists]]\n**[[Mennonites]]\n**[[Hutterites]]\n**[[Amish]]\n*[[Pentecostalism]]\n*[[Baptists|General and Free Will Baptists]]\n*[[Arminianism in the Church of England]]\n*[[History of the Calvinist\u2013Arminian debate|Calvinist\u2013Arminian debate]]\n| col3 =\n; Opposing views\n*[[Calvinism]]\n**[[John Calvin]]\n**[[Theodore Beza]]\n**[[Franciscus Gomarus]]\n**Five articles of the [[Synod of Dordt]] (T.U.L.I.P.)\n***[[Unconditional election]]\n***[[Limited atonement]]\n***[[Irresistible grace]]\n***[[Perseverance of the saints]]\n**[[Belgic Confession]]\n**[[Heidelberg Catechism]]\n**[[Westminster Standards]]\n**[[Puritanism]]\n**[[Reformed Baptists|Particular and Strict Baptists]]\n*[[Lutheranism]]\n*[[Christian Universalism]]\n*[[Open theism]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book | editor1-last= Pinson | editor1-first= J.

Parsons was an audio engineer and producer by profession, but also a musician and a composer. A songwriter by profession, Woolfson was also a composer, a pianist, and a singer. Almost all the songs on the Project's albums are credited to \"Woolfson/Parsons\".\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1974\u20131976: Formation and debut ===\n[[Alan Parsons]] met [[Eric Woolfson]] in the [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] of [[Abbey Road Studios]] in the summer of 1974. Parsons had already acted as Assistant Engineer on [[the Beatles]]' albums ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969) and ''[[Let It Be (The Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' (1970), had recently engineered [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973), and had produced several acts for [[EMI Records]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book\n| first= Martin C.\n| last= Strong\n| year= 2000\n| title= The Great Rock Discography\n| edition= 5th\n| publisher= Mojo Books\n| location= Edinburgh\n| pages= 729\u2013730\n| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> Woolfson, a songwriter and composer, was working as a session pianist; he had also composed material for a concept album idea based on the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.the-alan-parsons-project.com/history-read-more.html |title=History @ |publisher=The-alan-parsons-project.com |date= |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716215331/http://www.the-alan-parsons-project.com/history-read-more.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen Parsons asked Woolfson to become his manager, he accepted and subsequently managed Parsons's career as a producer and engineer through a string of successes, including [[Pilot (band)|Pilot]], [[Steve Harley]], [[Cockney Rebel]], [[John Miles (musician)|John Miles]], [[Al Stewart]], [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]], and [[the Hollies]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Parsons commented at the time that he felt frustrated in having to accommodate the views of some of the musicians, which he felt interfered with his production. Woolfson came up with the idea of making an album based on developments in the [[film industry]], where the focal point of the films' promotion shifted from film stars to directors such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]]. If the film industry was becoming a director's medium, Woolfson felt the music business might well become a producer's medium.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nRecalling his earlier Edgar Allan Poe material, Woolfson saw a way to combine his and Parsons's respective talents. Parsons would produce and engineer songs written and composed by the two, and the first Alan Parsons Project was begun. The Project's first album, ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)|Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' (1976), which was released by [[20th Century Fox Records]] and included major contributions by all members of [[Pilot (band)|Pilot]] and [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]], was a success, reaching the [[Top 40]] in the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] [[record chart|chart]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The song \"[[The Raven (song)|The Raven]]\" featured lead vocals by the actor [[Leonard Whiting]], and, according to the 2007 remastered album liner notes, was the first rock song to use a [[Digital data|digital]] [[vocoder]], with Alan Parsons speaking [[lyrics]] through it.\n\n=== 1977\u20131990: Mainstream success and final releases ===\n\n[[Arista Records]] then signed the Alan Parsons Project participants for further albums. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Project's popularity continued to grow. (However, the Project was always more popular in North America, Ibero-America, and [[Continental Europe]] than in Parsons's home country, never achieving a UK Top 40 single or Top 20 album). The [[single (music)|singles]] \"[[I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You]]\", \"[[Games People Play (Alan Parsons Project song)|Games People Play]]\", \"Damned If I Do\", \"Time\" (the first single to feature Woolfson's lead vocal) and \"[[Eye in the Sky (song)|Eye in the Sky]]\" had a notable impact on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \"[[Don't Answer Me]]\" became the Project's last successful single in the United States; it reached the top 15 on the American charts in 1984. After those successes, however, the Project began to fade from view. There were fewer hit singles, and declining album sales. 1987's ''[[Gaudi (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Gaudi]]'' would be the Project's final release, though it had planned to record an album called ''[[Freudiana]]'' (1990) next.\n\n==== The musical ''Freudiana'' ====\nEven though the studio version of ''Freudiana'' was produced by Parsons (and featured the regular Project backing musicians, making it an 'unofficial' Project album), it was primarily Woolfson's idea to turn it into a musical. This eventually led to a rift between the two artists. While Parsons pursued his own solo career and took many members of the Project on the road for the first time in a successful worldwide tour, Woolfson went on to produce musical plays influenced by the Project's music. ''[[Freudiana]]'', ''Gaudi'', and ''Gambler'' were three musicals that included some Project songs like \"Eye in the Sky\", \"Time\", \"Inside Looking Out\", and \"Limelight\". The live music from ''Gambler'' was only distributed at the performance site in [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]], Germany.\n\n==== ''The Sicilian Defence'' ====\nIn 1979, Parsons, Woolfson, and their [[record label]] Arista, had been stalled in contract renegotiations when the two submitted an all-instrumental album tentatively titled '[[The Sicilian Defence (The Alan Parsons Project)|The Sicilian Defence]]', named after an [[Sicilian Defence|aggressive opening move]] in chess, arguably to get out of their [[recording contract]]. Arista's refusal to release the album had two known effects: the negotiations led to a renewed contract, and the album was not released at that time.\n\n{{quote|''The Sicilian Defence'' was our attempt at quickly fulfilling our contractual obligation after ''I Robot'', ''Pyramid'', and ''Eve'' had been delivered. The album was rejected by Arista, not surprisingly, and we then renegotiated our deal for the future and the next album, ''The Turn of a Friendly Card''.

Sometime later, after he had relocated the original tapes, Parsons had completely changed his mind about the album and announced that it would finally be released on an upcoming Project box set called ''The Complete Albums Collection'' in 2014 for the first time as a bonus disc.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/02/14/alan-parsons-project-tour-on-the-road-again/1914601/|title=Alan Parsons on the road again|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=8 June 2013|first=Brian|last=Mansfield|date=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Alan Parsons's solo career ==\nParsons released titles under his name; these were ''[[Try Anything Once]]'' (1993), ''[[On Air (Alan Parsons album)|On Air]]'' (1996), ''[[The Time Machine (Alan Parsons album)|The Time Machine]]'' (1999), and ''[[A Valid Path]]'' (2004). Meanwhile, Woolfson made [[concept album]]s titled ''[[Freudiana]]'' (1990), about [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[psychology]], and ''[[Poe: More Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' (2003); this continued from the Alan Parsons Project's first album about Edgar Allan Poe's literature.\n\n''Tales of Mystery and Imagination'' (1976) was first [[remix]]ed in 1987 for release on CD, and included narration by [[Orson Welles]] which had been recorded in 1975, but arrived too late to be included on the original album. On the 2007 deluxe edition release, it is revealed that parts of this tape were used for the 1976 Griffith Park Planetarium launch of the original album, the 1987 remix, and various radio spots, all of which were included as bonus material.\n\n== Sound ==\n\"[[Sirius (instrumental)|Sirius]]\", eventually became the best-known, or, at least, the most frequently heard, of all Parsons songs. It was used as entrance music by various American sports teams, most notably by the [[Chicago Bulls]] during their 1990s [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]]. It was also used as the entrance theme for [[Ricky Steamboat]] in pro wrestling of the mid-1980s. In addition, \"Sirius\" has been played in a variety of TV shows and movies including the episode \"Vanishing Act\" of ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'' and the 2009 film ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]''.\n\nLead vocal duties were shared by guest vocalists chosen by their style to complement each song. In later years, Woolfson sang lead on many of the group's hits, including \"Time\", \"Eye in the Sky\", and \"Don't Answer Me\". The record company pressured Parsons to use him more. However, Parsons preferred to use more technically polished and proficient singers, which Woolfson admitted he was not. In addition to Woolfson, vocalists [[Chris Rainbow]], [[Lenny Zakatek]], [[John Miles (musician)|John Miles]], [[David Paton]], and [[Colin Blunstone]] made regular appearances.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Other singers, such as [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], Steve Harley, [[Gary Brooker]], [[Elmer Gantry\u2019s Velvet Opera|Dave Terry a.k.a. Elmer Gantry]], [[Vitamin Z]]'s Geoff Barradale, and [[Marmalade (band)|Marmalade]]'s Dean Ford, have recorded only once or twice with the Project. Parsons himself only sang lead on one song (\"[[The Raven (song)|The Raven]]\") through a [[vocoder]] and backing on a few others, including \"To One in Paradise\". Both of those songs appeared on ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)|Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' (1976).\n\nA small number of musicians worked with the Alan Parsons Project regularly. These core musicians contributed to the recognisable style of a Project song in spite of the varied singer line-up. Together with Parsons and Woolfson, the Project originally consisted of the group [[Pilot (band)|Pilot]], with [[Ian Bairnson]] (guitar), [[David Paton]] (bass) and [[Stuart Tosh]] (drums).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Pilot's keyboardist [[Billy Lyall]] also contributed. From ''[[Pyramid (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Pyramid]]'' (1978) onwards, Tosh was replaced by [[Stuart Elliott (drummer)|Stuart Elliott]] of [[Cockney Rebel]]. Bairnson played on all albums, and Paton stayed almost until the end. [[Andrew Powell]] appeared as arranger of orchestra (and often choirs) on all albums except ''[[Vulture Culture]]'' (1985), when he was composing the [[film score|score]] of [[Richard Donner]]'s film ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'' (1985). This score was partly in the Project style, recorded by most of the Project regulars, and produced and engineered by Parsons. Powell also composed some material for the first two Project albums. From ''Vulture Culture'' onwards, Richard Cottle played as a regular member on synthesizers and saxophone.\n\n[[File:Alan Parsons live.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Alan Parsons Live Project, June 1998 (distinct from the Alan Parsons Project live)]]\nExcept for one occasion, the Project never played live during its original incarnation. This was because Woolfson and Parsons saw themselves mainly in the roles of writing and production, and also because of the technical difficulties of reproducing on stage the complex instrumentation used in the studio. In the 1990s things changed with the technology of [[digital sampler]]s. The one occasion where the band was introduced as 'The Alan Parsons Project' in a live performance was at [[Night of the Proms]] in October 1990 (at the time of the group's break-up), featuring all Project regulars except Woolfson, who was present but behind the scenes, while Parsons stayed at the mixer except during the last song, where he played acoustic guitar.\n\nSince 1993, a new version of the band has toured, with Parsons performing live acoustic guitar, keyboards and vocals, with various line-ups. This latest incarnation was called '''Alan Parsons''', later renamed the '''Alan Parsons Live Project''' to be distinct from 'The Alan Parsons Project', due to founder Parsons' break-up with Woolfson. The band currently features lead singer [[P.J. Olsson]], guitarist [[Jeffrey Kollman]], drummer Danny Thompson, keyboardist [[Tom Brooks (music producer)|Tom Brooks]], bass guitarist [[Guy Erez]], vocalist and saxophonist Todd Cooper, and guitarist and vocalist Dan Tracey. In 2013, Alan Parsons Live Project played [[Colombia]] with a full choir and orchestra (the [[Medellin]] Philharmonic) as 'Alan Parsons Symphonic Project'. A 2-CD live set and a DVD version of this concert were released in May 2016.\n\n== Members ==\n;Official members\n* [[Alan Parsons]] \u2013 production, [[Audio engineering|engineering]], programming, composition, keyboards\n* [[Eric Woolfson]] \u2013 composition, lyrics, keyboards, vocals, [[Music executive|executive production]]\n\n\n;Notable contributors\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n\n\n* [[Ian Bairnson]] \u2013 guitar\n* [[Andrew Powell]] \u2013 composition, keyboards, orchestral arrangements<ref>[http://www.the-alan-parsons-project.com/otherapp01.html John Miles, Laurence Cottle, Ian Bairnson, Contributed to The Alan Parsons Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031025040/http://www.the-alan-parsons-project.com/otherapp01.html |date=31 October 2007 }}</ref>\n* [[Philharmonia Orchestra]]\n* The English Chorale - vocals\n* [[David Paton]] \u2013 bass, vocals\n* [[Stuart Elliott (drummer)|Stuart Elliott]] \u2013 drums, percussion\n* [[Stuart Tosh]] \u2013 drums, percussion\n* Richard Cottle \u2013 keyboards, saxophone\n* [[Laurence Cottle]] \u2013 bass\n* [[Duncan Mackay (musician)|Duncan Mackay]] \u2013 keyboards\n* Ian Holmes \u2013 keyboards\n* [[Mel Collins]] \u2013 saxophone\n* [[Lenny Zakatek]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Chris Rainbow]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Geoff Barradale]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[John Miles (musician)|John Miles]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Colin Blunstone]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Jaki Whitren]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Peter Straker]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Elmer Gantry\u2019s Velvet Opera|Dave Terry (\"Elmer Gantry\")]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Jack Harris (musician)|Jack Harris]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Graham Dye]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Steven Dye]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Dave Townsend]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Gary Brooker]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Allan Clarke (singer)|Allan Clarke]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[David Pack]] \u2013 guitar, vocals\n* [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Dean Ford]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Clare Torry]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Lesley Duncan]] \u2013 vocals\n}}\n\n== Discography ==\n{{Main|The Alan Parsons Project discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n* ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)|Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[I Robot (album)|I Robot]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Pyramid (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Pyramid]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Eve (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Eve]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[The Turn of a Friendly Card]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Eye in the Sky (album)|Eye in the Sky]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Ammonia Avenue]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Vulture Culture]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Stereotomy]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[Gaudi (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Gaudi]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[Freudiana]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[The Sicilian Defence (album)|The Sicilian Defence]]'' (2014)\n\n=== Important compilations ===\n* ''[[The Best of The Alan Parsons Project (1983 album)|The Best of The Alan Parsons Project]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[The Best of The Alan Parsons Project, Vol. 2]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[The Instrumental Works]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[The Definitive Collection (Alan Parsons album)|The Definitive Collection]]'' (1997; includes 2 tracks from Parsons' 1993 album ''[[Try Anything Once]]'')\n* ''[[The Essential Alan Parsons Project]]'' (2007; remastered; released in some countries as \"Days are Numbers\" or \"The Dutch Collection\")\n\n== Related ==\n* ''The [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] Plays the Best of The Alan Parsons Project'' (1983 \u2013 orchestral album by Andrew Powell)\n* ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'' (1985 \u2013 soundtrack by Powell, produced and engineered by Parsons)\n* ''Black Freudiana'' (1991 \u2013 Austrian Original Cast Musical Soundtrack, virtually a solo Woolfson project)\n\n== In popular culture ==\n''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode        \"[[Homerpalooza]]\" features Homer explaining 1970s rock music to Lisa, Bart and Milhouse: \"[[Grand Funk Railroad]] paved the way for [[Jefferson Airplane]], which cleared the way for [[Jefferson Starship]].

The meaning of \"negligible\" depends on the mathematical context; for instance, it can mean [[finite set|finite]], [[countable set|countable]], or [[null set|null]].\n\nIn contrast, \"'''almost no'''\" means \"a negligible amount\"; that is, \"almost no elements of <var>X</var>\" means \"the elements of some negligible subset of <var>X</var>\".\n\n==Meanings in areas of mathematics==\n===Prevalent meaning===\n{{further|Cofinite set}}\nThroughout mathematics, \"almost all\" is sometimes used to mean \"all (elements of an [[infinite set]]) but [[finite set|finite]]ly many\".{{r|Cahen1|Cahen2|Halmos}} This use occurs in philosophy as well.{{r|Gardenfors}} Similarly, \"almost all\" can mean \"all (elements of an [[uncountable set]]) but [[countable set|countably]] many\".{{r|Schwartzman|group=sec}}\n\nExamples:\n* Almost all positive integers are greater than 1,000,000,000,000.{{r|Courant|page=293}}\n* Almost all [[prime number]]s are odd, as 2 is the only exception.\n* Almost all [[polyhedra]] are [[regular polyhedron#The regular polyhedra|irregular]], as there are only nine exceptions: the five [[platonic solid]]s and the four [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].\n* If <var>P</var> is a [[zero polynomial|nonzero]] polynomial, <var>P(x)</var>&ne;0 for almost all <var>x</var>.\n\n===Meaning in measure theory===\n{{further|Almost everywhere}}\n[[File:CantorEscalier.svg|thumb|right|250px| The Cantor function]]\n\nWhen speaking about the [[real number|reals]], sometimes \"almost all\" means \"all reals but a [[null set]]\".{{r|Korevaar|Natanson}}{{r|Clapham|group=sec}} Similarly, if <var>S</var> is some set of reals, \"almost all numbers in <var>S</var>\" can mean \"all numbers in <var>S</var> but those in a null set\".{{r|Sohrab}} The [[real line]] can be thought of as a one-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. In the more general case of an <var>n</var>-dimensional space (where <var>n</var> is a positive integer), these definitions can be [[generalised]] to \"all points but those in a null set\"{{r|James|group=sec}} or \"all points in <var>S</var> but those in a null set\" (this time, <var>S</var> is a set of points in the space).{{r|Helmberg}} Even more generally, \"almost all\" is sometimes used in the sense of \"[[almost everywhere]]\" in [[measure theory]],{{r|Vestrup|Billingsley}}{{r|Bityutskov|group=sec}} or in the closely related sense of \"[[almost surely]]\" in [[probability theory]].{{r|Billingsley}}{{r|Ito2|group=sec}}\n\nExamples:\n* In a [[measure space]], such as the real line, countable sets are null. The set of [[rational number]]s is countable, and thus almost all real numbers are irrational.{{r|Niven}}\n* As [[Georg Cantor]] proved in [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|his first set theory article]], the set of [[algebraic number]]s is countable as well, so almost all reals are [[transcendental number|transcendental]].{{r|Baker}}\n* Almost all reals are [[normal number|normal]].{{r|Granville}}\n* The [[Cantor set]] is null as well. Thus, almost all reals are not members of it even though it is uncountable.{{r|Korevaar}}\n* The derivative of the [[Cantor function]] is 0 for almost all numbers in the [[unit interval]].{{r|Burk}} It follows from the previous example because the Cantor function is [[locally constant function|locally constant]]&mdash;and thus with derivative 0&mdash;outside the Cantor set.\n\n===Meaning in number theory===\n{{further|Asymptotically almost surely}}\nIn [[number theory]], \"almost all positive integers\" can mean \"the positive integers in a set whose [[natural density]] is 1\". That is, if <var>A</var> is a set of positive integers, and if the proportion of positive integers below <var>n</var> that are in <var>A</var> (out of all positive integers below <var>n</var>) [[limit of a sequence|tends to]] 1 as <var>n</var> tends to infinity, then almost all positive integers are in <var>A</var>.{{r|Hardy1|Hardy2}}{{r|Weisstein|group=sec}} More generally, let <var>S</var> be an infinite set of positive integers, such as the set of even positive numbers or of [[prime number|primes]].

Therefore, the proportion of primes is roughly ln(<var>n</var>)/<var>n</var>, which tends to 0 as <var>n</var> tends to [[infinity]], so the proportion of composite numbers less than or equal to <var>n</var> tends to 1 as <var>n</var> tends to [[infinity]].{{r|Hardy2}}}}\n* Almost all even positive numbers can be expressed as the sum of two primes.{{r|Courant|page=489}}\n* Almost all primes are [[twin prime#Isolated prime|isolated]]. Moreover, for every positive integer <var>g</var>, almost all primes have [[prime gap]]s of more than <var>g</var> both to their left and to their right (no other primes between <var>p+g</var> and <var>p-g)</var>.{{r|Prachar}}\n\n===Meaning in graph theory===\nIn [[graph theory]], if <var>A</var> is a set of (finite [[graph labeling|labelled]]) [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, it can be said to contain almost all graphs if the proportion of graphs with <var>n</var> vertices that are in <var>A</var> tends to 1 as <var>n</var> tends to infinity.{{r|Babai}} However, it is sometimes easier to work with probabilities,{{r|Spencer}} so the definition is reformulated as follows. The proportion of graphs with <var>n</var> vertices that are in <var>A</var> equals the probability that a random graph with <var>n</var> vertices (chosen with the [[discrete uniform distribution|uniform distribution]]) is in <var>A</var>, and choosing a graph in this way has the same outcome as generating a graph by flipping a coin for each pair of vertices to decide whether to connect them.{{r|Bollobas}} Therefore, equivalently to the preceding definition, <var>A</var> contains almost all graphs if the probability that a coin flip-generated graph with <var>n</var> vertices is in <var>A</var> tends to 1 as <var>n</var> tends to infinity.{{r|Spencer|Gradel}} Sometimes the latter definition is modified so that the graph is chosen randomly in some [[random graph#Models|other way]], where not all graphs with <var>n</var> vertices have the same probability,{{r|Bollobas}} and those modified definitions are not always equivalent to the main one.\n\nThe use of the term \"almost all\" in graph theory is not standard; the term \"[[asymptotically almost surely]]\" is more commonly used for this concept.{{r|Spencer}}\n\nExample:\n* Almost all graphs are [[asymmetric graph|asymmetric]].{{r|Babai}}\n* Almost all graphs have [[diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] 2.{{r|Buckley}}\n\n===Meaning in topology===\nIn [[topology]]{{r|Oxtoby}} and especially [[dynamical systems theory]]{{r|Baratchart|Broer|Sharkovsky}} (including applications in economics),{{r|Yuan}} \"almost all\" of a [[topological space]]'s points can mean \"all of the space's points but those in a [[meagre set]]\". Some use a more limited definition, where a subset only contains almost all of the space's points if it contains some [[open set|open]] [[dense set]].{{r|Broer|Albertini|Fuente}}\n\nExample:\n* Given an [[hyperconnected space|irreducible]] [[algebraic variety]], the [[property (mathematics)|properties]] that hold for almost all points in the variety are exactly the [[generic property|generic properties]].{{r|Ito1|group=sec}} It is because in an irreducible algebraic variety equipped with the [[Zariski topology]], all nonempty open sets are dense.\n\n===Meaning in algebra===\nIn [[abstract algebra]] and [[mathematical logic]], if <var>U</var> is an [[ultrafilter#Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set|ultrafilter]] on a set <var>X</var>, \"almost all elements of <var>X</var>\" sometimes means \"the elements of some ''element'' of <var>U</var>\".{{r|Komjath|Salzmann|Schoutens|Rautenberg}} For any [[partition of a set|partition]] of <var>X</var> into two [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] sets, one of them necessarily contains almost all elements of <var>X</var>.

In contrast, [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] hydrocarbons lack this delocalization. The term \"aromatic\" was assigned before the physical mechanism determining [[aromaticity]] was discovered; the term was coined as such simply because many of the compounds have a sweet or pleasant odour. The configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring, after the simplest possible such hydrocarbon, [[benzene]]. Aromatic hydrocarbons can be ''monocyclic'' (MAH) or ''polycyclic'' (PAH).\n\nSome non-benzene-based compounds called '''heteroarenes''', which follow [[H\u00fcckel's rule]] (for monocyclic rings: when the number of its \u03c0 electrons equals 4''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2, where ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, 1, 2, 3, ...), are also called aromatic compounds. In these compounds, at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of the [[heteroatom]]s [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], or [[sulfur]]. Examples of non-benzene compounds with aromatic properties are [[furan]], a heterocyclic compound with a five-membered ring that includes a single oxygen atom, and [[pyridine]], a heterocyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-aromatic.html HighBeam Encyclopedia: aromatic compound].</ref>\n\n== Benzene ring model ==\n[[Image:Benzene circle.svg|100px|right|thumb| [[Benzene]] ]]\n{{main|aromaticity}}\n[[Benzene]], C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon, and it was the first one named as such. The nature of its bonding was first recognized by [[August Kekul\u00e9]] in the 19th century. Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One goes to the hydrogen atom, and one to each of the two neighbouring carbons. This leaves one electron to share with one of the two neighbouring carbon atoms, thus creating a double bond with one carbon and leaving a single bond with the other, which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon.\n\nThe structure is alternatively illustrated as a circle around the inside of the ring to show six electrons floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This depiction represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon\u2013carbon bonds all of [[bond order]] 1.5; the equivalency is explained by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance form]]s. The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat.\n\nGeneral properties of aromatic hydrocarbons:\n\n# They display [[aromaticity]]\n# The carbon\u2013hydrogen ratio is high\n# They burn with a strong sooty yellow flame because of the high carbon\u2013hydrogen ratio\n# They undergo [[electrophilic substitution reaction]]s and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]]s\n\nThe circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Sir Robert Robinson]] and his student James Armit in 1925<ref>{{cite journal|first1=James Wilkins |last1=Armit |first2=Robert |last2=Robinson|author2-link=Robert Robinson (organic chemist) |date=1925 |title=Polynuclear heterocyclic aromatic types. Part II. Some anhydronium bases |journal=[[J. Chem. Soc. Trans.]] |volume=127 |pages=1604\u20131618}}</ref> and popularized starting in 1959 by the Morrison & Boyd textbook on organic chemistry. The proper use of the symbol is debated; it is used to describe any cyclic \u03c0 system in some publications, or only those \u03c0 systems that obey [[H\u00fcckel's rule]] in others. Jensen<ref>{{cite journal|first=William B. |last=Jensen |date=April 2009 |url=http://www.che.uc.edu/jensen/W.%20B.%20Jensen/Reprints/157.%20Aromaticity%20Circle.pdf |title=The circle symbol for aromaticity |journal=[[J. Chem. Educ.]] |volume=86|issue=4 |pages=423\u2013424|bibcode=2009JChEd..86..423J |doi=10.1021/ed086p423 }}</ref> argues that, in line with Robinson's original proposal, the use of the circle symbol should be limited to monocyclic 6 \u03c0-electron systems. In this way the circle symbol for a six-center six-electron bond can be compared to the Y symbol for a [[three-center two-electron bond]].\n\n==Arene synthesis==\nA reaction that forms an arene compound from an unsaturated or partially unsaturated cyclic precursor is simply called an '''[[aromatization]]'''. Many laboratory methods exist for the [[organic synthesis]] of arenes from non-arene precursors. Many methods rely on [[cycloaddition]] reactions. [[Alkyne trimerization]] describes the [2+2+2] cyclization of three alkynes, in the [[D\u00f6tz reaction]] an alkyne, carbon monoxide and a chromium carbene complex are the reactants. [[Diels\u2013Alder reaction]]s of [[alkyne]]s with [[pyrone]] or [[cyclopentadienone]] with expulsion of [[carbon dioxide]] or carbon monoxide also form arene compounds. In [[Bergman cyclization]] the reactants are an [[enyne]] plus a hydrogen donor.\n\nAnother set of methods is the aromatization of [[cyclohexane]]s and other aliphatic rings: reagents are catalysts used in [[hydrogenation]] such as platinum, palladium and nickel (reverse hydrogenation), [[quinone]]s and the elements [[sulfur]] and [[selenium]].<ref>{{March3rd}}</ref>\n\n==Arene reactions==\nArenes are reactants in many organic reactions.\n\n===Aromatic substitution===\nIn aromatic substitution one [[substituent]] on the arene ring, usually hydrogen, is replaced by another substituent.

In [[radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] the active reagent is a radical. An example of electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nitration of [[salicylic acid]]:<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1016/0040-4039(95)00281-G\n| title = A mild oxidation of aromatic amines\n| year = 1995\n| last2 = Seneviratne | first2 = V.\n| last1 = Webb | first1 = K.\n| journal = Tetrahedron Letters\n| volume = 36\n| issue = 14\n| pages = 2377\u20132378 \n}}</ref>\n:[[File:Synthesis 5-Nitrosalicylic acid.svg|400px|Nitration of salicylic acid]]\n\n===Coupling reactions===\nIn [[coupling reaction]]s a metal catalyses a coupling between two formal radical fragments.

Examples of benzene compounds with just one substituent are [[phenol]], which carries a [[hydroxyl]] group, and [[toluene]] with a [[methyl]] group. When there is more than one substituent present on the ring,  their spatial relationship becomes important for which the [[arene substitution patterns]] ''ortho'', ''meta'', and ''para'' are devised. For example, three [[isomer]]s exist for [[cresol]] because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group can be placed next to each other (''ortho''), one position removed from each other (''meta''), or two positions removed from each other (''para''). [[Xylenol]] has two methyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group, and, for this structure, 6 isomers exist.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Representative arene compounds\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:toluene.svg|[[Toluene]]\nFile:Ethylbenzene-2D-skeletal.png|[[Ethylbenzene]]\nFile:Para-Xylol - para-xylene.svg|[[Xylene|''p''-Xylene]]\nFile:Meta-Xylol_-_meta-xylene_2.svg|[[Xylene|''m''-Xylene]]\nFile:1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene.svg| [[Mesitylene]]\nFile:Durene.png| [[Durene]]\nFile:2-phenyl-hexane.png| [[2-Phenylhexane]]\nFile:Bifenyl.svg| [[Biphenyl]] \nFile:Phenol-2D-skeletal.png|[[Phenol]]\nFile:Aniline.svg|[[Aniline]]\nFile:Nitrobenzol.svg|[[Nitrobenzene]]\nFile:Benzoic acid.svg|[[Benzoic acid]]\nFile:Aspirin-skeletal.svg|[[Aspirin]]\nFile:Paracetamol-skeletal.svg|[[Paracetamol]]\nFile:Pikrins\u00e4ure.svg|[[Picric acid]]\n\n</gallery>\n\nThe arene ring has an ability to stabilize charges.

It provides a place for religious activities, work, and housing of [[Christian]] [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s. The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them. Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. An abbey may be the home of an [[enclosed religious order]] or may be open to visitors. The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted, or education to the young. Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking [[retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]]. There are many famous abbeys across [[Europe]].\n\n== Monastic origins of the abbey ==\n{{Main article|Monasticism}}\n\n=== Ascetics and anchorites ===\nThe earliest known Christian monasteries were groups of huts built near the residence of a famous [[ascetic]] or other holy person. Disciples wished to be close to their holy man or woman in order to study their doctrine or imitate their way of life.<ref name=birt>{{harvnb|Birt|1907}}</ref>\n\nIn the earliest times of Christian monasticism, ascetics would live in social isolation but near a village church. They would subsist whilst donating any excess produce to the poor. However, increasing religious fervor about the ascetic's ways and or persecution of them would drive them further away from their community and further into solitude. For instance, the cells and huts of [[anchorite]]s (religious recluses) have been found in the deserts of [[Egypt]].<ref>https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Encyclop\u00e6dia_Britannica,_Ninth_Edition,_v._1.djvu/26{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 312 AD, [[Anthony the Great]] retired to the [[Thebaid]] region of [[Egypt]] to escape the persecution of the Emperor [[Maximian]]. Anthony was the best known of the anchorites of his time due to his degree of austerity, sanctity and his powers of [[exorcism]]. The deeper he withdrew into the wilderness, the more numerous his disciples became. They refused to be separated from him and built their cells close to him. This became a first true monastic community. Anthony, according to [[Johann August Wilhelm Neander]], inadvertently became the founder of a new mode of living in common, [[Cenobitic|Coenobitism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Venables|1911}} cites  ''Church History'', iii. p. 316, Clark's translation.</ref>\n\n=== Laurae and caenobia ===\n{{Main article|Pachomius}}\n\nAt Tabennae on the [[Nile]], in [[Upper Egypt]], Saint [[Pachomius]] laid the foundations for the coenobitical life by arranging everything in an organized manner. He built several monasteries, each with about 1,600 separate cells laid out in lines. These cells formed an encampment where the [[monk]]s slept and performed some of their manual tasks. There were nearby large halls such as the church, refectory, kitchen, infirmary, and guest house for the monk's common needs. An enclosure protecting all these buildings gave the settlement the appearance of a walled village. This layout, known as the ''laurae'' (lanes), became popular throughout [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].\n\nAs well as the \"laurae\", communities known as \"caenobia\" developed. These were monasteries where monks lived a common life together. The monks were not permitted to retire to the cells of a laurae before they had undergone a lengthy period of training. In time, this form of common life superseded that of the older laurae.<ref name=birt/>\n\nIn the late 300s AD, [[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]] visited the Egyptian monasteries. He described three hundred members of the coenobium of [[Panopolis]]. There were fifteen tailors, seven smiths, four carpenters, twelve camel-drivers and fifteen tanners. These people were divided into subgroups, each with its own \"[[oeconomus]]\". A chief steward was at the head of the monastery.\n\nThe produce of the monastery was brought to [[Alexandria]] for sale. The moneys raised were used to purchase stores for the monastery or were given away as charity. Twice in the year, the superiors of several [[Cenobitic monasticism|coenobia]] met at the chief monastery, under the presidency of an \"[[archimandrite]]\" (the \"chief of the fold\" from the word, \"miandra\" (a sheepfold)) in order to make their reports. [[Chrysostom]] recorded the workings of a coenobia in the vicinity of [[Antioch]]. The monks lived in separate huts (\"kalbbia\") which formed a religious hamlet on the mountainside. They were subject to an abbot, and observed a common rule.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n=== Great Lavra, Mount Athos ===\n{| align=\"right\"\n|+ '''Great Lavra Monastery, Mount Athos<br>(Lenoir, who named it ''Santa Laura'')'''{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n|-\n| [[File:abbey 01.png]] ||\n:A.

Tower\n|}\nThe layout of the monastic coenobium was influenced by a number of factors. These included a need for defence, economy of space, and convenience of access. The layout of buildings became compact and orderly. Larger buildings were erected and defence was provided by strong outside walls. Within the walls, the buildings were arranged around one or more open courts surrounded by [[cloister]]s. The usual arrangement for monasteries of the [[Eastern world]] is exemplified in the plan of the convent of the [[Great Lavra]] at [[Mount Athos]].\n\nWith reference to the diagram, right, the convent of the [[Great Lavra]] is enclosed within a strong and lofty blank stone wall. The area within the wall is between three and four acres (12,000 and 16,000&nbsp;m\u00b2). The longer side is about {{convert|500|ft|m}} in length. There is only one entrance, which is located on the north side (A), defended by three iron doors. Near the entrance is a large tower (M), a constant feature in the monasteries of the [[Levant]] (Eastern [[Mediterranean]] area). There is a small [[postern]] gate at L.\n\nThe [[enceinte]] comprises two large open courts, surrounded with buildings connected with cloister galleries of wood or stone. The outer court, which is the larger by far, contains the [[granary|granaries]] and storehouses (K), the kitchen (H) and other offices connected with the [[refectory]] (G). Immediately adjacent to the gateway is a two-storied guest-house, entered from a cloister (C). The inner court is surrounded by a cloister (EE) from which one enters the monks' cells (II).\n\nIn the centre of this court stands the [[katholikon]] or conventual church, a square building with an [[apse]] of the cruciform domical [[Byzantine]] type, approached by a domed [[narthex]]. In front of the church stands a marble fountain (F), covered by a dome supported on columns.\n\nOpening from the western side of the cloister, but actually standing in the outer court, is the refectory (G), a large cruciform (cross shaped) building, about {{convert|100|ft|m}} square, decorated within with [[fresco]]es of saints. At the upper end is a semicircular recess, similar to the [[triclinium]] of the [[Lateran Palace]] in [[Rome]], in which is placed the seat of the [[hegumenos]] or abbot. This apartment is chiefly used as a meeting place, with the monks usually taking their meals in their separate cells.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n=== Adoption of the Roman villa plan ===\nMonasticism in the [[Western world|West]] began with the activities of [[Benedict of Nursia]] (born 480 AD). Near [[Nursia]], a town in [[Perugia]], [[Italy]], a first abbey was established at [[Monte Cassino]] (529 AD).<ref name=EB/> Between 520 and 700 AD, monasteries were built which were spacious and splendid. All the [[city state]]s of [[Italy]] hosted a [[Benedictine]] convent as did the cities of [[England]], [[France]] and [[Spain]]. By 1415 AD, the time of the [[Council of Constance]], 15,070 Benedictine monasteries had been established.\n\nThe early Benedictine monasteries, including the first at Monte Cassino, were constructed on the plan of the [[Roman villa]]. The layout of the Roman villa was quite consistent throughout the [[Roman Empire]] and where possible, the monks reused available villas in sound repair. This was done at Monte Cassino.\n\nHowever, over time, changes to the common villa lay out occurred. The monks required buildings which suited their religious and day-to-day activities. No overriding specification was demanded of the monks but the similarity of their needs resulted in uniformity of design of abbeys across Europe.<ref name=birt/> Eventually, the buildings of a Benedictine abbey were built in a uniform lay out, modified where necessary, to accommodate local circumstances.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n=== Abbey of St Gall ===\n[[File:Abbey st gall 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The church of the Abbey of St Gall]]\n\nThe plan of the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]] (719 AD) indicates the general arrangement of a [[Benedictine]] monastery of its day. According to the architect [[Robert Willis (architect)]] (1800\u20131875) the Abbey's lay out is that of a town of individual houses with streets running between them. The abbey was planned in compliance with the Benedictine rule that, if possible, a monastery should be self-contained. For instance, there was a mill, a [[bakehouse]], [[stable]]s, and [[cattle]] stalls.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} In all, there were thirty-three separate structures; mostly one level wooden buildings.\n\nThe Abbey church occupied the centre of a quadrangular area, about {{convert|430|ft|m}} square. On the eastern side of the north transept of the church was the \"[[scriptorium]]\" or writing-room, with a library above.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nThe church and nearby buildings ranged about the [[cloister]], a court about which there was a covered arcade which allowed sheltered movement between the buildings. The [[nave]] of the church was on the north boundary of the cloister.\n\nOn the east side of the cloister, on the ground floor, was the \"[[pisalis]]\" or \"[[calefactory]]\". This was a common room, warmed by flues beneath the floor. Above the common room was the [[dormitory]]. The dormitory opened onto the cloister and also onto the south transept of the church. This enabled the monks to attend nocturnal services.<ref name=\"EB\" /> A passage at the other end of the dormitory lead to the \"[[necessarium]]\" (latrines).\n\nOn the south side of the cloister was the refectory. The kitchen, at the west end of the refectory was accessed via an anteroom and a long passage. Nearby were the bake house, brew house and the sleeping-rooms of the servants. The upper story of the refectory was called the \"vestiarium\" (a room where the ordinary clothes of the monks were stored).\n\nOn the western side of the cloister was another two-story building with a [[Semi-basement|cellar]] on the ground floor and the [[larder]] and store-room on the upper floor. Between this building and the church was a parlour for receiving visitors. One door of the parlour led to the cloisters and the other led to the outer part of the Abbey.\n\nAgainst the outer wall of the church was a school and headmaster's house. The school consisted of a large schoolroom divided in the middle by a screen or partition, and surrounded by fourteen little rooms, the \"dwellings of the scholars\". The abbott's home was near the school.\n\nTo the north of the church and to the right of the main entrance to the Abbey, was a residence for distinguished guests. To the left of the main entrance was a building to house poor travellers and [[pilgrim]]s. There was also a building to receive visiting monks. These \"[[hospitia]]\" had a large common room or refectory surrounded by bed rooms. Each hospitium had its own brewhouse and bakehouse, and the building for more prestigious travellers had a kitchen and storeroom, with bedrooms for the guests' servants and stables for their horses.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} The monks of the Abbey lived in a house built against the north wall of the church.\n\nThe whole of the southern and western areas of the Abbey were devoted to workshops, stables and farm-buildings including stables, ox-sheds, goatstables, piggeries, and sheep-folds, as well as the servants' and labourers' quarters.\n\nIn the eastern part of the Abbey there was a group of buildings representing in layout, two complete miniature monasteries. That is, each had a covered cloister surrounded by the usual buildings such as the church, the refectory, the dormitory and so on. A detached building belonging to each contained a bathroom and a kitchen.\n\nOne of the miniature complexes was called the \"oblati\". These were the buildings for the novices. The other complex was a hospital or infirmary for the care of sick monks. This infirmary complex included a physician's residence, a [[physic garden]], a drug store, and a chamber for the critically ill. There was also a room for bloodletting and purging. The physic garden occupied the north east corner of the Abbey.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nIn the southern most area of the abbey was the workshop containing utilities for [[shoemaker]]s, saddlers (or shoemakers, sellarii), cutlers and grinders, [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]]-makers, [[Tanner (occupation)|tanners]], curriers, fullers, [[Smith (metalwork)|smiths]] and [[goldsmith]]s. The tradesmen's living quarters were at the rear of the workshop. Here, there were also farm buildings, a large granary and threshing-floor, mills, and malthouse. At the south-east corner of the Abbey were hen and duck houses, a poultry-yard, and the dwelling of the keeper. Nearby was the kitchen garden which complemented the physic garden and a cemetery [[orchard]].{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nEvery large monastery had [[priory|priories]]. A priory was a smaller structure or entities which depended on the monastery. Some were small monasteries accommodating five or ten monks. Others were no more than a single building serving as residence or a farm offices. The outlying farming establishments belonging to the monastic foundations were known as \"villae\" or \"granges\". They were usually staffed by [[lay-brothers]], sometimes under the supervision of a monk.\n\n== Benedictine abbeys in England ==\n[[File:Shrewsbury Abbey Exterior, Shropshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Shrewsbury Abbey]]\nMany of today's [[cathedral]]s in [[England]] were originally Benedictine monasteries.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Abbey|edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=11\u201312}}</ref> These included [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]], [[Chester Cathedral|Chester]], [[Durham Cathedral|Durham]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]], [[Norwich Cathedral|Norwich]], [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]], [[Rochester Cathedral|Rochester]], [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]], and [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]].<ref name=Colliers>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Newcomb|first1=Rexford|editor-first=Bernard|editor-last=Johnston|encyclopedia=Collier's Encyclopedia |title=Abbey|edition=First |year=1997|publisher=P.F.

A small cloister lay to the south-east of the large cloister. Beyond that was an infirmary with a table hall and a refectory for those who were able to leave their chambers.

The Abbey was built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. The Abbey was noted for its strict observance of the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]]. However, reforms resulted in many departures from this precedent. The [[Cluniac reforms]] brought focus to the traditions of monastic life, encouraging art and the caring of the poor. The Cluniac reforms quickly spread by the founding of new abbey complexes and also by adoption of the reforms by existing abbeys. By the twelfth century, the [[Abbey of Cluny]] was the head of an order consisting of 314 monasteries.<ref name=Alston>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04073a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Congregation of Cluny|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706160053/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04073a.htm|archivedate=6 July 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe church at the Abbey was commenced in 1089 AD by [[St. Hugh]], the sixth abbot. It was finished and consecrated by [[Pope Innocent II]] around 1132 AD. The church was regarded as one of the wonders of the [[Middle Ages]]. At {{convert|555|ft}} in length, it was the largest church in [[Christendom]] until the completion of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] at Rome. The church consisted of five naves, a [[narthex]] (ante-church) which was added in 1220 AD, and several towers. Together with the conventual buildings, it covered an area of twenty-five acres.\n\nIn the [[Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution]] in 1790 AD, the Abbey church was bought by the town and almost entirely destroyed.<ref name=Alston/>\n\n=== English Cluniac houses ===\n[[File:Paisley Abbey Interior East.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Interior facing east, Paisley Abbey]]\nThe first English house of the Cluniac order was built at [[Lewes]], [[Sussex]]. It was founded by [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey]] in about 1077 AD. All but one of the [[Cluniac houses in Britain]] were known as [[Priory|priories]], symbolizing their subordination to the [[Abbey of Cluny]]. All the Cluniac houses in England and Scotland were French colonies, governed by French priors who travelled to the [[Abbey of Cluny]] to consult or be consulted (unless the abbot of Cluny chose to come to Britain, which happened rarely). The priory at [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] was an exception. In 1245 AD it was raised to the status of an abbey, answerable only to the Pope.\n\n== Abbeys of the Austin Canons ==<!--Engelbert_M%C3%BChlbacher links here-->\n[[File:StBotolph'sPriory Colchester.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The nave of St. Botolph's Priory, Colchester]]\nThe Austin [[canon (priest)|canons]] were an order of [[regular clergy]] within the hierarchy of the [[Catholic church]]. They held a position between monks and secular canons. They were known as \"Black canons\" because of the colour of their [[habit]]s. In 1105 AD, the first house of the order was established at [[St. Botolph's Priory]], [[Colchester, England|Colchester]], [[Essex]].\n\nThe canons built very long [[nave]]s to accommodate large congregations. The choirs were also long. Sometimes, as at [[Llanthony Priory|Llanthony]] and [[Christchurch, Dorset]](Twynham), the choir was closed from the aisles. At other abbeys of the order, such as [[Bolton Abbey|Bolton]] or [[Kirkham Priory|Kirkham]], there were no aisles. The nave in the northern houses of the order often had only a north aisle (this is the case at Bolton, [[Brinkburn Priory|Brinkburn]] and [[Lanercost Priory|Lanercost]]). The arrangement of the monastic buildings followed the ordinary plan. The prior's lodge was usually attached to the southwest angle of the nave.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nThe Austin canons' house at [[Thornton, Lincolnshire]] had a large and magnificent [[gatehouse]]. The upper floors of the gatehouse formed the guest-house. The chapter-house was octagonal in shape.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n== Augustinian abbeys ==\nThe plan of the Abbey of [[Augustinians|St Augustine's]] at [[Bristol]] (now the [[Bristol Cathedral]]) demonstrates the arrangement of the buildings by this order.

The order was a reformed branch of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian canons]]. From a marshy area in the Forest of Coucy in the [[diocese of Laon]], the order spread widely. Even in Norbert's lifetime, the order had built abbeys in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]] and in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Of the Abbey of Saint Samuel, Denys Pringle wrote, \"The Premonstatensian abbey of Saint Samuel was a daughter house of Pr\u00e9montr\u00e9 itself. Its abbot had the status of a [[suffragan]] of the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|patriarch of Jerusalem]], with the right to a cross, but not to a [[mitre]] nor a ring.\"<ref>Pringle, Denys, ''The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: L-Z (excluding Tyre)'', Cambridge University Press, New York, 1998, p.86</ref> It long maintained its rigid austerity, though in later years the abbey grew wealthier, and its members indulged in more frequent luxuries.\n\nJust after 1140 AD, the Premonstratensians were brought to England. Their first settlement was at [[Newsham Abbey|Newhouse]], [[Lincolnshire]], near the [[Humber]] tidal estuary. There were as many as thirty-five Premonstratensian abbeys in England. The head abbey in England was at [[Welbeck Abbey|Welbeck]] but the best preserved are [[Easby Abbey]] in [[Yorkshire]], and [[Bayham Old Abbey]] in [[Kent]].\n\nThe lay out of [[Easby Abbey]] is irregular due to its position on the edge of a steep river bank. The cloister is duly placed on the south side of the church, and the chief buildings occupy their usual positions around it. However, the cloister garth (quadrangle), as at [[Chichester]], is not rectangular, and thus, all the surrounding buildings are positioned in an awkward fashion. The church follows the plan adopted by the Austin canons in their northern abbeys, and has only one aisle to the north of the nave, while the choir is long, narrow and without an aisle. Each transept has an aisle to the east, forming three chapels.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nThe church at [[Bayham Old Abbey]] had no aisles in the nave or the choir. The latter terminated in a three-sided apse. The church is remarkable for its extreme narrowness in proportion to its length. While the building is {{convert|257|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, it is not more than {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide. Premonstratensian canons did not care to have congregations nor possessions. Therefore, they built their churches in the shape of a long room.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n== Cistercian abbeys ==\n[[File:Abbey-of-senanque-provence-gordes.jpg|thumb|right|Cistercian Abbey of S\u00e9nanque]]\n[[File:Jumi\u00e8ges.jpg|thumb|right| Jumi\u00e8ges Abbey, Normandy]]\n\nThe [[Cistercians]], a Benedictine reform group, were established at [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey|C\u00eeteaux]] in 1098 AD by [[Robert of Molesme]], Abbot of Molesme, for the purpose of restoring, as far as possible, the literal observance of the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]]. La Fert\u00e9, [[Pontigny Abbey|Pontigny]], [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]], and [[Morimond Abbey|Morimond]] were the first four abbeys to follow C\u00eeteaux's example and others followed. The monks of C\u00eeteaux created the well known vineyards of [[Clos de Vougeot|Clos-Vougeot]] and [[Roman\u00e9e-Saint-Vivant|Roman\u00e9e]] in [[Burgundy]].<ref name=gildas>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03792a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Abbey of Citeaux|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713191403/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03792a.htm|archivedate=13 July 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe Cistercian principle of rigid [[Self-denial|self-abnegation]] carried over to the design of the order's churches and buildings. The defining architectural characteristic of the Cistercian abbeys was extreme simplicity and plainness. Only a single, central tower was permitted, and that was usually very low. Unnecessary pinnacles and turrets were prohibited. The [[triforium]] was omitted. The windows were usually plain and undivided, and it was forbidden to decorate them with stained glass. All needless ornament was proscribed. The crosses were made of wood and the candlesticks of iron.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nThe same principle governed the choice of site for Cistercian abbeys in that a most dismal site might be improved by the building of an abbey. The Cistercian monasteries were founded in deep, well-watered valleys, always standing at a stream's edge. The building might extend over the water as is the case at [[Fountains Abbey]]. These valleys, now rich and productive, had a very different appearance when the brethren first chose them as their place of retreat. Wide swamps, deep morasses, tangled thickets, and wild, impassable forests were their prevailing features.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} Clara Vallis of St Bernard, now the \"bright valley\" was originally, the \"Valley of Wormwood\".

It is named after its scholarly journal ''[[Annales d'histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale]]'', which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs.<ref>See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]</ref> The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of [[social science|social scientific]] methods by historians, emphasizing social rather than political or diplomatic themes, and for being generally hostile to the class analysis of [[Marxist historiography]].\n\nThe school deals primarily with [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe (before the [[French Revolution]]), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and influenced historiography in Europe and Latin America. Prominent leaders include co-founders [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878\u20131956), [[Henri Hauser]] (1866-1946) and [[Marc Bloch]] (1886\u20131944).  The second generation was led by [[Fernand Braudel]] (1902\u20131985) and included [[Georges Duby]] (1919\u20131996), [[Pierre Goubert]] (1915\u20132012), [[Robert Mandrou]] (1921\u20131984), [[Pierre Chaunu]] (1923\u20132009), [[Jacques Le Goff]] (1924\u20132014), and [[Ernest Labrousse]] (1895\u20131988). Institutionally it is based on the ''Annales'' journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the [[\u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes]], all based in Paris.  A third generation was led by [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] (1929\u2013 ) and includes Jacques Revel,<ref>Since 1978, Revel has taught at the [[\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales]] (Paris), where he is ''directeur d'\u00e9tudes'' (full professor); he served as president of the \u00c9cole from 1995 to 2004.</ref> and [[Philippe Ari\u00e8s]] (1914\u20131984), who joined the group in 1978.  The third generation stressed [[History of mentalities|history from the point of view of mentalities]], or ''mentalit\u00e9s''.  The fourth generation of Annales historians, led by [[Roger Chartier]] (1945\u2013 ), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the [[Cultural turn|cultural]] and [[linguistic turn]], which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.\n  \nThe main scholarly outlet has been the journal ''Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale'' (\"Annals of Economic and Social History\"), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. Its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices\nJanmesh Kokate was editor of ''Annales committee '' from 2003 to present, followed by the medievalist Jacques Le Goff. However,  informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie. Noting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] argues that \"in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the ''Annales'' came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric J. Hobsbawm|title=Interesting Times: A Twentieth-century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQqAAAAYAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Pantheon Books|page=295}}</ref>  Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.<ref>One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire & mesure'' (1986\u2013 ), devoted to quantitative history.</ref> However, the Annales ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political, and demographic research.<ref>Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the Twentieth Century: From Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge,\" 59\u201361.</ref>  An attempt to require an ''Annales''-written textbook for French schools was rejected by the government.<ref>Hunt (1986)</ref> By 1980 [[postmodern]] sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives. As [[Jacques Revel]] notes, the success of the Annales School, especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces, contained the seeds of its own downfall, for there is \"no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social, identified with the real.\"<ref>Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt, \"Microanalysis and the Construction of the Social,\" in ''Histories: French Constructions of the Past,'' ed. by Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt (1995) 480.</ref>  The Annales School kept its infrastructure, but lost its ''mentalit\u00e9s''.<ref>On the decline of Annales, see Hunt (1986); for a summary of the movement see Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'', 106\u2013107.</ref>\n\n==The journal==\n{{main article|Annales d'histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale}}\nThe journal began in Strasbourg as ''Annales d'histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale''; it moved to Paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939. It was successively renamed ''Annales d'histoire sociale'' (1939\u20131942, 1945), ''M\u00e9langes d'histoire sociale'' (1942\u20131944), ''Annales. Economies, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, civilisations'' (1946\u20131994), and ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'' (1994\u2013 ).<ref name=\"journal names\">P. Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution. The Annales School 1929\u201389'', p. 116 n. 2.</ref>\n\nIn 1962 Braudel and Gaston Berger used Ford Foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death. In 1970 the 6th Section and the ''Annales'' relocated to the FMSH building.  FMSH set up elaborate international networks to spread the ''Annales'' gospel across Europe and the world. In 2013 it began publication of an English language edition, with all the articles translated.\n\nThe scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental\u2014there is a search for total history and new approaches. The emphasis is on social history, and very long-term trends, often using quantification and paying special attention to geography<ref>See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'\u00e9volution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).</ref> and to the intellectual world view of common people, or \"mentality\" (''mentalit\u00e9''). Little attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men.  Instead the ''Annales'' focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.\n\n==Origins==\nThe ''Annales'' was founded and edited by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]] in 1929, while they were teaching at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and later in Paris. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the ''[[Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]'' (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]'') over events and political transformations.<ref>Colin Jones, \"Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue dur\u00e9e in French Revolutionary Historiography,\" ''Past & Present,'' 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178\u2013203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]</ref>  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalit\u00e9s,'' or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the Annales was to undo the work of the Sorbonnistes, to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.<ref>J.H. Hexter, \"Fernand Braudel and the Monde Braudellien,\" '' Historians,'' pp. 61</ref>\n\nCo-founder [[Marc Bloch]] (1886\u20131944) was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and in Germany, serving as a professor at the University of Strasbourg until he was called to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history.  Bloch's interests were  highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (1845\u20131918)<ref>Jason Hilkovitch & Max Fulkerson, \"Paul Vidal de la Blache: A biographical sketch\" at \n{{cite web\n |url=http://wwwstage.valpo.edu/geomet/histphil/test/vidal.html \n |title=Archived copy \n |accessdate=2006-09-23 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909192633/http://wwwstage.valpo.edu/geomet/histphil/test/vidal.html \n |archivedate=2006-09-09 \n |df= \n}}</ref>  and the sociology of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] (1858\u20131917).  His own ideas, especially those expressed in his masterworks, ''French Rural History'' (''Les caract\u00e8res originaux de l'histoire rurale fran\u00e7aise,'' 1931) and ''Feudal Society'', were incorporated by the second-generation Annalistes, led by [[Fernand Braudel]].\n\n==Precepts==\n[[Georges Duby]], a leader of the school, wrote that the history he taught:\n:relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society and civilisation.<ref>Georges Duby, ''Le dimanche de Bouvines'' (1973), forward</ref>\nThe Annalistes, especially [[Lucien Febvre]], advocated a ''histoire totale'', or ''histoire tout court'', a complete study of a historic problem.\n\n==Postwar==\nBloch was shot by the [[Gestapo]] during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]] in World War II for his active membership of the [[French Resistance]], and Febvre carried on the ''Annales'' approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he mentored Braudel, who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a \"second\" era of ''Annales'' historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of [[Philip II of Spain]]. \nBraudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.\n\nWhile authors such as [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Marc Ferro]] and [[Jacques Le Goff]] continue to carry the ''Annales'' banner, today the ''Annales'' approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in [[cultural history]], [[political history]] and [[economic history]].\n\n==''Mentalit\u00e9s''==\nBloch's ''Les Rois Thaumaturges'' (1924)<ref>Translated as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' (1990)</ref> looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure [[scrofula]] by his [[royal touch|thaumaturgic touch]].  The kings of France and England indeed regularly practiced the ritual.  Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch\u2014he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations (\"longue dur\u00e9e\") studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events.  Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities, or ''mentalit\u00e9s'', resonated with scholars who were reading [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]. In the 1960s, [[Robert Mandrou]] and [[Georges Duby]] harmonized the concept of ''mentalit\u00e9'' history with [[Fernand Braudel]]'s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of ''mentalit\u00e9'' studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, however, ''mentalit\u00e9'' history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis. While not explicitly rejecting ''mentalit\u00e9'' history, younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches.\n\n==Braudel==\nFernand Braudel became the leader of the second generation after 1945. He obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the 6th Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences.  It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1975 under the name [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS).  Braudel's followers admired his use of the longue dur\u00e9e approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue dur\u00e9e. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. In turn the Marxists called them conservatives.<ref>Olivia Harris, \"Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity.\" ''History Workshop Journal'' (2004) (57): 161\u2013174. {{ISSN|1363-3554}} Fulltext: [[OUP]]. Only Ari\u00e8s was a true conservative\u2014indeed a royalist.</ref>\n\nBraudel's first book, ''La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e et le Monde M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en \u00e0 l'Epoque de Philippe II'' (1949) (''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'') was his most influential.  This vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences, employed effectively the technique of the longue dur\u00e9e, and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals.  It stressed geography but not ''mentalit\u00e9''. It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.\n\n==Regionalism==\nBefore ''Annales,'' French history supposedly happened in Paris. Febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912, with his sweeping doctoral thesis on ''[[Philip II of Spain|Philippe II]] et la [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]].'' The geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the king's policies.\n\nThe ''Annales'' historians did not try to replicate Braudel's vast geographical scope in ''La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.'' Instead they focused on regions in France over long stretches of time. The most important was the study of the ''Peasants of Languedoc'' by Braudel's star pupil and successor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie.<ref>Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, ''The Peasants of Languedoc,'' (1966, translated 1977) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0252006356 excerpt and text search]</ref>  The regionalist tradition flourished especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the work of Pierre Goubert in 1960 on Beauvais and Ren\u00e9 Baehrel on Basse-Provence. ''Annales'' historians in the 1970s and 1980s turned to urban regions, including Pierre Deyon (Amiens), Maurice Garden (Lyon), Jean-Pierre Bardet (Rouen), Georges Freche (Toulouse), and Jean-Claude Perrot (Caen). By the 1970s the shift was underway from the earlier economic history to cultural history and the history of mentalities.<ref>Ernst Hinrichs, \"Provinzen, Landschaften, Regionen in Der Modernen Franz\u00f6sischen Geschichtswissenschaft \u2013 Ein Essay,\" ''Bl\u00e4tter F\u00fcr Deutsche Landesgeschichte'' 1994 130: 1\u201312. {{ISSN|0006-4408}} Fulltext: [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/bdlg/Blatt_bsb00000334,00007.html online edition]</ref>\n\n==Impact outside France==\nThe ''Annales'' school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries.  Its success varied widely.<ref>Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990) ch 5.</ref> The ''Annales'' approach was especially well received in [[Italy]] and [[Poland]]. [[Franciszek Bujak]] (1875\u20131953) and [[Jan Rutkowski]] (1886\u20131949), the founders of modern economic history in Poland and of the journal ''Roczniki Dziej\u00f3w Spolecznych i Gospodarczych'' (1931\u2013 ), were attracted to the innovations of the Annales school. Rutkowski was in contact with Bloch and others, and published in the ''Annales.'' After the Communists took control in the 1940s Polish scholars were safer working on the Middle Ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history. After the \"[[Polish October]]\" of 1956 the Sixth Section in Paris welcomed Polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the ''Annales'' and Polish scholars continued until the early 1980s. The reciprocal influence between the French school and Polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the Middle Ages and the early modern era studied by Braudel.<ref>Anita Krystyna Shelton, ''The Democratic Idea in Polish History and Historiography'' (1989). Even the Marxist journal ''Kwartalnik Historii Kultury Materialnej,'' founded in 1953, had an ''Annales'' flavor.</ref>\n\nIn South America the ''Annales'' approach became popular. From the 1950s [[Federico Brito Figueroa]] was the founder of a new Venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the Annales School. Brito Figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study, emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences.  Spanish historiography was influenced by the \"Annales School\" starting in 1950 with Jaime Vincens Vives (1910\u20131960).<ref>Nil Santi\u00e1\u00f1ez-Ti\u00f3, \"Temporalidad y discurso hist\u00f3rico: Propuesta de una renovaci\u00f3n metodol\u00f3gica de la historia de la literatura espa\u00f1ola moderna.\" [Temporality and Historical Discourse: Proposal of a Methodological Renewal of the History of Modern Spanish Literature].

Academic historians decidedly sided with [[Geoffrey Elton]]'s ''[[The Practice of History]]'' against [[Edward Hallett Carr]]'s ''[[What Is History?]]''. One of the few British historians who were sympathetic towards the work of the ''Annales'' school was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]. American, German, Indian, Russian and Japanese scholars generally ignored the school. The Americans developed their own form of \"new social history\" from entirely different roots.  Both the American and the ''Annales'' historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from French demographer [[Louis Henry]].<ref>Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990), pp 56, 96\u2013100.</ref>\n\nThe [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen]] school centered on [[Bernard Slicher van Bath]] was viewed internationally as a Dutch counterpart of the Annales school, although Slicher van Bath himself vehemently rejected the idea of a quantitative \"school\" of historiography.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |first=Jan |last=Kuys |title=Bernard Hendrik Slicher van Bath |encyclopedia=Biografisch Woordenboek Gelderland |publisher=Verloren |year=2006 |url=http://www.biografischwoordenboekgelderland.nl/bio/6_Bernard_Hendrik_Slicher_van_Bath}}</ref>\n\nHas been cited as a key influence in the development of [[World Systems Theory]] by sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].<ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel M. 2004.

He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading.  Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.\n\nChartier's typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of \"practices,\" his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of \"materials,\" his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of \"places,\" his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the ''Bible'', translations of Ovid, ''Hamlet'', ''Don Quixote'', Montaigne's essays, Pepys's diary, Richardson's ''Pamela'', and Franklin's autobiography.\n\n==See also==\n*[[\u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales]]\n*[[Historiography]]\n*[[Rural history]]\n*[[Nouvelle histoire]]\n*[[Social history]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===About the School===\n* Aurell i Cardona, Jaume. \"Autobiographical Texts as Historiographical Sources: Rereading Fernand Braudel and Annie Kriegel,\" ''Biography,'' Volume 29, Number 3, Summer 2006, pp.&nbsp;425\u2013445 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/biography/v029/29.3aurell.html in Project Muse]\n* Bintliff, John L.

For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.\n\n==Properties==\nThere are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric charge and spin), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>\n{{cite arxiv\n |last1=Dolgov |first1=A.

High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting [[Earth's atmosphere]] (or any other matter in the [[Solar System]]) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter. The [[frequency]] and [[wavelength]] of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511&nbsp;[[electronvolt|keV]] of energy (i.e., the [[rest mass]] of an [[electron]] multiplied by ''[[speed of light|c]]''<sup>2</sup>).\n\nObservations by the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[INTEGRAL|INTEGRAL satellite]] may explain the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the galactic center.

The reaction of {{val|1|ul=kg}} of antimatter with {{val|1|u=kg}} of matter would produce {{val|1.8|e=17|ul=J}} (180 petajoules) of energy (by the [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] formula, {{nowrap|1=''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}), or the rough equivalent of 43 megatons of TNT \u2013 slightly less than the yield of the 27,000&nbsp;kg [[Tsar Bomba]], the largest [[thermonuclear weapon]] ever detonated.\n\nNot all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products. While electron\u2013positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged [[pion]]s. The [[Pion#Neutral pion decays|neutral pions]] decay almost immediately (with a lifetime of 85 [[attoseconds]]) into high-energy photons, but the [[Pion#Charged pion decays|charged pions]] decay more slowly (with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds) and can be [[Antimatter rocket#Direct use of reaction products|deflected magnetically to produce thrust]].\n\nCharged pions ultimately decay into a combination of [[neutrino]]s (carrying about 22% of the energy of the charged pions) and unstable charged [[muon]]s (carrying about 78% of the charged pion energy), with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons, positrons and neutrinos (cf. [[muon decay]]; the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2/3 of the energy of the muons, meaning that from the original charged pions, the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about {{nowrap|1=0.22 + (2/3)\u22c50.78=0.74}}).<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Borowski |first=S.

They point out that, in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.\n\nAntimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.\n\nStorage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons . The drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons.\n\nOne researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:\n{{quote|If we could assemble all of the antimatter we've ever made at CERN and annihilate it with matter, we would have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |year=2004 [2008]\n |title=Angels and Demons: Do antimatter atoms exist?\n |url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |publisher=[[CERN]]\n |accessdate=2010-11-18\n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKlfM7bo?url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |archivedate=2010-11-18\n}}</ref>}}\n--->\n\n===Weapons===\n{{Main article|Antimatter weapon}}\n\nAntimatter has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |title=Antimatter weapons\n |publisher=\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424174413/http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |archivedate=24 April 2013\n |df=dmy-all\n |deadurl=no\n}}</ref> A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities, and there is no evidence that it will ever be feasible.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last1=Gsponer |first1=Andre\n |last2=Hurni |first2=Jean-Pierre\n |year=1987\n |chapter=The physics of antimatter induced fusion and thermonuclear explosions\n |editor1-last=Velarde |editor1-first=G.\n |editor2-last=Minguez |editor2-first=E.\n |title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems, Madrid, June/July, 1986\n |volume=4 |issue=30 |pages=66\u2013169\n |publisher=[[World Scientific]]\n |arxiv=physics/0507114\n |bibcode=2005physics...7114G\n}}</ref> However, the U.S. Air Force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the [[Cold War]], and began considering its possible use in weapons, not just as a trigger, but as the explosive itself.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/10/04/MNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |title=Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons / Program was touted publicly, then came official gag order\n |publisher=\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609101650/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F10%2F04%2FMNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |archivedate=9 June 2012\n |df=dmy-all\n |deadurl=no\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Antimatter comet}}\n* {{annotated link|Ambiplasma}}\n* {{annotated link|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=G.

The ground floor, in particular, has unusual [[tracery]], irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work. There are few straight lines, and much of the [[fa\u00e7ade]] is decorated with a colorful [[mosaic]] made of broken ceramic tiles ([[trencad\u00eds]]). The roof is [[arch]]ed and was likened to the back of a [[European dragon|dragon]] or [[dinosaur]]. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of [[Saint George]] (patron saint of [[Catalonia]], Gaud\u00ed's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.\n\n==History==\n\n===Initial construction (1877)===\n[[File:Gaud%C3%AD_(1910).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Antoni Gaud\u00ed in 1910]]\nThe building that is now Casa Batll\u00f3  was built in 1877, commissioned by Llu\u00eds Sala S\u00e1nchez.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bassegoda i Nonell |first= Joan |title= La Casa Batll\u00f3 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/La_Casa_Batll%C3%B3.html?id=kJ5oMwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y |accessdate= March 8, 2012|year=2001 |publisher= Publicaciones de la Real C\u00e1tedra Gaud\u00ed |location=Barcelona |page=4 |language=Spanish}}</ref> It was a classical building without remarkable characteristics within the [[eclecticism]] traditional by the end of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bassegoda i Nonell |first= Joan |title= Los jardines de Gaud\u00ed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPM01pCm_QIC&dq=isbn:8483015382 |year=2001 |publisher=Edicions UPC |isbn=9788483015384 |page=75 |language=Spanish}}</ref> The building had a basement, a ground floor, four other floors and a garden in the back.<ref name=\"workart\">[http://www.casabatllo.es/en/history/casa-batllo/gaudi-work-art/]</ref>\n\n===Batll\u00f3 family===\n[[File:Batllo-godo-per Napoleon.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The Batll\u00f3 family]]\nThe house was bought by Josep Batll\u00f3 in 1900. The design of the house made the home undesirable to buyers but the Batll\u00f3 family decided to buy the place due to its centralized location. It is located in the middle of [[Passeig de Gracia]], which in the early 20th century was known as a very prestigious and fashionable area. It was an area where the prestigious family could draw attention to themselves.<ref name=\"workart\"/>\n\nIn 1906 Josep Batll\u00f3 still owned the home. The Batll\u00f3 family was very well known in Barcelona for its contribution to the textile industry in the city. Mr. Josep Batll\u00f3 I Casanovas was a textile industrialist who owned a few factories in the city. Mr. Batll\u00f3 married Amalia Godo Belaunzaran, from the family that founded the newspaper La Vanguardia. Josep wanted an architect that would design a house that was like no other and stood out as being audacious and creative. Both Josep and his wife were open to anything and they decided not to limit Gaud\u00ed. Josep did not want his house to resemble any of the houses of the rest of the Batll\u00f3 family, such as Casa P\u00eda, built by the Josep Vilaseca. He chose the architect who had designed [[Park G\u00fcell]] because he wanted him to come up with a risky plan. The family lived on the Noble Floor of Casa Batll\u00f3 until the middle of the 1950s.<ref>[http://www.casabatllo.es/en/history/batllo-family/]</ref>\n\n===Renovation (1904-1906)===\n[[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 (Antoni Gaudi) (atrium,close up), 43, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.jpg|thumb|240px|The atrium; Gaud\u00ed convinced Batll\u00f3 to let him expand the central well of the building to let in light, instead of rebuilding.]]\nIn 1904 Josep Batll\u00f3 hired Gaud\u00ed to design his home; at first his plans were to tear down the building and construct a completely new house. Gaud\u00ed convinced Josep that a renovation was sufficient and was also able to submit the planning application the same year. The building was completed and refurbished in 1906. He completely changed the main apartment which became the residence for the Batll\u00f3 family. He expanded the central well in order to supply light to the whole building and also added new floors. In the same year the Barcelona City Council selected the house as a candidate for that year's best building award. The award was given to another architect that year despite Gaud\u00ed's design.\n\n===Refurbishments===\nJosep Batll\u00f3 died in 1934 and the house was kept in order by the wife until her death in 1940 . After the death of the two parents, the house was kept and managed by the children until 1954. In 1954 an insurance company named Seguros Iberia acquired Casa Batll\u00f3 and set up offices there. In 1970, the first refurbishment occurred mainly in several of the interior rooms of the house. In 1983, the exterior balconies were restored to their original colour and a year later the exterior fa\u00e7ade was illuminated in the ceremony of [[La Merc\u00e8]].\n\n===Multiple uses===\nIn 1993, the current owners of Casa Batll\u00f3 bought the home and continued refurbishments throughout the whole building.<ref>In 1999 the elevator was reformed to adapt it to modern standards preserving its original appearance. The project was by Joan Bassegoda Nonell and collaborators Bibiana Sciortino and Mario Andruet.</ref> Two years later, in 1995, Casa Batll\u00f3 began to hire out its facilities for different events. More than 2,500 square meters of rooms within the building were rented out for many different functions. Due to the building's location and the beauty of the facilities being rented, the rooms of Casa Batll\u00f3 were in very high demand and hosted many important events for the city.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 fireplace seat.JPG|thumb|Casa Batll\u00f3 fireplace seat]]\n\n===Overview===\nThe local name for the building is ''Casa dels ossos'' (House of Bones), as it has a [[viscera]]l, [[skeleton|skeletal]] organic quality. The building looks very remarkable &mdash; like everything Gaud\u00ed designed, only identifiable as [[Modernisme]] or [[Art Nouveau]] in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, is rather astonishing with tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work.\n\nIt seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely. Much of the [[fa\u00e7ade]] is decorated with a [[mosaic]] made of broken ceramic tiles ([[trencad\u00eds]]) that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues. The roof is [[arch]]ed and was likened to the back of a [[European dragon|dragon]] or [[dinosaur]]. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of [[Saint George]] (patron saint of [[Catalonia]], Gaud\u00ed's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.\n\n===Loft===\n[[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 Parabolic Arches.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The loft, originally a service area, has sixty [[catenary arches]]]]\n\nThe loft is considered to be one of the most unusual spaces. It was formerly a service area for the tenants of the different apartments in the building which contained laundry rooms and storage areas. It is known for its simplicity of shapes and its Mediterranean influence through the use of white on the walls. It contains a series of sixty [[catenary arch]]es that creates a space which represents the ribcage of an animal.  Some people believe that the \u201cribcage\u201d design of the arches is a ribcage for the dragon's spine that is represented in the roof.\n\n===Noble floor and museum===\n[[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 (Antoni Gaudi) (interior), 43, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Interior of the Noble Floor, which currently houses a museum open to the public]]\nThe noble floor is larger than seven-hundred square meters. It is the main floor of the building. The noble floor is accessed through a private entrance hall that utilizes skylights resembling tortoise shells and vaulted walls in curving shapes.  On the noble floor, there is a spacious landing with direct views to the blue tiling of the building well. On the Passeig de Gracia side is Mr. Batll\u00f3's study, a dining room, and a secluded spot for courting couples, decorated with a mushroom-shaped fireplace. The elaborate and animal-like d\u00e9cor continues throughout the whole noble floor.\n\nIn 2002, the house opened its doors to the public, and people were allowed to visit the noble floor. The building was opened to the public as part of the celebration of the International Year of Gaud\u00ed. Casa Batll\u00f3 met with very much unanticipated success, and visitors became eager to see the rest of the house. Two years later, in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the beginning of work on Casa Batll\u00f3 the fifth floor was restored, and the house extended its visit to the loft and the well. In 2005, Casa Batll\u00f3 became a [[Unesco World Heritage Site]].<ref>[http://www.worldsiteguides.com/europe/spain/barcelona/casa-batllo/]</ref>\n\n===Roof===\n[[File:Jfader batto roof.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Four chimney stacks on the roof, with the dragon's spine roof arch behind]]\nThe roof terrace is one of the most popular features of the entire house due to its famous dragon back design. Gaud\u00ed represents an animal's spine by using tiles of different colors on one side. The roof is decorated with four chimney stacks, that are designed to prevent backdraughts.<ref>[http://www.casabatllo.es/en/history/the-building/]</ref>\n\n===Exterior facade===\n[[File:CasaBatllo 0170.JPG|thumb|left|150px|The facade has three distinct sections.]]\nThe facade has three distinct sections which are harmoniously integrated. The lower ground floor with the main floor and two first-floor galleries are contained in a structure of [[Montju\u00efc]]  sandstone with undulating lines. The central part, which reaches the last floor, is a multicolored section with protruding balconies.  The top of the building is a crown, like a huge gable, which is at the same level as the roof and helps to conceal the room where there used to be water tanks. This room is currently empty. The top displays a [[Molding (decorative)|trim]] with ceramic pieces that has attracted multiple interpretations.\n\n;Roof tiles\n[[File:casa batllo roof.jpg|thumb|150px|Roof architecture and ceramic tiles, with tower and bulb in the background]]\nThe roof's arched profile recalls the spine of a dragon with ceramic tiles for scales, and a small triangular window towards the right of the structure simulates the eye. Legend has it that it was once possible to see the Sagrada Familia through this window,  which was being built simultaneously. The view of the [[Sagrada Familia]] is now blocked from this vantage point by newer buildings.<ref>[[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFCirici1956|Circi 1956, pp. 161\u2013165]]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> The tiles were given a metallic sheen to simulate the varying scales of the monster, with the color grading from green on the right side, where the head begins, to deep blue and violet in the center, to red and pink on the left side of the building.\n\n;Tower and bulb\nOne of the highlights of the facade is a tower topped with a cross of four arms oriented to the cardinal directions. It is a bulbous, root-like structure that evokes plant life. There is a second bulb-shaped structure similarly reminiscent of a thalamus flower, which is represented by a cross with arms that are actually buds announcing the next flowering. The tower is decorated with monograms of Jesus (JHS), Maria (M with the ducal crown) and Joseph (JHP), made of ceramic pieces that stand out golden on the green background that covers the facade. These symbols show the deep religiosity of Gaudi, who was inspired by the contemporaneous construction of his basilica <ref>[[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFBassegoda1981|Bassegoda 1981]]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> to choose the theme of the holy family.\n\nThe bulb was broken when it was delivered, perhaps during transportation. Although the manufacturer committed to re-do the broken parts, Gaud\u00ed liked the aesthetic of the broken masonry and asked that the pieces be stuck to the main structure with lime mortar and held in with a brass ring.<ref>[[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFBassegoda i Nonell2001|Bassegoda Nonell and 2001, p. 10.]]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref>\n\n;Central section\n[[File:Casa Batllo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The central part of the facade evokes the surface of a lake with water lilies.]]\nThe central part of the facade evokes the surface of a lake with water lilies, reminiscent of [[Monet]]'s Nymph\u00e9as, with gentle ripples and reflections caused by the glass and ceramic mosaic.<ref>[[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFBassegoda2001|Bassegoda 2001, p. 75.]]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> It is a great undulating surface covered with plaster fragments of colored glass discs combined with 330 rounds of polychrome pottery.

Two iron arms were installed here to support a pulley to raise and lower furniture.<ref>[[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFLahuerta2001|Lahuerta 2001, p. 31.]]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref>\n\n;Main floor\nThe facade of the main floor, made entirely in sandstone, and is supported by two columns.

Carmel Hill belongs to the mountain range of [[Collserola]] \u2013 the [[Parc del Carmel]] is located on the northern face. Park G\u00fcell is located in [[La Salut]], a neighborhood in the [[Gr\u00e0cia district]] of Barcelona. With urbanization in mind, [[Eusebi G\u00fcell]] assigned the design of the park to [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]], a renowned architect and the face of [[Catalan modernism]]. \n\nThe park was built from 1900 to 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. In 1984, [[UNESCO]] declared the park a [[World Heritage Site]] under \"[[Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]\".<ref name=gaudiunesco>{{Citation | title =Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed |publisher = Unesco| url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320 | accessdate = 15 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2016}}\nPark G\u00fcell is the reflection of Gaud\u00ed's artistic plenitude, which belongs to his [[naturalist]] phase (first decade of the 20th century). During this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. He put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. To that, the Catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. Starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises. In the design of Park G\u00fcell, Gaud\u00ed unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the [[Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family]] (Catalan: [[Sagrada Familia]]).\n\nG\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed conceived this park, situated within a natural park. They imagined an organized grouping of high-quality homes, decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort, finished off with an artistic touch. They also envisioned a community strongly influenced by [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], since, in the common elements of the park, they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect: therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political [[Catalanism]] \u2013  especially in the entrance stairway where the [[Catalan countries]] are represented \u2013 and from [[Catholicism]] \u2013 the [[Monumento al Calvario]], originally designed to be a [[chapel]]. The [[mythological]] elements are so important: apparently G\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed's conception of the park was also inspired by the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] of [[Delphi]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn the other hand, many experts{{Who|date=April 2016}} have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex [[iconography]] that Gaud\u00ed applied to the urban project. Such references go from political vindication to [[religious]] exaltation, passing through [[mythology]], [[history]] and [[philosophy]]. Specifically, many studies claim to see references to [[Freemasonry]], despite the deep religious beliefs of both Gaud\u00ed and [[Count G\u00fcell]]. These references have not been proven in the [[historiography]] of the modern architect. The multiplicity of symbols found in the Park G\u00fcell is, as previously mentioned, associated to political and religious signs, with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and [[puzzles]].\n\n==Origins as a housing development==\nThe park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site, the idea of Count [[Eusebi G\u00fcell]], after whom the park was named. It was inspired by the English [[garden city movement]]; hence the original English name ''Park'' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] the name is \"Parc G\u00fcell\"). The site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called ''Muntanya Pelada'' (Bare Mountain). It already included a large country house called Larrard House or Muntaner de Dalt House and was next to a neighbourhood of upper-class houses called ''La Salut'' (The Health). The intention was to exploit the fresh air (well away from smoky factories) and beautiful views from the site, with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses. Count Eusebi G\u00fcell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in Larrard House. Ultimately, only two houses were built, neither designed by Gaud\u00ed. One was intended to be a show house, but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale, and as no buyers came forward, Gaud\u00ed, at G\u00fcell's suggestion, bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906.<ref name=zim>{{Citation | last = Zimmermann | first = Robert | year =2002 | title =The Best of Gaud\u00ed | place = | publisher = | url =http://www.sola-sole.com/bgaudi.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702205603/http://www.sola-sole.com/bgaudi.pdf|archive-date=22 July 2007}}</ref> This house, where Gaud\u00ed lived from 1906 to 1926, was built by Francesc Berenguer in 1904. It contains original works by Gaud\u00ed and several of his collaborators. It is now the [[Gaudi House Museum]] (Casa Museu Gaud\u00ed) since 1963. In 1969 it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest.\n\n== Municipal garden ==\n[[File:Barcelona 193.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Gaudi House Museum]]]]\n[[File:Parc G\u00fcell Dragon Restored.jpg|left|thumb|Gaud\u00ed's multicolored [[mosaic]] salamander, popularly known as \"el drac\" (the dragon), at the main entrance, as restored after the vandalism of February 2007]]\n[[File:Park Guell Terrace.JPG|left|thumb|Gaud\u00ed's mosaic work on the main terrace]]\n\nIt has since been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground railway (although the stations are at a distance from the Park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. Since October 2013 there is an entrance fee to visit the Monumental Zone (main entrance, terrace, and the parts containing mosaics), but the entrance to the Park remains free. Gaud\u00ed's house, \"la Torre Rosa,\" \u2013 containing furniture that he designed \u2013 can be only visited for another entrance fee. There is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Gaud\u00ed's house and the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]] Church.\n\nPark G\u00fcell is designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park. The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaud\u00ed. One of these buildings houses a permanent exhibition of the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] MUHBA focused on the building itself, the park and the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=MUHBA Park G\u00fcell|url=http://museuhistoria.bcn.cat/en/node/654}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXEGigoEa5k|title=LMVC UPC CPSV.

The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaud\u00ed incorporated many motifs of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park. Much of the design of the benches was the work not of Gaud\u00ed but of his often overlooked collaborator [[Josep Maria Jujol]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/09/gaudis-partner-in-iconic-barcelona-design-finally-gets-the-limelight |title=Gaud\u00ed's partner in iconic Barcelona design finally gets the limelight |publisher=The Guardian |first=Stephen |last=Burgen |date=2016-09-09 |accessdate=2016-09-09}}</ref>\n\nRoadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaud\u00ed as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaud\u00ed designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his [[Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]] so that the [[Inverted catenary|inverted catenary arch]] shapes form perfect compression structures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dataphys.org/list/gaudis-hanging-chain-models/ |title=1889 \u2013 Gaud\u00ed's Hanging Chain Models |website=List of Physical Visualizations |access-date=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe large cross at the park's high-point offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay. It is possible to view the main city in panorama, with the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and the [[Montju\u00efc]] area visible at a distance.\n\nThe park supports a wide variety of wildlife, notably several of the non-native species of [[parrot]] found in the Barcelona area. Other birds can be seen from the park, with records including [[Short-toed snake eagle|short-toed eagle]]. The park also supports a population of [[Macroglossum stellatarum|hummingbird hawk moths]].\n\n==Gallery of images==\n<gallery>\nFile:View from Park G\u00fcell Terrace.jpg| View from the main terrace of the park.\nFile:Goelenterance06390139.JPG|Entrance to the Park.\nFile:Goeldoric06390141.JPG|Doric columns support the roof of the lower court which forms the central terrace, with serpentine seating round its edge.\nFile:Goelbench06390140.JPG|The unique shape of the serpentine bench enables the people sitting on it to converse privately, although the square is large.

It was the last private residence designed by architect [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]] and was built between 1906 and 1912.\n\nThe building was commissioned in 1906 by {{illm|Pere Mil\u00e0|ca|Pere Mil\u00e0 i Camps|es|Pere Mil\u00e0 i Camps}} and his wife {{illm|Roser Segimon|ca|Roser Segimon i Artells|es|Roser Segimon i Artells}}.

In September, they commissioned Gaud\u00ed for building them a new house with the idea of living in the main floor and renting out the rest of the apartments. On February 2, 1906, the project was presented to the Barcelona City Council and the works began, demolishing the pre-existing building instead of reforming it, as in the case of the [[Casa Batll\u00f3]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://pedreraeducacio.lapedrera.com/eng/index.htm|title=Cronology of La Pedrera (A place of memory)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe building was completed in December 1910 and the owner asked Gaud\u00ed to make a certificate to inhabit the main floor, which the City Council authorized in October 1911, and the couple moved in. On October 31, 1912, Gaud\u00ed issued the certificate stating that, in accordance with his plans and his direction, the work had been completed and the whole house was ready to be rented.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Critics and controversies ===\nThe building did not respect any rules of conventional style, for which Gaud\u00ed received much criticism.

In 1953, they commissioned {{Interlanguage link multi|Francisco Juan Barba Corsini|es}} to convert 13 rubbish-filled attic laundry rooms to street-facing apartments, leaving a communal hallway on the side facing the courtyards. Some of these two or three room apartments had a [[loft]] and were designed and furnished in a typical early 1950s style using brick, ceramic and wood. Items of furniture, such as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pedrera chair|ca|3=Cadira Pedrera}}, were reminiscent of [[Eero Saarinen]]'s work.<ref name=corsini>[http://www.raco.cat/index.php/CuadernosArquitectura/article/view/108448/170570 Barba Corsini, F.J.

By then, Casa Mil\u00e0 had housed a [[bingo hall]], an academy and the offices of Cementos Molins and Inoxcrom among others.<ref Name=huertas/> Maintenance costs were high and the owners had allowed the building to become dilapidated, causing stones to loosen in 1971.

Casa Mil\u00e0 was in poor condition in the early 1980s. It had been painted a dreary brown and many of its interior color schemes had been abandoned or allowed to deteriorate, but it has been restored since and many of the original colors revived.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nIn 1984 the building became part of a [[World Heritage Site]] encompassing some of Gaud\u00ed's works. The Barcelonan city council tried to rent the main floor as an office for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic]] bid. Finally, the day before [[Christmas]] 1986, [[Caixa Catalunya]] bought La Pedrera for 900 million pesetas.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} On February 19, 1987, urgently needed work began on the restoration and cleaning of the fa\u00e7ade. The work was done by the architects Joseph Emilio Hern\u00e1ndez-Cross and Rafael Vila.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The renovated main floor opened in 1990 as part of the [[Cultural Olympiad]] of Barcelona. The floor became an exhibition room with an example of [[modernism]] in the [[Eixample]].<ref name=huertas/>\n\n== Design ==\nThe building is 1,323 m<sup>2</sup> per floor on a plot of 1,620 m<sup>2</sup>. Gaud\u00ed made the first sketches in his workshop in the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]]. He designed the house as a constant curve, both outside and inside, incorporating [[ruled surface|ruled geometry]] and naturalistic elements.\n\n[[File:Casa Mila-panoramic.jpg|thumb|right|The courtyard]]\nCasa Mil\u00e0 consists of two buildings, which are structured around two courtyards that provide light to the nine storeys: basement, ground floor, mezzanine, main (or noble) floor, four upper floors, and an attic. The basement was intended to be the garage, the main floor the residence of the Mil\u00e0s (a flat of all 1,323 m<sup>2</sup>), and the rest distributed over 20 apartments. The resulting layout is shaped like an asymmetrical \"8\" because of the different shapes and sizes of the courtyards. The attic housed the laundry and drying areas, forming an insulating space for the building and simultaneously determining the levels of the roof.\n\nOne of the most notable elements of the building is the roof, crowned with skylights, staircase exits, fans, and chimneys. All of these elements, constructed out of brick covered with lime, [[trencad\u00eds|broken marble, or glass]] have a specific architectural function but are also real sculptures integrated into the building.\n\nThe apartments feature plastered ceilings with dynamic reliefs, handcrafted wooden doors, windows, and furniture, as well as [[hydraulic tile]]s and various ornamental elements.\n\nThe stairways were intended as service entries, with the main access to the apartments by elevator except for the noble floor, where Gaud\u00ed added a prominent interior staircase. Gaud\u00ed wanted the people who lived in the flats to all know each other. Therefore, there were only elevators on every other floor, so people on different floors would meet one another.\n\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:CasaMila-Balcons.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|CasaMila-Balcony, showing the self-supporting stone facade, also supported by curved iron beams]]\nCasa Mil\u00e0 is characterized by its self-supporting stone facade, meaning that it is free of load-bearing walls. The facade connects to the internal structure of each floor by means of curved iron beams surrounding the perimeter of each floor. This construction system allows, on one hand, large openings in the facade which give light to the homes, and on the other, free structuring of the different levels, so that internal walls can be added and demolished without affecting the stability of the building. This allows the owners to change their minds at will and to modify, without problems, the interior layout of the homes.<ref name=any2002a>[http://www.bcn.es/gaudi2002/catalan/obras/10com.htm Descripci\u00f3 casa Mil\u00e0] a \u00abany Gaud\u00ed\u00bb a l'Ajuntament de Barcelona</ref>\n\n=== Constructive and decorative items ===\n==== Facade ====\nThe facade is composed of large blocks of [[limestone]] from the [[Garraf Massif]] on the first floor and from the [[Villefranche-de-Conflent|Villefranche]] quarry for the higher levels. The blocks were cut to follow the plot of the projection of the model, then raised to their location and adjusted to align in a continuous curve to the pieces around them.\n\nViewed from the outside the building has three parts: the main body of the six-storey blocks with winding stone floors, two floors set a block back with a different curve, similar to waves,  a smoother texture and whiter color, and with small holes that look like [[embrasure]]s, and finally the body of the roof.<ref name=permanyer>[[#permanyer|Permanyer, 1996....p\u00e0g. 150-166]]</ref>\n\nGaud\u00ed's original facade had some of its lower-level ironwork removed. In 1928, the tailor Mosella opened the first store in La Pedrera, and he eliminated the bars. This did not concern anyone, because in the middle of twentieth century, wrought ironwork had little importance. The ironwork was lost until a few years later, when Americans donated one of them to the [[Museum of Modern Art in New York|MoMa]], where it is on display.\n\nWith restoration initiatives launched in 1987, the facade was rejoined to some pieces of stone that had fallen. In order to respect the fidelity of the original, material was obtained from the Villefranche quarry, even though by then it was no longer operating.<ref Name=huertas/>\n\n==== Hall and courtyards ====\nThe building uses a completely original solution to solve the issue of a lobby being too closed and dark. Its open and airy courtyards provide a place of transit and are directly visible to those accessing the building. There are two patios on the side of the Passeig de Gracia and of the street Provence.\n\n;Patios\n[[File:Staircase - Patio of Casa Mil\u00e0 - Barcelona 2014.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The patio]]\nPatios, structurally, are key as supporting loads of interior facades. The floor of the courtyard is supported by pillars of [[cast iron]]. In the courtyard, there are traditional elliptical beams and girders but Gaud\u00ed applied an ingenious solution of using two concentric cylindrical beams with stretched radial beams, like the spokes of a bicycle. They form a point outside of the beam to two points above and below, making the function of the central girder a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] and working in tension and compression simultaneously. This supported structure is twelve feet in diameter and is considered \"the soul of the building\" with a clear resemblance to Gothic crypts. The centerpiece was built in a shipyard by [[Josep Maria Carandell]] who copied a steering wheel, interpreting Gaud\u00ed's intent as to represent the helm of the ship of life.\n\n;Interior, gates\n[[File:Front gate - Casa Mil\u00e0 - Barcelona 2014.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Paintings cover the walls, with access protected by a giant iron gate]]\nAccess is protected by a massive [[iron]] gate with a design attributed to Jujol. It was originally used by both people and cars, as access to the garage is in the basement, now an [[auditorium]].\n\nThe two halls are fully polychrome with oil [[Mural paintings in the lobby of the Casa Mila|paintings]] on the plaster surfaces, with [[eclecticism|eclectic]] references to [[mythology]] and flowers.\n\nDuring construction there was a problem including a basement as a garage for cars, the new invention that was thrilling the bourgeois at the time. The future neighbor Felix Anthony Meadows, owner of Industrial Linera, requested a change because his [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls Royce]] could not access it. Gaud\u00ed agreed to remove a pillar on the ramp that led into the garage so that Felix, who was establishing sales and factory in [[Walls of Valles]], could go to both places with his car from La Pedrera.<ref Name=huertas/>\n\nFor the floors of Casa Mil\u00e0, Gaud\u00ed used a model of [[floor]] forms of square timbers with two colors, and the [[hydraulic pavement]] hexagonal pieces of blue and sea motifs that had originally been designed for the Batllo house. The wax was designed in gray by John Bertrand under the supervision of Gaud\u00ed who \"touched up with their own fingers,\" in the words of the manufacturer [[Josep Bay]].<ref name=bayo20>[[#bayo|Bassegoda, 2003....p\u00e0g. 20]]</ref>\n\n==== Loft ====\n[[File:Attic of Casa Mil\u00e0.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The attic]]\nLike in [[Casa Batll\u00f3]], Gaud\u00ed shows the application of the [[catenary arch]] as a support structure for the roof, a form which he had already used shortly after graduating in the wood frameworks of [[Matar\u00f3]]'s cooperative known as \"L'Obrera Mataronense.\" In this case, Gaud\u00ed used the Catalan technique of [[Catalan vault|timbrel]], imported from [[Italy]] in the fourteenth century.\n\nThe attic, where the laundry rooms were located, was a clear room under a [[Catalan vault]] roof supported by 270 [[parabolic vault]]s of different heights and spaced by about 80&nbsp;cm. The roof resembles both the ribs of a huge animal and a palm, giving the roof-deck a very unconventional shape similar to a landscape of hills and valleys. The shape and location of the courtyards makes the arches higher when the space is narrowed and lower when the space expands.\n\nThe builder Bay\u00f3 explained its construction: \"First the face of a wide wall was filled with mortar and plastered. Then [[Josep Canaleta i Cuadras|Canaleta]] indicated the opening of each arch and Bay\u00f3 put a nail at each starting point of the arch at the top of the wall. From these nails was dangled a chain so that the lowest point coincided with the deflection of the arch. Then the profile displayed on the wall by the chain was drawn and on this profile the carpenter marked and placed the corresponding centering, and the timbrel vault was started with three rows of plane bricks.

The staircases also house the water tanks; some of which are snail-shaped.\n\nThe stepped roof of La Pedrera, called \"the garden of warriors\" by the poet [[Pere Gimferrer]] because the chimneys appear to be protecting the skylights, has undergone a radical restoration, removing chimneys added in interventions after Gaud\u00ed, television antennas, and other elements that degraded the space. The restoration brought back the splendor to the chimneys and the skylights that were covered with fragments of [[marble]] and broken [[tile Valencia|Valencia tiles]]. One of the chimneys was topped with glass pieces&nbsp;\u2013 it was said that Gaud\u00ed did that the day after the inauguration of the building, taking advantage of the empty bottles from the party. It was restored with the bases of champagne bottles from the early twentieth century. The repair work has enabled the restoration of the original impact of the overhangs made of stone from [[Ulldecona]] with fragments of tiles. This whole set is more colorful than the facade, although here the creamy tones are dominant.<ref name=ruta>[http://www.rutadelmodernisme.com/default.aspx?idioma=ca&contenido=body_rutamodernisme_04.htm Ruta del Modernisme].

This was part of the concept artwork itself integral to [[modernism]] in which the architect assumed responsibility for global issues such as the structure and the facade, as well as every detail of the decor, designing furniture and accessories such as lamps, planters, floors or ceilings.\n\nThis was another point of friction with Segimon, who complained that there was no straight wall to place her Steinway piano.<ref name = orchards>{{cite book | title=La Pedrera: arquitectura i hist\u00f2ria | publisher=Caixa de Catalunya | author=Flores, Carlos | year=1999 | pages=187\u2013224 | isbn=978-84-87135-35-4}}</ref> Gaud\u00ed's response was blunt: \"So play the violin.\" <ref name=patrimoni/> The result of these disagreements has been the loss of the decorative legacy of Gaud\u00ed, as most of the furniture was removed due to climate change and the changes she made to the main floor when Gaud\u00ed died. Some remain in private collections, including a curtain made of [[oak]] 4 m. long by 1.96 m. high in the Museum of Catalan Modernism; and a chair and desktop of Mil\u00e0.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nGaud\u00ed carved oak doors similar to what he had done for the Casa y Bardes, but these were only included on two floors as when Segimon discovered the price, she decided there would be no more at that quality.<ref name=bayo20/>\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Catalunya en Miniatura-La Pedrera.JPG|thumb|Scale model at the [[Catalunya en Miniatura]] park]]\n''Casa Mil\u00e0'' is part of the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] \"Works of [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]\". It was a predecessor of some buildings with a similar [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] appearance:\n* the 1921 [[Einstein Tower]] in [[Potsdam]], designed by [[Erich Mendelsohn]]\n* [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]\n* [[Chapelle Notre Dame du Haut]], [[Ronchamp]], [[France]], designed by [[Le Corbusier]]\n* the [[Hundertwasserhaus]] and other works by Austrian architect [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]]\n* [[Disney Concert Hall]] in [[Los Angeles]], by [[Frank Gehry]]\n\nFree exhibitions often are held on the first floor, which also provides some opportunity to see the interior design. There is a charge for entrance to the apartment on the fourth floor and the roof. The other floors are not open to visitors.\n\n=== Constructive similarities ===\nGaud\u00ed's La Pedrera was inspired by a mountain, but there is no agreement as to which mountain was the reference model. Joan Berg\u00f3s thought it was the rocks of Fray Guerau in [[Prades mountains]]. Joan Matamala thought that the model could have been St. Miquel del Fai, while the sculptor Vicente Vilarubias believed it was inspired by the cliffs Torrent Pareis in [[Menorca]]. Other options include the mountains of [[U\u00e7hisar]] in [[Cappadocia]], suggested by Juan Goytisolo, or Mola Gallifa, suggested by Louis Permanyer, based on the fact that Gaud\u00ed visited the area in 1885 to escape an outbreak of cholera in [[Barcelona]].<ref name=permanyer/>\n\nSome people say that the interior layout of La Pedrera comes from studies that Gaud\u00ed made of medieval fortresses. This image is reinforced by the seeming appearance of the rooftop chimneys as \"sentinels\" with great helmets.<ref Name=ruta/> The structure of the iron door in the lobby does not follow any symmetry, straight or repetitive pattern. Rather, it evokes bubbles of [[soap]] that are formed between the hands or the structures of a plant cell.<ref name=cirici>[[Alexandre Cirici i Pellicer|CIRICI A.]] ''Barcelona pam a pam''.

It was given the nickname \"La Pedrera\", meaning \"the quarry\".<ref Name=huertas/> Casa Mil\u00e0 appeared in many satirical magazines. [[Joan Junceda]] presented it as a traditional \"Easter cake\" by means of cartoons in ''[[Patufet]]''. Joaquim Garcia made a joke about the difficulty of setting the damask wrought iron balconies in his magazine.<ref Name=huertas/> Homeowners in [[Passeig de Gracia]] became angry with Mil\u00e0 and ceased to greet him, arguing that the weird building by Gaud\u00ed would lower the price of land in the area.\n\n===Administrative problems===\nCasa Mil\u00e0 also caused some administrative problems. In December 1907 the [[City Council|City Hall]] stopped work on the building because of a pillar which occupied part of the sidewalk, not respecting the alignment of facades. Again on August 17, 1908, more problems occurred when the building surpassed the predicted height and borders of its construction site by {{convert|4000|m2|ft2}}. The Council called for a fine of 100,000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] (approximately 25% of the cost of work) or for the demolition of the attic and roof. The dispute was resolved a year and a half later, December 28, 1909, when the Commission certified that it was a monumental building and thus not required to have a 'strict compliance' with the bylaws.<ref name=cronologia/>\n\n{{Anchor|Contests}}\n\n===Design competitions===\nThe owner entered La Pedrera in the annual {{illm|Barcelona Artistic Buildings Competition|ca|Concurs anual d'edificis art\u00edstics|es|Concurso anual de edificios art\u00edsticos (Barcelona)}} sponsored by the Barcelona City Council (''[[Ayuntamiento (Spain)|Ayuntament]]'').

There were many disagreements between them, one example was the monumental bronze virgin del Rosario, which Gaud\u00ed wanted as the statue on the front of the building in homage to the name of the owner, that the artist Carles Mani i Roig was to sculpt. The statue was not made although the words \"''Ave gratia M plena Dominus tecum''\" were written at the top of the facade. Continuing disagreements led Gaud\u00ed to take Mil\u00e0 to court over his fees. The lawsuit was won by Gaud\u00ed in 1916, and he gave the 105,000 pesetas he won in the case to charity, stating that \"the principles mattered more than money.\" Mil\u00e0 was having to pay the mortgage.<ref Name=huertas/>\n\nAfter Gaud\u00ed's death in 1926, Segimon got rid of most of the furniture that Gaud\u00ed had designed and covered over parts of Gaud\u00ed's designs with new decorations in the style of [[Louis XVI]]. La Pedrera was acquired in 1986 by {{ill|Caixa Catalunya|ca||es}} and when restoration was done four years later, some of the original decorations re-emerged.<ref Name=permanyer/>\n\nWhen the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] broke out in July 1936, the Mil\u00e0s were on vacation.

It is easier to identify them by looking at the total mass of both the antiparticle and particle.

From top to bottom; [[electron]]/[[positron]], [[proton]]/[[antiproton]], [[neutron]]/[[antineutron]].]]\n\nIn [[particle physics]], every type of [[particle]] has an associated '''antiparticle''' with the same [[mass]] but with opposite [[charge (physics)|physical charges]] (such as [[electric charge]]). For example, the antiparticle of the [[electron]] is the [[antielectron]] (which is often referred to as ''positron''). While the electron has a negative electric charge, the positron has a positive electric charge, and is produced naturally in certain types of [[radioactive decay]].  The opposite is also true: the antiparticle of the positron is the electron.\n\nSome particles, such as the [[photon]], are their own antiparticle. Otherwise, for each pair of antiparticle partners, one is designated as normal matter (the kind we are made of), and the other (usually given the prefix \"anti-\") as ''[[antimatter]]''.\n\nParticle\u2013antiparticle pairs can [[particle annihilation|annihilate]] each other, producing [[photon]]s; since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite, total charge is conserved. For example, the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons, producing pairs of [[gamma ray]]s, a process exploited in [[positron emission tomography]].\n\nThe laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles. For example, an [[antiproton]] and a [[positron]] can form an [[antihydrogen]] [[atom]], which is believed to have the same properties as a [[hydrogen]] atom. This leads to the question of why the [[baryogenesis|formation of matter after the Big Bang]] resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter, rather than being a half-and-half mixture of matter and [[antimatter]]. The discovery of [[CP violation|Charge Parity violation]] helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry, originally thought to be perfect, was only approximate.\n\nBecause [[Charge (physics)|charge]] is [[Charge conservation|conserved]], it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying another particle of the same charge (as is for instance the case when antiparticles are produced naturally via [[beta decay]] or the collision of [[cosmic ray]]s with Earth's atmosphere), or by the simultaneous creation of both a particle ''and'' its antiparticle, which can occur in [[particle accelerator]]s such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].\n\nAlthough particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges, electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles. The neutron, for example, is made out of [[quark]]s, the [[antineutron]] from [[Quark#Antiquarks|antiquarks]], and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact. However, other neutral particles are their own antiparticles, such as [[photon]]s, [[W and Z bosons#Z boson|Z<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;bosons]], [[Pi meson|{{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}]]&nbsp;[[meson]]s, and hypothetical [[graviton]]s and some hypothetical [[Weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]]s.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Experiment ===\n\nIn 1932, soon after the prediction of [[positron]]s by [[Paul Dirac]], [[Carl D. Anderson]] found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a [[cloud chamber]]\u2014 a [[particle detector]] in which moving [[electron]]s (or positrons) leave behind trails as they move through the gas. The electric charge-to-mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud-chamber track in a [[magnetic field]]. Positrons, because of the direction that their paths curled, were at first mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction.  Positron paths in a cloud-chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to their having the same magnitude of charge-to-mass ratio but with opposite charge and, therefore, opposite signed charge-to-mass ratios.\n\nThe [[antiproton]] and [[antineutron]] were found by [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]] and [[Owen Chamberlain]] in 1955 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Since then, the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments. In recent years, complete atoms of [[antimatter]] have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons, collected in electromagnetic traps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/11/101118-antimatter-trapped-engines-bombs-nature-science-cern/|title=Antimatter Atoms Trapped for First Time\u2014\"A Big Deal\"|date=19 November 2010|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Dirac hole theory ===\n{{quote box|quote=... the development of [[quantum field theory]] made the interpretation of antiparticles as holes unnecessary, even though it lingers on in many textbooks.|source=[[Steven Weinberg]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steve|title=The quantum theory of fields, Volume 1 : Foundations|isbn=0-521-55001-7|pages=14}}</ref>|width=300px}}\nSolutions of the [[Dirac equation]] contained{{clarify|date=September 2015}} negative energy quantum states. As a result, an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state. Even worse, it could keep radiating infinite amounts of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available. To prevent this unphysical situation from happening, Dirac proposed that a \"sea\" of negative-energy electrons fills the universe, already occupying all of the lower-energy states so that, due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], no other electron could fall into them. Sometimes, however, one of these negative-energy particles could be lifted out of this [[Dirac sea]] to become a positive-energy particle. But, when lifted out, it would leave behind a ''[[electron hole|hole]]'' in the sea that would act exactly like a positive-energy electron with a reversed charge. These holes were interpreted as \"negative-energy electrons\" by Paul Dirac and by mistake he identified them with [[proton]]s in his 1930 paper ''A Theory of Electrons and Protons''<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Dirac |first1=Paul\n |date=1930\n |title=A Theory of Electrons and Protons\n |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]\n |volume=126 |issue= 801|pages=360\u2013365\n |doi=10.1098/rspa.1930.0013\n|bibcode = 1930RSPSA.126..360D |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/126/801/360.full.pdf}}</ref> However, these \"negative-energy electrons\" turned out to be [[positron]]s, and not [[proton]]s.\n\nThis picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universe\u2014a problem of which Dirac was aware. Dirac tried{{clarify|date=September 2015}} to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge. Another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton. Dirac tried{{clarify|date=September 2015}} to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea, until [[Hermann Weyl]] proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges. Dirac also predicted a reaction {{Subatomic particle|Electron}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Proton+}}&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}}, where an electron and a proton annihilate to give two photons. [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Igor Tamm]] proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast. A year later, in 1931, Dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron, a new particle of the same mass as the electron. The discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory.\n\nHowever, the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains.{{why|date=September 2015}} Also, as we now know, [[bosons]] also have antiparticles, but since bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (only [[fermion]]s do), hole theory does not work for them. A unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in [[quantum field theory]], which solves both these problems.{{how|date=September 2015}}\n\n== Particle\u2013antiparticle annihilation ==\n{{main|Annihilation}}\n[[Image:kkbar had.svg|frame|alt=Feynman diagram of a kaon oscillation.

In quantum field theory, this process is allowed only as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the [[uncertainty principle]]. This opens the way for virtual pair production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may ''fluctuate'' into a two particle state and back. These processes are important in the [[vacuum state]] and [[renormalization]] of a quantum field theory. It also opens the way for neutral particle mixing through processes such as the one pictured here, which is a complicated example of [[mass renormalization]].\n\n== Properties ==\n\n[[Quantum state]]s of a particle and an antiparticle can be interchanged by applying the [[C-symmetry|charge conjugation]] (C), [[P-symmetry|parity]] (P), and [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] (T) operators. If <math>|p,\\sigma ,n \\rangle </math> denotes the quantum state of a particle (n) with momentum p, spin J whose component in the z-direction is \u03c3, then one has\n::<math>CPT \\ |p,\\sigma,n \\rangle\\ =\\ (-1)^{J-\\sigma}\\ |p,-\\sigma,n^c \\rangle ,</math>\nwhere n<sup>c</sup> denotes the charge conjugate state, that is, the antiparticle. This behaviour under [[CPT symmetry]] is the same as the statement that the particle and its antiparticle lie in the same [[irreducible representation]] of the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]]. Properties of antiparticles can be related to those of particles through this. If T is a good symmetry of the dynamics, then\n::<math>T\\ |p,\\sigma,n\\rangle \\ \\propto \\ |-p,-\\sigma,n\\rangle ,</math>\n::<math>CP\\ |p,\\sigma,n\\rangle \\ \\propto \\ |-p,\\sigma,n^c\\rangle ,</math>\n::<math>C\\ |p,\\sigma,n\\rangle \\ \\propto \\ |p,\\sigma,n^c\\rangle ,</math>\nwhere the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side. In other words, particle and antiparticle must have\n*the same mass m\n*the same spin state J\n*opposite [[electric charge]]s q and -q.\n\n== Quantum field theory ==\n:''This section draws upon the ideas, language and notation of [[canonical quantization]] of a [[quantum field theory]].''\n\nOne may try to quantize an electron [[field (physics)|field]] without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing\n\n::<math>\\psi (x)=\\sum_{k}u_k (x)a_k e^{-iE(k)t},\\,</math>\n\nwhere we use the symbol ''k'' to denote the quantum numbers ''p'' and \u03c3 of the previous section and the sign of the energy, ''E(k)'', and ''a<sub>k</sub>'' denotes the corresponding annihilation operators. Of course, since we are dealing with [[fermion]]s, we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations. However, if one now writes down the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]\n\n::<math>H=\\sum_{k} E(k) a^\\dagger_k a_k,\\,</math>\n\nthen one sees immediately that the expectation value of ''H'' need not be positive. This is because ''E(k)'' can have any sign whatsoever, and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0.\n\nSo one has to introduce the charge conjugate ''antiparticle'' field, with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations\n\n::<math>b_{k\\prime} = a^\\dagger_k\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ b^\\dagger_{k\\prime}=a_k,\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' has the same ''p'', and opposite \u03c3 and sign of the energy. Then one can rewrite the field in the form\n\n::<math>\\psi(x)=\\sum_{k_+} u_k (x)a_k e^{-iE(k)t}+\\sum_{k_-} u_k (x)b^\\dagger _k e^{-iE(k)t},\\,</math>\n\nwhere the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy. The energy becomes\n\n::<math>H=\\sum_{k_+} E_k a^\\dagger _k a_k + \\sum_{k_-} |E(k)|b^\\dagger_k b_k + E_0,\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''E<sub>0</sub>'' is an infinite negative constant. The [[vacuum state]] is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle, ''i.e.'', <math>a_k |0\\rangle=0</math> and <math>b_k |0\\rangle=0</math>. Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly ''E<sub>0</sub>''. Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum, '''H''' is positive definite. Analysis of the properties of ''a<sub>k</sub>'' and ''b<sub>k</sub>'' shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles. This is the case of a [[fermion]].\n\nThis approach is due to [[Vladimir Fock]], [[Wendell Furry]] and [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. If one quantizes a real [[Scalar field theory|scalar field]], then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator; therefore, real scalar fields describe neutral bosons. Since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators, which are related by conjugation, such fields describe charged bosons.\n\n=== Feynman\u2013Stueckelberg interpretation <!--'[[Feynman\u2013Stueckelberg interpretation]]', '[[Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation]]', '[[Stueckelberg\u2013Feynman interpretation]]', '[[Stueckelberg-Feynman interpretation]]', '[[Feynman\u2013St\u00fcckelberg interpretation]]', '[[Feynman-St\u00fcckelberg interpretation]]', '[[St\u00fcckelberg\u2013Feynman interpretation]]', and '[[St\u00fcckelberg-Feynman interpretation]]' redirect here-->===\n\nBy considering the propagation of the negative energy modes of the electron field backward in time, [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] reached a pictorial understanding of the fact that the particle and antiparticle have equal mass '''m''' and spin '''J''' but opposite charges '''q'''. This allowed him to rewrite [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] precisely in the form of diagrams. [[Richard Feynman]] later gave an independent systematic derivation of these diagrams from a particle formalism, and they are now called [[Feynman diagram]]s. Each line of a diagram represents a particle propagating either backward or forward in time. This technique is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in quantum field theory today.\n\nSince this picture was first developed by Stueckelberg,<ref>Stueckelberg, Ernst (1941), \"La signification du temps propre en m\u00e9canique ondulatoire.\" ''Helv.

In [[propositional logic]], '''associativity''' is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of replacement]] for [[well-formed formula|expressions]] in [[Formal proof|logical proofs]].\n\nWithin an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the [[operand]]s is not changed. That is, rearranging the [[parentheses]] in such an expression will not change its value. Consider the following equations:\n\n:<math>(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9 \\,</math>\n\n:<math>2 \\times (3 \\times 4) = (2 \\times 3) \\times 4 = 24 .</math>\n\nEven though the parentheses were rearranged on each line, the values of the expressions were not altered. Since this holds true when performing addition and multiplication on any [[real number]]s, it can be said that \"addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative operations\".\n\nAssociativity is not the same as [[commutativity]], which addresses whether or not the order of two [[operand]]s changes the result. For example, the order does not matter in the multiplication of real numbers, that is, {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' = ''b'' \u00d7 ''a''}}, so we say that the multiplication of real numbers is a commutative operation.\n\nAssociative operations are abundant in mathematics; in fact, many [[algebraic structure]]s (such as [[semigroup (mathematics)|semigroups]] and [[category (mathematics)|categories]]) explicitly require their binary operations to be associative.\n\nHowever, many important and interesting operations are non-associative; some examples include [[subtraction]], [[exponentiation]], and the [[vector cross product]].  In contrast to the theoretical properties of real numbers, the addition of [[floating point]] numbers in computer science is not associative, and the choice of how to associate an expression can have a significant effect on rounding error.\n\n== Definition ==\n[[File:Semigroup_associative.svg|thumbnail|A binary operation \u2217 on the set ''S'' is associative when [[Commutative diagram|this diagram commutes]].

For instance, a product of four elements may be written in five possible ways:\n\n# ((ab)c)d\n# (ab)(cd)\n# (a(bc))d\n# a((bc)d)\n# a(b(cd))\n\nIf the product operation is associative, the generalized associative law says that all these formulas will yield the same result, making the parenthesis unnecessary. Thus \"the\" product can be written unambiguously as\n\n:abcd.\n\nAs the number of elements increases, the [[Catalan number#Applications in combinatorics|number of possible ways to insert parentheses]] grows quickly, but they remain unnecessary for disambiguation.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Associativity of binary operations (without question marks).svg|thumb|In associative operations is <math>(x\\circ y)\\circ z = x\\circ(y\\circ z)</math>.]]\n[[File:Associativity of real number addition.svg|thumb|The addition of real numbers is associative.]]\nSome examples of associative operations include the following.\n\n* The [[string concatenation|concatenation]] of the three strings <code>\"hello\"</code>, <code>\" \"</code>, <code>\"world\"</code> can be computed by concatenating the first two strings (giving <code>\"hello \"</code>) and appending the third string (<code>\"world\"</code>), or by joining the second and third string (giving <code>\" world\"</code>) and concatenating the first string (<code>\"hello\"</code>) with the result. The two methods produce the same result; string concatenation is associative (but not commutative).\n* In [[arithmetic]], [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s are associative; i.e.,\n:: <math>\n\\left.\n\\begin{matrix}\n(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)=x+y+z\\quad\n\\\\\n(x\\,y)z=x(y\\,z)=x\\,y\\,z\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\ \\ \\,\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n\\mbox{for all }x,y,z\\in\\mathbb{R}.\n</math>\n:Because of associativity, the grouping parentheses can be omitted without ambiguity.\n* The trivial operation {{math|1=''x'' \u2217 ''y'' = ''x''}} (that is, the result is the first argument, no matter what the second argument is) is associative but not commutative.\n* Addition and multiplication of [[complex number]]s and [[quaternion]]s are associative. Addition of [[octonion]]s is also associative, but multiplication of octonions is non-associative.\n* The [[greatest common divisor]] and [[least common multiple]] functions act associatively.\n:: <math>\n\n\\left.\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{gcd}(\\operatorname{gcd}(x,y),z)=\n\\operatorname{gcd}(x,\\operatorname{gcd}(y,z))=\n\\operatorname{gcd}(x,y,z)\\ \\quad\n\\\\\n\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{lcm}(x,y),z)=\n\\operatorname{lcm}(x,\\operatorname{lcm}(y,z))=\n\\operatorname{lcm}(x,y,z)\\quad\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\\mbox{ for all }x,y,z\\in\\mathbb{Z}.\n</math>\n* Taking the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] or the [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]:\n:: <math>\n\n\\left.\n\\begin{matrix}\n(A\\cap B)\\cap C=A\\cap(B\\cap C)=A\\cap B\\cap C\\quad\n\\\\\n(A\\cup B)\\cup C=A\\cup(B\\cup C)=A\\cup B\\cup C\\quad\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\\mbox{for all sets }A,B,C.\n</math>\n* If ''M'' is some set and ''S'' denotes the set of all functions from ''M'' to ''M'', then the operation of [[function composition]] on ''S'' is associative:\n\n:: <math>(f\\circ g)\\circ h=f\\circ(g\\circ h)=f\\circ g\\circ h\\qquad\\mbox{for all }f,g,h\\in S.</math>\n* Slightly more generally, given four sets ''M'', ''N'', ''P'' and ''Q'', with ''h'': ''M'' to ''N'', ''g'': ''N'' to ''P'', and ''f'': ''P'' to ''Q'', then\n\n:: <math>(f\\circ g)\\circ h=f\\circ(g\\circ h)=f\\circ g\\circ h</math>\n\n: as before. In short, composition of maps is always associative.\n* Consider a set with three elements, A, B, and C. The following operation:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! \u00d7 !! A !! B !! C\n|-\n! A\n| A || A || A\n|-\n! B\n| A || B || C\n|-\n! C\n| A || A || A\n|-\n|}\n\n:is associative. Thus, for example, A(BC)=(AB)C = A. This operation is not commutative.\n* Because [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] represent [[linear map|linear function]]s, and [[matrix multiplication]] represents function composition, one can immediately conclude that matrix multiplication is associative. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations/composition-of-transformations/v/matrix-product-associativity|title=Matrix product associativity|publisher=Khan Academy|accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Propositional logic ==\n\n=== Rule of replacement ===\nIn standard truth-functional propositional logic, ''association'',<ref>Moore and Parker{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}}</ref><ref>Copi and Cohen{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}}</ref> or ''associativity''<ref>Hurley{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}}</ref> are two [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of replacement|rules of replacement]].

One area within [[non-associative algebra]] that has grown very large is that of [[Lie algebra]]s. There the associative law is replaced by the [[Jacobi identity]]. Lie algebras abstract the essential nature of [[infinitesimal transformation]]s, and have become ubiquitous in mathematics.\n\nThere are other specific types of non-associative structures that have been studied in depth; these tend to come from some specific applications or areas such as [[combinatorial mathematics]]. Other examples are [[Quasigroup]], [[Quasifield]], [[Non-associative ring]], [[Non-associative algebra]] and [[Commutative non-associative magmas]].\n\n===Nonassociativity of floating point calculation===\n\nIn mathematics, addition and multiplication of real numbers is associative.

However, [[mathematician]]s agree on a particular order of evaluation for several common non-associative operations. This is simply a notational convention to avoid parentheses.\n\nA '''left-associative''' operation is a non-associative operation that is conventionally evaluated from left to right, i.e.,\n:<math>\n\\left.\n\\begin{matrix}\nx*y*z=(x*y)*z\\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\,\n\\\\\nw*x*y*z=((w*x)*y)*z\\quad\n\\\\\n\\mbox{etc.}\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\ \\ \\,\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n\\mbox{for all }w,x,y,z\\in S\n</math>\nwhile a '''right-associative''' operation is conventionally evaluated from right to left:\n:<math>\n\\left.\n\\begin{matrix}\nx*y*z=x*(y*z)\\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\,\n\\\\\nw*x*y*z=w*(x*(y*z))\\quad\n\\\\\n\\mbox{etc.}\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\ \\ \\,\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n\\mbox{for all }w,x,y,z\\in S\n</math>\nBoth left-associative and right-associative operations occur.

Covered entities are also required to provide [[reasonable accommodation]]s to job applicants and employees with disabilities.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12112(b)(5)}}</ref> A reasonable accommodation is a change in the way things are typically done that the person needs because of a disability, and can include, among other things, special equipment that allows the person to perform the job, scheduling changes, and changes to the way work assignments are chosen or communicated.<ref>{{cite web |author1=EEOC |title=EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html |website=EEOC.gov}}</ref> An employer is not required to provide an accommodation that would involve undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense), and the individual who receives the accommodation must still perform the essential functions of the job and meet the normal performance requirements. An employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12111}}</ref>\n\nThere are many ways to discriminate against people based on disabilities, including psychological ones. Anyone known to have a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled. Employers with more than 15 employees must take care to treat all employees fairly and with any accommodations needed. Even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well, she or he is not necessarily no longer disabled; employers must continue to follow all policies for the disabled.\n\nPart of Title I was found unconstitutional by the [[United States Supreme Court]] as it pertains to states in the case of ''[[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett]]'' as violating the [[sovereign immunity]] rights of the several states as specified by the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The Court determined that state employees cannot sue their employer for violating ADA rules. State employees can, however, file complaints at the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] or the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], who can sue on their behalf.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Disability Rights in the Supreme Court|url = http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol11_no4/art1p1.html|website = The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|access-date = January 27, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020201040214/http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol11_no4/art1p1.html|archive-date = February 1, 2002|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Title II}} Title II\u2014public entities (and public transportation)===\n{{hatnote|See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12131|12165}}.}}\n[[File:Handicapped Accessible sign.svg|thumb|upright|Access sign]]\n\nTitle II prohibits disability discrimination by all public entities at the local level, ''e.g.'', school district, municipal, city, or county, and at state level. Public entities must comply with Title II regulations by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. These regulations cover access to all programs and services offered by the entity. Access includes physical access described in the ADA Standards for Accessible Design and programmatic access that might be obstructed by discriminatory policies or procedures of the entity.\n\nTitle II applies to public transportation provided by public entities through regulations by the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]]. It includes the [[Amtrak|National Railroad Passenger Corporation]] (Amtrak), along with all other commuter authorities. This section requires the provision of paratransit services by public entities that provide fixed route services. ADA also sets minimum requirements for space layout in order to facilitate wheelchair securement on public transport.<ref>'Wheelchair Securement in Public Transport', http://thequantumleap.com/faq/</ref>\n\nTitle II also applies to all state and local public housing, housing assistance, and housing referrals. The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] is charged with enforcing this provision.\n\n==={{anchor|Title III}}Title III\u2014public accommodations (and commercial facilities)===\n{{hatnote|See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12181|12189}}.}}\n[[File:Drano Lake accessible fishing platform signage.jpg|thumb|The ADA sets standards for construction of accessible public facilities. Shown is a sign indicating an accessible fishing platform at [[Drano Lake]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].]]\nUnder Title III, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal [[enjoyment]] of the goods, services, facilities, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation. Public accommodations include most places of lodging (such as inns and hotels), recreation, transportation, education, and dining, along with stores, care providers, and places of public displays.\n\nUnder Title III of the ADA, all new construction (construction, modification or alterations) after the effective date of the ADA (approximately July 1992) must be fully compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG)<ref name=ada90/> found in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] at 28&nbsp;C.F.R., Part 36, Appendix ''A''.\n\nTitle III also has application to existing facilities. One of the definitions of \"discrimination\" under Title III of the ADA is a \"failure to remove\" architectural barriers in existing facilities. See {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|42|12182|b|2|A|iv}}. This means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the ADA was passed still have obligations. The standard is whether \"removing barriers\" (typically defined as bringing a condition into compliance with the ADAAG) is \"readily achievable\", defined as \"...easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense\".\n\nThe statutory definition of \"readily achievable\" calls for a [[balancing test]] between the cost of the proposed \"fix\" and the wherewithal of the business and/or owners of the business. Thus, what might be \"readily achievable\" for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business.\n\nThere are exceptions to this title; many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by Title III. With regard to historic properties (those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]], or properties designated as historic under state or local law), those facilities must still comply with the provisions of Title III of the ADA to the \"maximum extent feasible\" but if following the usual standards would \"threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building\" then alternative standards may be used.\n\nUnder 2010 revisions of Department of Justice regulations, newly constructed or altered swimming pools, wading pools, and spas must have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for disabled people. However, the requirement is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is \"readily achievable\".  Other requirements exist, based on pool size, include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit, which are outlined in Section 242 of the standards. However, businesses are free to consider the differences in application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered, or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule. Full compliance may not be required for existing facilities; Section 242 and 1009 of the 2010 Standards outline such exceptions.<ref>{{cite web |title=2013 ADA Pool Lift Compliance Deadline: Has Your Business Complied? |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/2013-ada-pool-lift-compliance-deadline-has-your-business-complied |work=The National Law Review |publisher=Lowndes, Drosdick, Doster, Kantor & Reed, P.A. |date=January 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Service animals ====\nThe ADA provides explicit coverage for service animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html|title=Americans with Disabilities Act Questions and Answers:  Service Animals|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> Guidelines have been developed not only to protect persons with disabilities, but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, but they are not allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They cannot ask what the person's disabilities are. A person with a disability cannot be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner can not get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animals would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety, so it would not be a valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premises. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals, nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal to use the bathroom. Lastly, people that require service dogs cannot be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly, for example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities cannot be treated as \"less than\" other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for his/her service animal's damages to the property.\n\n==={{anchor|Title IV}}Title IV\u2014telecommunications===\nTitle IV of the ADA amended the landmark [[Communications Act of 1934]] primarily by adding section {{UnitedStatesCode|47|225}}. This section requires that all telecommunications companies in the U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments. When Title IV took effect in the early 1990s, it led to the installation of public [[teletypewriter]] (TTY) machines and other TDD ([[Telecommunications Device for the Deaf|telecommunications devices for the deaf]]). Title IV also led to the creation, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, of what were then called dual-party relay services and now are known as [[Telecommunications Relay Services]] (TRS), such as [[STS relay]]. Today, many TRS-mediated calls are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are [[Video Relay Service]] (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. In either variation, communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.\n\n==={{anchor|Title V}}Title V\u2014miscellaneous provisions===\n{{hatnote|See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12201|12213}}.}}\n\nTitle V includes technical provisions. It discusses, for example, the fact that nothing in the ADA amends, overrides or cancels anything in [[Section 504]].<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12187}}</ref> Additionally, Title V includes an anti-retaliation or coercion provision. The ''Technical Assistance Manual'' for the ADA explains this provision: \n<blockquote>\"III-3.6000 Retaliation or coercion. Individuals who exercise their rights under the ADA, or assist others in exercising their rights, are protected from retaliation. The prohibition against retaliation or coercion applies broadly to any individual or entity that seeks to prevent an individual from exercising his or her rights or to retaliate against him or her for having exercised those rights ... Any form of retaliation or coercion, including threats, intimidation, or interference, is prohibited if it is intended to interfere.\"</blockquote>\n\n==History==\nThe ADA has roots in [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504]] of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Disability Rights Movement: from Charity to Confrontation|last=Fleischer|first=Doris Zames|last2=Zames|first2=Frieda|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=93\u201395|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Drafting===\n[[File:ADA Development of Administration Disability Policy 042189 Page 1.jpg|thumb|Development of George H.W.

The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) was charged with interpreting the 1990 law with regard to discrimination in employment. The EEOC developed regulations limiting an individual's impairment to one that \"severely or significantly restricts\" a major life activity. The ADAAA directed the EEOC to amend its regulations and replace \"severely or significantly\" with \"substantially limits\", a more lenient standard.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet on the EEOC's Final Regulations Implementing the ADAAA |url=http://www1.eeoc.gov//laws/regulations/adaaa_fact_sheet.cfm?renderforprint=1 |website=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn September 25, 2008, President [[George W.

Moreover, there may be a benefit to these \"private attorneys general\" who identify and compel the correction of illegal conditions: they may increase the number of public accommodations accessible to persons with disabilities. \"Civil rights law depends heavily on private enforcement.

The two plaintiffs L.C. and E.W. were institutionalized in Georgia for diagnosed mental retardation and schizophrenia. Clinical assessments by the state determined that the plaintiffs could be appropriately treated in a community setting rather than the state institution. The plaintiffs sued the state of Georgia and the institution for being inappropriately treated and housed in the institutional setting rather than being treated in one of the state's community based treatment facilities.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided under Title II of the ADA that mental illness is a form of disability and therefore covered under the ADA, and that unjustified institutional isolation of a person with a disability is a form of discrimination because it \"...perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.\" The court added, \"Confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.\"\n\nTherefore, under Title II no person with a disability can be unjustly excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs or activities of any public entity.<ref name=Olmstead/>\n\n===''Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America v.

Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers'' (1996) was focused on the wheelchair accessibility of a stadium project that was still in the design phase, MCI Center (now known as [[Capital One Arena]]) in Washington, D.C. Previous to this case, which was filed only five years after the ADA was passed, the DOJ was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces. While Section 4.33.3 of ADAAG makes reference to lines of sight, no specific reference is made to seeing over standing patrons. The MCI Center, designed by Ellerbe Becket Architects & Engineers, was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats, and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing. This case and another related case established precedent on seat distribution and sight lines issues for ADA enforcement that continues to present day.\n\n===''Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams''===\n''[[Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams]]'',<ref name=Toyota>{{ussc|name=Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams|link=|volume=534|page=184|pin=|year=2002}}.</ref> was a case in which the Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the phrase \"substantially impairs\" as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act. It reversed a Sixth Court of Appeals decision to grant a partial [[summary judgment]] in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams, that qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. The Court held that the \"major life activity\" definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living. The issue is not whether Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks, which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that Williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores, such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found that Williams was disabled.<ref name=Toyota/><ref name=\"workerrights\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GGRFPMUFUSkC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=TOYOTA+of+KY+v+Ella+WILLIAMS#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Workers' Rights |publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=October 7, 2009 |last=Worth |first=Richard |isbn=978-0-7614-2574-8 |date=November 15, 2007}}\n</ref> This ruling is now, however, no longer good law\u2014it was invalidated by the ADAAA.

Barnett'' ===\nDecided by the US Supreme Court in 2002, this case <ref name=\"USABARN\">{{ussc|name=US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett|link=|volume=535|page=391|pin=|year=2002}}.</ref> held that even requests for accommodation that might seem reasonable on their face, e.g., a transfer to a different position, can be rendered unreasonable because it would require a violation of the company's seniority system.  While the court held that, in general, a violation of a seniority system renders an otherwise reasonable accommodation unreasonable, a plaintiff can present evidence that, despite the seniority system, the accommodation is reasonable in the specific case at hand, e.g., the plaintiff could offer evidence that the seniority system is so often disregarded that another exception wouldn't make a difference.\n\nImportantly, the court held that the defendant need not provide proof that this particular application of the seniority system should prevail, and that, once the defendant showed that the accommodation violated the seniority system, it fell to Barnett to show it was nevertheless reasonable.\n\nIn this case, Barnett was a US Airways employee who injured his back, rendering him physically unable to perform his cargo-handling job.  Invoking seniority, he transferred to a less-demanding mailroom job, but this position later became open to seniority-based bidding and was bid on by more senior employees.  Barnett requested the accommodation of being allowed to stay on in the less-demanding mailroom job.  US Airways denied his request, and he lost his job.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision invalidated both the approach of the district court, which found that the mere presence and importance of the seniority system was enough to warrant a summary judgment in favor of US Airways, as well as the circuit court's approach that interpreted 'reasonable accommodation' as 'effective accommodation.'\n\n===''Access Now v.

Then, Steve Jobs suggested that they design and sell a single etched and silkscreened circuit board&mdash;just the bare board, no electronic parts&mdash;that people could use to build the computers. Wozniak calculated that having the board design laid out would cost $1,000 and manufacturing would cost another $20 per board; he hoped to recoup his costs if 50 people bought the boards for $40 each. To fund this small venture, their first company, Jobs sold his van and Wozniak sold his [[HP-65]] calculator. Very soon after, Steve Jobs arranged to sell \"something like 50\" completely built computers to the [[Paul Terrell|Byte Shop]] (a computer store in Mountain View, California) at $500 each.

[[Othniel Charles Marsh]] described and named the first-known species, '''''A. ajax''''', in 1877, and a second species, '''''A. louisae''''', was discovered and named by William H. Holland in 1916. ''Apatosaurus'' lived about 152 to 151 million years ago (mya), during the late [[Kimmeridgian]] to early [[Tithonian]] age, and are now known from [[fossil]]s in the [[Morrison Formation]] of modern-day [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]], [[New Mexico]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Utah]] in the United States. ''Apatosaurus'' had an average length of {{convert|21|-|22.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and an average mass of {{convert|16.4|-|22.4|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}. A few specimens indicate a maximum length of 11\u201330% greater than average and a mass of {{convert|32.7|-|72.6|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe [[cervical vertebrae]] of ''Apatosaurus'' are less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of ''[[Diplodocus]]'', a [[diplodocid]] like ''Apatosaurus'', and the bones of the leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that ''Apatosaurus'' was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. ''Apatosaurus'' had a single [[claw]] on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The ''Apatosaurus'' skull, long thought to be similar to ''[[Camarasaurus]]'', is much more similar to that of ''Diplodocus''. ''Apatosaurus'' was a generalized [[browsing (herbivory)|browser]] that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, ''Apatosaurus'' had [[air sacs]] that made the bones internally full of holes. Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises.\n\nThe skull of ''Apatosaurus'' was confused with that of ''Camarasaurus'' and ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' until 1909, when the [[holotype]] of ''A. louisae'' was found, and a complete skull just a few meters away from the front of the neck. [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] disagreed with this association, and went on to mount a skeleton of ''Apatosaurus'' with a ''Camarasaurus'' skull cast. Until 1970, ''Apatosaurus'' skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts, when McIntosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to ''Diplodocus'' were more likely from ''Apatosaurus''.\n\n''Apatosaurus'' is a genus in the family Diplodocidae. It is one of the more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] genera, with only ''[[Amphicoelias]]'' and possibly a new, unnamed genus more primitive. While the subfamily [[Apatosaurinae]] was named in 1929, the group was not used [[valid name (zoology)|validly]] until an extensive 2015 study. Only ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' is also in the subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as [[diplodocinae|diplodocines]]. ''Brontosaurus'' has long been considered a [[junior synonym]] of ''Apatosaurus''; its only species was reclassified as ''A.{{nbsp}}excelsus'' in 1903. A 2015 study concluded that ''Brontosaurus'' is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from ''Apatosaurus'', but not all paleontologists agree with this division. As it existed in North America during the late Jurassic, ''Apatosaurus'' would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''Camarasaurus'', ''Diplodocus'', and ''[[Stegosaurus]]''.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Apatosaurus scale mmartyniuk wiki.png|thumb|left|Comparison of ''A. ajax'' (orange) and ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae'' (red) with a human (blue) and ''[[Brontosaurus parvus]]'' (green)]]\n''Apatosaurus'' was a large, long-necked, [[quadruped]]al animal with a long, whip-like tail. Its [[forelimb]]s were slightly shorter than its [[hindlimb]]s. Most size estimates are based on specimen [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History|CM]]{{nbsp}}3018, the [[type (biology)|type specimen]] of ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae''. In 1936 this was measured to be {{convert|21.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, by measuring the [[vertebral column]].<ref name=\"gilmore36\"/> Current estimates are similar, finding that the individual was {{convert|21|-|22.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and had a mass of {{convert|16.4|-|22.4|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Seebacher01/><ref name=\"mazzettaetal2004\"/><ref name=henderson/> A 2015 study that estimated the mass of volumetric models of ''[[Dreadnoughtus]]'', ''Apatosaurus'', and ''[[Giraffatitan]]'' estimates CM{{nbsp}}3018 at {{convert|21.8|-|38.2|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}, similar in mass to ''Dreadnoughtus''.<ref name=\"bates&falkingham2015\"/> Past estimates have put the creature's mass as high as {{convert|35.0|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Seebacher01/> Some specimens of ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' (such as [[Oklahoma Museum of Natural History|OMNH]]{{nbsp}}1670) represent individuals 11{{ndash}}30% longer, suggesting masses twice that of CM{{nbsp}}3018 or {{convert|32.7|-|72.6|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}, potentially rivalling the largest [[titanosaur]]s.<ref name=\"wedel2013\"/>\n[[File:Apatosaurus ajax skull.jpg|thumb|''A. ajax'' skull, specimen CMC VP 7180]]\n\nThe skull is small in relation to the size of the animal. The jaws are lined with spatulate (chisel-like) teeth suited to an [[herbivore|herbivorous]] diet.<ref name=\"fastovsky\"/> The snout of ''Apatosaurus'' and similar [[diplodocoidea|diplodocoids]] is squared, with only ''[[Nigersaurus]]'' having a squarer skull.<ref name=\"whitlock11\"/> The braincase of ''Apatosaurus'' is well preserved in specimen BYU{{nbsp}}17096, which also preserved much of the skeleton. A phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids.<ref name=\"balanoff2010\"/> Some skulls of ''Apatosaurus'' have been found still in articulation with their teeth. Those teeth that have the [[tooth enamel|enamel]] surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface; instead, they display a sugary texture and little wear.<ref name=\"whitlock11\"/>\n[[File:Apatosaurus ajax holotype cervical.png|thumb|left|Cervical vertebra of ''A. ajax'' (holotype, [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YPM]] 1860) in side and anterior view]]\nLike those of other sauropods, the neck vertebrae are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck.<ref name=\"fastovsky\"/> The vertebral formula for the holotype of ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae'' is 15{{nbsp}}cervicals, 10{{nbsp}}[[thoracic vertebrae|dorsals]], 5{{nbsp}}[[Sacrum#Other animals|sacrals]], and 82{{nbsp}}[[Vertebra#Other animals|caudals]]. The caudal vertebra number may vary, even within species.<ref name=\"gilmore36\"/> The cervical vertebrae of ''Apatosaurus'' and ''Brontosaurus'' are stouter and more robust than those of other [[diplodocid]]s and were found to be most similar to ''Camarasaurus'' by [[Charles Whitney Gilmore]].<ref name=\"gilmore36\"/><ref name=\"twne15\"/> In addition, they support [[Cervical rib#Other animals|cervical ribs]] that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section.<ref name=\"twne15\"/> In ''Apatosaurus louisae'', the [[atlas (anatomy)|atlas]]-[[axis (anatomy)|axis]] complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated.<ref name=\"gilmore36\"/> ''Apatosaurus'' has ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body.<ref name=\"riggs-1903\"/> The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. ''Apatosaurus'', like its close relative ''[[Supersaurus]]'', has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips. ''Apatosaurus'' also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest.<ref name=LHW07/> As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end.<ref name=\"gilmore36\"/>\n\n[[File:Apatosaurus louisae by durbed.jpg|thumb|[[Paleoart|Artistic interpretation]] of ''A. louisae'']]\nThe limb bones are also very robust.<ref name=LHW07/> Within [[Apatosaurinae]], the [[scapula]] of ''Apatosaurus louisae'' is intermediate in morphology between those of ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' and ''Brontosaurus excelsus''. The arm bones are stout, so the [[humerus]] of ''Apatosaurus'' resembles that of ''Camarasaurus'', as well as ''Brontosaurus''. However, the humeri of ''Brontosaurus'' and ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' are more similar to each other than they are to ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae''. In 1936 [[Charles W. Gilmore|Charles Gilmore]] noted that previous reconstructions of ''Apatosaurus'' forelimbs erroneously proposed that the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] could cross; in life they would have remained parallel.<ref name=\"gilmore36\"/> ''Apatosaurus'' had a single large claw on each forelimb, a feature shared by all sauropods more derived than ''[[Shunosaurus]]''.<ref name=\"gilmore36\"/><ref name=\"upchurchmanus\"/> The first three toes had claws on each hindlimb.

Two years later, Marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen at [[Como Bluff]], [[Wyoming]].

Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age to those of the Como Bluff in Wyoming from which Marsh had described ''Brontosaurus''. Most of the skeleton was found, and after comparison with both ''Brontosaurus'' and ''Apatosaurus ajax'', Riggs realized that the holotype of ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' was immature, and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid. Since ''Apatosaurus'' was the earlier name, ''Brontosaurus'' should be considered a junior synonym of ''Apatosaurus''. Because of this, Riggs recombined ''Brontosaurus excelsus'' as ''Apatosaurus excelsus''.

According to them, many skulls long thought to pertain to ''Diplodocus'' might instead be those of ''Apatosaurus''. They reassigned multiple skulls to ''Apatosaurus'' based on associated and closely associated vertebrae.

According to the rules of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name ''Apatosaurus'', having been published first, has priority as the official name; ''Brontosaurus'' was considered a [[synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]] and was therefore long discarded from formal use.<ref name=\"taylor10\"/><ref name=\"endeavour\"/><ref name=\"Dinosauria04\"/><ref name=\"Macintosh\"/> Despite this, at least one paleontologist{{snd}}[[Robert T. Bakker]]{{snd}}argued in the 1990s that ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' and ''A.{{nbsp}}excelsus'' were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus.<ref name=\"Bakker98\"/>\n\nIn 2015 Emanuel Tschopp, [[Oct\u00e1vio Mateus]], and Roger Benson released a paper on diplodocoid systematics, and proposed that genera could be diagnosed by thirteen differing characters, and species separated based on six. The minimum number for generic separation was chosen based on the fact that ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' and ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae'' differ in twelve characters, and ''Diplodocus carnegiei'' and ''D.{{nbsp}}hallorum'' differ in eleven characters. Thus, thirteen characters were chosen to validate the separation of genera. The six differing features for specific separation were chosen by counting the number of differing features in separate specimens generally agreed to represent one species, with only one differing character in ''D.{{nbsp}}carnegiei'' and ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae'', but five differing features in ''B.{{nbsp}}excelsus''. Therefore, Tschopp et{{nbsp}}al. argued that ''Apatosaurus excelsus'', originally classified as ''Brontosaurus excelsus'', had enough morphological differences from other species of ''Apatosaurus'' that it warranted being reclassified as a separate genus again. The conclusion was based on a comparison of 477 morphological characteristics across 81 different dinosaur individuals. Among the many notable differences are the wider{{snd}}and presumably stronger{{snd}}neck of ''Apatosaurus'' species compared to ''B.{{nbsp}}excelsus''. Other species previously assigned to ''Apatosaurus'', such as ''Elosaurus parvus'' and ''Eobrontosaurus yahnahpin'' were also reclassified as ''Brontosaurus''. Some features proposed to separate ''Brontosaurus'' from ''Apatosaurus'' include: posterior dorsal vertebrae with the centrum longer than wide; the scapula rear to the [[acromion|acromial edge]] and the distal blade being excavated; the acromial edge of the distal scapular blade bearing a rounded expansion; and the ratio of the proximodistal length to transverse breadth of the [[Talus bone|astragalus]] 0.55 or greater.<ref name=TMB2015/> Sauropod expert [[Michael Daniel D'Emic]] pointed out that the criteria chosen were to an extent arbitrary and that they would require abandoning the name ''Brontosaurus'' again if newer analyses obtained different results.<ref name=\"d'emic 2015\">D'Emic, M. 2015.

Marsh named as many species as he could, which resulted in many being based upon fragmentary and indistinguishable remains. In 2005 Paul Upchurch and colleagues published a study that analyzed the species and specimen relationships of ''Apatosaurus''. They found that ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae'' was the most basal species, followed by FMNH{{nbsp}}P25112, and then a [[polytomy]] of ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'', ''A.{{nbsp}}parvus'', and ''A.{{nbsp}}excelsus''.<ref name=\"Upchurch05\"/> Their analysis was revised and expanded with many additional diplodocid specimens in 2015, which resolved the relationships of ''Apatosaurus'' slightly differently, and also supported separating ''Brontosaurus'' from ''Apatosaurus''.<ref name=TMB2015/>\n\n*'''''Apatosaurus ajax''''' was named by Marsh in 1877 after [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], a hero from Greek mythology.<ref name=\"carpenter&currie92\"/> Marsh designated the incomplete, juvenile skeleton YPM{{nbsp}}1860 as its [[holotype]].

More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now thought to have been fully terrestrial animals.<ref name=\"Pierson\"/> A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square [[snout]], large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of the teeth of ''Apatosaurus'' suggests it was a ground-height, nonselective [[browsing (herbivory)|browser]].<ref name=\"whitlock11\"/> It may have eaten [[fern]]s, [[cycadeoid]]s, [[seed fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s, and [[algae]].<ref name=\"StevensParrish99\"/> Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.<ref name=\"stevens05\"/>\n\nA 2015 study of the necks of ''Apatosaurus'' and ''Brontosaurus'' found many differences between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may have shown that the necks of ''Apatosaurus'' and ''Brontosaurus'' were used for [[intraspecific combat]].<ref name=\"twne15\"/> Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that they were used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.<ref name=\"upchurchmanus\"/>\n\nTrackways of sauropods like ''Apatosaurus'' show that they may have had a range of around {{convert|25|-|40|km|mile|abbr=on}} per day, and that they could potentially have reached a top speed of {{convert|20|-|30|km|mile|abbr=on}} per hour.<ref name=\"fastovsky\"/> The slow locomotion of sauropods may be due to their minimal muscling, or to recoil after strides.<ref name=\"sellers12\"/> A trackway of a juvenile has led some to believe that they were capable of bipedalism, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"smithsonian\"/><ref name=\"bipedalism\"/>\n\n===Neck posture===\n{{further information|Sauropod neck posture}}\n[[File:Apatosaurus33.jpg|thumb|Artistic interpretation of an individual of ''A. louisae'' arching its neck down to drink]]\nDiplodocids like ''Apatosaurus'' are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like ''Apatosaurus'' were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.<ref name=\"StevensParrish99\"/><ref name=\"stevens05\"/><ref name=\"Upchurch2000\"/>\n\nOther studies by Taylor find that all [[tetrapod]]s appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. ''Apatosaurus'', like ''Diplodocus'', would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture.<ref name=\"taylor14\"/><ref name=\"taylor09\"/> Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state ''Apatosaurus'' had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally.<ref name=\"StevensParrish99\"/> The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed at the level of the feet.<ref name=\"stevens05\"/>\n\nMatthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited movement of the neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like ''Diplodocus'' were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs.<ref name=Cobley/><ref name=\"ghose\"/> The conclusions of Cobley et{{nbsp}}al. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of ''Apatosaurus'' and ''Diplodocus''. He found that the neck of ''Apatosaurus'' was very flexible.<ref name=\"taylor14\"/>\n\n===Physiology===\n{{further information|Physiology of dinosaurs}}\n[[File:Apatosaurus caudal vertebrae.png|thumb|Tail vertebrae of specimen FMNH P25112, showing pneumatic fossae (holes)]]\n\nGiven the large body mass and long neck of sauropods like ''Apatosaurus'', physiologists have encountered problems determining how these animals breathed. Beginning with the assumption that, like [[crocodilia]]ns, ''Apatosaurus'' did not have a [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the [[dead space (physiology)|dead-space volume]] (the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth, trachea, and air tubes after each breath) has been estimated at about {{convert|184|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} for a {{convert|30|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} specimen. Paladino calculates its [[lung volumes|tidal volume]] (the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath) at {{convert|904|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} with an avian respiratory system, {{convert|225|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} if mammalian, and {{convert|19|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} if reptilian.<ref name=\"paladinoetal1997\"/>\n\nOn this basis, its respiratory system would likely have been [[parabronchi]], with multiple pulmonary air sacs as in [[avian lungs]], and a flow-through lung. An avian respiratory system would need a lung volume of about {{convert|600|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} compared with a mammalian requirement of {{convert|2,950|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}, which would exceed the space available. The overall thoracic volume of ''Apatosaurus'' has been estimated at {{convert|1,700|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}, allowing for a {{convert|500|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}, four-chambered heart and a {{convert|900|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} lung capacity. That would allow about {{convert|300|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} for the necessary tissue.<ref name=\"paladinoetal1997\"/> Evidence for the avian system in ''Apatosaurus'' and other sauropods is also present in the [[Skeletal pneumaticity|pneumaticity]] of the vertebrae. Though this plays a role in reducing the weight of the animal, Wedel (2003) states they are also likely connected to air sacs, as in birds.<ref name=\"Wedel 2003\"/>\n\nJames Spotila et al. (1991) concludes that the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates because they would not have been able to release enough heat.<ref name=\"spotila91\"/> They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat.<ref name=\"Wedel 2003\"/> Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain.<ref name=\"Pierson\"/> Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.<ref name=\"StevensParrish99\"/>\n\nJames Farlow (1987) calculates that an ''Apatosaurus''-sized dinosaur about {{convert|35|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} would have possessed {{convert|5.7|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} of fermentation contents.<ref name=\"farlow87\"/> Assuming ''Apatosaurus'' had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting-metabolism, Frank Paladino et{{nbsp}}al. (1997) estimate the animal would have needed to consume only about {{convert|262|l|sp=us}} of water per day.<ref name=\"paladinoetal1997\"/>\n\n===Growth===\n[[File:Baby Apatosaurus OMNH.jpg|thumb|left|Juvenile ''A.'' sp. mount, Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History]]\nA 1999 microscopic study of ''Apatosaurus'' and ''Brontosaurus'' bones concluded the animals grew rapidly when young and reached near-adult sizes in about 10{{nbsp}}years.<ref name=Curry99/> In 2008, a study on the growth rates of sauropods was published by Thomas Lehman and Holly Woodward. They said that by using growth lines and length-to-mass ratios, ''Apatosaurus'' would have grown to 25{{nbsp}}t (25 long tons; 28 short tons) in 15{{nbsp}}years, with growth peaking at {{convert|5000|kg|abbr=on|-2}} in a single year. An alternative method, using limb length and body mass, found ''Apatosaurus'' grew {{convert|520|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per year, and reached its full mass before it was about 70{{nbsp}}years old.<ref name=\"lehman&woodward\"/> These estimates have been called unreliable because the calculation methods are not sound; old growth lines would have been obliterated by bone remodelling.<ref name=\"griebeler\"/> One of the first identified growth factors of ''Apatosaurus'' was the number of sacral vertebrae, which increased to five by the time of the creature's maturity. This was first noted in 1903 and again in 1936.<ref name=\"gilmore36\"/>\n\nLong-bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached. A study by Eva Griebeler et{{nbsp}}al. (2013) examined long-bone histological data and concluded the ''Apatosaurus'' sp.{{nbsp}}SMA{{nbsp}}0014 weighed {{convert|20206|kg|ST|1|abbr=on}}, reached sexual maturity at 21{{nbsp}}years, and died aged 28. The same growth model indicated ''Apatosaurus'' sp.{{nbsp}}BYU 601\u201317328 weighed {{convert|18178|kg|ST|1|abbr=on}}, reached sexual maturity at 19{{nbsp}}years, and died aged 31.<ref name=\"griebeler\"/>\n\n====Juveniles====\nCompared with most sauropods, a relatively large amount of juvenile material is known from ''Apatosaurus''. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of ''Apatosaurus''; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish ''Apatosaurus'' from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus.<ref name=\"Upchurch05\"/><ref name=\"carpenter&mcintosh94\"/> Juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.<ref name=\"svpowbabyapato\"/>\n\n===Tail===\nAn article published in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of ''Apatosaurus'' tails by [[Nathan Myhrvold]] and paleontologist [[Philip J. Currie]]. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like ''Apatosaurus'' was a very long, tapering structure resembling a [[bullwhip]]. This computer modeling suggested diplodocids were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 [[decibel]]s, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.<ref name=\"myhrvold\"/>\n\nA pathology has been identified on the tail of ''Apatosaurus'', caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might have been caused by the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints.<ref name=\"lovelace14\"/> It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat and defense, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to ''[[Shunosaurus]]'' and [[mamenchisaurid]]s, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.<ref name=\"myhrvold\">{{cite journal|last1=Myhrvold|first1=N.P.|last2=Currie|first2=P.J.|title=Supersonic sauropods?

The Morrison Basin, where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan; it was formed when the precursors to the [[Front Range]] of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains.<ref name=DAR89/> This formation is similar in age to the [[Lourinh\u00e3 Formation]] in Portugal and the [[Tendaguru Formation]] in Tanzania.<ref name=OM06/>\n\n[[File:Apatosaurus ischium Dinosaur Journey Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Ischium of an ''Apatosaurus'' showing bite marks from a large theropod]]\n''Apatosaurus'' was the second most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after ''Camarasaurus''.<ref name=\"foster-2007\"/> ''Apatosaurus'' may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs.<ref name=DBBM80/> Fossils of the genus have only been found in the upper levels of the formation.

(ed.), ''Vertebrate Paleontology in Utah''. Utah Geological Survey Miscellaneous Publication 99-1.</ref>). The name \"''Allosaurus\"'' means \"different lizard\" alluding to its unique concave vertebrae (at the time of its discovery). It is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}/''allos'' (\"different, other\") and {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}/''sauros'' (\"lizard / generic reptile\"). The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of [[paleontology|paleontological]] circles. Indeed, it has been a top feature in several [[film]]s and [[documentary film|documentaries]] about prehistoric life.\n\n''Allosaurus'' was a large [[biped]]al [[predation|predator]]. Its [[skull]] was large and equipped with dozens of sharp, serrated [[tooth|teeth]]. It averaged {{convert|8.5|m|ft|abbr =on}} in length, though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr =on}}. Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, its three-fingered forelimbs were small, and the body was balanced by a long and heavily muscled tail. It is classified as an [[allosaurid]], a type of [[carnosauria]]n theropod dinosaur. The genus has a complicated [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and includes an uncertain number of valid [[species]], the best known of which is ''A. fragilis''. The bulk of ''Allosaurus'' remains have come from [[North America]]'s [[Morrison Formation]], with material also known from [[Portugal]] and possibly [[Tanzania]]. It was known for over half of the 20th century as ''[[Antrodemus]]'', but a study of the copious remains from the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] brought the name \"''Allosaurus\"'' back to prominence and established it as one of the best-known dinosaurs.\n\nAs the most abundant large predator in the [[Morrison Formation]], ''Allosaurus'' was at the top of the [[food chain]], probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included [[ornithopod]]s, [[stegosaurid]]s, and [[sauropod]]s. Some paleontologists interpret ''Allosaurus'' as having had cooperative [[social behavior]], and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. Due to having a much weaker bite force and a much wider gape than most other large carnivorous dinosaurs, it may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a [[hatchet]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Allosaurus size comparison.svg|thumb|left|The size range of ''Allosaurus'' compared with a human.]]\n''Allosaurus'' was a typical large [[theropod]], having a massive [[skull]] on a short [[neck]], a long [[tail]] and reduced forelimbs.

It came from [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park]], near [[Granby, Colorado]], probably from [[Morrison Formation]] rocks.

[[Robert T. Bakker]], comparing ''Allosaurus'' to [[Cenozoic]] sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although ''Allosaurus'' did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a [[saw]]-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.<ref name=BB98/>\n[[File:Allosaurus Jaws Steveoc86.jpg|thumb|''Allosaurus'' attacking, based on the theories of [[Robert T.

When compared with ''Tyrannosaurus'' and the therizinosaurid ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' in the same study, it was found that ''Allosaurus'' had a wider gape than either; the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 92 degree angle at maximum.

The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among [[vertebrate]]s in general, and modern [[diapsid]] carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalize]] intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple ''Allosaurus'' individuals at the same site, e.g. in the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry|Cleveland\u2013Lloyd Quarry]], are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that ''Allosaurus'' individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like [[crocodile]]s and [[Komodo dragon]]s.

Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or [[animal migration|migration]], resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. ''Allosaurus'' was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that ''Allosaurus'' had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than ''[[Albertosaurus]]'', ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' or ''[[Archaeornithomimus]]''. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones \"were distributed to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] [[phalanges]]\" and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in \"statistically indistinguishable\" numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined ''Allosaurus'' fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in ''Allosaurus'' provide evidence for \"very active\" predation-based rather than scavenging diets.<ref name=\"rothschild-dino\">Rothschild, B., Tanke, D.

operated|gas-operated]], [[7.62\u00d739mm]] [[assault rifle]], developed in the [[Soviet Union]] by [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]]. It is the originating firearm of the [[Kalashnikov rifle]] (or \"AK\") family.\n\nDesign work on the AK-47 began in 1945. In 1946, the AK-47 was presented for official military trials, and in 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the [[Soviet Army]]. An early development of the design was the ''AKS'' (S\u2014''Skladnoy'' or \"folding\"), which was equipped with an underfolding metal [[stock (firearms)|shoulder stock]]. In early 1949, the AK-47 was officially accepted by the [[Soviet Armed Forces]]{{sfnm|Monetchikov|2005|1p=67|Bolotin|1995|2p=129}} and used by the majority of the member states of the [[Warsaw Pact]].\n\nEven after almost seven decades, the model and its variants remain the most popular and widely used assault rifles in the world because of their substantial reliability under harsh conditions, low production costs compared to contemporary Western weapons, availability in virtually every geographic region and ease of use. The AK-47 has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as [[irregular military|irregular forces]] and insurgencies worldwide, and was the basis for developing many other types of individual, crew-served and specialised firearms. {{as of|2004}}, \"Of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s\".<ref name=\"k3\" />\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]] used by [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces made a deep impression on their Soviet counterparts.<ref name=\"Hallock\" /><ref name=\"Gun Book Review\" /> The select-fire rifle was chambered for a new [[intermediate cartridge]], the [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]], and combined the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a rifle.<ref name=\"Machine Carbine Promoted\" />{{sfn|Rottman|2011|p=9}} On 15 July 1943, an earlier model of the Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the [[People's Commissariat of Arms of the USSR]].<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\" /> The Soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own,<ref name=\"Hallock\" /><ref name=\"Gun Book Review\" /> to replace the [[PPSh-41]] submachine guns and outdated [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] bolt-action rifles that armed most of the Soviet Army.<ref name=\"Field &amp; Stream\" />\n\nThe Soviets soon developed the [[7.62\u00d739mm|7.62\u00d739mm M43 cartridge]],<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\" /> the semi-automatic [[SKS|SKS carbine]] and the [[RPD machine gun|RPD light machine gun]].<ref name=\"virginia1774.org\" /> Shortly after World War II, the Soviets developed the AK-47 assault rifle, which would quickly replace the SKS in Soviet service.<ref name=\"nickpatonwalsh\" /><ref name=\"Rossiyskaya Gazeta\" /> Introduced in 1959, the [[AKM]] is a lighter stamped steel version and the most ubiquitous variant of the entire AK series of firearms. In the 1960s, the Soviets introduced the [[RPK]] light machine gun, an AK type weapon with a stronger receiver, a longer heavy barrel, and a bipod, that would eventually replace the RPD light machine gun.<ref name=\"virginia1774.org\" />\n\n=== Concept ===\n[[File:AK-47 type II Part DM-ST-89-01131.jpg|thumb|A Type 2A AK-47, the first machined receiver variation]]\n\n[[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] began his career as a weapon designer in 1941, while recuperating from a shoulder wound which he received during the [[Battle of Bryansk]].<ref name=\"foxnews\" />{{sfn|Bolotin|1995|pp=123\u2013124}} Kalashnikov himself stated...\"I was in the hospital, and a soldier in the bed beside me asked: 'Why do our soldiers have only one rifle for two or three of our men, when the Germans have automatics?' So I designed one. I was a soldier, and I created a machine gun for a soldier. It was called an Avtomat Kalashnikova, the automatic weapon of Kalashnikov\u2014AK\u2014and it carried the date of its first manufacture, 1947.\"<ref>An interview with Mikhail Kalashnikov, Robert Fisk, The Independent (centrist), London, England. April 22, 2001. http://www.worldpress.org/cover5.htm</ref>\n\nThe AK-47 is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations. \"Kalashnikov decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the American M1 and the German StG44.\"<ref name=\"AP-Kalashnikov\" /> Kalashnikov's team had access to these weapons and had no need to \"reinvent the wheel\". Kalashnikov himself observed: \"A lot of Russian Army soldiers ask me how one can become a constructor, and how new weaponry is designed. These are very difficult questions. Each designer seems to have his own paths, his own successes and failures. But one thing is clear: before attempting to create something new, it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field. I myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so.\"{{sfn|Bolotin|1995|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\nThere are claims about Kalashnikov copying other designs, like Bulkin's TKB-415<ref name=\"Popenker\" /> or Simonov's AVS-31.<ref name=\"Kuptsov\" />\n\n=== Early designs ===\nKalashnikov started work on a submachine gun design in 1942{{sfn|Bolotin|1995|p=123}} and with a light machine gun in 1943.{{sfn|Monetchikov|2005|p=38}}<ref name=\"Bolotin p150\" /> \"Early in 1944, Kalashnikov was given some 7.62\u00d739mm M43 cartridges and informed that there were several designers working on weapons for this new Soviet small-arms cartridge. It was suggested to him that this new weapon might well lead to greater things, and he undertook work on the new rifle.\"<ref name=\"Power Custom\" /> In 1944, he entered a design competition with this new 7.62\u00d739mm, semi-automatic, gas-operated, long stroke piston, carbine, strongly influenced by the American [[M1 Garand]].<ref name=\"The AR-15 2010\" /> \"The rifle that Kalashnikov designed was in the same class as the familiar [[SKS-45]] Simonov with fixed magazine and gas tube above the barrel.\"<ref name=\"Power Custom\" /> However, this new Kalashnikov design lost out to a Simonov design.<ref name=\"Bolotin p115\" />\n\nIn 1946, a new design competition was initiated to develop a new assault rifle.{{sfn|Monetchikov|2005|p=36}} Kalashnikov submitted an entry. It was gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke gas piston above the barrel, a breech-block mechanism similar to his 1944 carbine, and a curved 30-round magazine.<ref name=\"ak-akm-e\" /> Kalashnikov's rifles AK-1 (with a milled [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]]) and AK-2 (with a stamped receiver) proved to be reliable weapons and were accepted to a second round of competition along with other designs.\n\nThese prototypes (also known as the AK-46) had a rotary bolt, a two-part receiver with separate trigger unit housing, dual controls (separate safety and fire selector switches) and a non-reciprocating charging handle located on the left side of the weapon.<ref name=\"ak-akm-e\" /><ref name=\"Popenker-Williams\" /> This design had many similarities to the STG 44.<ref>https://www.forgottenweapons.com/ak-and-stg-kissing-cousins/AK and StG \u2013 Kissing Cousins, December 12, 2012, by Ian McCollum</ref> In late 1946, as the rifles were being tested, one of Kalashnikov's assistants, Aleksandr Zaitsev, suggested a major redesign to improve reliability. At first, Kalashnikov was reluctant, given that their rifle had already fared better than its competitors. Eventually, however, Zaitsev managed to persuade Kalashnikov.\n\n[[File:AK 47.JPG|thumb|1955 AK-47 with a milled Type 3A receiver showing the milled lightening cut on the side above the magazine that for Type 3 receivers is slanted to the barrel axis]]\n\nIn November 1947, the new prototypes (AK-47s) were completed. It utilized a long-stroke gas piston above the barrel. The upper and lower receivers were combined into a single receiver. The selector and safety were combined into a single control-lever/dust-cover on the right side of the rifle. And, the bolt-handle was simply attached to the bolt-carrier. This simplified the design and production of the rifle. The first army trial series began in early 1948.{{sfn|Monetchikov|2005|p=64}} The new rifle proved to be reliable under a wide range of conditions with convenient handling characteristics. In 1949, it was adopted by the Soviet Army as \"7.62&nbsp;mm Kalashnikov assault rifle (AK)\".{{sfnm|Monetchikov|2005|1p=67|Bolotin|1995|2p=129}}\n\n=== Further development ===\n[[File:AKMS and AK-47 DD-ST-85-01270.jpg|thumb|AKMS with a stamped Type 4B receiver (top), and an AK-47 with a milled Type 2A receiver]]\n\nThere were many difficulties during the initial phase of production. The first production models had stamped sheet metal [[receiver (firearms)|receivers]] with a milled trunnion and butt stock insert, and a stamped body. Difficulties were encountered in welding the guide and ejector rails, causing high rejection rates.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|pp=8\u201311}} Instead of halting production, a heavy<ref group=N>2.6 lb milled from 6 lb stock. This was about 2.2 lb heavier than the stamped receiver.</ref> machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver. Even though production of these milled rifles started in 1951, they were officially referred to as AK-49, based on the date their development started, but they are much widely known in the collectors' and current commercial market as \"Type 2 AK-47\".<ref name=\"e36\" /><ref name=\"ForgottenWeapons.com\" /> This was a more costly process, but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] rifle's machined receiver were easily adapted.<ref name=\"browningmgs.com\" /> Partly because of these problems, the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956. During this time, production of the interim [[SKS]] rifle continued.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|pp=8\u201311}}\n\nOnce the manufacturing difficulties of non milled receivers had been overcome, a redesigned version designated the [[AKM]] (M for \"modernized\" or \"upgraded\"; in Russian: ''\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 [Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovanniy])'' was introduced in 1959.<ref name=\"e36\" /> This new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted [[muzzle brake]] on the end of the [[gun barrel|barrel]] to compensate for [[muzzle rise]] under recoil. In addition, a hammer retarder was added to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery (without the bolt being fully closed), during rapid or fully automatic fire.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|pp=8\u201311}} This is also sometimes referred to as a \"cyclic rate reducer\", or simply \"rate reducer\", as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during fully automatic fire. It was also roughly one-third lighter than the previous model.<ref name=\"e36\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! Receiver type\n! Description<ref name=\"browningmgs.com\" />\n|-\n! Type 1A/B\n| The original [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] receiver for the AK-47 first adopted and produced in 1949. The 1B was modified for an underfolding stock with a large hole  present on each side to accommodate the hardware for the underfolding stock.\n|-\n! Type 2A/B\n| The first [[Milling (machining)|milled]] receiver made from steel forging. It went into production in 1951 and production ended between 1953 and 1954. The Type 2A has a distinctive socketed metal \"boot\" connecting the butt stock to the receiver and the milled lightening cut on the sides runs parallel to the barrel.\n|-\n! Type 3A/B\n| \"Final\" version of the AK milled receiver made from steel bar stock. It went into production between 1953 and 1954. The most ubiquitous example of the milled-receiver AK. The milled lightening cut on the sides is slanted to the barrel axis.\n|-\n! Type 4A/B\n| [[AKM]] receiver stamped from a smooth {{convert|1.0|mm|abbr=on|2}} [[Sheet metal|sheet]] of [[steel]] supported extensively by pins and rivets. It went into production in 1959. Overall, the most-used design in the construction of the AK-series rifles.\n|}\n\nBoth licensed and unlicensed production of the Kalashnikov weapons abroad were almost exclusively of the AKM variant, partially due to the much easier production of the stamped receiver. This model is the most commonly encountered, having been produced in much greater quantities. All rifles based on the Kalashnikov design are frequently referred to as AK-47s in the West, although this is only correct when applied to rifles based on the original three receiver types.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|p=2}} In most former Eastern Bloc countries, the weapon is known simply as the \"Kalashnikov\" or \"AK\". The differences between the milled and stamped receivers includes the use of rivets rather than welds on the stamped receiver, as well as the placement of a small dimple above the magazine well for stabilization of the magazine.\n\n=== Replacement ===\nIn 1974, the Soviets began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design, the [[AK-74]], which uses [[5.45\u00d739mm]] ammunition. This new rifle and cartridge had only started to be manufactured in Eastern European nations when the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]], drastically slowing production of the AK-74 and other weapons of the former Soviet bloc.\n\n== Design ==\nThe AK-47 was designed to be a simple, reliable fully automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, using mass production methods that were state of the art in the Soviet Union during the late 1940s.<ref name=\"Dunnigan\" /> The AK-47 uses a [[Gas-operated reloading#Long-stroke piston|long stroke gas system]] that is generally associated with great reliability in adverse conditions.<ref name=\"The AR-15 2010\" /><ref name=\"Tilstra\" /><ref name=\"Dockery\" /> The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle.\n\n=== Cartridge ===\n{{Main|7.62\u00d739mm}}\n[[File:RussianWP.jpg|thumb|Wound Profiles of Russian small-arms ammunition compiled by Dr. [[Martin Fackler]] on behalf of the U.S. military]]\n\nThe AK fires the 7.62\u00d739mm [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]] with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|715|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"izhmash\" />\nThe cartridge weight is {{convert|16.3|g|oz|abbr=on|1}}, the projectile weight is {{convert|7.9|g|gr|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name=\"ammoweight\" /> The original Soviet M43 bullets are 123 grain [[boat-tail bullet]]s with a copper-plated steel jacket, a large steel core, and some lead between the core and the jacket. The AK has excellent penetration when shooting through heavy foliage, walls or a common vehicle's metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover. The 7.62\u00d739mm M43 projectile does not generally fragment when striking an opponent and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone. The 7.62\u00d739mm round produces significant wounding in cases where the bullet tumbles (yaws) in tissue,<ref name=\"Bellamy p146-155\" /> but produces relatively minor wounds in cases where the bullet exits before beginning to yaw.<ref name=\"autogenerated7\" /><ref name=\"Roberts-2008\" /><ref name=\"Purdy\" /> In the absence of yaw, the M43 round can pencil through tissue with relatively little injury.<ref name=\"autogenerated7\" /><ref name=\"Bellamy p148\" />\n\nMost, if not all, of the 7.62\u00d739mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded M67 variety. This variety deleted the steel insert, shifting the center of gravity rearward, and allowing the projectile to destabilize (or yaw) at about {{convert|3.3|in|cm|abbr=on}}, nearly {{convert|6.7|in|cm|abbr=on}} earlier in tissue than the M43 round.<ref name=\"uthr.org\" /> This change also reduces penetration in ballistic gelatin to ~{{convert|25|in|cm|abbr=on}} for the newer M67 round versus ~{{convert|29|in|cm|abbr=on}} for the older M43 round.<ref name=\"uthr.org\" /><ref name=\"Fackler\" /> However, the wounding potential of M67 is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes, especially when the bullet yaws.<ref name=\"uthr.org\" />\n\n=== Operating mechanism ===\n[[File:Chinese type 56 AK47.jpg|thumb|The gas-operated mechanism of a [[Type 56 assault rifle|Chinese AK-47]]]]\n\nTo fire, the operator inserts a loaded [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]], pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]]. In semi-automatic, the firearm fires only once, requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot. In fully automatic, the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle. The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and [[Bolt (firearm)|bolt]] carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier, along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide, rotates the bolt approximately 35\u00b0 and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. The moving assembly has about {{convert|5.5|mm|abbr=on|1}} of free travel, which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence, allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken. The AK-47 does not have a gas valve; excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder. The Kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation, but uses an extractor claw to eject the spent cartridge case.<ref name=\"army\" />\n\n=== Barrel ===\n[[File:Ak-47-iraqis.jpg|thumb|AK-47 barrel and its distinctive gas block with a horizontal row of gas relief ports]]\n\nThe rifle received a barrel with a [[Chrome plating|chrome-lined]] bore and four right-hand grooves at a 240&nbsp;mm (1 in 9.45 in) rifling twist rate. The gas block contains a gas channel that is installed at a slanted angle in relation to the bore axis. The muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a [[muzzle brake]] or a [[blank-firing adaptor]].\n\n===Gas block===\nThe gas block of the AK-47 features a cleaning rod capture or sling loop. Gas relief ports that alleviate gas pressure are placed horizontally in a row on the gas cylinder.\n\n=== Fire selector ===\n[[File:Viet Cong soldier DD-ST-99-04298.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]] soldier armed with an AK-47, standing beneath the flag of the [[National Liberation Front of South Vietnam]]]]\n\nThe fire selector is a large lever located on the right side of the rifle, it acts as a dust-cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe.<ref name=\"arsenalinc1\" /> It is operated by the shooter's right fore-fingers and has 3 settings: safe (up), full-auto (center), and semi-auto (down).<ref name=\"arsenalinc1\" /> The reason for this is that under stress a soldier will push the selector lever down with considerable force bypassing the full-auto stage and setting the rifle to semi-auto.<ref name=\"arsenalinc1\" /> To set the AK-47 to full-auto requires the deliberate action of centering the selector lever.<ref name=\"arsenalinc1\" /> To operate the fire selector lever, right handed shooters have to briefly remove their right hand from the pistol grip, which is ergonomically sub-optimal. Some AK-type rifles also have a more traditional selector lever on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip.<ref name=\"arsenalinc1\" /> This lever is operated by the shooter's right thumb and has three settings: safe (forward), full-auto (center), and semi-auto (backward).<ref name=\"arsenalinc1\" />\n\n=== Sights ===\n[[File:AK47-rear-sight.jpg|thumb|Rear sight of a Chinese Type 56, featuring {{convert|100|to|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} settings and omission of a battle zero setting]]\n\nThe AK-47 uses a notched rear tangent [[iron sight]] calibrated in {{convert|100|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} increments from {{convert|100|to|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"scribd1\" /> The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. Horizontal adjustment requires a special drift tool and is done by the armory before issue or if the need arises by an armorer after issue. The sight line elements are approximately {{convert|48.5|mm|in|1|abbr=on|lk=on}} over the bore axis. The \"[[point-blank range]]\" battle zero setting \"'''''\u041f'''''\" standing for ''\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044fon'' (constant) on the 7.62\u00d739mm AK-47 rear tangent sight element corresponds to a {{convert|300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} zero.<ref name=\"scribd1\" />{{sfn|Rottman|2011|p=42}} These settings mirror the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] and [[SKS]] rifles, which the AK-47 replaced. For the AK-47 combined with service cartridges, the 300 m battle zero setting limits the [[External ballistics#Bullet drop|apparent \"bullet rise\"]] within approximately {{convert|-5|to|+31|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} relative to the line of sight. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle, according to Russian and former Soviet doctrine) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier. Some AK-type rifles have a front sight with a flip-up luminous dot that is calibrated at {{convert|50|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}, for improved night fighting.<ref name=\"scribd1\" />\n\n=== Furniture ===\nThe AK-47 was originally equipped with a buttstock, handguard and an upper heat guard made from solid wood. With the introduction of the Type 3 receiver the buttstock, lower handguard and upper heatguard were manufactured from [[birch]] [[plywood]] [[laminates]].<ref name=\"browningmgs.com\" /> Such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping better than the conventional one-piece patterns, do not require lengthy maturing, and are cheaper. The wooden furniture was finished with the Russian amber shellac finishing process.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} AKS and AKMS models featured a downward-folding metal butt-stock similar to that of the German [[MP40|MP40 submachine-gun]], for use in the restricted space in the [[BMP development|BMP infantry combat vehicle]], as well as by paratroops. All 100 series AKs use plastic furniture with side-folding stocks.\n\n=== Magazines ===\n\n[[File:Bakelite AK magazines.jpg|thumb|\"Bakelite\" rust-colored steel-reinforced 30-round plastic box 7.62\u00d739mm AK magazines. Three magazines have an \"arrow in triangle\" [[Izhmash]] arsenal mark on the bottom right. The other magazine has a \"star\" [[Tula Arms Plant|Tula]] arsenal mark on the bottom right]]\n\nThe standard magazine capacity is 30 rounds. There are also 10, 20, and 40-round box magazines, as well as 75-round [[drum magazine|drum]] magazines.\n\nThe AK-47's standard 30-round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber. Their heavy steel construction combined with \"feed-lips\" (the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber) machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage. These magazines are so strong that \"Soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers, and even bottle openers\".<ref name=\"Small Arms Defense Journal\" /><ref name=\"magazine video\" /> This contributes to the AK-47 magazine being more reliable, but makes it heavier than U.S. and NATO magazines.\n\nThe early slab-sided steel AK-47 30-round detachable box magazines had {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} sheet-metal bodies and weigh {{convert|0.43|kg|lb|abbr=on}} empty.<ref name=\"Dockery\" /> The later steel AKM 30-round magazines had lighter sheet-metal bodies with prominent reinforcing ribs weighing {{convert|0.33|kg|lb|abbr=on}} empty.<ref name=\"Dockery\" /><ref name=\"scribd2\" /> To further reduce weight, a light weight magazine with an aluminum body with a prominent reinforcing waffle rib pattern weighing {{convert|0.19|kg|lb|abbr=on}} empty was developed for the AKM that proved to be too fragile and the small issued amount of these magazines were quickly withdrawn from service. As a replacement steel-reinforced 30-round plastic 7.62\u00d739mm box magazines were introduced. These [[Rust (color)|rust-colored]] magazines weigh {{convert|0.24|kg|lb|abbr=on}} empty and are often mistakenly identified as being made of [[Bakelite]] (a [[phenolic resin]]), but were actually fabricated from two-parts of AG-S4 molding compound (a [[glass-filled polymer|glass-reinforced]] phenol-formaldehyde binder impregnated composite), assembled using an [[epoxy resin]] adhesive.<ref name=\"Kokalis\" /><ref name=\"AG-S4\" /><ref name=\"Kokalis_49\" /> Noted for their durability, these magazines did however compromise the rifle's camouflage and lacked the small horizontal reinforcing ribs running down both sides of the magazine body near the front that were added on all later plastic magazine generations.<ref name=\"Kokalis_49\" /> A second generation steel-reinforced dark-brown (color shades vary from [[maroon]] to [[Plum (color)|plum]] to near [[black]]) 30-round 7.62\u00d739mm magazine was introduced in the early 1980s, fabricated from [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic. The third generation steel-reinforced 30-round 7.62\u00d739mm magazine is similar to the second generation, but is darker colored and has a matte nonreflective surface finish.

The maximum effective range is approximately 150 meters.<ref name=\"ar15\" /> This launcher can also be used to launch [[tear-gas]] and [[riot control]] grenades.\n\nAll current AKs (100 series) and some older models, have side rails for mounting a variety of scopes and sighting devices, such as the [[PSO-1|PSO-1 Optical Sniper Sight]].<ref name=\"Izhmash ak103\" /> The side rails allow for the removal and remounting of optical accessories without interfering with the zeroing of the optic.

In the West, one fires a group of shots into the target and then simply measures the overall diameter of the group. The Russians, on the other hand, fire a group of shots into the target. They then draw two circles on the target, one for the maximum vertical dispersion of hits and one for the maximum horizontal dispersion of hits. They then disregard the hits on the outer part of the target and only count half of the hits (50% or R<sub>50</sub>) on the inner part of the circles. This dramatically reduces the overall diameter of the groups. They then use both the vertical and horizontal measurements of the reduced groups to measure accuracy. This [[circular error probable]] method used by the Russians and other European militaries cannot be converted and is not comparable to US military methods for determining rifle accuracy. When the R<sub>50</sub> results are doubled the hit probability increases to 93.7%.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!colspan=\"7\"|AK-47 semi-automatic and short burst dispersion with 57-N-231 steel core service ammunition<ref name=\"\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0430\u043b\">Instruction on small business 7,62- mm Kalashnikov (AK). - Moscow: Military Publishing House of the Ministry of Defense of the USSR, 1967.</ref>\n|-\n!Range||Vertical accuracy of fire (R<sub>50</sub>) semi-automatic||Horizontal accuracy of fire (R<sub>50</sub>) semi-automatic||Vertical accuracy of fire (R<sub>50</sub>) short burst||Horizontal accuracy of fire (R<sub>50</sub>) short burst||Remaining bullet energy||Remaining bullet velocity\n|-\n|{{convert|0|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|2036|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|718|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|100|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|11|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|1540|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|624|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|200|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|11|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|18|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|22|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|1147|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|539|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|17|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|27|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|33|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|843|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|462|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|400|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|23|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|16|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|31|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|44|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|618|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|395|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|29|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|20|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|46|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|56|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|461|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|342|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|600|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|35|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|24|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|56|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|67|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|363|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|303|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|700|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|42|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|29|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|66|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|78|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|314|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|282|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|{{convert|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|49|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|34|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|76|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|89|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|284|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|268|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n|}\n* <small>R<sub>50</sub> means the closest 50 percent of the shot group will all be within a circle of the mentioned diameter.</small>\n\nThe vertical and horizontal mean (R<sub>50</sub>) deviations with service ammunition at {{convert|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} for AK platforms are.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!colspan=\"4\"|SKS, AK-47, AKM, and AK-74 dispersion at {{convert|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n!Rifle||Firing mode||Vertical accuracy of fire (R<sub>50</sub>)||Horizontal accuracy of fire (R<sub>50</sub>)\n|-\n|[[SKS]] <small>(1945)</small>||semi-automatic||{{convert|38|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|29|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|AK-47 <small>(1949)</small>||semi-automatic||{{convert|49|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|34|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|AK-47 <small>(1949)</small>||short burst||{{convert|76|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|89|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|[[AKM]] <small>(1959)</small>||short burst||{{convert|64|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|90|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|[[AK-74]] <small>(1974)</small>||short burst||{{convert|48|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|64|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|}\n\n== Users ==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

During this time the Western countries used relatively expensive automatic rifles, such as the [[FN FAL]], the [[Heckler & Koch G3|HK G3]], the [[M14 rifle|M14]], and the [[M16 rifle|M16]]. In contrast, the Russians and Chinese used the AK-47; its low production cost and ease of manufacture allow them to make AKs in vast numbers.\n\nIn the pro-communist states, the AK-47 became a symbol of the [[Third World]] revolution.

For example, Western movies often portray criminals, gang members and terrorists using AK-47s. For these reasons, in the U.S. and Western Europe, the AK-47 is stereotypically regarded as the weapon of choice of insurgents, gangsters and terrorists. Conversely, throughout the [[developing world]], the AK-47 can be positively attributed with [[revolutionaries]] against foreign occupation, [[imperialism]], or [[colonialism]].<ref name=\"NPRKahaner\" />\n\nThe AK-47 made an appearance in U.S. popular culture as a recurring focus in the [[Nicolas Cage]] film ''[[Lord of War]]'' (2005). Numerous monologues in the movie focus on the weapon, and its effects on global conflict and the [[gun running]] market.<ref name=\"Lord of War\" />\n\nIn 2006, the Colombian musician and peace activist [[Cesar Lopez|C\u00e9sar L\u00f3pez]] devised the ''[[escopetarra]]'', an AK converted into a guitar.

The ABC innovations included electronic computation, binary arithmetic, [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]], [[regenerative capacitor memory]], and a separation of memory and computing functions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/computer-hist-web.htm|title=The History of Computing|author=|date=|website=mason.gmu.edu|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>  The mechanical and logic design was worked out by Atanasoff over the next year.

A January 15, 1941 story in the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' announced the ABC as \"an electrical computing machine\" with more than 300 vacuum tubes that would \"compute complicated algebraic equations\" (but gave no precise technical description of the computer). The system weighed more than {{convert|700|lb|kg|spell=in}}. It contained approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} of wire, 280 dual-triode [[vacuum tube]]s, 31 [[thyratron]]s, and was about the size of a desk.\n\nIt was not a [[Turing complete]] computer, which distinguishes it from more general machines, like contemporary  [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] (1941), or later machines like the 1946 [[ENIAC]], the 1949 [[EDVAC]], the [[Manchester computers|University of Manchester]] designs, or [[Alan Turing]]'s post-War design of [[Automatic Computing Engine|ACE]] at [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|NPL]] and elsewhere. Nor did it implement the [[stored program architecture]] that made practical fully general-purpose, reprogrammable computers.\n\n[[File:Atanasoff-Berry add-subtract module.agr.jpg|thumb|Add-subtract module (reconstructed) from Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer]]\nThe machine was, however, the first to implement three critical ideas that are still part of every modern computer:\n#Using [[binary numeral system|binary]] digits to represent all numbers and data\n#Performing all calculations using [[electronics]] rather than wheels, ratchets, or mechanical switches\n#Organizing a system in which [[computation]] and [[computer storage|memory]] are separated.\n\nThe memory of the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer was a system called ''regenerative capacitor memory'', which consisted of a pair of drums, each containing 1600 [[capacitor]]s that rotated on a common shaft once per second. The capacitors on each drum were organized into 32 \"bands\" of 50 (30 active bands and two spares in case a capacitor failed), giving the machine a speed of 30 additions/subtractions per second. Data was represented as 50-bit binary [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] numbers. The electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on 60 such numbers at a time (3000 bits).\n\nThe [[alternating current]] [[utility frequency|power line frequency]] of 60&nbsp;Hz was the primary clock rate for the lowest-level operations.\n\nThe [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic logic functions]] were fully electronic, implemented with vacuum tubes. The family of [[logic gate]]s ranged from inverters to two and three input gates. The input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates. Each gate consisted of one inverting vacuum tube amplifier, preceded by a resistor divider input network that defined the logical function. The control logic functions, which only needed to operate once per drum rotation and therefore did not require electronic speed, were electromechanical, implemented with [[relay]]s.\n\nAlthough the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer was an important step up from earlier calculating machines, it was not able to run entirely automatically through an entire problem. An operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions, much like the electro-mechanical calculators and [[unit record equipment]] of the time. Selection of the operation to be performed, reading, writing, converting to or from binary to decimal, or reducing a set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers.\n\nThere were two forms of input and output: primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input. The intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory. (The largest problem that could be solved without the use of the intermediate output and input was two [[simultaneous equations]], a trivial problem.)\n\nIntermediate results were binary, written onto paper sheets by electrostatically modifying the resistance at 1500 locations to represent 30 of the 50-bit numbers (one equation). Each sheet could be written or read in one second. The reliability of the system was limited to about 1 error in 100,000 calculations by these units, primarily attributed to lack of control of the sheets' material characteristics. In retrospect a solution could have been to add a parity bit to each number as written. This problem was not solved by the time Atanasoff left the university for war-related work.\n\nPrimary user input was decimal, via standard [[IBM]] 80-column [[punched card]]s and output was decimal, via a front panel display.\n\n==Function==\nThe ABC was designed for a specific purpose, the solution of systems of simultaneous linear equations. It could handle systems with up to twenty-nine equations, a difficult problem for the time. Problems of this scale were becoming common in physics, the department in which John Atanasoff worked. The machine could be fed two linear equations with up to twenty-nine variables and a constant term and eliminate one of the variables. This process would be repeated manually for each of the equations, which would result in a system of equations with one fewer variable. Then the whole process would be repeated to eliminate another variable.\n\n[[George W. Snedecor]], the head of Iowa State's Statistics Department, was very likely the first user of an electronic digital computer to solve real-world mathematics problems. He submitted many of these problems to Atanasoff.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ra\u00fal |last=Rojas |title=The First Computers: History and Architectures |location= |publisher=MIT Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-262-68137-4 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nDWPW9uwZPAC }}</ref>\n\n==Patent dispute==\nOn June 26, 1947, J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly were the first to file for patent on a digital computing device (ENIAC), much to the surprise of Atanasoff.

The [[United States District Court for the District of Minnesota]] released its judgement on October 19, 1973, finding in ''[[Honeywell v. Sperry Rand]]'' that the ENIAC patent was a derivative of John Atanasoff's invention.\n\nCampbell-Kelly and Aspray conclude:\n{{Quote|The extent to which Mauchly drew on Atanasoff's ideas remains unknown, and the evidence is massive and conflicting. The ABC was quite modest technology, and it was not fully implemented. At the very least we can infer that Mauchly saw the potential significance of the ABC and that this may have led him to propose a similar, electronic solution.{{sfn|Campbell-Kelly|Aspray|1996|p=86}}}}\n\nThe case was legally resolved on October 19, 1973 when U.S. District Judge Earl R. Larson held the ENIAC patent invalid, ruling that the ENIAC derived many basic ideas from the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer. Judge Larson explicitly stated,\n{{Quote|Eckert and Mauchly did not themselves first invent the automatic electronic digital computer, but instead derived that subject matter from one Dr. John Vincent Atanasoff.}}\n\n[[Herman Goldstine]], one of the original developers of ENIAC wrote:\n\n{{Quote|Atanasoff contemplated storing the coefficients of an equation in capacitors located on the periphery of a cylinder. He apparently had a prototype of his machine working 'early in 1940'. This machine was, it should be emphasized, probably the first use of vacuum tubes to do digital computation and was a special-purpose machine.\n\nThis machine never saw the light of day as a serious tool for computation since it was somewhat premature in its engineering conception and limited in its logical one. Nonetheless it must be viewed as a great pioneering effort. Perhaps its chief importance was to influence the thinking of another physicist who was much interested in the computational process, John W. Mauchly. During the period of Atanasoff's work on his linear equation solver, Mauchly was at Ursinus College, a small school in the environs of Philadelphia. Somehow he became aware of Atanasoff's project and visited him for a week in 1941. During the visit the two men apparently went into Atanasoff's ideas in considerable detail. The discussion greatly influenced Mauchly and through him the entire history of electronic computers.<ref>Herman Goldstine, 'The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann', 1972; pp.125-126</ref>}}\n\n==Replica==\nThe original ABC was eventually dismantled in 1948,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Soltis|first1=Frank G.|title=Fortress Rochester: The Inside Story of the IBM ISeries|date=2001|publisher=System iNetwork|isbn=9781583040836|page=364|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypJmzqt7JdUC|language=en}}</ref> when the University converted the basement to classrooms, and all of its pieces except for one memory drum were discarded.\n\nIn 1997, a team of researchers led by [[John Gustafson (scientist)|John Gustafson]] from [[Ames Laboratory]] (located on the Iowa State campus) finished building a working replica of the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer at a cost of $350,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.35|1997|r=2}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}).

This range is about {{convert|7000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, about {{convert|200|to|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide (widest between [[18th parallel south|18\u00b0 south]] and [[20th parallel south|20\u00b0 south]] [[latitude]]), and of an average height of about {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].\n\nAlong their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, separated by intermediate [[depression (geology)|depression]]s. The Andes are the location of several high [[plateau]]s \u2013 some of which host major cities such as [[Quito]], [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Arequipa]], [[Medell\u00edn]], [[Sucre]], [[M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida]] and [[La Paz]]. The [[Altiplano|Altiplano plateau]] is the world's second-highest after the [[Tibetan plateau]]. These ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate: the [[Tropical Andes]], the [[Dry Andes]], and the [[Wet Andes]].\n\nThe Andes are the world's highest mountain range outside [[Asia]]. The highest mountain outside Asia, Argentina's Mount [[Aconcagua]], rises to an elevation of about {{convert|6961|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The [[Summit (topography)|peak]] of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] in the Ecuadorian Andes is farther from the Earth's center than any other location on the Earth's surface, due to the [[equatorial bulge]] resulting from the [[Earth's rotation]].

The Andes are the result of [[plate tectonics]] processes, caused by the [[subduction]] of [[oceanic crust]] beneath the [[South American Plate]].It is the result of a convergent plate boundary between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate The main cause of the rise of the Andes is the compression of the western rim of the [[South American Plate]] due to the subduction of the [[Nazca Plate]] and the [[Antarctic Plate]]. To the east, the Andes range is bounded by several [[sedimentary basin]]s, such as [[Orinoco]], [[Amazon Basin]], [[Madre de Dios River|Madre de Dios]] and [[Gran Chaco]], that separate the Andes from the ancient [[craton]]s in eastern South America. In the south, the Andes share a long boundary with the former [[Patagonia#Geology|Patagonia Terrane]]. To the west, the Andes end at the [[Pacific Ocean]], although the [[Peru-Chile trench]] can be considered their ultimate western limit. From a geographical approach, the Andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and a less rugged topography. The Andes Mountains also contain large quantities of iron ore located in many mountains within the range.\n\nThe Andean orogen has a series of bends or [[orocline]]s.

The development continued through the [[Jurassic]] Period. It was during the [[Cretaceous]] Period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifting]], [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] rocks of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant, as different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and [[erosion]].\n\nTectonic forces above the [[subduction zone]] along the entire west coast of South America where the [[Nazca Plate]] and a part of the [[Antarctic Plate]] are sliding beneath the [[South American Plate]] continue to produce an ongoing [[Orogeny|orogenic event]] resulting in minor to major [[earthquake]]s and [[volcanic eruption]]s to this day. In the extreme south, a major [[transform fault]] separates [[Tierra del Fuego]] from the small [[Scotia Plate]]. Across the {{convert|1000|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} wide [[Drake Passage]] lie the mountains of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] south of the Scotia Plate which appear to be a continuation of the Andes chain. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nThe regions immediately east of the Andes experience a series of changes resulting from the Andean orogeny.

The Andean volcanism is a result of [[subduction]] of the Nazca Plate and Antarctic Plate underneath the South American Plate. The belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones that are separated from each other by volcanic gaps. The volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style, products and morphology. While some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to, there are significant differences inside volcanic zones and even between neighbouring volcanoes. Despite being a type location for [[calc-alkalic]] and subduction volcanism, the Andean Volcanic Belt has a large range of volcano-tectonic settings, such as rift systems and extensional zones, transpressional faults, subduction of [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and [[seamount]] chains apart from a large range of crustal thicknesses and [[magma]] ascent paths, and different amount of crustal assimilations.\n\n===Ore deposits and evaporates===\nThe Andes Mountains host large [[ore]] and [[salt]] deposits and some of their eastern [[fold and thrust belt]] acts as traps for commercially exploitable amounts of [[hydrocarbon]]s. In the forelands of the [[Atacama desert]] some of the largest [[porphyry copper]] mineralizations occurs making Chile and Peru the first and second largest exporters of [[copper]] in the world. Porphyry copper in the western slopes of the Andes has been generated by [[hydrothermal fluid]]s (mostly water) during the cooling of [[pluton (geology)|pluton]]s or volcanic systems. The porphyry mineralization further benefited from the dry climate that let them largely out of the disturbing actions of [[meteoric water]]. The dry climate in the central western Andes has also led to the creation of extensive [[Chile saltpeter|saltpeter deposits]] which were extensively mined until the invention of synthetic nitrates. Yet another result of the dry climate are the [[Dry lake|salars]] of [[Salar de Atacama|Atacama]] and [[Salar de Uyuni|Uyuni]], the first one being the largest source of [[lithium]] today and the second the world's largest reserve of the element. Early Mesozoic and [[Neogene]] plutonism in Bolivia's Cordillera Central created the Bolivian [[tin]] belt as well as the famous, now depleted, deposits of [[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potos\u00ed]].\n\n==Climate and hydrology==\n{{See also|Tropical Andes|Dry Andes|Wet Andes}}\n[[File:Andes1a.JPG|thumb|Central Andes]]\n[[File:Andes bolivianos.jpg|thumb|Bolivian Andes]]\n\nThe climate in the Andes varies greatly depending on latitude, altitude, and proximity to the sea. Temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity decrease in higher elevations. The southern section is rainy and cool, the central section is dry. The northern Andes are typically rainy and warm, with an average temperature of {{convert|18|C|F|0}} in Colombia. The climate is known to change drastically in rather short distances. [[Rainforest]]s exist just miles away from the snow-covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The [[snow line]] depends on the location. It is at between {{convert|4,500|and|4,800|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, rising to {{convert|4,800|-|5,200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30\u00b0S, then descending to {{convert|4500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} on Aconcagua at 32\u00b0S, {{convert|2000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} at 40\u00b0S, {{convert|500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} at 50\u00b0S, and only {{convert|300|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in [[Tierra del Fuego]] at 55\u00b0S; from 50\u00b0S, several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title=Climate of the Andes\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/andes_climate_page.htm\n  | accessdate=2007-12-09 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071214073114/http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/andes_climate_page.htm| archivedate= 14 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nThe Andes of Chile and Argentina can be divided in two climatic and glaciological zones: the [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]]. Since the Dry Andes extend from the latitudes of [[Atacama Desert]] to the area of [[Maule River]], precipitation is more sporadic and there are strong temperature oscillations. The line of equilibrium may shift drastically over short periods of time, leaving a whole glacier in the [[ablation]] area or in the [[Glacier ice accumulation|accumulation area]].\n\nIn the high Andes of central Chile and [[Mendoza Province]], [[rock glacier]]s are larger and more common than glaciers; this is due to the high exposure to [[solar radiation]].<ref>Jan-Christoph Otto, Joachim G\u00f6tz, Markus Keuschnig, Ingo Hartmeyer, Dario Trombotto, and Lothar Schrott (2010).

This dry steppe climate is considered to be typical of the subtropical position at 32\u201334\u00b0 S. The valley bottoms have no woods, just dwarf scrub. The largest glaciers, as e.g. the Plomo glacier and the Horcones glaciers, do not even reach 10&nbsp;km in length and have an only insignificant ice thickness.

A long series of cultural development culminated in the expansion of the [[Inca civilization]] and [[Inca Empire]] in the central Andes during the 15th century. The Incas formed this civilization through [[imperialist]]ic [[militarism]] as well as careful and meticulous governmental management.<ref>D'Altroy, Terence N. The Incas. Blackwell Publishing, 2003</ref> The government sponsored the construction of [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] and [[roads]] in addition to preexisting installations. Some of these constructions are still in existence today.\n\nDevastated by European diseases to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] and civil wars, in 1532 the Incas were defeated by an alliance composed of tens of thousands of allies from nations they had subjugated (e.g. [[Huancas]], [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s) and a small army of 180 Spaniards led by [[Francisco Pizarro]]. One of the few Inca sites the Spanish never found in their conquest was [[Machu Picchu]], which lay hidden on a peak on the eastern edge of the Andes where they descend to the Amazon. The main surviving languages of the Andean peoples are those of the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language]] families. [[Woodbine Parish]] and [[Joseph Barclay Pentland]] surveyed a large part of the Bolivian Andes from 1826 to 1827.\n\n===Cities===\n[[File:La Paz Skyline.jpg|thumb|La Paz, Bolivia is the highest capital city in the world]]\n[[File:Santiago depois da chuva (11).JPG|thumb|[[Santiago de Chile]]]]\nIn modern times, the largest cities in the Andes are [[Bogot\u00e1, Colombia]], with a population of about eight million, [[Santiago, Chile]], and [[Medellin, Colombia]]. [[Lima]] is a coastal city adjacent to the Andes and is the largest city of all Andean countries. It is the seat of the [[Andean Community of Nations]]. \n\n[[La Paz]], [[Bolivia|Bolivia's]] seat of government, is the highest capital city in the world, at an elevation of approximately {{convert|3650|m|0|abbr=on}}. Parts of the La Paz conurbation, including the city of [[El Alto]], extend up to {{convert|4200|m|0|abbr=on}}.   \n\nOther cities in or near the Andes include [[Arequipa]], [[Cusco]], [[Huancayo]], [[Cajamarca]], [[Juliaca]], [[Hu\u00e1nuco]], [[Huaraz]], and [[Puno]] in Peru; [[Quito]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]], [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]], [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]], [[Riobamba]], and [[Ibarra, Ecuador|Ibarra]] in  Ecuador; [[Cochabamba]], [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], [[Sucre]], and [[Tarija]] in Bolivia; [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n|Tucum\u00e1n]],  [[Salta, Argentina|Salta]], and [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]] in Argentina; [[Calama, Chile|Calama]] and [[Rancagua]] in Chile; [[Cali]], [[C\u00facuta]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Ibagu\u00e9]], [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]], [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]], [[Palmira, Valle del Cauca|Palmira]], [[Popay\u00e1n]], [[Tunja]], [[Villavicencio]], and [[Manizales]]  in Colombia; and [[Barquisimeto]], [[San Crist\u00f3bal, T\u00e1chira|San Crist\u00f3bal]], [[M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida]], and [[Valera]] in Venezuela. The cities of [[Caracas]], [[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]], and [[Maracay]] are in the [[Venezuelan Coastal Range]], which is a debatable extension of the Andes at the northern extreme of South America.\n\n===Transportation===\n\nCities and large towns are connected with [[asphalt]]-paved roads, while smaller towns are often connected by dirt roads, which may require a [[four-wheel-drive]] vehicle.<ref name=\"andesmap\">[http://andes.zoom-maps.com/ Andes travel map]</ref>\n\n[[File:Pico Humboldt y su glaciar.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Venezuelan Andes in [[M\u00e9rida (state)|M\u00e9rida]]]]\n\nThe rough terrain has historically put the costs of building [[highway]]s and [[railroad]]s that cross the Andes out of reach of most neighboring countries, even with modern [[civil engineering]] practices. For example, the main crossover of the Andes between Argentina and Chile is still accomplished through the [[Paso Internacional Los Libertadores]]. Only recently the ends of some highways that came rather close to one another from the east and the west have been connected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1159492-jujuy-apuesta-a-captar-las-cargas-de-brasil-en-transito-hacia-chile|title=''Jujuy apuesta a captar las cargas de Brasil en tr\u00e1nsito hacia Chile'' by Emiliano Galli  |publisher=La Naci\u00f3n newspaper|accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref> Much of the transportation of passengers is done via aircraft.\n\nHowever, there is one railroad that connects Chile with Argentina via the Andes, and there are others that make the same connection via southern Bolivia. See railroad maps of that region.\n\nThere are multiple highways in Bolivia that cross the Andes. Some of these were built during a [[Chaco War|period of war]] between Bolivia and [[Paraguay]], in order to transport Bolivian troops and their supplies to the war front in the lowlands of southeastern Bolivia and western Paraguay.\n\nFor decades, Chile claimed ownership of land on the eastern side of the Andes. However, these claims were given up in about 1870 during the [[War of the Pacific]] between Chile, the allied Bolivia and Peru, in a diplomatic deal to keep Argentina out of the war. The [[Chilean Army]] and [[Chilean Navy]] defeated the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru, and Chile took over Bolivia's only province on the Pacific Coast, some land from Peru that was returned to Peru decades later. Bolivia has been a completely [[landlocked]] country ever since. It mostly uses [[seaport]]s in eastern Argentina and [[Uruguay]] for international trade because its diplomatic relations with Chile have been suspended since 1978.\n\nBecause of the tortuous terrain in places, villages and towns in the mountains\u2014to which travel via [[motorized vehicle]]s is of little use\u2014are still located in the high Andes of Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, and [[Ecuador]]. Locally, the relatives of the [[camel]], the [[llama]], and the [[alpaca]] continue to carry out important uses as pack animals, but this use has generally diminished in modern times. [[Donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, and horses are also useful.\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Peruvianterracefarmers.jpg|thumb|Peruvian farmers sowing maize and beans]]\n{{See also|Andean Agriculture|Incan agriculture|Vertical archipelago}}\n\nThe ancient peoples of the Andes such as the Incas have practiced [[irrigation]] techniques for over 6,000 years. Because of the mountain slopes, [[And\u00e9n|terracing]] has been a common practice. Terracing, however, was only extensively employed after Incan imperial expansions to fuel their expanding realm. The [[potato]] holds a very important role as an internally consumed staple crop. [[Maize]] was also an important crop for these people, and was used for the production of [[chicha]], important to Andean native people. Currently, [[tobacco]], [[cotton]] and [[coffee]] are the main export crops. [[Coca]], despite eradication programmes in some countries, remains an important crop for legal local use in a mildly stimulating [[herbal tea]], and, both controversially and illegally, for the production of [[cocaine]].\n\n===Irrigation===\n[[File:Women_irrigators_in_the_Andes.jpg|thumb|left|Irrigating land in the Peruvian Andes]]\n\nIn unirrigated land, [[pasture]] is the most common type of land use. In the rainy season (summer), part of the rangeland is used for cropping (mainly potatoes, barley, broad beans and wheat).\n\nIrrigation is helpful in advancing the sowing data of the summer crops which guarantees an early yield in the period of food shortage. Also, by early sowing, maize can be cultivated higher up in the mountains (till 3800 m). In addition it makes cropping in the dry season (winter) possible and allows the cultivation of frost resistant vegetable crops like [[onion]] and [[carrot]].<ref>W. van Immerzeel, 1989.

Published in Annual Report 1989, p. 8 \u2013 24, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen, The Netherlands. On line: [https://www.waterlog.info/pdf/andes.pdf]</ref>\n\n===Mining===\nThe Andes rose to fame for their mineral wealth during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest of South America]]. Although Andean Amerindian peoples crafted ceremonial jewelry of gold and other metals, the [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralization]]s of the Andes were first mined in large scale after the Spanish arrival. [[Potos\u00ed]] in present-day [[Bolivia]] and [[Cerro de Pasco]] in Peru were one of the principal mines of the Spanish Empire in the New World. [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] and [[Argentina]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.argentine-embassy-uk.org/docs_eng/links/links_information_argentina.shtml|title=Information on Argentina|last=|first=|date=|website=Argentine Embassy London|access-date=}}</ref> derive their names from the silver of Potos\u00ed.\n\nCurrently, mining in the Andes of [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] places these countries as the first and third major producers of [[copper]] in the world. [[Peru]] also contains the 4th largest goldmine in the world: the [[Yanacocha]]. The Bolivian Andes produce principally [[tin]] although historically silver mining had a huge impact on the [[Price revolution|economy]] of 17th century Europe.\n\nThere is a long history of mining in the Andes, from the Spanish [[silver]] [[Mining|mine]]s in [[Potos\u00ed]] in the 16th century to the vast current [[porphyry copper deposit]]s of [[Chuquicamata]] and [[Escondida]] in Chile and [[Toquepala mine|Toquepala]] in Peru. Other metals including iron, gold and tin in addition to non-metallic resources are important.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Huasos Maulinos - Rugendas.jpg|Chilean [[huaso]]s, 19th century\nFile:Macchupicchu.jpg|The mountain [[Huayna Picchu]] overlooks the [[Inca]] [[estate (land)]] of [[Machu Picchu]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Peaks==\n{{Main|List of mountains in the Andes}}\nThis list contains some of the major peaks in the Andes mountain range.

The word derives from [[Latin]] ''ancora'', which itself comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u1f04\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 (''ankura'').<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/anchor anchor], Oxford Dictionaries</ref><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Fgkura \u1f04\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>\n\nAnchors can either be temporary or permanent. Permanent anchors are used in the creation of a [[mooring (watercraft)#Permanent anchor mooring|mooring]], and are rarely moved; a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain them. Vessels carry one or more temporary anchors, which may be of different designs and weights.\n\nA [[sea anchor]] is a [[drogue]], not in contact with the seabed, used to control a drifting vessel.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Stockless anchor 2 NT.PNG|thumb|right|A stockless anchor being broken out]]\n\nAnchors achieve holding power either by \"hooking\" into the [[seabed]], via sheer mass, or a combination of the two. Permanent moorings use large masses (commonly a block or slab of concrete) resting on the seabed. Semi-permanent mooring anchors (such as [[#Mushroom anchor|mushroom anchor]]s) and large ship's anchors derive a significant portion of their holding power from their mass, while also hooking or embedding in the bottom. Modern anchors for smaller vessels have metal ''flukes'' which hook on to rocks on the bottom or bury themselves in soft seabed.\n\nThe vessel is attached to the anchor by the ''rode'' (commonly called the ''anchor cable'' or ''anchor chain'' in larger vessels), which is made of [[chain]], [[Wire rope|cable]], [[rope]], or a combination of these. The ratio of the length of rode to the water depth is known as the scope; generally, the rode should be between 5 and 10 times the depth of the seabed, giving a scope of 5:1 or 10:1; the larger the number, the shallower the angle is between the cable and the seafloor, and the less upwards force is acting on the anchor. A 10:1 scope gives the greatest holding power, but also allows for much more drifting due to the longer amount of cable paid out. Anchoring with sufficient scope and/or heavy chain rode brings the direction of strain close to parallel with the seabed. This is particularly important for light, modern anchors designed to bury in the bottom, where scopes of 5- to 7-to-1 are common, whereas heavy anchors and moorings can use a scope of 3-to-1, or less.\n\nSince all anchors that embed themselves in the bottom require the strain to be along the seabed, anchors can be broken out of the bottom by shortening the rope until the vessel is directly above the anchor; at this point the anchor chain is \"up and down\", in naval parlance. If necessary, motoring slowly around the location of the anchor also helps dislodge it. Anchors are sometimes fitted with a [[tripping line]] attached to the crown, by which they can be unhooked from rocks or coral.\n\nThe term ''aweigh'' describes an anchor when it is hanging on the rope and is not resting on the bottom. This is linked to the term ''to weigh anchor'', meaning to lift the anchor from the sea bed, allowing the ship or boat to move. An anchor is described as ''aweigh'' when it has been broken out of the bottom and is being hauled up to be ''stowed''. ''Aweigh'' should not be confused with ''under way'', which describes a vessel which is not ''moored'' to a dock or ''anchored'', whether or not the vessel is moving through the water.\n\n== Evolution of the anchor ==\n{{Main|History of the anchor}}\n[[File:Anchor types.jpg|thumb|upright=2|left|Diagram of various types of anchors, including Danforth, Hall, AC14, Spek, Kedge-Admiralty, Buyers, Union, Pool, Stockless, KLIP, ZY-6, D'Hone, Bruce, FOB, and Navy Stockless]]\nThe earliest anchors were probably rocks, and many rock anchors have been found dating from at least the [[Bronze Age]].<ref>Johnstone, Paul and McGrail, Se\u00e1n (1989). ''The sea-craft of prehistory.'' London: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-02635-2}}, p.82.</ref> Pre-European Maori waka (canoes) used one or more hollowed stones, tied with flax ropes, as anchors. Many modern moorings still rely on a large rock as the primary element of their design.  However, using pure mass to resist the forces of a storm only works well as a permanent mooring; a large enough rock would be nearly impossible to move to a new location.\n\nThe ancient Greeks used baskets of stones, large sacks filled with sand, and wooden logs filled with lead. According to [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius Rhodius]] and [[Stephanus of Byzantium|Stephen of Byzantium]], anchors were formed of stone, and Athenaeus states that they were also sometimes made of wood. Such anchors held the vessel merely by their weight and by their friction along the bottom. Iron was afterwards introduced for the construction of anchors, and an improvement was made by forming them with teeth, or \"flukes\", to fasten themselves into the bottom.\n\n=== Admiralty Pattern ===\n[[Image:Admiralty anchor.JPG|thumb|An Admiralty Pattern anchor; ideally, when this anchor rests on the seafloor, it is turned 90 degrees from the position shown here, so the sharp point of one fluke is dug into the bottom, the other is pointing straight up, and the arms are lying level on the seafloor]]\nThe Admiralty Pattern, \"A.P.\", or simply \"Admiralty\", and also known as \"Fisherman\", is the anchor shape most familiar to non-sailors. It consists of a central shank with a ring or [[shackle]] for attaching the rode. At the other end of the shank there are two arms, carrying the flukes, while the stock is mounted to the shackle end, at ninety degrees to the arms. When the anchor lands on the bottom, it will generally fall over with the arms parallel to the seabed. As a strain comes onto the rode, the stock will dig into the bottom, canting the anchor until one of the flukes catches and digs into the bottom.\n\nThis basic design remained unchanged for centuries, with the most significant changes being to the overall proportions, and a move from stocks made of wood to iron stocks in the late 1830s and early 1840s. Since one fluke always protrudes up from the set anchor, there is a great tendency of the rode to foul the anchor as the vessel swings due to wind or current shifts. When this happens, the anchor may be pulled out of the bottom, and in some cases may need to be hauled up to be re-set. In the mid-19th century, numerous modifications were attempted to alleviate these problems, as well as improve holding power, including one-armed mooring anchors. The most successful of these ''patent anchors'', the Trotman Anchor, introduced a pivot where the arms join the shank, allowing the \"idle\" arm to fold against the shank.\n\nHandling and storage of these anchors requires special equipment and procedures. Once the anchor is hauled up to the [[hawsepipe]], the ring end is hoisted up to the end of a timber projecting from the bow known as the [[cathead]]. The crown of the anchor is then hauled up with a heavy tackle until one fluke can be hooked over the rail. This is known as \"catting and fishing\" the anchor. Before dropping the anchor, the fishing process is reversed, and the anchor is dropped from the end of the cathead.\n\n===Stockless anchor===\n{{main|Stockless anchor}}\n[[File:Anchor, England - scan01.jpg|thumb|right|Stockless anchor]]\nThe stockless anchor, patented in England in 1821,<ref name=Brit>\"anchor\" in ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''. Chicago: [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.]], 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, pp. 377\u20138.</ref> represented the first significant departure in anchor design in centuries. Though their holding-power-to-weight ratio is significantly lower than admiralty pattern anchors, their ease of handling and stowage aboard large ships led to almost universal adoption. In contrast to the elaborate stowage procedures for earlier anchors, stockless anchors are simply hauled up until they rest with the shank inside the hawsepipes, and the flukes against the hull (or inside a recess in the hull).\n\nWhile there are numerous variations, stockless anchors consist of a set of heavy flukes connected by a pivot or ball and socket joint to a shank. Cast into the crown of the anchor is a set of tripping palms, projections that drag on the bottom, forcing the main flukes to dig in.\n\n[[File:Stockless anchor 1 NT.PNG|thumb|left|The action of a stockless anchor being set]]\n\n== Small boat anchors ==\nUntil the mid-20th century, anchors for smaller vessels were either scaled-down versions of admiralty anchors, or simple [[grapnels]]. As new designs with greater holding-power-to-weight ratios, a great variety of anchor designs has emerged. Many of these designs are still under patent, and other types are best known by their original trademarked names.\n\n===Grapnel anchor===\nA traditional design, the grapnel is merely a shank with four or more tines. It has a benefit in that, no matter how it reaches the bottom, one or more tines will be aimed to set. In coral, or rock, it is often able to set quickly by hooking into the structure, but may be more difficult to retrieve. A grapnel is often quite light, and may have additional uses as a tool to recover gear lost overboard. Its weight also makes it relatively easy to move and carry, however its shape is generally not very compact and it may be awkward to stow unless a collapsing model is used.\n\nGrapnels rarely have enough fluke area to develop much hold in sand, clay, or mud. It is not unknown for the anchor to foul on its own rode, or to foul the tines with refuse from the bottom, preventing it from digging in. On the other hand, it is quite possible for this anchor to find such a good hook that, without a trip line from the crown, it is impossible to retrieve.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grapnel anchor|url=https://aceboater.com/en/grapnel-anchor|website=AceBoater.com|accessdate=18 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How to Choose the Right Boat Anchor Types \u2013 Active Fisherman|url=https://www.activefisherman.com/choose-right-boat-anchor-types.html|website=Active Fisherman|accessdate=18 May 2016|date=2 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Herreshoff anchor ===\nDesigned by famous yacht designer [[Lewis Francis Herreshoff|L. Francis Herreshoff]], this is essentially the same pattern as an admiralty anchor, albeit with small diamond shaped flukes or palms. The novelty of the design lay in the means by which it could be broken down into three pieces for stowage. In use, it still presents all the issues of the admiralty pattern anchor.\n\n=== Northill anchor ===\nOriginally designed as a lightweight anchor for seaplanes, this design consists of two plough-like blades mounted to a shank, with a folding stock crossing through the crown of the anchor.\n\n=== CQR (secure) plough anchor ===\n[[Image:Genuine CQR.jpg|thumb|right|CQR anchor]]\nSo named due to its resemblance to a traditional agricultural [[plough]] (or more specifically two [[plowshare|ploughshares]]), many manufacturers produce a plough-style design, all based on or direct copies of the original CQR (\"Secure\"), a 1933 design patented in the UK (US patent in 1934<ref>{{cite patent\n | country = us\n | number = 1974933\n | status = patent\n | title = Anchor\n | gdate = 1934-09-25\n | fdate = 1934-02-28\n | inventor = G.

They are generally good in all bottoms, but not exceptional in any. The CQR design has a hinged shank.  Despite the widely held belief that this is to allow the anchor to turn with direction changes rather than breaking out, the actual purpose is to prevent the weight of the shank from negatively impacting the fluke's orientation while setting.<ref>http://www.petersmith.net.nz/boat-anchors/docs/cqr-plow-anchor-us-patent-1934.pdf</ref> Other plough types have a rigid shank. Plough anchors are usually stowed in a roller at the bow.\n\nOwing to the use of lead or other dedicated tip-weight, the plough is heavier than average for the amount of resistance developed, and may take more careful technique and a longer period to set thoroughly. It cannot be stored in a hawsepipe.\n\n=== Delta anchor ===\nThe Delta was developed in the 1980s for commercialization by British marine manufacturer Simpson\u2013Lawrence. It is a plough anchor with a rigid, arched shank. It is described as ''self-launching'' because it can be dropped from a bow roller simply by paying out the rode, without manual assistance.\n\n===Danforth anchor ===\n[[Image:Fluke anchor-1-.gif|thumb|right|A fluke-style anchor]]\nAmerican [[Richard Danforth]] invented the Danforth pattern in the 1940s for use aboard [[landing craft]]. It uses a stock at the crown to which two large flat triangular flukes are attached. The stock is hinged so the flukes can orient toward the bottom (and on some designs may be adjusted for an optimal angle depending on the bottom type). Tripping palms at the crown act to tip the flukes into the seabed. The design is a burying variety, and once well set can develop high resistance. Its lightweight and compact flat design make it easy to retrieve and relatively easy to store; some anchor rollers and hawsepipes can accommodate a fluke-style anchor.\n\nA Danforth will not usually penetrate or hold in gravel or weeds. In boulders and coral it may hold by acting as a hook. If there is much current, or if the vessel is moving while dropping the anchor, it may \"kite\" or \"skate\" over the bottom due to the large fluke area acting as a sail or wing.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jim Howard|author2=Charles J.

The Bruce and its copies, known generically as \"claws\", have become a popular option for small boaters. It was intended to address some of the problems of the only general-purpose option then available, the plough. Claw-types set quickly in most seabeds and although not an articulated design, they have the reputation of not breaking out with tide or wind changes, instead slowly turning in the bottom to align with the force.\n\nClaw types have difficulty penetrating weedy bottoms and grass. They offer a fairly low holding-power-to-weight ratio and generally have to be oversized to compete with newer types.{{citation needed | date= October 2012}} On the other hand, they have a good reputation in boulder bottoms, perform relatively well with low rode scopes and set fairly reliably. They cannot be used with hawsepipes.\n\n=== Recent designs ===\n[[File:Genuine Rocna.jpg|thumb|right|Rocna anchor]]\nIn recent years there has been something of a spurt in anchor design. Primarily designed to set very quickly, then generate high holding power, these anchors (mostly proprietary inventions still under [[patent]]) are finding homes with users of small to medium-sized vessels.\n* The German-designed bow anchor, '''B\u00fcgelanker''' (or '''Wasi'''), has a sharp tip for penetrating weed, and features a roll-bar which allows the correct setting attitude to be achieved without the need for extra weight to be inserted into the tip.<ref>Ginsberg-Klemmt, Erika & Achim, and Poiraud, Alain (2007) ''The Complete Anchoring Handbook'', Ragged Mountain Press, {{ISBN|0-07-147508-7}}</ref>\n* The '''Bulwagga''' is a unique design featuring three flukes instead of the usual two. It has performed well in tests by independent sources such as American boating magazine ''Practical Sailor''.<ref>Practical Sailor: \"Anchor Reset Tests\", Belvoir Pubs, January 2001</ref>\n* The '''Spade''' is a French design which has proved successful since 1996. It features a demountable shank (hollow in some instances) and the choice of galvanized steel, stainless steel, or aluminium construction, which means a lighter and more easily stowable anchor.<ref>Poiraud, Alain (2003) ''Tout savoir sur le mouillage'', Loisirs Nautiques, {{ISBN|2-914423-46-2}}</ref>\n* The New Zealand\u2013designed '''Rocna''' has been produced since 2004. It too features a sharp toe like the B\u00fcgel for penetrating weed and grass, sets quickly,<ref>Lowe, Colin: \"Gear Test: Rocna Anchor\", Boating NZ, July 2006</ref> and has a large fluke area. Its roll-bar is also similar to that of the B\u00fcgel.\n* The British made '''Knox Anchor''' produced in Scotland was invented by Professor [[John Knox (chemist)|John Knox]]. It has a divided concave large area fluke arrangement and a shank in high tensile steel. A roll bar similar to the Rocna gives fast setting and a holding power of about 40 times anchor weight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knoxanchors.com/performance-comparison2/|title=Performance Comparison|website=Knox Anchors|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-10}}</ref>\n[[File:9kg knox.jpg|thumb|Knox Anchor]]\n\n=== Other temporary anchors ===\n* '''Mud weight''': Consists of a blunt heavy weight, usually cast iron or cast lead, that will sink into the mud and resist lateral movement. Suitable only for very soft silt bottoms and in mild conditions. Sizes range between 5 and 20&nbsp;kg for small craft. Various designs exist and many are home produced from lead or improvised with heavy objects. This is a very commonly used method on the [[Norfolk Broads]] in England.\n\n== Permanent anchors ==\nThese are used where the vessel is permanently or semi-permanently sited, for example in the case of [[lightvessel]]s or channel marker [[buoy]]s. The anchor needs to hold the vessel in all weathers, including the most severe [[storm]], but needs to be lifted only occasionally, at most \u2013 for example, only if the vessel is to be towed into port for maintenance. An alternative to using an anchor under these circumstances, especially if the anchor need never be lifted at all, may be to use a [[Deep foundation|pile]] [[Pile driver|driven]] into the seabed.\n\nPermanent anchors come in a wide range of types and have no standard form. A slab of rock with an iron staple in it to attach a chain to would serve the purpose, as would any dense object of appropriate weight (for instance, an [[Cylinder block|engine block]]). Modern moorings may be anchored by sand screws, which look and act very much like oversized [[screw]]s drilled into the seabed, or by barbed metal beams pounded in (or even driven in with explosives) like pilings, or by a variety of other non-mass means of getting a grip on the bottom. One method of building a mooring is to use three or more conventional anchors laid out with short lengths of chain attached to a swivel, so no matter which direction the vessel moves, one or more anchors will be aligned to resist the force.\n\n===Mushroom anchor===\n[[File:Portsmouth with mushroom anchor.jpg|thumb|Mushroom anchor on the [[lightvessel|lightship]] ''Portsmouth'' in [[Virginia]].]]\nThe mushroom anchor is suitable where the seabed is composed of silt or fine sand.  It was invented by [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]], for use by an 82-ton converted fishing boat, ''Pharos'', which was used as a [[lightvessel]] between 1807 and 1810 near to [[Inchcape|Bell Rock]] whilst the [[Bell Rock Lighthouse|lighthouse]] was being constructed. It was equipped with a 1.5-ton example.\n\nIt is shaped like an inverted mushroom, the head becoming buried in the silt.  A counterweight is often provided at the other end of the shank to lay it down before it becomes buried.\n\nA mushroom anchor will normally sink in the silt to the point where it has displaced its own weight in bottom material, thus greatly increasing its holding power. These anchors are only suitable for a silt or mud bottom, since they rely upon suction and cohesion of the bottom material, which rocky or coarse sand bottoms lack. The holding power of this anchor is at best about twice its weight until it becomes buried, when it can be as much as ten times its weight.<ref>[http://www.acegroup.com/us-en/assets/moorings.pdf Moorings]. INAMAR. acegroup.com</ref>  They are available in sizes from about 5&nbsp;kg up to several tons.\n\n===Deadweight anchor===\nThis is an anchor which relies solely on being a heavy weight. It is usually just a large block of concrete or stone at the end of the chain. Its holding power is defined by its weight underwater (i.e. taking its buoyancy into account) regardless of the type of seabed, although suction can increase this if it becomes buried. Consequently, deadweight anchors are used where mushroom anchors are unsuitable, for example in rock, gravel or coarse sand. An advantage of a deadweight anchor over a mushroom is that if it does become dragged, then it continues to provide its original holding force. The disadvantage of using deadweight anchors in conditions where a mushroom anchor could be used is that it needs to be around ten times the weight of the equivalent mushroom anchor.\n\n===Screw anchor===\nScrew anchors can be used to anchor permanent moorings, floating docks, fish farms, etc. These anchors must be screwed into the seabed with the use of a tool, so require access to the bottom, either at low tide or by use of a diver. Hence they can be difficult to install in deep water without special equipment.\n\nWeight for weight, screw anchors have a higher holding than other permanent designs, and so can be cheap and relatively easily installed, although may not be ideal in extremely soft mud.\n\n===High-holding-power anchors===\nThere is a need in the oil-and-gas industry to resist large anchoring forces when laying pipelines and for drilling vessels.  These anchors are installed and removed using a support tug and pennant/pendant wire.  Some examples are the Stevin range supplied by Vrijhof Ankers.  Large plate anchors such as the Stevmanta are used for permanent moorings.\n\n== Anchoring gear ==\n[[File:AS HMAS Canberra 1.jpg|thumb|Naval anchor incorporated into {{HMAS|Canberra|1927|6}} memorial, [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]]]\nThe elements of anchoring gear include the anchor, the cable (also called a '''''rode'''''), the method of attaching the two together, the method of attaching the cable to the ship, charts, and a method of learning the depth of the water.\n\nVessels may carry a number of anchors: '''''bower anchors''''' (formerly known as ''[[sheet anchor]]s'' {{cn|date=December 2017}}) are the main anchors used by a vessel and normally carried at the bow of the vessel.  A '''''kedge anchor''''' is a light anchor used for [[Warping (sailing)|warping an anchor]], also known as ''kedging'', or more commonly on yachts for [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] quickly or in benign conditions.  A '''''stream anchor''''', which is usually heavier than a ''kedge anchor'', can be used for kedging or warping in addition to temporary mooring and restraining stern movement in tidal conditions or in waters where vessel movement needs to be restricted, such as rivers and channels.<ref>[http://www.wordnik.com/words/stream-anchor Stream Anchor], wordnik.com</ref>  A '''''Killick anchor''''' is a small, possibly improvised, anchor.<ref>[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-kil1.htm World Wide Words]. World Wide Words (30 August 2003). Retrieved on 2013-03-30.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080319014210/http://www.pussers.com/scuttlebutt/view/33 The \"Pusser's Anchor\"]. pussers.com</ref>\n\nCharts are vital to good anchoring. Knowing the location of potential dangers, as well as being useful in estimating the effects of weather and tide in the anchorage, is essential in choosing a good place to drop the hook. One can get by without referring to charts, but they are an important tool and a part of good anchoring gear, and a skilled mariner would not choose to anchor without them.\n\nThe depth of water is necessary for determining '''''scope''''', which is the ratio of length of cable to the depth measured from the highest point (usually the anchor roller or bow chock) to the seabed. For example, if the water is {{convert|8|m|ft|0}} deep, and the anchor roller is {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the water, the scope is the ratio between the amount of cable let out and {{convert|9|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. For this reason it is important to have a reliable and accurate method of measuring the depth of water.\n\nA cable or rode is the rope, chain, or combination thereof used to connect the anchor to the vessel.\n\nChain rode is relatively heavy but resists abrasion from coral, sharp rocks, or shellfish beds which may abrade a pure rope warp. Fibre rope is more susceptible to abrasion on the seabed or obstructions, and is more likely to fail without warning.\n\nCombinations of a length of chain shackled to the anchor, with rope added to the other end of the chain are a common compromise on small craft.\n\n==Anchor warps==\nThe best rope for warps is  nylon which is strong and flexible. Terylene (polyester) is stronger but has less flex. Both ropes sink, so they avoid fouling other craft in crowded anchorages and do not absorb much water. Neither breaks down quickly in sunlight. Polypropylene or polythene are not suited to warps as they float and are much weaker than nylon and only slightly stronger than natural fibres. They break down in sunlight. Natural fibres such as manila or hemp are still used in developing nations but absorb much water, are relatively weak and rot. They do give good grip and are often very cheap. All anchors should have chain at least equal to the boat's length. Some skippers prefer an all chain warp for added security in coral waters. Boats less than 8&nbsp;m typically use 6&nbsp;mm galvanized chain. 8\u201314&nbsp;m craft use 9&nbsp;mm chain and over 14&nbsp;m use 12&nbsp;mm chain. The chain should be shackled to the warp through a steel eye or spliced to the chain using a chain splice. The shackle pin should be securely wired. Either galvanized or stainless steel is suitable for eyes and shackles.\n\nIn  moderate conditions the ratio of warp to water depth should be 4:1. In rough conditions it should be twice this with the extra length giving more stretch to resist the anchor breaking out. This means that small craft under 5&nbsp;m should carry at least 50&nbsp;m of 8&nbsp;mm warp. 5\u20138&nbsp;m craft 75\u2013100&nbsp;m of 10&nbsp;mm warp. 8\u201314&nbsp;m should carry 100\u2013125&nbsp;m of 12&nbsp;mm warp and over 16&nbsp;m the same length but 16&nbsp;mm warp.<ref>Safety in Small Craft.Ch 2. Royal NZ Coastguard Federation. Mike Scanlan. Auckland. 1994</ref>\n\n== Anchoring techniques ==\n[[File:Polarstern anchor-winch hg.jpg|thumb|Anchor winch, or windlass, on {{ship|RV|Polarstern}}]]\n[[File:Chain markers.jpg|thumb|Colored plastic inserts on a modern anchor chain show the operator how much chain has been paid out. This knowledge is very important in all anchoring methods]]\nThe basic anchoring consists of determining the location, dropping the anchor, laying out the scope, setting the hook, and assessing where the vessel ends up. The ship will seek a location which is sufficiently protected; has suitable holding ground, enough depth at low tide and enough room for the boat to swing.\n\nThe location to drop the anchor should be approached from down wind or down current, whichever is stronger. As the chosen spot is approached, the vessel should be stopped or even beginning to drift back. The anchor should be lowered quickly but under control until it is on the bottom (see [[anchor windlass]]). The vessel should continue to drift back, and the cable should be veered out under control so it will be relatively straight.\n\nOnce the desired scope is laid out, the vessel should be gently forced astern, usually using the auxiliary motor but possibly by backing a sail. A hand on the anchor line may telegraph a series of jerks and jolts, indicating the anchor is dragging, or a smooth tension indicative of digging in. As the anchor begins to dig in and resist backward force, the engine may be throttled up to get a thorough set. If the anchor continues to drag, or sets after having dragged too far, it should be retrieved and moved back to the desired position (or another location chosen.)\n\nThere are techniques of anchoring to limit the swing of a vessel if the anchorage has limited room:\n\n=== Using an anchor weight, kellet or sentinel ===\nLowering a concentrated, heavy weight down the anchor line \u2013 rope or chain \u2013 directly in front of the bow to the seabed behaves like a heavy chain rode and lowers the angle of pull on the anchor.<ref>Hinz, Earl R.; The Complete Book of Anchoring and Mooring, first ed., 1986, Cornell Maritime Press; {{ISBN|0-87033-348-8}}</ref> If the weight is suspended off the seabed it acts as a spring or shock absorber to dampen the sudden actions that are normally transmitted to the anchor and can cause it to dislodge and drag. In light conditions, a kellet will reduce the swing of the vessel considerably. In heavier conditions these effects disappear as the rode becomes straightened and the weight ineffective. Known as a \"anchor chum weight\" or \"angel\" in the UK.\n\n=== Forked moor ===\nUsing two anchors set approximately 45\u00b0 apart, or wider angles up to 90\u00b0, from the bow is a strong mooring for facing into strong winds. To set anchors in this way, first one anchor is set in the normal fashion. Then, taking in on the first cable as the boat is motored into the wind and letting slack while drifting back, a second anchor is set approximately a half-scope away from the first on a line perpendicular to the wind. After this second anchor is set, the scope on the first is taken up until the vessel is lying between the two anchors and the load is taken equally on each cable.\nThis moor also to some degree limits the range of a vessel's swing to a narrower oval. Care should be taken that other vessels will not swing down on the boat due to the limited swing range.\n\n=== Bow and stern ===\n(Not to be mistaken with the ''Bahamian moor'', below.) In the ''bow and stern'' technique, an anchor is set off each the bow and the stern, which can severely limit a vessel's swing range and also align it to steady wind, current or wave conditions. One method of accomplishing this moor is to set a bow anchor normally, then drop back to the limit of the bow cable (or to double the desired scope, e.g. 8:1 if the eventual scope should be 4:1, 10:1 if the eventual scope should be 5:1, etc.) to lower a stern anchor. By taking up on the bow cable the stern anchor can be set. After both anchors are set, tension is taken up on both cables to limit the swing or to align the vessel.\n\n=== Bahamian moor ===\nSimilar to the above, a ''Bahamian moor'' is used to sharply limit the swing range of a vessel, but allows it to swing to a current. One of the primary characteristics of this technique is the use of a swivel as follows: the first anchor is set normally, and the vessel drops back to the limit of anchor cable. A second anchor is attached to the end of the anchor cable, and is dropped and set. A swivel is attached to the middle of the anchor cable, and the vessel connected to that.\n\nThe vessel will now swing in the middle of two anchors, which is acceptable in strong reversing currents, but a wind perpendicular to the current may break out the anchors, as they are not aligned for this load.\n\n=== Backing an anchor ===\nAlso known as ''tandem anchoring'', in this technique two anchors are deployed in line with each other, on the same rode. With the foremost anchor reducing the load on the aft-most, this technique can develop great holding power and may be appropriate in \"ultimate storm\" circumstances. It does not limit swinging range, and might not be suitable in some circumstances. There are complications, and the technique requires careful preparation and a level of skill and experience above that required for a single anchor.\n\n=== Kedging ===\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0443 1.JPG|thumb|Statue of Peter the Great leaning on an anchor, in symbol of his shipbuilding activity ([[Voronezh]], 1860).]]\n''Kedging'' or ''[[Warping (sailing)|warping]]'' is a technique for moving or turning a ship by using a relatively light anchor.\n\nIn yachts, a kedge anchor is an anchor carried in addition to the main, or bower anchors, and usually stowed aft. Every yacht should carry at least two anchors \u2013 the main or ''bower'' anchor and a second lighter ''kedge'' anchor. It is used occasionally when it is necessary to limit the turning circle as the yacht swings when it is anchored, such as in a very narrow river or a deep pool in an otherwise shallow area.\n\nFor ships, a kedge may be dropped while a ship is underway, or carried out in a suitable direction by a tender or ship's boat to enable the ship to be winched off if aground or swung into a particular heading, or even to be held steady against a tidal or other stream.\n\nHistorically, it was of particular relevance to sailing warships which used them to outmaneuver opponents when the wind had dropped but might be used by any vessel in confined, shoal water to place it in a more desirable position, provided she had enough manpower.\n\n==== Club hauling ====\nClub hauling is an archaic technique. When a vessel is in a narrow channel or on a lee shore so that there is no room to tack the vessel in a conventional manner, an anchor attached to the lee quarter may be dropped from the lee bow.  This is deployed when the vessel is head to wind and has lost headway.  As the vessel gathers sternway the strain on the cable pivots the vessel around what is now the weather quarter turning the vessel onto the other tack.  The anchor is then normally cut away, as it cannot be recovered.<ref>Liardet, Francis (1849) [http://www.sjohistoriskasamfundet.se/LB/Nautica/Seamanship/Liardet/Liardet%281849%29_p72.html Professional Recollections on Points of Seamanship] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029213748/http://www.sjohistoriskasamfundet.se/LB/Nautica/Seamanship/Liardet/Liardet(1849)_p72.html |date=29 October 2010 }}, Discipline, &c.</ref><ref>[http://www.psych.usyd.edu.au/vbb/woronora/maritime/working.html General Principles of Working a Ship, from The New Practical Navigator (1814)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040820184758/http://www.psych.usyd.edu.au/vbb/woronora/maritime/working.html |date=20 August 2004 }}. psych.usyd.edu.au</ref>\n\n[[Image:Triple Entente.jpg|thumb|right|A 1914 Russian poster depicting the [[Triple Entente]]. Britannia's association with the oceanic [[British Empire]] is indicated by her holding a large anchor.]]\n\n==In heraldry==\nAn anchor frequently appears on the flags and coats of arms of institutions involved with the sea, both naval and commercial, as well as of port cities and seacoast regions and provinces in various countries. There also exists in heraldry the \"[[Anchored Cross]]\", or [[St. Clement's Cross|Mariner's Cross]], a stylized cross in the shape of an anchor. The symbol can be used to signify 'fresh start' or 'hope'. The New Testament refers to the Christian's hope as \"an anchor of the soul\" ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+6.19&version=NASB Hebrews 6:19]).  In 1887, the Delta Gamma Fraternity adopted the anchor as its badge to signify hope. The Mariner's Cross is also referred to as [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement's Cross]], in reference to the way this saint was martyred (being tied to an anchor and thrown from a boat into the [[Black Sea]] in 102). Anchored crosses are occasionally a feature of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] in which context they are referred to by the [[heraldry|heraldic]] terms ''anchry'' or ''ancre''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Anchor coinage]]\n*[[Anchorage (shipping)]]\n*[[Digital Anchor]]\n*[[Fouled anchor]]\n*[[History of the anchor]]\n*[[Sea anchor]]\n*[[Sheet anchor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Blackwell, Alex & Daria; ''Happy Hooking \u2013 the Art of Anchoring,'' 2008, 2011 White Seahorse; {{ISBN|978-0-9815171-0-0}}\n* Edwards, Fred; ''Sailing as a Second Language: An illustrated dictionary,'' 1988 Highmark Publishing; {{ISBN|0-87742-965-0}}\n* Hinz, Earl R.; ''The Complete Book of Anchoring and Mooring, Rev. 2d ed.,'' 1986, 1994, 2001 Cornell Maritime Press; {{ISBN|0-87033-539-1}}\n* Hiscock, Eric C.; ''Cruising Under Sail, second edition,'' 1965 Oxford University Press; {{ISBN|0-19-217522-X}}\n* Pardey, Lin and Larry; ''The Capable Cruiser''; 1995 Pardey Books/Paradise Cay Publications; {{ISBN|0-9646036-2-4}}\n* Rousmaniere, John; ''The Annapolis Book of Seamanship,'' 1983, 1989 Simon and Schuster; {{ISBN|0-671-67447-1}}\n* Smith, Everrett; ''Cruising World's Guide to Seamanship: Hold me tight,'' 1992 New York Times Sports/Leisure Magazines\n\n==Further reading==\n* William N.

Under the early [[Roman Empire]] the place was known as '''Caesarea''', and was the Metropolis (capital) of Late [[Roman province]] [[Cilicia Secunda]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> It was the home of the poet [[Oppian]].\n \nRebuilt by the [[Eastern Roman emperor]] [[Justin I]] after an [[earthquake]] in the 6th century, it became '''Justinopolis''' (525); but the old native name persisted, and when [[Thoros I of Armenia|Thoros I]], king of [[Lesser Armenia]], made it his capital early in the 12th century, it was known as '''Anazarva'''.\n\n== Remains ==\nIts great natural strength and situation, not far from the mouth of the Sis pass, and near the great road which [[debouches|debouched]] from the [[Cilician Gates]], made Anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the early Muslim invaders. It had been rebuilt by [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 796, refortified at great expense by the [[Hamdanid]] [[Sayf al-Dawla]]<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> (mid-10th century) and again destroyed in 962 by [[Nikephoros II Phokas]].\n\nIn late 1097 or early 1098 it was captured by the armies of the [[First Crusade]] and was incorporated into Bohemond's Principality of Antioch.  The Crusaders are probably responsible for the construction of an impressive donjon atop the center of the outcrop.  Most of the remaining fortifications, including the curtain walls, massive horse-shaped towers, undercrofts, cisterns, and free-standing structures date from the Armenian periods of occupation, which began with the arrival of the [[Thoros I, Prince of Armenia|Rubenid Baron T\u201boros I]], {{circa|1111}}.<ref name=\"edwards\">{{cite book| last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII |date=1987 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University| location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-88402-163-7|pages=65\u201372, 281, pls.9a\u201318b, 287b\u2013289c}}</ref>  The site briefly exchanged hands between the Greeks and Armenians, until it was formally part of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].

It encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine [[triumphal arch]], the colonnades of two streets, a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], etc. A stadium and a theatre lie outside the walls to the south. The remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting, including roads and ditches hewn in the rock. There are no notable structures in the upper town. For picturesqueness the site is not equaled in Cilicia, and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s to their sources.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>  A necropolis on the escarpment to the south of the curtain wall can also be seen complete with signs of illegal modern excavations.\n\nA visit in December 2002 showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed. Only small, isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood. A powerful earthquake that struck the area in 1945 is thought to be responsible for the destruction.\n\nA modest Turkish farming village ([[Dilekkaya, Kozan|Dilekkaya]]) lies to the southwest of the ancient city. A small outdoor museum with some of the artifacts collected in the area can be viewed for a small fee. Also nearby are some beautiful mosaics discovered in a farmers field.  Inquire at the museum for a viewing.\n\nAnazarbus/Anavarsa was one of a chain of Armenian fortifications stretching through Cilicia.  The [[Sis (ancient city)|castle of Sis]] (modern [[Kozan, Adana]]) lies to the north while Tumlu Castle and [[Yilankale]] are to the south, and the fortresses of [[Amouda]] and [[Sarvandikar]] are to the east.\n\nIn 2013, excavations uncovered the first known colonnaded double-lane road of the ancient world, 34 meters wide and 2700 meters long, also uncovered the ruins of a church and a bathhouse.<ref name=\"dailysabah.com\">[https://www.dailysabah.com/history/2017/11/26/statue-of-hygieia-and-eros-uncovered-in-southern-turkey Statue of Hygieia and Eros uncovered in southern Turkey]</ref>\n\nIn 2017, archaeologists discovered a limestone statue of the goddess [[Hygieia]] and the god [[Eros]].

Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram. Someone who creates anagrams may be called an \"anagrammatist\",<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anagrammatist Anagrammatist], Dictionary.com. Retrieved on 2008-08-12.</ref> and the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject.\n\n==Examples==\nAnagrams don't necessarily have to use all the letters, but they normally do.\n\nAnagrams may be created as a commentary on the subject. They may be a synonym or antonym of their subject, a parody, a criticism or satire. For example:\n\n* \"rail safety\" = \"fairy tales\"\n* \"roast beef\" = \"eat for [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]\" <ref>[http://www.anagrammy.com/botr/author/Mick%20Tully/norude Anagrammy]</ref>\n* \"[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]\" = \"livEs\" or \"lives\"\nAn anagram which means the opposite of its subject is called an \"antigram\".

They became hugely popular in the Early Modern period, especially in Germany.<ref>[https://medium.com/in-medias-res/secrets-of-a-lost-art-part-1-latin-anagrams-aa05739e5400]</ref>\n\nAny historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings that were current for the language in question. In particular, spelling in English only slowly became fixed. There were attempts to regulate anagram formation, an important one in English being that of [[George Puttenham]]'s ''Of the Anagram or Posy Transposed'' in ''The Art of English Poesie'' (1589).\n\n===Influence of Latin===\nAs a literary game when Latin was the common property of the literate, Latin anagrams were prominent.<ref>[https://medium.com/in-medias-res/secrets-of-a-lost-art-part-1-latin-anagrams-aa05739e5400]</ref>. Two examples are the change of \"[[Ave Maria]], gratia plena, Dominus tecum\" (''Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord [is] with you'') into \"Virgo serena, pia, munda et immaculata\" (''Serene virgin, pious, clean and spotless''), and the anagrammatic answer to [[Pilate]]'s question, \"Quid est veritas?\" (''What is truth?''), namely, \"Est vir qui adest\" (''It is the man who is here''). The origins of these are not documented.\n\nLatin continued to influence letter values (such as I = J, U = V and W = VV). There was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be \"perfect\" if the letters were all used once, but allowing for these interchanges. This can be seen in a popular Latin anagram against the [[Jesuits]]: \"Societas Jesu\" turned into \"Vitiosa seces\", or \"Cut off the wicked things\". Puttenham, in the time of [[Elizabeth I of England]], wished to start from ''Elissabet Anglorum Regina'' (Elizabeth Queen of the English), to obtain ''Multa regnabis ense gloria'' (By thy sword shalt thou reign in great renown); he explains carefully that H is \"a note of aspiration only and no letter\", and that Z in Greek or Hebrew is a mere SS. The rules were not completely fixed in the 17th century. [[William Camden]] in his ''Remains'' commented, singling out some letters\u2014\u00c6, K, W, and Z\u2014not found in the classical Roman alphabet:<ref>Cited in Henry Benjamin Wheatley, ''Of anagrams: a monograph treating of their history'' (1862); [https://archive.org/details/ofanagramsmonogr00wheauoft online text.]</ref>\n\n{{quote|The precise in this practice strictly observing all the parts of the definition, are only bold with H either in omitting or retaining it, for that it cannot challenge the right of a letter.

The lawyer [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Thomas Egerton]] was praised through the anagram ''gestat honorem'' ('he carries honor'); the physician [[George Ent]] took the anagrammatic motto ''genio surget'' ('he rises through spirit/genius'), which requires his first name as ''Georgius''.<ref>Articles from the ''Dictionary of National Biography.{{Page needed|date=October 2017}}</ref> [[James I of England|James I's]] courtiers discovered in \"James Stuart\" \"a just master\", and converted \"[[Charles II of England|Charles James Stuart]]\" into \"Claims [[King Arthur|Arthur]]'s seat\" (even at that point in time, the letters I and J were more-or-less interchangeable).

The German poet [[Unica Z\u00fcrn]], who made extensive use of anagram techniques, came to regard obsession with anagrams as a \"dangerous fever\", because it created isolation of the author.<ref>Friederike Ursula Eigler, Susanne Kord, The Feminist Encyclopedia of German Literature (1997), pp. 14\u20135.</ref> The surrealist leader [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] coined the anagram ''Avida Dollars'' for [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], to tarnish his reputation by the implication of commercialism.\n\n==Applications==\nWhile anagramming is certainly a recreation first, there are ways in which anagrams are put to use, and these can be more serious, or at least not quite frivolous and formless. For example, psychologists use anagram-oriented tests, often called \"anagram solution tasks\", to assess the [[implicit memory]] of young adults and adults alike.<ref name = Java>Java, Rosalind I. \"Priming and Aging: Evidence of Preserved Memory Function in an Anagram Solution Task.\" ''The American Journal of Psychology'', Vol. 105, No. 4.

Upon confirming his observations, three years later he revealed it to mean \"Annuto cingitur, tenui, plano, nusquam coherente, ad eclipticam inclinato\"; that is, \"It [Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic\".<ref name = \"Campbell1937\">{{Cite book | last = Campbell | first = John W., Jr. | author-link = John W.

For example, [[Jim Morrison]] used an anagram of his name in [[The Doors]] song ''[[L.A. Woman (song)|L.A. Woman]]'', calling himself \"Mr. Mojo Risin'\". The use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names, as happened in the 18th century when [[Edward Cave]] wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].<ref>[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/pooleyj.html Institute of Historical Research (IHR) home page]</ref> In a genre such as [[farce]] or [[parody]], anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect.\n\nPseudonyms adopted by authors are sometimes transposed forms of their names; thus \"[[John Calvin|Calvinus]]\" becomes \"Alcuinus\" (here V = U) or \"[[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]\" = \"Alcofribas Nasier\". The name \"[[Voltaire]]\" of Fran\u00e7ois Marie Arouet fits this pattern, and is allowed to be an anagram of \"Arouet, l[e] j[eune]\" (U = V, J = I) that is, \"Arouet the younger\". Other examples include\n\n* \"[[Damon Albarn]]\" = \"Dan Abnormal\"\n* \"[[Dave Barry]]\" = \"Ray Adverb\"\n* \"[[Arrigo Boito]]\" = \"Tobia Gorrio\"\n* \"[[Buckethead]]\" = \"Death Cube K\"\n* \"[[Daniel Clowes]]\" = \"[[Enid Coleslaw]]\"\n*\"[[Siobh\u00e1n Donaghy]]\" = \"Shanghai Nobody\"\n* \"[[Glen Duncan]]\" = \"Declan Gunn\"<ref>[[I, Lucifer (Glen Duncan)]]</ref>\n* \"[[Edward Gorey]]\" = \"Ogdred Weary\", = \"Regera Dowdy\" or = \"E.

Examples:\n* [[Homer Hickam, Jr.]]'s book ''[[Rocket Boys]]'' was adapted into the 1999 film ''[[October Sky]]''.<ref name=\"CB\">{{cite web|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=9217|title=Anagrams|last=Lundin|first=Leigh|date=2009-11-29|work=Word Play|publisher=Criminal Brief}}</ref>\n* The tapes for the revival of the [[BBC]] show [[Doctor Who]] were labeled with the anagram ''Torchwood'', which later went on to be used as the name for a [[Torchwood|spin-off show]].\n* The 1980s TV series ''[[The A-Team]]'' had a Season 1 anagram episode called \"Black Day at Bad Rock\", a word play on the 1955 Spenser Tracy [[Western (genre)|western]] movie, ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]''.\n* The New Wave band [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]]' best-selling album was called ''[[Spring Session M]]''.\n* Hip-hop artist [[MF DOOM]] recorded a 2004 album called ''[[Mm.. Food|MM..FOOD]]''.\n* [[Brian Eno]]'s album ''Before and After Science'' includes a song entitled \"King's Lead Hat\", an anagram of \"[[Talking Heads]]\", a band Eno has worked with.\n* [[Juan Maria Solare]]'s piano ballad \"Jura ser anomal\u00eda\" (literally \"he/she swears to be an anomaly\") is an anagram of the composer's full name. His composition for [[English horn]] titled \"A Dot in Time\" is an anagram of \"Meditation\", which describes the piece. The title of his piano piece that is an homage to Claude Debussy is \"Seduce Us Badly\".\n* [[Bill Evans]]'s [[overdubbed]] piano elegy for fellow jazz pianist [[Sonny Clark]] is titled \"N.Y.C.'s No Lark,\" and another composition, \"Re: Person I Knew\" is a tribute to his producer, [[Orrin Keepnews]].\n* The title of [[Imogen Heap]]'s album ''[[iMegaphone]]'' is an anagram of her name.\n* Progressive rock group [[Rush (band)|Rush]] published a song off their 1989 album ''[[Presto (album)|Presto]]'' titled \"Anagram (for Mongo)\" that makes use of anagrams in every line of their song.\n* The title of the fifth album by American rock band [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], ''[[El Pintor (Interpol album)|El Pintor]]'', is an anagram of the band's name and also Spanish for \"the painter\".\n* Many of the song titles on Aphex Twin's ''[[...I Care Because You Do]]'' are anagrams of either \"Aphex Twin\", \"The Aphex Twin\", or \"Richard D James\".\n* In [[Disney's]] 1964 film [[Mary Poppins]], [[Dick Van Dyke]] played Mr. Dawes, Sr., as the anagram of his name, Navckid Keyd. In the credits, the words unscrambled themselves to reveal his name.\n\n===Coincidences===\nIn Hebrew, the name \"[[Gernot Zippe]]\" (\u05d2\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5\u05d8 \u05e6\u05d9\u05e4\u05d4), the inventor of the [[Zippe-type centrifuge]], is an anagram of the word \"centrifuge\" (\u05e6\u05e0\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05d2\u05d4).\n\n===Games and puzzles===\nAnagrams are in themselves a recreational activity, but they also make up part of many other games, puzzles and game shows. The [[Jumble]] is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the United States requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution. [[Cryptic crossword]] puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues, usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like \"confused\" or \"in disarray\". An example would be ''Businessman burst into tears (9 letters)''. The solution, ''stationer'', is an anagram of ''into tears'', the letters of which have ''burst'' out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of ''businessman''.\n\nNumerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as a basic skill. Some examples:\n* In [[Anagrams]], players flip tiles over one at a time and race to take words. They can \"steal\" each other's words by rearranging the letters and extending the words.\n* In a version of [[Scrabble]] called [[Clabbers]], the name itself being an anagram of Scrabble, tiles may be placed in any order on the board as long as they anagram to a valid word.\n* On the British game show ''[[countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', contestants are given 30 seconds to make the longest word from nine random letters.\n* In [[Boggle]], players make constrained words from a grid of sixteen random letters, by joining adjacent cubes.\n* On the British game show ''[[BrainTeaser]]'', contestants are shown a word broken into randomly arranged segments and must announce the whole word. At the end of the game there is a \"Pyramid\" which starts with a three-letter word. A letter appears in the line below to which the player must add the existing letters to find a solution. The pattern continues until the player reaches the final eight-letter anagram. The player wins the game by solving all the anagrams within the allotted time.\n* In [[Bananagrams]], players place tiles from a pool into [[Crossword|crossword-style]] word arrangements in a race to see who can finish the pool of tiles first.\n* Other anagram games include [[Bonza (Word Game)]], [[Bookworm (video game)]], [[Dabble]], [[Jumble]], [[Letterpress (video game)]], [[Perquackey]], [[Puzzlage]], [[Word Force]], [[WordSpot]], and [[Words with Friends]].\n\n===Ciphers===<!-- This section  heading is linked to in [[Rasterschl\u00fcssel 44]] if you change it, please change it their as well. -->\nMultiple anagramming is a technique used to solve some kinds of cryptograms, such as a [[permutation cipher]], a [[transposition cipher]], and the [[Jefferson disk]].<ref>[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/cryptdict/page55.htm Bletchley Park Cryptographic Dictionary]. Codesandciphers.org.uk. Retrieved on 2014-05-12.</ref> Solutions may be computationally found using a [[Jumble algorithm]].\n\n==Methods of construction==\nSometimes, it is possible to \"see\" anagrams in words, unaided by tools, though the more letters involved the more difficult this becomes. [[Anagram dictionary|Anagram dictionaries]] could also be used. Computer programs, known as \"anagram servers\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Internet Anagram Server|url=https://wordsmith.org/anagram/}}</ref> \"anagram solvers\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.word-grabber.com/anagram-solver|title=Anagram Solver {{!}} Finding cool and funny Anagrams|work=word-grabber.com|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref> or \"anagrammers\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastanagrammer.com/|title=Fast Anagrammer: Fastest on the web for Scrabble, Words with Friends, and other word games|website=www.fastanagrammer.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref>, offer a much faster route to creating anagrams, and a large number of these programs are available on the Internet.\n\nThe [[Computer program|program]] or [[Server (computing)|server]] carries out an exhaustive search of a database of words, to produce a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase using a [[jumble algorithm]]. Some programs (such as ''Lexpert'') restrict to one-word answers. Many anagram servers (for example, [http://findwords.online4me.com The Words Oracle]) can control the search results, by excluding or including certain words, limiting the number or length of words in each anagram, or limiting the number of results. Anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games. The disadvantage of computer anagram solvers, especially when applied to multi-word anagrams, is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating. They usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations. Some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often. This approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations.\n\nSome anagrammatists indicate the method they used. Anagrams constructed without aid of a computer are noted as having been done \"manually\" or \"by hand\"; those made by utilizing a computer may be noted \"by machine\" or \"by computer\", or may indicate the name of the computer program (using ''Anagram Genius'').\n\nThere are also a few \"natural\" instances: English words unconsciously created by switching letters around. The French ''chaise longue'' (\"long chair\") became the American \"[[chaise longue|chaise lounge]]\" by [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] (transposition of letters and/or sounds). It has also been speculated that the English \"curd\" comes from the Latin ''crudus'' (\"raw\"). Similarly, the ancient English word for bird was \"brid\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|anagram}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Acronym]]\n* [[Ambigram]]\n* [[Anagram dictionary]]\n* [[Anagrammatic poem]]\n* [[Anagrams]], a board game\n* [[Blanagram]]\n* [[Constrained writing]]\n* [[Isogram]]\n* [[Letter bank]]\n* [[Lipogram]]\n* [[List of geographic names derived from anagrams and ananyms]]\n* [[London Underground anagram map]]\n* [[Palindrome]]\n* [[Pangram]]\n* [[Rebus]]\n* [[Tautonym]]\n* [[Word play]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Henry Benjamin Wheatley]].

Its basin corresponds to the [[Anadyrsky District]] of Chukotka.\n\n==Geography==\nThe Anadyr is {{convert|1146|km}} long and has a basin of {{convert|191000|km2|-3}}. It is frozen from October to late May and has a maximum flow in June with the snowmelt.  It is navigable in small boats for about {{convert|570|km}} to near [[Markovo, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Markovo]]. West of Markovo it is in the Anadyr Highlands (moderate mountains and valleys with a few trees) and east of Markovo it moves into the Anadyr lowlands (very flat treeless tundra with lakes and bogs).  The drop from Markovo to the sea is less than {{convert|100|ft}}.\n\nIt rises at about 67\u00b0N latitude and 173\u00b0E longitude near the headwaters of the [[Maly Anyuy River]], flows southwest receiving the waters of the Yablon and Eropol Rivers, turns east and passes [[Markovo, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Markvovo]] and the old site of [[Anadyrsk]], turns north and east and receives the [[Mayn River]] from the south, thereby encircling the  Lebediny [[Zakaznik]], turns northeast to receive the [[Belaya River (Chukotka)]] from the north, turns southeast past the Ust-Tanyurer [[Zakaznik]] and receives the [[Tanyurer River]] from the north. At [[Lake Krasnoye (Chukotka)|Lake Krasnoye]], it turns east and flows into the Onemen Bay of the [[Anadyr Estuary]].  If the Onemen Bay is considered part of the river, it also receives the [[Velikaya River (Chukotka)]] from the south and the [[Kanchalan River]] from the north.\n\nIts basin is surrounded by (north) [[Amguyema River]] and [[Palyavaam River]], (northwest) [[Bolshoy Anyuy River]] and the Oloy branch of the [[Omolon River]] and (southwest) [[Penzhin Bay|Penzhina River]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1648 [[Semyon Dezhnyov|Semyon Dezhnev]] reached the mouth of the Anadyr after being shipwrecked on the coast.  In 1649 he went upriver and built winter quarters at [[Anadyrsk]]. For the next 100 years the Anadyr was the main route from the Arctic to the Pacific and Kamchatka. In the 18th century, the Anadyr was described by the polar explorer [[Dmitry Laptev]].\n\n==Ecology==\nThe country through which it passes is thinly populated, and is dominated by [[tundra]], with a rich variety of plant life.<ref>The area, which is still sparsely populated today, in 1911 it was described as \"thinly populated\" {{harv|Chisholm|1911}}.</ref> Much of the region has beautiful landscapes, dominated by often spectacular, rugged mountains. For nine months of the year the ground is covered with snow, and the frozen rivers become navigable roads.  George Kennan, an American working on the [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] in the late 1860s, found that dog sled travel on the lower Anadyr was limited by lack of firewood.\n\n[[Reindeer]], upon which the local inhabitants subsisted, were once found in considerable numbers,<ref>This point was made in 1911: \"Reindeer, upon which the inhabitants subsist, are found in considerable numbers\" {{harv|Chisholm|1911}}.</ref> but the domestic reindeer population has collapsed dramatically since the reorganization and privatization of state-run collective farms beginning in 1992. As herds of domestic reindeer have declined, herds of wild [[caribou]] have increased.\n\nThere are ten species of [[salmon]] inhabiting the Anadyr river basin.  Every year, on the last Sunday in April, there is an ice fishing competition in the frozen estuarine waters of the Anadyr River's mouth. This festival is locally known as '''Korfest'''.\n\nThe area is a summering place for a number of migratory birds including [[brent goose|brent geese]], [[Eurasian wigeon]]s, and the [[northern pintail|pintails]] of [[California]].{{sfn|Henny|1973|pp=23-29}}<ref>[http://www.werc.usgs.gov/pinsat/journal2001.html \"Biologist's Journal 2001\"  Western Ecological Research Center, United States Geological Survey]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Operation Anadyr]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{refimprove|date=October 2012}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite EB1911|ref=harv|wstitle=Anadyr|volume=1|page=907}}\n*{{cite journal|ref=harv |last=Henny |first=Charles J. |date=January 1973 |title=Drought Displaced Movement of North American Pintails into Siberia |journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=37 |number=1 |pages=23\u201329 |doi=10.2307/3799734}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.chukotka.org/en/tourism/about_tourism/kind_of_tourism/ \"Tourist and environmental information\"] Chukotka Autonomous Okrug website, in English\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071018001037/http://wildsalmoncenter.org/pops/AnadyrRiver.php \"Russia Far East: Anadyr River\" Wild Salmon Center]\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20080510105121/http://www.wildsalmoncenter.org/RapidAssessments/AnadyrRapidAssessment.pdf Anadyr River Watershed]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090305111407/http://www.faculty.uaf.edu/ffpag/snezhnoe.html \"Snezhnoye: a village on the Anadyr' River\"]\n\n{{coord|67|00|N|173|00|E|region:RU_source:jawiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Rivers of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of the Bering Sea]]", "sha1": "7y124sobm7hl87p35wn5fj3krb00y8h"}}, {"title": "Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re", "ns": "0", "id": "1363", "revision": {"id": "862587246", "parentid": "860228960", "timestamp": "2018-10-05T10:20:53Z", "contributor": {"username": "Srich32977", "id": "8372814"}, "comment": "Fixed typo", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{refimprove|date=June 2017}}\n{{Infobox scientist\n| name =  Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re\n| image = Ampere Andre 1825.jpg\n| caption = Engraving of Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re\n| birth_date = {{birth date|df=yes|1775|1|20}}\n| birth_place = [[Lyon]], [[Kingdom of France]]\n| death_date = {{death date and age|df=yes|1836|6|10|1775|1|20}}\n| death_place = [[Marseille]], [[July Monarchy|Kingdom of France]]\n| nationality = [[French people|French]]\n| field = [[Physics]]\n| work_institutions = [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]]\n| alma_mater = \n| doctoral_advisor = \n| doctoral_students = \n| known_for = [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law]], [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]]\n| author_abbrev_bot = \n| author_abbrev_zoo = \n| footnotes = \n| signature = Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re signature.svg\n}}\n'''Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|m|p|\u026a\u0259r}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ampere \"Amp\u00e8re\"].

An autodidact, Amp\u00e8re was a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and professor at the [[\u00c9cole polytechnique]] and the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]].\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of measurement of [[electric current]], the [[ampere]], is named after him. His name is also one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed]] on the [[Eiffel Tower]].\n\n==Early life==\nAndr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re was born on 20 January 1775 to Jean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re, a prosperous businessman, and Jeanne Antoinette Desuti\u00e8res-Sarcey Amp\u00e8re, during the height of the [[French Enlightenment]]. He spent his childhood and adolescence at the family property at [[Poleymieux-au-Mont-d'Or]] near Lyon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Andre-Marie_Ampere |title=Andre-Marie Ampere |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref> Jean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re, a successful merchant, was an admirer of the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], whose theories of education (as outlined in his treatise [[Emile, or On Education|\u00c9mile]]) were the basis of Amp\u00e8re's education. Rousseau believed that young boys should avoid formal schooling and pursue instead an \"education direct from nature.\" Amp\u00e8re's father actualized this ideal by allowing his son to educate himself within the walls of his well-stocked library. French Enlightenment masterpieces such as [[Georges Louis Leclerc, Count of Buffon|Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon]]'s ''Histoire naturelle, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et particuli\u00e8re'' (begun in 1749) and [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' (volumes added between 1751 and 1772) thus became Amp\u00e8re's schoolmasters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The young Amp\u00e8re, however, soon resumed his [[Latin]] lessons, which enabled him to master the works of [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amp\u00e8re, Andr\u00e9 Marie|volume=1|pages=878\u2013879}}</ref>\n\n==French Revolution==\nIn addition, Amp\u00e8re used his access to the latest books to begin teaching himself advanced mathematics at age 12. In later life Amp\u00e8re claimed that he knew as much about mathematics and science when he was eighteen as ever he knew; but, a [[polymath]], his reading embraced history, travels, poetry, philosophy, and the natural sciences.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His mother was a devout woman, so Amp\u00e8re was also initiated into the [[Catholicism|Catholic faith]] along with Enlightenment science. The [[French Revolution]] (1789\u201399) that began during his youth was also influential: Amp\u00e8re's father was called into [[Civil service|public service]] by the new revolutionary government,<ref>[http://simplyknowledge.com/popular/biography/andre-marie-ampere] Biography of Andre Marie Ampere</ref> becoming a justice of the peace in a small town near Lyon. When the [[Jacobin]] faction seized control of the Revolutionary government in 1792, his father Jean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re resisted the new political tides, and he was [[guillotine]]d on 24 November 1793, as part of the [[Jacobin#The Terror|Jacobin purges]] of the period.\n\nIn 1796 Amp\u00e8re met Julie Carron, and in 1799 they were married. Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re took his first regular job in 1799 as a [[mathematics]] teacher, which gave him the financial security to marry Carron and father his first child, [[Jean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re|Jean-Jacques]] (named after his father), the next year. (Jean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re eventually achieved his own fame as a scholar of languages). Amp\u00e8re's maturation corresponded with the transition to the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic regime]] in France, and the young father and teacher found new opportunities for success within the technocratic structures favoured by the new French [[Napoleon|First Consul]]. In 1802 Amp\u00e8re was appointed a professor of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] at the \u00c9cole Centrale in [[Bourg-en-Bresse]], leaving his ailing wife and infant son [[Jean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re|Jean-Jacques Antoine Amp\u00e8re]] in Lyon. He used his time in Bourg to research mathematics, producing ''Consid\u00e9rations sur la th\u00e9orie math\u00e9matique de jeu'' (1802; \"Considerations on the Mathematical Theory of Games\"), a treatise on [[Probability theory|mathematical probability]] that he sent to the [[Paris Academy of Sciences]] in 1803.\n\n==Teaching career==\n[[File:Amp\u00e8re - Essai sur la philosophie des sciences, 1838 - 3912601 323893 1 00011.tif|thumb|''Essai sur la philosophie des sciences'']]\nAfter the death of his wife in July 1803, Amp\u00e8re moved to [[Paris]], where he began a tutoring post at the new [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] in 1804. Despite his lack of formal qualifications, Amp\u00e8re was appointed a professor of mathematics at the school in 1809. As well as holding positions at this school until 1828, in 1819 and 1820 Amp\u00e8re offered courses in [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]], respectively, at the [[University of Paris]], and in 1824 he was elected to the prestigious chair in [[experimental physics]] at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]]. In 1814 Amp\u00e8re was invited to join the class of mathematicians in the new ''Institut Imp\u00e9rial'', the umbrella under which the reformed state Academy of Sciences would sit.\n\nAmp\u00e8re engaged in a diverse array of scientific inquiries during the years leading up to his election to the academy\u2014writing papers and engaging in topics from mathematics and philosophy to chemistry and astronomy, which was customary among the leading scientific intellectuals of the day. Amp\u00e8re claimed that \"at eighteen years he found three culminating points in his life, his [[First Communion]], the reading of Antoine Leonard Thomas's \"Eulogy of Descartes\", and the [[Taking of the Bastille]]. On the day of his wife's death he wrote two verses from the [[Psalm]]s, and the prayer, 'O Lord, God of Mercy, unite me in Heaven with those whom you have permitted me to love on earth.' In times of duress he would take refuge in the reading of the [[Bible]] and the [[Fathers of the Church]].\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Catholic Encyclopedia | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01437c.htm| doi = | accessdate = 29 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nFor a time he took into his family the young student [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ozanam]] (1813\u20131853), one of the founders of the [[Conference of Charity]], later known as the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]]. Through Amp\u00e8re, Ozanam had contact with leaders of the neo-Catholic movement, such as [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand]], [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire]], and [[Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert]]. Ozanam was [[Beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1998.\n\n==Work in electromagnetism==\n\nIn September 1820, Amp\u00e8re's friend and eventual eulogist [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]] showed the members of the French Academy of Sciences the surprising discovery of [[Denmark|Danish]] physicist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] that a [[Compass|magnetic needle]] is deflected by an adjacent [[electric current]]. Amp\u00e8re began developing a mathematical and physical theory to understand the relationship between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. Furthering \u00d8rsted's experimental work, Amp\u00e8re showed that two parallel wires carrying electric currents attract or repel each other, depending on whether the currents flow in the same or opposite directions, respectively - this laid the foundation of electrodynamics. He also applied mathematics in generalizing physical laws from these experimental results. The most important of these was the principle that came to be called [[Amp\u00e8re's force law|Amp\u00e8re's law]], which states that the mutual action of two lengths of current-carrying wire is proportional to their lengths and to the intensities of their currents. Amp\u00e8re also applied this same principle to magnetism, showing the harmony between his law and French physicist [[Charles Augustin de Coulomb]]'s law of magnetic action. Amp\u00e8re's devotion to, and skill with, experimental techniques anchored his science within the emerging fields of experimental physics.\n\nAmp\u00e8re also provided a physical understanding of the electromagnetic relationship, theorizing the existence of an \"electrodynamic molecule\" (the forerunner of the idea of the [[electron]]) that served as the component element of both electricity and magnetism. Using this physical explanation of electromagnetic motion, Amp\u00e8re developed a physical account of electromagnetic phenomena that was both empirically demonstrable and mathematically predictive. In 1827 Amp\u00e8re published his magnum opus, ''M\u00e9moire sur la th\u00e9orie math\u00e9matique des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes \u00e9lectrodynamiques uniquement d\u00e9duite de l\u2019experience'' (Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience), the work that coined the name of his new science, ''electrodynamics'', and became known ever after as its founding treatise.\n\nIn 1827 Amp\u00e8re was elected a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society]] and in 1828, a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Science]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27ampere%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate = 13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''8.10.1825''': Member of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]].<ref>Index biographique des membres et associ\u00e9s de l'Acad\u00e9mie royale de Belgique (1769\u20132005) p. 15</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nIn recognition of his contribution to the creation of modern electrical science, an international convention, signed at the 1881 [[International Exposition of Electricity]], established the [[Ampere (unit)|ampere]] as a standard unit of electrical measurement, along with the [[coulomb]], [[volt]], [[ohm]], and [[watt]], which are named, respectively, after Amp\u00e8re's contemporaries [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] of France, [[Alessandro Volta]] of [[Italy]], [[Georg Ohm]] of [[Germany]], and [[James Watt]] of [[Scotland]].

See [[#Liquid ammonia as a solvent|liquid ammonia as a solvent]].\n\n;Solvent properties: Ammonia is [[Miscibility|miscible]] with water. In an aqueous solution, it can be expelled by boiling. The [[water|aqueous]] solution of ammonia is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]]. The maximum concentration of ammonia in water (a [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] solution) has a [[density]] of 0.880 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and is often known as '.880 ammonia'. Ammonia does not burn readily or sustain [[combustion]], except under narrow fuel-to-air mixtures of 15\u201325% air.\n\n;Combustion: When mixed with [[oxygen]], it burns with a pale yellowish-green flame. At high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst, ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements. Ignition occurs when [[chlorine]] is passed into ammonia, forming nitrogen and [[hydrogen chloride]]; if chlorine is present in excess, then the highly explosive [[nitrogen trichloride]] (NCl<sub>3</sub>) is also formed.\n\n===Structure===\nThe ammonia molecule has a [[Trigonal pyramid (chemistry)|trigonal pyramidal]] shape as predicted by the [[valence shell electron pair repulsion theory]] (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7\u00b0.<ref name=\"CRC 94th\">{{cite book | editor= Haynes, William M. | year = 2013 | title = [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]] | edition = 94th | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | isbn = 9781466571143|pages=9\u201326}}</ref> The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one lone pair of electrons. The lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5\u00b0, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7\u00b0.<ref name=\"CRC 94th\"/> The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a [[Lone pair|lone electron pair]], which makes ammonia a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a [[dipole]] moment and makes it [[Polar molecule|polar]]. The molecule's polarity, and especially, its ability to form [[hydrogen bond]]s, makes ammonia highly miscible with water. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are [[Protonation|protonated]]. Temperature and [[salinity]] also affect the proportion of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. The latter has the shape of a regular [[tetrahedron]] and is [[isoelectronic]] with [[methane]].\n\nThe ammonia molecule readily undergoes [[nitrogen inversion]] at room temperature; a useful analogy is an [[umbrella]] turning itself inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol, and the [[resonance frequency]] is 23.79 [[Hertz|GHz]], corresponding to [[microwave]] radiation of a [[wavelength]] of 1.260&nbsp;cm. The absorption at this frequency was the first [[Microwave spectroscopy|microwave spectrum]] to be observed.<ref name=\"Cleeton\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.45.234|title=Electromagnetic Waves of {{convert|1.1|cm|0|abbr=on}}.

It combines with [[acid]]s to form [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s; thus with [[hydrochloric acid]] it forms [[ammonium chloride]] (sal ammoniac); with [[nitric acid]], [[ammonium nitrate]], etc. Perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry [[hydrogen chloride]]; moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=Influence of moisture on chemical change|author=Baker, H.

It is a protic substance and is capable of formation of amides (which contain the NH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> ion). For example, [[lithium]] dissolves in liquid ammonia to give a solution of [[lithium amide]]:\n\n: 2Li + 2NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 2LiNH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>\n\n===Self-dissociation===\nLike water, ammonia undergoes [[molecular autoionisation]] to form its [[conjugate acid|acid and base conjugates]]:\n:2 {{chem|NH|3}} (aq) {{eqm}} {{chem|NH|4|+}} (aq) + {{chem|NH|2|-}} (aq)\n\nAmmonia often functions as a [[weak base]], so it has some [[buffer solution|buffering]] ability. Shifts in pH will cause more or fewer [[ammonium]] cations ({{chem|NH|4|+}}) and amide anions ({{chem|NH|2|-}}) to be present in [[solution]]. At standard pressure and temperature, K=[{{chem|NH|4|+}}][{{chem|NH|2|-}}] = 10{{su|p=\u221230}}\n\n===Combustion===\nThe combustion of ammonia to nitrogen and water is [[exothermic]]:\n: 4 NH<sub>3</sub> + 3 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 N<sub>2</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O (''g'') [[Standard enthalpy of reaction|\u0394''H''\u00b0<sub>r</sub>]] = \u22121267.20 kJ/mol (or \u2212316.8 kJ/mol if expressed per mol of NH<sub>3</sub>)\n\nThe [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], \u0394''H''\u00b0<sub>c</sub>, expressed per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of ammonia and with condensation of the water formed, is \u2212382.81&nbsp;kJ/mol. Dinitrogen is the thermodynamic product of combustion: all [[nitrogen oxide]]s are unstable with respect to N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, which is the principle behind the [[catalytic converter]]. Nitrogen oxides can be formed as kinetic products in the presence of appropriate catalysts, a reaction of great industrial importance in the production of [[nitric acid]]:\n:4 NH<sub>3</sub> + 5 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 4 NO + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nA subsequent reaction leads to NO<sub>2</sub>\n\n:2 NO + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 NO<sub>2</sub>\n\nThe combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst (such as [[platinum]] gauze or warm [[chromium(III) oxide]]), because the temperature of the flame is usually lower than the ignition temperature of the ammonia\u2013air mixture. The flammable range of ammonia in air is 16\u201325%.<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw1st|page=485}}</ref>\n\n===Formation of other compounds===\nIn [[organic chemistry]], ammonia can act as a [[nucleophile]] in [[Nucleophilic substitution|substitution]] reactions. [[Amine]]s can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with [[alkyl halide]]s, although the resulting -NH<sub>2</sub> group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution and neutralises the [[hydrogen halide]] formed. [[Methylamine]] is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with [[chloromethane]], and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare [[racemic]] [[alanine]] in 70% yield. [[Ethanolamine]] is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with [[ethylene oxide]]: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce [[diethanolamine]] and [[triethanolamine]].\n\n[[Amide]]s can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives. [[Acyl chloride]]s are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the [[hydrogen chloride]] formed. [[Ester]]s and [[anhydride]]s also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be [[Dehydration|dehydrated]] to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150\u2013200&nbsp;\u00b0C are required.\n\nThe hydrogen in ammonia is capable of replacement by [[metal]]s; thus, [[magnesium]] burns in the gas with the formation of [[magnesium nitride]] Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, and when the gas is passed over heated [[sodium]] or [[potassium]], sodamide, NaNH<sub>2</sub>, and potassamide, KNH<sub>2</sub>, are formed.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}} Where necessary in [[IUPAC nomenclature|substitutive nomenclature]], [[IUPAC]] recommendations prefer the name \"azane\" to ammonia: hence [[chloramine]] would be named \"chloroazane\" in substitutive nomenclature, not \"chloroammonia\".\n\nPentavalent ammonia is known as \u03bb<sup>5</sup>-amine, or more commonly, ammonium hydride. This crystalline solid is only stable under high pressure and decomposes back into trivalent ammonia and hydrogen gas at normal conditions.

It is a pure \u03c3-donor, in the middle of the [[spectrochemical series]], and shows intermediate [[HSAB concept|hard-soft]] behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named '''ammine''' in the nomenclature of [[coordination compound]]s. Some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper(II) ([Cu(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>), a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to a solution of copper(II) salts. Tetraamminediaquacopper(II) hydroxide is known as [[Schweizer's reagent]], and has the remarkable ability to dissolve [[cellulose]]. Diamminesilver(I) ([Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>) is the active species in [[Tollens' reagent]]. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: [[silver chloride]] (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, [[silver bromide]] (AgBr) is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution, whereas [[silver iodide]] (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous ammonia.\n\nAmmine complexes of [[chromium]](III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of [[Alfred Werner]]'s revolutionary theory on the structure of coordination compounds. Werner noted only two isomers (''fac''- and ''mer''-) of the complex [CrCl<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] could be formed, and concluded the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the [[wikt:vertex|vertices]] of an [[octahedron]]. This proposal has since been confirmed by [[X-ray crystallography]].\n\nAn ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more acidic than a free ammonia molecule, although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare. One example is the [[Mercury(I) chloride|Calomel reaction]], where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble.\n:Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2 NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Hg + HgCl(NH<sub>2</sub>) + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\n==Detection and determination==\n{{about|section=true|detection in the laboratory|detection in astronomy|#In astronomy}}\n\n===Ammonia in solution===\n{{main|Ammonia solution}}\nAmmonia and ammonium salts can be readily detected, in very minute traces, by the addition of [[Nessler's solution]], which gives a distinct yellow colouration in the presence of the slightest trace of ammonia or ammonium salts.

Ammonia has sometimes been used to fill weather balloons as a [[lifting gas]]. Because of its relatively high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an [[airship]] to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast).\n\n====Woodworking====\n{{see also|Ammonia fuming}}\nAmmonia has been used to darken quartersawn white oak in Arts & Crafts and Mission-style furniture.

This is an efficient way to package hydrogen into a chemical that is much cheaper to store and transport than pure hydrogen be it as gas or as liquid. In fact, per volume ammonia holds more hydrogen than does liquid hydrogen.

Various renewable energy electricity sources are also potentially applicable.\n\nAs a sustainable alternative to the relatively inefficient [[electrolysis]], hydrogen can be generated from organic wastes (such as biomass or food-industry waste) using [[catalytic reforming]].

Catalytic (thermal) reforming is possible in small, distributed (even mobile) plants, to take advantage of low-value, stranded biomass/biowaste or natural gas deposits. Conversion of such wastes into ammonia solves the problem of hydrogen storage, as hydrogen can be released economically from ammonia on-demand, without the need for high-pressure or cryogenic storage.\n\nIt is also easier to store ammonia onboard vehicles than to store hydrogen, as ammonia is less flammable than petrol or LPG.\n\nFor small scale laboratory synthesis, one can heat [[urea]] and Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>\n\n:(NH2)<sub>2</sub>CO + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NH<sub>3</sub>\n\n==Liquid ammonia as a solvent==\n{{See also|Inorganic nonaqueous solvent}}\nLiquid ammonia is the best-known and most widely studied nonaqueous ionising solvent.

Intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation; the scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe<sub>7</sub>MoS<sub>9</sub> ensemble.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Igarashi|first1=Robert Y.|last2=Laryukhin|first2=Mikhail|last3=Dos Santos|first3=Patricia C.|last4=Lee|first4=Hong-In|last5=Dean|first5=Dennis R.|last6=Seefeldt|first6=Lance C.|last7=Hoffman|first7=Brian M.|title=Trapping H- Bound to the Nitrogenase FeMo-Cofactor Active Site during H2 Evolution: Characterization by ENDOR Spectroscopy|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=May 2005|volume=127|issue=17|pages=6231\u20136241|doi=10.1021/ja043596p}}</ref>\n\nAmmonia is also a metabolic product of [[amino acid]] [[deamination]] catalyzed by enzymes such as [[Glutamate dehydrogenase 1#Function|glutamate dehydrogenase 1]]. Ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals. In humans, it is quickly converted to [[urea]], which is much less toxic, particularly less [[#Basicity|basic]]. This urea is a major component of the dry weight of [[urine]]. Most reptiles, birds, insects, and snails excrete [[uric acid]] solely as nitrogenous waste.\n\n===In physiology===\nAmmonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal [[physiology]]. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The [[liver]] converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the [[urea cycle]]. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in [[cirrhosis]], may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood ([[hyperammonemia]]). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as [[ornithine transcarbamylase]], lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and [[coma]] of [[hepatic encephalopathy]], as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and [[organic aciduria]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Zschocke, Johannes |author2=Hoffman, Georg |title=Vademecum Metabolism|publisher= Schattauer Verlag|year= 2004|isbn=3794523857}}</ref>\n\nAmmonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from [[glutamine]], [[\u03b1-ketoglutarate]] may be degraded to produce two molecules of [[bicarbonate]], which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rose, Burton |author2=Helmut Rennke|title=Renal Pathophysiology|location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams & Wilkins|year= 1994|isbn=0-683-07354-0}}</ref>\n\n===Excretion===\n{{Main article|Excretion}}\nAmmonium ions are a [[Toxicity|toxic]] waste product of [[metabolism]] in [[animal]]s. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the [[urea cycle]] to [[urea]], because it is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into [[uric acid]], which is solid, and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss.<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil Campbell (scientist) |author2=[[Jane Reece|Jane B.

Moreover, since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures, this calculation is fairly simple. This premise can be applied to dark clouds, regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation. Detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines\u2014indicative not only of low temperatures, but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence. Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations. The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of ~10 K. With this, densities can be determined, and have been calculated to range between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>\u22123</sup> in dark clouds. Mapping of NH<sub>3</sub> gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1 [[Parsec|pc]] and masses near 1 solar mass. These cold, dense cores are the sites of future star formation.\n\n====UC HII regions====\nUltra-compact HII regions are among the best tracers of high-mass star formation. The dense material surrounding UCHII regions is likely primarily molecular. Since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed, ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material. Since this molecular material can be spatially resolved, it is possible to constrain the heating/ionising sources, temperatures, masses, and sizes of the regions.

There is one test based on \"Brazil law twinning\" (a form of [[Crystal twinning|quartz twinning]] where right and left hand quartz structures are combined in a single crystal<ref>{{cite web|url = http://quartzpage.de/crs_twins.html|title = Quartz Page Twinning Crystals|work=quartzpage.de}}</ref>) which can be used to identify synthetic amethyst rather easily.

On exposure to heat, the irradiation effects can be partially cancelled and amethyst generally becomes yellow or even green, and much of the [[citrine]], [[Cairngorm (mineral)|cairngorm]], or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely \"burnt amethyst\".<ref name=\"EB1911\"/><ref>{{cite book|author =Michael O'Donoghue|title=Synthetic, Imitation, and Treated Gemstones|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jm3FwBiHaI4C&pg=PA124|year=1997|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-7506-3173-0|pages=124\u2013125}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural history==\n\n===Ancient Greece===\nThe Greek word \"amethystos\" may be translated as \"not drunken\", from Greek ''a-'', \"not\" + ''methustos'', \"intoxicated\".<ref>{{OEtymD|amethyst}}</ref> Amethyst was considered to be a strong antidote against drunkenness,<ref>See, for example:\n*  The earliest reference to amethyst as a symbol of sobriety is in a poem by [[Asclepiades of Samos]] (born ~320&nbsp;BCE).

While ''Albertosaurus'' was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.\n\nSince the first discovery in 1884, [[fossil]]s of more than 30 individuals have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of ''Albertosaurus'' anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of [[pack hunter|pack]] behaviour and allows studies of [[ontogeny]] and [[population biology]], which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Albertosaurus.png|thumb|left|''Albertosaurus'' with a human for scale]]\n''Albertosaurus'' was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids, such as ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'' and ''Tyrannosaurus''.

The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are [[sister taxa]], more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that ''Albertosaurus'' and ''Gorgosaurus'' be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than ''Daspletosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'', which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from [[Alaska]] and [[New Mexico]], and Currie suggested that the ''Albertosaurus''-''Gorgosaurus'' situation may be clarified once these are described fully.<ref name=currie2003b/> Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation,<ref name=holtz2004/><ref name=ericksonetal2004/><ref name=ricklefs2007>{{cite_journal |last=Ricklefs |first=Robert E. |year=2007 |title=Tyrannosaur ageing |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=214\u2013217 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0597 |pmid=17284406 |pmc=2375931}}</ref> but some have not.<ref name=carretal2005/>\n\n===Other species===\nApart from ''A. sarcophagus'', ''A. arctunguis'' and ''A. libratus'', several other species of ''Albertosaurus'' have been named.

Using bone [[histology]], the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species. The youngest known ''Albertosaurus'' is a two-year-old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about 50 kilograms (110&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) and measured slightly more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} in length. The {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=off}} specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an ''S''-shaped growth curve results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The growth rate during this phase was {{convert|122|kg|lb|abbr=off}} per year, based on an adult 1.3&nbsp;[[tonne]]s.

It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of [[Biological life cycle|life history]], rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile ''Albertosaurus'' are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/>\n\nA hypothesis of ''Albertosaurus'' life history postulates that [[hatchling]]s died in large numbers, but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult ''Albertosaurus'', and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of [[senescence]]. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, [[African buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all ''Albertosaurus'' specimens are known from one locality.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/><ref name=ricklefs2007/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Erickson | first1 = Gregory M. | last2 = Currie | first2 = Philip J. | last3 = Inouye | first3 = Brian D. | last4 = Winn | first4 = Alice A. | year = 2010 | title = A revised life table and survivorship curve for ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' based on the Dry Island mass death assemblage | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1269\u20131275 | doi = 10.1139/e10-051 }}</ref>\n\n===Pack behaviour===\n[[Image:Albertosaurus Tyrrell.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze sculptures of a pack, RTM, designed by Brian Cooley in 2007]]\nThe Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the remains of 26 ''Albertosaurus'', the most individuals found in one locality of any large Cretaceous theropod, and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the ''[[Allosaurus]]'' assemblage at the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] in [[Utah]].

The leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of [[ornithomimid]]s, which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs.

Immediately below this formation is the [[Bearpaw Shale]], a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] formation representing a section of the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously been underwater. It was not a smooth process, however, and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like [[lagoon]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[tidal flat]]s. Numerous [[coal]] seams represent ancient [[peat]] [[swamp]]s.

Dinosaurs dominate the fauna, especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all dinosaurs known, including the genera ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', ''[[Saurolophus]]'' and ''[[Hypacrosaurus]]''. Ceratopsians and [[ornithomimid]]s were also very common, together making up another third of the known fauna.

The conversion process is referred to as ''assembly'', or ''assembling'' the [[source code]].\n\n==Assembler language syntax==\nAssembly language uses a [[mnemonic]] to represent each low-level [[machine code|machine instruction]] or [[opcode]], typically also each [[register (computing)#ARCHITECTURAL|architectural register]], [[bit field|flag]], etc. Many operations require one or more [[Operand#Computer science|operands]] in order to form a complete instruction. Most assemblers permit named constants, registers, and [[Label (computer science)|labels]] for program and memory locations, and can calculate [[Expression (computer science)|expressions]] for operands. Thus, the programmers are freed from tedious repetitive calculations and assembler programs are much more readable than machine code. Depending on the architecture, these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or [[addressing mode]]s using [[offset (computer science)|offset]]s or other data as well as fixed addresses. Many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, to control the assembly process, and to aid [[debugging]].\n\n==Terminology==\n* A '''macro assembler''' includes a [[macro (computer science)|macroinstruction]] facility so that (parameterized) assembly language text can be represented by a name, and that name can be used to insert the expanded text into other code.\n* {{anchor|Cross assembler}}A '''cross assembler''' (see also [[cross compiler]]) is an assembler that is run on a computer or [[operating system]] (the ''host'' system) of a different type from the system on which the resulting code is to run (the ''target system''). Cross-assembling facilitates the development of programs for systems that do not have the resources to support software development, such as an [[embedded system]]. In such a case, the resulting [[object code]] must be transferred to the target system, either via [[read-only memory]] (ROM, [[EPROM]], etc.) or a data link using an exact bit-by-bit copy of the object code or a text-based representation of that code, such as [[SREC (file format)|Motorola S-record]] or [[Intel HEX]].\n* A '''[[high-level assembler]]''' is a program that provides language abstractions more often associated with high-level languages, such as advanced control structures ([[If-then-else|IF/THEN/ELSE]], DO CASE, etc.) and high-level abstract data types, including structures/records, unions, classes, and sets.\n* A '''[[microassembler]]''' is a program that helps prepare a [[microcode|microprogram]], called ''firmware'', to control the low level operation of a computer.\n* A '''meta-assembler''' is a term used in some circles for ''\"a program that accepts the syntactic and semantic description of an assembly language, and generates an assembler for that language.\"''<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O11-metaassembler.html (John Daintith, ed.) A Dictionary of Computing: \"meta-assembler\"]</ref>\n* ''Assembly time'' is the computational step where an assembler is run.\n\n==Key concepts==\n===Assembler===<!-- This section is linked from [[Computer software]] -->\nAn '''assembler''' program creates [[object code]] by translating combinations of mnemonics and [[syntax]] for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents. This representation typically includes an ''operation code'' (\"[[opcode]]\") as well as other control [[bit]]s and data. The assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves [[identifier|symbolic names]] for memory locations and other entities.<ref name=\"Salomon\">David Salomon (1993). ''[http://www.davidsalomon.name/assem.advertis/asl.pdf Assemblers and Loaders]''</ref> The use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications. Most assemblers also include [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] facilities for performing textual substitution \u2013 e.g., to generate common short sequences of instructions as [[inline expansion|inline]], instead of ''called'' [[subroutine]]s.\n\nSome assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of [[instruction set]]-specific [[Compiler optimization|optimizations]]. One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous [[x86]] assemblers from various vendors. Most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any number of passes, on request. Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for [[RISC]] [[Instruction set architecture|architectures]] that can help optimize a sensible [[instruction scheduling]] to exploit the [[CPU pipeline]] as efficiently as possible.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nLike early programming languages such as [[Fortran]], [[ALGOL|Algol]], [[Cobol]] and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], assemblers have been available since the 1950s and the first generations of text based [[computer interface]]s. However, assemblers came first as they are far simpler to write than [[compiler]]s for [[high-level language]]s. This is because each mnemonic along with the addressing modes and operands of an instruction translates rather directly into the numeric representations of that particular instruction, without much context or analysis. There have also been several classes of translators and semi automatic [[code generator]]s with properties similar to both assembly and [[high level language]]s, with [[speedcode]] as perhaps one of the better known examples.\n\nThere may be several assemblers with different [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] for a particular [[Central processing unit|CPU]] or [[instruction set architecture]]. For instance, an instruction to add memory data to a register in a [[x86]]-family processor might be <code>add eax,[ebx]</code>, in original ''[[Intel syntax]]'', whereas this would be written <code>addl (%ebx),%eax</code> in the ''[[AT&T syntax]]'' used by the [[GNU Assembler]]. Despite different appearances, different syntactic forms generally generate the same numeric [[machine code]], see further below. A single assembler may also have different modes in order to support variations in syntactic forms as well as their exact semantic interpretations (such as [[FASM]]-syntax, [[TASM]]-syntax, ideal mode etc., in the special case of [[X86 assembly language|x86 assembly]] programming).\n\n==== {{Anchor|Two-pass assembler}} Number of passes====\nThere are two types of assemblers based on how many passes through the source are needed  (how many times the assembler reads the source) to produce the object file.\n* '''One-pass assemblers''' go through the source code once. Any symbol used before it is defined will require [[Erratum|\"errata\"]] at the end of the object code (or, at least, no earlier than the point where the symbol is defined) telling the [[linker (computing)|linker]] or the loader to \"go back\" and overwrite a placeholder which had been left where the as yet undefined symbol was used.\n* '''Multi-pass assemblers''' create a table with all symbols and their values in the first passes, then use the table in later passes to generate code.\nIn both cases, the assembler must be able to determine the size of each instruction on the initial passes in order to calculate the addresses of subsequent symbols. This means that if the size of an operation referring to an operand defined later depends on the type or distance of the operand, the assembler will make a pessimistic estimate when first encountering the operation, and if necessary pad it with one or more\n\"[[NOP (code)|no-operation]]\" instructions in a later pass or the errata. In an assembler with [[peephole optimization]], addresses may be recalculated between passes to allow replacing pessimistic code with code tailored to the exact distance from the target.\n\nThe original reason for the use of one-pass assemblers was speed of assembly \u2013 often a second pass would require rewinding and rereading the program source on [[Magnetic tape data storage|tape]] or rereading a deck of [[Punch cards|cards]] or [[Punched tape|punched paper tape]]. Later computers with much larger memories (especially disc storage), had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re-reading. The advantage of the multi-pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the [[Linker (computing)|linking process]] (or the [[Loader (computing)|program load]] if the assembler directly produces executable code) faster.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Leland L.|title=System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1996|chapter=2}}</ref>\n\n'''Example:''' in the following code snippet a one-pass assembler would be able to determine the address of the backward reference <var>BKWD</var> when assembling statement <var>S2</var>, but would not be able to determine the address of the forward reference <var>FWD</var> when assembling the branch statement <var>S1</var>; indeed <var>FWD</var> may be undefined.

The binary code for this instruction is 10110 followed by a 3-bit identifier for which register to use.

Assembly language for the 8086 family provides the [[mnemonic]] [[MOV (x86 instruction)|MOV]] (an abbreviation of ''move'') for instructions such as this, so the machine code above can be written as follows in assembly language, complete with an explanatory comment if required, after the semicolon. This is much easier to read and to remember.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"nasm\">MOV AL, 61h       ; Load AL with 97 decimal (61 hex)</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn some assembly languages the same mnemonic such as MOV may be used for a family of related instructions for loading, copying and moving data, whether these are immediate values, values in registers, or memory locations pointed to by values in registers.  Other assemblers may use separate opcode mnemonics such as L for \"move memory to register\", ST for \"move register to memory\", LR for \"move register to register\", MVI for \"move immediate operand to memory\", etc.\n\nThe x86 opcode 10110000 (<code>B0</code>) copies an 8-bit value into the ''AL'' register, while 10110001 (<code>B1</code>) moves it into ''CL'' and 10110010 (<code>B2</code>) does so into ''DL''.

Unlike [[high-level language]]s, there is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between many simple assembly statements and machine language instructions. However, in some cases, an assembler may provide ''pseudoinstructions'' (essentially macros) which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality. For example, for a machine that lacks a \"branch if greater or equal\" instruction, an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machine's \"set if less than\" and \"branch if zero (on the result of the set instruction)\". Most full-featured assemblers also provide a rich [[macro (computer science)|macro]] language (discussed below) which is used by vendors and programmers to generate more complex code and data sequences.\n\nEach [[computer architecture]] has its own machine language.  Computers differ in the number and type of operations they support, in the different sizes and numbers of registers, and in the representations of data in storage. While most general-purpose computers are able to carry out essentially the same functionality, the ways they do so differ; the corresponding assembly languages reflect these differences.\n\nMultiple sets of [[mnemonic]]s or assembly-language syntax may exist for a single instruction set, typically instantiated in different assembler programs. In these cases, the most popular one is usually that supplied by the manufacturer and used in its documentation.\n\n==Language design==\n\n===Basic elements===\nThere is a large degree of diversity in the way the authors of assemblers categorize statements and in the nomenclature that they use. In particular, some describe anything other than a machine mnemonic or extended mnemonic as a pseudo-operation (pseudo-op). A typical assembly language consists of 3 types of instruction statements that are used to define program operations:\n*[[Opcode]] mnemonics\n*Data definitions\n*Assembly directives\n\n====Opcode mnemonics and extended mnemonics====\nInstructions (statements) in assembly language are generally very simple, unlike those in [[high-level programming language|high-level languages]]. Generally, a mnemonic is a symbolic name for a single executable machine language instruction (an [[opcode]]), and there is at least one opcode mnemonic defined for each machine language instruction. Each instruction typically consists of an ''operation'' or ''opcode'' plus zero or more ''[[operand]]s''. Most instructions refer to a single value, or a pair of values.  Operands can be immediate (value coded in the instruction itself), registers specified in the instruction or implied, or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage. This is determined by the underlying processor architecture: the assembler merely reflects how this architecture works. ''Extended mnemonics'' are often used to specify a combination of an opcode with a specific operand, e.g., the System/360 assemblers use {{code|B}} as an extended mnemonic for {{code|BC}} with a mask of 15 and {{code|NOP}} (\"NO OPeration\" \u2013 do nothing for one step) for {{code|BC}} with a mask of 0.\n\n''Extended mnemonics'' are often used to support specialized uses of instructions, often for purposes not obvious from the instruction name. For example, many CPU's do not have an explicit NOP instruction, but do have instructions that can be used for the purpose. In 8086 CPUs the instruction {{code|2=asm|xchg ax,ax}} is used for {{code|nop}}, with {{code|nop}} being a pseudo-opcode to encode the instruction {{code|2=asm|xchg ax,ax}}. Some disassemblers recognize this and will decode the {{code|2=asm|xchg ax,ax}} instruction as {{code|nop}}. Similarly, IBM assemblers for [[IBM System/360|System/360]] and [[IBM System/370|System/370]] use the extended mnemonics {{code|NOP}} and {{code|NOPR}} for {{code|BC}} and {{code|BCR}} with zero masks.  For the SPARC architecture, these are known as ''synthetic instructions''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparc.com/standards/V8.pdf |publisher=SPARC, International |title=The SPARC Architecture Manual, Version 8 |year=1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210201410/http://www.sparc.com/standards/V8.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-10 }}</ref>\n\nSome assemblers also support simple built-in macro-instructions that generate two or more machine instructions. For instance, with some Z80 assemblers the instruction {{code|ld hl,bc}} is recognized to generate {{code|ld l,c}} followed by {{code|ld h,b}}.<ref>[http://www.z80.de/z80/z80code.htm Z80 Op Codes for ZINT]. Z80.de. Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref> These are sometimes known as ''pseudo-opcodes''.\n\nMnemonics are arbitrary symbols; in 1985 the [[IEEE]] published Standard 694 for a uniform set of mnemonics to be used by all assemblers. The standard has since been withdrawn.\n\n====Data directives====\nThere are instructions used to define data elements to hold data and variables.  They define the type of data, the length and the [[data structure alignment|alignment]] of data. These instructions can also define whether the data is available to outside programs (programs assembled separately) or only to the program in which the data section is defined. Some assemblers classify these as pseudo-ops.\n\n====Assembly directives====\n\nAssembly directives, also called pseudo-opcodes, pseudo-operations or pseudo-ops, are commands given to an assembler \"directing it to perform operations other than assembling instructions.\".<ref name=\"Salomon\"/> Directives affect how the assembler operates and \"may affect the object code, the symbol table, the listing file, and the values of internal assembler parameters.\"  Sometimes the term ''pseudo-opcode'' is reserved for directives that generate object code, such as those that generate data.<ref>{{cite web|last=Microsoft Corporation|title=MASM: Directives & Pseudo-Opcodes|url=http://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs422/doc/art-of-asm/pdf/CH08.PDF|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe names of pseudo-ops often start with a dot to distinguish them from machine instructions.  Pseudo-ops can make the assembly of the program dependent on parameters input by a programmer, so that one program can be assembled different ways, perhaps for different applications. Or, a pseudo-op can be used to manipulate presentation of a program to make it easier to read and maintain. Another common use of pseudo-ops is to reserve storage areas for run-time data and optionally initialize their contents to known values.\n\nSymbolic assemblers let programmers associate arbitrary names (''[[label (programming language)|label]]s'' or ''symbols'') with memory locations and various constants. Usually, every constant and variable is given a name so instructions can reference those locations by name, thus promoting [[self-documenting code]]. In executable code, the name of each subroutine is associated with its entry point, so any calls to a subroutine can use its name. Inside subroutines, [[GOTO]] destinations are given labels. Some assemblers support ''local symbols'' which are lexically distinct from normal symbols (e.g., the use of \"10$\" as a GOTO destination).\n\nSome assemblers, such as NASM, provide flexible symbol management, letting programmers manage different [[namespace]]s, automatically calculate offsets within [[data structure]]s, and assign labels that refer to literal values or the result of simple computations performed by the assembler. Labels can also be used to initialize constants and variables with relocatable addresses.\n\nAssembly languages, like most other computer languages, allow comments to be added to program [[source code]] that will be ignored during assembly. Judicious commenting is essential in assembly language programs, as the meaning and purpose of a sequence of binary machine instructions can be difficult to determine. The \"raw\" (uncommented) assembly language generated by compilers or disassemblers is quite difficult to read when changes must be made.\n\n===Macros===\nMany assemblers support ''predefined macros'', and others support ''programmer-defined'' (and repeatedly re-definable) macros involving sequences of text lines in which variables and constants are embedded. The macro definition is most commonly{{efn|In 7070 Autocoder, a macro definition is a 7070 macro generator program that the assembler calls; Autocoder provides special macros for macro generators to use.}} a mixture of assembler statements, e.g., directives, symbolic machine instructions, and templates for assembler statements. This sequence of text lines may include opcodes or directives. Once a macro has been defined its name may be used in place of a mnemonic. When the assembler processes such a statement, it replaces the statement with the text lines associated with that macro, then processes them as if they existed in the source code file (including, in some assemblers, expansion of any macros existing in the replacement text). Macros in this sense date to IBM [[autocoder]]s of the 1950s.<ref>{{cite book  |title=Users of 1401 Autocoder\n|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/1401/progs/autocoder/mod.11.ps}}</ref>\n<ref>\"The following minor restriction or limitation is in effect with regard to the use of 1401 Autocoder when coding macro nstructions ...\"</ref>\n\nIn assembly language, the term \"macro\" represents a more comprehensive concept than it does in some other contexts, such as in the [[C programming language]], where its #define directive typically is used to create short single line macros. Assembler macro instructions, like macros in [[PL/I]] and some other languages, can be lengthy \"programs\" by themselves, executed by interpretation by the assembler during assembly.\n\nSince macros can have 'short' names but expand to several or indeed many lines of code, they can be used to make assembly language programs appear to be far shorter, requiring fewer lines of source code, as with higher level languages. They can also be used to add higher levels of structure to assembly programs, optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameters and other similar features.\n\nMacro assemblers often allow macros to take [[parameter (computer science)|parameter]]s. Some assemblers include quite sophisticated macro languages, incorporating such high-level language elements as optional parameters, symbolic variables, conditionals, string manipulation, and arithmetic operations, all usable during the execution of a given macro, and allowing macros to save context or exchange information. Thus a macro might generate numerous assembly language instructions or data definitions, based on the macro arguments. This could be used to generate record-style data structures or \"unrolled\" loops, for example, or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters. For instance, a \"sort\" macro could accept the specification of a complex sort key and generate code crafted for that specific key, not needing the run-time tests that would be required  for a general procedure interpreting the specification. An organization using assembly language that has been heavily extended using such a macro suite can be considered to be working in a higher-level language, since such programmers are not working with a computer's lowest-level conceptual elements. Underlining this point, macros were used to implement an early [[virtual machine]] in [[SNOBOL4]] (1967), which was written in the SNOBOL Implementation Language (SIL), an assembly language for a virtual machine. The target machine would translate this to its native code using a [[macro assembler]].<ref>Griswold, Ralph E.  ''The Macro Implementation of SNOBOL4''.  San Francisco, CA: W. H. Freeman and Company, 1972 ({{ISBN|0-7167-0447-1}}), Chapter 1.</ref> This allowed a high degree of portability for the time.\n\nMacros were used to customize large scale software systems for specific customers in the mainframe era and were also used by customer personnel to satisfy their employers' needs by making specific versions of manufacturer operating systems. This was done, for example, by systems programmers working with [[IBM]]'s Conversational Monitor System / Virtual Machine ([[VM/CMS]]) and with IBM's \"real time transaction processing\" add-ons, Customer Information Control System [[CICS]], and [[Airline Control Program|ACP]]/[[Transaction Processing Facility|TPF]], the airline/financial system that began in the 1970s and still runs many large [[computer reservation system]]s (CRS) and credit card systems today.\n\nIt is also possible to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages, for example, to generate a version of a program in [[COBOL]] using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of COBOL code inside assembly time operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code. IBM [[OS/360]] uses macros to perform [[system generation]]. The user specifies options by coding a series of assembler macros.  Assembling these macros generates a [[job stream]] to build the system, including [[job control language]] and [[IBM mainframe utility programs|utility]] control statements.\n\nThis is because, as was realized in the 1960s, the concept of \"macro processing\" is independent of the concept of \"assembly\", the former being in modern terms more word processing, text processing, than generating object code. The concept of macro processing appeared, and appears, in the C programming language, which supports \"preprocessor instructions\" to set variables, and make conditional tests on their values. Note that unlike certain previous macro processors inside assemblers, the C preprocessor is not [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] because it lacks the ability to either loop or \"go to\", the latter allowing programs to loop.\n\nDespite the power of macro processing, it fell into disuse in many high level languages (major exceptions being [[C_(programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[PL/I]]) while remaining a perennial for assemblers.\n\nMacro parameter substitution is strictly by name: at macro processing time, the value of a parameter is textually substituted for its name. The most famous class of bugs resulting was the use of a parameter that itself was an expression and not a simple name when the macro writer expected a name. In the macro:\n\n foo: macro a\n load a*b\n\nthe intention was that the caller would provide the name of a variable, and the \"global\" variable or constant b would be used to multiply \"a\". If foo is called with the parameter <code>a-c</code>, the macro expansion of <code>load a-c*b</code> occurs.  To avoid any possible ambiguity, users of macro processors can parenthesize formal parameters inside macro definitions, or callers can parenthesize the input parameters.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/503x3e3s%28v=VS.90%29.aspx\n   |title=Macros (C/C++), MSDN Library for Visual Studio 2008\n   |publisher=Microsoft Corp.\n   |accessdate=2010-06-22\n}}</ref>\n\n===Support for structured programming===\nSome assemblers have incorporated [[structured programming]] elements to encode execution flow. The earliest example of this approach was in the [[Concept-14 macro set]], originally proposed by Dr. [[Harlan Mills]] (March 1970), and implemented by Marvin Kessler at IBM's Federal Systems Division, which extended the S/360 macro assembler with IF/ELSE/ENDIF and similar control flow blocks.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=http://skycoast.us/pscott/software/mvs/concept14.html\n   |title=Concept 14 Macros\n   |publisher=MVS Software\n   |accessdate=May 25, 2009\n}}</ref> This was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of [[GOTO]] operations in assembly code, one of the main factors causing [[spaghetti code]] in assembly language. This approach was widely accepted in the early '80s (the latter days of large-scale assembly language use).\n\nA curious design was [[A-natural]], a \"stream-oriented\" assembler for 8080/[[Z80]] processors{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} from [[Whitesmiths|Whitesmiths Ltd.]] (developers of the [[Unix]]-like [[Idris (operating system)|Idris]] operating system, and what was reported to be the first commercial [[C (programming language)|C]] [[compiler]]). The language was classified as an assembler, because it worked with raw machine elements such as [[opcodes]], [[processor register|registers]], and memory references; but it incorporated an expression syntax to indicate execution order. Parentheses and other special symbols, along with block-oriented structured programming constructs, controlled the sequence of the generated instructions. A-natural was built as the object language of a C compiler, rather than for hand-coding, but its logical syntax won some fans.\n\nThere has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemblers since the decline of large-scale assembly language development.<ref name=\"assembly-language?cat=technology\">{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/assembly-language?cat=technology|title=assembly language: Definition and Much More from Answers.com|accessdate=2008-06-19|author=Answers.com}}</ref> In spite of that, they are still being developed and applied in cases where resource constraints or peculiarities in the target system's architecture prevent the effective use of higher-level languages.<ref>{{cite web |last=Provinciano |first=Brian |url=http://neshla.sourceforge.net/ |title=NESHLA: The High Level, Open Source, 6502 Assembler for the Nintendo Entertainment System}}</ref>\n\nAssemblers with a strong macro engine allow structured programming via macros, such as the switch macro provided with the Masm32 package (note this code is a complete program):\n\n<source lang=\"nasm\">\ninclude \\masm32\\include\\masm32rt.inc\t; use the Masm32 library\n\n.code\ndemomain:\n  REPEAT 20\n\tswitch rv(nrandom, 9)\t; generate a number between 0 and 8\n\tmov ecx, 7\n\tcase 0\n\t\tprint \"case 0\"\n\tcase ecx\t\t\t\t; in contrast to most other programming languages,\n\t\tprint \"case 7\"\t\t; the Masm32 switch allows \"variable cases\"\n\tcase 1 .. 3\n\t\t.if eax==1\n\t\t\tprint \"case 1\"\n\t\t.elseif eax==2\n\t\t\tprint \"case 2\"\n\t\t.else\n\t\t\tprint \"cases 1 to 3: other\"\n\t\t.endif\n\tcase 4, 6, 8\n\t\tprint \"cases 4, 6 or 8\"\n\tdefault\n\t\tmov ebx, 19\t\t     ; print 20 stars\n\t\t.Repeat\n\t\t\tprint \"*\"\n\t\t\tdec ebx\n\t\t.Until Sign?\t\t ; loop until the sign flag is set\n\tendsw\n\tprint chr$(13, 10)\n  ENDM\n  exit\nend demomain\n</source>\n\n==Use of assembly language==\n\n===Historical perspective===\n\nAssembly languages date to the introduction of the [[stored-program computer]].

They were once widely used for all sorts of programming. However, by the 1980s (1990s on [[microcomputer]]s), their use had largely been supplanted by higher-level languages, in the search for improved [[programming productivity]]. Today assembly language is still used for direct hardware manipulation, access to specialized processor instructions, or to address critical performance issues. Typical uses are [[device driver]]s, low-level [[embedded system]]s, and [[real-time computing|real-time]] systems.\n\nHistorically, numerous programs have been written entirely in assembly language. The [[Burroughs MCP]] (1961) was the first computer for which an operating system was not developed entirely in assembly language; it was written in [[Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language]] (ESPOL), an Algol dialect. Many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well, including a large amount of the [[IBM mainframe]] software written by large corporations. [[COBOL]], [[FORTRAN]] and some [[PL/I]] eventually displaced much of this work, although a number of large organizations retained assembly-language application infrastructures well into the 1990s.\n\nMost early microcomputers relied on hand-coded assembly language, including most operating systems and large applications. This was because these systems had severe resource constraints, imposed idiosyncratic memory and display architectures, and provided limited, buggy system services. Perhaps more important was the lack of first-class high-level language compilers suitable for microcomputer use. A psychological factor may have also played a role: the first generation of microcomputer programmers retained a hobbyist, \"wires and pliers\" attitude.\n\nIn a more commercial context, the biggest reasons for using assembly language were minimal bloat (size), minimal overhead, greater speed, and reliability.\n\nTypical examples of large assembly language programs from this time are IBM PC [[DOS]] operating systems, the [[Turbo Pascal]] compiler and early applications such as the [[spreadsheet]] program [[Lotus 1-2-3]]. According to some{{Who|date=November 2014}} industry insiders, the assembly language was the best computer language to use to get the best performance out of the [[Sega Saturn]], a console that was notoriously challenging to develop and program games for.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eidolons-inn.net/tiki-index.php?page=SegaBase+Saturn |title=Eidolon's Inn: SegaBase Saturn<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713074116/http://www.eidolons-inn.net/tiki-index.php?page=SegaBase+Saturn |archive-date=2008-07-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> The 1993 arcade game ''[[NBA Jam (1993 video game)|NBA Jam]]'' is another example.\n\nAssembly language has long been the primary development language for many popular home computers of the 1980s and 1990s (such as the [[MSX]],  [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]] [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Amiga]], and [[Atari ST]]). This was in large part because [[Interpreted language|interpreted]] BASIC dialects on these systems offered insufficient execution speed, as well as insufficient facilities to take full advantage of the available hardware on these systems. Some systems even have an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) with highly advanced debugging and macro facilities. Some compilers available for the [[Radio Shack]] [[TRS-80]] and its successors had the capability to combine inline assembly source with high-level program statements. Upon compilation a built-in assembler produced inline machine code.\n\n===Current usage===\nThere have always been debates over the usefulness and performance of assembly language relative to high-level languages. Assembly language has specific niche uses where it is important; see below. {{As of|2017|07}}, the [[TIOBE index]] of programming language popularity ranks assembly language at 11, ahead of [[Visual Basic]], for example.<ref name=\"tiobe\">{{cite news|url=http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index |title=TIOBE Index|publisher=TIOBE Software}}</ref> Assembler can be used to optimize for speed or optimize for size.

This has made raw code execution speed a non-issue for many programmers.\n\nThere are some situations in which developers might choose to use assembly language:\n* A stand-alone executable of compact size is required that must execute without recourse to the [[Run-time system|run-time]] components or [[library (computing)|libraries]] associated with a high-level language; this is perhaps the most common situation. For example, firmware for telephones, automobile fuel and ignition systems, air-conditioning control systems, security systems, and sensors.\n* Code that must interact directly with the hardware, for example in [[device driver]]s and [[interrupt handler]]s.\n* In an embedded processor or DSP, high-repetition interrupts require the shortest number of cycles per interrupt, such as an interrupt that occurs 1000 or 10000 times a second.\n* Programs that need to use processor-specific instructions not implemented in a compiler. A common example is the [[circular shift|bitwise rotation]] instruction at the core of many encryption algorithms, as well as querying the parity of a byte or the 4-bit carry of an addition.\n* Programs that create vectorized functions for programs in higher-level languages such as C.  In the higher-level language this is sometimes aided by compiler [[intrinsic function]]s which map directly to SIMD mnemonics, but nevertheless result in a one-to-one assembly conversion specific for the given vector processor.\n* Programs requiring extreme optimization, for example an inner [[Program loop|loop]] in a processor-intensive algorithm.

Although few programmers today regularly work with assembly language as a tool, the underlying concepts remain very important. Such fundamental topics as [[binary arithmetic]], [[memory allocation]], [[stack (data structure)|stack processing]], [[character set]] encoding, [[interrupt]] processing, and [[compiler]] design would be hard to study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level. Since a computer's behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set, the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language. Most modern computers have similar instruction sets. Therefore, studying a single assembly language is sufficient to learn: I) the basic concepts; II) to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate; and III) to see how efficient executable code can be created from high-level languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/books/artofasm/fwd.html|title=Foreword (\"Why would anyone learn this stuff?\"), ''op. cit.''|date=1996-09-30|accessdate=2010-03-05|author=Hyde, Randall|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325155048/http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/books/artofasm/fwd.html|archivedate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref> This is analogous to children needing to learn the basic arithmetic operations (e.g., long division), although [[calculator]]s are widely used for all except the most trivial calculations.\n'''\n\n===Typical applications===\n\n*Assembly language is typically used in a system's [[Booting|boot]] code, the low-level code that initializes and tests the system hardware prior to booting the operating system and is often stored in [[Read-only memory|ROM]].  ([[BIOS]] on IBM-compatible [[Personal Computer|PC]] systems and [[CP/M]] is an example.)\n*Some compilers translate high-level languages into assembly first before fully compiling, allowing the assembly code to be viewed for [[debug]]ging and optimization purposes.\n*Some compilers for relatively low-level languages, such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] or [[C (programming language)|C]], allow the programmer to embed assembly language directly in the source code. Programs using such facilities can then construct abstractions using different assembly language on each hardware platform. The system's [[software portability|portable]] code can then use these processor-specific components through a uniform interface.\n*Assembly language is useful in [[reverse engineering]]. Many programs are distributed only in machine code form which is straightforward to translate into assembly language, but more difficult to translate into a higher-level language. Tools such as the [[Interactive Disassembler]] make extensive use of disassembly for such a purpose. This technique is used by hackers to crack commercial software, and competitors to produce software with similar results from competing companies.\n*Assembly language is used to enhance speed of execution, especially in early Personal Computers with limited processing power and RAM.\n*Assemblers can be used to generate blocks of data, with no high-level language overhead, from formatted and commented source code, to be used by other code.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Computer programming|Computer science}}\n* [[Compiler]]\n* [[Comparison of assemblers]]\n* [[Disassembler]]\n* [[Data segment]]\n* [[Hexadecimal]]\n* [[Nibble]]\n* [[High Level Assembly]]\n* [[Instruction set]]\n* [[Spaghetti code]]\n* [[Little man computer]] \u2013 an educational computer model with a base-10 assembly language\n* [[Typed assembly language]]\n* [[WebAssembly]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130602003436/http://www.asmcommunity.net/book/ ''ASM Community Book''] \"An online book full of helpful ASM info, tutorials and code examples\" by the ASM Community, archived at the internet archive.\n* Jonathan Bartlett: ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708061040/http://programminggroundup.blogspot.com/ Programming from the Ground Up]''.

The two terms may not have originally been distinguished;<ref>\"Attempts to draw any significant distinctions between the functions of nectar and ambrosia have failed.\" Clay, p. 114.</ref> though in [[Homer]]'s poems nectar is usually the drink and ambrosia the food of the gods; it was with ambrosia Hera \"cleansed all defilement from her lovely flesh\",<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' xiv.170</ref> and with ambrosia Athena prepared [[Penelope]] in her sleep,<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' xviii.188ff</ref> so that when she appeared for the final time before her suitors, the effects of years had been stripped away, and they were inflamed with passion at the sight of her. On the other hand, in [[Alcman]],<ref>[[Alcman]], fragment 42</ref> nectar is the food, and in [[Sappho]]<ref>[[Sappho]], fragment 141 LP</ref> and [[Anaxandrides]], ambrosia is the drink.<ref>When Anaxandrides says \"I eat nectar and drink ambrosia\", though, Wright, p. 5, suggested he was using comic inversion.</ref> A character in [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Knights|Knights]]'' says, \"I dreamed the goddess poured ambrosia over your head\u2014out of a ladle.\" Both descriptions could be correct, as ambrosia could be a liquid considered a food (such as [[honey]]).\n\nThe consumption of ambrosia was typically reserved for divine beings. Upon his assumption into immortality on Olympus, [[Heracles]] is given ambrosia by [[Athena]], while the hero [[Tydeus]] is denied the same thing when the goddess discovers him eating human brains. In one version of the myth of [[Tantalus]], part of Tantalus' crime is that after tasting ambrosia himself, he attempts to steal some away to give to other mortals.<ref>[[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' 1. 50. ff.</ref> Those who consume ambrosia typically had not blood in their veins, but [[ichor]] the blood of immortals.<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' v. 340, 416.</ref>\n\nBoth nectar and ambrosia are fragrant, and may be used as [[perfume]]: in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' Menelaus and his men are disguised as seals in untanned seal skins, \"and the deadly smell of the seal skins vexed us sore; but the goddess saved us; she brought ambrosia and put it under our nostrils.\"<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv.444\u201346</ref> Homer speaks of ambrosial raiment, ambrosial locks of hair, even the gods' ambrosial sandals.\n\nAmong later writers, ''ambrosia'' has been so often used with generic meanings of \"delightful liquid\" that such late writers as [[Athenaeus]], [[Saint Paul|Paul]]us and [[Dioscurides]] employ it as a technical terms in contexts of cookery,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">In Athenaeus, a sauce of oil, water and fruit juice.</ref> medicine,<ref name=\"In Paulus, a medicinal draught\">In Paulus, a medicinal draught.</ref> and botany.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Dioscurides remarked its Latin name was ''ros marinus'', \"sea-dew\", or [[rosemary]]; these uses were noted by Wright 1917:6.</ref> [[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny]] used the term in connection with different plants, as did early herbalists.<ref name=Chambers>\"Ambrosia\" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclop\u00e6dia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 315.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, some modern [[Ethnomycology|ethnomycologists]], such as [[Danny Staples]], identify ambrosia with the [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'': \"it was the food of the gods, their ambrosia, and nectar was the pressed sap of its juices\", Staples asserts.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Carl A.P. Ruck and Danny Staples, ''The World of Classical Myth'' 1994:26.</ref>\n\n[[W. H. Roscher]] thinks that both nectar and ambrosia were kinds of [[honey]], in which case their power of conferring immortality would be due to the supposed healing and cleansing powers of honey,<ref name=EB1911/> which is in fact anti-septic, and because fermented honey ([[mead]]) preceded [[wine]] as an [[entheogen]] in the Aegean world; on some Minoan seals, goddesses were represented with [[bee]] faces (compare [[Merope (Pleiades)|Merope]] and [[Melissa]]).\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe concept of an immortality drink is attested in at least two [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] areas: Greek and [[Sanskrit]]. The Greek \u1f00\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 (''ambrosia'') is semantically linked to the Sanskrit {{lang-sa2|\u0905\u092e\u0943\u0924}} (''[[am\u1e5bta]]'') as both words denote a drink or food that gods use to achieve immortality. The two words appear to be derived from the same Indo-European form *''\u1e47-m\u1e5b-t\u00f3s'', \"un-dying\"<ref name=\"eiec\">{{Cite encyclopedia |first=J. P. |last1=Mallory |editor-first1=J.

A semantically similar etymology exists for [[Nectar#Etymology|nectar]], the beverage of the gods (Greek: \u03bd\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1 ''n\u00e9ktar'') presumed to be a compound of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] roots ''*nek-'', \"death\", and ''-*tar'', \"overcoming\".\n\n== Other examples in mythology ==\n[[File:Johann Balthasar Probst 002.jpg|thumb|Thetis anoints Achilles with ambrosia, by [[Johann Balthasar Probst]] (1673\u20131748)]]\n*In one version of the story of the birth of [[Achilles]], [[Thetis]] anoints the infant with ambrosia and passes the child through the fire to make him immortal but [[Peleus]], appalled, stops her, leaving only his heel unimmortalised (''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869-879).\n*In the ''[[Iliad]]'' xvi, [[Apollo]] washes the black blood from the corpse of [[Sarpedon]] and anoints it with ambrosia, readying it for its dreamlike return to Sarpedon's native [[Lycia]]. Similarly, [[Thetis]] anoints the corpse of [[Patroclus]] in order to preserve it. Additionally, both ambrosia and nectar are depicted as [[unguent]]s (xiv. 170; xix. 38).\n*In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] is described as having \"spread a table with ambrosia and set it by [[Hermes]], and mixed the rosy-red nectar.\"  It is ambiguous whether he means the ambrosia itself is rosy-red, or if he is describing a rosy-red nectar Hermes drinks along with the ambrosia.  Later, [[Circe]] mentions to [[Odysseus]]<ref>''Odyssey'' xii.62: \"the trembling doves that carry ambrosia to Father Zeus.\"</ref> that a flock of doves are the bringers of ambrosia to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].\n*In the ''Odyssey'' (ix.345&ndash;359), [[Polyphemus]] likens the wine given to him by [[Odysseus]] to ambrosia and nectar.\n*One of the impieties of [[Tantalus]], according to [[Pindar]], was that he offered to his guests the ambrosia of the Deathless Ones, a theft akin to that of [[Prometheus]], [[Karl Kerenyi]] noted (in ''Heroes of the Greeks''){{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.\n*In the [[Homeric hymn]] to [[Aphrodite]], the goddess uses \"ambrosial bridal oil that she had ready perfumed.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=West|first1=Martin L.|title=Homeric hymns; Homeric apocrypha; Lives of Homer|date=2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780674996069}}</ref>\n*In the story of ''[[Cupid and Psyche]]'' as told by [[Apuleius]], Psyche is given ambrosia upon her completion of the quests set by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and her acceptance on Olympus.

Ambrose was a staunch opponent of [[Arianism]].\n\nAmbrose was one of the four original [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]], and is the [[patron saint]] of Milan. He is notable for his influence on [[Augustine of Hippo]].\n\nTraditionally, Ambrose is credited with promoting \"antiphonal chant\", a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other, as well as with composing ''[[Veni redemptor gentium]]'', an [[Advent]] hymn.\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nAmbrose was born into a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Christian]] family about 340 and was raised in [[Gallia Belgica]], the capital of which was [[Trier|Augusta Treverorum]].<ref name=\"CE\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01383c.htm Loughlin, James. \"St. Ambrose.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 1.

His father considered this a [[Christian symbolism|sign]] of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue. For this reason, bees and [[beehive]]s often appear in the [[saint symbolism|saint's symbology]].\n\nAfter the early death of his father, Ambrose went to Rome, where he studied [[literature]], [[law]], and [[rhetoric]]. He then followed in his father's footsteps and entered public service. [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy|Praetorian Prefect]] [[Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus]] first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him governor of Liguria and Emilia, with headquarters at Milan.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}} In 286 Diocletian had moved the capital of the Western Roman Empire from Rome to Mediolanum (Milan).\n\nAmbrose was the Governor of Aemilia-Liguria in northern Italy until 374, when he became the Bishop of Milan. He was a very popular political figure, and since he was the Governor in the effective capital in the Roman West, he was a recognizable figure in the court of [[Valentinian I]].\n\n=== Bishop of Milan ===\nIn the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the [[diocese of Milan]] between the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene Church]] and [[Arianism|Arians]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Wilken | title = The Spirit of Early Christian Thought | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2003 | page = 218}}</ref>{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 407}} In 374 [[Auxentius of Milan|the bishop of Milan, Auxentius]], an Arian, died, and the Arians challenged the [[Apostolic succession|succession]].

His address was interrupted by a call, \"Ambrose, bishop!\", which was taken up by the whole assembly.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 407}}\n\nAmbrose was known to be Nicene Christian in belief, but also acceptable to Arians due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard. At first he energetically refused the office, for which he was in no way prepared: Ambrose was neither baptized nor formally trained in [[theology]].{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}} Upon his appointment, Ambrose fled to a colleague's home seeking to hide. Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor [[Gratianus|Gratian]] praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions, Ambrose's host gave him up. Within a week, he was baptized, ordained and duly consecrated bishop of [[Milan]].\n\nAs bishop, he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apportioned his money to the poor, donating all of his land, making only provision for his sister [[Saint Marcellina|Marcellina]] (who had become a nun). This raised his popularity even further, giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor. Upon the unexpected appointment of Ambrose to the episcopate, his brother Satyrus resigned a prefecture in order to move to Milan, where he took over managing the family's affairs.<ref name = \"CE\" />\n\n=== Arianism ===\n[[File:Museo del Duomo - Milan - St Ambrose of Milan - Unknown Lombard author (early 17 century).jpg|thumb|Statue of Saint Ambrose with a scourge in Museo del Duomo, Milan.

The Arians appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires. Although the western Emperor [[Gratian]] supported orthodoxy, the younger [[Valentinian II]], who became his colleague in the Empire, adhered to the Arian creed.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose did not sway the young prince's position. In the East, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] likewise professed the Nicene creed; but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions,{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=798}} especially among the higher clergy.\n\nIn this contested state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, bishops [[Palladius of Ratiaria]] and Secundianus of [[Singidunum]], confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire. This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation. However, Ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops. Accordingly, a [[Council of Aquileia, 381|synod]] composed of thirty-two bishops was held at [[Aquileia]] in the year 381. Ambrose was elected president and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined. A vote was then taken, when Palladius and his associate Secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=798}}\n\nNevertheless, the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose. In 385{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} or 386 the emperor and his mother [[Justina (empress)|Justina]], along with a considerable number of [[clergy]] and [[laity]], especially military, professed Arianism. They demanded two churches in [[Milan]], one in the city (the [[Basilica]] of the Apostles), the other in the suburbs (St Victor's), be allocated to the Arians.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} He went, his eloquence in defense of the Church reportedly overawing the ministers of Valentinian, so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day following, when he was performing [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine service]] in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs. As he still refused, certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the Portian basilica, by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons{{sfn|Butler|1991|p=408}} to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of [[Easter]].{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n\nIn spite of Imperial opposition, Ambrose declared, \"If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of Christ.

The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period. But it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n\nIt was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times; and he introduced popular reforms in the order and manner of public worship. It is alleged, too, that at a time when the influence of Ambrose required vigorous support, he was admonished in a dream to search for, and found under the pavement of the church, the remains of two [[martyr]]s, Gervasius and Protasius. The saints, although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old, looked as if they had just died. The applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n\n== Theology ==\nAmbrose ranks with [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Jerome]], and [[Gregory the Great]], as one of the [[Latin]] [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]].

He succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of [[Biblical]] and [[doctrinal]] subjects.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n\nAmbrose's intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing [[doctrine]] of the Church and its [[sacerdotal]] ministry, while the prevalent [[asceticism]] of the day, continuing the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Cicero]]nian training of his youth, enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of Christian [[ethics]]. Thus we have the ''De officiis ministrorum'', ''De viduis'', ''De virginitate'' and ''De paenitentia''.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n\nAmbrose displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping God, and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place. His advice to Augustine of Hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom. \"When I am at Rome, I fast on a Saturday; when I am at Milan, I do not.

His advice has remained in the English language as the saying, \"[[wikt:when in Rome, do as the Romans do|When in Rome, do as the Romans do.]]\"\n\nOne interpretation of Ambrose's writings is that he was a [[Christian universalism|Christian universalist]].<ref name=\"hanson\">{{Citation | first = JW | last = Hanson | title = Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine of The Christian Church During Its First Five Hundred Years | url = http://hellbusters.8m.com/upd18.html | chapter = 18.

''Confessions'' Book Six, Chapter Three.</ref>\n\n=== Reading ===\nIn this same passage of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' is an anecdote which bears on the history of reading:\n{{quote |When [Ambrose] read, his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still. Anyone could approach him freely and guests were not commonly announced, so that often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence, for he never read aloud.<ref name=\"AugustineOnAmbrose\" />}}\n\nThis is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion. The practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become. In a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds, in which the production of books was very labor-intensive, the majority of the population was illiterate, and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them, written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection. However, there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview27 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Read my lips | first=James | last=Fenton | date=July 28, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first =\nAK | last = Gavrilov | url = https://www.jstor.org/pss/639597 | title = Techniques of Reading in Classical Antiquity | journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 47 | year = 1997 | pages = 56\u201373, esp. 70\u201371 | doi=10.1093/cq/47.1.56}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = MF | last = Burnyeat | url = https://www.jstor.org/pss/639598 | title = Postscript on silent reading | journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 47 | year = 1997 | pages = 74\u201376 | doi=10.1093/cq/47.1.74}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Latin'''\n* ''Hexameron, De paradiso, De Cain, De Noe, De Abraham, De Isaac, De bono mortis''&nbsp;\u2013 ed.

The early policy of Ambracia was determined by its loyalty to Corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the [[Epirus]] trade), and its consequent aversion to [[Corcyra]] (as Ambracia participated on the Corinthian side at the [[Battle of Sybota]], which took place in 433 BC between the rebellious Corinthian colony of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]).{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}\n\nAmbraciot politics featured many frontier disputes with the [[Amphilochians]] and [[Acarnanians]].  Hence it took a prominent part in the [[Peloponnesian War]] until the crushing defeat at [[Idomene]] (426), which crippled its resources.{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}\n\nIn the 4th century BC it continued its traditional policy, but in 338 was besieged by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. With the assistance of Corinth and Athens, it escaped complete domination at Philip's hands, but was nevertheless forced to accept a Macedonian garrison.<ref name=\"OCD\"/>  In 294 BC, after forty-three years of semi-autonomy under [[Macedon]]ian suzerainty, Ambracia was given by the son of [[Cassander]] to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], who made it his capital, and adorned it with palace, temples and theatres.  In the wars of [[Philip V of Macedon]] and the Epirotes against the [[Aetolian League]] (220\u2013205) Ambracia passed from one alliance to the other, but ultimately joined the latter confederacy.  During the struggle of the Aetolians against [[Roman Republic|Rome]], it stood a stubborn [[siege]],{{sfn|Caspari|1911}} including the first known use of [[poison gas]] against the Romans' [[Tunnel warfare|siege tunnels]].<ref>[[Polybius]] 21.28</ref>\n\nAmbracia was captured and plundered by [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)|Marcus Fulvius Nobilior]] in 189 BC, after which it was declared by Rome a \"free city\", and gradually fell into insignificance.<ref name=\"OCD\"/>{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}  The foundation by [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] of [[Nicopolis]], into which the remaining inhabitants were drafted, left the site desolate.

The word was adopted in [[Middle English]] in the 14th century as referring to what is now known as ''[[ambergris]]'' (''ambre gris'' or \"grey amber\"), a solid waxy substance derived from the [[sperm whale]]. \nIn the [[Romance languages]], the sense of the word had come to be extended to Baltic amber (fossil resin) from as early as the late 13th century.

King Theoderic of the Ostrogoths sent an army, led by his sword-bearer [[Theudis]], against Gesalec, ostensibly on behalf of Amalaric; Gesalec fled to Africa. The Ostrogoths then drove back the Franks and their [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] allies, regaining possession of \"the south of [[Novempopulana]], [[Rodez]], probably even [[Albi]], and even Toulose\". Following the 511 death of Clovis, Theoderic negotiated a peace with Clovis' successors, securing Visigothic control of the southernmost portion of Gaul for the rest of the existence of their kingdom.<ref>Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', p. 245</ref>\n\nIn 522 the young Amalaric was proclaimed king, and four years later, on Theoderic's death, he assumed full royal power, although relinquishing Provence to his cousin [[Athalaric]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His kingdom was faced with a threat from the north from the Franks; according to Peter Heather, this was his motivation for marrying [[Clotilde (died 531)|Chrotilda]], the daughter of Clovis.<ref name=Heather-277>Peter Heather, ''The Goths'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 277</ref> However, this was not successful, for according to [[Gregory of Tours]], Amalaric pressured her to forsake her [[Roman Catholic]] faith and convert to [[Arianism|Arian Christianity]], at one point beating her until she bled; she sent to her brother [[Childebert I]], king of [[Paris]] a towel stained with her own blood.<ref name=Gregory-10>Gregory of Tours, ''Decem Libri Historiarum'', III.10; translated by Lewis Thorpe, ''History of the Franks'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974), pp. 170f.</ref> It is worth noting Ian Wood's advice that although Gregory provides the fullest information for this period, where it touches Merovingian affairs, he often \"allowed his religious bias to determine his interpretation of the events.\"<ref>Wood, ''The Merovingian Kingdoms: 450-751'' (London: Longman, 1994), p. 171</ref> Peter Heather agrees with Wood's implication in this instance: \"I doubt that this is the full story, but the effects of Frankish intervention are clear enough.\"<ref name=Heather-277/>\n\nChildebert defeated the Visigothic army and took [[Narbonne]].

It is used by mountain dwellers in the [[Swiss Alps]], [[Austria|Austrian Alps]], [[Bavarian Alps]] in [[Germany]], [[French Alps]], and elsewhere. Similar wooden horns were used for [[communication]] in most mountainous regions of [[Europe]], from the [[Alps]] to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. Alphorns are today used as musical instruments.\n\n== History ==\nFor a long time, scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the Roman-Etruscan [[lituus]], because of their resemblance in shape, and because of the word ''liti'', meaning Alphorn in the dialect of [[Obwalden]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} There is no documented evidence for this theory, however, and, the word ''liti'' was probably borrowed from 16th\u201318th century writings in Latin, where the word ''lituus'' could describe various wind instruments, such as the [[natural horn|horn]], the [[crumhorn]], or the [[cornett]].{{Clarify|date=June 2015}}<!--Does this mean that the dialect name \"liti\" is not found until after the 18th century, or that it goes back much further? If the latter, were these Latin writings from three centuries unanimous in using the lituus for all three of these instrument types and, further, does this mean the crumhorn was actually still in use in the 18th century?--> Swiss naturalist [[Conrad Gesner]] used the words ''lituum alpinum'' for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his ''De raris et admirandis herbis'' in 1555. The oldest known document using the German word ''Alphorn'' is a page from a 1527 account book from the former [[Cistercian]] abbey St. Urban near [[Pfaffnau]] mentioning the payment of two [[Batzen]] for an itinerant alphorn player from the [[Valais]].\n\n17th\u201319th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn-like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since medieval times or earlier, sometimes substituting for the lack of [[church bells]]. Surviving artifacts, dating back to as far as ca. AD 1400, include wooden [[Brass instrument|labrophones]] in their stretched form, like the alphorn, or coiled versions, such as the \"B\u00fcchel\" and the \"Allg\u00e4uisches Waldhorn\" or \"Ackerhorn\". The alphorn's exact origins remain indeterminate, and the ubiquity of horn-like signal instruments in valleys throughout Europe may indicate a long history of cross influences regarding their construction and usage.\n\n==Construction and qualities==\n[[Image:Alphorn player in Wallis.jpg|thumb|right|A Swiss playing alphorn]]\n\nThe alphorn is carved from solid [[softwood]], generally spruce but sometimes pine. In former times the alphorn maker would find a tree bent at the base in the shape of an alphorn, but modern makers piece the wood together at the base. A cup-shaped mouthpiece carved out of a block of hard wood is added and the instrument is complete.\n\nAn alphorn made at Rigi-Kulm, Schwyz, and now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], measures {{convert|8|ft|m}} in length and has a straight tube. The Swiss alphorn varies in shape according to the locality, being curved near the bell in the Bernese Oberland. [[Michael Praetorius]] mentions an alphorn-like instrument under the name of H\u00f6lzern Trummet (wooden trumpet) in ''Syntagma Musicum'' (Wittenberg, 1615\u20131619; Pl. VIII).<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alpenhorn, Alphorn|volume=1|page=723|first=Kathleen|last=Schlesinger|authorlink=Kathleen Schlesinger}}</ref>\n\nThe alphorn has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure [[Harmonic series (music)|natural harmonic series]] of the open pipe.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The notes of the natural harmonic series overlap, but do not exactly correspond, to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard Western [[equal temperament]]. Most prominently within the alphorn's range, the 7th and 11th harmonics are particularly noticeable, because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale.\n[[Image:Harmonic Series.png|thumb|center|600px]]\n\nAccomplished alphornists often command a range of nearly three octaves, consisting of the 2nd through the 16th notes of the harmonic series. The availability of the higher tones is due in part to the relatively small diameter of the bore of the mouthpiece and tubing in relation to the overall length of the horn.\n\n[[Image:Alphorn-MJ.jpg|thumb|right|D'Die\u00df'ner alphorn players.]]\nThe well-known \"[[Ranz des Vaches]]\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/19980214205945/http://www.lyoba.ch/culture/desalpe/ranz.htm#PARTITION score]; [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swissinfo.html?sid=7020216&cKey=1183635931000&ty=st&rubricId=25004&siteSect=25001 audio]) is a traditional Swiss melody often heard on the alphorn. The song describes the time of bringing the cows to the high country at cheese making time. [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] introduced the \"Ranz des Vaches\" into his masterpiece ''William Tell,'' along with many other delightful melodies scattered throughout the opera in vocal and instrumental parts that are well-suited to the alphorn.

In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. In certain states, the term army refers to the entire armed forces (e.g., People's Liberation Army). Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. \n\nIn several countries, the army is officially called the '''Land Army''' to differentiate it from an [[air force]] called the '''Air Army''', notably [[French Air Force|France]]. In such countries, the word \"army\" on its own retains its connotation of a land force in common usage. The current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force]] of [[China]] with 1,600,000 active troops and 510,000 [[Military reserve force|reserve personnel]] followed by the [[Indian Army]] with 1,129,000 active troops and 960,000 reserve personnel.\n\nBy convention, [[irregular military]] is understood in contrast to [[regular army|regular armies]] which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite [[militia]]. Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. Regular military can also refer to full-time status ([[standing army]]), versus [[Military reserve force|reserve]] or part-time personnel. Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the [[National Defence Act]]), from de facto \"non-statutory\" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. Armies may also be [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] (designed for overseas or international deployment) or [[fencible]] (designed for \u2013 or restricted to \u2013 homeland defence)\n\n==History==\n{{for|the magazine ''Army History''|United_States_Army_Center_of_Military_History#Fellowships_and_publications}}\n\n===India===\n[[India]] has had the earliest armies in the world. The first known recorded battles, the [[Battle of the Ten Kings|War of the 10 Kings]], happened when a [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Hindu Aryan]] emperor Sudas defeated an alliance of ten kings and their supportive chieftains. During the Iron Age, the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] and [[Nanda Empire|Nanda]] Empires had the largest armies in the world, the peak being approximately over 600,000 Infantry, 30,000 Cavalry, 8,000 [[Ratha|War-Chariots]] and 9,000 War Elephants not including [[tributary state]] allies.<ref>{{citation |last=Majumdar |first=Ramesh Chandra |authorlink=R.

By the [[Warring States period]], the crossbow had been perfected enough to become a military secret, with bronze bolts which could pierce any armor. Thus any political power of a state rested on the armies and their organization. China underwent political consolidation of the states of [[Han (state)|Han (\u97d3)]], [[Wei (state)|Wei (\u9b4f)]], [[Chu (state)|Chu (\u695a)]], [[Yan (state)|Yan (\u71d5)]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao (\u8d99)]] and [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi (\u9f4a)]], until by 221 BCE, [[Qin Shi Huang]] (\u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d), the first emperor of the [[Qin dynasty]], attained absolute power. This first emperor of China could command the creation of a [[Terracotta Army]] to guard his tomb in the city of [[Xi'an]] (\u897f\u5b89), as well as a realignment of the [[Great Wall of China]] to strengthen his empire against insurrection, invasion and incursion.\n\n[[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' remains one of China's [[Seven Military Classics]], even though it is two thousand years old.<ref>In the twentieth c., [[Mao Zedong]] (People's Republic of China), General [[Vo Nguyen Giap]] (Viet Nam), General [[Douglas MacArthur]] (United States),  and in medieval [[Japan]], [[Takeda Shingen]] (1521\u20131573) have drawn inspiration from the work</ref> Since no political figure could exist without an army, measures were taken to ensure only the most capable leaders could control the armies.<ref>\"who wishes to fight must first count the cost\" \u2014[[Sun Tzu]], ''[[The Art of War]]''</ref> [[Scholar-bureaucrat|Civil bureaucracies (\u58eb\u5927\u592b)]] arose to control the productive power of the states, and their military power.<ref>\"You conquered the empire on horseback, but from horseback you will never succeed in ruling it.\" \u2014Lu Chia, as quoted by [[Joseph Needham]], ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]''. vol 7, part II.</ref>\n\n===Sparta===\nThe [[Spartan Army]] was one of the earliest known professional armies. Boys were sent to a [[barracks]] at the age of seven or eight to train for becoming a soldier. At the age of thirty they were released from the barracks and allowed to marry and have a family. After that, men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of 60. Unlike other civilizations, whose armies had to disband during the planting and harvest seasons, the Spartan [[serf]]s or ''[[helot]]s,'' did the manual labor.\n\nThis allowed the Spartans to field a full-time army with a campaign season that lasted all year.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Spartan Army was largely composed of [[hoplite]]s, equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other. Each hoplite bore the Spartan emblem and a scarlet uniform. The main pieces of this armor were a round shield, a spear and a helmet.\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n[[File:Relief Kolumna Trajana2.jpg|thumb|A 2nd-century depiction of Roman soldiers on [[Trajan's column]]]]\n\nThe [[Roman Army]] had its origins in the citizen army of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. [[Marian Reforms|Reforms]] turned the army into a professional organization which was still largely filled by citizens, but these citizens [[career soldier|served continuously]] for 25 years before being discharged. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Knighton |first1=Andrew |title=The Roman Army \u2013 The Development Of One Of The Most Powerful Military Forces In The Ancient World |url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/ancient-history/roman-army-development-military.html |website=War History Online |accessdate=4 September 2018 |date=May 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n\nThe Romans were also noted for making use of [[Auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]], non-Romans who served with the [[Roman legion|legion]]s and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as [[skirmisher|light skirmish troops]] and [[heavy cavalry]]. After their service in the army they were made citizens of Rome and then their children were citizens also. They were also given land and money to settle in Rome. In the [[Late Roman Empire]], these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman Army; moreover, by the time of the Late Roman Empire tribes such as the [[Visigoths]] were paid to serve as [[Mercenary|mercenaries]].\n\n===Medieval Europe===\n[[File:Belagerung von Calais 1346-1347.JPG|thumb|Armies of the Middle Ages consisted of noble knights, rendering service to their [[suzerain]], and hired footsoldiers]]\nIn the earliest [[Middle Ages]] it was the obligation of every [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment, archers, and infantry. This decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time, but could lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment and abilities. The more resources the noble had access to, the better his troops would be.\n\nInitially, the words \"knight\" and \"noble\" were used interchangeably as there was not generally a distinction between them. While the nobility did fight upon horseback, they were also supported by lower class citizens - and mercenaries and criminals - whose only purpose was participating in warfare because, most often than not, they held brief employment during their lord's engagement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strong of Body, Brave and Noble: Chivalry and Society in Medieval France|last=Bouchard|first=Constance Brittain|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=0801430976|location=Ithaca|pages=13}}</ref> As the Middle Ages progressed and [[feudalism]] developed in a legitimate social and economic system, knights started to develop into their own class with a minor caveat: they were still in debt to their lord. No longer primarily driven by economic need, the newly established vassal class were, instead, driven by fealty and [[Chivalry|chivalry.]]\n\nAs central governments grew in power, a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the [[peasantry]] began to be the central recruiting tool. [[England]] was one of the most centralized states in the Middle Ages, and the armies that fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] were, predominantly, composed of paid professionals.\n\nIn theory, every Englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, especially one on the continent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carruthers|first1=Bob|title=Medieval Warfare|date=2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781781592243|page=10}}</ref>\n\nThus the [[scutage]] was introduced, whereby most Englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army. However, almost all high medieval armies in Europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops, and there was a large [[mercenary]] market in Europe from at least the early 12th century.\n\nAs the Middle Ages progressed in [[Italy]], Italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially in combination with standing forces, but in Italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states. This made them considerably less reliable than a standing army. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare in Italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles.\n\nIn 1439 the [[France|French]] legislature, known as the  [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] ([[French language|French]]: ''\u00e9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux''), passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone. There was a new tax to be raised known as the ''[[taille]]'' that was to provide funding for a new Royal army. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as ''[[Compagnie d'ordonnance|compagnies d'ordonnance]]'' on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors. The reforms of the 1440s,  eventually led to the [[Battle of Castillon|French victory at Castillon]] in 1453, and the conclusion of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By 1450 the companies were divided into the field army, known as the ''grande ordonnance'' and the garrison force known as the ''petite ordonnance'' .<ref>Vale, M.G.A. (1992). Charles VII. Berkeley: University of California Press.</ref>\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Marignano.jpg|thumb|[[Swiss mercenaries]] and German [[Landsknechts]] fighting for glory, fame and money at the [[Battle of Marignan]] (1515). The bulk of the [[Renaissance]] armies was composed of mercenaries.]]\n\nFirst [[nation state]]s lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to serve in their armies during wartime. Such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments.\n\nThe [[veteran]] soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.\n\nAs late as the 1650s, most troops were mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.\n\nThe newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state. The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the [[Fronde]] in France and the [[English Civil War]].\n\nIn many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of [[absolute monarchy]]. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions. The first state to master this process was the [[Dutch Republic]]. This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.\n\nHowever, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command. Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.\n\nAs any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies. For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals.\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|The colonels of the [[Gardes fran\u00e7aises|French Guards]] and [[Grenadier Guards|British guard]]s politely discussing who should fire first at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] (1745).<ref>Mackinnon, Daniel.

However, this would only become apparent after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. At this time, the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' and [[conscription]] would become the defining paradigm of [[modern warfare]].\n\nBefore then, however, most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities. In Spain armies were recruited from all the Spanish European territories including Spain, Italy, [[Wallonia]] ([[Walloon Guards]]) and Germany. The French recruited some soldiers from Germany, Switzerland as well as from [[Piedmont]]. Britain recruited [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Hanovrian]] troops until the late 18th century. Irish Catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many Catholic European states.\n\nPrior to the [[English Civil War]] in England, the [[monarch]] maintained a personal Bodyguard of [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], or \"gentlemen pensioners\", and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as [[Berwick on Tweed]] or [[Portsmouth]] (or [[Calais]] before it was [[Siege of Calais (1558)|recaptured]] by [[France]] in 1558).\n\nTroops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an ''ad hoc'' basis. [[Noblemen]] and professional regular [[soldier]]s were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops, raising their quotas by [[indenture]] from a variety of sources. On January 26, 1661 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the Royal Warrant that created the genesis of what would become the [[British Army]], although the Scottish and English Armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of England and Scotland in 1707. The small force was represented by only a few regiments.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]] the [[Continental Army]] was quickly disbanded as part of the Americans' distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the United States, with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding [[West Point]]'s arsenal. Then [[First American Regiment]] was established in 1784. However, because of continuing conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the [[Legion of the United States]], was established in 1791.\n\nUntil 1733 the common soldiers of [[Prussian Army]] consisted largely of [[peasantry]] recruited or impressed from [[Brandenburg]]-[[Prussia]], leading many to flee to neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Clark|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600\u20131947|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard|location=Cambridge|page=97|isbn=0-674-02385-4}}</ref> To halt this trend, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] divided Prussia into [[Cantonist (Prussia)|regimental cantons]].

In times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants. Peter I introduced a [[Imperial Russian Army|modern regular army]] built on German model, but with a new aspect: officers not necessarily from [[nobility]], as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officer's rank. Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system, per settlement. Initially it was based on the number of households, later it was based on the population numbers.<ref name=blum>Jerome Blum (1971) \"Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century\", {{ISBN|0-691-00764-0}}, pp. 465, 466</ref> The term of service in the 18th century was for life.

They replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors (''[[Ghazw|ghazi]]s'') whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted. The first Janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves, probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army's booty in kind rather than cash.\n\nFrom the 1380s onwards, their ranks were filled under the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' system, where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan. The \"recruits\" were mostly Christian youths, reminiscent of [[mamluk]]s.\n\n[[China]] organized the [[Manchu people]] into the [[Eight Banner system]] in the early 17th century. Defected [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] armies formed the [[Green Standard Army]]. These troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service.\n\n===Late modern===\n[[File:Operation Crusader.jpg|thumb|Indian Army personnel during [[Operation Crusader]] in Egypt, 1941]]\n[[Conscription]] allowed the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] to form the ''[[La Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', what [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called \"the nation in arms\", which successfully battled European professional armies.\n\nConscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.\n\n[[Canada]] also had a political dispute over conscription during [[World War II]]. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.\n\nIn developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\n[[Russia]], as well as many other nations, retains mainly a conscript army. There is also a very rare ''citizen army'' as used in [[Switzerland]] (see [[Military of Switzerland]]).\n\n==Armies as armed services==\nWestern armies are usually subdivided as follows:\n*'''[[Corps]]''': A corps usually consists of two or more divisions and is commanded by a [[lieutenant general]].\n*'''[[Division (military)|Division]]''': Each division is commanded by a [[major general]], and usually holds three brigades including infantry, artillery, engineers and communications units in addition to [[logistics]] (supply and service) support to sustain independent action. Except for the divisions operating in the mountains, divisions have at least one armored unit, some have even more depending upon their functionality. The basic building block of all ground force combat formations is the infantry division.\n*'''[[Brigade]]''': A brigade is under the command of a [[brigadier]] or [[brigadier general]] and sometimes is commanded by a [[colonel]]. It typically comprises three or more battalions of different units depending on its functionality. An independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit, an infantry unit, an armour unit and logistics to support its actions. Such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps.\n*'''[[Battalion]]''': Each battalion is commanded by a [[colonel]] or sometimes by [[lieutenant colonel]] who commands roughly 500 to 750 soldiers. This number varies depending on the functionality of the regiment. A battalion comprises 3\u20135 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] (3 rifle companies, a fire support company and headquarters company) or its functional equivalent such as batteries (artillery) or squadrons (armour and cavalry), each under the command of a [[major]]. The company can be divided into platoons, each of which can again be divided into sections or squads.

A battle is influenced at the Field Army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point.

For example, the [[First United States Army]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. In the [[British Army]] it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division).\n\nArmies (as well as [[army group]]s and [[Theater (military)|theater]]s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]], \"Armies\" could vary in size, but were subordinate to an [[Army Group]]-sized \"[[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]\" in wartime. In peacetime, a [[Army (Soviet Army)|Soviet army]] was usually subordinate to a [[military district]]. [[Viktor Suvorov]]'s ''Inside the Soviet Army'' describes how [[Cold War]] era Soviet military districts were actually composed of a front headquarters and a military district headquarters co-located for administration and [[Military deception|deception]] ('maskirovika') reasons.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Armed forces]]\n* [[Army aviation]]\n* [[World War I|First world war]]\n* [[List of armies]]\n* [[List of armies by country]]\n* [[List of numbered armies]]\n* [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel]]\n* [[Mercenary]]\n* [[Military history]]\n* [[Military organization]]\n* [[Militia]]\n* [[Military]]\n* [[Paramilitary]]\n* [[Soldier]]\n* [[War]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Army|army}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Military branches}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Armies| ]]\n[[Category:Military]]", "sha1": "jt92kbi9vu3ql8hl8nxpeb5wcv2r9nb"}}, {"title": "Alligatoridae", "ns": "0", "id": "1380", "revision": {"id": "865749851", "parentid": "865749810", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T22:09:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "Alex Cohn", "id": "60778"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/50.54.97.50|50.54.97.50]] ([[User talk:50.54.97.50|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Automatic taxobox\n| name = Alligatorids\n| taxon = Alligatoridae\n| fossil_range = [[Cretaceous]] - [[Holocene]],<ref>[http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Fossilgroups/Crocodylomorpha/Alligator.html Family Alligatoridae (Alligators and Caiman)] University of Bristol.

Their name derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el lagarto'', which means \"the lizard\".\n\n== Caimans ==\nIn [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily [[Caimaninae]], which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony [[scute]]s, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. Besides the three species in ''[[Caiman (genus)|Caiman]]'', the smooth-fronted caimans in genus ''[[Paleosuchus]]'' and the black caiman in ''[[Melanosuchus]]'' are described. Caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile-like in their movements, and have longer, sharper teeth than alligators.<ref name=\"Guggisberg\">{{cite book | author = Guggisberg, C.A.W. |url =  | title = Crocodiles: Their Natural History, Folklore, and Conservation| year = 1972 | page = 195 | isbn = 0-7153-5272-5}}</ref>\n\n''C. crocodilus'', the [[spectacled caiman]], has the widest distribution, from southern Mexico to the northern half of Argentina, and grows to a modest size of about {{convert|2.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The black caiman and [[American alligator]] are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the [[crocodile]] family.\n\nAlthough caimans have not been studied in depth, scientists have learned their mating cycles (previously thought to be spontaneous or year-round) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels, which increases chances of survival for their offspring.\n\n== Differences from crocodiles ==\n\n[[Alligator]]s differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads, with more obtuse snouts; in having the fourth, enlarged tooth of the under jaw received, not into an external notch, but into a pit formed for it within the upper one; in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the [[crocodile]]; in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips; and an intolerance to salinity, alligators strongly preferring fresh water, while crocodiles can tolerate salt water due to specialized glands for filtering out salt. In general, crocodiles tend to be more dangerous to humans than alligators. Another recently discovered trait is that of both caimans and American alligators partaking of foliage and fruit in addition to their normal diet of fish and meat.<ref>{{cite

The generic name ''Alnus'' is the equivalent [[Latin]] name. Both the Latin and the Germanic words derive from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''el-'', meaning \"red\" or \"brown\", which is also a root for the English words ''[[Elk (disambiguation)|elk]]'' and another tree: ''[[elm]]'', a tree distantly related to the alders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=elk&allowed_in_frame=0|title=elk - Origin and meaning of elk by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n\nWith a few exceptions, alders are [[deciduous]], and the leaves are alternate, simple, and [[serration|serrated]]. The [[flower]]s are [[catkin]]s with elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female catkins, often before leaves appear; they are mainly wind-pollinated, but also visited by bees to a small extent. These trees differ from the [[birch]]es (''Betula'', another genus in the family) in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity, opening to release the seeds in a similar manner to many [[conifer cone]]s.\n\nThe largest species are [[red alder]] (''A. rubra'') on the west coast of North America, and [[Alnus glutinosa|black alder]] (''A. glutinosa''), [[native plant|native]] to most of Europe and widely introduced elsewhere, both reaching over 30 m. By contrast, the widespread ''[[Alnus viridis]]'' (green alder) is rarely more than a 5-m-tall shrub.\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nAlders are commonly found near streams, rivers, and wetlands.  In the Pacific Northwest of North America, the [[Alnus rhombifolia|white alder]] (Alnus rhombifolia) unlike other northwest alders, has an affinity for warm, dry climates, where it grows along watercourses, such as along the lower [[Columbia River]] east of the Cascades and the Snake River, including Hells Canyon.\n\nAlder leaves and sometimes catkins are used as food by numerous [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on alders|butterflies and moths]].\n\n''A. glutinosa'' and ''A. viridis'' are classed as environmental weeds in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clayson|first=Howell|title=Consolidated list of environmental weeds in New Zealand|publisher=Department of Conservation|location=Wellington|date=May 2008|isbn=978-0-478-14412-3}}</ref> Alder leaves and especially the roots are important to the ecosystem because they enrich the soil with nitrogen and other nutrients.\n\n=== Nitrogen fixation ===\n\nAlder is particularly noted for its important [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with ''[[Frankia alni]]'', an [[actinomycete]], [[Filamentation|filamentous]], nitrogen-fixing [[bacteria|bacterium]]. This bacterium is found in [[root nodule]]s, which may be as large as a human fist, with many small lobes, and light brown in colour. The bacterium absorbs [[nitrogen]] from the air and makes it available to the tree. Alder, in turn, provides the bacterium with [[sugar]]s, which it produces through [[photosynthesis]]. As a result of this mutually beneficial relationship, alder improves the [[Fertility (soil)|fertility of the soil]] where it grows, and as a [[pioneer species]], it helps provide additional nitrogen for the [[Ecological succession|successional]] species which follow.\n\n[[Image:Alnus_rubra_seeds.jpg|right|thumb|A Red Alder seed is a tiny [[samara (fruit)|samara]] like those of all alders]]\nBecause of its abundance, red alder delivers large amounts of nitrogen to enrich forest soils.  Red alder stands have been found to supply between 120 and 290 pounds of nitrogen per acre (130 to 320&nbsp;kg per ha) annually to the soil.  From Alaska to Oregon, ''Alnus viridis'' subsp. ''sinuata'' (''A. sinuata'', Sitka Alder or Slide Alder), characteristically pioneer fresh, gravelly sites at the foot of retreating glaciers.  Studies show that Sitka alder, a more shrubby variety of alder, adds nitrogen to the soil at an average of 55 pounds per acre (60 per ha) per year, helping convert the sterile glacial terrain to soil capable of supporting a conifer forest.  Alders are common among the first species to colonize disturbed areas from floods, windstorms, fires, landslides, etc.  Alder groves themselves often serve as natural firebreaks since these broad-leaved trees are much less flammable than conifers.  Their foliage and leaf litter does not carry a fire well, and their thin bark is sufficiently resistant to protect them from light surface fires.  In addition, the light weight of alder seeds (650,000 per pound, or 1.5 million per kg) allows for easy dispersal by the wind.  Although it outgrows coastal Douglas-fir for the first 25 years, it is very shade intolerant and seldom lives more than 100 years.  Red alder is the Pacific Northwest's largest alder and the most plentiful and commercially important broad-leaved tree in the coastal Northwest.  Groves of red alder 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50&nbsp;cm) in diameter intermingle with young Douglas-fir forests west of the Cascades, attaining a maximum height of 100 to 110 feet (30 to 33 m) in about sixty years and then lose vigor as heart rot sets in.  Alders largely help create conditions favorable for giant conifers that replace them.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Northwest Trees: Identifying and Understanding the Region's Native Trees|last = Arno|first = Stephen|publisher = The Mountaineers Books|year = 2007|isbn = 978-1-59485-041-7|location = Seattle, WA|pages = 165\u201369|last2 = Hammerly|first2 = Ramona}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Alder root nodules\" widths=\"250px\" mode=packed>\nAn alder root nodule gall.JPG|alt=An alder root nodule|Whole root nodule\nA sectioned alder root nodule gall.JPG|alt=A sectioned alder root nodule|Sectioned root nodules\n</gallery>\n\n=== Parasites ===\nAlder roots are parasitized by [[Boschniakia rossica|northern groundcone]].\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Wappen at grossarl.png|thumb|right|Alder coat of arms of [[Grossarl]], [[Austria]]]]\n\nThe [[catkin]]s of some alder species have a degree of edibility,<ref name=\"Edible Alder Catkins\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/DatabaseSearhResult.aspx|title=Plant Search Result|author=|date=|website=www.pfaf.org}}</ref> and may be rich in protein.

As an educator, Alcott pioneered new ways of interacting with young students, focusing on a conversational style, and avoided traditional punishment. He hoped to perfect the human spirit and, to that end, advocated a [[veganism|vegan]] diet before the term was coined. He was also an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and an advocate for [[women's rights]].\n\nBorn in [[Wolcott, Connecticut]] in 1799, Alcott had only minimal formal schooling before attempting a career as a traveling salesman. Worried about how the itinerant life might have a negative impact on his soul, he turned to teaching. His innovative methods, however, were controversial, and he rarely stayed in one place very long. His most well-known teaching position was at the [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] in Boston. His experience there was turned into two books: ''Records of a School'' and ''Conversations with Children on the Gospels''. Alcott became friends with [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and became a major figure in [[transcendentalism]]. His writings on behalf of that movement, however, are heavily criticized for being incoherent. Based on his ideas for human perfection, Alcott founded [[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]], a transcendentalist experiment in community living. The project was short-lived and failed after seven months. Alcott continued to struggle financially for most of his life. Nevertheless, he continued focusing on educational projects and opened a new school at the end of his life in 1879. He died in 1888.\n\nAlcott married [[Abby May]] in 1830 and they eventually had four surviving children, all daughters. Their second was [[Louisa May Alcott|Louisa May]], who fictionalized her experience with the family in her novel ''[[Little Women]]'' in 1868.\n\n==Life and work==\n\n===Early life===\nA native [[New England]]er, Amos Bronson Alcott was born in [[Wolcott, Connecticut]] (then recently renamed from \"Farmingbury\") on November 29, 1799.<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=13}}</ref> His parents were Joseph Chatfield Alcott and Anna Bronson Alcott. The family home was in an area known as Spindle Hill, and his father, Joseph Alcox, traced his ancestry to colonial-era settlers in eastern [[Massachusetts]]. The family originally spelled their name \"Alcock\", later changed to \"Alcocke\" then \"Alcox\". Amos Bronson, the oldest of eight children, later changed the spelling to \"Alcott\" and dropped his first name.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|pp=7\u20139}}</ref>\nAt age six, young Bronson began his formal education in a one-room schoolhouse in the center of town but learned how to read at home with the help of his mother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|pp=9\u201310}}</ref> The school taught only reading, writing, and spelling and he left this school at the age of 10.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=19}}</ref> At age 13, his uncle, Reverend Tillotson Bronson, invited Alcott into his home in [[Cheshire, Connecticut]], to be educated and prepared for college.

He hoped the job would earn him enough money to support his parents, \"to make their cares, and burdens less... and get them free from debt\", though he soon spent most of his earnings on a new suit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=15}}</ref> At first, he thought it an acceptable occupation but soon worried about his spiritual well-being. In March 1823, Alcott wrote to his brother: \"Peddling is a hard place to serve God, but a capital one to serve [[Mammon]].\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=25}}</ref> Near the end of his life, he fictionalized this experience in his book, ''New Connecticut'', originally circulated only among friends before its publication in 1881.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=328}}</ref>\n\n===Early career and marriage===\n[[File:Abby May Alcott.jpg|thumb|Abby May Alcott in her later years]]\nBy the summer of 1823, Alcott returned to Connecticut in debt to his father, who bailed him out after his last two unsuccessful sales trips.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=16}}</ref> He took a job as a schoolteacher in Cheshire with the help of his Uncle Tillotson.<ref name=Bedell17>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=17}}</ref> He quickly set about reforming the school.

Many students left and were enrolled in the local common school or a recently re-opened  private school for boys.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=18}}</ref> On November 6, 1827, Alcott started teaching in [[Bristol, Connecticut]], still using the same methods he used in Cheshire, but opposition from the community surfaced quickly;<ref>{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=50}}</ref> he was unemployed by March 1828.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=32}}</ref> He moved to Boston on April 24, 1828, and was immediately impressed, referring to the city as a place \"where the light of the sun of righteousness has risen\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=34}}</ref> He opened the Salem Street Infant School two months later on June 23.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=55}}</ref> Abby May applied as his teaching assistant; instead, the couple were engaged, without consent of the family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=12}}</ref> They were married at [[King's Chapel]] on May 22, 1830; he was 30 years old and she was 29.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|pp=50\u201351}}</ref> Her brother conducted the ceremony and a modest reception followed at her father's house.<ref name=Reisen13>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=13}}</ref> After their marriage the Alcotts moved to 12 Franklin Street in Boston, a [[boarding house]] run by a Mrs. Newall.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=51}}</ref> Around this time, Alcott also first expressed his public disdain for [[slavery]]. In November 1830, he and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] founded what he later called a \"preliminary Anti-Slavery Society\", though he differed from Garrison as a [[nonresistance|nonresistant]].<ref>Perry, Lewis.

University of Tennessee Press, 1995: 81.</ref> Alcott became a member of the [[Boston Vigilance Committee]].{{sfn|Bearse|1880|p=3}}\n\nAttendance at Alcott's school was falling. A wealthy [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] named Reuben Haines proposed he and educator William Russell start a new school in Pennsylvania<ref name=Reisen13/> associated with the [[Germantown Academy]]. Alcott accepted and he and his newly pregnant wife set forth on December 14.<ref name=Matteson42>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=42}}</ref> The school was established in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=85}}</ref> and the Alcotts were offered a rent-free home by Haines. Alcott and Russell were initially concerned that the area would not be conducive to their progressive approach to education and considered establishing the school in nearby [[Philadelphia]] instead.<ref name=Matteson42/> Unsuccessful, they went back to Germantown, though the rent-free home was no longer available and the Alcotts instead had to rent rooms in a boarding-house.<ref name=Matteson43>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=43}}</ref> It was there that their first child, a daughter they named [[Anna Alcott Pratt|Anna Bronson Alcott]], was born on March 16, 1831,<ref name=Reisen13/> after 36 hours of labor.<ref name=Matteson43/> By the fall of that year, their benefactor Haines died suddenly and the Alcotts again suffered financial difficulty. \"We hardly earn the bread\", wrote Abby May to her brother, \"[and] the butter we have to think about.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|pp=14\u201315}}</ref>\n\nThe couple's only son was born on April 6, 1839, but lived only a few minutes.

[[Louisa May Alcott]] was born on her father's birthday, November 29, 1832, at a half-hour past midnight.<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=48}}</ref> Bronson described her as \"a very fine healthful child, much more so than Anna was at birth\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=5}}</ref> The Germantown school, however, was faltering; soon only eight pupils remained.<ref name=Matteson50>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=50}}</ref> Their benefactor Haines died before Louisa's birth.

As Abby wrote, his death \"has prostrated all our hopes here\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=63}}</ref> On April 10, 1833, the family moved to Philadelphia,<ref name=Matteson50/> where Alcott ran a day school. As usual, Alcott's methods were controversial; a former student later referred to him as \"the most eccentric man who ever took on himself to train and form the youthful mind.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=16}}</ref> Alcott began to believe Boston was the best place for his ideas to flourish. He contacted theologian [[William Ellery Channing]] for support. Channing approved of Alcott's methods and promised to help find students to enroll, including his daughter Mary. Channing also secured aid from Justice [[Lemuel Shaw]] and Boston mayor [[Josiah Quincy, Jr.]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=53}}</ref>\n\n===Experimental educator===\nOn September 22, 1834, Alcott opened a school of about 30 students, mostly from wealthy families.<ref name=Packer55>{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=55}}</ref> It was named the [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] because classes were held at the [[Masonic Temple]] on Tremont Street in Boston.<ref name=Dahlstrand110>{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=110}}</ref> His assistant was [[Elizabeth Palmer Peabody]], later replaced by [[Margaret Fuller]]. [[Mary Peabody Mann]] served as a French instructor for a time.<ref name=Gura88>{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=88}}</ref> The school was briefly famous, and then infamous, because of his original methods. Before 1830, writing (except in higher education) equated to rote drills in the rules of grammar, spelling, vocabulary, penmanship and transcription of adult texts. However, in that decade, progressive reformers such as Alcott, influenced by Pestalozzi as well as [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], began to advocate writing about subjects from students' personal experiences. Reformers debated against beginning instruction with rules and were in favor of helping students learn to write by expressing the personal meaning of events within their own lives. Alcott's plan was to develop self-instruction on the basis of self-analysis, with an emphasis on conversation and questioning rather than lecturing and drill, which were prevalent in the U.S. classrooms of the time. Alongside writing and reading, he gave lessons in \"spiritual culture\", which included interpretation of the [[Gospel]]s, and advocated ''object teaching'' in writing instruction.<ref>{{Cite book|title = American Journal of Education|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hgkCAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Wait, Green, and Company|date = 1828-01-01|language = en|first = William|last = Russell|first2 = William Channing|last2 = Woodbridge|first3 = Amos Bronson|last3 = Alcott}}</ref> He even went so far as to decorate his schoolroom with visual elements he thought would inspire learning: paintings, books, comfortable furniture, and busts or portraits of [[Plato]], [[Socrates]], [[Jesus]], and William Ellery Channing.<ref name=Dahlstrand110/>\n\nDuring this time, the Alcotts had another child. Born on June 24, 1835, she was named [[Elizabeth Sewall Alcott|Elizabeth Peabody Alcott]] in honor of the teaching assistant at the Temple School.<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|pp=66\u201367}}</ref> By age three, however, her mother changed her name to Elizabeth ''Sewall'' Alcott, after her own mother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=33}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Record of a School.JPG|thumb|''Record of a School'', a chronicle of Alcott's Temple School, was published in 1835.]]\nIn July 1835, Peabody published her account as an assistant to the Temple School as ''Record of a School: Exemplifying the General Principles of Spiritual Culture''.<ref name=Gura88/> While working on a second book, Alcott and Peabody had a falling out and ''Conversations with Children on the Gospels'' was prepared with help from Peabody's sister [[Sophia Peabody|Sophia]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|pp=49\u201350}}</ref> published at the end of December 1836.<ref name=Packer55/> Alcott's methods were not well received; many found his conversations on the Gospels close to blasphemous. For example, he asked students to question if Biblical miracles were literal and suggested that all people are part of God.<ref>{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=59}}</ref> In the ''[[Boston Daily Advertiser]]'', [[Nathan Hale (journalist)|Nathan Hale]] criticized Alcott's \"flippant and off hand conversation\" about serious topics from the [[Virgin birth of Jesus]] to [[circumcision]].<ref name=Gura89>{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=89}}</ref> [[Joseph T. Buckingham]] called Alcott \"either insane or half-witted\" and \"an ignorant and presuming [[charlatan]]\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref> The book did not sell well; a Boston lawyer bought 750 copies to use as waste paper.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baker|1996|p=184}}</ref>\n\nThe temple school was widely denounced in the press. Reverend [[James Freeman Clarke]] was one of Alcott's few supporters and defended him against the harsh response from Boston periodicals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=97}}</ref> Alcott was rejected by most public opinion and, by the summer of 1837, he had only 11 students left and no assistant after Margaret Fuller moved to [[Providence, Rhode Island]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=143}}</ref> The controversy had caused many parents to remove their children and, as the school closed, Alcott became increasingly financially desperate.

These \"conversations\" as he called them, were more or less informal talks on a great range of topics, spiritual, aesthetic and practical, in which he emphasized the ideas of the school of American Transcendentalists led by Emerson, who was always his supporter and discreet admirer.

He and Louisa May collaborated on a memoir and went over her papers, letters, and journals. \"My heart bleeds with the memories of those days\", he wrote, \"and even long years, of cheerless anxiety and hopeless dependence.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=387}}</ref> Louisa noted her father had become \"restless with his anchor gone\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=264}}</ref> They gave up on the memoir project and Louisa burned many of her mother's papers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=388}}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 1879, Alcott and [[Franklin Benjamin Sanborn]] wrote a prospectus for a new school which they distributed to potentially interested people throughout the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=391}}</ref> The result was the [[Concord School of Philosophy]] and Literature, which held its first session in 1879 in Alcott's study in the [[Orchard House]]. In 1880 the school moved to the Hillside Chapel, a building next to the house, where he held conversations and, over the course of successive summers, as he entered his eighties, invited others to give lectures on themes in philosophy, religion and letters.{{sfn|Richardson|1911|p=529}}  The school, considered one of the first formal adult education centers in America, was also attended by foreign scholars. It continued for nine years.\n\nIn April 1882, Alcott's friend and benefactor Ralph Waldo Emerson was sick and bedridden. After visiting him, Alcott wrote, \"Concord will be shorn of its human splendor when he withdraws behind the cloud.\" Emerson died the next day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|pp=234\u2013235}}</ref> Alcott himself moved out of Concord for his final years, settling at 10 Louisburg Square in Boston beginning in 1885.<ref>Wilson, Susan. ''The Literary Trail of Greater Boston''. Beverly, Massachusetts: Commonwealth Editions, 2005: 57. {{ISBN|1-889833-67-3}}</ref>\n\nAs he was bedridden at the end of his life, Alcott's daughter Louisa May came to visit him at Louisburg on March 1, 1888. He said to her, \"I am going ''up. Come with me''.\" She responded, \"I wish I could.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=423}}</ref> He died three days later on March 4; Louisa May died only two days after her father.\n\n==Beliefs==\nAlcott was fundamentally and philosophically opposed to [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] as a means of disciplining his students. Instead, beginning at the Temple School, he would appoint a daily student superintendent. When that student observed an infraction, he or she reported it to the rest of the class and, as a whole, they deliberated on punishment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=87}}</ref> At times, Alcott offered his own hand for an offending student to strike, saying that any failing was the teacher's responsibility. The shame and guilt this method induced, he believed, was far superior to the fear instilled by corporal punishment; when he used physical \"correction\" he required that the students be unanimously in support of its application, even including the student to be punished.\n\nThe most detailed discussion of his theories on education is in an essay, \"Observations on the Principles and Methods of Infant Instruction\". Alcott believed that early education must draw out \"unpremeditated thoughts and feelings of the child\" and emphasized that infancy should primarily focus on enjoyment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=53}}</ref> He noted that learning was not about the acquisition of facts but the development of a reflective state of mind.<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=58}}</ref>\n\nAlcott's ideas as an educator were controversial. Writer [[Harriet Martineau]], for example, wrote dubiously that, \"the master presupposes his little pupils possessed of all truth; and that his business is to bring it out into expression\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=59}}</ref> Even so, his ideas helped to found one of the first adult education centers in America, and provided the foundation for future generations of liberal education. Many of Alcott's educational principles are still used in classrooms today, including \"teach by encouragement\", art education, music education, acting exercises, learning through experience, risk-taking in the classroom, tolerance in schools, physical education/recess, and early childhood education. The teachings of William Ellery Channing a few years earlier had also laid the groundwork for the work of most of the Concord Transcendentalists.{{sfn|Richardson|1911|p=528}}\n\nThe Concord School of Philosophy, which closed following Alcott's death in 1888, was reopened almost 90 years later in the 1970s. It has continued functioning with a Summer Conversational Series in its original building at Orchard House, now run by the Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association.\n\nWhile many of Alcott's ideas continue to be perceived as being on the liberal/radical edge, they are still common themes in society, including vegetarian/[[veganism]], sustainable living, and temperance/self-control. Alcott described his sustenance as a \"Pythagorean diet\": meat, eggs, butter, cheese, and milk were excluded and drinking was confined to well water.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baker|1996|p=217}}</ref> Alcott believed that diet held the key to human perfection and connected physical well-being to mental improvement. He further viewed a perfection of nature to the spirit and, in a sense, predicted modern [[environmentalism]] by condemning [[pollution]] and encouraging humankind's role in sustaining ecology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=280}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n[[File:Mr Alcott's study.jpg|thumb|left|Alcott in his study at Orchard House]]\nAlcott's philosophical teachings have been criticized as inconsistent, hazy or abrupt.

He reflected that the event was a prophecy that he would be \"tilting at the sun and always catching the fall\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=15}}</ref>\n\nLike Emerson, Alcott was always optimistic, idealistic, and individualistic in thinking. Writer [[James Russell Lowell]] referred to Alcott in his poem \"Studies for Two Heads\" as \"an angel with clipped wings\".<ref name=Bedell319/> Even so, Emerson noted that Alcott's brilliant conversational ability did not translate into good writing. \"When he sits down to write,\" Emerson wrote, \"all his genius leaves him; he gives you the shells and throws away the kernel of his thought.\"<ref name=Reisen35/> His \"Orphic Sayings\", published in ''The Dial'', became famous for their hilarity as dense, pretentious, and meaningless. In New York, for example, ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'' published a parody titled \"Gastric Sayings\" in November 1840. A writer for the ''Boston Post'' referred to Alcott's \"Orphic Sayings\" as \"a train of fifteen railroad cars with one passenger\".<ref name=Packer116/>\n\nModern critics{{who|date=October 2011}} often fault Alcott for not being able to financially support his family.

If arachnophobies see a spider, they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the [[panic attack]] that is often associated with their phobia. Some people [[screaming|scream]], [[cry]], have emotional outbursts, experience trouble breathing, [[Perspiration|sweat]], have heart palpitations, or even faint when they come in contact with an area near spiders or their webs. In some extreme cases, even a [[picture]] or a realistic drawing of a spider can [[Trauma trigger|trigger]] intense [[fear]].\n\n==Reasons==\nArachnophobia may be an exaggerated form of an [[instinct]]ive response that helped early humans to survive,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Friedenberg, J. |author2=Silverman, G. |title=Cognitive Science: An Introduction to the Study of Mind|publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |isbn=1-4129-2568-1 |pages=244\u2013245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGti6_4Qn_QC&pg=PA244|accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref> or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Davey, G.C.L.|title=The \"Disgusting\" Spider: The Role of Disease and Illness in the Perpetuation of Fear of Spiders|journal=Society and Animals |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=1994 |pages=17\u201325 |doi=10.1163/156853094X00045}}</ref>\n\n===Evolutionary===\nAn evolutionary reason for the phobia remains unresolved. One view, especially held in [[evolutionary psychology]], is that the presence of [[Spider bite|venomous spiders]] led to the evolution of a fear of spiders, or made acquisition of a fear of spiders especially easy. Like all traits, there is variability in the intensity of fear of spiders, and those with more intense fears are classified as phobic. Being relatively small, spiders do not fit the usual criterion for a threat in the [[animal|animal kingdom]] where size is a factor, but they can have medically significant [[Venom (poison)|venom]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} However, a phobia is an irrational fear as opposed to a rational fear.<ref>https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/features/fear-factor-phobias#1</ref>\n\nBy ensuring that their surroundings were free from spiders, arachnophobes would have had a reduced risk of being bit in ancestral environments, giving them a slight advantage over non-arachnophobes in terms of survival. However, having a disproportionate fear of spiders in comparison to other, potentially dangerous creatures<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://courses.washington.edu/evpsych/spiders%20are%20special%20-%20EHB%202009.pdf|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2008.08.005|title=Spiders are special: fear and disgust evoked by pictures of arthropods|last1=Gerdes|first1=Antje B.M.|last2=Uhl|first2=Gabriele|last3=Alpers|first3=Georg W.|journal=[[Evolution and Human Behavior]]|volume=30|pages=66\u201373}}</ref> present during ''Homo sapiens''' [[Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of evolutionary adaptiveness]] may have had drawbacks.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nA 2001 study found that people could detect images of spiders among images of flowers and mushrooms more quickly than they could detect images of flowers or mushrooms among images of spiders.

Sometimes, even an object resembling a spider can trigger a panic attack in an arachnophobia individual.

For some communities such as in [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Cambodia]] spiders are included in traditional foods.

[[Egyptian Museum]], Cairo.]]\n\n'''Alabaster''' is a [[mineral]] or rock that is soft, often used for carving, and is processed for [[plaster]] powder. Archaeologists and the stone processing industry use the word differently from [[geologist]]s. The former use is in a wider sense that includes varieties of two different minerals: the fine-grained massive type of [[gypsum]]<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/science/gypsum  ''Gypsum'', Britannica, retrieved 8 January 2017]</ref> and the fine-grained banded type of [[calcite]].<ref name=\"OxfMuseum\">''More about alabaster and travertine'', brief guide explaining the different use of these words by geologists, archaeologists, and those in the stone trade. Oxford University Museum of Natural History, 2012, [http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/corsi/files/pdf/Alabaster-travertine.pdf]</ref> [[Geology|Geologists]] define alabaster only as the [[gypsum]] type.<ref name=\"OxfMuseum\"/> Chemically, [[gypsum]] is a [[Water of crystallization|hydrous]] [[sulfur|sulfate]] of [[calcium]], while [[calcite]] is a [[carbonate]] of calcium.<ref name=\"Grove\" /> \n\nBoth types of alabaster have similar properties. They are usually lightly colored, translucent, and soft stones. They have been used throughout history primarily for carving decorative artifacts.<ref name=\"Grove\">\"Grove\": R. W. Sanderson and Francis Cheetham. \"Alabaster\", [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 13 March 2013, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T001400 subscriber link].</ref>\n\nThe calcite type is also denominated \"'''onyx-marble'''\", \"'''Egyptian alabaster'''\", and \"'''Oriental alabaster'''\" and is geologically described as either a compact banded [[travertine]]<ref name=\"OxfMuseum\" /> or \"a [[stalagmitic]] [[limestone]] marked with patterns of swirling bands of cream and brown\".<ref name=\"Grove\"/> \"Onyx-marble\" is a traditional, but geologically inaccurate, name because both [[onyx]] and [[marble]] have geological definitions that are distinct from even the broadest definition of \"alabaster\".\n\nIn general, ancient alabaster is [[calcite]] in the wider [[Middle East]], including [[Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], while it is [[gypsum]] in medieval [[Europe]]. Modern alabaster is probably [[calcite]] but may be either. Both are easy to work and slightly soluble in water. They have been used for making a variety of indoor artwork and carving, and they will not survive long outdoors.\n\nThe two kinds are readily distinguished by their different hardnesses: gypsum alabaster is so soft that a fingernail scratches it ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] 1.5 to 2), while calcite cannot be scratched in this way (Mohs hardness 3), although it yields to a knife. Moreover, calcite alabaster, being a [[carbonate]], [[effervescence|effervesces]] when treated with [[hydrochloric acid]], while gypsum alabaster remains almost unaffected when thus treated.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alabaster|volume=1|pages=466-467|first=Frederick William|last=Rudler}} Endnotes:\n* M.

It is found as either a [[stalagmite|stalagmitic]] deposit from the floor and walls of [[limestone]] [[cavern]]s, or as a kind of [[travertine]], similarly deposited in springs of calcareous water.

The [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''alabastrites'' is said to be derived from the town of Alabastron in [[Egypt]], where the stone was quarried. The locality probably owed its name to the mineral;{{dubious|Circular argumentation...|date=July 2016}} the origin of the mineral name is obscure<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> (though see [[Alabaster#Etymology|above]]).\n\nThe \"Oriental\" alabaster was highly esteemed for making small perfume bottles or ointment vases called [[alabastron|alabastra]]; the vessel name has been suggested as a possible source of the mineral name. In Egypt, craftsmen used alabaster for [[canopic jar]]s and various other sacred and sepulchral objects. A [[sarcophagus]] discovered in the tomb of [[Seti I]] near [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] is on display in [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], [[London]]; it is carved in a single block of translucent calcite alabaster from Alabastron.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[Algeria]]n onyx-marble has been quarried largely in the province of [[Oran]].\n\n====North America====\nIn [[Mexico]], there are famous deposits of a delicate green variety at [[La Pedrara]], in the district of [[Tecali]], near [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].

[[Tuscany|Tuscan]] alabaster occurs in nodular masses embedded in limestone, interstratified with [[marl]]s of [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] age. The mineral is worked largely by means of underground galleries, in the district of [[Volterra]]. Several varieties are recognized\u2014veined, spotted, clouded, agatiform, and others. The finest kind, obtained principally from [[Castellina Marittima|Castellina]], is sent to Florence for figure-sculpture, while the common kinds are carved locally, into vases, lights, and various ornamental objects. These items are objects of extensive trade, especially in Florence, [[Pisa]], and [[Livorno]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn the 3rd century BC the [[Etruscans]] used the alabaster of Tuscany from the area of modern-day Volterra to produce [[funeral urn]]s, possibly taught by Greek artists.<ref name=\"Volterra\">[http://www.volterratur.it/en/come/alabaster/the-alabaster-history/  Official website of Volterra]</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]] the craft of alabaster was almost completely forgotten.<ref name=\"Volterra\"/> A revival started in the mid-16th century, and until the beginning of the 17th century alabaster work was strictly artistic and did not expand to form a large industry.<ref name=\"BruciHist\">[http://www.alialabastro.it/alabastrostoria-en.html  Italian Alabaster Works of G.

The new industry prospered, but the reduced need of skilled craftsmen left only few still working. The 19th century brought a boom to the industry, largely due to the \"traveling artisans\" who went and offered their wares to the palaces of Europe, as well as to America and the East.<ref name=\"BruciHist\"/>\n\nIn the 19th century new processing technology was also introduced, allowing for the production of custom-made, unique pieces, as well as the combination of alabaster with other materials.<ref name=\"BruciHist\"/> Apart from the newly developed craft, artistic work became again possible, chiefly by Volterran sculptor [[Albino Funaioli]].<ref name=\"BruciHist\"/> After a short slump, the industry was revived again by the sale of mass-produced mannerist [[Expressionist]] sculptures, and was further enhanced in the 1920s by a new branch creating ceiling and wall lamps in the [[Art Deco]] style and culminating in the participation at the 1925 [[International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts]] from [[Paris]].<ref name=\"BruciHist\"/> Important names from the evolution of alabaster use after [[World War II]] are Volterran [[Umberto Borgna]], the \"first alabaster designer\", and later on the architect and [[industrial design]]er [[Angelo Mangiarotti]].<ref>[http://www.toscana900.com/en/museo/ecomuseo-dellalabastro/][[:it:Ecomuseo dell'alabastro]]<span>, Volterra; official website</span></ref>\n\n====England and Wales====\n[[File:English - Resurrection - Walters 27308.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Resurrection of Christ]], typical [[Nottingham alabaster]] panel from an altarpiece set, 1450\u201390, with remains of the paint]]\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Henry IV of England]] -->\nGypsum alabaster is a common mineral, which occurs in England in the [[Keuper]] [[marl]]s of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], especially at [[Chellaston]] in [[Derbyshire]], at Fauld in [[Staffordshire]], and near [[Newark, England|Newark]] in [[Nottinghamshire]].

These were usually painted, or partly painted. It was also used for the effigies, often life size, on [[tomb monument]]s, as the typical recumbent position suited the material's lack of strength, and it was cheaper and easier to work than good marble. After the [[English Reformation]] the making of altarpiece sets was discontinued, but funerary monument work in reliefs and statues continued.\n\nBesides examples of these carvings still in Britain (especially at the [[Nottingham Castle Museum]], [[British Museum]], and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), trade in mineral alabaster (rather than just the antiques trade) has scattered examples in the material that may be found as far afield as the [[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny]], Spain, and Scandinavia.\n\nAlabaster also is found, although in smaller quantity, at [[Watchet]] in [[Somerset]], near [[Penarth]] in [[Glamorganshire]], and elsewhere. In [[Cumbria]] it occurs largely in the New Red rocks, but at a lower geological horizon. The alabaster of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire is found in thick nodular beds or \"floors\" in spheroidal masses known as \"balls\" or \"bowls\" and in smaller lenticular masses termed \"cakes.\" At Chellaston, where the local alabaster is known as \"Patrick,\" it has been worked into ornaments under the name of \"Derbyshire spar\"\u2015a term more properly applied to [[fluorspar]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n====Black alabaster====\n''Black alabaster'' is a rare anhydrite form of the gypsum-based mineral.

[[Shalmaneser III]] documented 853 BC that he defeated an alliance of a dozen kings in the [[Battle of Qarqar]]; one of these was Ahab.\n\nAhab became king of Israel in the thirty-eighth year of [[Asa of Judah|Asa, king of Judah]], and reigned for twenty-two years, according to 1 Kings.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|16:29|NIV}}</ref> [[William F.

During Ahab's reign, [[Moab]], which had been conquered by his father, remained tributary. Ahab was allied by marriage with [[Jehoshaphat]], who was king of [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Only with [[Aram Damascus]] is he believed to have had strained relations.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ahab|volume=1|pages=428\u2013429}}</ref>\n\nAhab married [[Jezebel]], the daughter of the King of [[Tyre,_Lebanon|Tyre]]. 1 Kings 16\u201322 tells the story of Ahab and Jezebel, and indicates that Jezebel was a dominant influence on Ahab and strove to spread idol worship of [[Baal]] in Israel.<ref>[[1 Kings]] 16:31, 18:4\u201319, 19:1\u20132, 21:5\u201325.</ref> Ahab lived in [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], the royal capital established by Omri, and built a temple and altar to Baal there.<ref>1 Kings 16:32</ref> He was succeeded by [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]] and [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]], who reigned over Israel until Jehu's revolt of 842 BC.<ref>Michael D.

(See [[List of artifacts significant to the Bible]])]]\n\n===Battle of Qarqar===\nThe [[Battle of Qarqar]] is mentioned in extra-biblical records, and was perhaps at [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]], where [[Shalmaneser III]] of [[Assyria]] fought a great confederation of princes from [[Cilicia]], Northern [[Syria]], Israel, [[Ammon]], and the tribes of the Syrian desert (853 BC), including Ahab the Israelite (''A-ha-ab-bu <sup>mat</sup>Sir-'a-la-a-a'')<ref name=Craig>Craig, \"The Monolith Inscription of Salmaneser II\"</ref> and [[Hadadezer]] (''Adad-'idri'').<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAhab's contribution was estimated at 2,000 [[chariot]]s and 10,000 men. In reality, however, the number of chariots in Ahab's forces was probably closer to a number in the hundreds (based upon archaeological excavations of the area and the foundations of stables that have been found).<ref name=\"Michael D. Coogan 2009\">Michael D. Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 243.</ref> If, however, the numbers are referring to allies it could possibly include forces from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], Judah, [[Edom]], and Moab. The Assyrian king claimed a victory, but his immediate return and subsequent expeditions in 849 BC and 846 BC against a similar but unspecified coalition seem to show that he met with no lasting success. According to the [[Tanakh]], however, Ahab with 7,000 troops had previously overthrown [[Hadadezer|Ben-hadad]] and his thirty-two kings, who had come to lay siege to [[Samaria]], and in the following year obtained a decisive victory over him at [[Aphek (biblical)|Aphek]], probably in the [[plain of Sharon]] at [[Antipatris]] (1 Kings 20). A treaty was made whereby Ben-hadad restored the cities which his father had taken from Ahab's father, and trading facilities between Damascus and Samaria were granted.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]] has been identified as Ahab's fortified chariot and cavalry base.<ref name=Ussishkin>David Ussishkin, \"Jezreel\u2014Where Jezebel Was Thrown to the Dogs\", ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' July / August 2010.</ref>\n\n===Ahab and the Prophets===\nIn the Biblical text, Ahab has five important encounters with prophets:\n#The first encounter is with [[Elijah]], whom Ahab refers to as \"the troubler of Israel\" (1 Kings 18:17), in which Elijah predicts a drought (1 Kings 17:1). This encounter ends with Elijah victorious over the official [[Baal]] prophets of Israel in a contest held for the sake of the Israelites and their king, Ahab. The contest ends when Elijah's God consumes the offering which the Baal worshipers could not induce their god to touch, after which Elijah slaughters the Baal prophets (1 Kings 18:17\u201340).\n#The second encounter is between Ahab and an unnamed prophet in 1 Kings 20:22.\n#The third is again between Ahab and an unnamed prophet who condemns Ahab for his actions in a battle that had just taken place (1 Kings 20:34-43).\n#The fourth is when Elijah confronts Ahab over Ahab's and Jezebel's execution of Naboth and usurpation of the latter's ancestral vineyard (1 Kings 21:1-16). Upon the prophet's remonstration (\"Hast thou killed and also taken possession?\" (1 Kings, 21:19)), Ahab displayed sincere remorse (1 Kings 21:27).\n#The fifth encounter is with [[Micaiah]], the prophet who, when asked for advice on a military campaign, first assures Ahab he will be successful and ultimately gives Ahab a glimpse into God's plan for Ahab to die in battle (1 Kings 22).<ref>Achtemeier, Paul (Editor), The HarperCollins Bible Dictionary, (New York: HarperCollins, 1996), p. 18.</ref>\n\n===Death of Ahab===\n[[File:093.The Death of Ahab.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Death of Ahab, by Gustave Dor\u00e9]]\nThree years later, war broke out east of the [[Jordan River]], and Ahab with Jehoshaphat of Judah went to recover [[Battle of Ramoth-Gilead|Ramoth-Gilead]] from the Arameans.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> During this battle, Ahab disguised himself, but he was mortally wounded by an unaimed arrow (1 Kings 22). The Hebrew Bible says that dogs licked his blood, according to the prophecy of Elijah. But the [[Septuagint]] (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) adds that pigs also licked his blood, symbolically making him unclean to the Israelites, who abstained from pork. Ahab was succeeded by his sons, [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]] and [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]].\n\nJezebel's death, however, was more dramatic than Ahab's. As recorded in 2 Kings 9:30-34, Jezebel was confronted by Jehu who had her servants [[Defenestration|throw her out the window]], causing her death.\n\n==Legacy==\n1 Kings 16:29 through 22:40 contains the story of Ahab's reign. This reign is one which faces opposition from several prophets of [[Yahweh]] throughout as well as various consequences because of his marriage to Jezebel, because of his worship of Baal, disobedience to prophetic warnings and words, and also because of the murder of Naboth. The murder of [[Naboth]] (see [[Jezebel (biblical)|Jezebel]]), an act of royal encroachment, stirred up popular resentment just as the new cult aroused the opposition of the Israelite prophets, including Elijah and Micaiah. Indeed, he is referred to, for this and other things, as being \"more evil than all the kings before him\" (1 Kings 16:30). The followers of Yahweh found their champion in Elijah. His denunciation of the royal dynasty of Israel and his emphatic insistence on the worship of Yahweh and Yahweh alone, illustrated by the contest between Yahweh and Baal on [[Mount Carmel]] (1 Kings 18), form the keynote to a period which culminated in the accession of [[Jehu]], an event in which Elijah's chosen disciple [[Elisha]] was the leading figure.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Captain Ahab]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Craig, James A.

The total mass of the system is about 5.8 solar masses, and the mass ratios of Aa1, Aa2, and Ab are about 4.5 to 1 to 2.\n\nThe three components of the bright triple star used to be, and still sometimes are, referred to as \u03b2 Per A, B, and C.

He grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by others' reactions to what they took as his recalcitrant insubordination. He was [[Impressment|pressed]] (conscripted) into service in the [[Royal Navy]], and after leaving the service, he became involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of [[County Donegal]], [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], so severely that he called out to God for mercy, a moment that marked [[John Newton#Spiritual conversion|his spiritual conversion]]. He continued his slave trading career until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether and began studying [[Christian theology]].\n\nOrdained in the [[Church of England]] in 1764, Newton became [[curate]] of [[Olney, Buckinghamshire]], where he began to write hymns with poet [[William Cowper]]. \"Amazing Grace\" was written to illustrate a sermon on New Year's Day of 1773. It is unknown if there was any music accompanying the verses; it may have simply been chanted by the congregation. It debuted in print in 1779 in Newton and Cowper's ''[[Olney Hymns]]'' but settled into relative obscurity in England. In the United States, however, \"Amazing Grace\" was used extensively during the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the early 19th century. It has been associated with more than 20 melodies, but in 1835 it was joined to a tune named \"New Britain\" to which it is most frequently sung today. \n\nWith the message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of sins committed and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of God, \"Amazing Grace\" is one of the most recognisable songs in the English-speaking world. Author [[Gilbert Chase]] writes that it is \"without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns\",<ref>Chase, p. 181.</ref> and Jonathan Aitken, a Newton biographer, estimates that it is performed about 10&nbsp;million times annually.<ref name=\"aitken224\"/> It has had particular influence in [[folk music]], and has become an emblematic [[Negro spiritual|African American spiritual]]. Its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music. \"Amazing Grace\" saw a resurgence in popularity in the U.S. during the 1960s and has been recorded thousands of times during and since the 20th century, occasionally appearing on popular music charts.\n\n== John Newton's conversion ==\n{{quote box\n| width = 22em\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote = How industrious is Satan served.

Retrieved on October 31, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 1725, Newton was born in [[Wapping]], a district in London near the [[Thames]]. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] but had [[Protestantism|Protestant]] sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the [[Anglican Church]]. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of [[tuberculosis]] when he was six years old.<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 8\u20139.</ref> For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated.<ref>Newton (1824), p. 12.</ref> At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an [[apprentice]]; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.\n\nAs a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed ''Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times'', a book by the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Earl of Shaftesbury]], with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the [[Gospel]] at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\"<ref>Newton (1824), pp. 21\u201322.</ref> His disobedience caused him to be [[Impressment|pressed]] into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \"Polly\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.<ref>Martin (1950), p. 23.</ref> After enduring humiliation for deserting,{{efn|Stripped of his rank, whipped in public, and subjected to the abuses directed to prisoners and other press-ganged men in the Navy, he demonstrated insolence and rebellion during his service for the next few months, remarking that the only reason he did not murder the captain or commit suicide was because he did not want Polly to think badly of him. (Martin [1950], pp. 41\u201347.)}} he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading.{{efn|Newton kept a series of detailed journals as a slave trader; these are perhaps the first primary source of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from the perspective of a merchant (Moyers). Women, naked or nearly so, upon their arrival on ship were claimed by the sailors, and Newton alluded to sexual misbehavior in his writings that has since been interpreted by historians to mean that he, along with other sailors, took (and presumably raped) whomever he chose. (Martin [1950], pp.&nbsp;82\u201385)(Aitken, p. 64.)}}\n \n[[File:Newton j.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Engraving of an older heavyset man, wearing robes, vestments, and wig|[[John Newton]] in his later years]]\n\nNewton often openly mocked the captain by creating obscene poems and songs about him that became so popular the crew began to join in.<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 51\u201352.</ref> He entered into disagreements with several colleagues that resulted in his being starved almost to death, imprisoned while at sea and chained like the slaves they carried, then outright enslaved and forced to work on a plantation in [[Sierra Leone]] near the [[Sherbro River]]. After several months he came to think of Sierra Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and a ship found him by coincidence.{{efn|Newton's father was friends with Joseph Manesty, who intervened several times in Newton's life. Newton was supposed to go to Jamaica on Manesty's ship, but missed it while he was with the Catletts. When Newton's father got his son's letter detailing his conditions in Sierra Leone, he asked Manesty to find Newton. Manesty sent the ''Greyhound'', which traveled along the African coast trading at various stops. An associate of Newton lit a fire signaling to ships he was interested in trading only 30 minutes before the ''Greyhound'' appeared. (Aitken, pp. 34\u201335, 64\u201365.)}} Newton claimed the only reason he left was because of Polly.<ref>Martin (1950), p. 63.</ref>\n\nWhile aboard the ship ''Greyhound'', Newton gained notoriety for being one of the most profane men the captain had ever met. In a culture where sailors commonly used oaths and swore, Newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard, but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery.<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 67\u201368.</ref> In March 1748, while the ''Greyhound'' was in the North Atlantic, a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where Newton had been moments before.{{efn|Several retellings of Newton's life story claim that he was carrying slaves during the voyage in which he experienced his conversion, but the ship was carrying livestock, wood, and beeswax from the coast of Africa. (Aitken, p. 76.)}} After hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized, Newton and another mate tied themselves to the ship's pump to keep from being washed overboard, working for several hours.<ref name=Martin73/> After proposing the measure to the captain, Newton had turned and said, \"If this will not do, then Lord have mercy upon us!\"<ref>Newton (1824), p. 41.</ref><ref>Martin (1950), pp. 70\u201371.</ref> Newton rested briefly before returning to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours. During his time at the wheel he pondered his divine challenge.<ref name=Martin73>Martin (1950), p. 73.</ref>\n\nAbout two weeks later, the battered ship and starving crew landed in [[Lough Swilly|Lough Swilly, Ireland]]. For several weeks before the storm, Newton had been reading ''The Christian's Pattern'', a summary of the 15th-century ''[[The Imitation of Christ (book)|The Imitation of Christ]]'' by [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]]. The memory of his own \"Lord have mercy upon us!\" uttered during a moment of desperation in the storm did not leave him; he began to ask if he was worthy of God's mercy or in any way redeemable as he had not only neglected his faith but directly opposed it, mocking others who showed theirs, deriding and denouncing God as a myth. He came to believe that God had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him.<ref>Aitken, pp. 81\u201384.</ref>\n\nNewton's conversion was not immediate, but he contacted Polly's family and announced his intentions to marry her. Her parents were hesitant as he was known to be unreliable and impetuous. They knew he was profane, but they allowed him to write to Polly, and he set to begin to submit to authority for her sake.<ref name=\"martin82-85\">Martin (1950), pp. 82\u201385.</ref> He sought a place on a slave ship bound for Africa, and Newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before; the only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity. After a severe illness his resolve was renewed, yet he retained the same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries.{{efn|When Newton began his journal in 1750, not only was slave trading seen as a respectable profession by the majority of Britons, its necessity to the overall prosperity of the kingdom was communally understood and approved. Only [[Quaker]]s, who were much in the minority and perceived as eccentric, had raised any protest about the practice. (Martin and Spurrell [1962], pp. xi\u2013xii.)}} Newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed up rivers in Africa{{snd}} now as a captain{{snd}} procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports, and subsequently transported them to North America. In between voyages, he married Polly in 1750 and he found it more difficult to leave her at the beginning of each trip. After three shipping experiences in the slave trade, Newton was promised a position as ship's captain with cargo unrelated to slavery when, at the age of thirty, he collapsed and never sailed again.<ref>Aitken, p. 125.</ref>{{efn|Newton's biographers and Newton himself does not put a name to this episode other than a \"fit\" in which he became unresponsive, suffering dizziness and a headache. His doctor advised him not to go to sea again, and Newton complied. Jonathan Aitken called it a [[stroke]] or [[seizure]], but its cause is unknown.

The people were mostly illiterate and many of them were poor.<ref name=\"aitken224\">Aitken, p. 224.</ref> Newton's preaching was unique in that he shared many of his own experiences from the pulpit; many clergy preached from a distance, not admitting any intimacy with temptation or sin. He was involved in his parishioners' lives and was much loved, although his writing and delivery were sometimes unpolished.<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 208\u2013217.</ref> But his devotion and conviction were apparent and forceful, and he often said his mission was to \"break a hard heart and to heal a broken heart\".<ref name=\"pollock\"/> He struck a friendship with [[William Cowper]], a gifted writer who had failed at a career in law and suffered bouts of insanity, attempting suicide several times. Cowper enjoyed Olney{{snd}} and Newton's company; he was also new to Olney and had gone through a spiritual conversion similar to Newton's. Together, their effect on the local congregation was impressive. In 1768, they found it necessary to start a weekly prayer meeting to meet the needs of an increasing number of parishioners. They also began writing lessons for children.<ref>Turner, p. 76.</ref>\n\nPartly from Cowper's literary influence, and partly because learned vicars were expected to write verses, Newton began to try his hand at hymns, which had become popular through the language, made plain for common people to understand. Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including [[Isaac Watts]]{{snd}} whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing<ref>Aitken, p. 28.</ref>{{snd}} and [[Charles Wesley]], with whom Newton was familiar. Wesley's brother [[John Wesley|John]], the eventual founder of the Methodist Church, had encouraged Newton to go into the clergy.{{efn|Watts had previously written a hymn named \"Alas! And Did My Saviour Bleed\" that contained the lines \"Amazing pity! Grace unknown!/ And love beyond degree!\". [[Philip Doddridge]], another well-known hymn writer, wrote another in 1755 titled \"The Humiliation and Exaltation of God's Israel\" that began \"Amazing grace of God on high!\" and included other similar wording to Newton's verses. Newton biographer Jonathan Aitken states that Watts had inspired most of Newton's compositions. (Turner, pp. 82\u201383.)(Aitken, pp. 28\u201329.)}} Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his work after the [[Psalms]]. The most prevalent hymns by Watts and others were written in the [[common meter]] in 8.6.8.6: the first line is eight syllables and the second is six.<ref name=\"turner77-79\">Turner, pp. 77\u201379.</ref>\n\nNewton and Cowper attempted to present a poem or hymn for each prayer meeting. The lyrics to \"Amazing Grace\" were written in late 1772 and probably used in a prayer meeting for the first time on January 1, 1773.<ref name=\"turner77-79\"/> A collection of the poems Newton and Cowper had written for use in services at Olney was bound and published anonymously in 1779 under the title ''[[Olney Hymns]]''. Newton contributed 280 of the 348 texts in ''Olney Hymns''; \"1 Chronicles 17:16\u201317, Faith's Review and Expectation\" was the title of the poem with the first line \"Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)\".<ref name=\"dah\"/>\n\n=== Critical analysis ===\nThe general impact of ''Olney Hymns'' was immediate and it became a widely popular tool for evangelicals in Britain for many years. Scholars appreciated Cowper's poetry somewhat more than Newton's plaintive and plain language driven from his forceful personality. The most prevalent themes in the verses written by Newton in ''Olney Hymns'' are faith in salvation, wonder at [[Grace (Christianity)|God's grace]], his love for Jesus, and his cheerful exclamations of the joy he found in his faith.<ref>Benson, p. 339.</ref> As a reflection of Newton's connection to his parishioners, he wrote many of the hymns in [[first-person narrative|first person]], admitting his own experience with sin. Bruce Hindmarsh in ''Sing Them Over Again To Me: Hymns and Hymnbooks in America'' considers \"Amazing Grace\" an excellent example of Newton's testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective.<ref name=\"hindmarsh6\">Noll and Blumhofer, p. 6.</ref> Several of Newton's hymns were recognized as great work (\"Amazing Grace\" was not among them) while others seem to have been included to fill in when Cowper was unable to write.<ref>Benson, p. 338.</ref> Jonathan Aitken calls Newton, specifically referring to \"Amazing Grace\", an \"unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation\", noting that only twenty-one of the nearly 150 words used in all six verses have more than one syllable.<ref>Aitken, p. 226.</ref>\n\nWilliam Phipps in the ''[[Anglican Theological Review]]'' and author James Basker have interpreted the first stanza of \"Amazing Grace\" as evidence of Newton's realization that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness, perhaps representing a wider common understanding of Newton's motivations.<ref name=\"phipps\">Phipps, William (Summer 1990). \" 'Amazing Grace' in the hymnwriter's life\", ''[[Anglican Theological Review]]'', '''72''' (3), pp. 306\u2013313.</ref><ref name=\"basker281\"/> Newton joined forces with a young man named [[William Wilberforce]], the British Member of Parliament who led the Parliamentarian campaign to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire, culminating in the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]]. However, Newton became an ardent and outspoken [[abolitionist]] after he left Olney in the 1780s; he never connected the construction of the hymn that became \"Amazing Grace\" to anti-slavery sentiments.<ref>Aitken, p. 231.</ref> The lyrics in ''Olney Hymns'' were arranged by their association to the Biblical verses that would be used by Newton and Cowper in their prayer meetings and did not address any political objective. For Newton, the beginning of the year was a time to reflect on one's spiritual progress. At the same time he completed a diary{{snd}} which has since been lost{{snd}} that he had begun 17 years before, two years after he quit sailing. The last entry of 1772 was a recounting of how much he had changed since then.<ref name=\"aitken227\">Aitken, p. 227.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| align = left\n| width = 22em\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote = And David the king came and sat before the {{LORD}}, and said, Who ''am'' I, O {{LORD}} God, and what ''is'' mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?

Some Christians interpret this as a prediction that Jesus Christ, as a descendant of David, was promised by God as the salvation for all people.<ref name=\"hindmarsh8\">Noll and Blumhofer, p. 8.</ref> Newton's sermon on that January day in 1773 focused on the necessity to express one's gratefulness for God's guidance, that God is involved in the daily lives of Christians though they may not be aware of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await.<ref>Turner, p. 81.</ref> Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly,<ref name=\"watson215\"/> and was humbled by it. According to Newton, unconverted sinners were \"blinded by the god of this world\" until \"mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired&nbsp;... our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace.\"<ref name=\"aitken227\"/>\n\nThe [[New Testament]] served as the basis for many of the lyrics of \"Amazing Grace\". The first verse, for example, can be traced to the story of the [[Prodigal Son]]. In the [[Gospel of Luke]] the father says, \"For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost, and is found\". The story of Jesus [[Miracles of Jesus#The blind|healing a blind man]] who tells the [[Pharisees]] that he can now see is told in the [[Gospel of John]]. Newton used the words \"I was blind but now I see\" and declared \"Oh to grace how great a debtor!\" in his letters and diary entries as early as 1752.<ref name=\"aitken228\">Aitken, p. 228.</ref> The effect of the lyrical arrangement, according to Bruce Hindmarsh, allows an instant release of energy in the exclamation \"Amazing grace!\", to be followed by a qualifying reply in \"how sweet the sound\". In ''An Annotated Anthology of Hymns'', Newton's use of an exclamation at the beginning of his verse is called \"crude but effective\" in an overall composition that \"suggest(s) a forceful, if simple, statement of faith\".<ref name=\"watson215\">Watson, p. 215.</ref> Grace is recalled three times in the following verse, culminating in Newton's most personal story of his conversion, underscoring the use of his personal testimony with his parishioners.<ref name=\"hindmarsh6\"/>\n\nThe sermon preached by Newton was his last, of those that William Cowper heard in Olney, since Cowper's mental instability returned shortly thereafter. Steve Turner, author of ''Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song'', suggests Newton may have had his friend in mind, employing the themes of assurance and deliverance from despair for Cowper's benefit.<ref>Turner, p. 86.</ref>\n\n[[File:New Britain Southern Harmony Amazing Grace.jpg|thumb|450px|alt=Original long hymnal with shape note music notation of a tune titled \"New Britain\" set to Newton's first verse, with four subsequent verses printed below.

A tremendous religious movement swept the U.S. in the early 19th century, marked by the growth and popularity of churches and religious revivals that got their start in Kentucky and Tennessee. Unprecedented gatherings of thousands of people attended camp meetings where they came to experience salvation; preaching was fiery and focused on saving the sinner from temptation and backsliding.<ref name=\"turner115-116\">Turner, pp. 115\u2013116.</ref> Religion was stripped of ornament and ceremony, and made as plain and simple as possible; sermons and songs often used repetition to get across to a rural population of poor and mostly uneducated people the necessity of turning away from sin. Witnessing and testifying became an integral component to these meetings, where a congregation member or even a stranger would rise and recount his turn from a sinful life to one of piety and peace.<ref name=\"hindmarsh10\"/> \"Amazing Grace\" was one of many hymns that punctuated fervent sermons, although the contemporary style used a refrain, borrowed from other hymns, that employed simplicity and repetition such as:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAmazing grace! How sweet the sound\nThat saved a wretch like me.\nI once was lost, but now am found,\nWas blind but now I see.\n\nShout, shout for glory,\nShout, shout aloud for glory;\nBrother, sister, mourner,\nAll shout glory hallelujah.<ref name=\"turner115-116\"/>\n</poem>}}\n\nSimultaneously, an unrelated movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds to symbolize the basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound was accompanied by a specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung [[a cappella]].<ref>Turner, p. 117.</ref>\n\n[[File:William Walker, American composer.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Grainy portrait of a middle aged white man in a black suit|[[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]], the composer who first joined John Newton's verses to \"New Britain\", to create the song that has become \"Amazing Grace\"]]\n\n=== \"New Britain\" tune ===\nWhen originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in ''A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns'' (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \"Hephzibah\" by English composer [[John Jenkins Husband (composer)|John Husband]].<ref>[http://hymntune.library.uiuc.edu/ The Hymn Tune Index], Search=\"Hephzibah\".

Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's [[Centre College]], compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \"Gallaher\" and \"St. Mary\" had not.<ref>Turner, pp. 120\u2013122.</ref> As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin.<ref>Turner, p. 123.</ref> A manuscript from 1828 by [[Lucius Chapin]], a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \"St. Mary\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shenandoahharmony.com/2015/did-lucius-chapin-write-the-amazing-grace-tune/|title=Did Lucius Chapin write the Amazing Grace tune?|date=May 12, 2015|author=Rachel Wells Hall}}</ref>\n\n\"Amazing Grace\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \"New Britain\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook ''[[Southern Harmony]]'' in 1847.<ref name=\"hindmarsh11\">Noll and Blumhofer, p. 11.</ref> It was, according to author Steve Turner, a \"marriage made in heaven&nbsp;...

There was a rise at the point of confession, as though the author was stepping out into the open and making a bold declaration, but a corresponding fall when admitting his blindness.\"<ref>Turner, p. 124.</ref> Walker's collection was enormously popular, selling about 600,000 copies all over the U.S. when the total population was just over 20 million. Another shape note tunebook named ''[[The Sacred Harp]]'' (1844) by Georgia residents [[Benjamin Franklin White]] and Elisha J. King became widely influential and continues to be used.<ref name=\"turner126\">Turner, p. 126.</ref>\n\nAnother verse was first recorded in [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s immensely influential 1852 anti-slavery novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.

It was originally one of between 50 and 70 verses of a song titled \"Jerusalem, My Happy Home\" that first appeared in a 1790 book called ''A Collection of Sacred Ballads'':\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nWhen we've been there ten thousand years,\nBright shining as the sun,\nWe've no less days to sing God's praise,\nThan when we first begun.<ref>Aitken, p. 235.</ref><ref>Watson, p. 216.</ref>\n</poem>}}\n\n{{listen\n| filename = Amazing Grace_-_Sacred Harp Singing Society.ogg\n| title = Shape note version of \"Amazing Grace\" recorded by Alan and John Lomax in Birmingham, Alabama, 1942\n| description = This version also includes Newton's sixth verse, which is uncommon in recordings.

Shape note singing communities, with all the members sitting around an open center, each song employing a different director, illustrated this in practice. Simultaneously, the U.S. began to expand westward into previously unexplored territory that was often wilderness. The \"dangers, toils, and snares\" of Newton's lyrics had both literal and figurative meanings for Americans.<ref name=\"turner126\"/> This became poignantly true during the most serious test of American cohesion in the [[U.S. Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). \"Amazing Grace\" set to \"New Britain\" was included in two hymnals distributed to soldiers and with death so real and imminent, religious services in the military became commonplace.<ref>Turner, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref> The hymn was translated into other languages as well: while on the [[Trail of Tears]], the [[Cherokee]] sang Christian hymns as a way of coping with the ongoing tragedy, and a version of the song by [[Samuel Worcester]] that had been translated into the [[Cherokee language]] became very popular.<ref>Duvall, p. 35.</ref><ref>Swiderski, p. 91.</ref>\n\n=== Urban revival ===\nAlthough \"Amazing Grace\" set to \"New Britain\" was popular, other versions existed regionally. [[Primitive Baptist]]s in the Appalachian region often used \"New Britain\" with other hymns, and sometimes sing the words of \"Amazing Grace\" to other folk songs, including titles such as \"[[In the Pines]]\", \"Pisgah\", \"Primrose\", and \"Evan\", as all are able to be sung in common meter, of which the majority of their repertoire consists.<ref>Patterson, p. 137.</ref><ref>Sutton, Brett (January 1982). \"Shape-Note Tune Books and Primitive Hymns\", ''Ethnomusicology'', '''26''' (1), pp. 11\u201326.</ref> A tune named \"Arlington\" accompanied Newton's verses as much as \"New Britain\" for a time in the late 19th century.\n\nTwo musical arrangers named [[Dwight Moody]] and [[Ira Sankey]] heralded another religious revival in the cities of the U.S. and Europe, giving the song international exposure. Moody's preaching and Sankey's musical gifts were significant; their arrangements were the forerunners of [[gospel music]], and churches all over the U.S. were eager to acquire them.<ref>Turner, pp. 133\u2013135.</ref> Moody and Sankey began publishing their compositions in 1875, and \"Amazing Grace\" appeared three times with three different melodies, but they were the first to give it its title; hymns were typically published using the first line of the lyrics, or the name of the tune such as \"New Britain\". A publisher named [[Edwin Othello Excell]] gave the version of \"Amazing Grace\" set to \"New Britain\" immense popularity by publishing it in a series of hymnals that were used in urban churches. Excell altered some of Walker's music, making it more contemporary and European, giving \"New Britain\" some distance from its rural folk-music origins. Excell's version was more palatable for a growing urban middle class and arranged for larger church choirs. Several editions featuring Newton's first three stanzas and the verse previously included by Harriet Beecher Stowe in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' were published by Excell between 1900 and 1910, and his version of \"Amazing Grace\" became the standard form of the song in American churches.<ref>Noll and Blumhofer, p. 13.</ref><ref>Turner, pp. 137\u2013138, 140\u2013145.</ref>\n\n{{listen\n| filename = Amazing grace2.ogg\n| title = \"Amazing Grace\" a cappella, lined out by three singers in long meter\n| description = This recording was done for the ''Archive of American Folk-Song'' in Livingston, Alabama in 1939, and is in the U.S. Library of Congress\n}}\n\n== Recorded versions ==\nWith the advent of recorded music and radio, \"Amazing Grace\" began to cross over from primarily a gospel standard to secular audiences. The ability to record combined with the marketing of records to specific audiences allowed \"Amazing Grace\" to take on thousands of different forms in the 20th century. Where Edwin Othello Excell sought to make the singing of \"Amazing Grace\" uniform throughout thousands of churches, records allowed artists to improvise with the words and music specific to each audience.

Her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her 1970 album ''[[Whales & Nightingales]]''. Collins, who had a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to \"pull her through\" to recovery.<ref name=\"moyers\"/> It was recorded in [[St. Paul's Chapel (Columbia University)|St. Paul's]], the chapel at [[Columbia University]], chosen for the acoustics. She chose an ''a cappella'' arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the Vietnam War, to which she objected: \"I didn't know what else to do about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought&nbsp;... but sing 'Amazing Grace'.\"<ref>Collins, p. 165.</ref> Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested.

The second line, \"That saved a wretch like me!\" has been rewritten as \"That saved and strengthened me\", \"save a soul like me\", or \"that saved and set me free\".<ref>Saunders, William (2003).

Retrieved on February 7, 2010.</ref> [[Kathleen Norris (poet)|Kathleen Norris]] in her book ''Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith'' characterizes this transformation of the original words as \"wretched English\" making the line that replaces the original \"laughably bland\".<ref>Norris, p. 66.</ref> Part of the reason for this change has been the altered interpretations of what wretchedness and grace means. Newton's [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] view of [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] and [[Grace (Christianity)|divine grace]] formed his perspective that he considered himself a sinner so vile that he was [[Total depravity|unable to change his life]] or be redeemed without God's help. Yet his lyrical subtlety, in Steve Turner's opinion, leaves the hymn's meaning open to a variety of Christian and non-Christian interpretations.<ref>Turner, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref> \"Wretch\" also represents a period in Newton's life when he saw himself outcast and miserable, as he was when he was enslaved in Sierra Leone; his own arrogance was matched by how far he had fallen in his life.<ref>Bruner and Ware, pp. 31\u201332.</ref>\n\n[[File:Afghanistan bagpiper.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A Canadian [[bagpipes|bagpiper]] playing \"Amazing Grace\" during a memorial service, October 29, 2009, at Forward Operating Base Wilson, Afghanistan]]\n\nThe communal understanding of redemption and human self-worth has changed since Newton's time. Since the 1970s, self-help books, psychology, and some modern expressions of Christianity have viewed this disparity in terms of grace being an innate quality within all people who must be inspired or strong enough to find it: something to achieve. In contrast to Newton's vision of wretchedness as his willful sin and distance from God, wretchedness has instead come to mean an obstacle of physical, social, or spiritual nature to overcome in order to achieve a state of grace, happiness, or contentment. Since its immense popularity and iconic nature, \"grace\" and the meaning behind the words of \"Amazing Grace\" have become as individual as the singer or listener.<ref>Turner, pp. 218\u2013220.</ref> Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of \"Amazing Grace\" is due to the absence of any mention of God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins \"When we've been there ten thousand years\"), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God. \"Grace\", however, to John Newton had a clearer meaning, as he used the word to represent God or the [[Grace (Christianity)|power of God]].<ref>Noll and Blumhofer, p. 16.</ref>\n\nThe transformative power of the song was investigated by journalist [[Bill Moyers]] in a documentary released in 1990. Moyers was inspired to focus on the song's power after watching a performance at [[Lincoln Center]], where the audience consisted of Christians and non-Christians, and he noticed that it had an equal impact on everybody in attendance, unifying them.<ref name=\"pollock\">Pollock, John (2009). \"Amazing Grace: The great Sea Change in the Life of John Newton\", ''The Trinity Forum Reading'', The Trinity Forum.</ref> James Basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose \"Amazing Grace\" to represent a collection of anti-slavery poetry: \"there is a transformative power that is applicable&nbsp;... : the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace, of suffering into beauty, of alienation into empathy and connection, of the unspeakable into imaginative literature.\"<ref>Basker, p. xxxiv.</ref>\n\nMoyers interviewed Collins, Cash, opera singer [[Jessye Norman]], Appalachian folk musician [[Jean Ritchie]] and her family, white Sacred Harp singers in Georgia, black Sacred Harp singers in Alabama, and a prison choir at the [[Huntsville Unit|Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville]]. Collins, Cash, and Norman were unable to discern if the power of the song came from the music or the lyrics. Norman, who once notably sang it at the end of a large outdoor [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute|rock concert for Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday]], stated, \"I don't know whether it's the text{{snd}} I don't know whether we're talking about the lyrics when we say that it touches so many people{{snd}} or whether it's that tune that everybody knows.\" A prisoner interviewed by Moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse: \"'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved\" by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realized he may never get his life in order, compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison. Gospel singer [[Marion Williams]] summed up its effect: \"That's a song that gets to everybody\".<ref name=\"moyers\"/>\n\nThe ''Dictionary of American Hymnology'' claims it is included in more than a thousand published hymnals, and recommends its use for \"occasions of worship when we need to confess with joy that we are saved by God's grace alone; as a hymn of response to forgiveness of sin or as an assurance of pardon; as a confession of faith or after the sermon\".<ref name=\"dah\"/>\n\n==References==\n'''Explanatory notes'''\n{{notes}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n{{colbegin}}\n* Aitken, Jonathan (2007).

PlayNET licensed their software to a new service, [[Quantum Link]] (Q-Link), who went online in November 1985. PlayNET shut down shortly thereafter. The initial Q-Link service was similar to the original PlayNET, but over time Q-Link added many new services. When a new [[IBM PC]] client was released, the company focussed on the non-gaming services and launched it under the name America Online. The original Q-Link was shut down on November 1, 1995, while AOL grew to become the largest online service, displacing established players like [[CompuServe]] and [[The Source (online service)|The Source]].

The first two require users to sign in but the shortcuts to web pages can be used without authentication.

AOL's use of [[virtual volunteering|remote volunteers]] dated back to the establishment of its [[Quantum Link]] service in 1985.  Most content maintenance was performed by partner and internal employees.  Community leaders were recruited for some content design and maintenance, for which they used a proprietary language and interface called RAINMAN.  Other community leaders hosted chat rooms and provided online help.  During the time that AOL customers paid by the hour, chat room hosts were compensated in free online time for each hour they worked, though any banked hours became worthless once fixed-rate payment was introduced.\n\nTwo former community leaders, Brian Williams of Dallas and Kelly Hallissey of New York filed a class action lawsuit against AOL, citing violations of [[United States labor law|U.S. labor laws]] in its use of community leaders.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States Federal Courthouse, New York City on May 25, 1999, and was followed shortly by the dismissal of all community leaders under the age of 18 years, as well as a reorganization of the community leader program as a whole. The [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] was also investigating AOL's alleged labor law violations, but came to no conclusion, closing their investigation in 2001.<ref name=\"cisn\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Postigo  | first = Hector\n  | title = America Online volunteers\n  | journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies\n  | volume = 12\n  | issue = 5\n  | pages = 451\u2013469\n  | publisher=SAGE Publications\n  | year = 2009\n  | doi = 10.1177/1367877909337858}}</ref>  AOL began drastically reducing the responsibilities and privileges of its volunteers in 2000.  The program was eventually ended on June 8, 2005.  Current Community Leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts in thanks for their service.\n\nWithin one decade of the class action lawsuit being filed, the class had grown to over 6,000 members, comprising the largest class action lawsuit ever filed against an internet based company.  Currently it is the third largest class ever involved in any lawsuit on a federal level in the United States, affecting ultimately the employment eligibility of individuals in an online environment.\n\nIn February 2010, a settlement was approved by the Courts in the class action suit. The settlement included a $15&nbsp;million USD payment. This payment was then divided into thirds, the first of which was attorney and legal fees. Five million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7,000 individual former Community Leaders. The final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by Hallissey and Williams, and then approved by the Courts for distribution.  One such charity, the Remote Area Medical Foundation (www.ramusa.org), received payments in excess of $1.2&nbsp;million USD for the provision of medical services, supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the United States and beyond.\n\nPrior to the 1999 class action lawsuit, the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by AOL.  Community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts, and would no longer be given unlimited access without invoice.  During this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena, Brian Williams of Dallas led many community leaders in a virtual \"strike\" or \"sit-in\" to protest the new charges the community leaders were now being asked to pay.  This protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in: Row 800.  Following the protest, AOL terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the Community Leaders involved.  Quickly following the release of these community leaders, each was reinstated, with the  exception of Williams, due to his role in the protest.  During this time, Williams' role on AOL was that of Guide XNT (Guide Program), CB Naked (Crystal Ball forum), VnV Naked (iVillage's Vices and Virtues Forum) and JCommBrian (Jewish Community Online Forum).\n\n=== Billing disputes ===\nAOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.\n\nAOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General]] in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer [[Consumer complaint|complaints]] filed with the [[Ohio]] AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide [[restitution]] to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the [[Florida Attorney General]].<ref name=\"BBB-AOL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y&compid=2087 |title=AOL |accessdate=January 22, 2008 |publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]] }}</ref>\n\n=== Account cancellation ===\nMany customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to [[Customer retention|retain]] or \"save\" subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or \"save\" half of the people who called to cancel service.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or \"save\" percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum \"save\" rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.\n\nOn August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25&nbsp;million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus.<ref name=\"BBB-AOL\"/> However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York.<ref name=\"pcworld.com\">{{cite web| title= The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time| url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html | first=Dan |last=Tynan | date= May 26, 2006 |publisher= PCWorld |accessdate= April 15, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |title=Cancelling AOL |publisher=insignificantthoughts.com |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101231075933/http://www.insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/| archivedate= December 31, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13447232/ |title=How hard can it be to cancel an AOL account? |first=Jane |last=Wells |publisher=CNBC |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060722035736/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13447232/| archivedate= July 22, 2006 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nOn July 19, 2006, AOL's entire [[Customer retention|retention]] manual was released on the Internet.<ref>Popken, Ben.

AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view, but changed the description to \"Flames and complaints about America Online\". With AOL clients swarming [[Usenet]] newsgroups, the old, existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both AOL and its clients, referring to the new state of affairs as [[Eternal September]].<ref>[http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/pages/chapter03/ch03_.html \"The Making of an Underclass: AOL\"] ''[[net.wars]]'' Chapter 3, Wendy M.

Some users disagree with the TOS, citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the TOS may change without users being made aware.

There is no [[year zero]] in this scheme, so the year AD&nbsp;1 immediately follows the year 1&nbsp;BC.

''{{lang|la|Anno 500}}'' means \"in the year 500\"; ''{{lang|la|anno domini 500}}'' means \"in the year 500 of Our Lord\". Just as \"500 in the year\" is not good English syntax, neither is 500 AD; whereas \"AD 500\" preserves syntactic order when translated.<ref>''Chicago Manual of Style'' 2010, pp. 476\u20137; Goldstein 2007, p. 6.</ref>}} However, BC is placed after the year number (for example: AD&nbsp;{{CURRENTYEAR}}, but 68&nbsp;BC), which also preserves syntactic order. The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a [[century]] or [[millennium]], as in \"fourth century AD\" or \"second millennium AD\" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions).<ref>''Chicago Manual of Style,'' 1993, p. 304.</ref> Because BC is the English abbreviation for ''Before Christ'', it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means ''After Death'', i.e., after the death of Jesus. However, this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would neither be included in the BC nor the AD time scales.<ref>Donald P. Ryan, (2000), 15.</ref>\n\nTerminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or [[Common Era]] (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE). [[Astronomical year numbering]] and [[ISO 8601]] avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years.\n\n== History ==\nThe ''Anno Domini'' dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] to enumerate the years in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. His system was to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian era]] that had been used in an old [[Easter table]] because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecuted Christians]].{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=767}} The last year of the old table, Diocletian 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, AD 532. When he devised his table, [[Julian calendar]] years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year\u2014he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of [[Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]\", which was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161226031734/http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius] Introduction and First Argumentum.</ref> Thus Dionysius implied that [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Jesus' incarnation]] occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred. \"However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, [[Olympiad]], [[Anno Mundi|year of the world]], or [[regnal year]] of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date.\"{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=778}}\n\n[[Bonnie J. Blackburn]] and [[Leofranc Holford-Strevens]] briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] or [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. Among the sources of confusion are:{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778\u20139}}\n* In modern times, [[incarnation]] is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as [[Bede]], considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity.\n* The civil or consular year began on [[1 January]] but the Diocletian year began on 29 August (30 August in the year before a Julian leap year).\n* There were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls.\n* There were confused summations of emperors' regnal years.\n\nIt is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was \"about thirty years old\" shortly after \"the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.<ref>{{cite article|last=Teres|first=Gustav|date=October 1984|title=Time computations and Dionysius Exiguus|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1984JHA....15..177T|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177-188}}</ref><ref>T\u00f8ndering, Claus, ''[http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/years.php The Calendar FAQ: Counting years]''</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&pg=PA347|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|location=Oxford|date=2009|pages=345-347}}</ref>\nIt has also been speculated by Georges Declercq<ref>Declercq, Georges, \"Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era\" Turnhout, Belgium, 2000</ref> that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]. At the time, it was believed by some that the [[resurrection of the dead]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The old ''[[Anno Mundi]]'' calendar theoretically commenced with the [[Dating creation|creation of the world]] based on information in the [[Old Testament]]. It was believed that, based on the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik.

In this same history, he also used another [[Latin]] term, ''ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo'' (\"in fact in the 60th year before the time of the Lord's incarnation\"), equivalent to the English \"before Christ\", to identify years before the first year of this era.<ref>Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence.</ref> Both Dionysius and Bede regarded ''Anno Domini'' as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but \"the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25\" (''Annunciation style'').{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=881}}\n\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Vatican City.

Its endorsement by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] and [[List of Frankish Kings#Carolingian dynasty|his successors]] popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]] ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence.

Bede used the expression ''\"anno igitur ante incarnationem Dominicam\"'' (so in the year before the incarnation of the Lord) twice. ''\"Anno an xpi nativitate\"'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk.<ref>[[Werner Rolevinck]] in ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]'' (1474) used ''Anno an xpi nativitatem'' (in the ...(th) year before the birth of Christ) for all years between [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] and [[Jesus]]. \"xpi\" is the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c7\u03c1\u03b9 in Latin letters, which is an abbreviation for ''Christi''. This phrase appears upside down in the centre of [[recto|recto folios]] (right hand pages). From Jesus to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] he usually used ''Anno Christi'' or its abbreviated form ''Anno xpi'' (on [[verso]] folios\u2014left hand pages). He used ''Anno mundi'' alongside all of these terms for all years.</ref> In 1627, the French [[Jesuit]] [[theologian]] [[Denis P\u00e9tau]] (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work ''De doctrina temporum'', popularized the usage ''ante Christum'' (Latin for \"Before Christ\") to mark years prior to AD.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fsni_qV-FJoC&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q=1627\n|title=Marking time: the epic quest to invent the perfect calendar\n|first=Duncan |last=Steel |authorlink=Duncan Steel\n|page=114\n|accessdate=2010-06-01\n|isbn=978-0-471-29827-4\n|year=2000}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A6nrL1XxpGYC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=petau+%22ante+Christum%22&q=petau%20%22ante%20Christum%22\n|title=Measuring time, making history\n|first=Lynn Avery |last=Hunt\n|year=2008\n|page=33\n|accessdate=2010-06-01\n|isbn=978-963-9776-14-2}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RRv0_NEpl-oC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=petau+%22ante+Christum%22&q=ante%20Christum\n|title=search for \"ante Christum\" in a 1748 reprint of a 1633 abridgement entitled ''Rationarium temporum'' by Denis Petau\n|accessdate=2010-06-01\n|author1=Petau, Denis\n|year=1758}}\n</ref>\n\n===New year===\n{{See|New Year}}\nWhen the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, various people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: [[Christmas]], [[Annunciation]], or [[Easter]]. Thus, depending on the time and place, the year number changed on different days in the year, which created slightly different styles in chronology:<ref>[[C. R. Cheney]], [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99027383.pdf ''A Handbook of Dates, for students of British history''], Cambridge University Press, 1945\u20132000, pp. 8\u201314.</ref>\n* From 25 March 753 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the incarnation of Jesus. That first \"Annunciation style\" appeared in [[Arles]] at the end of the 9th century, then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called ''calculus pisanus'' since it was adopted in [[Pisa]] and survived there till 1750.\n* From 25 December 753 AUC (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the birth of Jesus. It was called \"Nativity style\" and had been spread by Bede together with the ''Anno Domini'' in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the Year of Grace from Christmas was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) until the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style), and in Germany until the second quarter of the 13th century.\n* From 25 March 754 AUC (today in AD 1). That second \"Annunciation style\" may have originated in [[Fleury Abbey]] in the early 11th century, but it was spread by the Cistercians. [[Florence]] adopted that style in opposition to that of Pisa, so it got the name of ''calculus florentinus''. It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1752.\n* From Easter, starting in 754 AUC (AD 1). That ''mos gallicanus'' (French custom) bound to a [[moveable feast]] was introduced in France by king [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] (r. 1180\u20131223), maybe to establish a new style in the provinces reconquered from England. However, it never spread beyond the ruling \u00e9lite.\nWith these various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101.\n\n== Birth date of Jesus ==\n{{see also|Date of birth of Jesus|Nativity of Jesus#Date of birth|Chronology of Jesus#Year of Jesus' birth}}\nThe date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.<ref name=JDG324 >{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}</ref> The historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating,<ref>Doggett 1992, p579: \"Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating\".</ref> but the date is estimated through two different approaches \u2013 one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].<ref name=ChronosPaul >[[Paul L.

Systems in use included [[List of Roman consuls|consular dating]], imperial [[regnal year]] dating, and [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nAlthough the last non-imperial consul, [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius|Basilius]], was appointed in 541 by Emperor [[Justinian I]], later emperors through [[Constans II]] (641\u2013668) were appointed consuls on the first 1 January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for the years of their reign, along with their regnal years.<ref>Roger S. Bagnall and Klaas A. Worp, ''[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/11125 Chronological Systems of Byzantine Egypt]'', Leiden, Brill, 2004.</ref> Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] did so in 888.\n\nAnother calculation had been developed by the [[Alexandria]]n monk [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)\u2014eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], years numbered from it, an ''Era of Incarnation'', were exclusively used and are yet used, in [[Ethiopia]]. This accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]]s. Byzantine chroniclers like [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[George Syncellus]], and [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] dated their years from Annianus' [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world. This era, called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', \"year of the world\" (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used ''Anno Mundi'' years from 1 September 5509 BC, the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Era]]. No single ''Anno Mundi'' epoch was dominant throughout the [[Christian world]]. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' used an era beginning with the birth of [[Abraham]], dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).<ref>Alfred von Gutschmid, ''Kleine Schriften'', F. Ruehl, Leipzig, 1889, p.433.</ref>\n\nSpain and Portugal continued to date by the [[Era of the Caesars]] or [[Spanish Era]], which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Catholic country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.<ref name=CathEncy/>\n\nThe [[Era of Martyrs]], which numbered years from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284, who launched the last yet most severe [[persecution of Christians]], was used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] and is still used, officially, by the Coptic Orthodox and [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] churches. It was also used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] church. Another system was to date from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], which as early as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in some [[Middle Ages|medieval]] manuscripts.\n\n== CE and BCE ==\n{{Main|Common Era}}\nAlternative names for the ''Anno Domini'' era include ''vulgaris aerae'' (found 1615 in Latin),<ref name=VulgarisAerae1 >\n{{cite book\n|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/joannis-keppleri-eclogae-chronicae-ex-epistolis-doctissimorum-aliquot-virorum-suis-mutuis-quibus-examinantur-tempora-nobilissima-1-herodis-herodiadumque-2-baptismi-ministerii-christi-annorum-non-plus-2-14-3-passionis-mortis-et-resurrectionis-dn-n-iesu-christi-anno-aerae-nostrae-vulgaris-31-non-ut-vulgo-33-4-belli-iudaici-quo-funerata-fuit-cum-ierosolymis-templo-synagoga-iudaica-sublatumque-vetus-testamentum-inter-alia-commentarius-in-locum-epiphanii-obscurissimum-de-cyclo-veteri-iudaeorum/oclc/62188677\n|quote=anno aerae nostrae vulgaris\n|author=[[Johannes Kepler]]\n|title=Joannis Keppleri Eclogae chronicae: ex epistolis doctissimorum aliquot virorum & suis mutuis, quibus examinantur tempora nobilissima: 1.
