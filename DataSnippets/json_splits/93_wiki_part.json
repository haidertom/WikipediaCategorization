Internet Standards are created and published by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).\n\nEngineering contributions to the IETF start as an [[Internet Draft]], may be promoted to a [[Request for Comments]], and may eventually become an Internet Standard.\n\nAn Internet Standard is characterized by technical maturity and usefulness. The IETF also defines a '''Proposed Standard''' as a less mature but stable and well-reviewed specification. A '''Draft Standard''' is a third classification that was discontinued in 2011. A Draft Standard was an intermediary step that occurred after a Proposed Standard but prior to an Internet Standard. \n\nAs put in RFC 2026: <blockquote>In general, an Internet Standard is a specification that is stable and well-understood, is technically competent, has multiple, independent, and interoperable implementations with substantial operational experience, enjoys significant public support, and is recognizably useful in some or all parts of the Internet.</blockquote>\n\n==Overview==\nAn Internet Standard is documented by<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huitema|first=C.|last2=Postel|first2=J.|last3=Crocker|first3=S.|date=1995|title=Not All RFCs are Standards|url=https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc1796|issn=2070-1721}}</ref> a [[Request for Comments]] (RFC) or a set of RFCs. A specification that is to become a Standard or part of a Standard begins as an [[Internet Draft]], and is later, usually after several revisions, accepted and published by the [[RFC Editor]] as an RFC and labeled a ''Proposed Standard''. Later, an RFC is elevated as ''Internet Standard'', with an additional sequence number,  when maturity has reached an acceptable level. Collectively, these stages are known as the ''Standards Track'', and are defined in RFC 2026 and RFC 6410. The label ''Historic'' is applied to deprecated Standards Track documents or obsolete RFCs that were published before the Standards Track was established.\n\nOnly the [[IETF Administrative Support Activity|IETF]], represented by the [[Internet Engineering Steering Group]] (IESG), can approve Standards Track RFCs. The definitive list of Internet Standards is maintained in the [http://www.rfc-editor.org/standards Official Internet Protocol Standards]. Previously, STD 1 used to maintain a snapshot of the list.<ref>RFC 7100 Retirement of the \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\" Summary Document</ref>\n\n==Standardization process== \nBecoming a standard is a two-step process within the Internet Standards Process: ''Proposed Standard'' and ''Internet Standard''. These are called ''maturity levels'' and the process is called the ''Standards Track''.\n\nIf an RFC is part of a proposal that is on the Standards Track, then at the first stage, the standard is proposed and subsequently organizations decide whether to implement this Proposed Standard. After the criteria in RFC 6410 is met (two separate implementations, widespread use, no errata etc.), the RFC can advance to Internet Standard.\n\nThe Internet Standards Process is defined in several \"Best Current Practice\" documents, notably [http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp9 BCP 9] ({{As of|2011|alt=currently}} RFC 2026 and RFC 6410). There were previously three standard maturity levels: ''Proposed Standard'', ''Draft Standard'' and ''Internet Standard''. RFC 6410 reduced this to two maturity levels.\n\n===Proposed Standard===\nRFC 2026 originally characterized Proposed Standards as immature specifications, but this stance was annulled by RFC 7127.<ref>{{cite IETF |title=Characterization of Proposed Standards |rfc=7127 |sectionname=Characterization of Specifications |section=3 |year=2014 |month=January |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA ''Proposed Standard'' specification is stable, has resolved known design choices, has received significant community review, and appears to enjoy enough community interest to be considered valuable. Usually, neither implementation nor operational experience is required for the designation of a specification as a Proposed Standard.\n\nProposed Standards are of such quality that implementations can be deployed in the Internet. However, as with all technical specifications, Proposed Standards may be revised if problems are found or better solutions are identified, when experiences with deploying implementations of such technologies at scale is gathered.\n\nMany Proposed Standards are actually deployed on the Internet and used extensively, as stable protocols. Actual practice has been that full progression through the sequence of standards levels is typically quite rare, and most popular IETF protocols remain at Proposed Standard.<ref>{{cite IETF |title=Characterization of Proposed Standards |rfc=7127 |sectionname=IETF Review of Proposed Standards |section=2 |year=2014 |month=January |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Draft Standard===\nIn October 2011, RFC 6410 merged the second and third maturity levels into one Draft Standard. Existing older ''Draft Standards'' retain that classification. The [[Internet Engineering Steering Group|IESG]] can reclassify an old ''Draft Standard'' as ''Proposed Standard'' after two years (October 2013).\n\n===Internet Standard===\nAn Internet Standard is characterized by a high degree of technical maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet community. Generally Internet Standards cover interoperability of systems on the Internet through defining protocols, message formats, schemas, and languages. The most fundamental of the Internet Standards are the ones defining the [[Internet Protocol]].\n\nAn Internet Standard ensures that hardware and software produced by different vendors can work together. Having a standard makes it much easier to develop software and hardware that link different networks because software and hardware can be developed one layer at a time. Normally, the standards used in data communication are called protocols.\n\nAll Internet Standards are given a number in the STD series.  The series was summarized in its first document, STD 1 (RFC 5000), until 2013, but this practice was retired in RFC 7100. The definitive list of Internet Standards is now maintained by the RFC Editor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rfc-editor.org/standards |title=Official Internet Protocol Standards}}</ref>\n\nDocuments submitted to the IETF editor and accepted as an RFC are not revised; if the document has to be changed, it is submitted again and assigned a new RFC number. When an RFC becomes an Internet Standard (STD), it is assigned an STD number but retains its RFC number. When an Internet Standard is updated, its number is unchanged but refers to a different RFC or set of RFCs. For example, in 2007 RFC 3700 was an Internet Standard (STD 1) and in May 2008 it was replaced with RFC 5000. RFC 3700 received ''Historic'' status, and RFC 5000 became STD 1.\n\nThe list of Internet standards in RFC 5000 ends with STD 68 (RFC 5234, <abbr title=\"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications\">ABNF</abbr>) published in 2008.

However, the delays in producing texts, and translating them into other working languages, did not suit the fast pace of change in the telecommunications industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=CCITT - 50 YEARS OF EXCELLENCE - 1956-2006|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/50/docs/ITU-T_50.pdf|publisher=International Telecommunication Union|accessdate=2011-03-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607203152/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/50/docs/ITU-T_50.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-07|df=}}</ref>\n\n== \"Real time\" standardization ==\nThe rise of the [[personal computer]] industry in the early 1980s created a new common practice among both consumers and businesses of adopting \"[[bleeding edge]]\" communications technology even if it was not yet standardized. Thus, [[standards organization]]s had to put forth standards much faster, or find themselves ratifying [[de facto standard]]s after the fact. One of the most prominent examples of this was the [[Open Document Architecture]] project, which began in 1985 when a profusion of software firms around the world were still furiously competing to shape the future of the [[electronic office]], and was completed in 1999 long after [[Microsoft Office]]'s then-secret binary file formats had become established as the global de facto standard.\n\nThe ITU-T now operates under much more streamlined processes. The time between an initial proposal of a draft document by a member company and the final approval of a full-status ITU-T Recommendation can now be as short as a few months (or less in some cases). This makes the standardization approval process in the ITU-T much more responsive to the needs of rapid technology development than in the ITU's historical past.<ref>{{cite web|title=CCITT - 50 YEARS OF EXCELLENCE - 1956-2006|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/50/docs/ITU-T_50.pdf|page=16|publisher=International Telecommunication Union|accessdate=2011-03-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607203152/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/50/docs/ITU-T_50.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-07|df=}}</ref> New and updated Recommendations are published on an almost daily basis, and much of the library of over 3,270 Recommendations is now free of charge online.<ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/group/eng/blog/2007/09/itut_standards_now_freely_avai.html ITU-T Standards now freely available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517063250/http://www.stanford.edu/group/eng/blog/2007/09/itut_standards_now_freely_avai.html |date=2009-05-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-169930353.html|title=Free access for all to ITU-T standards.(ITU)|work=highbeam.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104175124/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-169930353.html|archivedate=2012-11-04|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/Free+Access+For+All+To+ITUT+Standards.aspx|title=ITU-T Newslog - Free access for all to ITU-T standards|work=itu.int|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913031755/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/Free+Access+For+All+To+ITUT+Standards.aspx|archivedate=2010-09-13|df=}}</ref> (Specifications jointly maintained by the ITU-T and ISO/IEC are not free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/publications/Pages/recs.aspx|title=ITU-T Recommendations|work=ITU|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825232058/http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/publications/Pages/recs.aspx|archivedate=2010-08-25|df=}}</ref>)\n\nITU-T has moreover tried to facilitate cooperation between the various forums and standard-developing organizations (SDOs).

This means that an average standard which took around four years to approve and publish until the mid nineties, and two years until 1997, can now be approved in an average of two months, or as little as five weeks.\n\nBesides streamlining the underlying procedures involved in the approval process, an important contributory factor to the use of AAP is electronic document handling. Once the approval process has begun the rest of the process can be completed electronically, in the vast majority of cases, with no further physical meetings.\n\nThe introduction of AAP also formalizes public/private partnership in the approval process by providing equal opportunities for both Sector Members and Member States in the approval of technical standards.\n\nA panel of SG experts drafts a proposal that is then forwarded at a SG meeting to the appropriate body which decides if it is sufficiently ready to be designated a draft text and thus gives its consent for further review at the next level.\n\nAfter this Consent has been given, TSB announces the start of the AAP procedure by posting the draft text to the ITU-T web site and calling for comments. This gives the opportunity for all members to review the text. This phase, called Last Call, is a four-week period in which comments can be submitted by Member States and Sector Members.\n\nIf no comments other than editorial corrections are received, the Recommendation is considered approved since no issues were identified that might need any further work. However, if there are any comments, the SG chairman, in consultation with TSB, sets up a comment resolution process by the concerned experts. The revised text is then posted on the web for an Additional Review period of three weeks.\n\nSimilar to the Last Call phase, in Additional Review the Recommendation is considered as approved if no comments are received. If comments are received, it is apparent that there are some issues that still need more work, and the draft text and all comments are sent to the next Study Group meeting for further discussion and possible approval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/0A/0F/T0A0F0000090001PDFE.pdf|title=itu.int], (s28-29), [http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/e-flash/022-jan06.html ITU-T e-FLASH - Issue No. 22|author=|date=|website=itu.int|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204549/http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/0A/0F/T0A0F0000090001PDFE.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\nThose Recommendations considered as having policy or regulatory implications are approved through what is known as the \u201cTraditional Approval Process\u201d (TAP), which allows a longer period for reflection and commenting by Member States.

When a Recommendation is updated, it will (mostly) keep the same number, so the year of issue may be necessary to identify a specific version of a Recommendation. The term \"X.500\" is used both to refer to the specific X.500 Recommendation, and to the entire family of Recommendations named X.5xx, where the specific X.500 Recommendation forms the introduction and overview of the set.\nThe vast majority of all finalized Recommendations are available in electronic (PDF) form free of charge to all. Texts that are not free of charge include common ITU-T | ISO / IEC texts for which special arrangements exist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/publications/Pages/recs.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825232058/http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/publications/Pages/recs.aspx |archivedate=2010-08-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs) ===\nIn addition to the ITU-T Recommendations, which have non-mandatory status until they are adopted in national laws, ITU-T is also the custodian of a binding international treaty, the International Telecommunication Regulations. The ITRs go back to the earliest days of the ITU when there were two separate treaties, dealing with telegraph and telephone. The ITRs were adopted, as a single treaty, at the World Administrative Telegraphy and Telephone Conference held in Melbourne, 1988 (WATTC-88).<ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/itr/files/ITR-e.doc itu.int] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129123333/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/itr/files/ITR-e.doc |date=2007-11-29 }}</ref>\n\nThe ITRs comprise ten articles which deal, inter alia, with the definition of international telecommunication services, cooperation between countries and national administrations, safety of life and priority of telecommunications and charging and accounting principles. The adoption of the ITRs in 1988 is often taken as the start of the wider liberalization process in international telecommunications, though a few countries, including United States and United Kingdom, had made steps to liberalize their markets before 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/stratpol/ITRs/auth/itr-03.doc|title=itu.int|author=|date=|website=itu.int|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234310/http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/stratpol/ITRs/auth/itr-03.doc|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe Constitution and Convention of ITU provides for the amendment of ITRs through a World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT).

differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|or]] '''internalisation''') has different definitions depending on the field that the term is used in. Internalization is the opposite of [[externalization]]. Generally, internalization describes the psychological outcome of a conscious mind reasoning about a specific subject; the subject is internalized, and the consideration of the subject is internal.\nInternalization of ideals might take place following [[religious conversion]], or in the process of, more generally, [[moral conversion]].<ref name=\"Doran\">{{citation | last=Doran | first=Robert M. | year=2011 | url=http://www.lonerganresource.com/pdf/lectures/What%20Does%20Bernard%20Lonergan%20Mean%20by%20Conversion.pdf | title=Moral Conversion ''from'' and ''to'' | publisher=University of Toronto Press | work=What Does Bernard Lonergan Mean by 'Conversion'? | accessdate=October 7, 2012 | format=PDF file, direct download 61.8 KB | pages=20 }}</ref> Internalization is directly associated with [[learning]] within an organism (or business) and recalling what has been learned.\n\n== Psychology and sociology ==\n{{Main|Internalisation (sociology)}}\nIn sciences such as [[psychology]] and [[sociology]], internalization involves the integration of attitudes, values, standards and the opinions of others into one's own identity or sense of self. In psychoanalytic theory, internalization is a process involving the formation of the super ego.<ref>Corsini, R. (1999). The Dictionary of Psychology, USA: Taylor & Francis.</ref>  Internalization is how man is a product of society. In sociology internalization is the last step. First comes externalization, then comes objectivation, and finally internalization. Many theorists believe that the internalized values of behavior implemented during early socialization are key factors in predicting a child's future moral character. The self-determination theory<ref>Deci, E. L. & Ryan, R. M. (1985). Intrinsic Motivation and Self-Determination in Human Behaviour. New York, N.Y: Plenum Press.</ref> proposes a motivational continuum from the extrinsic to intrinsic motivation and autonomous self-regulation. Some research suggests a child's moral self starts to develop around age three.<ref>Emde, R. N., Biringen, Z., Clyman, R. B. & Oppenheim, D. (1991). The Moral Self of Infancy: Affective Core and Procedural Knowledge. Developmental Review, 11, 251-270.</ref> These early years of socialization may be the underpinnings of moral development in later childhood. Proponents of this theory suggest that children whose view of self is \"good and moral\" tend to have a developmental trajectory toward pro-social behavior and few signs of anti-social behavior.\n\nIn one child developmental study,<ref>Kochanska, G., Koenig, J., Barry, R., Kim, S. & Yoon, J. (2010). Children's Conscience During Toddler and Preschool Years, Moral Self, and a Competent, Adaptive Developmental Trajectory. Developmental Psychology. Vol. 46, No. 5, 1320-1332.</ref> researchers examined two key dimensions of early conscience \u2013 internalization of rules of conduct and empathic affects to others \u2013 as factors that may predict future social, adaptive and competent behavior. Data was collected from a longitudinal study of children, from two parent families, at age 25, 38, 52, 67 and 80 months. Children's internalization of each parent's rules and empathy toward each parent's simulated distress were observed at 25, 38 and 52 months.  Parents and teachers rated their adaptive, competent, pro-social behavior and anti-social behavior at 80 months. The researchers found that first, both the history of the child's early internalization of parental rules and the history of his or her empathy predicted the children's competent and adaptive functioning at 80 months, as rated by parents and teachers. Second, children with stronger histories of internalization of parental rules from 25 to 52 months perceived themselves as more moral at 67 months. Third, the children that showed stronger internalization from 25 to 52 months came to see themselves as more moral and \"good\". These self-perceptions, in turn, predicted the way parents and teachers would rate their competent and adaptive functioning at 80 months.\n\n===As a symptom===\n{{main|Internalizing disorder}}\nIn [[behavioral psychology]], the concept of internalization may also refer to disorders and behaviors in which a person deals with [[stressor]]s in manners not externally evident.  Such disorders and behaviors include [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]], [[bulimia]] and [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chc.2009.03.004| pmid = 19486840| title = Internalizing Disorders in Early Childhood: A Review of Depressive and Anxiety Disorders| journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America| volume = 18| issue = 3| pages = 593\u2013610| year = 2009| last1 = Tandon | first1 = M. | last2 = Cardeli | first2 = E. | last3 = Luby | first3 = J. | pmc=3184300}}</ref>\n\n== Biology ==\nIn sciences such as [[biology]], internalization is another term for [[endocytosis]], in which molecules such as proteins are engulfed by the cell membrane and drawn into the cell.\n\n== Economics and management ==\nIn [[economics]], [[internalization theory]] explains the practice of multinational enterprises (MNEs) to execute transactions within their organization rather than relying on an outside market. It must be cheaper for an MNE to internalize the transfer of its unique ownership advantages between countries than to do so through markets. In other words, the alternative to internalization through direct investment is some form of [[licensing]] of the firm's know-how to a firm in the target economy.\n\n== Finance ==\nIn [[finance]], internalization can refer to several concepts. \"When you place an order to buy or sell a stock, your broker has choices on where to execute your order. Instead of routing your order to a market or market-makers for execution, your broker may fill the order from the firm's own inventory &ndash; this is called 'internalization'. In this way, your broker's firm may make money on the \"spread\" \u2013 which is the difference between the purchase price and the sale price.\"<ref>[https://www.sec.gov/answers/internalization.htm SEC.gov]</ref>  For a related issue regarding trade execution, see [[payment for order flow]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Social influence]]\n* [[Cultural homogenization]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*Meissner, W.

They named it for the indigo blue line in its spectrum.

It is most notably used in the [[semiconductor industry]], in low-melting-point metal [[alloys]] such as [[Solder#Alloying element roles|solders]], in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and in the production of transparent conductive coatings of [[indium tin oxide]] (ITO) on glass.\n\nIndium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream.

Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain [[thallium]], they searched for the green thallium emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because that blue line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals.

(The scarce and fugitive fifth halogen, the radioactive [[astatine]], is not well-studied due to its expense and inaccessibility in large quantities, but appears to show various unusual properties due to [[relativistic effects]].) Iodine has an electron configuration of [Kr]4d<sup>10</sup>5s<sup>2</sup>5p<sup>5</sup>, with the seven electrons in the fifth and outermost shell being its [[valence electron]]s. Like the other halogens, it is one electron short of a full octet and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell, although in keeping with [[periodic trend]]s, it is the weakest oxidising agent among the stable halogens: it has the lowest [[electronegativity]] among them, just 2.66 on the Pauling scale (compare fluorine, chlorine, and bromine at 3.98, 3.16, and 2.96 respectively; astatine continues the trend with an electronegativity of 2.2). Elemental iodine hence forms [[diatomic molecule]]s with chemical formula I<sub>2</sub>, where two iodine atoms share a pair of electrons in order to each achieve a stable octet for themselves; at high temperatures, these diatomic molecules reversibly dissociate a pair of iodine atoms. Similarly, the iodide anion, I<sup>\u2212</sup>, is the strongest reducing agent among the stable halogens, being the most easily oxidised back to diatomic I<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=Greenwood800>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 800\u20134</ref> (Astatine goes further, being indeed unstable as At<sup>\u2212</sup> and readily oxidised to At<sup>0</sup> or At<sup>+</sup>, although the existence of At<sub>2</sub> is not settled.)<ref>{{cite book | series = Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic and Organometallic Chemistry | title = 'At, Astatine', System No. 8a | edition=8th | year = 1985 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | isbn = 3-540-93516-9 | last1 = Kugler | first1 = H.

Iodine conforms to the prevailing trend, being a shiny black crystalline solid that melts at 114&nbsp;\u00b0C and boils at 183&nbsp;\u00b0C to form a violet gas. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group (though astatine may not conform to it, depending on how metallic it turns out to be).<ref name=Greenwood800/> Specifically, the violet colour of iodine gas results from the [[atomic electron transition|electron transition]] between the [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied]] antibonding ''\u03c0<sub>g</sub>'' molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding ''\u03c3<sub>u</sub>'' molecular orbital.<ref name=Greenwood804>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 804\u20139</ref>\n\nElemental iodine is slightly soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450&nbsp;ml at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1280&nbsp;ml at 50&nbsp;\u00b0C; [[potassium iodide]] may be added to increase solubility via formation of [[triiodide]] ions, among other polyiodides.<ref name=Greenwood804/> Nonpolar solvents such as [[hexane]] and [[carbon tetrachloride]] provide a higher solubility.<ref>{{cite book| title = Merck Index of Chemicals and Drugs| edition = 9th| date = 1976| isbn=0-911910-26-3| editor = Windholz, Martha| editor2 = Budavari, Susan| editor3 = Stroumtsos, Lorraine Y.| editor4 = Fertig, Margaret Noether| publisher = J A Majors Company}}</ref> Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as [[Lewis base]]s; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour.<ref name=Greenwood804/> [[Charge-transfer complex]]es form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour.

For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitric oxide]], and [[sulfur dioxide]] (to [[phosgene]], [[nitrosyl chloride]], and [[sulfuryl chloride]] respectively), iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, [[rhenium]] metal reacts with chlorine to form [[rhenium hexachloride]], but with bromine it forms only [[rhenium pentabromide]] and iodine can achieve only [[rhenium tetraiodide]].<ref name=Greenwood800/> By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in [[iodine heptafluoride]].<ref name=Greenwood804/>\n\n===Hydrogen iodide===\nThe simplest compound of iodine is [[hydrogen iodide]], HI. It is a colourless gas that reacts with oxygen to give water and iodine. Although it is useful in [[iodination]] reactions in the laboratory, it does not have large-scale industrial uses, unlike the other hydrogen halides. Commercially, it is usually made by reacting iodine with [[hydrogen sulfide]] or [[hydrazine]]:<ref name=Greenwood809>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 809\u201312</ref>\n:2 I<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> {{overset|H<sub>2</sub>O|\u27f6}} 4 HI + N<sub>2</sub>\nAt room temperature, it is a colourless gas, like all of the hydrogen halides except [[hydrogen fluoride]], since hydrogen cannot form strong [[hydrogen bond]]s to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at \u221251.0&nbsp;\u00b0C and boils at \u221235.1&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is an [[endothermic]] compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a [[catalyst]] is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H\u2013I [[bond dissociation energy]] is likewise the smallest of the hydrogen halides, at 295&nbsp;kJ/mol.<ref name=Greenwood812>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 812\u20139</ref>\n\nAqueous hydrogen iodide is known as [[hydroiodic acid]], which is a strong acid. Hydrogen iodide is exceptionally soluble in water: one litre of water will dissolve 425 litres of hydrogen iodide, and the saturated solution has only four water molecules per molecule of hydrogen iodide.<ref>Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \"Inorganic Chemistry\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.</ref> Commercial so-called \"concentrated\" hydroiodic acid usually contains 48\u201357% HI by mass; the solution forms an [[azeotrope]] with boiling point 126.7&nbsp;\u00b0C at 56.7&nbsp;g HI per 100&nbsp;g solution. Hence hydroiodic acid cannot be concentrated past this point by evaporation of water.<ref name=Greenwood812/>\n\nUnlike [[hydrogen fluoride]], anhydrous liquid hydrogen iodide is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its [[dielectric constant]] is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into H<sub>2</sub>I<sup>+</sup> and {{chem|HI|2|-}} ions \u2013 the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the [[bifluoride]] ions ({{chem|HF|2|-}}) due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and iodine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as [[caesium|Cs<sup>+</sup>]] and [[quaternary ammonium cation|{{chem|NR|4|+}}]] (R = [[methyl group|Me]], [[ethyl group|Et]], [[butyl group|Bu<sup>''n''</sup>]]) may still be isolated. Anhydrous hydrogen iodide is a poor solvent, able to dissolve only small molecular compounds such as nitrosyl chloride and [[phenol]], or salts with very low [[lattice energy|lattice energies]] such as tetraalkylammonium halides.<ref name=Greenwood812/>\n\n===Other binary iodides===\nNearly all elements in the periodic table form binary iodides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the [[noble gas]]es); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond [[bismuth]]); and having an electronegativity higher than iodine's ([[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and the first three halogens), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not iodides but rather oxides, nitrides, or halides of iodine. (Nonetheless, [[nitrogen triiodide]] is named as an iodide as it is analogous to the other nitrogen trihalides.)<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n\nGiven the large size of the iodide anion and iodine's weak oxidising power, high oxidation states are difficult to achieve in binary iodides, the maximum known being in the pentaiodides of [[niobium]], [[tantalum]], and [[protactinium]]. Iodides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydroiodic acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen iodide gas. These methods work best when the iodide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative iodination of the element with iodine or hydrogen iodide, high-temperature iodination of a metal oxide or other halide by iodine, a volatile metal halide, [[carbon tetraiodide]], or an organic iodide. For example, [[molybdenum(IV) oxide]] reacts with [[aluminium(III) iodide]] at 230&nbsp;\u00b0C to give [[molybdenum(II) iodide]]. An example involving halogen exchange is given below, involving the reaction of [[tantalum(V) chloride]] with excess aluminium(III) iodide at 400&nbsp;\u00b0C to give [[tantalum(V) iodide]]:<ref name=Greenwood821>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 821\u20134</ref>\n\n: <chem>3TaCl5 + \\underset{(excess)}{5AlI3} -> 3TaI5 + 5AlCl3</chem>\n\nLower iodides may be produced either through thermal decomposition or disproportionation, or by reducing the higher iodide with hydrogen or a metal, for example:<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n\n: <chem>TaI5{} + Ta ->[\\text{thermal gradient}] [\\ce{630^\\circ C\\ ->\\ 575^\\circ C}] Ta6I14</chem>\n\nMost of the iodides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, along with the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular iodides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Ionic iodides MI<sub>''n''</sub> tend to have the lowest melting and boiling points among the halides MX<sub>''n''</sub> of the same element, because the electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions are weakest for the large iodide anion. In contrast, covalent iodides tend to instead have the highest melting and boiling points among the halides of the same element, since iodine is the most polarisable of the halogens and, having the most electrons among them, can contribute the most to van der Waals forces. Naturally, exceptions abound in intermediate iodides where one trend gives way to the other. Similarly, solubilities in water of predominantly ionic iodides (e.g. [[potassium]] and [[calcium]]) are the greatest among ionic halides of that element, while those of covalent iodides (e.g. [[silver]]) are the lowest of that element. In particular, [[silver iodide]] is very insoluble in water and its formation is often used as a qualitative test for iodine.<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n\n===Iodine halides===\nThe halogens form many binary, [[diamagnetic]] [[interhalogen]] compounds with stoichiometries XY, XY<sub>3</sub>, XY<sub>5</sub>, and XY<sub>7</sub> (where X is heavier than Y), and iodine is no exception. Iodine forms all three possible diatomic interhalogens, a trifluoride and trichloride, as well as a pentafluoride and, exceptionally among the halogens, a heptafluoride. Numerous cationic and anionic derivatives are also characterised, such as the wine-red or bright orange compounds of {{chem|ICl|2|+}} and the dark brown or purplish black compounds of I<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup>. Apart from these, some [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalides]] are also known, such as [[cyanogen iodide]] (ICN), iodine [[thiocyanate]] (ISCN), and iodine [[azide]] (IN<sub>3</sub>).<ref name=Greenwood824>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 824\u20138</ref>\n\n[[File:Iodine monochloride1.jpg|thumb|right|Iodine monochloride]]\n[[Iodine monofluoride]] (IF) is unstable at room temperature and disproportionates very readily and irreversibly to iodine and [[iodine pentafluoride]], and thus cannot be obtained pure. It can be synthesised from the reaction of iodine with fluorine gas in [[trichlorofluoromethane]] at \u221245&nbsp;\u00b0C, with [[iodine trifluoride]] in trichlorofluoromethane at \u221278&nbsp;\u00b0C, or with [[silver(I) fluoride]] at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=Greenwood824/> [[Iodine monochloride]] (ICl) and [[iodine monobromide]] (IBr), on the other hand, are moderately stable. The former, a volatile red-brown compound, was discovered independently by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Humphry Davy]] in 1813\u20134 not long after the discoveries of chlorine and iodine, and it mimics the intermediate halogen bromine so well that [[Justus von Liebig]] was misled into mistaking bromine (which he had found) for iodine monochloride. Iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide may be prepared simply by reacting iodine with chlorine or bromine at room temperature and purified by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallisation]]. Both are quite reactive and attack even [[platinum]] and [[gold]], though not [[boron]], [[carbon]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]], [[zirconium]], [[niobium]], [[molybdenum]], and [[tungsten]]. Their reaction with organic compounds depends on conditions. Iodine chloride vapour tends to chlorinate [[phenol]] and [[salicyclic acid]], since when iodine chloride undergoes homolytic dissociation, chlorine and iodine are produced and the former is more reactive. However, iodine chloride in tetrachloromethane solution results in iodination being the main reaction, since now heterolytic fission of the I\u2013Cl bond occurs and I<sup>+</sup> attacks phenol as an electrophile. However, iodine monobromide tends to brominate phenol even in tetrachloromethane solution because it tends to dissociate into its elements in solution, and bromine is more reactive than iodine.<ref name=Greenwood824/> When liquid, iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide dissociate into {{chem|I|2|X|+}} and {{chem|IX|2|-}} anions (X = Cl, Br); thus they are significant conductors of electricity and can be used as ionising solvents.<ref name=Greenwood824/>\n\n[[Iodine trifluoride]] (IF<sub>3</sub>) is an unstable yellow solid that decomposes above \u221228&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is thus little-known. It is difficult to produce because fluorine gas would tend to oxidise iodine all the way to the pentafluoride; reaction at low temperature with [[xenon difluoride]] is necessary. [[Iodine trichloride]], which exists in the solid state as the planar dimer I<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, is a bright yellow solid, synthesised by reacting iodine with liquid chlorine at \u221280&nbsp;\u00b0C; caution is necessary during purification because it easily dissociates to iodine monochloride and chlorine and hence can act as a strong chlorinating agent. Liquid iodine trichloride conducts electricity, possibly indicating dissociation to {{chem|ICl|2|+}} and {{chem|ICl|4|-}} ions.<ref name=Greenwood828>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 828\u201331</ref>\n\n[[Iodine pentafluoride]] (IF<sub>5</sub>), a colourless, volatile liquid, is the most thermodynamically stable iodine fluoride, and can be made by reacting iodine with fluorine gas at room temperature. It is a fluorinating agent, but is mild enough to store in glass apparatus. Again, slight electrical conductivity is present in the liquid state because of dissociation to {{chem|IF|4|+}} and {{chem|IF|6|-}}. The [[pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry|pentagonal bipyramidal]] [[iodine heptafluoride]] (IF<sub>7</sub>) is an extremely powerful fluorinating agent, behind only [[chlorine trifluoride]], [[chlorine pentafluoride]], and [[bromine pentafluoride]] among the interhalogens: it reacts with almost all the elements even at low temperatures, fluorinates [[Pyrex]] glass to form iodine(VII) oxyfluoride (IOF<sub>5</sub>), and sets carbon monoxide on fire.<ref name=Greenwood832>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 832\u20135</ref>\n\n===Iodine oxides and oxoacids===\n[[File:Iodine-pentoxide-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Structure of iodine pentoxide]]\n[[Iodine oxide]]s are the most stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I\u2013O bonds resulting from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, and they have been known for the longest time.<ref name=King/> The stable, white, [[hygroscopic]] [[iodine pentoxide]] (I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of [[iodic acid]] (HIO<sub>3</sub>), of which it is the anhydride. It will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to [[carbon dioxide]] at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, [[ethylene]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]]. It reacts with [[sulfur trioxide]] and [[peroxydisulfuryl difluoride]] (S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) to form salts of the iodyl cation, [IO<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, and is reduced by concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]s to iodosyl salts involving [IO]<sup>+</sup>. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, [[sulfur tetrafluoride]], or [[chloryl fluoride]], resulting iodine pentafluoride, which also reacts with iodine pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF<sub>3</sub>. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable guesses are I<sup>III</sup>(I<sup>V</sup>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and [IO]<sup>+</sup>[IO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> respectively.<ref name=Greenwood851>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 851\u20133</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-top:0; margin-left:1em; text-align:center; font-size:10pt; line-height:11pt; width:25%;\"\n|+ Standard reduction potentials for aqueous I species<ref name=Greenwood853/>\n! {{nowrap|E\u00b0(couple)}}!!{{nowrap|''a''(H<sup>+</sup>) {{=}} 1}}<br>(acid)!!{{nowrap|E\u00b0(couple)}}!!{{nowrap|''a''(OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) {{=}} 1}}<br>(base)\n|-\n|I<sub>2</sub>/I<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.535|||I<sub>2</sub>/I<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.535\n|-\n|HOI/I<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.987||IO<sup>\u2212</sup>/I<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.48\n|-\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{chem|IO|3|-}}/I<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.26\n|-\n|HOI/I<sub>2</sub>||+1.439||IO<sup>\u2212</sup>/I<sub>2</sub>||+0.42\n|-\n|{{chem|IO|3|-}}/I<sub>2</sub>||+1.195||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n|{{chem|IO|3|-}}/HOI||+1.134||{{chem|IO|3|-}}/IO<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.15\n|-\n|{{chem|IO|4|-}}/{{chem|IO|3|-}}||+1.653||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n|H<sub>5</sub>IO<sub>6</sub>/{{chem|IO|3|-}}||+1.601||{{chem|H|3|IO|6|2-}}/{{chem|IO|3|-}}||+0.65\n|}\nMore important are the four oxoacids: [[hypoiodous acid]] (HIO), [[iodous acid]] (HIO<sub>2</sub>), [[iodic acid]] (HIO<sub>3</sub>), and [[periodic acid]] (HIO<sub>4</sub> or H<sub>5</sub>IO<sub>6</sub>).

Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by [[electrolysis]] or fuming [[nitric acid]]. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.<ref name=Greenwood863>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 863\u20134</ref>\n\nMany periodates are known, including not only the expected tetrahedral {{chem|IO|4|-}}, but also square-pyramidal {{chem|IO|5|3-}}, octahedral orthoperiodate {{chem|IO|6|5-}}, [IO<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup>, [I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>)]<sup>4\u2212</sup>, and {{chem|I|2|O|9|4-}}. They are usually made by oxidising alkaline [[sodium iodate]] electrochemically (with [[lead(IV) oxide]] as the anode) or by chlorine gas:<ref name=Greenwood872>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 872\u20135</ref>\n:{{chem|IO|3|-}} + 6 OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 {{chem|IO|6|5-}} + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n:{{chem|IO|3|-}} + 6 OH<sup>\u2212</sup> + Cl<sub>2</sub> \u2192 {{chem|IO|6|5-}} + 2 Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThey are thermodymically and kinetically powerful oxidising agents, quickly oxidising Mn<sup>2+</sup> to [[permanganate|{{chem|MnO|4|-}}]], and cleaving [[glycol]]s, \u03b1-[[diketone]]s, \u03b1-[[ketol]]s, \u03b1-[[aminoalcohols]], and \u03b1-[[diamine]]s.<ref name=Greenwood872/> Orthoperiodate especially stabilises high oxidation states among metals because of its very high negative charge of \u22125. [[Orthoperiodic acid]], H<sub>5</sub>IO<sub>6</sub>, is stable, and dehydrates at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C in a vacuum to [[metaperiodic acid]], HIO<sub>4</sub>. Attempting to go further does not result in the nonexistent iodine heptoxide (I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), but rather iodine pentoxide and oxygen. Periodic acid may be protonated by [[sulfuric acid]] to give the {{chem|I(OH)|6|+}} cation, isoelectronic to Te(OH)<sub>6</sub> and {{chem|Sb(OH)|6|-}}, and giving salts with bisulfate and sulfate.<ref name=King/>\n\n===Polyiodine compounds===\nWhen iodine dissolves in strong acids, such as fuming sulfuric acid, a bright blue [[paramagnetic]] solution including {{chem|I|2|+}} cations is formed. A solid salt of the diiodine cation may be obtained by oxidising iodine with [[antimony pentafluoride]]:<ref name=King/>\n:2 I<sub>2</sub> + 5 SbF<sub>5</sub> {{overunderset|{{big|\u27f6}}|SO<sub>2</sub>|20\u00b0C}} 2 I<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>F<sub>11</sub> + SbF<sub>3</sub>\nThe salt I<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>F<sub>11</sub> is dark blue, and the blue [[tantalum]] analogue I<sub>2</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>F<sub>11</sub> is also known.

They are often designed in a one-way layout, leading customers counter clockwise along what IKEA calls \"the long natural way\" designed to encourage the customer to see the store in its entirety (as opposed to a traditional retail store, which allows a customer to go directly to the section where the desired goods and services are displayed). There are often shortcuts to other parts of the showroom. Newer IKEA stores, like the one in [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]], [[Germany]], make more use of glass, both for aesthetics and functionality. Skylights are also now common in the self-serve warehouses; natural lighting reduces energy costs, improves worker morale and gives a better impression of the products.\n\n[[File:IKEA Anderlecht self-serve warehouse (DSCF3734).jpg|thumb|The self-service warehouse area]]\n[[File:IKEA Food market in MegaBox 2017.jpg|thumb|Food market]]\nThe sequence first involves going through the furniture showrooms making note of selected items. The customer then collects a shopping cart and proceeds to an open-shelf \"Market Hall\" warehouse for smaller items, then visits the [[self-service]] furniture warehouse to collect previously noted showroom products in [[flat pack]] form. Sometimes, they are directed to collect products from an external warehouse on the same site or at a site nearby after purchase. Finally, customers pay for their products at a cash register.\n\nToday, most stores follow the same layout of having the showroom upstairs with the marketplace and self-service warehouse downstairs. Some stores are single level, while others have separate warehouses to allow more stock to be kept on-site. Single-level stores are found predominantly in areas where the cost of land would be less than the cost of building a 2-level store, such as the [[Saarlouis]], [[Germany]] and [[Haparanda]], Sweden locations. Some stores have dual-level warehouses with machine-controlled silos to allow large quantities of stock to be accessed throughout the selling day.\n\nMost IKEA stores offer an \"as-is\" area at the end of the warehouse, just before the cash registers. Returned, damaged and formerly showcased products are displayed here and sold with a significant discount, but also with a no-returns policy. Most IKEA stores communicate the IKEA policy on environmental issues in this part of the store.  The area, which is painted red, is named according to local customs, in the United Kingdom this is referred to as \"Bargain Corner\", in Sweden \"FYND\" (Bargains) and in Denmark, \"Rodebutikken\" (Rummage boutique).\n\nIKEA uses a sales technique called \"bulla bulla\" in which a bunch of items are purposefully jumbled in bins, to create the impression of volume, and therefore, inexpensiveness.<ref name=TNY /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/house-perfect|title=Is the IKEA Aesthetic Comfy or Creepy?|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref><!-- Web search can't confirm this.

Several smaller store formats have been unsuccessfully tested in the past (the \"midi\" concept in the early '90s, which was tested in Ottawa and Heerlen with {{convert|9,300|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}, or a \"boutique\" shop in Manhattan). A new format for a full-size, city centre store was introduced with the opening of the [[Manchester]] (United Kingdom) store, situated in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] in 2006. Another store, in [[Coventry]] opened in December 2007.  The store has seven floors and a different flow from other IKEA stores. IKEA's [[Southampton]] store which opened in February 2009 is also in the city centre and built in an urban style similar to the Coventry store.  IKEA built these stores in response to UK government restrictions blocking retail establishment outside city centres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/press_room/press_release/national/southampton_opening.html|title=IKEA - press room - press release|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], where shop space is limited and costly, IKEA has opened three outlets in the city, most of which have the one-way layout. They are part of shopping malls, and while being tiny compared to common store design, are huge by Hong Kong standards.\n\nIn 2015, IKEA announced that it would be attempting a smaller store design at several locations in Canada. This modified store will feature only a display gallery and small warehouse. One location planned for [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] is in the place formerly occupied by a [[Sears|Sears Home]] store. The warehouses will not keep furniture stocked, and so customers will not be able to drop in to purchase and leave with furniture the same day. Instead, they will purchase the furniture in advance online or in store and order the furniture delivered to one of the new stores, for a greatly reduced rate. IKEA claims that this new model will allow them to expand quickly into new markets rather than spending years opening a full-size store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/ikea-coming-to-kitchener-1.3332494|title=Ikea coming to Kitchener - Kitchener-Waterloo - CBC News|accessdate=21 Dec 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Products and services==\n===Furniture===\n[[File:IKEA Billy bookshelf (80x106 cm birch veneer).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Billy (bookcase)|Billy]] bookcase]]\n\nRather than being sold pre-assembled, much of IKEA's furniture is designed to be [[Ready-to-assemble furniture|assembled by the customer]]. The company claims that this helps reduce costs and use of packaging by not shipping air; the volume of a bookcase, for example, is considerably less if it is shipped unassembled rather than assembled. This is also more practical for <!-- European --> customers using public transport,  because flat packs can be more easily carried.\n\nIKEA contends that it has been a pioneering force in [[sustainability|sustainable approach]]es to [[Consumerism|mass consumer culture]].<ref>The IKEA Group approach to sustainability, http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_CA/pdf/sustainability_report/group_approach_sustainability_fy11.pdf</ref> Kamprad calls this \"democratic design,\" meaning that the company applies an integrated approach to [[manufacturing]] and design (see also [[environmental design]]). In response to the [[explosion of human population]] and material expectations in the 20th and 21st centuries, the company implements [[economies of scale]], capturing material streams and creating manufacturing processes that hold costs and resource use down, such as the extensive use of [[Medium-density fibreboard|Medium-Density Fiberboard]] (\"MDF\"), also called \"particle board.\" It is an engineered [[wood fibre]] glued under heat and pressure to create a building material of superior strength which is resistant to warp. IKEA uses cabinet-grade and furniture-grade MDF in all of its MDF products, such as PAX wardrobes and kitchen cupboards. IKEA also uses wood, plastic, and other materials for furniture and other products.

Because INGKA Holding is owned by the nonprofit INGKA Foundation, none of this profit is taxed. The foundation's nonprofit status also means that the Kamprad family cannot reap these profits directly, but the Kamprads do collect a portion of IKEA sales profits through the franchising relationship between INGKA Holding and Inter IKEA Systems.\n\nInter IKEA Systems collected \u20ac631 million of [[franchise fee]]s in 2004, but reported pre-tax profits of only \u20ac225 million in 2004. One of the major pre-tax expenses that Inter IKEA systems reported was \u20ac590 million of \"other operating charges\". IKEA has refused to explain these charges, but Inter IKEA Systems appears to make large payments to I.I.

Holding made a profit of \u20ac328 million in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, the Inter IKEA group of companies and I.I.

IKEA was one of a number of companies, including West German firms, which benefited from this practice. The investigation resulted from attempts by former political prisoners to obtain compensation.

Today IWAY is a totally integrated part of IKEA's purchasing model. IWAY covers social, safety and environmental questions. Today IKEA has around 60 IWAY auditors who perform hundreds of supplier audits every year. The main purpose with IWAY is to make sure that the IKEA suppliers follow the law in each country where they are based. Most IKEA suppliers fulfill the law today with exceptions for some special issues, one being excessive working hours in Asia, in countries such as China and India.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[File:IKEA-Tasche.JPG|thumb|left|An IKEA reusable plastic shopping bag]]\nMore recently,{{when|date=May 2016}} IKEA has stopped providing [[plastic bag]]s to customers, but offers [[Reusable shopping bag|reusable bags]] for sale.

For the idea stage, products should be flat-packed so that more items can be shipped at once; products should also be easier to dismantle and recycle. Raw materials are used, and since wood and cotton are two of IKEA's most important manufacturing products, the company works with environmentally friendly forests and cotton, whereby the excessive use of chemicals and water is avoided.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/pdf/reports-downloads/sustainability-strategy-people-and-planet-positive.pdf |title=IKEA Group Sustainability Strategy 2016 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nManufacturing is third in the life cycle and includes IWAY, IKEA's code of conduct for manufacturers and suppliers that formulates and enforces requirements for working conditions, social and environmental standards, and what suppliers can expect from IKEA in return. Marketing is another part of IKEA's life cycle and a portion of the paper used for its catalogues is sourced from responsibly managed forests. The catalogue is also smaller, so that less paper is required, less waste is produced and more catalogues can be shipped per load.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIKEA stores recycle waste and many run on renewable energy with the use of energy-saving bulbs and sensors. All employees are trained in environmental and social responsibility, while public transit is one of the priorities when the location of stores is considered. Also, the coffee and chocolate served at IKEA stores is [[UTZ Certified]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.utz.org/better-business-hub/strengthening-your-reputation/from-store-to-farm-traceability-in-action-at-ikea/ |title=From store to farm \u2013 traceability in action at IKEA - UTZ.org|website=UTZ.org |language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-19}}</ref>\n\nThe last stage of the life cycle is the end of life. Most IKEA stores recycle light bulbs and drained batteries, and the company is also exploring the recycling of sofas and other home furnishing products. According to IKEA's 2012 \"Sustainability Report\", 23% of all wood that the company uses meets the standards of the [[Forest Stewardship Council]], and the report states that IKEA aims to double this percentage by 2017.

Viewers will be directed to a new [[Facebook]] page for the brand, where they are able to vote on who they believe is messier, and submit evidence using videos and photos through an app created especially for the campaign.

A very hard, brittle, silvery-white [[transition metal]] of the [[platinum group]], iridium is the second-densest element (after [[osmium]]) with a density of {{val|22.56|u=g/cm3}} as defined by experimental X-ray crystallography. However at room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure, iridium has a density of {{val|22.65|u=g/cm3}}, {{val|0.04|u=g/cm3}} higher than osmium measured the same way. It is the most [[corrosion]]-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000&nbsp;\u00b0C. Although only certain molten salts and [[halogen]]s are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.\n\nIridium was discovered in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural [[platinum]]. [[Smithson Tennant]], the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium is [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|one of the rarest elements]] in [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]], with annual production and consumption of only three [[tonne]]s. <sup>191</sup>Ir and <sup>193</sup>Ir are the only two naturally occurring [[isotope]]s of iridium, as well as the only [[stable isotope]]s; the latter is the more abundant of the two.\n\nThe most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with [[chlorine]], though iridium also forms a number of [[organometallic compound]]s used in industrial [[catalysis]], and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-performance [[spark plug]]s, [[crucible]]s for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the [[chloralkali process]]. Iridium radioisotopes are used in some [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s.\n\nIridium is found in meteorites in much higher abundance than in the Earth's crust.<ref name=\"Becker2002\">{{cite journal | first1=Luann | last1=Becker | url=http://www.miracosta.edu/home/kmeldahl/articles/blows.pdf | title=Repeated Blows | accessdate=January 19, 2016 | journal=Scientific American | year=2002 | volume=286 | issue=3 | pages=77\u201383| bibcode=2002SciAm.286c..76B | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0302-76 }}</ref> For this reason, the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] gave rise to the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 66&nbsp;million years ago]]. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the [[Pacific Ocean]] suggested the [[Eltanin impact]] of about 2.5 million years ago.\n\nIt is thought that the total amount of iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that observed in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and [[Goldschmidt classification#Siderophile elements|tendency]] of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Physical properties===\n[[File:iridium2.jpg|left|thumb|One [[troy ounce]] (31.1035&nbsp;g) of arc-melted iridium|alt=A flattened drop of dark gray substance]]\nA member of the [[platinum group]] [[metal]]s, iridium is white, resembling [[platinum]], but with a slight yellowish cast.

It was devised by the [[International Phonetic Association]] in the late [[19th century]] as a standardized representation of the sounds of [[spoken language]].<ref name=\"IPA 1999\">International Phonetic Association (IPA), ''Handbook''.</ref> The IPA is used by [[lexicography|lexicographers]], [[foreign language]] students and teachers, [[linguistics|linguists]], [[speech-language pathology|speech-language pathologists]], [[singing|singers]], [[actor]]s, [[constructed language]] creators and [[translation|translators]].<ref name=\"world\">{{Cite book|last=MacMahon|first=Michael K.

For example, the sound of the English letter {{angbr|t}} may be transcribed in IPA with a single letter, {{IPA|[t]}}, or with a letter plus diacritics, {{IPA|[t\u033a\u02b0]}}, depending on how precise one wishes to be.<ref group=note>The inverted bridge under the {{angbr|t}} specifies it as [[apical consonant|apical]] (pronounced with the tip of the tongue), and the superscript ''h'' shows that it is [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] (breathy). Both these qualities cause the English {{IPA|[t]}} to sound different from the French or Spanish {{IPA|[t]}}, which is a [[laminal consonant|laminal]] (pronounced with the blade of the tongue) and unaspirated {{IPA|[t\u033b]}}. {{angbr|{{IPA|t\u033a\u02b0}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|t\u033b}}}} are thus two different IPA symbols for two different, though similar, sounds.</ref> Often, slashes are used to signal [[phonetic transcription#Narrow versus broad transcription|broad or phonemic transcription]]; thus, {{IPA|/t/}} is less specific than, and could refer to, either {{IPA|[t\u033a\u02b0]}} or {{IPA|[t]}}, depending on the context and language.\n\nOccasionally letters or diacritics are added, removed or modified by the International Phonetic Association. As of the most recent change in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html |title=IPA: Alphabet |publisher=Langsci.ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=20 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010121927/http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html |archivedate=10 October 2012 }}</ref> there are 107 letters, 52 diacritics and four [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] marks in the IPA.

It was developed by [[Alexander John Ellis]], [[Henry Sweet]], [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones]], and Passy.<ref>IPA in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref>\n\nSince its creation, the IPA has undergone a number of revisions. After revisions and expansions from the 1890s to the 1940s, the IPA remained primarily unchanged until the [[Kiel Convention]] in 1989. A minor revision took place in 1993 with the addition of four letters for [[mid central vowel]]s<ref name=\"world\" /> and the removal of letters for [[implosive consonant#Voiceless implosives|voiceless implosives]].<ref name=Pullum>Pullum and Ladusaw, ''Phonetic Symbol Guide'', pp.&nbsp;152, 209</ref> The alphabet was last revised in May 2005 with the addition of a letter for a [[labiodental flap]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Nicolaidis |first=Katerina |title=Approval of New IPA Sound: The Labiodental Flap |url=http://www2.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/flap.htm |date=September 2005 |publisher=International Phonetic Association |accessdate=17 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902212308/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ipa/flap.htm |archivedate=2 September 2006  }}</ref> Apart from the addition and removal of symbols, changes to the IPA have consisted largely of renaming symbols and categories and in modifying typefaces.<ref name=\"world\" />\n\n[[Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet]] for speech pathology were created in 1990 and officially adopted by the [[International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics Association]] in 1994.<ref>International Phonetic Association, ''Handbook'', p.&nbsp;186</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:IPA chart 2018.pdf|thumb|upright=1.5|The official chart of the IPA as of 2018]]\n\nThe general principle of the IPA is to provide one letter for each distinctive sound ([[segment (linguistics)|speech segment]]), although this practice is not followed if the sound itself is complex.<ref>\u201cFrom its earliest days...the International Phonetic Association has aimed to provide \u2018a separate sign for each distinctive sound; that is, for each sound which, being used instead of another, in the same language, can change the meaning of a word\u2019.\u201d (International Phonetic Association, ''Handbook'', p.&nbsp;27)</ref> This means that:\n* It does not normally use [[multigraph (orthography)|combinations of letters]] to represent single sounds, the way [[English language|English]] does with {{angbr|sh}}, {{angbr|th}} and {{angbr|ng}}, or single letters to represent multiple sounds the way {{angbr|x}} represents {{IPA|/ks/}} or {{IPA|/\u0261z/}} in English.\n* There are no letters that have context-dependent sound values, as do \"hard\" and \"soft\" [[hard and soft C|{{angbr|c}}]] or [[hard and soft G|{{angbr|g}}]] in several European languages.\n* The IPA does not usually have separate letters for two sounds if no known language makes a distinction between them, a property known as \"selectiveness\".<ref name=\"world\"/><ref group=note>\nFor instance, [[flap consonant|flaps and taps]] are two different kinds of [[Manner of articulation|articulation]], but since no language has (yet) been found to make a distinction between, say, an [[alveolar tap|alveolar flap]] and an alveolar tap, the IPA does not provide such sounds with dedicated letters. Instead, it provides a single letter (in this case,&nbsp;{{IPA|[\u027e]}}) for both. Strictly speaking, this makes the IPA a partially [[phonemic|phon''em''ic]] alphabet, not a purely [[phonetic|phon''et''ic]] one.\n</ref>\n\nAmong the symbols of the IPA, 107 letters represent [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s, 31 [[diacritic]]s are used to modify these, and 19 additional signs indicate [[Segment (linguistics)|suprasegmental]] qualities such as [[length (phonetics)|length]], [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].<ref group=note>\nThere are five basic tone diacritics and five basic tone letters, both sets of which are compounded for contour tones.\n</ref> These are organized into a chart; the chart displayed here is the\n[http://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/content/ipa-chart official chart] as posted at the website of the IPA.\n\n===Letter forms===\nThe letters chosen for the IPA are meant to harmonize with the [[Latin alphabet]].<ref group=note>\n\"The non-roman letters of the International Phonetic Alphabet have been designed as far as possible to harmonize well with the roman letters. The Association does not recognize makeshift letters; It recognizes only letters which have been carefully cut so as to be in harmony with the other letters.\" (IPA 1949)\n</ref> For this reason, most letters are either [[Latin script|Latin]] or [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], or modifications thereof. Some letters are neither: for example, the letter denoting the [[glottal stop]], {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0294}}}}, has the form of a dotless [[question mark]], and derives originally from an [[apostrophe]].  A few letters, such as that of the voiced [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal fricative]], {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0295}}}}, were inspired by other writing systems (in this case, the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] letter {{rtl-lang|ar|[[Ayin|\ufec9]]}} ''{{transl|ar|\u2018ain}}'').<ref name=Pullum/>\n<!--clearly, \u0294 and \u0295 are not of independent origin and reflect the transliteration of alif vs. ayin in Semitic philology. Source needed-->\n\nDespite its preference for harmonizing with the Latin script, the International Phonetic Association has occasionally admitted other letters. For example, before 1989, the IPA letters for [[click consonant]]s were {{angbr|{{IPA|[[Bilabial click|\u0298]]}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|[[Dental click|\u0287]]}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|[[Alveolar click|\u0297]]}}}}, and {{angbr|{{IPA|[[Lateral click|\u0296]]}}}}, all of which were derived either from existing IPA letters, or from Latin and Greek letters. However, except for {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0298}}}}, none of these letters were widely used among [[Khoisan languages|Khoisanists]] or [[Bantu languages|Bantuists]], and as a result they were replaced by the more widespread symbols {{angbr|{{IPA|[[Bilabial click|\u0298]]}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|[[Dental click|\u01c0]]}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|[[Alveolar click|\u01c3]]}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|[[Palatal click|\u01c2]]}}}}, and {{angbr|{{IPA|[[Lateral click|\u01c1]]}}}} at the IPA Kiel Convention in 1989.<ref>Laver, ''Principles of Phonetics'', pp.&nbsp;174\u2013175</ref>\n\nAlthough the IPA diacritics are fully [[Featural alphabet|featural]], there is little systemicity in the letter forms. A [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] articulation is consistently indicated with a right-swinging tail, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0256 \u0282 \u0273}}}}, and [[glottalic ingressive|implosion]] by a top hook, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0253 \u0257 \u0260}}}}, but other pseudo-featural elements are due to haphazard derivation and coincidence. For example, all nasal consonants but uvular {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0274}}}} are based on the form {{angbr|{{IPA|n}}}}: {{angbr|{{IPA|m \u0271 n \u0273 \u0272 \u014b}}}}. However, the similarity between {{angbr|{{IPA|m}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|n}}}} is a historical accident; {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0272}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|\u014b}}}} are derived from [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]] of ''gn'' and ''ng,'' and {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0271}}}} is an ''ad hoc'' imitation of {{angbr|{{IPA|\u014b}}}}.\n\nSome of the new letters were ordinary Latin letters turned 180 degrees, such as {{IPA|\u0250 \u0254 \u0259 \u025f \u0265 \u026f \u0279 \u0287 \u028c \u028d \u028e}} (turned {{IPA|a c e f h m r t v w y}}). This was easily done in the era of [[Hot metal typesetting|mechanical typesetting]], and had the advantage of not requiring the casting of special type for IPA symbols.\n\n====Capital letters====\nFull capital letters are not used as IPA symbols. They are, however, often used for [[archiphoneme]]s and for natural classes of phonemes (that is, as wildcards). Such usage is not part of the IPA or even standardized, and may be ambiguous between authors, but it is commonly used in conjunction with the IPA. (The [[extIPA]] chart, for example, uses wildcards in its illustrations.) Capital letters are also basic to the [[Voice Quality Symbols]] sometimes used in conjunction with the IPA.\n\nAs wildcards, {{IPA|C}} for {consonant} and {{IPA|V}} for {vowel} are ubiquitous. Other common capital-letter symbols are {{IPA|T}} for {tone/accent} (tonicity), {{IPA|N}} for {nasal}, {{IPA|P}} for {plosive}, {{IPA|F}} for {fricative}, {{IPA|S}} for {sibilant}, {{IPA|G}} for {glide/approximant}, {{IPA|L}} for {liquid}, {{IPA|R}} for {rhotic} or {resonant}, {{IPA|\ua7b0}} for {click}, {{IPA|A, E, O, \u0244}} for {open, front, back, close vowel} and {{IPA|B, D, J or \u0248, K, Q, \u03a6, H}} for {labial}, {alveolar}, {post-alveolar/palatal}, {velar}, {uvular}, {pharyngeal} and {glottal}, respectively, and  {{IPA|X}} for anything. For example, the possible syllable shapes of Mandarin can be abstracted as ranging from {{IPA|V}} (atonic vowel) to {{IPA|CVN\u1d40}} (consonant-vowel-nasal syllable with tone). The letters can be modified with IPA diacritics, for example {{IPA|C\u02bc}} for {ejective}, {{IPA|\u0187}} for {implosive}, {{IPA|N\u0361C}} or {{IPA|\u1d3aC}} for {prenasalized consonant}, {{IPA|\u1e7c}} for {[[nasal vowel]]}, {{IPA|S\u032c}} for {voiced sibilant}, {{IPA|N\u0325}} for {voiceless nasal}, {{IPA|P\u0361F}} or {{IPA|P<sup>F</sup>}} for {affricate}, {{IPA|C\u02b2}} for {palatalized consonant} and {{IPA|D\u032a}} for {dental consonant}. In speech pathology, capital letters represent indeterminate sounds, and may be superscripted to indicate they are weakly articulated: e.g. {{IPA|\u1d30}} is a weak indeterminate alveolar, {{IPA|\u1d37}} a weak indeterminate velar.<ref>Perry (2000) ''Phonological/phonetic assessment of an English-speaking adult with dysarthria''</ref>\n\nTypical examples of archiphonemic use of capital letters are I for the Turkish harmonic vowel set {{IPA|{i y \u026f u}}} and D for the conflated flapped middle consonant of American English ''writer'' and ''rider''.\n\nV, F and C have different meanings as [[Voice Quality Symbols]], where they stand for \"voice\", \"falsetto\" and \"creak\". They may take diacritics that indicate what kind of voice quality an utterance has, and may be used to extract a suprasegmental feature that occurs on all susceptible segments in a stretch of IPA. For instance, the transcription of [[Scottish Gaelic]] {{IPA|[k\u02b7\u02b0u\u02e3\u02b7t\u032a\u02b7s\u031f\u02b7]}} 'cat' and {{IPA|[k\u02b7\u02b0\u0289\u02e3\u02b7t\u035c\u0283\u02b7]}} 'cats' ([[Islay]] dialect) can be made more economical by extracting the suprasegmental labialization of the words: {{IPA|V\u02b7[k\u02b0u\u02e3t\u032as\u031f]}} and  {{IPA|V\u02b7[k\u02b0\u0289\u02e3t\u035c\u0283]}}.<ref>Laver (1994) ''Principles of Phonetics'', p. 374.</ref>\n\n===Typography and iconicity===\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet, using as few non-Latin forms as possible.<ref name = IPA194-196 /> The Association created the IPA so that the sound values of most [[consonant]] letters taken from the Latin alphabet would correspond to \"international usage\".<ref name=IPA194-196/> Hence, the letters {{angbr|{{IPA|b}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|d}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|f}}}}, ([[hard G|hard]]) {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0261}}}}, (non-silent) {{angbr|{{IPA|h}}}}, (unaspirated) {{angbr|{{IPA|k}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|l}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|m}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|n}}}}, (unaspirated) {{angbr|{{IPA|p}}}}, (voiceless) {{angbr|{{IPA|s}}}}, (unaspirated) {{angbr|{{IPA|t}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|v}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|w}}}}, and {{angbr|{{IPA|z}}}} have the values used in English; and the [[vowel]] letters from the Latin alphabet ({{angbr|{{IPA|a}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|e}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|i}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|o}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|u}}}}) correspond to the (long) sound values of Latin: {{IPA|[i]}} is like the vowel in ''mach{{strong|i}}ne'', {{IPA|[u]}} is as in ''r{{strong|u}}le'', etc. Other letters may differ from English, but are used with these values in other European languages, such as {{angbr|{{IPA|j}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|r}}}}, and {{angbr|{{IPA|y}}}}.\n\nThis inventory was extended by using small-capital and cursive forms, diacritics and rotation. There are also several symbols derived or taken from the Greek alphabet, though the sound values may differ. For example, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u028b}}}} is a vowel in Greek, but an only indirectly related consonant in the IPA.  For most of these, subtly different [[glyph]] shapes have been devised for the IPA, namely {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0251}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|\ua7b5}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0263}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u025b}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0278}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|\uab53}}}}, and {{angbr|{{IPA|\u028b}}}}, which are encoded in [[Unicode]] separately from their parent Greek letters, though one of them \u2013 {{angbr|{{IPA|\u03b8}}}} \u2013 is not, while Greek {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u03b2}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u03c7}}}} are generally used for {{angbr|{{IPA|\ua7b5}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|\uab53}}}}.<ref>Cf. the notes at the Unicode [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0250.pdf#3 IPA EXTENSIONS code chart] as well as blogs by [http://evertype.com/blog/blog/category/unicode/ Michael Everson] and John Wells [http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2010/07/disunification-1.html here] and [http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2010/07/disunification-2.html here].</ref>\n\nThe sound values of modified Latin letters can often be derived from those of the original letters.<ref>{{Citation | quote = The new letters should be suggestive of the sounds they represent, by their resemblance to the old ones. | publisher = International Phonetic Association | title = Handbook | page = 196}}.</ref> For example, letters with a rightward-facing hook at the bottom represent [[retroflex consonant]]s; and small capital letters usually represent [[uvular consonant]]s. Apart from the fact that certain kinds of modification to the shape of a letter generally correspond to certain kinds of modification to the sound represented, there is no way to deduce the sound represented by a symbol from its shape (as for example in [[Visible Speech]]) nor even any systematic relation between signs and the sounds they represent (as in [[Hangul]]).\n\nBeyond the letters themselves, there are a variety of secondary symbols which aid in transcription. [[Diacritic|Diacritic marks]] can be combined with IPA letters to transcribe modified [[phonetics|phonetic]] values or [[secondary articulation]]s. There are also special symbols for [[Prosody (linguistics)|suprasegmental features]] such as [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] that are often employed.\n\n===Types of transcription===\nThere are two principal types of [[bracket]]s used to set off IPA transcriptions:\n* [square brackets] are used with [[phonetic]] notations, possibly including details of the pronunciation that may not be used for distinguishing words in the language being transcribed, but which the author nonetheless wishes to document.\n* /[[slash (punctuation)|slashes]]/ are used for [[phonemic]] notations, which note only features that are distinctive in the language, without any extraneous detail.\nFor example, while the {{IPA|/p/}} sounds of ''pin'' and ''spin'' are pronounced slightly differently in English (and this difference would be meaningful in some languages), the difference is not meaningful in English. Thus ''phonemically'' the words are {{IPA|/p\u026an/}} and {{IPA|/sp\u026an/}}, with the same {{IPA|/p/}} phoneme. However, to capture the difference between them (the [[allophone]]s of {{IPA|/p/}}), they can be transcribed phonetically as {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u026an]}} and {{IPA|[sp\u026an]}}.\n\nOther conventions are less commonly seen:\n* Double slashes //...//, <nowiki>pipes |...|, double pipes ||...||,</nowiki> or braces {...} may be used around a word to denote its underlying structure, more abstract even than that of phonemes. {{selfref|See [[morphophonology]] for examples.|inline}}\n* Double square brackets {{IPA|\u27e6...\u27e7}} are used for extra-precise transcription. They indicate that a letter has its cardinal IPA value. For example, {{IPA|\u27e6a\u27e7}} is an open front vowel, rather than the perhaps slightly different value (such as open central) that \"{{IPA|[a]}}\" may be used to transcribe in a particular language. Thus two vowels transcribed for easy legibility as {{angle bracket|{{IPA|[e]}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|[\u025b]}}}} may be clarified as actually being {{IPA|\u27e6e\u031d\u27e7}} and {{IPA|\u27e6e\u27e7}}; {{angle bracket|{{IPA|[\u00f0]}}}} may be more precisely {{IPA|\u27e6\u00f0\u0320\u031e\u02e0\u27e7}}.<ref>Basb\u00f8ll (2005) ''The Phonology of Danish'' pp. 45, 59</ref>\n* Angle brackets are used to clarify that the letters represent the original orthography of the language, or sometimes an exact transliteration of a non-Latin script, not the IPA; or, within the IPA, that the letters themselves are indicated, not the sound values that they carry. For example, {{angbr|{{IPA|pin}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|spin}}}} would be seen for those words, which do not contain the ''ee'' sound {{IPA|[i]}} of the IPA letter {{angbr|{{IPA|i}}}}. Italics are perhaps more commonly used for this purpose when full words are being written (as ''pin, spin'' above), but may not be sufficiently clear for individual letters and digraphs.<ref>Proper angle brackets used in transcription are the mathematical symbols \u27e8...\u27e9 (U+27E8 and U+27E9). These may not be supported by older fonts. Chevrons \u2039...\u203a (U+2039, U+203A) are sometimes substituted, as are the less-than and greater-than signs <...> (U+003C, U+003E) found on ASCII keyboards.</ref>\n* {[[Bracket#Curly brackets|Braces]]} are used for [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] notation.

After each modification, the Association provides an updated simplified presentation of the alphabet in the form of a chart. (See [[History of the International Phonetic Alphabet|History of the IPA]].)  Not all aspects of the alphabet can be accommodated in a chart of the size published by the IPA.  The [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] and [[epiglottal consonant|epiglottal]] consonants, for example, are not included in the consonant chart for reasons of space rather than of theory (two additional columns would be required, one between the retroflex and palatal columns and the other between the pharyngeal and glottal columns), and the [[lateral flap]] would require an additional row for that single consonant, so they are listed instead under the catchall block of \"other symbols\".<ref>John Esling (2010) \"Phonetic Notation\", in Hardcastle, Laver & Gibbon (eds) ''The Handbook of Phonetic Sciences'', 2nd ed., p 688, 693.</ref>  The indefinitely large number of [[Chao tone letter|tone letters]] would make a full accounting impractical even on a larger page, and only a few examples are shown.\n\nThe procedure for modifying the alphabet or the chart is to propose the change in the ''[[Journal of the International Phonetic Association|Journal of the IPA]].''

Nonetheless, many users of the alphabet, including the leadership of the Association itself, make personal changes or additions in their own practice, either for convenience in working on a particular language (see \"Illustrations of the IPA\" for individual languages in the ''Handbook'', which for example may use {{angbr|c}} for {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}),<ref>''IPA Handbook'' (1999)</ref> or because they object to some aspect of the official version.\n\n==Usage==\n{{further|Phonetic transcription}}\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 240\n| footer = A ''broad transcription'' of [[XKCD]] #739 in IPA notation\n| image1 = Malamanteau.png\n| caption1 =\n| image2 = XKCD_Malamanteau_IPA_transcription.png\n| caption2 =\n}}\nAlthough the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a relatively small subset of these will be used to transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a ''narrow transcription''. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a ''broad transcription.'' Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets.<ref name=\"IPA 1999\"/> Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.\n[[File:RPGA international.svg|200px|thumb|Phonetic transcriptions of the word ''[[international]]'' in two [[English dialect]]s]]\n\nFor example, the English word ''little'' may be transcribed broadly using the IPA as {{IPA|/\u02c8l\u026at\u0259l/}}, and this broad (imprecise) transcription is a more or less accurate description of many pronunciations. A narrower transcription may focus on individual or dialectical details: {{IPA|[\u02c8\u026b\u026a\u027e\u026b]}} in [[General American]], {{IPA|[\u02c8l\u026a\u0294o]}} in [[Cockney]], or {{IPA|[\u02c8\u026b\u026a\u02d0\u026b]}} in Southern US English.\n\nIt is customary to use simpler letters, without many diacritics, in phonemic transcriptions. The choice of IPA letters may reflect the theoretical claims of the author, or merely be a convenience for typesetting. For instance, in English, either the vowel of ''pick'' or the vowel of ''peak'' may be transcribed as {{IPA|/i/}} (for the pairs {{IPA|/pik, pi\u02d0k/}} or {{IPA|/p\u026ak, pik/}}), and neither is identical to the vowel of the French word ''{{lang|fr|pique}}'' which is also generally transcribed {{IPA|/i/}}. That is, letters between slashes do not have absolute values, something true of broader phonetic approximations as well. A narrow transcription may, however, be used to distinguish them: {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u026ak]}}, {{IPA|[p\u02b0i\u02d0k]}}, {{IPA|[pik\u02b2]}}.\n\n===Linguists===\nAlthough IPA is popular for transcription by linguists, American linguists often alternate use of the IPA with [[Americanist phonetic notation]] or use the IPA together with some [[Obsolete and nonstandard symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet|nonstandard symbols]], for reasons including reducing the error rate on reading handwritten transcriptions or avoiding perceived awkwardness of IPA in some situations.  The exact practice may vary somewhat between languages and even individual researchers, so authors are generally encouraged to include a chart or other explanation of their choices.<ref name=\"thomason\">{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005287.html |title=Why I Don't Love the International Phonetic Alphabet |author=Sally Thomason |date=2 January 2008 |work=Language Log }}</ref>\n\n===Language study===\n\n[[File:English-2nd grade-Vereshchagina-Russian-textbook-page 39.png|thumb|right|300px|A page from an English language textbook used in [[Russia]]. The IPA is used to teach the different pronunciations of the [[Th (digraph)|digraph {{angbr|th}}]] ({{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}) and to show the pronunciation of newly introduced words ''polite'', ''everything'', ''always'', ''forget''.]]\nSome language study programs use the IPA to teach pronunciation. For example, in Russia (and earlier in the Soviet Union) and [[mainland China]], textbooks for children<ref>For example, the English school textbooks by I. N. Vereshagina, K. A. Bondarenko and T. A. Pritykina.</ref> and adults<ref>For example, \"Le Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de tous\" by K. K. Parchevsky and E. B. Roisenblit (1995) and \"English Through Eye and Ear\" by L.V. Bankevich (1975).</ref> for studying English and French consistently use the IPA. English teachers and textbooks in Taiwan tend to use the Kenyon and Knott system, a slight typographical variant of the IPA first used in the 1944 ''[[A Pronouncing Dictionary of American English|Pronouncing Dictionary of American English]]''\n\n===Dictionaries===\n\n====English====\nMany British dictionaries, including the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and some [[Monolingual learner's dictionary|learner's dictionaries]] such as the ''[[Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]'', now use [[Pronunciation respelling for English#International Phonetic Alphabet|the International Phonetic Alphabet]] to represent the pronunciation of words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/help/phonetics.htm |title=Phonetics |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|accessdate=11 March 2007}}</ref> However, most American (and some British) volumes use one of a variety of [[Pronunciation respelling for English|pronunciation respelling]] systems, intended to be more comfortable for readers of English. For example, the respelling systems in many American dictionaries (such as ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary|Merriam-Webster]]'') use {{angbr|y}} for IPA {{IPA|[j]}} and {{angbr|sh}} for IPA {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, reflecting common representations of those sounds in written English,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/pronsymbols.html |title=Merriam-Webster Online Pronunciation Symbols |accessdate=4 June 2007 |work= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601152219/http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/pronsymbols.html |archive-date=1 June 2007 |dead-url=yes  }}<br />{{Cite book|first=Michael |last=Agnes|title=Webster's New World College Dictionary|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan |location=New York|isbn=0-02-863119-6|page=xxiii|nopp=true}}<br />''[[Pronunciation respelling for English]]'' has detailed comparisons.</ref> using only letters of the English [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]] and variations of them.

The IPA can just as easily be used for this. :\nOne of the benefits of using an alternative to the IPA is the ability to use a single letter for a sound pronounced differently in different dialects. For example, [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] uses {{angbr|\u014f}} for the vowel in ''cot'' [http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/C0674600.html (k\u014ft)] but {{angbr|\u00f4}} for the one in ''caught'' [http://www.bartleby.com/61/14/C0171400.html (k\u00f4t)].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pronunciation Key|work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/12.html |year=2000 |publisher=Bartleby.com|accessdate=19 September 2006 }}</ref> Some American speakers [[phonological history of English low back vowels|pronounce these the same way]] (for example, like IPA {{IPA|[\u0252]}} in the [[Boston accent|Boston dialect]]); for those speakers who maintain the distinction, depending on the accent, the vowel in ''cot'' may vary from {{IPA|[\u0251]}} to {{IPA|[a]}}, while the vowel in ''caught'' may vary from {{IPA|[\u0254]}} to {{IPA|[\u0251]}}, or may even be a diphthong.  Using one letter for the vowel in ''cot'' (instead of having different letters for different pronunciations of the ''o'') enables the dictionary to provide meaningful pronunciations for speakers of most dialects of English.\n-->\n\n====Other languages====\nThe IPA is also not universal among dictionaries in languages other than English. Monolingual dictionaries of languages with generally [[phonemic orthography|phonemic orthographies]] generally do not bother with indicating the pronunciation of most words, and tend to use respelling systems for words with unexpected pronunciations. Dictionaries produced in [[Israel]] use the IPA rarely and sometimes use the [[Hebrew alphabet]] for transcription of foreign words. Monolingual Hebrew dictionaries use pronunciation respelling for words with unusual spelling; for example, the ''[[Even-Shoshan Dictionary]]'' respells {{Hebrew|\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05db\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea}} as {{Hebrew|\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05db\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea}} because this word uses [[kamatz]] katan. Bilingual dictionaries that translate from foreign languages into [[Russian language|Russian]] usually employ the IPA, but monolingual Russian dictionaries occasionally use pronunciation respelling for foreign words; for example, [[Sergey Ozhegov]]'s dictionary adds \u043d\u044d\u0301 in brackets for the [[French language|French]] word \u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043d\u0435 (''{{lang|fr|[[pince-nez]]}}'') to indicate that the final [[\u0435]] does not [[Iotation|iotate]] the preceding [[\u043d]].\n\nThe IPA is more common in bilingual dictionaries, but there are exceptions here too. Mass-market bilingual Czech dictionaries, for instance, tend to use the IPA only for sounds not found in the [[Czech language]].<ref>{{cs icon}} {{Cite book|last=Fronek|first=J.|title=Velk\u00fd anglicko-\u010desk\u00fd slovn\u00edk|year=2006|publisher=Leda|location=Praha|language=Czech|isbn=80-7335-022-X|quote=In accordance with long-established Czech lexicographical tradition, a modified version of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is adopted in which letters of the Czech alphabet are employed.}}</ref>\n\n===Standard orthographies and case variants===\n{{main|Case variants of IPA letters}}\nIPA letters have been incorporated into the alphabets of various languages, notably via the [[Africa Alphabet]] in many sub-Saharan languages such as [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Akan language|Akan]], [[Gbe languages]], [[Manding languages]], [[Lingala language|Lingala]], etc. This has created the need for capital variants. For example, [[Kabiy\u00e9 language|Kabiy\u00e8]] of northern [[Togo]] has [[African D|\u0189 \u0256]], [[Eng (letter)|\u014a \u014b]], [[Latin gamma|\u0194 \u0263]], [[Open O|\u0186 \u0254]], [[Latin epsilon|\u0190 \u025b]], [[\u01b2|\u01b2 \u028b]]. These, and others, are supported by [[Unicode]], but appear in Latin ranges other than the [[IPA Extensions (Unicode block)|IPA extensions]].\n\nIn the IPA itself, however, only lower-case letters are used. The 1949 edition of the IPA handbook indicated that an asterisk {{angbr|*}} may be prefixed to indicate that a word is a proper name,<ref>''Principles of the International Phonetic Association,'' 1949:17.</ref> but this convention was not included in the 1999 ''Handbook''.\n\n===Classical singing===\nIPA has widespread use among classical singers during preparation as they are frequently required to sing in a variety of foreign languages, in addition to being taught by vocal coach in order to perfect the diction of their students and to globally improve tone quality and tuning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Severens|first=Sara E.|year=2017|title=The Effects of the International Phonetic Alphabet in Singing|url=https://digitalshowcase.lynchburg.edu/studentshowcase/2017/presentations/53/|language=en}}</ref> Opera [[libretto]]s are authoritatively transcribed in IPA, such as [[Nico Castel]]'s volumes<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.castelopera.com/libretti.htm | title=Nico Castel's Complete Libretti Series | publisher=Castel Opera Arts | accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref> and Timothy Cheek's book ''Singing in Czech''.<ref>{{Cite book| url=http://scarecrowpress.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&db=%5EDB/CATALOG.db&eqSKUdata=0810840030 | last=Cheek | first=Timothy | title=Singing in Czech | year=2001 | page=392 | isbn=978-0-8108-4003-4 | publisher=The Scarecrow Press}}</ref>  Opera singers' ability to read IPA was used by the site ''Visual Thesaurus'', which employed several opera singers \"to make recordings for the 150,000 words and phrases in VT's lexical database&nbsp;... for their vocal stamina, attention to the details of enunciation, and most of all, knowledge of IPA\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=155 | title=Operatic IPA and the Visual Thesaurus | last=Zimmer | first=Benjamin | authorlink=Benjamin Zimmer | work=[[Language Log]] | publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] | accessdate=29 September 2009 | date=14 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Letters==\n{{See also|International Phonetic Alphabet chart}}\nThe International Phonetic Association organizes the letters of the IPA into three categories: [[pulmonic sounds|pulmonic]] consonants, non-pulmonic consonants, and vowels.<ref>\"Segments can usefully be divided into two major categories, consonants and vowels.\" (International Phonetic Association, ''Handbook'', p.&nbsp;3)</ref><ref>International Phonetic Association, ''Handbook'', p.&nbsp;6.</ref>\n\nPulmonic consonant letters are arranged singly or in pairs of voiceless ([[tenuis consonant|tenuis]]) and voiced sounds, with these then grouped in columns from front (labial) sounds on the left to back (glottal) sounds on the right. In official publications by the IPA, two columns are omitted to save space, with the letters listed among 'other symbols',<ref>\"for presentational convenience [...] because of [their] rarity and the small number of types of sounds which are found there.\" (IPA ''Handbook'', p 18)</ref> and with the remaining consonants arranged in rows from full closure (occlusives: stops and nasals), to brief closure (vibrants: trills and taps), to partial closure (fricatives) and minimal closure (approximants), again with a row left out to save space. In the table below, a slightly different arrangement is made: All pulmonic consonants are included in the pulmonic-consonant table, and the vibrants and laterals are separated out so that the rows reflect the common [[lenition]] pathway of ''stop \u2192 fricative \u2192 approximant,'' as well as the fact that several letters pull double duty as both fricative and approximant; [[affricate]]s may be created by joining stops and fricatives from adjacent cells. Shaded cells represent articulations that are judged to be impossible.\n\nVowel letters are also grouped in pairs\u2014of unrounded and rounded vowel sounds\u2014with these pairs also arranged from front on the left to back on the right, and from maximal closure at top to minimal closure at bottom. No vowel letters are omitted from the chart, though in the past some of the mid central vowels were listed among the 'other symbols'.\n\n===IPA number===\nEach character is assigned a number, to prevent confusion between similar characters (such as {{IPA|\u0275}} and {{IPA|\u03b8}}, {{IPA|\u0264}} and {{IPA|\u0263}}, or {{IPA|\u0283}} and {{IPA|\u0284}}) in such situations as the printing of manuscripts. The categories of sounds are assigned different ranges of numbers.<ref>A chart of IPA numbers can be found on the IPA website.[https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/sites/default/files/IPA_Number_chart_(C)2005.pdf IPA number chart]</ref>\n\nThe numbers are assigned to sounds and to symbols, e.g. 304 is the [[open front unrounded vowel]], 415 is the centralization diacritic. Together, they form a symbol that represents the [[open central unrounded vowel]], {{IPA|[\u00e4]}}.\n\n===Consonants===\n{{Main|Consonant}}\n\n====Pulmonic consonants====\n{{see also|IPA pulmonic consonant chart with audio}}\nA [[Egressive|pulmonic]] consonant is a consonant made by obstructing the [[glottis]] (the space between the vocal cords) or [[Human mouth|oral cavity]] (the mouth) and either simultaneously or subsequently letting out air from the lungs. Pulmonic consonants make up the majority of consonants in the IPA, as well as in human language. All consonants in the English language fall into this category.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|authorlink=Victoria Fromkin|author2=Rodman, Robert|title=An Introduction to Language|origyear=1974|year=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers|location=Fort Worth, TX |edition= 6th|isbn=0-03-018682-X}}</ref>\n\nThe pulmonic consonant table, which includes most consonants, is arranged in rows that designate [[manner of articulation]], meaning how the consonant is produced, and columns that designate [[place of articulation]], meaning where in the vocal tract the consonant is produced. The main chart includes only consonants with a single place of articulation.\n{{IPA pulmonic consonants|caption=|affricates=no|notes=no}}\n\n'''Notes'''\n* In rows where some letters appear in pairs (the ''[[obstruent]]s''), the letter to the right represents a [[voice (phonetics)|voiced consonant]] (except [[breathy voice|breathy-voiced]] {{IPA|[\u0266]}}). However, {{IPA|[\u0294]}} cannot be voiced, and the voicing of {{IPA|[\u02a1]}} is ambiguous.<ref>Ladefoged and Maddieson, 1996, ''Sounds of the World's Languages,'' \u00a72.1.</ref> In the other rows (the ''[[sonorant]]s''), the single letter represents a voiced consonant.\n* Although there is a single letter for the coronal places of articulation for all consonants but fricatives, when dealing with a particular language, the letters may be treated as specifically dental, alveolar, or post-alveolar, as appropriate for that language, without diacritics.\n* Shaded areas indicate articulations judged to be impossible.\n* The letters {{IPA|[\u0281, \u0295, \u02a2]}} represent either voiced fricatives or approximants.\n* In many languages, such as English, {{IPA|[h]}} and {{IPA|[\u0266]}} are not actually glottal, fricatives, or approximants. Rather, they are bare [[phonation]].<ref>Ladefoged and Maddieson, 1996, ''Sounds of the World's Languages,'' \u00a79.3.</ref>\n* It is primarily the shape of the tongue rather than its position that distinguishes the fricatives {{IPA|[\u0283 \u0292]}}, {{IPA|[\u0255 \u0291]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0282 \u0290]}}.\n* Some listed phones are not known to exist as [[phoneme]]s in any language.\n\n====Non-pulmonic consonants====\nNon-pulmonic consonants are sounds whose airflow is not dependent on the lungs. These include [[click consonant|clicks]] (found in the [[Khoisan languages]] of Africa), [[Implosive consonant|implosives]] (found in languages such as [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]), and [[ejective consonant|ejectives]] (found in many [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian]] and [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]]).\n{{IPA non-pulmonic consonants|caption=|nonipa=no|affricates=no|notes=no}}\n\n'''Notes'''\n* Clicks have traditionally been described as double articulation of a forward 'release' and a rear 'accompaniment', with the click letters representing only the release. Therefore, all clicks require two letters for proper notation: {{angbr|{{IPA|k\u0361\u01c2, \u0261\u0361\u01c2, \u014b\u0361\u01c2, q\u0361\u01c2, \u0262\u0361\u01c2, \u0274\u0361\u01c2}}}} ''etc.'', or {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c2\u0361k, \u01c2\u0361\u0261, \u01c2\u0361\u014b, \u01c2\u0361q, \u01c2\u0361\u0262, \u01c2\u0361\u0274}}}}. When the dorsal articulation is omitted, a {{IPA|[k]}} may usually be assumed. However, recent research disputes the concept of 'accompaniment' and the idea that clicks are doubly articulated, with the rear occlusion instead simply being part of the airstream mechanisms.<ref>Amanda L. Miller ''et al.'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20070609200226/http://ling.cornell.edu/plab/amanda/amiller_jipa.pdf \"Differences in airstream and posterior place of articulation among N\u01c0uu lingual stops\"]. Submitted to the ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association''. Retrieved 27 May 2007.</ref> In these approaches, the click letter represents both articulations, with the different letters representing different click 'types', there is no velar-uvular distinction, and the accompanying letter represents the manner, phonation, or airstream [[contour (linguistics)|contour]] of the click: {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c2, \u1da2\u01c2, \u1d51\u01c2}}}} ''etc.''\n* Letters for the [[voiceless]] implosives {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01a5, \u01ad, \u0188, \u0199, \u02a0}}&thinsp;}} are no longer supported by the IPA, though they remain in Unicode. Instead, the IPA typically uses the voiced equivalent with a voiceless diacritic: {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0253\u0325, \u029b\u0325}}&thinsp;}}, ''etc.''.\n* Although not confirmed as contrastive in any language, and therefore not explicitly recognized by the IPA, a letter for the [[Voiced retroflex implosive|retroflex implosive]], <span title=\"U+1D91\">{{angbr|{{IPA|\u1d91}}&thinsp;}}</span>, has been assigned an IPA number.\n* The ejective diacritic often stands in for a superscript glottal stop in [[Glottalic consonant|glottalized]] but pulmonic [[sonorant]]s, such as {{IPA|[m\u02c0]}}, {{IPA|[l\u02c0]}}, {{IPA|[w\u02c0]}}, {{IPA|[a\u02c0]}}. These may also be transcribed as creaky {{IPA|[m\u0330]}}, {{IPA|[l\u0330]}}, {{IPA|[w\u0330]}}, {{IPA|[a\u0330]}}.\n\n====Affricates====\n[[Affricate consonant|Affricates]] and [[Doubly articulated consonant|co-articulated]] stops are represented by two letters joined by a tie bar, either above or below the letters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phonetic analysis of Afrikaans, English, Xhosa and Zulu using South African speech databases|url= http://www.ajol.info/index.php/salas/article/viewFile/6562/13287|publisher=Ajol.info|accessdate=20 November 2012|quote=It is traditional to place the tie bar above the letters. It may be placed below to avoid overlap with ascenders or diacritic marks, or simply because it is more legible that way, as in Niesler, Louw, & Roux (2005)}}</ref> The six most common affricates are optionally represented by [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], though this is no longer official IPA usage,<ref name=\"IPA 1999\"/> because a great number of ligatures would be required to represent all affricates this way. Alternatively, a superscript notation for a consonant release is sometimes used to transcribe affricates, for example {{IPA|t\u02e2}} for {{IPA|t\u0361s}}, paralleling {{IPA|k\u02e3}} ~ {{IPA|k\u0361x}}. The letters for the palatal plosives {{IPA|c}} and {{IPA|\u025f}} are often used as a convenience for {{IPA|t\u0361\u0283}} and {{IPA|d\u0361\u0292}} or similar affricates, even in official IPA publications, so they must be interpreted with care.\n{{IPA affricates|caption=|notes=no}}\n\n'''Note'''\n* On browsers that use ''[[Arial Unicode MS]]'' to display IPA characters, the following incorrectly formed sequences may look better due to a bug in that font: {{IPA|ts\u0361}}, {{IPA|t\u0283\u0361}}, {{IPA|t\u0255\u0361}}, {{IPA|dz\u0361}}, {{IPA|d\u0292\u0361}}, {{IPA|d\u0291\u0361}}, {{IPA|t\u026c\u0361}}.\n\n====Co-articulated consonants====\n[[Co-articulated consonant]]s are sounds that involve two simultaneous [[Place of articulation|places of articulation]] (are pronounced using two parts of the [[vocal tract]]). In English, the {{IPA|[w]}} in \"went\" is a coarticulated consonant, being pronounced by rounding the lips and raising the back of the tongue. Similar sounds are {{IPA|[\u028d]}} and {{IPA|[\u0265]}}.\n{{IPA co-articulated consonants|caption=|notes=no}}\n\n'''Notes'''\n* {{IPA|[\u0267]}} is described as a \"simultaneous {{IPA|[\u0283]}} and {{IPA|[x]}}\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ladefoged |first=Peter |author2=[[Ian Maddieson]] |year=1996 |title=The sounds of the world's languages |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell|pages=329\u2013330|isbn=0-631-19815-6}}</ref> However, this analysis is disputed. (See [[voiceless palatal-velar fricative]] for discussion.)\n* Multiple tie bars can be used: {{angle bracket|{{IPA|a\u0361b\u0361c}}}} or {{angle bracket|{{IPA|a\u035cb\u035cc}}}}. For instance, if a prenasalized stop is transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|m\u0361b}}}}, and a doubly articulated stop {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u0261\u0361b}}}}, then a prenasalized doubly articulated stop would be {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u014b\u0361m\u0361\u0261\u0361b}}}}\n* On browsers that use ''[[Arial Unicode MS]]'' to display IPA characters, the following incorrectly formed sequences may look better due to a bug in that font: {{IPA|kp\u0361, \u0261b\u0361, \u014bm\u0361}}.\n\n===Vowels===\n{{Main|Vowel}}\n{{see also|IPA vowel chart with audio}}\n[[File:Cardinal vowel tongue position-front.svg|thumb|200px|Tongue positions of [[Cardinal vowel|cardinal]] front vowels, with highest point indicated. The position of the highest point is used to determine vowel height and backness.]]\n[[File:Cardinal vowels-Jones x-ray.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Radiography|X-ray photos]] show the sounds {{IPA|[i, u, a, \u0251]}}.]]\n\nThe IPA defines a vowel as a sound which occurs at a syllable center.<ref>International Phonetic Association, ''Handbook'', p.&nbsp;10.</ref> Below is a chart depicting the vowels of the IPA. The IPA maps the vowels according to the position of the tongue.\n{{IPA vowels|caption=|notes=no}}\n\nThe vertical axis of the chart is mapped by [[vowel height]]. Vowels pronounced with the tongue lowered are at the bottom, and vowels pronounced with the tongue raised are at the top. For example, {{IPA|[\u0251]}} (the first vowel in ''father'') is at the bottom because the tongue is lowered in this position. However, {{IPA|[i]}} (the vowel in \"meet\") is at the top because the sound is said with the tongue raised to the roof of the mouth.\n\nIn a similar fashion, the horizontal axis of the chart is determined by [[vowel backness]]. Vowels with the tongue moved towards the front of the mouth (such as {{IPA|[\u025b]}}, the vowel in \"met\") are to the left in the chart, while those in which it is moved to the back (such as {{IPA|[\u028c]}}, the vowel in \"but\") are placed to the right in the chart.\n\nIn places where vowels are paired, the right represents a [[Roundedness|rounded vowel]] (in which the lips are rounded) while the left is its unrounded counterpart.\n\n====Diphthongs====\n[[Diphthong]]s are typically specified with a non-syllabic diacritic, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|u\u026a\u032f}}}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|u\u032f\u026a}}}}, or with a superscript for the on- or off-glide, as in {{angle bracket|{{IPA|u\u1da6}}}} or {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u1d58\u026a}}}}. Sometimes a tie bar is used, especially if it is difficult to tell if the diphthong is characterized by an on-glide, an off-glide or is variable: {{angbr|{{IPA|u\u0361\u026a}}}}.\n\n'''Notes'''\n* {{angbr|{{IPA|a}}}} officially represents a front vowel, but there is little distinction between front and central open vowels, and {{angbr|{{IPA|a}}}} is frequently used for an open central vowel.<ref name=\"thomason\" /> However, if disambiguation is required, the [[Retraction (phonetics)|retraction diacritic]] or the [[Relative articulation#Centralized vowels|centralized diacritic]] may be added to indicate an open central vowel, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|a\u0320}}}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|\u00e4}}}}.\n\n==Diacritics and prosodic notation {{anchor|Diacritics}}==\n[[Diacritic]]s are used for phonetic detail. They are added to IPA letters to indicate a modification or specification of that letter's normal pronunciation.<ref name=IPA15>International Phonetic Association, ''Handbook'', pp.&nbsp;14\u201315.</ref>\n\nBy being made superscript, any IPA letter may function as a diacritic, conferring elements of its articulation to the base letter. (See [[secondary articulation]] for a list of superscript IPA letters supported by Unicode.) Those superscript letters listed below are specifically provided for by the IPA; others include {{angbr|{{IPA|t\u02e2}}}} ({{IPA|[t]}} with fricative release), {{angbr|{{IPA|\u1d57s}}}} ({{IPA|[s]}} with affricate onset), {{angbr|{{IPA|\u207fd}}}} (prenasalized {{IPA|[d]}}), {{angbr|{{IPA|b\u02b1}}}} ({{IPA|[b]}} with breathy voice), {{angbr|{{IPA|m\u02c0}}}} (glottalized {{IPA|[m]}}), {{angbr|{{IPA|s\u1db4}}}} ({{IPA|[s]}} with a flavor of {{IPA|[\u0283]}}), {{angbr|{{IPA|o\u1db7}}}} ({{IPA|[o]}} with [[Vowel breaking|diphthongization]]), {{angbr|{{IPA|\u026f\u1d5d}}}} ([[compressed vowel|compressed]] {{IPA|[\u026f]}}). Superscript diacritics placed after a letter are ambiguous between simultaneous modification of the sound and phonetic detail at the end of the sound. For example, labialized {{angbr|{{IPA|k\u02b7}}}} may mean either simultaneous {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} or else {{IPA|[k]}} with a labialized release. Superscript diacritics placed before a letter, on the other hand, normally indicate a modification of the onset of the sound ({{angbr|{{IPA|m\u02c0}}}} glottalized {{IPA|[m]}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u02c0m}}}} {{IPA|[m]}} with a glottal onset).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Many linguists prefer one of the diacritics dedicated to breathy voice over simple aspiration, such as {{angbr|{{IPA|b\u0324}}}}. Some linguists restrict this diacritic to [[sonorant]]s, and transcribe obstruents as {{angbr|{{IPA|b\u02b1}}}}.\n\nSubdiacritics (diacritics normally placed below a letter) may be moved above a letter to avoid conflict with a [[descender]], as in voiceless {{angbr|{{IPA|\u014b\u030a}}}}.<ref name=IPA15 /> The raising and lowering diacritics have optional forms {{angbr|{{IPA|\u02d4}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u02d5}}}} that avoid descenders.\n\nThe state of the [[glottis]] can be finely transcribed with diacritics.

The four additional rising and falling tones supported by diacritics are high/mid rising {{IPA|\u0254\u1dc4, \u0254\u02e7\u02e5}}, low rising {{IPA|\u0254\u1dc5, \u0254\u02e9\u02e7}}, high falling {{IPA|\u0254\u1dc7, \u0254\u02e5\u02e7}}, and low/mid falling {{IPA|\u0254\u1dc6, \u0254\u02e7\u02e9}}.  That is, tone diacritics only support contour tones across three levels (high, mid, low), despite supporting five levels for register tones. For other contour tones, tone letters must be used: {{IPA|\u0254\u02e8\u02e6, \u0254\u02e5\u02e6}}, etc.  For more complex (peaking and dipping) tones, though it is theoretically possible to combine the three tone diacritics in any permutation, in practice only generic peaking {{IPA|\u0254\u1dc8}} and dipping {{IPA|\u0254\u1dc9}} combinations are used. For finer detail, tone letters are again required ({{IPA|\u0254\u02e7\u02e5\u02e7, \u0254\u02e9\u02e8\u02e9, \u0254\u02e6\u02e9\u02e7, \u0254\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6}}, etc.) The correspondence between tone diacritics and tone letters is therefore only approximate.\n\nA work-around for diacritics sometimes seen when a language has more than one rising or falling tone, and the author wishes to avoid the poorly legible diacritics {{IPA|\u0254\u1dc4, \u0254\u1dc5, \u0254\u1dc7, \u0254\u1dc6}} but does not wish to completely abandon the IPA, is to restrict generic rising {{IPA|\u0254\u030c}} and falling {{IPA|\u0254\u0302}} to the higher-pitched of the rising and falling tones, say {{IPA|\u0254\u02e5\u02e7}} and {{IPA|\u0254\u02e7\u02e5}}, and to use the old (retired) IPA subscript diacritics {{IPA|\u0254\u0317}} and {{IPA|\u0254\u0316}} for the lower-pitched rising and falling tones, say {{IPA|\u0254\u02e9\u02e7}} and {{IPA|\u0254\u02e7\u02e9}}. When a language has four or six level tones, the two mid tones are sometimes transcribed as high-mid {{IPA|\u0254\u030d}} (non-standard) and low-mid {{IPA|\u0254\u0304}}.\n\nA stress mark typically appears before the stressed syllable, and thus marks the syllable break as well as stress.  Where the syllable onset is a geminate consonant, e.g. in Italian, the consonant is commonly split by the stress mark, which means that the length sign is not used for gemination. (Thus {{angbr|{{IPA|av\u02c8v\u0254lse}}}} not *{{angbr|{{IPA|a\u02c8vv\u0254lse}}}}, *{{angbr|{{IPA|a\u02c8v\u02d0\u0254lse}}}}, or *{{angbr|{{IPA|av\u02c8\u02d0\u0254lse}}}}.) However, occasionally the stress mark is placed immediately before the stressed vowel, after any syllable onset ({{angbr|{{IPA|avv\u02c8\u0254lse}}}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|av\u02d0\u02c8\u0254lse}}}}).<ref>Payne, E. M. (2005) \"Phonetic variation in Italian consonant gemination\", ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', 35: 153\u2013181.</ref>  In such transcriptions, the stress mark does not function as a mark of the syllable boundary.\n\nTone letters generally appear after each syllable, for a language with syllable tone ({{angbr|{{IPA|a\u02e7v\u0254\u02e5\u02e9}}}}), or after the phonological word, for a language with [[word tone]] ({{angbr|{{IPA|av\u0254\u02e7\u02e5\u02e9}}}}). However, in older versions of the IPA, ''ad hoc'' tone marks were placed before the syllable, the same position as used to mark stress, and this convention is still sometimes seen ({{angbr|{{IPA|\u02e7a\u02e5\u02e9v\u0254}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u02e7\u02e5\u02e9av\u0254}}}}).\n\nThere are three boundary markers, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|.}}}} for a syllable break, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|<nowiki>|</nowiki>}}}} for a minor prosodic break and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u2016}}}} for a major prosodic break. The tags 'minor' and 'major' are intentionally ambiguous. Depending on need, 'minor' may vary from a [[foot (prosody)|foot]] break to a continuing\u2013prosodic-unit boundary (equivalent to a comma), and while 'major' is often any intonation break, it may be restricted to a final\u2013prosodic-unit boundary (equivalent to a period). Although not part of the IPA, the following boundary symbols are often used in conjunction with the IPA: {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u03bc}}}} for a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]] or mora boundary, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u03c3}}}} for a syllable or syllable boundary, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|#}}}} for a word boundary, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|$}}}} for a phrase or intermediate boundary and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|%}}}} for a prosodic boundary. For example, C# is a word-final consonant, %V a post-[[pausa]] vowel, and T% an IU-final tone (edge tone).\n\n===Comparative degree===\nIPA diacritics may be doubled to indicate an extra degree of the feature indicated. This is a productive process, but apart from extra-high and extra-low tones {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0259\u030b, \u0259\u030f}}}} being marked by doubled high- and low-tone diacritics, and the major [[prosodic unit|prosodic break]] {{angbr|{{IPA|\u2016}}}} being marked as a double minor break {{angbr|{{IPA|{{!}}}}}}, it is not specifically regulated by the IPA. (Note that transcription marks are similar: double slashes indicate extra (morpho)-phonemic, double square brackets especially precise, and double parentheses especially unintelligible.) {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nFor example, the stress mark may be doubled to indicate an extra degree of stress, such as prosodic stress in English.<ref>Bloomfield (1933) ''Language'' p. 91</ref> An example in French, with a single stress mark for normal prosodic stress at the end of each [[prosodic unit]] (marked as a minor prosodic break), and a double stress mark for contrastive/emphatic stress: <br />{{IPA|[\u02c8\u02c8\u0251\u0303\u02d0\u02c8tre {{!}} m\u0259\u02c8sj\u00f8 \u2016 \u02c8\u02c8vwala ma\u02c8dam \u2016]}} ''{{lang|fr|Entrez monsieur, voil\u00e0 madame}}.'' <ref>Passy, 1958, ''Conversations fran\u00e7aises en transcription phon\u00e9tique.'' 2nd ed.</ref> Similarly, a doubled secondary stress mark {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u02cc\u02cc}}}} is commonly used for tertiary stress.\n\n[[Length (phonetics)|Length]] is commonly extended by repeating the length mark, as in English ''shhh!'' {{IPA|[\u0283\u02d0\u02d0\u02d0]}}, or for \"overlong\" segments in [[Estonian phonology|Estonian]]:\n* ''vere'' {{IPA|/vere/}} 'blood [gen.sg.]', ''veere'' {{IPA|/ve\u02d0re/}} 'edge [gen.sg.]', ''veere'' {{IPA|/ve\u02d0\u02d0re/}} 'roll [imp. 2nd sg.]'\n* ''lina'' {{IPA|/lin\u0251/}} 'sheet', ''linna'' {{IPA|/lin\u02d0\u0251/}} 'town [gen. sg.]', ''linna'' {{IPA|/lin\u02d0\u02d0\u0251/}} 'town [ine. sg.]'\n(Normally additional degrees of length are handled by the extra-short or half-long diacritics, but in the Estonian examples, the first two cases are analyzed as simply short and long.)\n\nOccasionally other diacritics are doubled:\n* [[R-colored vowel|Rhoticity]] in [[Badaga language|Badaga]] {{IPA|/be/}} \"mouth\", {{IPA|/be\u02de/}} \"bangle\", and {{IPA|/be\u02de\u02de/}} \"crop\".<ref>{{SOWL|314}}</ref>\n* [[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspiration]], for example contrasting [[Korean phonology|Korean]] mild aspiration {{IPA|[k\u02b0]}} with strong aspiration {{IPA|[k\u02b0\u02b0]}}.<ref>Sometimes the obsolete transcription {{angle bracket|{{IPA|k\u2018}}}} vs. {{angle bracket|{{IPA|k\u02b0}}}}is still seen.</ref>\n* [[Nasal vowel|Nasalization]], as in [[Palantla Chinantec]] {{IPA|/\u1ebd/}} vs {{IPA|/e\u034c/}}.<ref>Peter Ladefoged (1971) ''Preliminaries of Linguistic Phonetics'', p. 35.</ref>\n* Weak vs strong [[ejective]]s, {{IPA|[k\u02bc]}}, {{IPA|[k\u201d]}}.<ref>Fallon (2013) ''The Synchronic and Diachronic Phonology of Ejectives'', p. 267</ref>\n* Especially lowered, e.g. {{IPA|[t\u031e\u031e]}} (or {{IPA|[t\u031e\u02d5]}}, if the former symbol does not display properly) for {{IPA|/t/}} as a weak fricative in some pronunciations of ''register''.<ref>Heselwood (2013) ''Phonetic Transcription in Theory and Practice'', p. 233.</ref>\n* Especially retracted (at least on a vowel), e.g. {{IPA|[\u00f8\u0320\u0320]}},<ref>E.g. in Laver (1994) ''Principles of Phonetics'', pp. 559\u2013560</ref> though, depending on the font, on a consonant this could be confused with alveolar or alveolarized notation from the [[extIPA]], though such an issue can be easily avoided by placing the second diacritic ''to the right of'' the letter ({{IPA|[\u00f8\u0320\u02d7]}}), rather than below the first diacritic.\n* The transcription of [[strident vowel|strident]] and [[harsh voice]] as extra-creaky {{IPA|/a\u1dfd/}} may be motivated by the similarities of these phonations.\n\n==Obsolete and nonstandard symbols==\n{{Main|Obsolete and nonstandard symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet|Click letter}}\nThe IPA once had parallel symbols from alternative proposals, but in most cases eventually settled on one for each sound. The rejected symbols are now considered obsolete. An example is the vowel letter {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0277}}}}, rejected in favor of {{angbr|{{IPA|\u028a}}}}. Letters for affricates and sounds with inherent secondary articulation have also been mostly rejected, with the idea that such features should be indicated with tie bars or diacritics: {{angbr|{{IPA|\u018d}}}} for {{IPA|[z\u02b7]}} is one. In addition, the rare voiceless implosives, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01a5 \u01ad \u0188 \u0199 \u02a0}}}}, have been dropped and are now usually written {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0253\u0325 \u0257\u0325 \u0284\u030a \u0260\u030a \u029b\u0325}}}}. A retired set of click letters, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0287, \u0297, \u0296}}}}, is still sometimes seen, as the official pipe letters {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c0, \u01c3, \u01c1}}}} may cause problems with legibility, especially when used with brackets ([ ] or / /), the letter {{angbr|{{IPA|l}}}}, or the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] marks {{angbr|{{IPA|<nowiki>|, \u2016</nowiki>}}}} (for this reason, some publications which use the current IPA pipe letters disallow IPA brackets<!--The Routledge Khoisan Handbook, for example-->).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2009/09/click-symbols.html |title=John Wells's phonetic blog |publisher=Phonetic-blog.blogspot.com |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nIndividual non-IPA letters may find their way into publications that otherwise use the standard IPA. This is especially common with:\n* Affricates, such as the Americanist [[barred lambda]] {{angbr|{{IPA|\u019b}}}} for {{IPA|[t\u035c\u026c]}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|\u010d}}}} for {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283]}}. Some authors find the tie bars displeasing but the lack of tie bars confusing (i.e. {{angbr|{{IPA|\u010d}}}} for {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}} as distinct from {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}), while others simply prefer to have one letter for each segmental phoneme in a language.\n* Digits for tonal phonemes that have conventional numbers in a local tradition, such as the [[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones|four tones of Standard Chinese]]. This may be more convenient for comparison between languages and dialects than a phonetic transcription because tones often vary more than segmental phonemes do.\n* Digits for tone levels, though the lack of standardization can cause confusion (with e.g. \"1\" for high tone in some languages but for low tone in others).\n* Iconic extensions of standard IPA letters that can be readily understood, such as retroflex [[voiced retroflex implosive|{{angbr|\u1d91\u2009}}]] and [[voiceless retroflex lateral fricative|{{angbr|\ua78e}}]].\n\nIn addition, there are typewriter substitutions for when IPA support is not available, such as capital {{angbr|I, E, U, O, A}} for {{IPA|[\u026a, \u025b, \u028a, \u0254, \u0251]}}.\n\n==Extensions==\n{{Main|Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet}}\nThe \"Extensions to the IPA\", often abbreviated as \"extIPA\" and sometimes called \"Extended IPA\", are symbols whose original purpose was to accurately transcribe [[Speech disorder|disordered speech]]. At the [[Kiel Convention]] in 1989, a group of linguists drew up the initial extensions,<ref>\"At the 1989 Kiel Convention of the IPA, a sub-group was established to draw up recommendations for the transcription of disordered speech.\" (\"Extensions to the IPA: An ExtIPA Chart\" ''in'' International Phonetic Association, ''Handbook'', p.&nbsp;186.)</ref> which were based on the previous work of the PRDS (Phonetic Representation of Disordered Speech) Group in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite book|last=PRDS Group|title=The Phonetic Representation of Disordered Speech|year=1983|publisher=London: The King's Fund}}</ref> The extensions were first published in 1990, then modified, and published again in 1994 in the ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', when they were officially adopted by the [[International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics Association|ICPLA]].<ref>\"Extensions to the IPA: An ExtIPA Chart\" ''in'' International Phonetic Association, ''Handbook'', pp.&nbsp;186\u2013187.</ref> While the original purpose was to transcribe disordered speech, linguists have used the extensions to designate a number of unique sounds within standard communication, such as hushing, gnashing teeth, and smacking lips. The extensions have also been used to record certain peculiarities in an individual's voice, such as nasalized voicing.<ref name=\"world\" />\n\nThe Extensions to the IPA do not include symbols used for voice quality ([[Voice Quality Symbols]]), such as whispering.\n\n==Segments without letters==\nThe remaining blank cells on the IPA chart can be filled without too much difficulty if the need arises. Some ''[[ad hoc]]'' letters have appeared in the literature for the retroflex lateral flap, the voiceless lateral fricatives, the epiglottal trill, and the labiodental plosives. (See the grey letters in the PDF chart.) Diacritics can supply much of the remainder.<ref>\"Diacritics may also be employed to create symbols for phonemes, thus reducing the need to create new letter shapes.\" (International Phonetic Association, Handbook, p.&nbsp;27)</ref> If a sound cannot be transcribed, an asterisk {{angbr|*}} may be used, either as a letter or as a diacritic (as in {{angbr|k*}} sometimes seen for the [[Korean phonology|Korean]] \"fortis\" velar).\n\n===Consonants===\nRepresentations of consonant sounds outside of the core set are created by adding diacritics to letters with similar sound values. The Spanish bilabial and dental approximants are commonly written as lowered fricatives, {{IPA|[\u03b2\u031e]}} and {{IPA|[\u00f0\u031e]}} respectively. Similarly, voiced lateral fricatives would be written as raised lateral approximants, {{IPA|[\u026d\u02d4 \u028e\u031d \u029f\u031d]}}. A few languages such as [[Banda languages|Banda]] have a bilabial flap as the preferred allophone of what is elsewhere a labiodental flap. It has been suggested that this be written with the labiodental flap letter and the advanced diacritic, {{IPA|[\u2c71\u031f]}}.<ref>Olson, Kenneth S.; & Hajek, John. (1999). The phonetic status of the labial flap. ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', ''29'' (2), pp.&nbsp;101\u2013114.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, a labiodental trill would be written {{IPA|[\u0299\u032a]}} (bilabial trill and the dental sign), and labiodental stops {{IPA|[p\u032a b\u032a]}} rather than with the ''ad hoc'' letters sometimes found in the literature. Other taps can be written as extra-short plosives or laterals, e.g. {{IPA|[\u025f\u0306 \u0262\u0306 \u029f\u0306]}}, though in some cases the diacritic would need to be written below the letter. A retroflex trill can be written as a retracted {{IPA|[r\u0320]}}, just as retroflex fricatives sometimes are. The remaining consonants, the uvular laterals ({{IPA|\u029f\u0320}} ''etc.'') and the palatal trill, while not strictly impossible, are very difficult to pronounce and are unlikely to occur even as allophones in the world's languages.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe vowels are similarly manageable by using diacritics for raising, lowering, fronting, backing, centering, and mid-centering.<ref>\"The diacritics...can be used to modify the lip or tongue position implied by a vowel symbol.\" (International Phonetic Association, Handbook, p.&nbsp;16)</ref> For example, the unrounded equivalent of {{IPA|[\u028a]}} can be transcribed as mid-centered {{IPA|[\u026f\u033d]}}, and the rounded equivalent of {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} as raised {{IPA|[\u0276\u031d]}} or lowered {{IPA|[\u0153\u031e]}}. True mid vowels are lowered {{IPA|[e\u031e \u00f8\u031e \u0258\u031e \u0275\u031e \u0264\u031e o\u031e]}} or raised {{IPA|[\u025b\u031d \u0153\u031d \u025c\u031d \u025e\u031d \u028c\u031d \u0254\u031d]}}, while centered {{IPA|[\u026a\u0308 \u028a\u0308]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e4]}} (or, less commonly, {{IPA|[\u0251\u0308]}}) are near-close and open central vowels, respectively. The only known vowels that cannot be represented in this scheme are vowels with unexpected [[roundedness]], which would require a dedicated diacritic, such as {{angbr|{{IPA|\u028f\u02b7}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|u\u1d5d}}}} (or {{angbr|{{IPA|\u026a\u02b7}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|\u026f\u1d5d}}}}).\n\n==Symbol names==\n{{Main|Naming conventions of the International Phonetic Alphabet}}\nAn IPA symbol is often distinguished from the sound it is intended to represent, since there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between letter and sound in broad transcription, making articulatory descriptions such as 'mid front rounded vowel' or 'voiced velar stop' unreliable. While the ''Handbook of the International Phonetic Association'' states that no official names exist for its symbols, it admits the presence of one or two common names for each.<ref>\"...the International Phonetic Association has never officially approved a set of names...\" (International Phonetic Association, ''Handbook'', p.&nbsp;31)</ref> The symbols also have [[Nonce word|nonce names]] in the [[Unicode]] standard. In some cases, the Unicode names and the IPA names do not agree. For example, IPA calls {{IPA|\u025b}} \"epsilon\", but Unicode calls it \"small letter open E\".\n\nThe traditional names of the Latin and Greek letters are usually used for unmodified letters.<ref group=note>\nFor example, {{IPA|[p]}} is called \"Lower-case P\" and {{IPA|[\u03c7]}} is \"Chi.\" (International Phonetic Association, ''Handbook'', p.&nbsp;171)\n</ref> Letters which are not directly derived from these alphabets, such as {{IPAblink|\u0295}}, may have a variety of names, sometimes based on the appearance of the symbol or on the sound that it represents. In Unicode, some of the letters of Greek origin have Latin forms for use in IPA; the others use the letters from the Greek section.\n\nFor diacritics, there are two methods of naming. For traditional diacritics, the IPA notes the name in a well known language; for example, {{strong|{{IPA|\u00e9}}}} is ''[[Acute accent|acute]]'', based on the name of the diacritic in English and French. Non-traditional diacritics are often named after objects they resemble, so {{strong|{{IPA|d\u032a}}}} is called ''bridge''.\n\n[[Geoffrey Pullum]] and [[William Ladusaw]] list a variety of names in use for IPA symbols, both current and retired, in addition to names of many other non-IPA phonetic symbols.<ref name=Pullum/> Their collection is extensive enough that the [[Unicode Consortium]] used it in the development of [[Unicode]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Typefaces==\nIPA typeface support is increasing, and is now included in several typefaces such as the [[Times New Roman]] versions that come with various recent computer [[operating systems]]. Diacritics are not always properly rendered, however. IPA typefaces that are freely available online include [[Gentium]], several from the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics|SIL]] (such as [[Charis SIL]], and [[Doulos SIL]]), [[Dehuti]], [[DejaVu fonts|DejaVu Sans]], and [[Bitstream Cyberbit|TITUS Cyberbit]], which are all [[Free software Unicode typefaces|freely available]]; as well as commercial typefaces such as Brill, available from [[Brill Publishers]], and  [[Lucida Sans Unicode]] and [[Arial Unicode MS]], shipping with various [[Microsoft]] products. These all include several ranges of characters in addition to the IPA. Modern [[Web browser]]s generally do not need any configuration to display these symbols, provided that a typeface capable of doing so is available to the operating system.\n\n==ASCII and keyboard transliterations==\nSeveral systems have been developed that map the IPA symbols to [[ASCII]] characters. Notable systems include [[Kirshenbaum]], [[ARPABET]], [[SAMPA]], and [[X-SAMPA]]. The usage of mapping systems in on-line text has to some extent been adopted in the context input methods, allowing convenient keying of IPA characters that would be otherwise unavailable on standard keyboard layouts.\n\n==Computer input using on-screen keyboard==\nOnline IPA keyboard utilities<ref>Online IPA keyboard utilities like [http://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/keating/IPA/inter_chart_2018/IPA_2018.html IPA i-chart by the Association], [https://r12a.github.io/pickers/ipa/ IPA character picker 19 at GitHub], [http://ipa.typeit.org/full/ TypeIt.org], and [https://westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart/keyboard/ IPA Chart keyboard at GitHub].</ref> are available, and they cover the complete range of IPA symbols and diacritics.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Americanist phonetic notation]]\n* [[Arabic International Phonetic Alphabet]]\n* [[Articulatory phonetics]]\n* [[Index of phonetics articles]]\n* [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]]\n* [[List of international common standards]]\n* [[Luciano Canepari]] \u2013 proponent of an elaborated IPA\n* [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]\n* [[Phonetic symbols in Unicode]]\n* [[Semyon Novgorodov]] \u2013 inventor of IPA-based [[Yakut scripts]]\n* [[TIPA (software)|TIPA]] provides IPA support for [[LaTeX]]\n* [[Uralic phonetic alphabet]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Martin J. |author2=John H.

On television, he appears in the 33-episode drama series ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' (1987\u20132000), in which [[John Thaw]] played the character, as well as the 2012 [[prequel]] series ''[[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]]'', portrayed by [[Shaun Evans]]. The older Morse is a senior [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] (Criminal Investigation Department) officer with the [[Thames Valley Police]] force in [[Oxford, England]], and in the prequel Morse is a young graduate Detective Constable rising through the ranks with the [[Oxford City Police]]. \n\nMorse presents, to some, a reasonably sympathetic personality, despite his sullen and snobbish temperament, with a classic [[Jaguar Mark 2|Jaguar car]] (a [[Lancia]] in the early novels), a thirst for English [[Cask ale#Real ale|real ale]], and a love of classical music (especially opera and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]), poetry, art and cryptic crossword puzzles. In his later career he is usually assisted by his Sergeant, [[Sergeant Lewis|Robbie Lewis]]. Morse's partnership and formal friendship with Lewis is fundamental to the series.\n\n==Biography==\n===Family===\nMorse's father was a taxi driver, and Morse likes to explain the origin of his additional private income by saying that he \"used to drive the [[Aga Khan]]\".<ref>''[[The Dead of Jericho]]'', chapter 21</ref> In the episode ''[[Cherubim and Seraphim]]'', it is revealed that Morse's parents divorced when he was 12. He remained with his mother until her death three years later, upon which he had to return to his father. Morse had a dreadful relationship with his stepmother Gwen. He claims that he only read poetry to annoy her, and that her petty bullying almost drove him to suicide. He has a half-sister named Joyce with whom he is on better terms. Morse was devastated when Joyce's daughter Marilyn took her own life.\n\nMorse prefers to use only his surname, and is generally evasive when asked about his first name, sometimes joking that it is ''Inspector''. In ''The Wench Is Dead'' it was stated that his initial was E.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/books/colin-dexter-dead-creator-of-inspector-morse.html</ref> At the end of ''[[Death Is Now My Neighbour]]'', it is revealed to be ''Endeavour''. Two-thirds of the way through the television episode based on the book, he gives the cryptic clue \"My whole life's effort has revolved around Eve\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0611637/|title=Death Is Now My Neighbour|date=19 November 1997|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref> In the series, it is noted that Morse's reluctance to use his Christian name led to his receiving the nickname ''Pagan'' while attending [[Stamford School]] (which [[Colin Dexter]], the author of the Morse novels, attended). In the novels, Morse's first name came from the vessel [[HMS Endeavour|HMS ''Endeavour'']]; his mother was a member of the Religious Society of Friends ([[Quakers]]) who have a tradition of \"[[virtue name]]s\", and his father admired [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]].\n\nDexter was a fan of cryptic crosswords and named Morse after champion setter [[Jeremy Morse]], one of Dexter's arch-rivals in writing crossword clues.<ref>Colin Dexter in ''Super Sleuths: Inspector Morse''. Director: Katie Kinnaird</ref> Dexter used to walk along the bank of the River Thames at Oxford, opposite the boathouse belonging to 22nd Oxford Sea Scout Group; the building is named ''[[Training ship|T.S.]] Endeavour''.\n\n===Education===\nAlthough details of Morse's career are deliberately kept vague, it is hinted that he won a scholarship to study at [[St John's College, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dexter|first1=Colin|title=The Riddle of the Third Mile|publisher=St Martins Press|page=Chapter 7|edition=1983}}</ref> He lost the scholarship as the result of poor academic performance stemming from a failed love affair, which is mentioned in the Series 3, Episode 2, \"The Last Enemy\", and recounted in detail in the novel ''[[The Riddle of the Third Mile]]'', Chapter 7.\n\n===Career===\nAfter university, he entered the Army and, upon leaving, joined the police. He often reflects on such renowned scholars as [[Alfred Edward Housman|A. E. Housman]] who, like himself, failed to get an academic degree from Oxford. He was awarded the [[George Medal]] in the last episode of Endeavour Series 4.\n\n===Habits and personality===\nMorse is ostensibly the embodiment of white, male, middle-class Englishness, with a set of prejudices and assumptions to match (even though as the son of a taxi driver his background was thoroughly working class). He may thus be considered a late example of the [[gentleman detective]], a staple of British [[Detective fiction#Famous fictional detectives|detective fiction]]. This is in sharp contrast to the working-class lifestyle of his assistant [[Sergeant Lewis|Lewis]] (named after another rival clue-writer Mrs.&nbsp;B. Lewis); in the novels, Lewis is Welsh, but in the TV series this is altered to a Tyneside ([[Geordie]]) background, appropriately for the actor [[Kevin Whately]]. Morse is in his forties at the start of the books (''Service of all the Dead'', Chapter Six: \"\u2026 a bachelor still, forty-seven years old \u2026\"), and Lewis slightly younger (eg ''The Secret of Annexe 3'', Chapter Twenty-Six: \"a slightly younger man \u2013 another policeman, and one also in plain clothes\"). John Thaw was 45 at the beginning of shooting the TV series and Kevin Whately was 36.\n\nMorse's relationships with authority, the establishment, bastions of power and the status quo, are markedly ambiguous, as are some of his relations with women. He is frequently portrayed as patronising female characters. However he empathises with women, and once noted that the female sex is not naturally prone to crime, being caring and non-violent. He is not shy to show his liking for attractive women and often dates those involved in cases. Indeed a woman he falls in love with sometimes turns out to be the culprit.\n\nMorse is highly intelligent. He is a crossword addict<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/aug/09/top-10-crosswords-fiction-inspector-morse</ref> and dislikes spelling and grammatical errors; in every personal or private document that he receives, he manages to point out at least one mistake. He claims that his approach to crime-solving is deductive, and one of his key tenets is that \"there is a 50 per cent chance that the person who finds the body is the murderer\". Morse uses immense intuition and his fantastic memory to get to the killer.\n\nAmong Morse's conservative tastes are that he likes to drink real ale and whisky, and in the early novels, drives a [[Lancia]]. In the television and radio productions, this is altered to a suitably British vintage [[Jaguar Mark 2]]. His favourite music is opera, which is echoed in the soundtracks to the television series, along with original music by [[Barrington Pheloung]].\n\n==Novels==\nThe novels in the series are:\n* ''[[Last Bus to Woodstock]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Last Seen Wearing (Dexter novel)|Last Seen Wearing]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Service of All the Dead]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[The Dead of Jericho]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Riddle of the Third Mile]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[The Secret of Annexe 3]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[The Wench is Dead]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[The Jewel That Was Ours]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[The Way Through the Woods]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[The Daughters of Cain]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[Death Is Now My Neighbour]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[The Remorseful Day]]'' (1999)\n\nInspector Morse also appears in several stories in Dexter's short story collection, ''[[Morse's Greatest Mystery|Morse's Greatest Mystery and Other Stories]]'' (1993, expanded edition 1994).\n\nIn Dexter's last book, ''The Remorseful Day'', Morse dies in hospital from a heart attack.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n{{Main article|Inspector Morse (TV series)|Endeavour (TV series)|Lewis (TV series)}}\nThe Inspector Morse novels were made into a [[TV series]] (also called ''Inspector Morse'') for the British commercial TV network [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The series was made by [[Zenith Productions]] for [[Central Independent Television|Central]] (a company later acquired by [[Carlton Television|Carlton]]) and comprises 33&nbsp;two-hour episodes (100&nbsp;minutes excluding commercials)\u201420&nbsp;more episodes than there are novels\u2014produced between 1987 and 2000. The last episode was adapted from the final novel ''The Remorseful Day'', in which Morse dies.\n\nA spin-off series based on the television incarnation of [[Sergeant Lewis|Lewis]] was titled ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'' and began airing in 2006 and appeared until 2015.\n\nIn August 2011, ''ITV'' announced plans to film a [[prequel]] drama called ''[[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]]'', with author Colin Dexter's participation. English actor [[Shaun Evans]] was cast as a young Morse in his university days and early career.<ref>[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/oxford/9005186.Inspector_Morse_set_for_TV_comeback_as_young_man/ Inspector Morse set for TV comeback as young man], ''[[Oxford Mail]]'', 4 May 2011</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8681868/Inspector-Morse-is-an-enigma-lets-keep-him-that-way.html/ Inspector Morse is an enigma \u2013 let's keep him that way], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 5 August 2011</ref> The drama was broadcast on 2 January 2012 on ITV 1. Four new episodes were televised from 14 April 2013, showing Morse's early cases working for DI Fred Thursday and with [[Chief Superintendent Strange|Jim Strange]], his later boss, and pathologist Max De Bryn.  A second series of four episodes followed, screening in March and April 2014. In January 2016, the third series aired, also containing four episodes. A fourth series was aired, with four episodes, in January 2017. Filming of a fifth series of six episodes began in Spring 2017 with the first episode aired on 4 February 2018.\n\n===Radio===\nAn adaptation by Melville Jones of [[Last Bus to Woodstock]] featured in [[BBC Radio 4]]'s [[Saturday Night Theatre]] series in June 1985, with [[Andrew Burt]] as Morse and [[Christopher Douglas (British actor)|Christopher Douglas]] as Lewis.\n\nIn the 1990s, an occasional BBC Radio 4 series (for the Saturday Play) was made starring the voices of [[John Shrapnel]] as Morse and [[Robert Glenister]] as Lewis. The series was written by Guy Meredith and directed by [[Ned Chaillet]]. Episodes included: ''[[The Wench is Dead#Television and radio adaptations|The Wench is Dead]]'' (23 March 1992); ''[[Last Seen Wearing (Dexter novel)#Radio play|Last Seen Wearing]]'' (28 May 1994); and ''[[The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn#Radio play|The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn]]'' (10 February 1996).\n\n===Theatre===\nAn Inspector Morse stage play appeared in 2010, written by Alma Cullen (author of four Morse screenplays for ITV). The part of Morse was played by [[Colin Baker]]. The play, entitled ''Morse\u2014House of Ghosts'', saw DCI Morse looking to his past, when an old acquaintance becomes the lead suspect in a murder case that involves the on-stage death of a young actress. The play toured the UK from August to December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8831273054191/Inspector+Morse+Has+Stage+Debut+with+Colin+Baker.html |title=What's on Stage}}</ref> It was broadcast by [[BBC Radio 4]] on 25 March 2017 with [[Neil Pearson]] playing Morse and [[Lee Ingleby]] playing Lewis.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Allen, Paul and Jan, ''Endeavouring to Crack the Morse Code (Inspector Morse)'' Exposure Publishing (2006)\n* Bishop, David, ''The Complete Inspector Morse: From the Original Novels to the TV Series'' London: Reynolds & Hearn (2006)  {{ISBN|1-905287-13-5}}\n* Bird, Christopher, ''The World of Inspector Morse: A Complete A-Z Reference for the Morse Enthusiast  '' Foreword by [[Colin Dexter]]  London: Boxtree (1998) {{ISBN|0-7522-2117-5}}\n* Goodwin, Cliff, ''Inspector Morse Country : An Illustrated Guide to the World of Oxford's famous detective'' London: Headline (2002) {{ISBN|0-7553-1064-0}}\n* Leonard, Bill, ''The Oxford of Inspector Morse: Films Locations History'' Location Guides, Oxford (2004)  {{ISBN|0-9547671-1-X}}\n* Richards, Antony and Philip Attwell, ''The Oxford of Inspector Morse''\n* Richards, Antony, ''Inspector Morse On Location''\n* Sanderson, Mark, ''The Making of Inspector Morse'' Pan Macmillan (1995) {{ISBN|0-330-34418-8}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat| Inspector Morse}}\n*[http://www.visitoxfordandoxfordshire.com/official-tours/Types-of-Public-tours.aspx/ Inspector Morse Tour from Oxford Official Guided Walking Tours ] \n*[http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/oxfordtour/morses%5Foxford/ Morse's Oxford Online Tour (created by Oxford University)]\n\n{{InspectorMorse}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morse, Endeavour, Inspector}}\n[[Category:Fictional British police detectives]]\n[[Category:Oxford in fiction]]\n[[Category:Fictional English people]]\n[[Category:Inspector Morse| Morse, Endeavour]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1975]]\n[[Category:Characters in British novels of the 20th century]]", "sha1": "hyfhttp8qbplnzp7rkgog09q3apnbqm"}}, {"title": "History of the Isle of Man", "ns": "0", "id": "14763", "revision": {"id": "848042758", "parentid": "842404754", "timestamp": "2018-06-29T12:34:48Z", "contributor": {"username": "Chris j wood", "id": "82307"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Modern period */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{More citations needed|date=April 2018}}\nThe '''[[Isle of Man]]''' had become separated from Britain and Ireland by 6500 BC.

After becoming subject to Norwegian [[suzerainty]] as part of the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]], the Isle of Man later became a possession of the Scottish and then the English crowns.\n\nSince 1866, the Isle of Man has been a [[Crown Dependency]] and has [[Democracy|democratic]] [[self-government]].\n[[Image:Old House of Keys.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old House of Keys]], [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]]]]\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Image:Irish.Sea.at.Man.cross.section.jpg|thumb|150px|Cross-section of the Irish Sea through Man, showing sea levels.]]\n[[Image:CIIC 504.gif|thumb|150px|[[Ogham]] stone from the Isle of Man showing the ''droim'' in centre. Text reads BIVAIDONAS MAQI MUCOI CUNAVA[LI]; in English: Of Bivaidonas, son of the tribe Cunava[li].]]\n\n===Mesolithic===\nThe Isle of Man effectively became an island around 8,500 years ago at around the time when rising sea levels caused by the melting glaciers cut [[Mesolithic]] Britain off from continental Europe for the last time. A land bridge had earlier existed between the Isle of Man and Cumbria, but the location and opening of the land bridge remain poorly understood.<ref>''A New History of the Isle of Man Volume 1 - The Evolution of the Natural Landscape.'' edited by Richard Hiverrell and Geoffrey Thomas pp295-296 (1st Edition)(2006) Liverpool University Press {{ISBN|0-85323-587-2}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest traces of people on the Isle of Man date back to the Mesolithic Period, also known as the Middle Stone Age. The first residents lived in small natural shelters, [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting, gathering and fishing]] for their food. They used small tools made of [[flint]] or bone, examples of which have been found near the coast. Representatives of these artifacts are kept at the [[Manx National Heritage]] museum.\n\n===Neolithic to Bronze Age===\nThe [[Neolithic]] Period marked the coming of [[farming]], improved [[stone tool]]s and [[pottery]]. During this period [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] began to appear around the island. Examples are found at Cashtal yn Ard near [[Maughold]], King Orry's Grave in [[Laxey]], Meayll Circle near [[Cregneash]], and Ballaharra Stones in [[St John's, Isle of Man|St John's]]. The builders of the megaliths were not the only culture during this time; there are also remains of the local [[Ronaldsway culture]] (lasting from the late Neolithic into the Bronze Age)\n\n===Iron Age===\nThe [[Iron Age]] marked the beginning of [[Celts|Celtic]] cultural influence. Large [[hill fort]]s appeared on hill summits and smaller promontory forts along the coastal cliffs, whilst large timber-framed [[roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]] were built.\n\nIt is likely that the first Celts to inhabit the Island were [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] tribes from mainland Britain. The secular history of the Isle of Man during the Brythonic period remains mysterious. It is not known if the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] ever made a landing on the island; if they did, little evidence has been discovered; however there is evidence for contact with Roman Britain as an [[amphora]] was discovered at the settlement on the [[South Barrule]]; it is hypothesised this may have been trade goods or plunder. It has been speculated that the island may have become a haven for [[Druid]]s and other refugees from [[Anglesey]] after the sacking of [[Anglesey#History|Mona]] in AD 60.\n\nIt is generally assumed that Irish invasion or immigration formed the basis of the modern Manx language; Irish migration to the island probably began in the 5th century AD. This is evident in the change in language used in [[Ogham]] inscriptions. The transition between ''Manx Brythonic'' (a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic language]] like modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]]) and ''[[Manx Gaelic]]'' (a [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic language]] like modern [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]) may have been gradual. One question is whether the present-day Manx language survives from pre-Norse days or reflects a linguistic reintroduction after the Norse invasion. The island lends its name to ''[[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Manann\u00e1n]]'', the Brythonic and Gaelic sea god who is said in myth to have once ruled the island.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\nTradition attributes the island's conversion to Christianity to [[St Maughold]] (Maccul), an Irish missionary who gives his name to a parish. There are the remains of around 200 tiny early chapels called [[keeill|keeils]] scattered across the island. Evidence such as [[radiocarbon dating]] and [[magnetic drift]] points to many of these being built around AD 550-600.\n\nThe [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] culture of ''Manaw'' appears throughout early British tradition and later [[Medieval Welsh literature|Welsh writings]]. The family origins of [[Gwriad ap Elidyr]] (father of [[Merfyn Frych]] and grandfather of [[Rhodri the Great]]) are attributed to a ''Manaw'' and he is sometimes named as  ''Gwriad Manaw''.<ref name=Lloyd324>{{cite book |title=A History of Wales from the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest|last= Lloyd|first= John Edward|authorlink= John Edward Lloyd|coauthors= |year= 1912|publisher= Longmans, Green, and Co.|location= |isbn= |page= 324 and note |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYwNAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Gwriad&f=false |accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref> The 1896 discovery of a cross inscribed ''Crux Guriat'' (Cross of Gwriad) and dated to the 8th or 9th century greatly supports this theory.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Kermode|1897|pp=48&ndash;53}}, ''A Welsh Inscription in the Isle of Man''</ref>\n\nThe best record of any event before the incursions of the Northmen is attributed to [[B\u00e1et\u00e1n mac Cairill]], king of [[Ulster]], who (according to the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'') led an expedition to Man in 577-578, imposing his authority on the island (though some have thought this event may refer to [[Manaw Gododdin|Manau Gododdin]] between the Firths of [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] and [[Firth of Forth|Forth]], rather than the Isle of Man). After B\u00e1et\u00e1n's death in 581, his rival [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]], king of [[D\u00e1l Riata]], is said to have taken the island in 582.\n\nEven if the supposed conquest of the Menavian islands \u2013 Mann and [[Anglesey]] \u2013 by [[Edwin of Northumbria]], in 616, did take place, it could not have led to any permanent results, for when the English were driven from the coasts of [[Cumberland]] and [[Lancashire]] soon afterwards, they could not well have retained their hold on the island to the west of these coasts.{{fact|date=January 2017}} One can speculate, however, that when [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|Ecgfri\u00f0]]'s Northumbrians laid Ireland waste from Dublin to [[Drogheda]] in 684, they temporarily occupied Mann.\n\n===Viking Age and Norse kingdom===\n{{main|Kingdom of the Isles}}\nThe period of Scandinavian domination is divided into two main epochs \u2013 before and after the conquest of Mann by [[Godred Crovan]] in 1079. Warfare and unsettled rule characterise the earlier epoch; the later saw comparatively more peace.\n[[Image:Kingdom of Mann and the Isles-en.svg|thumb|right|The [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] about the year 1100. Sodor and Mann in red.]]\nBetween about AD 800 and 815 the Vikings came to Mann chiefly for plunder; between about 850 and 990, when they settled there, the island fell under the rule of the Scandinavian [[Kings of Dublin]]; and between 990 and 1079, it became subject to the powerful [[Earl of Orkney|Earls of Orkney]].\n\nThere was a mint producing coins on Mann between c. 1025 and c. 1065. These Manx coins were minted from an imported type 2 [[Hiberno-Norse]] penny die from [[Dublin]]. Hiberno-Norse coins were first minted under Sihtric, [[King of Dublin]]. This illustrates that Mann may have been under the thumb of Dublin at this time.\n\nThe conqueror [[Godred Crovan]] was evidently a remarkable man, though little is known about him. According to the ''Chronicon Manniae'' he subdued Dublin, and a great part of [[Leinster]], and held the Scots in such subjection that supposedly no one who set out to build a vessel dared to insert more than three bolts. The memory of such a ruler would be likely to survive in tradition, and it seems probable therefore that he is the person commemorated in Manx legend under the name of King Gorse or Orry. He created the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] in around 1079; it included the south-western islands of Scotland until 1164, when two separate kingdoms were formed from it. In 1154, what was later to be known as the [[Diocese of Sodor and Man]] was formed by the [[Catholic Church]].\n\nThe islands which were under his rule were called the ''Su\u00f0r-eyjar'' (south isles, in contradistinction to the ''Nor\u00f0r-eyjar'', or the \"north isles\", i.e. Orkney and [[Shetland]]), and they consisted of the [[Hebrides]], and of all the smaller western islands of [[Scotland]], and Mann. At a later date his successors took the title of {{lang|la|Rex Manniae et Insularum}} ([[King of Mann and the Isles|King of Mann and of the Isles]]). The kingdom's capital was on [[St Patrick's Isle]], where [[Peel Castle]] was built on the site of a Celtic monastery.\n\n[[Olaf I Godredsson|Olaf]], Godred's son, exercised considerable power, and according to the Chronicle, maintained such close alliance with the kings of Ireland and Scotland that no one ventured to disturb the Isles during his time (1113\u20131152). In 1156, his son, [[Godred II Olafsson|Godred]] (reigned 1153\u20131158), who for a short period ruled over Dublin also, lost the smaller islands off the coast of Argyll as a result of a quarrel with [[Somerled]] (the ruler of [[Argyll]]). An independent sovereignty thus appeared between{{clarifyme|date=January 2017}} the two divisions of his kingdom.\n\nIn the 1130s the Catholic Church sent a small mission to establish the first [[Diocese|bishopric]] on the Isle of Man, and appointed [[Wimund]] as the first bishop. He soon afterwards embarked with a band of followers on a career of murder and looting throughout Scotland and the surrounding islands.\n\nDuring the whole of the Scandinavian period, the Isles remained nominally under the suzerainty of the [[Kings of Norway]], but the Norwegians only occasionally asserted it with any vigour. The first such king to assert control over the region was likely [[Magnus III of Norway|Magnus Barelegs]], at the turn of the 12th century. It was not until Hakon Hakonarson's 1263 expedition that another king returned to the Isles.\n\n===Decline of Norse rule===\n[[File:NW Britain 11th cent.jpg|300px|thumb|left|11th century (north is to the right)]]\n\nFrom the middle of the 12th century until 1217 the suzerainty had remained of a very shadowy character; Norway had become a prey to civil dissensions. But after that date it became a reality, and Norway consequently came into collision with the growing power of the [[kingdom of Scotland]].\n\nEarly in the 13th century, when [[Ragnald IV of the Isle of Man|Ragnald]] (reigned 1187\u20131229) paid homage to King [[John of England]] (reigned 1199\u20131216), we hear for the first time of English intervention in the affairs of Mann. But a period of Scots domination would precede the establishment of full English control.\n\nFinally, in 1261, [[Alexander III of Scotland]] sent envoys to Norway to negotiate for the cession of the isles, but their efforts led to no result. He therefore initiated a war, which ended in the indecisive [[Battle of Largs]] against the Norwegian fleet in 1263. However, the Norwegian king [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon Haakonsson]] died the following winter, and this allowed King Alexander to bring the war to a successful conclusion. [[Magnus Olafsson|Magnus Olafsson, King of Mann and the Isles]] (reigned 1252\u20131265), who had campaigned on the Norwegian side, had to surrender all the islands over which he had ruled, except Mann, for which he did [[homage (feudal)|homage]]. Two years later Magnus died and in 1266 King [[Magnus VI of Norway]] ceded the islands, including Mann, to Scotland in the [[Treaty of Perth]] in consideration of the sum of 4,000 [[Mark (money)|marks]] (known as {{lang|sco|merks}} in Scotland) and an [[annuity]] of 100 marks. But Scotland's rule over Mann did not become firmly established till 1275, when the Manx suffered defeat in the decisive [[Battle of Ronaldsway]], near [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]].\n\n===English dominance===\nIn 1290 King [[Edward I of England]] sent [[Walter de Huntercombe, 1st Baron Huntercombe|Walter de Huntercombe]] to seize possession of Mann, and it remained in English hands until 1313, when [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]] took it after besieging [[Castle Rushen]] for five weeks. In about 1333 King [[Edward III of England]] granted Mann to [[William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury|William de Montacute]], 3rd [[Baron]] Montacute (later the 1st [[Earl of Salisbury]]), as his absolute possession, without reserving any service to be rendered to him. \n\nThen, in 1346, the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]] decided the long struggle between England and Scotland in England's favour. King [[David II of Scotland]], Robert Bruce's last male heir, had been captured in the Battle of Neville's cross and ransomed; however, when Scotland was unable to raise one of the ransom installments, David made a secret agreement with King [[Edward III of England]] to cancel it, in return for transferring the Scottish kingdom to an English prince.\n\nFollowing the secret agreement, there followed a confused period when Mann sometimes suffered English rule and sometimes Scottish. In 1388 the island was \"ravaged\" by [[Sir William Douglas of Nithsdale]] on his way home from the destruction of the town of [[Carlingford, County Louth|Carlingford]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/douglasbook01fras#page/899/mode/2up The Douglas book<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \n\nIn 1392 William de Montacute's son sold the island, including sovereignty, to Sir [[William le Scrope]]. In 1399 [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolinbroke]] brought about the beheading of Le Scrope, who had taken the side of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] when Bolinbroke usurped the throne and appointed himself ''Henry IV''. The island then came into the de facto possession of Henry, who granted it to [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]]; but following the latter's later attainder, Henry IV, in 1405, made a lifetime grant of it, with the patronage of the bishopric, to Sir [[John I Stanley of the Isle of Man|John Stanley]]. In 1406 this grant was extended \u2013 on a [[feudatory]] basis under the English Crown \u2013 to Sir John's heirs and assigns, the feudal fee being the service of rendering [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] and [[tribute|two falcons]] to all future Kings of England on their [[coronation]]s.\n\n==Early Modern period==\nWith the accession of the Stanleys to the throne there begins a more settled epoch in Manx history. Though the island's new rulers rarely visited its shores, they placed it under governors, who, in the main, seem to have treated it with the justice of the time. Of the thirteen members of the family who ruled in Mann, the second [[John II Stanley of the Isle of Man|Sir John Stanley]] (1414\u20131432), [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby|James, the 7th Earl]] (1627\u20131651), and the [[James Stanley, 10th Earl of Derby|10th Earl of the same name]] (1702\u20131736) had the most important influence on it. They first curbed the power of the spiritual barons{{clarifyme|date=January 2017}}, introduced trial by jury, which superseded [[trial by battle]], and ordered the laws to be written. The second, known as the Great Stanley, and his wife, [[Charlotte Stanley, Countess of Derby|Charlotte de la Tremoille]] (or Tremouille), are probably the most striking figures in Manx history.\n\n===English Civil War and Interregnum===\nIn 1643 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ordered [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby]] to go to Mann, where the people, no doubt influenced by events in England, threatened to revolt.\n\nStanley's arrival, with English soldiers, soon put a stop to anything of this kind. He conciliated the people by his affability, brought in Englishmen to teach various handicrafts and tried to help the farmers by improving the breed of Manx horses, and, at the same time, he restricted the exactions of the Church. But the Manx also lost much of their liberty under his rule: they were heavily taxed; troops were quartered upon them; and they also had the more lasting grievance of being compelled to accept leases for three lifetimes instead of holding their land by the straw tenure, which they considered to be equivalent to a customary inheritance.\n\nSix months after the death of Charles I (on 30 January 1649), Stanley received a summons from [[Henry Ireton|General Ireton]] to surrender the island, but he declined to do so. In August 1651 Stanley went to England with some of his troops, among whom were 300 Manxmen, to join [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. Charles was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Worcester]] and Stanley was captured, imprisoned in [[Chester Castle]] and then tried by [[court-martial]] and executed at [[Bolton]].\n\n===Rebellion===\nSoon after Stanley's death, the Manx Militia, under the command of William Christian (known by his [[Manx language|Manx]] name of [[Illiam Dhone]]), rose against the Countess and captured all the insular forts except Rushen and Peel. They were then joined by a Parliamentary force under [[Robert Duckenfield|Colonel Duckenfield]], to whom the Countess surrendered after a brief resistance.\n\n[[Oliver Cromwell]] had appointed [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]] \"Lord of Mann and the Isles\" in September 1651, so that Mann continued under a monarchical government and remained in the same relation to England as before.\n\n===Restoration of the Stanleys===\nThe restoration of Stanley government in 1660 therefore caused as little friction and alteration as its temporary cessation had. One of the first acts of the new Lord, [[Charles Stanley, 8th Earl of Derby]], was to order Christian to be tried. He was found guilty and executed. Of the other persons implicated in the rebellion only three were excepted from the general amnesty. But by [[Order in Council]], Charles II pardoned them, and the judges responsible for the sentence on Christian were punished.\n\nCharles Stanley's next act was to dispute the permanency of the tenants' holdings, which they had not at first regarded as being affected by the acceptance of leases, a proceeding which led to an almost open rebellion against his authority and to the neglect of agriculture, in lieu of which the people devoted themselves to the fisheries and to contraband trade.\n\nCharles Stanley, who died in 1672, was succeeded first by his son William Richard George Stanley, 9th Earl of Derby until his death in 1702.\n\nThe agrarian question subsided only in 1704, when [[James Stanley, 10th Earl of Derby]], William's brother and successor, largely through the influence of [[Thomas Wilson (bishop)|Bishop Wilson]], entered into a compact with his tenants, which became embodied in an Act, called the [[Act of Settlement 1703|Act of Settlement]]. Their compact secured the tenants in the possession of their estates in perpetuity subject only to a fixed rent, and a small fine on succession or [[Alienation (property law)|alienation]]. From the great importance of this act to the Manx people it has been called their ''[[Magna Carta]]''. As time went on, and the value of the estates increased, the rent payable to the Lord became so small in proportion as to be almost nominal, being extinguished by purchase in 1916.\n\n===Revestment===\nJames died in 1736, and the [[suzerainty]] of the isle passed to [[James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl]], his first cousin and heir-male. In 1764 he was succeeded by his only surviving child [[Charlotte Murray, Duchess of Atholl|Charlotte, Baroness Strange]], and her husband, [[John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl|John Murray]], who (in right of his wife) became [[Lord of Mann]]. In about 1720 the contraband trade had greatly increased. In 1726 [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] had checked it somewhat for a time, but during the last ten years of the Atholl regime (1756\u20131765) it assumed such proportions that, in the interests of the Imperial revenue, it became necessary to suppress it. With a view to so doing, Parliament passed the [[Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765]] (commonly called the ''Revestment Act'' by the Manx), under which it purchased the rights of the Atholls as [[Lord of Mann|Lords of Mann]], including the customs revenues of the island, for the sum of \u00a370,000 [[pound sterling|sterling]], and granted an [[annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] to the Duke and Duchess. The Atholls still retained their [[manorialism|manorial]] rights, the patronage of the [[Bishop of Sodor and Man|bishopric]], and certain other [[wikt:perquisites|perquisites]], until they sold them for the sum of \u00a3417,144 in 1828.\n[[File:Iom mnh 1954 7451 large.jpg|thumb|The scene in Ramsey Bay after the [[Battle of Bishops Court]] between the English and French squadrons, enacted off the Manx coast in 1760]]\n\nUp to the time of the [[wikt:revestment|revestment]], [[Tynwald]] had passed laws concerning the government of the island in all respects and had control over its finances, subject to the approval of the Lord of Mann. After the revestment, or rather after the passage of the [[Smuggling Act 1765]] (commonly called the Mischief Act by the Manx), the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at Westminster legislated with respect to customs, harbours and merchant shipping, and, in measures of a general character, it occasionally inserted clauses permitting the enforcement in the island of penalties in contravention of the Acts of which they formed part. It also assumed the control of the insular customs duties. Such changes, rather than the transference of the full [[suzerainty]] to the King of Great Britain and Ireland, modified the (unwritten) constitution of the Isle of Man. Its ancient laws and tenures remained untouched, but in many ways the revestment affected it adversely. The hereditary [[Lord of Mann|Lords of Mann]] had seldom, if ever, functioned as model rulers, but most of them had taken some personal share in its government, and had interested themselves in the well-being of the inhabitants. But now the whole direction of its affairs became the work of officials who regarded the island as a pestilent nest of smugglers, from which it seemed their duty to extract as much revenue as possible.\n\nThere was some alleviation of this state of things between 1793 and 1826, when [[John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl]] served as [[Governor of the Isle of Man|Governor]], since, though he quarrelled with the [[House of Keys]] and unduly cared for his own pecuniary interests, he did occasionally exert himself to promote the welfare of the island. After his departure the English officials resumed their sway, but they showed more consideration than before. Moreover, since smuggling, which the [[Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765|Isle of Man Purchase Act]] had only checked \u2013 not suppressed \u2013 had by that time almost disappeared, and since the Manx revenue had started to produce a large and increasing surplus, the authorities looked more favourably on the Isle of Man, and, thanks to this fact and to the representations of the Manx people to British ministers in 1837, 1844 and 1853, it obtained a somewhat less stringent customs [[tariff]] and an occasional [[wikt:dole|dole]] towards erecting its much neglected public works.\n\n==Modern period==\nSince 1866, when the Isle of Man obtained a nominal measure of [[home rule|Home Rule]], the Manx people have made remarkable progress, and currently form a prosperous community, with a thriving [[offshore financial centre]], a [[tourism|tourist]] industry (albeit smaller than in the past) and a variety of other industries.\n\nThe Isle of Man was a base for alien civilian [[internment]] camps in both the [[First World War]] (1914\u201318) and the [[Second World War]] (1939\u201345). During the First World War there were two camps: one a requisitioned holiday camp in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] and the other the purpose-built [[Knockaloe internment camp|Knockaloe camp]] near [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]] in the parish of [[Patrick (parish)|Patrick]]. During the Second World War there were a number of smaller camps in Douglas, Peel, [[Port Erin]] and [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]]. The (now disbanded) [[Manx Regiment]] was raised in 1938 and saw action during the Second World War.\n\nOn 2 August 1973, a [[Summerland disaster|flash fire killed between 50 and 53 people]] at the Summerland amusement centre in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/2/newsid_2526000/2526967.stm 1973: Dozens die in resort fire, BBC News item]</ref>\n\n===Greater autonomy===\nThe early 20th century saw a revival of music, dance, and a limited revival of the [[Manx language]], although the last \"native\" speaker of Manx Gaelic died in the 1970s. In the middle of the 20th century, the [[Taoiseach]], [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], visited, and was so dissatisfied with the lack of support for Manx that he immediately had two recording vans sent over. During the 20th century the Manx tourist economy declined, as the English and Irish started flying to [[Spain]] for [[package holiday]]s. The Manx Government responded to this by successfully promoting the island, with its low tax rates, as an offshore financial centre, although it has avoided being placed on a recent UK black list of tax havens.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/isle_of_man/8030546.stm BBC NEWS | Europe | Isle of Man | UK praises Manx tax list status<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The financial centre has had its detractors who have pointed to the potential for [[money laundering]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/24/business/international-business-undercurrents-safe-harbor-isle-man-corporations-enclave.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Undercurrents at a Safe Harbor; Isle of Man (and Corporations) Is an Enclave of Intrigue - New York Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 1949 an [[Executive Council of the Isle of Man|Executive Council]], chaired by the [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|Lieutenant-Governor]] and including members of [[Tynwald]], was created. This was the start of a transfer of executive power from the unelected Lieutenant Governor to democratically elected Manx politicians. Finance and the police passed to Manx control between 1958 and 1976.<ref>Finance Act 1958, Finance Act 1962, Police (Isle of Man) Act 1962, Governor's Financial and Judicial Functions (Transfer) Act 1976: ''Statutes of the Isle of Man''</ref> In 1980 the Lieutenant Governor was replaced as Chairman of the Executive Council by a chairman elected by Tynwald.<ref>Constitution (Executive Council) (Amendment) Act 1980</ref> Following legislation in 1984, the Executive Council was reconstituted in 1985 to include the chairmen of the eight principal Boards;<ref>Constitution (Executive Council) Act 1984</ref> in 1986 they were given the title of Minister and the chairman was retitled Chief Minister.<ref>Constitution (Executive Council) (Amendment) Act 1986</ref> In 1986 [[Miles Walker|Sir Miles Walker CBE]] became the first [[Chief Minister of the Isle of Man]]. In 1990 the Executive Council was renamed the Council of Ministers.<ref>Council of Ministers Act 1990</ref>\n\nThe 1960s also saw a rise in Manx nationalism, spawning the parties [[Mec Vannin]] and the [[Manx National Party]], as well as the now defunct {{lang|gv|Fo Halloo}} (literally \"Underground\"), which mounted a direct-action campaign of spray-painting and attempted house-burning.\n\nOn 5 July 1973, control of the postal service passed from the UK [[General Post Office]] to the new [[Isle of Man Post]], which began to issue its own [[postage stamp]]s.\n\nThe 1990s and early 21st century have seen a greater recognition of indigenous Manx culture, including the opening of the first Manx language primary school, as well as a general re-evaluation of the island's economy.\n\nFrom 1983 on, the Isle of Man government has designated more than 250 historic structures as [[Registered Buildings of the Isle of Man]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Isle of Man|History}}\n{{History of the British Isles}}\n* [[King of Mann and the Isles]] (1079\u20131164)\n* [[King of Mann]] (1164\u20131504)\n* [[Lord of Mann]] (1504\u20131765)\n* [[Act of Settlement 1703]]\n* [[Governor of the Isle of Man]] (1696\u20131828)\n* [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man]] (1773\u2013present)\n* [[Wimund]] - 12th century, first Bishop of the Isle of Man, warlord\n* [[List of concentration and internment camps#Isle of Man|Internment camps in the Isle of Man]]\n* [[Extinct animals from the Isle of Man]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Man, Isle of|volume=17|pages=534\u2013539}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Chiverrell, R. and G.

It is a British [[Crown dependency]]. It has a small [[islet]], the [[Calf of Man]], to its south. It is located at {{Coord|54|15|N|4|30|W|region:IM_type:country}}.\n\n==Dimensions==\n[[File:Isle of man satellite image.JPG|thumb|left|Satellite image]]\n\n'''Area:'''\n\n<br>''Land:''\n{{convert|571|km2|sqmi+ha|abbr=on}}\n<br>''Water:''\n{{convert|1|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} (100 ha)\n<br>''Total:''\n{{convert|572|km2|sqmi+ha|abbr=on}}\n\nThis makes it:\n*slightly more than three times the size of [[Washington, DC]]\n*slightly more than one third the size of [[Hertfordshire]]\n*slightly smaller than [[Saint Lucia]].\n\n==Coast and Territorial Sea==\nThe Isle of Man has a coastline of {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and a territorial sea extending to a maximum of 12 [[Nautical mile|nm]] from the coast, or the midpoint between other countries. The total territorial sea area is about 4000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 1500 sq miles, which is about 87% of the total area of the jurisdiction of the Isle of Man.

Average rainfall is high compared to the majority of the [[British Isles]], due to its location to the western side of Great Britain and sufficient distance from [[Ireland]] for moisture to be accumulated by the prevailing south-westerly winds. Average rainfall is highest at [[Snaefell]], where it is around {{convert|1900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} a year.

As a [[Crown Dependency]], it is not subordinate to the government of the United Kingdom. That government, however, is responsible for defence and external affairs and could intervene in the domestic affairs of the island under its residual responsibilities to guarantee \"good government\" in all [[Crown dependencies]]. The [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Monarch of the United Kingdom]] is also the [[head of state]] of the Isle of Man, and generally referred to as \"The Queen, [[Lord of Mann]]\".<ref>http://www.gov.im/categories/business-and-industries/iom-key-facts-guide/</ref> Legislation of the Isle of Man defines \"[[the Crown]] in right of the Isle of Man\" as separate from the \"Crown in right of the United Kingdom\".<ref>[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=3&parentActiveTextDocId=3312343&ActiveTextDocId=3312364&filesize=13636 The Air Navigation (Isle of Man) Order 2007 (No. 1115)]</ref> Her representative on the island is the [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man]], but his role is mostly ceremonial, though he does have the power to grant [[Royal Assent]] (the withholding of which is the same as a [[veto]]).\n\nAlthough the Isle of Man is not part of the [[United Kingdom]], [[Manx people|its people]]  are [[British nationality law#British citizenship|British citizens]] under [[UK law]] \u2014 there is no separate [[Manx people|Manx]] citizenship. The United Kingdom is responsible for all the [[External relations of the Isle of Man|island's external affairs]], including citizenship, defence, [[good governance]], and foreign relations. The island has no representation at either the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK]] or [[European Parliament|EU]] [[parliament]]s.\n\nThe [[legislative power]] of the government is vested in a bicameral (sometimes called tricameral) parliament called [[Tynwald]] (said to be the world's oldest ''continuously existing'' parliament), which consists of the directly-elected [[House of Keys]] and the indirectly chosen [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]]. After every House of Keys [[general election]], the members of Tynwald elect from amongst themselves the [[Chief Minister of the Isle of Man]], who serves as the [[head of government]] for five years (until the next general election). [[Executive power]] is vested in the Lieutenant Governor (as [[Governor-in-Council]]), the Chief Minister, and the Isle of Man's [[Council of Ministers of the Isle of Man|Council of Ministers]].  The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n[[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], the largest town on the Isle of Man, is its [[Capital (political)|capital]] and [[seat of government]], where the Government offices and the parliament chambers ([[Tynwald]]) are located.\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{main|Isle of Man Government}}\nThe [[Head of State]] is the [[Lord of Mann]], which is a hereditary position held by the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] (currently [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]). The [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|Lieutenant Governor]] is appointed by the Queen, on the advice of the UK's [[Secretary of State for Justice]], for a five-year term and nominally exercises executive power on behalf of the Queen. The [[Chief Minister of the Isle of Man|Chief Minister]] is elected by [[Tynwald]] following every House of Keys general election and serves for five years until the next [[general election]].\n\nWhen acting as Lord of Mann, the Queen acts on the advice of the [[Secretary of State for Justice|Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom]] having prime responsibility as Privy Counsellor for Manx affairs.<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandCrowndependencies/IsleofMan.aspx The Monarchy Today > Queen and State > Queen and Crown dependencies > Isle of Man<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe executive branch under the Chief Minister is referred to as \"the Government\" or the \"Civil Service\", and consists of  the  [[Council of Ministers of the Isle of Man|Council of Ministers]], nine Departments, ten Statutory Boards and three Offices.  Each Department is run by a Minister who reports directly to the Council of Ministers.  The Civil Service has more than 2000 employees and the total number of public sector employees including the Civil Service, teachers, nurses, police, etc. is about 9000 people. This is somewhat more than 10% of the population of the Island, and a full 23% of the working population. This does not include any [[military]] forces, as defence is the responsibility of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Tynwald}}\nThe Manx [[legislature]] is [[Tynwald]], which consists of two [[bicameralism|chambers]]. The [[House of Keys]] has 24 members, elected for a five-year term in two-seat [[House of Keys constituencies|constituencies]] by the whole island. The minimum voting age is 16. The [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] has eleven members: the [[President of Tynwald]], the [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]], the [[Attorney General (Isle of Man)|Attorney General]] (non-voting) and eight other members elected by the House of Keys for a five-year term, with four retiring at a time. (In the past they have often already been Members of the House of Keys, but must leave the Keys if elected to the Council.) There are also joint sittings of the Tynwald Court (the two houses together).\n\n===Political parties and elections===\nIn the 2016 Manx general election, on 22 September, the [[Liberal Vannin Party]] won three seats, tying their 2011 results; all 21 remaining seats were won by independents.<ref>[[Manx general election, 2016]]</ref> However one of those three members now sits as an independent. 12 of the 24 MHKs were newly elected to office. Turnout slightly improved from 2011 with 56% of eligible voters turning out, ranging from 40% in [[Douglas East]] to 65% in [[Ayre & Michael]].\n\nMost Manx politicians stand for election as independents rather than as representatives of political parties. Though political parties do exist, their influence is not nearly as strong as in the United Kingdom. Consequently, much Manx legislation develops through consensus among the members of Tynwald, which contrasts with the much more adversarial nature of the British [[Parliament]].\n\nThe largest political party is the Liberal Vannin Party, which promotes [[liberalism]], greater Manx independence and more accountability in Government.\n\nA [[Manx Labour Party]] also exists, unaffiliated to the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Its candidates won a combined 1.4% of the overall vote in 2016, however it holds 2 seats on the Legislative Council.\n\nA political pressure group [[Mec Vannin]] advocates the establishment of a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[republic]].\n\nThe [[Isle of Man Green Party]], which was founded in 2016, holds 2 local government seats and promotes [[Green politics]].\n\nThe island also formerly had a [[Manx National Party]]. There are Manx members in the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]], a political pressure group that advocates greater co-operation between and political autonomy for the [[Modern Celts|Celtic]] nations.\n\nThe main political issues include the Island's relationship with the finance sector, housing prices and shortages, and the [[Manx language]].\n\n===Intervention of the United Kingdom===\n{{details|External relations of the Isle of Man}}\nThe UK Parliament has paramount power to legislate for the Isle of Man on all matters, but it is a long-standing convention that it does not do so on domestic (\"insular\") matters without Tynwald's consent.<ref>[http://www.gov.im/about-the-government/offices/cabinet-office/external-relations/crown-services/office-of-lieutenant-governor/ The Office of the Lieutenant Governor - Isle of Man Government Chief Secretary's Office<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOccasionally, the UK Parliament acts against the wishes of Tynwald: the most recent example was the [[Marine etc. Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967]], which banned pirate radio stations from operating in Manx waters. Legislation to accomplish this was defeated on its second reading in the House of Keys, prompting Westminster to legislate directly.\n\nThe UK's [[secondary legislation]] (regulations and [[Statutory Instruments]]) cannot be extended to apply to the Isle of Man.\n\nThe Isle of Man is subject to certain European Union laws, by virtue of a being a territory for which the UK has responsibility in international law. These laws are those for areas not covered by the Protocol 3 opt-out that the UK obtained for the Isle of Man in its accession treaty: the excluded areas are free movement of persons, services and capital, and taxation and social policy harmonisation.\n\nThe UK has had several disputes with the [[European Court of Human Rights]] about the Isle of Man's laws concerning [[birching]] (corporal punishment) and [[sodomy]].\n\n==Judicial branch==\nThe lowest courts in the [[Isle of Man]] are presided over by the [[High Bailiff]] and the [[High Bailiff|Deputy High Bailiff]], along with lay [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]].  The [[Isle of Man High Court|High Court of Justice]] consists of three civil divisions and is presided over by a [[Deemster]].  Appeals are dealt with by the [[Staff of Government Division]] with final appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  The head of the Judiciary is the [[Deemster|First Deemster and Clerk of the Rolls]].  The other High and Appeal Court Judges are the [[Deemster|Second Deemster]], [[Deemster|Deputy Deemster]] and [[Judge of Appeal]], all of whom are appointed by the [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|Lieutenant Governor]].\n\nThe [[Isle of Man High Court#Court of General Gaol Delivery|Court of General Gaol Delivery]] is the criminal court for serious offences (effectively the equivalent of a [[Crown Court]] in England). It is theoretically not part of the High Court, but is effectively the criminal division of the court. The Second Deemster normally sits as the judge in this court. In 1992, His Honour [[Henry Callow|Deemster Callow]] passed the last-ever sentence of death in a court in the [[British Islands]] (which was commuted to life imprisonment). [[Capital punishment in the Isle of Man]] was formally abolished by [[Tynwald]] in 1993 (although the last execution on the island took place in 1872).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gov.im Isle of Man Government]\n*[http://www.tynwald.org.im Tynwald - The Parliament of the Isle of Man]\n*[http://www.iomelections.com iomelections.com - 2006 General Election]\n\n{{British-Irish Council}}\n{{Politics of Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Politics of the Isle of Man| ]]\n[[Category:Government of the Isle of Man| ]]", "sha1": "5g24hirglri8cj88notkhmdxadvd02l"}}, {"title": "Economy of the Isle of Man", "ns": "0", "id": "14767", "revision": {"id": "846686209", "parentid": "822630106", "timestamp": "2018-06-20T08:38:04Z", "contributor": {"username": "KolbertBot", "id": "31691822"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Bot: [[User:KolbertBot|HTTP\u2192HTTPS]] (v485)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:BritishIslesMan.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Location of the Isle of Man within the [[British Isles]]]]\nThe [[Isle of Man]], one of the [[Crown dependencies]], is a low-tax economy and [[offshore financial centre]].

In August 1859, a {{convert|36|nmi|adj=on}} long cable was commissioned from Glass, Elliot and Company of Greenwich and laid from [[Cranstal]] (north of [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]]) to [[St Bees]] in Cumbria using the chartered cable ship ''Resolute''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stbees.org.uk/misc/telegraph.htm|title=St Bees|work=archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121100924/http://www.stbees.org.uk/misc/telegraph.htm|archivedate=2012-01-21|df=}}</ref> The cable was single-core, with [[gutta-percha]] insulation.\n\nTwenty miles of overhead cable were also erected from Cranstal south to Ramsey, and on to Douglas. In England, the telegraph was connected to [[Whitehaven]] and the circuits of the [[Electric Telegraph Company]].\n\nThe telegraph offices were located at 64 Athol Street, [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] (also the company's head office) and at East Quay, Ramsey (now Marina House).<ref>Thwaite's Directory 1863</ref>\n\nOn 10 August 1860 the company was statutorily incorporated by an [[Act of Tynwald]] with a capital of \u00a35,500.\n\nThe currents at Cranstal proved too strong, and in 1864 the cable was taken up and relaid further south, at [[Port-e-Vullen]] in Ramsey Bay. It was later relaid to land even further south at Port Cornaa.\n\nFollowing the 1869 finalisation of UK telegraph nationalisation into a [[General Post Office]] monopoly, the Isle of Man Telegraph Company was nationalised in 1870 under the [[Telegraph Act 1870]] (an Act of Parliament) at a cost to the British Government of \u00a316,106 (paid in 1872 following arbitration proceedings over the value). Prior to nationalisation, the island's telegraph operations had been performing poorly and the company's share price valued it at around \u00a3100.\n\nSubsequent to nationalisation, operations were taken over by the GPO. The internal telegraph system was extended within a year to Castletown and Peel, however by then the previous lack of modern communications in Castletown had already started the Isle of Man Government on its move to Douglas.\n\nDue to increasing usage in the years following nationalisation, further cables between Port Cornaa and St Bees were laid in 1875 and 1885.\n\nBy 1883 Smith's Directory listed several telegraph offices operated by the Post Office, in addition to those at Douglas, Ramsey, Castletown and Peel the telegraph was also available at Laxey, Ballaugh, and Port St. Mary.\n\nThroughout the First World War, the cable landing station at Port Cornaa was guarded by the [[Isle of Man Volunteer Corps]].\n\nThe undersea telegraph cables have been disused since the 1950s, but remain in place.\n\n===Teleport===\nA Teleport, with several earth stations, is currently under construction on the Isle of Man. SES Satellite Leasing, the entrepreneurial investment arm of [https://www.ses.com/ SES]. The teleport is expected to enter into service in 2017. It will be a state-of-the-art facility providing satellite telemetry, tracking and commanding (TT&C) facilities and capacity management, together with a wide range of teleport services such as uplink, downlink, and contribution services for broadcasters and data centres.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ses.com/press-release/ses-build-new-teleport-isle-man|title=SES TO BUILD NEW TELEPORT ON ISLE OF MAN|last=|first=|date=8 September 2016|website=www.ses.com|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Telephones===\nThe main telephone provider on the Isle of Man today is [[Manx Telecom]].\n\nIn 1889 George Gillmore, formerly an electrician for the GPO's Manx telegraph operations, was granted a licence by the Postmaster General to operate the Isle of Man's first [[telephone]] service. Based in an exchange in Athol Street, early customers of Gilbert's telephone service included the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]] and the [[Isle of Man Railway]]. Not having the resources to fund expansion or a link to England, Gillmore sold his licence to the [[National Telephone Company]] and stayed on as their manager on the island.\n\nBy 1901 there were 600 subscribers, and the telephone system had been extended to Ramsey, Castletown, Peel, Port Erin, Port St. Mary and Onchan.\n\nOn 1 January 1912 the National Telephone Company was nationalised and merged into the General Post Office by the [[Telephone Transfer Act 1911]]. Only [[Guernsey]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] remained outside of the GPO.\n\nIn 1922, the General Post Office offered to sell the island's telephone service to the Manx government, but the offer was not taken up. A similar arrangement in Jersey for that island's telephone service was concluded in 1923.\n\nThe first off-island telephone link was established in 1929, with the laying of a cable by the ''CS Faraday'' between [[Port Erin]] and [[Ballyhornan]] in Northern Ireland, a distance of 57&nbsp;km, and then between [[Port Grenaugh]] and [[Blackpool]], primarily to provide a link to Northern Ireland. The cable was completed on 6 June 1929 and the first call between the Isle of Man and the outside world was made on 28 June 1929 by [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|Lieutenant Governor]] Sir Claude Hill in Douglas to the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]] in Liverpool. The cable initially carried only two trunk circuits.\n\nIn 1942, a pioneering VHF frequency-modulated radio-link was established between [[Creg-na-Baa]] and the UK to provide an alternative to the sub-sea cable. This has since been discontinued.\n\nThis was augmented on 24 June 1943 by a {{convert|74|km|adj=on}} long cable between [[Cemaes Bay]] in [[Anglesey]] and [[Port Erin]], which had the world's first submerged repeater, laid by ''HMCS Iris''. The repeater doubled the possible number of circuits on the cable, and although it failed after only five months, its replacement worked for seven years.\n\nIn 1962 a further undersea cable was laid by ''HMTS Ariel'' between [[Colwyn Bay]] and the Island.\n\nHistorically, the telephone system on the Isle of Man had been run as a monopoly by the British [[General Post Office]], and later [[British Telecommunications]], and operated as part of the Liverpool telephone district.\n\nBy 1985 the privatised British Telecom had inherited the telephone operations of the GPO, including those on the Isle of Man. At this time the Manx Government announced that it would award a 20-year licence to operate the telephone system in a tender process. As part of this process, in 1986 British Telecom created a Manx-registered subsidiary company, Manx Telecom, to bid for the tender. It was believed that a local identity and management would be more politically acceptable in the tendering process as they competed with [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable & Wireless]] to win the licence. Manx Telecom won the tender, and commenced operations under the new identity from 1 January 1987.\n\nOn 28 March 1988 an 8,000 telephone circuit [[fibre optic]] cable, the longest unregenerated system in Europe, was inaugurated. In links Port Grenaugh to [[Silecroft]] in Cumbria, and was laid in September 1987. The cable was buried in the seabed along its entire length.\n\nA further fibre optic cable, known as BT-MT1 was laid in October 1990 between [[Millom]] in Cumbria and [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], a distance of {{convert|43|nmi|km}}. Jointly operated by BT and Manx Telecom, it provides six channels each with a bandwidth of 140 [[Mbit/s]]. This cable remains in use today.\n\nIn July 1992, [[Mercury Communications]] laid the LANIS fibre-optic cables. LANIS-1 runs for {{convert|61|nmi|km}} between Port Grenaugh and Blackpool, and LANIS-2 runs for {{convert|36|nmi|km}} between the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland. They have six channels each with a bandwidth of 565 Mbit/s. The LANIS cables are now operated by [[Cable & Wireless Worldwide|Cable & Wireless]]. The LANIS-1 cable was damaged 600 m off Port Grenaugh on 27 November 2006, causing loss of the link and resulting in temporary Internet access issues for some Manx customers whilst it was awaiting repair.\n\nOn 17 November 2001 Manx Telecom became part of mmO<sub>2</sub> following the demerger of [[O2 (United Kingdom)|BT Wireless]]'s operations from BT Group, and the company was owned by Telef\u00f3nica. On 4 June 2010 Manx Telecom was sold by Telef\u00f3nica to UK private equity investor [[HgCapital]] (who were buying the majority stake), alongside telecoms management company CPS Partners\n\nIn December 2007, the [[Manx Electricity Authority]] and its telecoms subsidiary, [[e-llan Communications]], commissioned the lighting of a new undersea fibre-optic link. It was laid in 1999 between Blackpool and Douglas as part of the [[Isle of Man to England Interconnector]] which connects the Manx electricity system to the UK's [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]].\n\nIn March 2009, [[BlueWave Communications]] installed microwave links to Ireland and the UK.

The domain is managed on a daily basis by Domicilium (IOM) Limited, an island based Internet service provider. Broadband Internet services are available through five local providers which are Manx Telecom, Sure, Wi-Manx, [[Domicilium]], and [[BlueWave Communications]].\n\n==Broadcasting==\n===Radio===\nThe public-service commercial [[radio]] station for the island is [[Manx Radio]]. Manx Radio is part funded by government grant, and partly by advertising. There are two other Manx-based FM radio stations, [[Energy FM (Isle of Man)|Energy FM]] and [[3 FM]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.three.fm/|title=3FM|work=3FM}}</ref>\n\nBBC national radio stations are also relayed locally via a transmitter located to the south of Douglas, relayed from [[Sandale transmitting station]] in Cumbria, as well as a signal feed from the [[Holme Moss transmitting station]] in [[West Yorkshire]]. The Douglas transmitter also broadcasts the BBC's DAB digital radio services and [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]].\n\nManx Radio is the only local service to broadcast on AM medium wave. No UK services are relayed via local AM transmitters. No [[longwave]] stations operate from the Island, although one ([[Musicmann279]]) was proposed. There are currently no proposals to broadcast any of the three insular FM stations on DAB.\n\n====Transmitters====\n* Snaefell - Manx Radio, Energy FM, 3FM\n* Foxdale - Manx Radio (AM)\n* Mull Hill (near Port St. Mary) - Energy FM, 3FM\n* Jurby - Energy FM, Manx Radio\n* Ramsey - Manx Radio, Energy FM, 3FM (a nearby site also used for television broadcasts the BBC DAB multiplex)\n* Ballasaig (Maughold) - Energy FM\n* Carnane (Douglas) - Manx Radio, Energy FM, 3FM, Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 3, Radio 4, Classic FM, BBC DAB multiplex\n* Port St Mary - 3FM, BBC DAB multiplex\n* Beary Peark - Energy FM, 3FM\n* Peel - Manx Radio\n* Cronk ny Arrey - 3FM\n\n===Television===\nThere is no Island-specific television service. Local transmitters retransmit UK Freeview broadcasts. The BBC region is [[BBC North West]] and the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] region is [[Granada Television|Granada]].\n\nMany TV services are available by satellite, such as [[Sky (UK & Ireland)|Sky]], and [[Freesat]] from the [[Astra 2/Eurobird 1]] group, as well as services from a range of other satellites around Europe such as [[Astra 1]] and [[Hot Bird]].\n\nManx [[ViaSat]]-IOM, [[ManSat]], [[Telesat]]-IOM companies uses the first communications satellite [[ViaSat-1]] that launched in 2011 and positioned at the Isle of Man registered 115.1 degrees West longitude [[geostationary orbit]] point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/13432-isle-man-launched-satellite-viasat.html|title=ViaSat-1 Launch Is Milestone for Isle of Man|work=Space.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=35059|title=The Isle of Man Government launch ViaSat-1 the first satellite to use an Isle of Man licensed orbital filing|work=spaceref.com}}</ref> In some areas, [[terrestrial television]] directly from the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Ireland]] can also be received.\n\nAnalogue television transmission ceased between 2008 and 2009, when limited local transmission of [[digital terrestrial television]] commenced. The UK's [[television licensing in the United Kingdom|television licence]] regime extends to the Island.\n\nThere is no Island-specific opt-out of the BBC regional news programme ''[[BBC North West Tonight|North West Tonight]]'', in the way that the [[Channel Islands]] get their own version of ''[[Spotlight (BBC South West News)|Spotlight]]''.\n\n[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] television has been available on parts of the east of the Isle of Man on 3 May 1956 when [[Granada Television]] transmissions started from the [[Winter Hill transmitting station]], and to parts of the west of the island on 1 October 1959 from the [[Black Mountain transmitting station]] in Northern Ireland which broadcast [[Ulster Television]]. Parts of the north of the island received [[Border Television]] since 1 September 1961, initially directly from the [[Caldbeck transmitting station]] in Cumberland. On 26 March 1965 Border Television commenced relay of their signal through a local transmitter on Richmond Hill, {{convert|542|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level and {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from the centre of Douglas. The site allowed reliable reception of the Caldbeck signal, which is rebroadcast on a different frequency. The {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} high transmission tower was re-sited from London, where it had been used for early ITV transmissions. Richmond Hill was decommissioned after the close of 405 line broadcasts, although the 200&nbsp;ft tower remained in use for radio with Manx Radio transmitting on 96.9&nbsp;MHz and then 97.3&nbsp;MHz until 1989. Manx Radio moved their FM service to the Carnane site and the frequency changed to the current 97.2&nbsp;MHz.\n\nThe television broadcasts are now transmitted from a {{convert|195|ft|m|abbr=on}} high transmitter on a hill to the south of Douglas. The transmitter is operated by [[Arqiva]] and is directly fed using a fibre optic cable. There are further sub-relay transmitters across the island. Following a realignment of ITV regional services and the digital switchover, the Douglas relay switched ITV broadcasts to Granada Television on Thursday 17 July 2009.\n\nThe Broadcasting Act 1993 (An Act of Tynwald)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epra.org/content/english/about/countries/BROADCASTING+ACT+1993_isle+of+Man.doc|title=Wayback Machine|date=7 February 2012|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207102239/http://www.epra.org/content/english/about/countries/BROADCASTING%20ACT%201993_isle%20of%20Man.doc|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=}}</ref> allows for the establishment of local television services.

Roads are numbered using a [[numbering scheme]] similar to the numbering schemes of [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|Great Britain]] and [[roads in Ireland|Northern Ireland]]; each road is assigned a letter, which represents the road's category, followed by a 1 or 2 digit number. ''A'' roads are the main roads of the island whilst roads labelled ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' or ''U'' decrease in size and/or quality. (The C, D and U numbers are not marked on most maps or on signposts.) There is no [[national speed limit]] - some roads may be driven at any speed which is safe and appropriate. Careless and [[dangerous driving]] laws still apply, so one may not drive at absolutely any speed, and there are local speed limits on many roads. Many unrestricted roads have frequent bends which even the most experienced driver cannot see round. Measured travel speeds (see table below) are often relatively low. Drivers are limited to {{convert|50|mph}} in the first two years after passing their driving test (Isle of Man citizens are permitted to start driving at the age of sixteen)<ref>{{cite web|title=Driving licences|url=http://www.gov.im/categories/travel-traffic-and-motoring/drivers-and-vehicles/driving-licences/|publisher=Isle of Man Government|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> and some are not used to having to make progress in the same way as on a larger road network such as that in the UK: even a cautious driver can get from anywhere in the island to anywhere else in ninety minutes).\n\nSet against this is a strong culture of motor sport enthusiasm (pinnacled in the [[Isle of Man TT|TT]], but there are many events during the year) and many residents familiar with the roads are well used to traversing country roads at speeds illegal on similar roads elsewhere. This leads to a very diverse spread of both driving competence and speed.

It was originally proposed by [[Claude E. Shannon]] in 1948 to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] and communication operations such as [[data compression]], in a landmark paper entitled \"[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]\". Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include [[lossless data compression]] (e.g. [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP files]]), [[lossy data compression]] (e.g. [[MP3]]s and [[JPEG]]s), and [[channel capacity|channel coding]] (e.g. for [[DSL|digital subscriber line (DSL)]]). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions to deep space, the invention of the [[compact disc]], the feasibility of [[mobile phone]]s, the development of the [[Internet]], the study of [[linguistics]] and of human perception, the understanding of [[black hole]]s, and numerous other fields.\n\nA key measure in information theory is \"[[information entropy|entropy]]\". Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a [[random variable]] or the outcome of a [[random process]]. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair [[coin flip]] (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a {{dice}} (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are [[mutual information]], [[channel capacity]], [[error exponent]]s, and [[relative entropy]].\n\nThe field is at the intersection of [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[neurobiology]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]]. The theory has also found applications in other areas, including [[statistical inference]], [[natural language processing]], [[cryptography]], [[neurobiology]],<ref name=\"Spikes\">{{cite book|title=Spikes: Exploring the Neural Code|publisher=The MIT press|year=1997|isbn=978-0262681087|author1=F.

Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty. In the case of communication of information over a noisy channel, this abstract concept was made concrete in 1948 by [[Claude Shannon]] in his paper \"[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]\", in which \"information\" is thought of as a set of possible messages, where the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and then to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite of the channel noise. Shannon's main result, the [[noisy-channel coding theorem]] showed that, in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the [[channel capacity]], a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent.<ref name=\"Spikes\" />\n\nInformation theory is closely associated with a collection of pure and applied disciplines that have been investigated and reduced to engineering practice under a variety of [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]] throughout the world over the past half century or more: [[adaptive system]]s, [[anticipatory system]]s, [[artificial intelligence]], [[complex system]]s, [[complexity science]], [[cybernetics]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[machine learning]], along with [[systems science]]s of many descriptions. Information theory is a broad and deep mathematical theory, with equally broad and deep applications, amongst which is the vital field of [[coding theory]].\n\nCoding theory is concerned with finding explicit methods, called ''codes'', for increasing the efficiency and reducing the error rate of data communication over noisy channels to near the [[channel capacity]]. These codes can be roughly subdivided into [[data compression]] (source coding) and [[error-correction]] (channel coding) techniques. In the latter case, it took many years to find the methods Shannon's work proved were possible. A third class of information theory codes are cryptographic algorithms (both [[code (cryptography)|code]]s and [[cipher]]s). Concepts, methods and results from coding theory and information theory are widely used in [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]]. ''See the article [[ban (unit)]] for a historical application.''\n\nInformation theory is also used in [[information retrieval]], [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence gathering]], [[gambling]], [[statistics]], and even in [[musical composition]].\n\n==Historical background==\n{{Main|History of information theory}}\n\nThe landmark event that ''established'' the discipline of information theory and brought it to immediate worldwide attention was the publication of [[Claude E. Shannon]]'s classic paper \"[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]\" in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'' in July and October 1948.\n\nPrior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at [[Bell Labs]], all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.  [[Harry Nyquist]]'s 1924 paper, ''Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed'', contains a theoretical section quantifying \"intelligence\" and the \"line speed\" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system, giving the relation {{math|1=''W'' = ''K'' log ''m''}} (recalling [[Boltzmann's constant]]), where ''W'' is the speed of transmission of intelligence, ''m'' is the number of different voltage levels to choose from at each time step, and ''K'' is a constant.  [[Ralph Hartley]]'s 1928 paper, ''Transmission of Information'', uses the word ''information'' as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one [[sequence of symbols]] from any other, thus quantifying information as {{math|1=''H'' = log ''S''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''n'' log ''S''}}, where ''S'' was the number of possible symbols, and ''n'' the number of symbols in a transmission. The unit of information was therefore the [[decimal digit]], which has since sometimes been called the [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]] in his honor as a unit or scale or measure of information. [[Alan Turing]] in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] ciphers.\n\nMuch of the mathematics behind information theory with events of different probabilities were developed for the field of [[thermodynamics]] by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and [[J. Willard Gibbs]].  Connections between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy, including the important contributions by [[Rolf Landauer]] in the 1960s, are explored in ''[[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory]]''.\n\nIn Shannon's revolutionary and groundbreaking paper, the work for which had been substantially completed at Bell Labs by the end of 1944, Shannon for the first time introduced the qualitative and quantitative model of communication as a statistical process underlying information theory, opening with the assertion that\n:\"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point.\"\n\nWith it came the ideas of\n* the [[information entropy]] and [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] of a source, and its relevance through the [[source coding theorem]];\n* the [[mutual information]], and the [[channel capacity]] of a noisy channel, including the promise of perfect loss-free communication given by the [[noisy-channel coding theorem]];\n* the practical result of the [[Shannon\u2013Hartley law]] for the channel capacity of a [[Gaussian channel]]; as well as\n* the [[bit]]\u2014a new way of seeing the most fundamental unit of information.\n\n==Quantities of information==\n{{Main|Quantities of information}}\n\nInformation theory is based on [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]].  Information theory often concerns itself with measures of information of the distributions associated with random variables. Important quantities of information are [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]], a measure of information in a single [[random variable]], and [[mutual information]], a measure of information in common between two random variables.  The former quantity is a property of the probability distribution of a random variable and gives a limit on the rate at which data generated by independent samples with the given distribution can be reliably [[data compression|compressed]]. The latter is a property of the joint distribution of two random variables, and is the maximum rate of reliable communication across a noisy [[Communication channel|channel]] in the limit of long block lengths, when the channel statistics are determined by the joint distribution.\n\nThe choice of logarithmic base in the following formulae determines the [[units of measurement|unit]] of [[information entropy]] that is used.  A common unit of information is the [[bit]], based on the [[binary logarithm]]. Other units include the [[nat (unit)|nat]], which is based on the [[natural logarithm]], and the [[deciban|decimal digit]], which is based on the [[common logarithm]].\n\nIn what follows, an expression of the form {{math|''p'' log ''p''}} is considered by convention to be equal to zero whenever {{math|1=''p'' = 0}}.  This is justified because <math>\\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0+} p \\log p = 0</math> for any logarithmic base.\n\n===Entropy of an information source===\nBased on the [[probability mass function]] of each source symbol to be communicated, the Shannon [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] {{math|''H''}}, in units of bits (per symbol), is given by\n:<math>H = - \\sum_{i} p_i \\log_2 (p_i)</math>\nwhere {{math|''p<sub>i</sub>''}} is the probability of occurrence of the {{math|''i''}}-th possible value of the source symbol. This equation gives the entropy in the units of \"bits\" (per symbol) because it uses a logarithm of base 2, and this base-2 measure of entropy has sometimes been called the \"[[Shannon (unit)|shannon]]\" in his honor. Entropy is also commonly computed using the [[natural logarithm]] (base [[E (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]], where {{mvar|e}} is [[Euler's number]]), which produces a measurement of entropy in \"[[nat (unit)|nats]]\" per symbol and sometimes simplifies the analysis by avoiding the need to include extra constants in the formulas. Other bases are also possible, but less commonly used. For example, a logarithm of base {{nowrap|1=2<sup>8</sup> = 256}} will produce a measurement in [[byte]]s per symbol, and a logarithm of base 10 will produce a measurement in decimal digits (or hartleys) per symbol.\n\nIntuitively, the entropy {{math|''H<sub>X</sub>''}} of a discrete random variable {{math|''X''}} is a measure of the amount of ''uncertainty'' associated with the value of {{math|''X''}} when only its distribution is known.\n\nThe entropy of a source that emits a sequence of {{math|''N''}} symbols that are [[independent and identically distributed]] (iid) is {{math|''N&middot;H''}} bits (per message of {{math|''N''}} symbols). If the source data symbols are identically distributed but not independent, the entropy of a message of length {{math|''N''}} will be less than {{math|''N''\u00b7''H''}}.\n\n[[File:Binary entropy plot.svg|thumbnail|right|200px|The entropy of a [[Bernoulli trial]] as a function of success probability, often called the ''[[binary entropy function]]'', {{math|''H''<sub>b</sub>(''p'')}}.  The entropy is maximized at 1 bit per trial when the two possible outcomes are equally probable, as in an unbiased coin toss.]]\n\nIf one transmits 1000 bits (0s and 1s), and the value of each of these bits is known to the receiver (has a specific value with certainty) ahead of transmission, it is clear that no information is transmitted.  If, however, each bit is independently equally likely to be 0 or 1, 1000 shannons of information (more often called bits) have been transmitted.  Between these two extremes, information can be quantified as follows. If  \t\ud835\udd4f is the set of all messages {{math|{{mset|''x''<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}}}} that {{math|''X''}} could be, and {{math|''p''(''x'')}} is the probability of some <math>x \\in \\mathbb X</math>, then the entropy, {{math|''H''}}, of {{math|''X''}} is defined:<ref name = Reza>{{cite book | title = An Introduction to Information Theory | author = Fazlollah M. Reza | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc., New York | origyear = 1961| year = 1994 | isbn = 0-486-68210-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RtzpRAiX6OgC&pg=PA8&dq=intitle:%22An+Introduction+to+Information+Theory%22++%22entropy+of+a+simple+source%22}}</ref>\n\n:<math> H(X) = \\mathbb{E}_{X} [I(x)] = -\\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{X}} p(x) \\log p(x).</math>\n\n(Here, {{math|''I''(''x'')}} is the [[self-information]], which is the entropy contribution of an individual message, and {{math|\ud835\udd3c<sub>''X''</sub>}} is the [[expected value]].) A property of entropy is that it is maximized when all the messages in the message space are equiprobable {{math|1=''p''(''x'') = 1/''n''}}; i.e., most unpredictable, in which case {{math|1=''H''(''X'') = log ''n''}}.\n\nThe special case of information entropy for a random variable with two outcomes is the ''[[binary entropy function]]'', usually taken to the logarithmic base 2, thus having the shannon (Sh) as unit:\n\n:<math>H_{\\mathrm{b}}(p) = - p \\log_2 p - (1-p)\\log_2 (1-p).</math>\n\n===Joint entropy===\nThe ''[[joint entropy]]'' of two discrete random variables {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} is merely the entropy of their pairing: {{math|(''X'', ''Y'')}}.  This implies that if {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are [[statistical independence|independent]], then their joint entropy is the sum of their individual entropies.\n\nFor example, if {{math|(''X'', ''Y'')}} represents the position of a [[chess]] piece \u2014 {{math|''X''}} the row and {{math|''Y''}} the column, then the joint entropy of the row of the piece and the column of the piece will be the entropy of the position of the piece.\n\n:<math>H(X, Y) = \\mathbb{E}_{X,Y} [-\\log p(x,y)] = - \\sum_{x, y} p(x, y) \\log p(x, y) \\,</math>\n\nDespite similar notation, joint entropy should not be confused with ''[[cross entropy]]''.\n\n===Conditional entropy (equivocation)===\nThe ''[[conditional entropy]]'' or ''conditional uncertainty'' of {{math|''X''}} given random variable {{math|''Y''}} (also called the ''equivocation'' of {{math|''X''}} about {{math|''Y''}}) is the average conditional entropy over {{math|''Y''}}:<ref name=Ash>{{cite book | title = Information Theory | author = Robert B. Ash | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc. | origyear = 1965| year = 1990 | isbn = 0-486-66521-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ngZhvUfF0UIC&pg=PA16&dq=intitle:information+intitle:theory+inauthor:ash+conditional+uncertainty}}</ref>\n\n:<math> H(X|Y) = \\mathbb E_Y [H(X|y)] = -\\sum_{y \\in Y} p(y) \\sum_{x \\in X} p(x|y) \\log p(x|y) = -\\sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \\log p(x|y).</math>\n\nBecause entropy can be conditioned on a random variable or on that random variable being a certain value, care should be taken not to confuse these two definitions of conditional entropy, the former of which is in more common use.  A basic property of this form of conditional entropy is that:\n\n: <math> H(X|Y) = H(X,Y) - H(Y) .\\,</math>\n\n===Mutual information (transinformation)===\n''[[Mutual information]]'' measures the amount of information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing another.  It is important in communication where it can be used to maximize the amount of information shared between sent and received signals.  The mutual information of {{math|''X''}} relative to {{math|''Y''}} is given by:\n\n:<math>I(X;Y) = \\mathbb{E}_{X,Y} [SI(x,y)] = \\sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \\log \\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)\\, p(y)}</math>\nwhere {{math|SI}} (''S''pecific mutual ''I''nformation) is the [[pointwise mutual information]].\n\nA basic property of the mutual information is that\n: <math>I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y).\\,</math>\nThat is, knowing ''Y'', we can save an average of {{math|''I''(''X''; ''Y'')}} bits in encoding ''X'' compared to not knowing ''Y''.\n\nMutual information is [[symmetric function|symmetric]]:\n: <math>I(X;Y) = I(Y;X) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y).\\,</math>\n\nMutual information can be expressed as the average [[Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence]] (information gain) between the [[posterior probability|posterior probability distribution]] of ''X'' given the value of ''Y'' and the [[prior probability|prior distribution]] on ''X'':\n: <math>I(X;Y) = \\mathbb E_{p(y)} [D_{\\mathrm{KL}}( p(X|Y=y) \\| p(X) )].</math>\nIn other words, this is a measure of how much, on the average, the probability distribution on ''X'' will change if we are given the value of ''Y''.  This is often recalculated as the divergence from the product of the marginal distributions to the actual joint distribution:\n: <math>I(X; Y) = D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p(X,Y) \\| p(X)p(Y)).</math>\n\nMutual information is closely related to the [[likelihood-ratio test|log-likelihood ratio test]] in the context of contingency tables and the [[multinomial distribution]] and to [[Pearson's chi-squared test|Pearson's \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test]]: mutual information can be considered a statistic for assessing independence between a pair of variables, and has a well-specified asymptotic distribution.\n\n===Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence (information gain)===\nThe ''[[Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence]]'' (or ''information divergence'', ''information gain'', or ''relative entropy'') is a way of comparing two distributions: a \"true\" [[probability distribution]] ''p(X)'', and an arbitrary probability distribution ''q(X)''. If we compress data in a manner that assumes ''q(X)'' is the distribution underlying some data, when, in reality, ''p(X)'' is the correct distribution, the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence is the number of average additional bits per datum necessary for compression.  It is thus defined\n\n:<math>D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p(X) \\| q(X)) = \\sum_{x \\in X} -p(x) \\log {q(x)} \\, - \\, \\sum_{x \\in X} -p(x) \\log {p(x)} = \\sum_{x \\in X} p(x) \\log \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}.</math>\n\nAlthough it is sometimes used as a 'distance metric', KL divergence is not a true [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] since it is not symmetric and does not satisfy the [[triangle inequality]] (making it a semi-quasimetric).\n\nAnother interpretation of the KL divergence is the \"unnecessary surprise\" introduced by a prior from the truth: suppose a number ''X'' is about to be drawn randomly from a discrete set with probability distribution ''p(x)''.  If Alice knows the true distribution ''p(x)'', while Bob believes (has a [[prior probability|prior]]) that the distribution is ''q(x)'', then Bob will be more [[Self-information|surprised]] than Alice, on average, upon seeing the value of ''X''.  The KL divergence is the (objective) expected value of Bob's (subjective) [[surprisal]] minus Alice's surprisal, measured in bits if the ''log'' is in base 2.  In this way, the extent to which Bob's prior is \"wrong\" can be quantified in terms of how \"unnecessarily surprised\" it is expected to make him.\n\n===Other quantities===\nOther important information theoretic quantities include [[R\u00e9nyi entropy]] (a generalization of entropy), [[differential entropy]] (a generalization of quantities of information to continuous distributions), and the [[conditional mutual information]].\n\n==Coding theory==\n{{Main|Coding theory}}\n\n[[File:CDSCRATCHES.jpg|thumb|right|A picture showing scratches on the readable surface of a CD-R.  Music and data CDs are coded using error correcting codes and thus can still be read even if they have minor scratches using [[error detection and correction]].]]\n\n[[Coding theory]] is one of the most important and direct applications of information theory. It can be subdivided into [[data compression|source coding]] theory and [[error correction|channel coding]] theory. Using a statistical description for data, information theory quantifies the number of bits needed to describe the data, which is the information entropy of the source.\n\n* Data compression (source coding): There are two formulations for the compression problem:\n*[[lossless data compression]]: the data must be reconstructed exactly;\n*[[lossy data compression]]: allocates bits needed to reconstruct the data, within a specified fidelity level measured by a distortion function. This subset of information theory is called ''[[rate\u2013distortion theory]]''.\n* Error-correcting codes (channel coding): While data compression removes as much [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] as possible, an error correcting code adds just the right kind of redundancy (i.e., [[error correction]]) needed to transmit the data efficiently and faithfully across a noisy channel.\n\nThis division of coding theory into compression and transmission is justified by the information transmission theorems, or source\u2013channel separation theorems that justify the use of bits as the universal currency for information in many contexts. However, these theorems only hold in the situation where one transmitting user wishes to communicate to one receiving user. In scenarios with more than one transmitter (the multiple-access channel), more than one receiver (the [[broadcast channel]]) or intermediary \"helpers\" (the [[relay channel]]), or more general [[computer network|networks]], compression followed by transmission may no longer be optimal. [[Network information theory]] refers to these multi-agent communication models.\n\n===Source theory===\nAny process that generates successive messages can be considered a ''[[Communication source|source]]'' of information.  A memoryless source is one in which each message is an [[Independent identically distributed random variables|independent identically distributed random variable]], whereas the properties of [[ergodic theory|ergodicity]] and [[stationary process|stationarity]] impose less restrictive constraints.  All such sources are [[stochastic process|stochastic]].  These terms are well studied in their own right outside information theory.\n\n====Rate====<!-- This section is linked from [[Channel capacity]] -->\nInformation ''[[Entropy rate|rate]]'' is the average entropy per symbol.  For memoryless sources, this is merely the entropy of each symbol, while, in the case of a stationary stochastic process, it is\n\n:<math>r = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} H(X_n|X_{n-1},X_{n-2},X_{n-3}, \\ldots);</math>\n\nthat is, the conditional entropy of a symbol given all the previous symbols generated.  For the more general case of a process that is not necessarily stationary, the ''average rate'' is\n\n:<math>r = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} H(X_1, X_2, \\dots X_n);</math>\n\nthat is, the limit of the joint entropy per symbol.  For stationary sources, these two expressions give the same result.<ref>{{cite book | title = Digital Compression for Multimedia: Principles and Standards | author = Jerry D. Gibson | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | year = 1998 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aqQ2Ry6spu0C&pg=PA56&dq=entropy-rate+conditional#PPA57,M1 | isbn = 1-55860-369-7 }}</ref>\n\nIt is common in information theory to speak of the \"rate\" or \"entropy\" of a language.  This is appropriate, for example, when the source of information is English prose.  The rate of a source of information is related to its [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] and how well it can be [[data compression|compressed]], the subject of ''source coding''.\n\n===Channel capacity===\n{{Main|Channel capacity}}\n\nCommunications over a channel\u2014such as an [[ethernet]] [[Electrical cable|cable]]\u2014is the primary motivation of information theory.  As anyone who's ever used a telephone (mobile or landline) knows, however, such channels often fail to produce exact reconstruction of a signal; noise, periods of silence, and other forms of signal corruption often degrade quality.\n\nConsider the communications process over a discrete channel. A simple model of the process is shown below:\n\n[[File:Comm Channel.svg|center|500px]]\n\nHere ''X'' represents the space of messages transmitted, and ''Y'' the space of messages received during a unit time over our channel. Let {{math|''p''(''y''{{pipe}}''x'')}} be the [[conditional probability]] distribution function of ''Y'' given ''X''. We will consider {{math|''p''(''y''{{pipe}}''x'')}} to be an inherent fixed property of our communications channel (representing the nature of the ''[[Signal noise|noise]]'' of our channel). Then the joint distribution of ''X'' and ''Y'' is completely determined by our channel and by our choice of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, the marginal distribution of messages we choose to send over the channel. Under these constraints, we would like to maximize the rate of information, or the ''[[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]'', we can communicate over the channel. The appropriate measure for this is the [[mutual information]], and this maximum mutual information is called the ''[[channel capacity]]'' and is given by:\n:<math> C = \\max_{f} I(X;Y).\\! </math>\nThis capacity has the following property related to communicating at information rate ''R'' (where ''R'' is usually bits per symbol).  For any information rate ''R < C'' and coding error \u03b5 > 0, for large enough ''N'', there exists a code of length ''N'' and rate \u2265 R and a decoding algorithm, such that the maximal probability of block error is \u2264 \u03b5; that is, it is always possible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error.  In addition, for any rate ''R &gt; C'', it is impossible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error.\n\n''[[Channel code|Channel coding]]'' is concerned with finding such nearly optimal [[error detection and correction|codes]] that can be used to transmit data over a noisy channel with a small coding error at a rate near the channel capacity.\n\n====Capacity of particular channel models====\n* A continuous-time analog communications channel subject to [[Gaussian noise]] \u2014 see [[Shannon\u2013Hartley theorem]].\n* A [[binary symmetric channel]] (BSC) with crossover probability ''p'' is a binary input, binary output channel that flips the input bit with probability ''p''. The BSC has a capacity of {{math|1 &minus; ''H''<sub>b</sub>(''p'')}} bits per channel use, where {{math|''H''<sub>b</sub>}} is the [[binary entropy function]] to the base-2 logarithm:\n\n::[[File:Binary symmetric channel.svg]]\n\n* A [[binary erasure channel]] (BEC) with erasure probability ''p'' is a binary input, ternary output channel. The possible channel outputs are 0, 1, and a third symbol 'e' called an erasure. The erasure represents complete loss of information about an input bit. The capacity of the BEC is {{nowrap|1 &minus; ''p''}} bits per channel use.\n\n::[[File:Binary erasure channel.svg]]\n\n==Applications to other fields==\n\n===Intelligence uses and secrecy applications===\nInformation theoretic concepts apply to [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]].  [[Turing]]'s information unit, the [[Ban (unit)|ban]], was used in the [[Ultra]] project, breaking the German [[Enigma machine]] code and hastening the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of World War II in Europe]].  Shannon himself defined an important concept now called the [[unicity distance]]. Based on the [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] of the [[plaintext]], it attempts to give a minimum amount of [[ciphertext]] necessary to ensure unique decipherability.\n\nInformation theory leads us to believe it is much more difficult to keep secrets than it might first appear.  A [[brute force attack]] can break systems based on [[public-key cryptography|asymmetric key algorithms]] or on most commonly used methods of [[symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key algorithms]] (sometimes called secret key algorithms), such as [[block cipher]]s.  The security of all such methods currently comes from the assumption that no known attack can break them in a practical amount of time.\n\n[[Information theoretic security]] refers to methods such as the [[one-time pad]] that are not vulnerable to such brute force attacks.  In such cases, the positive conditional [[mutual information]] between the [[plaintext]] and [[ciphertext]] (conditioned on the [[key (cryptography)|key]]) can ensure proper transmission, while the unconditional mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext remains zero, resulting in absolutely secure communications.  In other words, an eavesdropper would not be able to improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key. However, as in any other cryptographic system, care must be used to correctly apply even information-theoretically secure methods; the [[Venona project]] was able to crack the one-time pads of the Soviet Union due to their improper reuse of key material.\n\n===Pseudorandom number generation===\n[[Pseudorandom number generator]]s are widely available in computer language libraries and application programs. They are, almost universally, unsuited to cryptographic use as they do not evade the deterministic nature of modern computer equipment and software. A class of improved random number generators is termed [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]s, but even they require [[random seed]]s external to the software to work as intended. These can be obtained via [[Extractor (mathematics)|extractors]], if done carefully. The measure of  sufficient randomness in extractors is [[min-entropy]], a value related to Shannon entropy through [[R\u00e9nyi entropy]]; R\u00e9nyi entropy is also used in evaluating randomness in cryptographic systems.  Although related, the distinctions among these measures mean that a [[random variable]] with high Shannon entropy is not necessarily satisfactory for use in an extractor and so for cryptography uses.\n\n===Seismic exploration===\nOne early commercial application of information theory was in the field of seismic oil exploration. Work in this field made it possible to strip off and separate the unwanted noise from the desired seismic signal.

An introduction to qualitative research synthesis: Managing the information explosion in social science research.

This is equivalent to less than one 730-MB [[CD-ROM]] per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), roughly 4 [[CD-ROM]] per person of 1993, 12 [[CD-ROM]] per person in the year 2000, and almost 61 [[CD-ROM]] per person in 2007. Piling up the imagined 404 billion [[CD-ROM]] from 2007 would create a stack from the [[Earth]] to the [[Moon]] and a quarter of this distance beyond (with 1.2&nbsp;mm thickness per CD).<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\">[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 \"The Womartinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html \"free access to the study\"] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo \"video animation\"].</ref>\n* The world\u2019s technological capacity to receive information through one-way [[broadcast]] networks was 432 exabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 715 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1993, 1,200 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, and 1,900 in 2007.<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\"/>\n* The world's effective capacity to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunication]] networks was 0.281 exabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 0.471 in 1993, 2.2 in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007.<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\"/>\n\nA new metric that is being used in an attempt to characterize the growth in person-specific information, is the disk storage per person (DSP), which is measured in megabytes/person (where [[megabytes]] is 10<sup>6</sup> [[bytes]] and is abbreviated MB). Global DSP (GDSP) is the total rigid disk drive space (in MB) of new units sold in a year divided by the [[world population]] in that year. The GDSP metric is a crude measure of how much disk storage could possibly be used to collect person-specific data on the world population.<ref name=\"Sweeney, Latanya 2001\"/> \nIn 1983, one million fixed drives with an estimated total of 90 [[terabytes]] were sold worldwide; 30MB drives had the largest market segment.<ref>Disk/Trend report 1983,\u201d Computer Week. Mountain View, CA.

Expansion of the number of fields being collected, known as the \u201ccollect more\u201d trend.\n\n'''Type 2.''' Replace an existing aggregate data collection with a person-specific one, known as the \u201ccollect specifically\u201d trend.\n\n'''Type 3.''' Gather information by starting a new person-specific data collection, known as the \u201ccollect it if you can\u201d trend.<ref name=\"Sweeney, Latanya 2001\"/>\n\n==Related terms==\nSince \"information\" in electronic media is often used synonymously with \"data\", the term ''information explosion'' is closely related to the concept of ''data flood'' (also dubbed ''data deluge''). Sometimes the term ''information flood'' is used as well. All of those basically boil down to the ever-increasing amount of [[Digital data|electronic data]] exchanged per time unit. The awareness about non-manageable amounts of data grew along with the advent of ever more powerful data processing since the mid-1960s.<ref>[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=data+flood%2Cdata+deluge%2Cinformation+flood&year_start=1955&year_end=2010&corpus=0&smoothing=2 Google Books Ngram viewer] for the terms mentioned here</ref>\n\n==Challenges==\nEven though the abundance of information can be beneficial in several levels, some problems may be of concern such as [[privacy]], legal and ethical guidelines, filtering and data accuracy.<ref name=\"Berner, Eta S. 2005\">Berner, Eta S., and Jacqueline Moss. \"Informatics challenges for the impending patient information explosion.\" Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 12.6 (2005): 614-617.</ref> Filtering refers to finding useful information in the middle of so much data, which relates to the job of data scientists. A typical example of a necessity of data filtering ([[data mining]]) is in healthcare since in the next years is due to have EHRs ([[Electronic Health Records]]) of patients available. With so much information available, the doctors will need to be able to identify patterns and select important data for the diagnosis of the patient.<ref name=\"Berner, Eta S. 2005\"/> On the other hand, according to some experts, having so much public data available makes it difficult to provide data that is actually anonymous.<ref name=\"Sweeney, Latanya 2001\"/>\nAnother point to take into account is the legal and ethical guidelines, which relates to who will be the owner of the data and how frequently he/she is obliged to the release this and for how long.<ref name=\"Berner, Eta S. 2005\"/>\nWith so many sources of data, another problem will be accuracy of such. An untrusted source may be challenged by others, by ordering a new set of data, causing a repetition in the information.<ref name=\"Berner, Eta S. 2005\"/>\nAccording to Edward Huth, another concern is the accessibility and cost of such information.<ref>Huth, Edward J. \"The information explosion.\" Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine 65.6 (1989): 647.</ref> The accessibility rate could be improved by either reducing the costs or increasing the utility of the information. The reduction of costs according to the author, could be done by associations, which should assess which information was relevant and gather it in a more organized fashion.\n\n==Web servers==\n\nAs of August 2005, there were over 70 million [[web server]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline 10.1|url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/|publisher=zakon.org|accessdate=27 August 2011|author=Robert H Zakon|date=15 December 2010}}</ref> {{As of|2007|09}} there were over 135 million web servers.<ref>{{cite web|title=August 2011 Web Server Survey|url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html|publisher=netcraft.com|accessdate=27 August 2011|date=August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Blogs==\nAccording to [[Technorati]], the number of [[blogs]] doubles about every 6 months with a total of 35.3 million blogs {{As of|2006|04|lc=y|url=http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000432.html}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=State of the Blogosphere, April 2006 Part 1: On Blogosphere Growth|url=http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000432.html|publisher=Sifry's Alerts (sifry.com)|accessdate=27 August 2011|date=April 17, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CIPK8Vks?url=http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000432.html|archivedate=19 November 2012|df=}}</ref> This is an example of the early stages of [[logistic growth]], where growth is approximately [[Exponential growth|exponential]], since blogs are a recent innovation.

They are typically located in the country or along a highway; before the advent of motorized transportation they also provided accommodation for horses.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Tabard inn mid19th.jpg|right|thumb|The Tabard Inn, Southwark, London, around 1850]]\n[[File:Sultanhani - Fassade.jpg|thumb|Facade of the Sultanhani caravanserai in Turkey]]\n[[File:\u0632\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of Zein-o-din caravanserai near [[Yazd]], [[Iran]], one of a few circular caravanserai.]]\nInns in Europe were possibly first established when the Romans built their system of [[Roman road]]s two millennia ago. Some inns in Europe are several centuries old. In addition to providing for the needs of travelers, inns traditionally acted as community gathering places.\n\nHistorically, inns in Europe provided not only food and lodging, but also stabling and [[fodder]] for the travelers' horses. Famous London examples of inns include the [[The George Inn, Southwark|George]] and the [[The Tabard|Tabard]]. There is however no longer a formal distinction between an inn and other kinds of establishment. Many [[pub]]s use the name \"inn\", either because they are long established and may have been formerly [[coaching inn]]s, or to summon up a particular kind of image.\n\nInns were like [[bed and breakfast]]s, with a community dining room which was also used for town meetings or rented for wedding parties. The front, facing the road was ornamental and welcoming for travelers. The back also usually had at least one livery barn for travelers to keep their horses. There were not lobbies as in modern inns; but the innkeeper would answer the door for each visitor and judge the people whom he decided to allow to come in. Many inns were simply large estates that had extra rooms for renting.\n\nDuring the 19th century the inn played a major role in the growing transportation system of England. Industry was on the rise and people were traveling more in order to keep and maintain business. The English Inn was considered an important part of English infrastructure as it helped maintain a smooth flow of travel throughout the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chartres|first1=John|title=The Eighteenth-Century English Inn: A Transient \"Golden Age\"?|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=0-7546-0341-5|page=211}}</ref>\n\nAs modes of transport have evolved, tourist lodging has adapted to serve each generation of traveller. A [[stagecoach]] made frequent stops at roadside coaching inns for water, food and horses. A passenger train stops only at designated stations in the city centre, around which were built [[hotel#railway hotels|grand railway hotels]]. Motorcar traffic on old-style two-lane highways may pause at any camp, cabin court or [[motel]] along the way, while freeway traffic is restricted to access from designated off-ramps to side roads which quickly become crowded with [[hotel chain]] operators.\n\nThe original functions of an inn are now usually split among separate establishments, such as hotels, [[lodging|lodge]]s, and [[motel]]s, all of which might provide the traditional functions of an inn but which focus more on lodging customers than on other services; [[public house]]s, which are primarily alcohol-serving establishments; and restaurants and [[tavern]]s, which serve food and drink. (Hotels often contain restaurants serving full breakfasts and meals, thus providing all of the functions of traditional inns. [[Economy limited service|Economy, limited service]] properties, however, claim at most an included [[continental breakfast]] as there is no kitchen and no bar.)\n\nThe lodging aspect of the word ''inn'' lives on in hotel brand names like [[Holiday Inn]], and in some laws that refer to lodging operators as ''innkeepers''.  The [[Inns of Court]] in London were once accommodations for members of the legal profession.\n\n== Forms ==\nOther forms of inn exist throughout the world.  Among them are the [[honjin]] and [[ryokan (inn)|ryokan]] of [[Japan]], [[caravanserai]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and Jiuguan in ancient China.\n\nIn [[Asia Minor]], during the periods of rule by the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuq]] and [[Ottoman Turks]], impressive structures functioning as inns ({{lang-tr|[[:tr:Han (konaklama)|han]]}}) were built because it was thought that inns were socially significant. These inns provided accommodation for people and their vehicles or animals and served as a resting place for people, whether travelling on foot or by other means.\n\nThese inns were built between towns if the distance between them was too far for one day's travel. These structures were called [[Caravanserai|caravansarais]] which were inns with large courtyards with ample supplies of water for both drinking and other uses. They would also routinely contain a caf\u00e9 in addition to supplies of food and fodder. After the [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]]s traveled a while they would take a break at these caravansarais, and spend the night there to rest both themselves and their animals.\n\n==Usage of the term==\nThe term \"inn\" historically characterized a rural hotel which provided lodging, food and refreshments, and accommodations for travelers' horses. To capitalize on this nostalgic image many typically lower end and middling modern motor hotel operators seek to distance themselves from similar [[motel]]s by styling themselves \"inns\", regardless of services and accommodations provided.  Examples are [[Premier Inn]], Holiday Inn, [[Comfort Inn]], [[Days Inn]] and [[Knights Inn]].\n\nThe term inn is also retained in its historic use in many laws governing motels and hotels, often known as \"innkeeper's acts\",<ref>Innkeepers Act, RSA 2000, c I-2, Consolidated Statutes of Alberta; Innkeepers Act, RSNL 1990, c I-7, Consolidated Statutes of Newfoundland and Labrador; Innkeepers Act, RSO 1990, c I.7\t\nConsolidated Statutes of Ontario</ref> or refer to h\u00f4teliers and motel operators as \"innkeepers\" in the body of the legislation<ref>Hotel Keepers Act, RSBC 1996, c 206, Consolidated Statutes of British Columbia</ref><ref>Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec, LRQ, c C-1991, Division III: Deposit with an Innkeeper</ref> These laws typically define the innkeepers' liability for valuables entrusted to them by clients and determine whether an innkeeper holds any lien against such goods. In some jurisdictions, an offence named as \"[[dine and dash|defrauding an innkeeper]]\" prohibits fraudulently obtaining \"food, lodging, or other accommodation at any hotel, inn, boarding house, or eating house\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-43/chapter-21/article-1/43-21-13/ |title=\u00a7 43-21-13 - Defrauding innkeeper :: 2010 Georgia Code :: US Codes and Statutes :: US Law :: Justia |publisher=Law.justia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-13}}</ref> in this context, the term is often an anachronism as the majority of modern restaurants are free-standing and not attached to coaching inns or tourist lodging.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallery\n|File:Cott inn.jpg |The Cott Inn at Cott, Dartington, Devon, UK dates from 1320\n|File:\u00d6sterv\u00e5la 133.JPG|[[\u00d6sterv\u00e5la]] Inn, Sweden, interior \n|File:Sheep's Heid Inn.jpg|Sheep's Heid Inn, Edinburgh, interior\n|File:Yelverton Inn.jpg |[[Yelverton Inn and Store|Yelverton Inn]], in [[Chester (village), New York|Chester]], New York\n|File:Albanian Inn.JPG |Albanian Inn, interior\n|File:Garrick Inn (8061945280).jpg |The Garrick Inn, Stratford-upon-Avon, is a timber framed building dating back to the 15th century.\n|File:Angel Inn, Highgate, N6.jpg |Angel Inn, Highgate, north London\n|File:Thunder Bay Inn.jpg |The Thunder Bay Inn in Big Bay, Michigan, U.S\n|File:The Exeter Inn.jpg|The [[Exeter Inn]], [[Exeter, New Hampshire]]\n|File:Vila Capivari, Campos do Jord\u00e3o.JPG|The Villa D'Biagy Inn in [[Campos do Jord\u00e3o]], Brazil\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Bed and breakfast]]\n*[[Hostler]], a groom who takes care of a traveler's horse\n*[[Youth hostel]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n*Burke, Thomas (1927) ''The Book of the Inn: being two hundred pictures of the English inn from the earliest times to the coming of the railway hotel''; selected and edited by Thomas Burke.

It is the second largest olympiad, after [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], in terms of number of participating countries (83 at IOI 2017). The first IOI was held in 1989 in [[Pravetz]], Bulgaria.\n\nThe contest consists of two days of computer programming and problem-solving of [[algorithm]]ic nature. To deal with problems involving very large amounts of data, it is necessary to have not only programmers, \"but also creative coders, who can dream up what it is that the programmers need to tell the computer to do.

Students in the national teams are selected through national computing contests, such as the [[Australian Informatics Olympiad]], [[British Informatics Olympiad]], [[Indian Computing Olympiad]] or Bundeswettbewerb Informatik (Germany).\n\nThe International Olympiad in Informatics is one of the most prestigious computer science competitions in the world. [[UNESCO]] and [[IFIP]] are patrons.\n\n== Competition structure and participation ==\n[[File:IOI2009 Banner.JPG|thumb|right|IOI 2009's banner above the competition room]]\nOn each of the two competition days, the students are typically given three problems which they have to solve in five hours. Each student works on his/her own, with only a computer and no other help allowed, specifically no communication with other contestants, books etc. Usually to solve a task the contestant has to write a computer program (in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], or [[Java (programming language)|Java]]<ref>http://ioi2015.kz/content/view/1/264</ref>) and submit it before the five-hour competition time ends. The program is graded by being run with secret test data. From IOI 2010, tasks are divided into subtasks with graduated difficulty, and points are awarded only when all tests for a particular subtask yield correct results, within specific time and memory limits. In some cases, the contestant's program has to interact with a secret computer library, which allows problems where the input is not fixed, but depends on the program's actions \u2013 for example in game problems. Another type of problem has known inputs which are publicly available already during the five hours of the contest. For these, the contestants have to submit an output file instead of a program, and it is up to them whether they obtain the output files by writing a program (possibly exploiting special characteristics of the input), or by hand, or by a combination of these means. Pascal will have been removed as an available programming language by 2019.<ref name=\"minutes16\">{{cite web|title=Minutes of the Meetings held in Kazan, Russian Federation|url=http://www.ioinformatics.org/a_d_m/ga/ioi16/GAMinutesJuly2016.pdf|website=ioinformatics.org|publisher=General Assembly of International Olympiad in Informatics|pages=7, 11|format=PDF|date=19 August 2016}}</ref><sup>:11</sup>\n\nIOI 2010 for the first time had a live web scoreboard with real-time provisional results.  Submissions will be scored as soon as possible during the contest, and the results posted. Contestants will be aware of their scores, but not others', and may resubmit to improve their scores. Starting from 2012, IOI has been using the Contest Management System (CMS) for developing and monitoring the contest.\n\nThe scores from the two competition days and all problems are summed up separately for each contestant. At the awarding ceremony, contestants are awarded medals depending on their relative total score. The top 50% of the contestants are awarded medals, such that the relative number of gold : silver : bronze : no medal is approximately 1:2:3:6 (thus 1/12 of the contestants get a gold medal).\n\n[[File:IOI 2006 competition room.png|thumb|The competition room at the IOI 2006]]\n{{multiple image\n| footer = A bronze medal from IOI 2006 in Mexico\n | align     = right\n| image1   = IOI 2006 bronze medal (front).jpg\n| width1   = 150\n| alt1     =\n| caption1 = Front\n| image2   = IOI 2006 bronze medal (back).jpg\n| width2   = 150\n| alt2     =\n| caption2 = Back\n}}\n[[File:IOI Zagreb 1.JPG|thumb|In front of the competition room at the IOI 2007]]\nPrior to IOI 2010, students who did not receive medals did not have their scores published, making it impossible for a country to be ranked by adding together scores of its competitors unless each wins a medal. From IOI 2010, although the scores of students who did not receive medals are still not available in the official results, they are known from the live web scoreboard. In IOI 2012 the top 3 nations ranked by aggregate score (Russia, China and USA) were subsequently awarded during the closing ceremony.\n\nAnalysis of female performance shows 77.9 % of women obtain no medal, while 49.2 % of men obtain no medal. \"The average female participation was 4.4% in 1989\u20131994 and 2.2% in 1996\u20132014.\" It also suggests women participate much more on the national level, claiming sometimes a double-digit percentage of women participate on the first stage.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maggiolo|first1=Stefano|title=An Update on the Female Presence at the IOI|journal=Olympiads in Informatics|volume=9, 127\u2013137|issue=2015|pages=127|doi=10.15388/ioi.2015.10|url=http://ioinformatics.org/oi/pdf/v9_2015_127_137.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2017|publisher=ioinformatics.org|location=London, U.K.|format=PDF|year=2015}}</ref> President of the IOI, Richard Forster, says the competition has difficulty attracting women and that in spite of trying to solve it, \"none of us have hit on quite what the problem is, let alone the solution.\"<ref name=\"Robson\" />\n\nIn IOI 2017 held in Iran, due to not being able to participate in Iran, the Israeli students participated in an offsite competition organized by IOI in Russia.<ref name=\"minutes16\" /><sup>:11</sup> Due to visa issues, the full USA team was unable to attend, although one contestant Zhezheng Luo<ref>[http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/6410 Zhezheng Luo]</ref> was able to attend by traveling with the Chinese team<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sim\u00f5es|first1=Gabriel|title=IOI 2017, first round - Codeforces|url=http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/53550#comment-375744|website=Codeforces|accessdate=4 August 2017|date=31 July 2017|quote=There is really only one USA contestant on site, it looks like he came with the Chinese team (straight from China).}}</ref> and winning gold medal and 3rd place in standings.<ref name=\"standings2017\">[http://stats.ioinformatics.org/results/2017 IOI 2017: Results]</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Erectile dysfunction can have psychological consequences as it can be tied to relationship difficulties and [[self-image]].\n\n<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->\nThe most important organic causes of impotence are [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], neurological problems (for example, trauma from [[prostatectomy]] surgery), [[hormones|hormonal]] insufficiencies ([[hypogonadism]]) and [[Adverse drug reaction|drug side effects]]. [[Psychology|Psychological]] impotence is where erection or penetration fails due to thoughts or feelings (psychological reasons) rather than physical impossibility; this is somewhat less frequent but can often be helped. In psychological impotence, there is a strong [[placebo effect|response to placebo treatment]].\n\n<!-- Treatment -->\nBesides treating the underlying causes such as potassium deficiency or arsenic contamination of drinking water, the first line treatment of erectile dysfunction consists of a trial of [[PDE5 inhibitor]] (such as [[sildenafil]]). In some cases, treatment can involve [[prostaglandin]] tablets in the [[urethra]], injections into the penis, a [[penile prosthesis]], a [[penis pump]] or [[Vascular surgery|vascular reconstructive surgery]].<ref name=\"pmid15947645\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Montague DK, Jarow JP, Broderick GA, Dmochowski RR, Heaton JP, Lue TF, Milbank AJ, Nehra A, Sharlip ID | title = Chapter 1: The management of erectile dysfunction: an AUA update | journal = J.

The former uses the peripheral nerves and the lower parts of the spinal cord, whereas the latter uses the [[limbic system]] of the [[Human brain|brain]]. In both cases, an intact neural system is required for a successful and complete erection. Stimulation of the penile shaft by the [[nervous system]] leads to the secretion of [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which causes the relaxation of smooth muscles of [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]] (the main erectile tissue of penis), and subsequently penile erection.  Additionally, adequate levels of [[testosterone]] (produced by the [[testes]]) and an intact [[pituitary gland]] are required for the development of a healthy erectile system. As can be understood from the mechanisms of a normal erection, impotence may develop due to hormonal deficiency, disorders of the neural system, lack of adequate penile blood supply or psychological problems.<ref>{{cite book | author1 = Rany Shamloul | author2 = Anthony J Bella | title = Erectile Dysfunction | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=elg-AwAAQBAJ&pg=PR6 | date = 2014-03-01 | publisher = Biota Publishing | isbn = 978-1-61504-653-9 | pages = 6\u2013 }}</ref> [[Sexuality after spinal cord injury|Spinal cord injury causes sexual dysfunction]] including ED.

Some [[blood test]]s are generally done to exclude underlying disease, such as [[hypogonadism]] and [[prolactinoma]]. Impotence is also related to generally poor physical health, poor dietary habits, [[obesity]], and most specifically [[cardiovascular disease]] such as [[coronary artery disease]] and [[peripheral vascular disease]]. Therefore, a thorough [[physical examination]] is helpful, in particular the simple search for a previously undetected [[groin hernia (disambiguation)|groin hernia]]<!--intentional link to DAB page--> since it can affect sexual functions in men and is easily curable.<ref name=\"groin-cause\"/>\n\nA useful and simple way to distinguish between physiological and psychological impotence is to determine whether the patient ''ever'' has an erection. If ''never'', the problem is likely to be physiological; if ''sometimes'' (however rarely), it could be physiological or psychological.  The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental diseases ([[DSM-IV]]) has included a listing for impotence.\n\n;Duplex ultrasound:[[Duplex ultrasound]] is used to evaluate blood flow, venous leak, signs of [[atherosclerosis]], and scarring or calcification of erectile tissue. Injecting [[prostaglandin]], a hormone-like stimulator produced in the body, induces the erection. Ultrasound is then used to see vascular dilation and measure penile [[blood pressure]].\n\n;Penile nerves function:Tests such as the [[bulbocavernosus reflex]] test are used to determine if there is sufficient nerve sensation in the penis. The physician squeezes the glans (head) of the penis, which immediately causes the anus to contract if nerve function is normal. A physician measures the latency between squeeze and contraction by observing the anal sphincter or by feeling it with a gloved finger inserted past the anus.\n\n;Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT):It is normal for a man to have five to six erections during sleep, especially during [[REM sleep|rapid eye movement (REM)]]. Their absence may indicate a problem with nerve function or blood supply in the penis. There are two methods for measuring changes in penile rigidity and circumference during nocturnal erection: snap gauge and strain gauge. A significant proportion of men who have no sexual dysfunction nonetheless do not have regular nocturnal erections.\n\n;Penile biothesiometry:This test uses electromagnetic vibration to evaluate sensitivity and nerve function in the glans and shaft of the penis.\n\n;Dynamic infusion cavernosometry (DICC): technique in which fluid is pumped into the penis at a known rate and pressure. It gives a measurement of the vascular pressure in the corpus cavernosum during an erection.\n\n;Corpus cavernosometry:[[#Corpus Cavernosometry|Cavernosography]] measurement of the vascular pressure in the corpus cavernosum.  Saline is infused under pressure into the corpus cavernosum with a butterfly needle, and the flow rate needed to maintain an erection indicates the degree of venous leakage. The leaking veins responsible may be visualized by infusing a mixture of saline and x-ray contrast medium and performing a cavernosogram.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dawson C, Whitfield H | title = ABC of urology.

That date is important to the official justifications of the Reagan administration because the government claimed that the secret arms shipments were in exchange for Iranian cooperation with the release of hostages held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, where the first hostage was taken in 1982. But if an agreement to send secret arms shipments to Iran, and the fact of those shipments, both began before 1982, then the release of the hostages cannot be the reason for the arms shipments. As reported in the New York Times in 1991, \"continuing allegations that Reagan campaign officials made a deal with the Iranian Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the fall of 1980\" led to \"limited investigations.\" However \"limited,\" those investigations established that \"Soon after taking office in 1981, the Reagan Administration secretly and abruptly changed United States policy.\" The secret arms shipments to Iran began in that year, even as, in public, \"the Reagan Administration\" presented a different face, and \"aggressively promoted a public campaign... to stop worldwide transfers of military goods to Iran.\" The New York Times declined to propose a hypothesis for the arms shipments: \"No American rationale for permitting covert arms sales to Iran could be established,\" but the 'arms-for-hostages' explanation, by this chronology, is effectively ruled out. The official documents 'establishing' the beginning of this policy as dating to 1985, therefore, may perhaps be interpreted as part of a paper trail to establish the 'arms-for-hostages' cover story, in case the secret arms shipments to Iran were discovered.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/world/iran-pipeline-hidden-chapter-special-report-us-said-have-allowed-israel-sell.html|title=The Iran Pipeline: A Hidden Chapter/A special report.; U.S. Said to Have Allowed Israel to Sell Arms to Iran|last=Hersh|first=Seymour|date=8 December 1991|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser [[Robert McFarlane]] wrote a National Security Decision Directive which called for the United States to begin a rapprochement with the Islamic Republic of Iran.<ref name=\"Kornbluh, Peter page 213\" /> The paper read:\n\n<blockquote>Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran.

The dealings with the Iranians were conducted via the NSC with Admiral Poindexter and his deputy Colonel North, with the American historians Malcolm Byrne and Peter Kornbluh writing that Poindexter granted much power to North \"...who made the most of the situation, often deciding important matters on his own, striking outlandish deals with the Iranians, and acting in the name of the president on issues that were far beyond his competence.

Depending upon one's political perspective, the Congressional investigation into the Iran\u2013Contra affair was either an attempt by the legislative arm to gain control over an out-of-control executive arm, a partisan \"witch hunt\" by the Democrats against a Republican administration or a feeble effort by Congress that did far too little to rein in the \"imperial presidency\" that had run amok by breaking numerous laws.<ref>Masker, John Scott \"Teaching the Iran-Contra Affair\" pages 701\u2013703 from  ''PS: Political Science and Politics'', Volume 29, Issue # 4, December 1996 page 701.</ref> The Democratic-controlled [[United States Congress]] issued its own report on 18 November 1987, stating that \"If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have.\"<ref name=\"reagan no-bbc\"/> The congressional report wrote that the president bore \"ultimate responsibility\" for wrongdoing by his aides, and his administration exhibited \"secrecy, deception and disdain for the law\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/print/0,3858,5211614-103677,00.html|title=Nixon's Empire Strikes Back|author=Blumenthal, Sidney|work=The Guardian|date=9 June 2005|accessdate=6 June 2008 | location=London}}</ref> It also read that \"the central remaining question is the role of the President in the Iran\u2013Contra affair.

And as frustrating as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper to come to you with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.<ref name=\"pbs-speech\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe then took full responsibility for the acts committed:\n<blockquote>First, let me say [[the buck stops here|I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my administration]]. As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I'm still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.<ref name=\"pbs-speech\"/></blockquote>\n\nFinally, the president stated that his previous assertions that the U.S. did not trade arms for hostages were incorrect:\n<blockquote>A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.<ref name=\"pbs-speech\"/></blockquote>\n\nTo this day, Reagan's role in these transactions is not definitively known; it is unclear exactly what Reagan knew and when, and whether the arms sales were motivated by his desire to save the U.S. hostages. [[Oliver North]] wrote that \"Ronald Reagan knew of and approved a great deal of what went on with both the Iranian initiative and private efforts on behalf of the contras and he received regular, detailed briefings on both...I have no doubt that he was told about the use of residuals for the Contras, and that he approved it.

They also produced one notable business application, a [[relational database]] called ''[[Cornerstone (software)|Cornerstone]]''.<ref name=briceno2000/>\n\nInfocom was founded on June 22, 1979 by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] staff and students led by [[Dave Lebling]], [[Marc Blank]], [[Albert Vezza]], and [[Joel Berez]] and lasted as an independent company until 1986 when it was bought by [[Activision]]. Activision finally shut down the Infocom division in 1989, although they released some titles in the 1990s under the Infocom ''[[Zork]]'' brand. Activision abandoned the Infocom trademark in 2002.\n\n==Overview==\nInfocom games are [[text adventure]]s where users direct the action by entering short strings of words to give commands when prompted. Generally the program will respond by describing the results of the action, often the contents of a room if the player has moved within the virtual world. The user reads this information, decides what to do, and enters another short series of words. Examples include \"go west\" or \"take flashlight\".\n\nInfocom games were written using a roughly [[LISP]]-like programming language called ''ZIL'' (Zork Implementation Language or Zork Interactive Language\u2014it was referred to as both) that compiled into a [[byte code]] able to run on a standardized [[virtual machine]] called the [[Z-machine]].  As the games were text based and used variants of the same Z-machine interpreter, the interpreter had to be ported to new [[computer architecture]]s only once per architecture, rather than once per game. Each game file included a sophisticated [[parser]] which allowed the user to type complex instructions to the game. Unlike earlier works of interactive fiction which only understood commands of the form 'verb noun', Infocom's parser could understand a wider variety of sentences. For instance one might type \"open the large door, then go west\", or \"go to festeron\".<ref>[http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=1795 The ''Wishbringer'' manual] with more examples of complex commands possible with Infocom games.</ref>\n\nWith the Z-machine, Infocom was able to release most of their games for most popular [[home computer]]s of the day simultaneously\u2014the [[Apple II family]], [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s, [[Amstrad CPC]]/[[Amstrad PCW|PCW]] (one disc worked on both machines), [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Plus/4]], [[Commodore 128]],<ref>Infocom was actually one of the very few companies to release game software for the [[Commodore 128|C128]]'s native mode, contrary to most software houses' practice of only catering for the combined C64/128 market (as the C128 was compatible with the C64)</ref> [[Kaypro]] [[CP/M]], [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A]], [[Apple Macintosh|the Mac]], [[Atari ST]], the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] and the Radio Shack [[TRS-80]].  The company was also known for shipping creative props, or \"[[feelies]]\" (and even \"smellies\"), with its games.\n<!-- Note 1: Infocom was actually one of the very few companies (if not the only one) to release game software for the C128 as such, contrary to most software houses, who only catered for the C64(and thence the compatible C128 in C64 mode only) -->\n\n==History==\n\n===The beginning===\n[[File:Zork I screenshot video game Gargoyle interpreter on Ubuntu Linux.png|thumb|300px|''[[Zork I]]'' was Infocom's first product.  This screenshot of ''Zork I'' is representative of the sort of interaction a player has with Infocom's [[interactive fiction]] titles.  Here it is depicted running on a modern [[Z-machine (interpreter)|Z-machine interpreter]].]]\n\nInspired by ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Colossal Cave]]'', Marc Blank and Dave Lebling created what was to become the first Infocom game, ''[[Zork]]'', in 1977 at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[Project MAC|Laboratory for Computer Science]].  Despite the development of a revolutionary virtual memory system that allowed games to be much larger than the average personal computer's normal capacity, the enormous mainframe-developed game had to be split into three roughly equal parts.  ''Zork I'' was released originally for the [[TRS-80]] in 1980<ref name=\"zzap64.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/zzap13/four_minds01.html|title=Four Minds Forever Voyaging (Part I)}}</ref> and eventually sold more than a million copies across several platforms. Even though Microsoft released a cheap version of Adventure with its initial version of MS-DOS 1.0 for [[IBM PC]]s, ''Zork I'' was still a popular seller for the PC, thanks to the superior quality of its writing and packaging.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nLebling and Blank each authored several more games and additional game writers (or \"[[Implementer (video games)|Implementors]]\") were hired, notably including [[Steve Meretzky]].<ref name=\"zzap64.co.uk\"/> Other popular and inventive titles included a number of sequels and spinoff games in the ''Zork'' series, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' by [[Douglas Adams]], and ''[[A Mind Forever Voyaging]]''.<ref name=\"zzap64.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn its first few years of operation, text adventures proved to be a huge revenue stream for the company.  Whereas most computer games of the era would achieve initial success and then suffer a significant drop-off in sales, Infocom titles continued to sell for years and years.  Employee [[Tim Anderson (Zork)|Tim Anderson]] said of their situation, \"It was phenomenal \u2013 we had a basement that just printed money.\"<ref name=briceno2000/> By 1983 Infocom was perhaps the most dominant computer-game company; for example, all ten of its games were on the ''Softsel'' top 40 list of best-selling computer games for the week of December 12, 1983, with ''Zork'' in first place and two others in the top ten.{{r|maher20130320}} In late 1984, management declined an offer by publisher [[Simon & Schuster]] to acquire Infocom for $28&nbsp;million, far more than the board of directors's valuation of $10\u201312&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"maher20131023\">{{cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2013/10/masters-of-the-game/ |title=Masters of the Game |work=The Digital Antiquarian |date=October 23, 2013 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref> In 1993 ''Computer Gaming World'' described this era as the \"Cambridge [[Camelot]], where the [[Great Underground Empire]] was formed\".<ref name=\"cgw199307\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=108 |title=The 7th International Computer Game Developers Conference |work=Computer Gaming World |date=July 1993 |accessdate=July 12, 2014 |page=34}}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\nInfocom games were popular, ''[[InfoWorld]]'' said in 1984, in part because  \"in offices all over America (more than anyone realizes) executives and managers are playing games on their computers\".{{r|mace19840402}} Infocom stated that year that 75% of players were over 25 years old and that 80% were men; more women played its games than other companies', especially the mysteries.

Berez stated that \"there is no noticeable correlation between graphics machines and our penetration. There is a high correlation between the price of the machine and our sales ... people who are putting more money into their machines tend to buy more of our software\".<ref name=\"ferrell198801\">{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-01-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_092_1988_Jan#page/n17/mode/2up |title=Interactive Text in an Animated Age |work=Compute! |date=January 1988 |accessdate=November 10, 2013 |author=Ferrell, Keith |page=17}}</ref> Since their games were text-based, patrons of bookstores were drawn to the Infocom games as they were already interested in reading.  Unlike most computer software, Infocom titles were distributed under a no-returns policy,{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} which allowed them to make money from a single game for a longer period of time.\n\nNext, Infocom titles featured strong storytelling and rich descriptions, eschewing the inherent restrictions of graphic displays and allowing users to use their own imaginations for the lavish and exotic locations the games described.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Crib Sheet|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=24 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=December 1996|page=26}}</ref> Infocom's puzzles were unique in that they were usually tightly integrated into the storyline, and rarely did gamers feel like they were being made to jump through one arbitrary hoop after another, as was the case in many of the competitors' games. The puzzles were generally logical but also required close attention to the clues and hints given in the story, causing many gamers to keep copious notes as they went along.\n\nSometimes, though, Infocom threw in puzzles just for the humor of it\u2014if the user never ran into these, they could still finish the game. But discovering these early [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter Eggs]] was satisfying for some fans of the games. For example, one popular Easter egg was in the ''[[Enchanter (computer game)|Enchanter]]'' game, which involves collecting magic spells to use in accomplishing the quest. One of these is a summoning spell, which the player needs to use to summon certain characters at different parts of the game. At one point the game mentions the \"[[Implementer (video games)|Implementer]]s\" who were responsible for creating the land of Zork. If the player tries to summon the Implementers, the game produces a vision of [[Dave Lebling]] and [[Marc Blank]] at their computers, surprised at this \"bug\" in the game and working feverishly to fix it.\n\nThird, the inclusion of \"feelies\"\u2014imaginative props and extras tied to the game's theme\u2014provided [[copy protection]] against [[Copyright infringement of software|copyright infringement]].{{r|dyer19840506}} Some games were unsolvable without the extra content provided with the boxed game. And because of the cleverness and uniqueness of the [[feelies]], users rarely felt like they were an intrusion or inconvenience, as was the case with most of the other copy-protection schemes of the time.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nAlthough Infocom started out with ''Zork'', and although the ''Zork'' world was the centerpiece of their product line throughout the ''Zork'' and ''Enchanter'' series, the company quickly branched out into a wide variety of story lines: fantasy, science-fiction, mystery, horror, historical adventure, children's stories, and others that defied easy categorization. In an attempt to reach out to female customers, Infocom also produced ''[[Plundered Hearts]]'', which cast the gamer in the role of the heroine of a swashbuckling adventure on the high seas, and which required the heroine to use more feminine tactics to win the game, since hacking-and-slashing was not a very ladylike way to behave. And to compete with the ''[[Leisure Suit Larry]]'' style games that were also appearing, Infocom also came out with ''[[Leather Goddesses of Phobos]]'' in 1986, which featured \"tame\", \"suggestive\", and \"lewd\" playing modes. It included among its \"feelies\" a \"scratch-and-sniff\" card with six odors that corresponded to cues given to the player during the game.\n\n====Invisiclues====\nOriginally, hints for the game were provided as a \"pay-per-hint\" service created by [[Mike Dornbrook]], called the Zork Users Group (ZUG).  Dornbrook also started Infocom's customer newsletter, called ''The New Zork Times'', to discuss game hints and preview and showcase new products.\n\nThe pay-per-hint service eventually led to the development of [[InvisiClues]]: books with hints, maps, clues and solutions for puzzles in the games. The answers to the puzzles were printed in [[invisible ink]] that only became visible when rubbed with a special marker that was provided with each book. Usually, two or more answers were given for each question that a gamer might have. The first answer would provide a subtle hint, the second a less subtle hint, and so forth until the last one gave an explicit [[Strategy guide|walkthrough]]. Gamers could thus reveal only the hints that they needed to have to play the game.  To prevent the mere questions (printed in normal ink) from giving away too much information about the game, a certain number of misleading fake questions were included in every InvisiClues book. Answers to these questions would start by giving misleading or impossible to carry out answers, before the final answer revealed that the question was a fake (and usually admonishing the player that revealing random clues from the book would [[spoiler (media)|spoil]] their enjoyment of the game). The InvisiClues books were regularly ranked in near the top of best seller lists for computer books.<ref name=briceno2000/>\n\nIn the Solid Gold line of re-releases, InvisiClues were integrated into the game.  By typing \"HINT\" twice the player would open up a screen of possible topics where they could then reveal one hint at a time for each puzzle, just like the books.\n\n====Interactive fiction====\nInfocom also released a small number of \"interactive fiction paperbacks\" ([[gamebooks]]), which were based on the games and featured the ability to choose a different path through the story. Similar to the ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' series, every couple of pages the book would give the reader the chance to make a choice, such as which direction they wanted to go or how they wanted to respond to another character. The reader would then choose one of the given answers and turn to the appropriate page. These books, however, never did sell particularly well, and quickly disappeared from the bookshelves.\n\n===Cornerstone===\nDespite their success with computer games, Vezza and other company founders hoped to produce successful business programs like [[Lotus Development]], also founded by people from MIT<ref name=\"wilson199111\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=88 |title=A History of Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=November 1991 |accessdate=November 18, 2013 |author=Wilson, Johnny L. |page=10}}</ref> and located in the same building as Infocom. Lotus released its first product, [[Lotus 1-2-3|1-2-3]], in January 1983; within a year it had earned $53&nbsp;million, compared to Infocom's $6&nbsp;million. In 1982 Infocom started putting resources into a new division to produce business products.{{r|maher20130320}} In 1985 they released a [[relational database|database]] product, ''[[Cornerstone (software)|Cornerstone]]'', aimed at capturing the then booming database market for small business. Though this application was hailed upon its release for ease of use, it sold only 10,000 copies; not enough to cover the development expenses.<ref name=briceno2000/>\n\nThe program failed for a number of reasons.  Although it was packaged in a slick hard plastic carrying case and was a very good database for personal and home use, it was originally priced at [[United States dollar|USD]]$495 per copy and used copy-protected disks. Another serious miscalculation was that the program did not include any kind of [[scripting language]], so it was not promoted by any of the database consultants that small businesses typically hired to create and maintain their DB applications. Reviewers were also consistently disappointed that Infocom\u2014noted for the natural language syntax of their games\u2014did not include a natural language query ability, which had been the most anticipated feature for this database application. In a final disappointment, ''Cornerstone'' was available only for [[IBM PC]]s; while ''Cornerstone'' had been programmed with its own virtual machine for maximum portability, it was not ported to any of the other platforms that Infocom supported for their games, so that feature had become essentially irrelevant. And because Cornerstone used this virtual machine for its processing, it suffered from slow, lackluster performance.<ref name=briceno2000/>\n\n===Changing marketplace===\nInfocom's games' sales benefited significantly from the portability offered by running on top of a virtual machine. ''InfoWorld'' wrote in 1984 that \"the company always sells games for computers you don't normally think of as game machines, such as the [[DEC Rainbow]] or the [[Texas Instruments Professional Computer]]. This is one of the key reasons for the continued success of old titles such as Zork.\"<ref name=\"mace19840402\">{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA65&pg=PA56#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Games with windows |work=InfoWorld |date=April 2, 1984 |accessdate=February 10, 2015 |author=Mace, Scott |pages=56}}</ref> Dornbrook estimated that year that of the 1.8&nbsp;million home computers in America, one half million homes had Infocom games (\"all, if you count the pirated games\").{{r|dyer19840506}} Computer companies sent prototypes of new systems to encourage Infocom to port Z-machine to them; the virtual machine supported more than 20 different systems, including [[orphaned technology|orphaned computers]] for which Infocom games were among the only commercial products. The company produced the only third-party games available for the Macintosh at launch,{{r|maher20130320}} and Berlyn promised that all 13 of its games would be available for the Atari ST within one month of its release.<ref name=chinsoft19850128>{{cite news|author=Chin, Kathy|title=Atari Promises Software For ST|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6i4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA15\n|work=InfoWorld|date=January 28, 1985|accessdate=March 19, 2011|page=17}}</ref>\n\nThe virtual machine significantly slowed ''Cornerstone''{{'}}s execution speed, however. Businesses were moving ''en masse'' to the IBM PC platform by that time, so portability was no longer a significant differentiator. Infocom had sunk much of the money from games sales into ''Cornerstone''; this, in addition to a slump in computer game sales, left the company in a very precarious financial position. By the time Infocom removed the copy-protection and reduced the price to less than $100, it was too late, and the market had moved on to other database solutions.\n\nBy 1982 the market was moving to graphic adventures. Infocom was interested in producing them, that year proposing to [[Penguin Software]] that Antonio Antiochia, author of its ''[[Transylvania (computer game)|Transylvania]]'', provide artwork. Within Infocom the game designers tended to oppose graphics, while marketing and business employees supported using them for the company to remain competitive. The partnership negotiations failed, in part because of the difficulty of adding graphics to the Z-machine, and Infocom instead began a series of advertisements mocking graphical games as \"graffiti\" compared to the human imagination. The marketing campaign was very successful, and Infocom's success led to other companies like [[Broderbund]] and [[Electronic Arts]] also releasing their own text games.{{r|dyer19840506}}<ref name=\"maher20130320\">{{cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2013/03/the-top-of-its-game/ |title=The Top of its Game |work=The Digital Antiquarian |date=March 20, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2014 |author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref>\n\n===Activision takeover===\nAfter Cornerstone's failure, Infocom laid off half of its 100 employees,<ref name=\"oxner198605\">{{cite magazine |title=Hobby & Industry News |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=28 |date=May 1986 |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&pub=2&id=28 |accessdate=May 21, 2016| last=Oxner |first=Bill |page=4}}</ref> and [[Activision]] acquired the company on June 13, 1986 for $7.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"wilson199111\"/> Berez stated that although the two companies' headquarters and product lines would remain separate, \"One of the effects of the merger will be for both of us to broaden our horizons\".

Davis believed that his company had paid too much for Infocom and initiated a lawsuit against them to recoup some of the cost, along with changing the way Infocom was run. For example:\n* Davis required they use Activision's packaging plant instead of their own in-house one, raising the cost of each package from $0.45 to over $0.90. In addition, the Activision plant made numerous mistakes in packaging, whereas the Infocom one almost never did.\n* Infocom had a successful marketing approach that kept its [[backlist]] in store inventories for years. Because of this, older titles continued to sell, and their sales rose when the company released newer games. ''Zork'' especially benefited; its sales rose for years after its initial release in 1980. To Infocom's surprise it sold almost 100,000 copies of the game in 1983, and the figure rose by more than 50% in 1984.{{r|maher20130320}}<ref name=\"tommervik198303\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&pub=6&id=10 |title=By Golly, That's a Good Game! / Masters of the Mousetrap Maxim Tell Why |work=Softline |date=March 1983 |accessdate=July 28, 2014 |author=Tommervik, Margot Comstock |pages=30\u201332}}</ref> Activision preferred to market Infocom's games the way they marketed their other titles: replacing older titles with newer ones. While this made sense for the graphically intensive games that made up the rest of Activision's catalog, since Infocom games were text based, it didn't make sense - the newer games didn't have improved ''text''. This marketing approach cut off potential revenue for numerous Infocom titles that had consistently brought in money for several years.\n* Davis required the struggling developer to produce eight titles a year. Infocom had traditionally produced about four games per year with more staff than they had post-merger.\n* Davis pushed Infocom to release more graphical games, but the one they did release, ''[[Fooblitzky]]'', bombed. This was, in part, due to Infocom's long-standing rule of maximum portability; a game that could display graphics on a number of different systems couldn't take advantage of the strengths of any of them.\n* The cost of acquisition was amortized by deducting it from Infocom's operating revenue during the next several years.\n\n===Closure and afterward===\nBy 1988, rumors spread of disputes between Activision and Infocom.<ref name=\"cgw198804\">{{cite magazine| title=Rumored Activision/Infocom Rift Unfounded |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=46 |date=April 1988 |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&pub=2&id=46 |accessdate=May 21, 2016 |page=9}}</ref> Infocom employees reportedly believed that Activision gave poorer-quality games to Infocom, such as [[Tom Snyder Productions]]' unsuccessful ''Infocomics''.

These compilations featured nearly every game produced by Infocom before 1988. (''[[Leather Goddesses of Phobos]]'' was not included in either bundle, but could be ordered via a coupon included with ''Lost Treasures II''.) The compilations lacked the \"feelies\" that came with each game, but in some cases included photographs of them. In 1996, the first bundles were followed by ''[[Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom]]'', a single CD-ROM which contained the works of both collections. This release, however, was missing ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' and ''Shogun'' because the licenses from Douglas Adams' and [[James Clavell]]'s estates had expired.\n\nIn 2008 a back-up with the [[source code]] of all Infocom's video games appeared from an anonymous source and was archived by [[Internet Archive]]'s [[Jason Scott]].<ref>[http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/3778 GET LAMP Raw Interviews Pretty Much Up] on ascii.[[textfiles.com]] by [[Jason Scott]] (December 3, 2012)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/04/infocom-drive-t/| title='Infocom Drive' Turns Up Long-Lost Hitchhiker Sequel |date=April 18, 2008 |quote=''Remnants of the unreleased sequel to Infocom's text adventure version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy have been made available to the public by Waxy.org.

This feature meant that interactive fiction games were easily ported across all the popular platforms at the time, including [[CP/M]] (not known for gaming or strong graphics capabilities). The number of interactive fiction works is increasing steadily as new ones are produced by an online community, using freely available development systems.\n\nThe term can also be used to refer to digital versions of literary works that are not read in a linear fashion, known as [[gamebooks]], where the reader is instead given choices at different points in the text; these decisions determine the flow and outcome of the story.

(2002) ''High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games'' McGraw-Hill/Osborne, Berkeley, Calif., p. 52, {{ISBN|0-07-222428-2}}</ref> Later parsers could handle increasing levels of complexity parsing sentences such as \"open the red box with the green key then go north\". This level of complexity is the standard for works of interactive fiction today.\n\nDespite their lack of graphics, text adventures include a physical dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms to indicate how much gameplay they offered.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> These games are unique in that they may create an ''illogical space'', where going north from area A takes you to area B, but going south from area B did not take you back to area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players expect, and thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today's era of 3D gaming,<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles for the sake of puzzles' and that they can, in the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.\n\nInteractive fiction shares much in common with [[MUD|Multi-User Dungeons]] ('MUDs'). MUDs, which became popular in the mid-1980s, rely on a textual exchange and accept similar commands from players as do works of IF; however, since interactive fiction is single player, and MUDs, by definition, have multiple players, they differ enormously in gameplay styles. MUDs often focus gameplay on activities that involve communities of players, simulated political systems, in-game trading, and other gameplay mechanics that are not possible in a single player environment.\n\n===Writing style===\nInteractive fiction features two distinct modes of writing: the player input and the game output. As described above, player input is expected to be in simple command form ([[Sentence (linguistics)#Classification by purpose|imperative sentences]]).<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Text Adventure|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=41}}</ref> A typical command may be:<blockquote><tt>> PULL Lever</tt></blockquote>\n\nThe responses from the game are usually written from a [[Second-person narrative|second-person]] [[point of view (literature)|point of view]], in [[present tense]]. This is because, unlike in most works of fiction, the main character is closely associated with the player, and the events are seen to be happening as the player plays. While older text adventures often identified the protagonist with the player directly, newer games tend to have specific, well-defined protagonists with separate identities from the player.

A typical response might look something like this, the response to \"look in tea chest\" at the start of ''[[Curses (video game)|Curses]]'':\n\n<blockquote><tt>\"That was the first place you tried, hours and hours ago now, and there's nothing there but that boring old book. You pick it up anyway, bored as you are.\"</tt><ref name=\"cursesplay\">[[Graham Nelson|Nelson, Graham]] ''[[Curses (video game)|Curses]]'', 1993.</ref></blockquote> <!-- Taken from Curses, in response to \"look in teachest\" from the first prompt -->\n\nMany text adventures, particularly those designed for humour (such as ''[[Zork]]'', ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and ''[[Leather Goddesses of Phobos]]''), address the player with an informal tone, sometimes including sarcastic remarks (see the transcript from ''Curses'', above, for an example). The late Douglas Adams, in designing the IF version of his 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', created a unique solution to the final puzzle of the game: the game requires the one solitary item that the player ''didn't'' choose at the outset of play.\n\nSome IF works dispense with second-person narrative entirely, opting for a first-person perspective ('I') or even placing the player in the position of an observer, rather than a direct participant. In some 'experimental' IF, the concept of self-identification is eliminated entirely, and the player instead takes the role of an inanimate object, a force of nature, or an abstract concept; experimental IF usually pushes the limits of the concept and challenges many assumptions about the medium.\n\n==History==\n\n===1960s and 70s===\n\n====Natural language processing====\nThough neither program was developed as a narrative work, the software programs [[ELIZA]] (1964\u20131966) and [[SHRDLU]] (1968\u20131970) can formally be considered early examples of interactive fiction, as both programs used [[natural language processing]] to take input from their user and respond in a virtual and conversational manner. ELIZA simulated a psychotherapist that appeared to provide human-like responses to the user's input, while SHRDLU employed an artificial intelligence that could move virtual objects around an environment and respond to questions asked about the environment's shape. The development of effective natural language processing would become an essential part of interactive fiction development.<ref>{{cite book | last = Montfort | first = Nick | year = 2003 | title = Twisty Little Passages: An Approach To Interactive Fiction | publisher = Cambridge: The MIT Press | isbn = 0-262-13436-5| pages = 84\u201385}}</ref>\n\n====''Adventure''====\nAround 1975, [[Will Crowther]], a programmer and an amateur caver, wrote the first text adventure game, ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' (originally called ''ADVENT'' because a filename could only be six characters long in the [[operating system]] he was using, and later named ''Colossal Cave Adventure'').<ref name=\"jerz\">{{cite web | author = Jerz, Dennis G. | date = 2004-02-17 | url = http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/canon/Adventure.htm | title = Colossal Cave Adventure (c. 1975) | work =  | publisher = Dennis G.

Over the course of a few weekends, he wrote a text based cave exploration game that featured a sort of guide/narrator who talked in full sentences and who understood simple two word commands that came close to natural English. Adventure was programmed in [[Fortran]] for the [[PDP-10]]. Crowther's original version was an accurate [[simulation]] of part of the real [[Mammoth Cave National Park|Colossal Cave]], but also included fantasy elements (such as axe-wielding dwarves and a magic bridge).\n\nStanford University graduate student [[Don Woods (programmer)|Don Woods]] discovered ''Adventure'' while working at the [[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], and in 1977 obtained and expanded Crowther's source code (with Crowther's permission).

The game has since been ported to many other [[operating system]]s, and was included with the floppy-disk distribution of Microsoft's [[MS-DOS]] 1.0 OS. ''Adventure'' is a cornerstone of the online IF community; there currently exist dozens of different independently-programmed versions, with additional elements, such as new rooms or puzzles, and various scoring systems.\n\nThe popularity of ''Adventure'' led to the wide success of interactive fiction during the late 1970s, when home computers had little, if any, graphics capability. Many elements of the original game have survived into the present, such as the command '[[xyzzy (magic word)|xyzzy]]', which is now included as an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter Egg]] in modern games, such as ''[[Microsoft Minesweeper]]''.\n\n''Adventure'' was also directly responsible for the founding of Sierra Online (later [[Sierra Entertainment]]); [[Ken Williams (game developer)|Ken]] and [[Roberta Williams]] played the game and decided to design one of their own,<ref name=\"jerz\"/> but with graphics.\n\n====Commercial era====\n[[Adventure International]] was founded by [[Scott Adams (game designer)|Scott Adams]] (not to be confused with the creator of [[Dilbert]]). In 1978, Adams wrote ''[[Adventureland (video game)|Adventureland]]'', which was loosely patterned after (the original) ''Colossal Cave Adventure''. He took out a small ad in a computer magazine in order to promote and sell ''Adventureland'', thus creating the first commercial adventure game. In 1979 he founded Adventure International, the first commercial publisher of interactive fiction. That same year, ''[[Dog Star Adventure]]'' was published in [[source code]] form in ''[[SoftSide]]'', spawning legions of similar games in [[BASIC]].\n\nThe largest company producing works of interactive fiction was [[Infocom]],<ref name=\"dm4-46\">{{cite web | author = Graham Nelson | date = July 2001 | url = http://www.inform-fiction.org/manual/html/s46.html | title = A short history of interactive fiction | work = The Inform Designer's Manual | accessdate = 2006-11-01 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070827050426/http://www.inform-fiction.org/manual/html/s46.html | archivedate = 27 August 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> which created the ''[[Zork]]'' series and many other titles, among them ''[[Trinity (video game)|Trinity]]'', ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and ''[[A Mind Forever Voyaging]]''.\n\nIn June 1977, [[Marc Blank]], Bruce K. Daniels, [[Tim Anderson (Zork)|Tim Anderson]], and [[Dave Lebling]] began writing the mainframe version of ''Zork'' (also known as ''Dungeon''), at the [[MIT Laboratory for Computer Science]]. The game was programmed in a computer language called [[MDL programming language|MDL]], a variant of [[LISP programming language|LISP]].\n\nThe term Implementer was the self-given name of the creators of the text adventure series Zork. It is for this reason that game designers and programmers can be referred to as an [[Implementer (video games)|implementer]], often shortened to Imp, rather than a writer.\n\nIn early 1979, the game was completed. Ten members of the ''MIT Dynamics Modelling Group'' went on to join Infocom when it was incorporated later that year.\n\nIn order to make its games as portable as possible, Infocom developed the [[Z-machine (interpreter)|Z-machine]], a custom [[virtual machine]] that could be implemented on a large number of platforms, and took standardized \"story files\" as input.\n\nIn a non-technical sense, Infocom was responsible for developing the interactive style that would be emulated by many later interpreters. The Infocom [[parser]] was widely regarded as the best of its era. It accepted complex, complete sentence commands like \"put the blue book on the writing desk\" at a time when most of its competitors parsers were restricted to simple two word verb-noun combinations such as \"put book\". The parser was actively upgraded with new features like undo and error correction, and later games would 'understand' multiple sentence input: 'pick up the gem and put it in my bag. take the newspaper clipping out of my bag then burn it with the book of matches'.\n\nSeveral companies offered optional commercial [[feelie]]s (physical props associated with a game). The tradition of 'feelies' (and the term itself) is believed to have originated with ''[[Deadline (video game)|Deadline]]'' (1982), the third Infocom title after ''Zork I'' and ''II''.<ref>{{cite web | author = Allen Varney | date = 2006-12-09 | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_62/365-Feelies | work = The Escapist, Issue #64 | title = Feelies | accessdate = 2009-07-10 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012153126/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_62/365-Feelies | archivedate = 12 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup | title = FAQ 2/3: (2.3) How did Infocom make those neat packages? | author = Stephen van Egmond | date = 17 April 2004 | newsgroup = rec.games.int-fiction | url = http://www.faqs.org/faqs/games/interactive-fiction/part2/ | accessdate = 7 October 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090918154157/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/games/interactive-fiction/part2/ | archivedate = 18 September 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> When writing this game, it was not possible to include all of the information in the limited (80KB) disk space, so Infocom created the first feelies for this game; extra items that gave more information than could be included within the digital game itself. These included police interviews, the coroner's findings, letters, crime scene evidence and photos of the murder scene.\n\nThese materials were very difficult for others to copy or otherwise reproduce, and many included information that was essential to completing the game. Seeing the potential benefits of both aiding game-play immersion and providing a measure of creative copy-protection, in addition to acting as a deterrent to software piracy, Infocom and later other companies began creating feelies for numerous titles. In 1987, Infocom released a special version of the first three ''Zork'' titles together with plot-specific coins and other trinkets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Scheyen |year=1987 |url=http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/Articles/NZT/Tslspr87.html#ztrilogy |title=Genuine Zorkmid coin minted for the Zork Trilogy |accessdate=2009-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616010715/http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/Articles/NZT/Tslspr87.html |archivedate=16 June 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author = Robin Lionheart | year = 2009 | url = http://quendor.robinlionheart.com/zorkmid/ | title = The Zorkmid Project | accessdate = 2009-07-10 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090411143847/http://quendor.robinlionheart.com/zorkmid/ | archivedate = 11 April 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> This concept would be expanded as time went on, such that later game feelies would contain passwords, coded instructions, page numbers, or other information that would be required to successfully complete the game.\n\n===1980s===\n\n====United States====\nInteractive fiction became a standard product for many software companies. By 1982 ''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' wrote that \"the demands of the market are weighted heavily toward hi-res graphics\" in games like Sierra's ''[[The Wizard and the Princess]]'' and its imitators. Such [[graphic adventure]]s became the dominant form of the genre on computers with graphics, like the Apple II.<ref name=\"maher20120828\">{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2012/08/saga/ | title=SAGA | work=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2012-08-28 | accessdate=10 July 2014 | author=Maher, Jimmy | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711194415/http://www.filfre.net/2012/08/saga/ | archivedate=11 July 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> By 1982 [[Adventure International]] began releasing versions of its games with graphics.<ref name=\"maher20120828\" /> The company went bankrupt in 1985.

Leaving Infocom as the leading company producing text-only adventure games on the Apple II with sophisticated parsers and writing, and still advertising its lack of graphics as a virtue.<ref name=\"maher20120828\" /> The company was bought by [[Activision]] in 1986 after the failure of ''[[Cornerstone (software)|Cornerstone]]'', Infocom's database software program, and stopped producing text adventures a few years later. Soon after Telaium/Trillium also closed.\n\n====Outside the United States====\nProbably the first commercial work of interactive fiction produced outside the U.S. was the [[dungeon crawl]] game of ''[[Acheton]]'', produced in Cambridge, England, and first commercially released by [[Acornsoft]] (later expanded and reissued by [[Topologika]]). Other leading companies in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] were [[Magnetic Scrolls]] and [[Level 9 Computing]]. Also worthy of mention are [[Delta 4]], [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]], and the homebrew company [[Zenobi]].\n\nIn the early 1980s [[Edu-Ware]] also produced interactive fiction for the [[Apple II]] as designated by the \"if\" graphic that was displayed on startup. Their titles included the [[The Prisoner (video game)|''Prisoner'']] and ''Empire'' series (''Empire I: World Builders'', ''Empire II: Interstellar Sharks'', ''Empire III: Armageddon'').\n\nIn 1981, [[CE Software]] published ''[[SwordThrust]]'' as a commercial successor to the [[Eamon (video game)|''Eamon'']] gaming system for the Apple II. SwordThrust and Eamon were simple two-word parser games with many [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] elements not available in other interactive fiction.<ref name=\"Montfort\">{{cite book|last=Montfort|first=Nick|title=Twisty Little Passages: An Approach to Interactive Fiction|origyear=2004|year=2005|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-13436-1|page=196|chapter=The Independents|quote=Some special-purpose interactive fiction development systems were used by the ordinary home computer owner of the 1980s.

By March 1984, there were 48 titles published for the Eamon system (and over [[List of Eamon Adventures|270 titles]] in total as of March 2013).\n\nIn Italy, interactive fiction games were mainly published and distributed through various magazines in included tapes. The largest number of games were published in the two magazines Viking and Explorer,<ref name=\"fm-18\">{{cite web | author =  | url = http://ready64.it/articoli/leggi/idart/55/le-collane-avventurose-in-italia-parte-i-arscom-e-le-altre-realt%c3%a0 | title = Le collane avventurose in Italia (Adventure game series in Italy) | language = Italian | work = Ready64 | publisher = Roberto Nicoletti | accessdate = 2008-03-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100314040535/http://ready64.it/articoli/leggi/idart/55/le-collane-avventurose-in-italia-parte-i-arscom-e-le-altre-realt%C3%A0 | archivedate = 14 March 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> with versions for the main 8-bit home computers ([[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[MSX]]).

The wave of interactive fiction in Italy lasted for a couple of years thanks to the various magazines promoting the genre, then faded and remains still today a topic of interest for a small group of fans and less known developers, celebrated on Web sites and in related newsgroups.\n\nIn Spain, interactive fiction was considered a minority genre, and was not very successful. The first Spanish interactive fiction commercially released was ''Yenght'' in 1983, by [[Dinamic Software]], for the ZX Spectrum. Later on, in 1987, the same company produced an interactive fiction about ''Don Quijote''. After several other attempts, the company [[Aventuras AD]], emerged from Dinamic, became the main interactive fiction publisher in Spain, including titles like a Spanish adaptation of ''Colossal Cave Adventure'', an adaptation of the Spanish comic ''El Jabato'', and mainly the ''Ci-U-Than'' trilogy, composed by ''La diosa de Cozumel'' (1990), ''Los templos sagrados'' (1991) and ''Chichen Itz\u00e1'' (1992). During this period, the [[Club de Aventuras AD|Club de Aventuras AD (CAAD)]], the main Spanish speaking community around interactive fiction in the world, was founded, and after the end of Aventuras AD in 1992, the CAAD continued on its own, first with their own magazine, and then with the advent of Internet, with the launch of an active internet community that still produces interactive non commercial fiction nowadays.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caad.es/ |title=Club de Aventuras AD |publisher=Caad.es |date=2010-11-13 |accessdate=2011-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508122859/http://www.caad.es/ |archivedate=8 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===During the 1990s===\n[[Legend Entertainment]] was founded by [[Bob Bates]] and [[Mike Verdu]] in 1989. It started out from the ashes of Infocom. The text adventures produced by Legend Entertainment used (high-resolution) graphics as well as sound. Some of their titles include ''[[Eric the Unready]]'', the ''[[Spellcasting (series)|Spellcasting]]'' series and ''[[Gateway (video game)|Gateway]]'' (based on [[Frederik Pohl]]'s novels).\n\nThe last text adventure created by Legend Entertainment was ''[[Gateway (video game)|Gateway II]]'' (1992), while the last game ever created by Legend was ''[[Unreal II: The Awakening]]'' (2003) \u2013 the well-known [[first-person shooter]] action game using the [[Unreal Engine]] for both impressive graphics and realistic physics. In 2004, Legend Entertainment was acquired by [[Atari]], who published ''Unreal II'' and released for both Microsoft Windows and Microsoft's Xbox.\n\nMany other companies such as Level 9 Computing, Magnetic Scrolls, Delta 4 and Zenobi had closed by 1992.\n\nIn 1991 and 1992, [[Activision]] released ''[[The Lost Treasures of Infocom]]'' in two volumes, a collection containing most of Infocom's games, followed in 1996 by ''[[Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom]]''.\n\n===Modern era===\nAfter the decline of the commercial interactive fiction market in the 1990s, an online community eventually formed around the medium. In 1987, the [[Usenet]] newsgroup <tt>rec.arts.int-fiction</tt> was created, and was soon followed by <tt>rec.games.int-fiction</tt>. By custom, the topic of <tt>rec.arts.int-fiction</tt> is interactive fiction authorship and programming, while <tt>rec.games.int-fiction</tt> encompasses topics related to playing interactive fiction games, such as hint requests and game reviews. As of late 2011, discussions between writers have mostly moved from <tt>rec.arts.int-fiction</tt> to the Interactive Fiction Community Forum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intfiction.org/forum/|title=intfiction.org \u2022 Index page|website=www.intfiction.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225172346/http://www.intfiction.org/forum/|archivedate=25 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most important early developments was the reverse-engineering of Infocom's [[Z-machine|Z-Code]] format and [[Z-Machine]] [[virtual machine]] in 1987 by a group of enthusiasts called the [[InfoTaskForce]] and the subsequent development of an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for Z-Code story files. As a result, it became possible to play Infocom's work on modern computers.\n\nFor years, amateurs with the IF community produced interactive fiction works of relatively limited scope using the [[Adventure Game Toolkit]] and similar tools.\n\nThe breakthrough that allowed the interactive fiction community to truly prosper, however, was the creation and distribution of two sophisticated development systems. In 1987, Michael J. Roberts released [[TADS]], a programming language designed to produce works of interactive fiction. In 1993, [[Graham Nelson]] released [[Inform]], a [[programming language]] and set of libraries which [[compiler|compiled]] to a Z-Code story file. Each of these systems allowed anyone with sufficient time and dedication to create a game, and caused a growth boom in the online interactive fiction community.\n\nDespite the lack of commercial support, the availability of high quality tools allowed enthusiasts of the genre to develop new high quality games. Competitions such as the annual [[Interactive Fiction Competition]] for short works, the [[Spring Thing]] for longer works, and the [[XYZZY Awards]], further helped to improve the quality and complexity of the games. Modern games go much further than the original \"Adventure\" style, improving upon Infocom games, which relied extensively on puzzle solving, and to a lesser extent on communication with non player characters, to include experimentation with writing and story-telling techniques.\n\nWhile the majority of modern interactive fiction that is developed is distributed for free, there are some commercial endeavors. In 1998, [[Michael Berlyn]] a former an Implementor at Infocom, started a new game company, Cascade Mountain Publishing, whose goals were to publish interactive fiction. Despite the Interactive Fiction community providing social and financial backing Cascade Mountain Publishing went out of business in 2000.\n\nOther commercial endeavours include Peter Nepstad's ''[[1893: A World's Fair Mystery]]'', several games by Howard Sherman published as [[Malinche Entertainment]], The General Coffee Company's ''Future Boy!,'' ''[[Cypher (video game)|Cypher]]'', a graphically enhanced cyberpunk game and various titles by ''Textfyre''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.textfyre.com/ |title=Home of the Best Interactive Fiction |publisher=Textfyre.com |accessdate=2011-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202110329/http://textfyre.com/ |archivedate=2 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Emily Short]] was commissioned to develop the game ''City of Secrets'' but the project fell through and she ended up releasing it herself.<ref name=\"COS-upcoming\">{{cite web | author = Emily Short | date = 2003-10-05 | url = http://www.mindspring.com/~emshort/CSUpcoming2.htm | title = City of Secrets | accessdate = 2006-11-01 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070109050336/http://www.mindspring.com/~emshort/CSUpcoming2.htm | archivedate = 9 January 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nTo learn more about the history of interactive fiction, see the ''[[Get Lamp]]'' documentary.\n\n==Notable works==\n<!-- Note that this is notable works for \"text adventure\"-style interactive fiction.

Adventure's parsers could only handle two-word sentences in the form of verb-noun pairs.\n\n[[Infocom]]'s games of 1979-88, such as [[Zork]], were written using a [[LISP]]-like programming language called ZIL (Zork Implementation Language or Zork Interactive Language, it was referred to as both) that compiled into a [[byte code]] able to run on a standardized [[virtual machine]] called the [[Z-machine]]. As the games were text based and used variants of the same Z-machine interpreter, the interpreter only had to be ported to a [[computer]] once, rather than once each game. Each game file included a sophisticated [[parser]] which allowed the user to type complex instructions to the game. Unlike earlier works of interactive fiction which only understood commands of the form 'verb noun', Infocom's parser could understand a wider variety of sentences. For instance one might type \"open the large door, then go west\", or \"go to the hall\". With the Z-machine, Infocom was able to release most of their games for most popular [[home computer]]s of the time simultaneously, including [[Apple II family]], [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s, [[Amstrad CPC]]/[[Amstrad PCW|PCW]] (one disc worked on both machines), [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Plus/4]], [[Commodore 128]], [[Kaypro]] [[CP/M]], [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A]], [[Apple Macintosh|the Mac]], [[Atari ST]], the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] and the Radio Shack [[TRS-80]]. Infocom was also known for shipping creative props, or \"[[feelies]]\" (and even \"smellies\"), with its games.\n\nDuring the 1990s Interactive fiction was mainly written with C-like languages, such as [[TADS]] 2 and [[Inform]] 6. A number of systems for writing interactive fiction now exist. The most popular remain [[Inform]], [[TADS]], or [[ADRIFT]], but they diverged in their approach to IF-writing during the 2000s, giving today's IF writers an objective choice. By 2006 [[IFComp]], most games were written for Inform, with a strong minority of games for TADS and ADRIFT, followed by a small number of games for other systems.<ref name=\"ifcomp\">{{cite web| url = http://www.ifcomp.org/comp06/games.php| title = Games of the 12th Annual Interactive Fiction Competition| accessdate = 2006-12-17| year = 2006| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070103031237/http://www.ifcomp.org/comp06/games.php| archivedate = 3 January 2007| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhile familiarity with a programming language leads many new authors to attempt to produce their own complete IF application, most established IF authors recommend use of a specialised IF language, arguing that such systems allow authors to avoid the technicalities of producing a full featured parser, while allowing broad community support. The choice of [[authoring system]] usually depends on the author's desired balance of ease of use versus power, and the portability of the final product.<ref name=brasslantern>{{cite web| url = http://brasslantern.org/writers/howto/chooselang.html| title = Choosing a Text Adventure Language| accessdate = 2006-12-17| last = Granade| first = Stephen| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061205043134/http://brasslantern.org/writers/howto/chooselang.html| archivedate = 5 December 2006| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOther development systems include:\n* David Malmberg's [[Adventure Game Toolkit]] (AGT)\n* [[Incentive Software]]'s [[Graphic Adventure Creator]] (GAC)\n* Hugo\n* [[Professional Adventure Writer]]\n* [[Gilsoft]]'s [[The Quill Adventure System|The Quill]] \n* [[Twine (software)|Twine]]\n\n===Interpreters and virtual machines===\n[[Interpreter (computing)|Interpreters]] are the software used to play the works of interactive fiction created with a development system. Since they need to interact with the player, the \"story files\" created by development systems are programs in their own right. Rather than running directly on any one computer, they are programs run by Interpreters, or virtual machines, which are designed specially for IF. They may be part of the development system, or can be compiled together with the work of fiction as a standalone [[executable file]].\n\nThe Z-machine was designed by the founders of [[Infocom]], in 1979. They were influenced by the then-new idea of a [[P-machine|virtual Pascal computer]], but replaced P with Z for Zork, the celebrated adventure game of 1977-79. The Z-machine evolved during the 1980s but over 30 years later, it remains in use essentially unchanged. Glulx was designed by Andrew Plotkin in the late 1990s as a new-generation IF virtual machine. It overcomes the technical constraint on the Z-machine by being a 32-bit rather than 16-bit processor. [[Frotz]] is a modern Z-machine interpreter originally written in [[C (programming language)]] by Stefan Jokisch in 1995 for [[DOS]]. Over time it was ported to other platforms, such as Unix, RISC OS, Mac OS and most recently iOS. Modern Glulx interpreters are based on \"Glulxe\", by Andrew Plotkin, and \"Git\", by Iain Merrick. Other interpreters include Zoom for Mac OS X, or for Unix or Linux, maintained by Andrew Hunter, and Spatterlight for Mac OS X, maintained by Tor Andersson.\n\n===Distribution===\nIn addition to commercial distribution venues and individual websites, many works of free interactive fiction are distributed through community websites. These include the Interactive Fiction Database (IFDb), The Interactive Fiction Reviews Organization (IFRO), a game catalog and recommendation engine, and the Interactive Fiction Archive.\n\nWorks may be distributed for playing with in a separate interpreter. In which case they are often made available in the [[Blorb]] [[package format]] that many interpreters support. A filename ending .zblorb is a story file intended for a Z-machine in a Blorb wrapper, while a filename ending .gblorb is a story file intended for a Glulx in a Blorb wrapper. It is not common but IF files are sometimes also seen without a Blorb wrapping, though this usually means cover art, help files, and so forth are missing, like a book with the covers torn off. Z-machine story files usually have names ending .z5 or .z8, the number being a version number, and Glulx story files usually end .ulx.\n\nAlternatively, works may be distributed for playing in a [[web browser]]. For example, the 'Parchment' project is for web browser-based IF Interpreter, for both Z-machine and Glulx files.\n\nSome software such as [[Twine (software)|Twine]] publishes directly to [[HTML]], the standard language used to create [[web pages]], reducing the requirement for an Interpreter or virtual machine.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hypertext fiction]]\n* [[Visual novel]], interactive fiction with graphics.\n* {{Not a typo|[[Addventure]]}}<!-- Spelling as 'Addventure' is correct -->\n* [[Gamebook]]\n* [[Graphical adventure games|Graphic adventures]], adventure games with roots in interactive fiction.\n* [[Multi-User Dungeon]] (MUD), which may be considered as a kind of multiplayer or collaborative interactive fiction.\n* [[Role-playing game]]s, which are occasionally described as another form of interactive fiction.\n* [[Interactive storytelling]]\n* [[Get Lamp]], a documentary about interactive fiction\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book|first=Nick|last=Montfort | title=Twisty Little Passages: An Approach to Interactive Fiction | year=2005 | publisher=[[The MIT Press]] | isbn=978-0-262-63318-5}}\n* Keller, Daniel. \"Reading and playing: what makes interactive fiction unique\"  p.&nbsp;276-298. in Williams, J.

Worldwide, there are ice hockey federations in 76 countries.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=IIHF |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/ |title=The world governing body |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Canada, the United States, Nordic countries, and some other European countries the sport is known simply as '''hockey'''; the name \"ice hockey\" is used in places where \"hockey\" more often refers to the more popular [[field hockey]], such as countries in [[South America]], [[Asia]], [[Ice hockey in Africa|Africa]], [[Australasia]], and some European countries including the [[Sport in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Sport in Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Sport in the Netherlands|Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Koninklijke Nederlandse Hockey Bond |url=https://hockey.nl/de-sport/organisatie/koninklijke-nederlandse-hockey-bond/ |accessdate=October 20, 2018 |agency=Hockey.nl}}</ref>\n\nIce hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th century United Kingdom and elsewhere. These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules as they were developed, such as \"[[shinny]]\" and \"ice polo\". The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in [[Montreal]], where the [[first indoor hockey game]] was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and [[professional ice hockey]] originated around 1900. The [[Stanley Cup]], emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL. In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace, the precursor of the IIHF and the sport was played for the first time in the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]] in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIn international competitions, the national teams of six countries (the \"[[Big Six (ice hockey)|Big Six]]\") predominate: [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]], [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] and [[United States men's national ice hockey team|the United States]]. Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in men's competition at the Olympics, only six medals were not awarded to one of those countries (or two of their precursors, the Soviet Union for Russia, and Czechoslovakia for the Czech Republic). In the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations. Teams outside the \"Big Six\" have won only five medals in either competition since 1953.<ref>Including former incarnations of them, such as [[Czechoslovakia]] or the [[Soviet Union]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/men.html |title=IIHF World Championships: All Medalists: Men |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> The [[World Cup of Hockey]] is organized by the National Hockey League and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA), unlike the annual World Ice Hockey Championships and quadrennial Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).

[[IJscolf]], a game resembling [[Kolven|colf]] on an ice-covered surface, was popular in the [[Low Countries]] between the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Dutch Golden Age]]. It was played with a wooden curved bat (called a ''colf'' or ''kolf''), a wooden or leather ball and two poles (or nearby landmarks), with the objective to hit the chosen point using the least number of strokes. A similar game (''[[knattleikr]]'') had been played for a thousand years or more by the [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavian]] peoples, as documented in the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic sagas]].

In 1825, [[John Franklin]] wrote \"The game of hockey played on the ice was the morning sport\" on [[Great Bear Lake]] during one of his [[Arctic]] expeditions. A mid-1830s watercolour portrays New Brunswick lieutenant-governor Archibald Campbell and his family with British soldiers on skates playing a stick-on-ice sport. Captain R.G.A. Levinge, a British Army officer in New Brunswick during Campbell's time, wrote about \"hockey on ice\" on Chippewa Creek (a tributary of the Niagara River) in 1839.

By 1902, the [[Western Pennsylvania Hockey League]] was the first to employ professionals. The league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the first fully professional league\u2014the [[International Professional Hockey League]] (IPHL)\u2014in 1904. The WPHL and IPHL hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players (who played with [[amateur sports|amateurs]]). The IPHL, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada (with leagues in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).\n\nIn 1910, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) was formed in Montreal. The NHA would further refine the rules: dropping the rover position, dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the National Hockey League in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.\n\nProfessional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, but amateur leagues leading to national championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss [[National League A]], founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], the [[Czech Extraliga]], the Finnish [[Liiga]] and the [[Swedish Hockey League]].\n\n==Game==\n[[File:Staples Center panoramic.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.75|Panoramic view of a [[Los Angeles Kings]] ice Hockey game at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California.]] [[File:Icehockeylayout.svg|thumb|Typical layout of an ice hockey rink surface]]\n\nWhile the general characteristics of the game stay the same wherever it is played, the exact rules depend on the particular [[Ice hockey rules|code of play]] being used. The two most important codes are those of the IIHF<ref>{{cite book |last=International Ice Hockey Federation |authorlink=International Ice Hockey Federation |title=Official Rule Book 2002\u20132006 |date=September 2002 |url=http://www.iihf.com/pdfRules/IIHFRuleBookeng.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319080459/http://www.iihf.com/pdfRules/IIHFRuleBookeng.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2006}}</ref> and the NHL.<ref>{{cite book |last=National Hockey League |authorlink=National Hockey League |title=Official Rules 2006\u201307 |publisher=Triumph Books |year=2006 |location=Chicago |url=http://cdn.nhl.com/rules/20062007rulebook.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090303204304/http://cdn.nhl.com/rules/20062007rulebook.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 3, 2009 |isbn=1-894801-03-2 |format=PDF |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Both of the codes, and others, originated from Canadian rules of ice hockey of the early 20th Century.\n\nIce hockey is played on a ''[[hockey rink]]''. During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The objective of the game is to score ''[[goal (ice hockey)|goals]]'' by shooting a hard [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] rubber disc, the ''[[hockey puck|puck]]'', into the opponent's goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck.\n\nWithin certain restrictions, players may redirect the puck with any part of their body. Players may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates, unless they are in the defensive zone. Players are also prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponent's goal, though unintentional redirections off the skate are permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.\n\nHockey is an \"[[Offside (ice hockey)|off-side]]\" game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules favoured individual stick-handling as a key means of driving the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a truly team sport, where individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.{{sfn|Dryden |2005 |p=246}}\n\nThe six players on each team are typically divided into three forwards, two defencemen, and a goaltender. The term ''skaters'' is typically used to describe all players who are not goaltenders. The ''[[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]'' positions consist of a ''[[Center (ice hockey)|centre]]'' and two ''[[Winger (ice hockey)|wingers]]'': a ''left wing'' and a ''right wing''. Forwards often play together as units or ''lines'', with the same three forwards always playing together. The ''[[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]]'' usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned as such, based on the side on which they carry their stick. A substitution of an entire unit at once is called a ''line change''. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when ''[[shorthanded]]'' or on a ''[[Power play (sporting term)|power play]]''. The goaltender stands in a, usually blue, semi-circle called the ''crease'' in the defensive zone keeping pucks from going in. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing ''on the fly''. A new NHL rule added in the 2005\u201306 season prevents a team from changing their line after they ''[[Icing (ice hockey)|ice]]'' the puck.\n\nThe boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play and they can also be used as tools to play the puck. Players are permitted to \"[[bodycheck]]\" opponents into the boards as a means of stopping progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are \"in play\" and do not cause a stoppage of the game when the puck or players are influenced (by either bouncing or colliding) into them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a \"[[faceoff]]\". Two players \"face\" each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck. Markings (circles) on the ice indicate the locations for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.\n\nThe three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: \"offside\", \"icing\", and the puck going out of play. A player is \"offside\" if he enters his [[Hockey rink#Zones|opponent's zone]] before the puck itself. Under many situations, a player may not \"ice the puck\", shoot the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponent's goal line. The puck goes \"out of play\" whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink (onto the player benches, over the \"glass,\" or onto the protective netting above the glass) and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles. It also does not matter if the puck comes back onto the ice surface from those areas as the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink.\n\nUnder IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18, plus two goaltenders. In the NHL, the players are usually divided into four lines of three forwards, and into three pairs of defencemen. On occasion, teams may elect to substitute an extra defenceman for a forward. The seventh defenceman may play as a substitute defenceman, spend the game on the bench, or if a team chooses to play four lines then this seventh defenceman may see ice-time on the [[fourth line]] as a forward.\n\n===Periods and overtime===\nA professional game consists of three \"periods\" of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime. Recreational leagues and children's leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.\n\nVarious procedures are used if a tie occurs. In tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour ''sudden death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]]'', in which the teams continue to play twenty-minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999\u20132000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period with five players (plus a goalie) per side, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none (just as if they had lost in regulation).\n\nFrom 1999\u20132000 until 2003\u201304, the National Hockey League decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having four skaters per side (plus the goalie) to \"open up\" the game. In the event of a tie, each team would still receive one point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded two points in the standings and the losing team one point. The idea was to discourage teams from playing for a tie, since previously some teams might have preferred a tie and 1 point to risking a loss and zero points. The only exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon (an \"empty net\" goal), in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss. Since the 2015\u201316 season, the single five-minute sudden death overtime session involves three skaters on each side. Since three skaters must always be on the ice in an NHL game, the consequences of penalties are slightly different from those during regulation play. If a team is on a powerplay when overtime begins, that team will play with more than three skaters (usually four, very rarely five) until the expiration of the penalty. Any penalty during overtime that would result in a team losing a skater during regulation instead causes the non-penalized team to add a skater. Once the penalized team's penalty ends, the number of skaters on each side is adjusted accordingly, with the penalized team adding a skater in regulation and the non-penalized team subtracting a skater in overtime. This goes until the next stoppage of play.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2015-2016-Interactive-rulebook.pdf |title=National Hockey League Official Rules 2015\u20132016 |publisher=National Hockey League |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nInternational play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL (in the regular season), now use an overtime period identical to that from 99\u201300 \u2013 03\u201304 followed by a [[Shootout (hockey)|penalty shootout]]. If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking penalty shots. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to a ''[[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]'' format. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided in overtime or by a shootout the winning team is awarded two points in the standings and the losing team is awarded one point. Ties no longer occur in the NHL.\n\nThe overtime mode for the NHL playoffs differ from the regular season. In the playoffs there are no shootouts nor ties. If a game is tied after regulation an additional 20 minutes of 5 on 5 sudden death overtime will be added. In case of a tied game after the overtime, multiple 20-minute overtimes will be played until a team scores, which wins the match.\n\n===Penalties===\n{{Main|Penalty (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Hockeyfight.JPG|thumb|upright|Altercations often occur near the goal after a stoppage of play, since defensive players are highly concerned with protecting their [[goaltender]].]]\n\nIn ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to play stoppages whereby the play is restarted at a face off. Some infractions result in the imposition of a ''penalty'' to a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the \"[[penalty box]]\" and their team has to play with one less player on the ice for a designated amount of time. ''Minor'' penalties last for two minutes, ''major'' penalties last for five minutes, and a ''double minor'' penalty is two ''consecutive'' penalties of two minutes duration. A single minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. Players may be also assessed personal extended penalties or game expulsions for misconduct in addition to the penalty or penalties their team must serve. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing \"short-handed\" while the opposing team is on a \"[[power play (sport)|power play]]\".\n\nA two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as \"[[tripping (ice hockey)|tripping]]\", \"[[elbow (strike)|elbowing]]\", \"[[roughing]]\", \"[[high-sticking]]\", \"[[delay of game|delay of the game]]\", \"[[too many men|too many players on the ice]]\", \"[[boarding (ice hockey)|boarding]]\", illegal equipment, \"[[charging (ice hockey)|charging]]\" (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), \"holding\", holding the stick (grabbing an opponent's stick), \"interference\", \"[[hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]]\", \"[[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]]\", \"kneeing\", \"unsportsmanlike conduct\" (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), \"butt-ending\" (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick\u2014a very rare penalty), \"spearing\", or \"[[cross-checking]]\". As of the 2005\u20132006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for \"[[diving (ice hockey)|diving]]\", where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a \"minor\" penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. Major penalties assessed for fighting are typically offsetting, meaning neither team is short-handed and the players exit the penalty box upon a stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. The foul of \"boarding\" (defined as \"check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |title=NHL Rulebook |publisher=nhlofficials.com |access-date=October 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025043505/http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.\n\nSome varieties of penalties do not always require the offending team to play a man short. Concurrent five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, both the players serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have a full complement of players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In this case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one penalty expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play for the remainder of the time); this applies regardless of current pending penalties. However, in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Thus, ten-minute ''misconduct'' penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice ''unless'' a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a ''two-and-ten'' or ''five-and-ten''). In this case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, ''game misconducts'' are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials' discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if an additional minor or major penalty is assessed, a designated player must serve out of that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned \"two-and-ten\"). In some rare cases, a player may receive up to nineteen minutes in penalties for one string of plays. This could involve receiving a four-minute double minor penalty, getting in a fight with an opposing player who retaliates, and then receiving a game misconduct after the fight. In this case, the player is ejected and two teammates must serve the double-minor and major penalties.\n\nA \"[[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]\" is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a \"[[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]]\". A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.\n\n[[File:Referee hockey ahl 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.]]\nOfficials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one's hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one's defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).\n\nIn the NHL, a unique penalty applies to the goalies. The goalies now are forbidden to play the puck in the \"corners\" of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalie's team. Only in the area in-front of the goal line and immediately behind the net (marked by two red lines on either side of the net) the goalie can play the puck.\n\nAn additional rule that has never been a penalty, but was an infraction in the NHL before recent rules changes, is the \"[[Two-line pass|two-line offside pass]]\". Prior to the 2005\u201306 NHL season, play was stopped when a pass from inside a team's defending zone crossed the centre line, with a face-off held in the defending zone of the offending team. Now, the centre line is no longer used in the NHL to determine a two-line pass infraction, a change that the IIHF had adopted in 1998. Players are now able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.\n\nThe NHL has taken steps to speed up the game of hockey and create a game of finesse, by retreating from the past when illegal hits, fights, and \"clutching and grabbing\" among players were commonplace. Rules are now more strictly enforced, resulting in more penalties, which in turn provides more protection to the players and facilitates more goals being scored. The governing body for United States' amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number of stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game (\"zero tolerance\").\n\nIn men's hockey, but not in women's, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. This use of the hip and shoulder is called \"[[Checking (ice hockey)|body checking]]\". Not all physical contact is legal\u2014in particular, hits from behind, hits to the head and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.\n\nA ''delayed penalty call'' occurs when a penalty offence is committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal. In these cases, the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on. However, it is possible for the controlling team to mishandle the puck into their own net. If a delayed penalty is signalled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player, but not served. In 2012, this rule was changed by the United States' [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) for [[college ice hockey|college level hockey]]. In college games, the penalty is still enforced even if the team in possession scores.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2012\u20132013 and 2013\u20132014 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH14.pdf |page=HR\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===Officials===\n{{Main|Official (ice hockey)}}\nA typical game of hockey is governed by two to four ''[[Official (ice hockey)|officials]]'' on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two ''linesmen'' who are mainly responsible for calling \"offside\" and \"[[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]]\" violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201353}}</ref> and one or two ''referees'',<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201352}}</ref> who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201354}}</ref> The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.\n\nThe most widespread system in use today is the \"three-man system,\" that uses one referee and two linesmen. Another less commonly used system is the two referee and one linesman system. This system is very close to the regular three-man system except for a few procedure changes. With the first being the National Hockey League, a number of leagues have started to implement the \"four-official system,\" where an additional referee is added to aid in the calling of penalties normally difficult to assess by one single referee. The system is now used in every NHL game, at [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]], the [[Olympics]] and in many professional and high-level amateur leagues in North America and Europe.\n\nOfficials are selected by the league they work for. Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies [[Hockey Canada]] and [[USA Hockey]] approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests. Hockey Canada has officiating levels I through VI.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hockey Canada Officiating Department |title=How to Get Started \u2013 Officials |url=http://hockeycanada.com/index.php/ci_id/63557/la_id/1.htm}}</ref> USA Hockey has officiating levels 1 through 4.<ref>{{cite web |author=USA Hockey Officiating Program |title=USA Hockey officials registration program |url=http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512093248/http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Equipment===\n[[File:Wallinheimo Sinuhe JYP.jpg|thumb|left|Goaltenders use more protective equipment than other players, just like goaltender [[Sinuhe Wallinheimo]] pictured here.]]\n\n{{Main|Ice hockey equipment}}\nSince men's ice hockey is a full contact sport, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet (cage worn if certain age or clear plastic visor can be worn), shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector.\n \n[[Ice hockey goaltending equipment|Goaltenders]] use different equipment. With hockey pucks approaching them at speeds of up to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialized goalie skates (these skates are built more for movement side to side rather than forwards and backwards), a jock or jill, large leg pads (there are size restrictions in certain leagues), blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey. Goaltenders' equipment has continually become larger and larger, leading to fewer goals in each game and many official rule changes.\n \nHockey skates are optimized for physical acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, and changes in skating direction. In addition, they must be rigid and tough to protect the skater's feet from contact with other skaters, sticks, pucks, the boards, and the ice itself. Rigidity also improves the overall manoeuvrability of the skate. Blade length, thickness (width), and curvature (rocker/radius (front to back) and radius of hollow (across the blade width) are quite different from speed or figure skates. Hockey players usually adjust these parameters based on their skill level, position, and body type. The blade width of most skates are about {{convert|1/8|in|mm}} thick.\n \nThe hockey stick consists of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has a big impact on its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for the right balanced flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong \"whip-back\" which sends the puck flying at high speeds. It is quite distinct from sticks in other sports games and most suited to hitting and controlling the flat puck. Its unique shape contributed to the early development of the game.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Injury==\n{{Cleanup|reason=\"Both sections are closely related\"|date=January 2016}}\nIce hockey is a full contact sport and carries a high risk of injury. Players are moving at speeds around approximately {{convert|20|\u2013|30|mph|-1|abbr=on}} and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulders, hips, and hockey pucks all contribute. The types of injuries associated with hockey include: lacerations, concussions, contusions, ligament tears, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains. Women's ice hockey players can have contact but are not allowed to body check.\n\nCompared to athletes who play other sports, ice hockey players are at higher risk of [[overuse injuries]] and injuries caused by [[early sports specialization]] by teenagers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feeley |first=Brian T. |last2=Agel |first2=Julie |last3=LaPrade |first3=Robert F. |date=January 2016 |title=When Is It Too Early for Single Sport Specialization? |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=234\u2013241 |doi=10.1177/0363546515576899 |issn=1552-3365 |pmid=25825379}}</ref>\n\n===Head injuries===\nAccording to the Hughston Health Alert, \"Lacerations to the head, scalp, and face are the most frequent types of injury [in hockey].\"<ref name=\"hughston.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822231059/http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |title=Ice Hockey Injuries |publisher=Hughston Clinic}}</ref> Even a shallow cut to the head results in a loss of a large amount of blood. Not only are lacerations common, \"it is estimated that direct trauma accounts for 80% of all [hockey] injuries. Most of these injuries are caused by player contact, falls and contact with a puck, high stick and occasionally, a skate blade.\"<ref name=\"hughston.com\"/> One of the causes of head injury is checking from behind. Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind, many leagues, including the NHL have made this a major and game misconduct penalty (called \"boarding\"). Another type of check that accounts for many of the player-to-player contact concussions is a check to the head resulting in a misconduct penalty (called \"head contact\"). A check to the head can be defined as delivering a hit while the receiving player's head is down and their waist is bent and the aggressor is targeting the opponent player's head. The most dangerous result of a head injury in hockey can be classified as a concussion. Most concussions occur during player-to-player contact rather than when a player is checked into the boards. Checks to the head have accounted for nearly 50% of concussions that players in the National Hockey League have suffered. Concussions that players suffer may go unreported because there is no obvious physical signs if a player is not knocked unconscious. This can prove to be dangerous if a player decides to return to play without receiving proper medical attention. Studies show that, ice hockey causes 44.3% of all traumatic brain injuries among Canadian children.<ref>Cusimano, MD. Medical News Today. MediLexicon International, n.d. Web. March 4, 2015.</ref> In severe cases, the traumatic brain injuries are capable of resulting in death. Occurrences of death from these injuries are rare, but occur all too much in a variety of sports.\n\n==Tactics==\n[[File:OHL-Hockey-Plymouth-Whalers-vs-Saginaw-Spirit.jpg|left|thumb|Winning the [[faceoff]] can be the key to some strategies. A game between [[Saginaw]] and [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]'s [[Ontario Hockey League]] teams.]]\n\n===Checking===\n{{main|Checking (ice hockey)}}\nAn important defensive tactic is checking\u2014attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. ''Stick checking'', ''sweep checking'', and ''poke checking'' are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck. The ''[[neutral zone trap]]'' is designed to isolate the puck carrier in the neutral zone preventing him from entering the offensive zone. ''Body checking'' is using one's shoulder or hip to strike an opponent who has the puck or who is the last to have touched it (the last person to have touched the puck is still legally \"in possession\" of it, although a penalty is generally called if he is checked more than two seconds after his last touch). Often the term checking is used to refer to body checking, with its true definition generally only propagated among fans of the game.\n\n===Offensive tactics===\n[[File:Peter Bondra scoring.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Bondra]] of the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] [[Shot (hockey)|shoots the puck]] and scores against [[Roberto Luongo]] of the [[Florida Panthers]] during the [[2005\u201306 NHL season]]]]\n{{main|Shot (ice hockey)|Slapshot|Wrist shot|Snap shot (ice hockey)|Backhand slapshot|Offside (ice hockey)|Extra attacker|Deke (ice hockey)}}\n\nOffensive tactics include improving a team's position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one's zone towards the opponent's zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent's blue line. [[National Hockey League rules|NHL rules]] instated for the 2006 season redefined the offside rule to make the two-line pass legal; a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line, past both that blue line and the centre red line, to a player on the near side of the opponents' blue line. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent's goal, he or she is said to \"shoot\" the puck.\n\nA ''deflection'' is a shot that redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal. A ''[[one-timer]]'' is a shot struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions. ''Headmanning the puck'', also known as  ''breaking out'', is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice. ''[[Loafing (ice hockey)|Loafing]]'', also known as ''[[cherry picking (basketball)|cherry-picking]]'', is when a player, usually a forward, skates behind an attacking team, instead of playing defence, in an attempt to create an easy scoring chance.\n\nA team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to ''pull the goalie''; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an ''[[extra attacker]]'' on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.\n\nOne of the most important strategies for a team is their ''[[forecheck]]''. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking is an important part of the ''[[dump and chase]]'' strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: [[2-1-2 Forecheck|2\u20131\u20132]], 1\u20132\u20132, and 1\u20134. The 2\u20131\u20132 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1\u20132\u20132 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1\u20134 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the [[left wing lock]], which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.\n\nThere are many other little tactics used in the game of hockey. ''[[Cycling (ice hockey)|Cycling]]'' moves the puck along the boards in the offensive zone to create a [[scoring chance]] by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. ''Pinching'' is when a defenceman pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A ''[[saucer pass]]'' is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.\n\nA [[deke (ice hockey)|deke]], short for \"decoy,\" is a [[feint]] with the body or stick to fool a defender or the goalie. Many modern players, such as [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Patrick Kane]], have picked up the skill of \"dangling,\" which is fancier deking and requires more stick handling skills.\n\n===Fights===\n{{Main|Fighting in ice hockey}}\nAlthough fighting is officially prohibited in the rules, it is not an uncommon occurrence at the professional level, and its prevalence has been both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned. [[enforcer (ice hockey)|Enforcers]] and other players fight to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. A fight will also break out if one of the team's skilled players gets hit hard or someone gets hit by what the team perceives as a dirty hit. The amateur game penalizes fisticuffs more harshly, as a player who receives a fighting major is also assessed at least a 10-minute misconduct penalty (NCAA and some Junior leagues) or a game misconduct penalty and [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] (high school and younger, as well as some casual adult leagues).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |title=KAHC Suspended Players |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813154239/http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |archivedate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> Crowds seem to like fighting in ice hockey and cheer when fighting erupts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/2009/03/17/hockey_fans_love_fighting_survey_says.html |title=Hockey fans love fighting, survey says |work=Toronto Star |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Women's ice hockey==\n[[File:A Dream of the Future (Women's Ice Hockey).png|thumb|upright|Drawing of a female ice hockey player, from ''[[Hockey: Canada's Royal Winter Game]]'' (1899)]]\n[[File:Engelberg-1914.jpg|thumb|Men and women playing hockey in Switzerland 1914]]\n[[File:Karikatur-1941.jpg|thumb|Misogynic cartoon from the Nazi period in Germany 1941]]\nIce hockey is one of the fastest growing women's sports in the world, with the number of participants increasing by 400 percent from 1995 to 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Industry Canada |url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |accessdate=December 4, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927042219/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |archivedate=September 27, 2004}}</ref> In 2011, Canada had 85,827 women players,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/canada.html |title=IIHF About Hockey Canada |publisher=Iihf.com |date=April 26, 1920 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> United States had 65,609,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/united-states.html |title=IIHF About United States |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Finland 4,760,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/finland.html |title=IIHF About Finland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=February 10, 1928 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Sweden 3,075<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/sweden.html |title=IIHF About Sweden |publisher=Iihf.com |date=March 23, 1912 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> and Switzerland 1,172.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/switzerland.html |title=IIHF About Switzerland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=November 23, 1908 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> While there are not as many organized leagues for women as there are for men, there exist leagues of all levels, including the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] (CWHL), [[Western Women's Hockey League]], [[National Women's Hockey League]] (NWHL), [[Mid-Atlantic Women's Hockey League]], and various European leagues; as well as university teams, national and Olympic teams, and [[recreation]]al teams.

Several games were recorded in the 1890s in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The women of Lord Stanley's family were known to participate in the game of ice hockey on the outdoor ice rink at [[Rideau Hall]], the residence of Canada's Governor-General.\n\nThe game developed at first without an organizing body. A tournament in 1902 between Montreal and Trois-Rivieres was billed as the first championship tournament. Several tournaments, such as at the Banff Winter Carnival, were held in the early 20th Century and numerous women's teams such as the Seattle Vamps and Vancouver Amazons existed. Organizations started to develop in the 1920s, such as the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association, and later, the Dominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association. Starting in the 1960s, the game spread to universities. Today, the sport is played from youth through adult leagues, and in the universities of North America and internationally. There are two major women's hockey leagues, the National Women's Hockey League with teams in the Northeastern United States which is a professional league and the Canadian Women's Hockey League with teams in Canada and the United States, which is semi-professional and is developing toward becoming a fully professional league.\n\nThe first women's world championship tournament, albeit unofficial, was held in 1987 in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. This was followed by the [[IIHF World Women's Championships|first IIHF World Championship in 1990]] in Ottawa. Women's ice hockey was added as a medal sport at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano, Japan]].

The league's history began after Canada's [[National Hockey Association]] decided to disband in 1917; the result was the creation of the National Hockey League. The league expanded to the United States beginning in 1924. In 1967, the NHL doubled in size to 12 teams, undertaking one of the greatest expansions in professional sports history. A few years later, in 1972, a new 12 team league, the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) was formed and due to its ensuing rivalry with the NHL, it caused an escalation in players salaries. As of 1979, the NHL had grown to 17 teams and merged with the WHA. This created a 21 team league.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/sports/ice-hockey |title=Britannica |last=Fischler |first=Shirley |date= |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref> By 2017, the NHL had expanded to 31 teams, and after a realignment in 2013, these teams were divided into two conferences and four divisions.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Hockey-League |title=National Hockey League (NHL) |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n====Minor leagues====\nThe [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), sometimes referred to as \"The A,\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |title=Five AHL players to watch the rest of the season |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517024932/http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |archive-date=May 17, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is the primary developmental professional league for players aspiring to enter the NHL. It comprises 30 teams from the United States and Canada, and will expand to 31 teams for the 2018\u201319 season. It is run as a \"[[Farm team|farm league]]\" to the NHL, with the vast majority of AHL players under contract to an NHL team. The [[ECHL]] (called the East Coast Hockey League before the 2003\u201304 season) is a mid-level minor league in the United States with a few players under contract to NHL or AHL teams. The [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL) is a developmental minor league in the United States with no NHL affiliations. Most undrafted players get their start in the ECHL or SPHL.\n\n====University competitions====\nIn the United States especially, [[college hockey]] is popular and the best university teams compete in the annual [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]]. The [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] is composed of college teams at the club level.\n\n====Junior leagues====\nIn Canada, the [[Canadian Hockey League]] is an umbrella organization comprising three major junior leagues: the [[Ontario Hockey League]], the [[Western Hockey League]], and the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. It attracts players from Canada, the United States and Europe.\nIn the United States, the [[United States Hockey League]] (USHL) is the highest junior league. Players in this league are strictly amateur, so that they may play college hockey if they wish.\n\n===Eurasia===\n[[File:HC LEV Record O2.jpg|thumb|[[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]] match]]\n\n====Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)====\nThe Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the largest and most popular ice hockey league in [[Eurasia]]. The league is the direct successor to the [[Russian Super League]], which in turn was the successor to the [[Soviet Championship League|Soviet League]], the history of which dates back to the Soviet adoption of ice hockey in the 1940s. The KHL was [[2008\u201309 KHL season|launched in 2008]] with clubs predominantly from Russia, but featuring teams from other [[post-Soviet states]]. The league expanded beyond the former Soviet countries beginning in the [[2011\u201312 KHL season|2011\u201312 season]], with clubs in Croatia and Slovakia. The number of teams has since increased to 28 from eight different countries.\n\n====Minor leagues====\nThe second division of hockey in Eurasia is the [[Supreme Hockey League]] (VHL). This league features 24 teams from Russia and 2 from Kazakhstan. This league is currently being converted to a farm league for the KHL, similarly to the AHL's function in relation to the NHL. The third division is the [[Russian Hockey League]], which features only teams from Russia. The [[Asia League Ice Hockey|Asia League]], an international ice hockey league featuring clubs from China, Japan, South Korea, and the Russian Far East, is the successor to the [[Japan Ice Hockey League]].\n\n====Junior leagues====\nThe highest junior league in Eurasia is the [[Junior Hockey League (Russia)|Junior Hockey League]] (MHL). It features 32 teams from post-Soviet states, predominantly Russia. The second tier to this league is the [[Junior Hockey League Championships]] (MHL-B).\n\n===Europe===\nSeveral countries in Europe have their own top professional senior leagues. Many future KHL and NHL players start or end their professional careers in these leagues. The [[National League A]] in Switzerland, [[Swedish Hockey League]] in Sweden, [[Liiga]] in Finland, and [[Czech Extraliga]] in the Czech Republic are all very popular in their respective countries.\n\n====Champions Hockey League====\nBeginning in the 2014\u201315 season, the [[Champions Hockey League]] was launched, a league consisting of first-tier teams from several European countries, running parallel to the teams' domestic leagues. The competition is meant to serve as a Europe-wide ice hockey club championship. The competition is a direct successor to the [[European Trophy]] and is related to the 2008\u201309 [[Champions Hockey League (2008\u201309)|tournament of the same name]].\n\n====Other====\nThere are also several annual tournaments for clubs, held outside of league play. [[Season (sports)|Pre-season]] tournaments include the [[European Trophy]], [[Tampere Cup]] and the [[Pajulahti Cup]]. One of the oldest international ice hockey competition for clubs is the [[Spengler Cup]], held every year in [[Davos]], Switzerland, between Christmas and New Year's Day. It was first awarded in 1923 to the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. The [[Memorial Cup]], a competition for junior-level (age 20 and under) clubs is held annually from a pool of junior championship teams in Canada and the United States.\n\nInternational club competitions organized by the IIHF include the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]], the [[Victoria Cup (ice hockey)|Victoria Cup]] and the European Women's Champions Cup. The [[World Junior Club Cup]] is an annual tournament of [[junior ice hockey]] clubs representing each of the top junior leagues.\n\n===National team competitions===\n[[File:Finlande Russie.jpg|thumb|Finland vs Russia in the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics 2006 in Turin]].]]\n\n[[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Ice hockey]] has been played at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] since 1924 (and was played at the [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|summer games in 1920]]). Hockey is Canada's national winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The [[Soviet Union|USSR]] won all but two gold medals from [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] to [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]].  The United States won their first gold medal in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]]. On the way to winning the gold medal at the [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980 Lake Placid Olympics]] amateur US college players defeated the heavily favoured Soviet squad\u2014an event known as the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" in the United States. Restrictions on professional players were fully dropped at the 1988 games in Calgary. NHL agreed to participate ten years later. 1998 Games saw the full participation of players from the NHL, which suspended operations during the Games and has done so in subsequent Games. The [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games in Vancouver]] were the first played in an NHL city since the inclusion of NHL players. The 2010 games were the first played on NHL-sized ice rinks, which are narrower than the IIHF standard.\n\n[[File:Eroeffnungsspiel eishockey wm 2010.jpg|thumb|[[2010 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|Ice Hockey World Championships 2010]] in Germany]]\nNational teams representing the member federations of the IIHF compete annually in the IIHF [[Ice Hockey World Championships]]. Teams are selected from the available players by the individual federations, without restriction on amateur or professional status. Since it is held in the spring, the tournament coincides with the annual NHL [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] and many of the top players are hence not available to participate in the tournament. Many of the NHL players who do play in the IIHF tournament come from teams eliminated before the playoffs or in the first round, and federations often hold open spots until the tournament to allow for players to join the tournament after their club team is eliminated. For many years, the tournament was an amateur-only tournament, but this restriction was removed, beginning in 1977.\n\nThe [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] and [[1974 Summit Series]], two series pitting the best Canadian and [[Soviet]] players without IIHF restrictions were major successes, and established a rivalry between Canada and the USSR. In the spirit of best-versus-best without restrictions on amateur or professional status, the series were followed by five [[Canada Cup (ice hockey)|Canada Cup]] tournaments, played in North America. Two NHL versus USSR series were also held: the 1979 Challenge Cup and [[Rendez-vous '87]]. The Canada Cup tournament later became the [[World Cup of Hockey]], played in 1996, 2004 and 2016. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004 and 2016.\n\nSince the initial women's world championships in 1990, there have been fifteen tournaments.<ref name=\"IIHF WWC list\" /> Women's hockey has been played at the Olympics since 1998.<ref name=\"Hunter 1998 Olympics\" /> The [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympic final]] between Canada and Sweden marked the only time the women's world championship or Olympic final did not involve both Canada and the United States.\n\nOther ice hockey tournaments featuring national teams include the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World U20 Championship]], the [[IIHF World U18 Championships|World U18 Championships]], the [[World U-17 Hockey Challenge]], the [[World Junior A Challenge]], the [[Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament]], the [[IIHF World Women's U18 Championships|World Women's U18 Championships]] and the [[4 Nations Cup]]. The annual [[Euro Hockey Tour]], an unofficial European championship between the national men's teams of the [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]] and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] have been played since 1996\u201397.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n====Oceania====\nThe [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] and [[New Zealand Ice Hockey League]] are represented by nine and five teams respectively. As of 2012, the two top teams of the previous season from each league compete in the [[Trans-Tasman Champions League]].\n\n====Africa====\n[[Ice hockey in Africa]] is a small but growing sport; while no African ice hockey playing nation has a domestic league, there are several regional leagues in [[South Africa]].\n\n====Pond hockey====\n{{Main|Pond hockey}}\nPond hockey is a form of ice hockey played generally as pick-up hockey on lakes, ponds and artificial outdoor rinks during the winter. Pond hockey is commonly referred to in hockey circles as shinny. Its rules differ from traditional hockey because there is no hitting and very little shooting, placing a greater emphasis on skating, puckhandling and passing abilities. Since 2002, the [[World Pond Hockey Championship]] has been played on Roulston Lake in [[Plaster Rock]], New Brunswick, Canada.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the World Pond Hockey Championship |url=http://worldpondhockey.ca/en/home/history |website=worldpondhockey.ca |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Since 2006, the [[US Pond Hockey Championships]] have been played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the [[Canadian National Pond Hockey Championships]] have been played in Huntsville, Ontario.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Ice hockey in popular culture}}\nIce hockey is the [[Sports in Canada#Official sports|official winter sport of Canada]].

"text/x-wiki", "text": "In computer science, an '''integer''' is a [[data|datum]] of '''integral data type''', a [[data type]] that represents some [[interval (mathematics)|range of mathematical integers]]. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including [[virtual machine]]s, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor [[word size|register]] or memory address as an integer.\n\n== Value and representation ==\nThe ''value'' of an item with an integral type is the mathematical integer that it corresponds to. Integral types may be ''unsigned'' (capable of representing only non-negative integers) or ''signed'' (capable of representing negative integers as well).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/BinaryMath/NumSys.html |title=Representation of numbers |last=Cheever |first=Eric |publisher=Swarthmore College |accessdate=2011-09-11}}</ref>\n\nAn integer value is typically specified in the [[source code]] of a program as a sequence of digits optionally prefixed with + or \u2212. Some programming languages allow other notations, such as hexadecimal (base 16) or octal (base 8). Some programming languages also permit [[digit group separator]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Madhusudhan Konda |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/09/java7-features.html |title=A look at Java 7's new features - O'Reilly Radar |publisher=Radar.oreilly.com |date=2011-09-02 |accessdate=2013-10-15}}</ref>\n\nThe ''internal representation'' of this datum is the way the value is stored in the computer's memory. Unlike mathematical integers, a typical datum in a computer has some minimal and maximum possible value.\n\nThe most common representation of a positive integer is a string of [[bit]]s, using the [[binary numeral system]]. The order of the memory [[byte]]s storing the bits varies; see [[endianness]]. The ''width'' or ''precision'' of an integral type is the number of bits in its representation. An integral type with ''n'' bits can encode 2<sup>''n''</sup> numbers; for example an unsigned type typically represents the non-negative values 0 through 2<sup>''n''</sup>\u22121. Other encodings of integer values to bit patterns are sometimes used, for example [[binary-coded decimal]] or [[Gray code]], or as printed character codes such as [[ASCII]].\n\nThere are four well-known [[signed number representations|ways to represent signed numbers]] in a binary computing system. The most common is [[two's complement]], which allows a signed integral type with ''n'' bits to represent numbers from \u22122<sup>(''n''\u22121)</sup> through 2<sup>(''n''\u22121)</sup>\u22121. Two's complement arithmetic is convenient because there is a perfect [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] between representations and values (in particular, no separate +0 and \u22120), and because [[addition]], [[subtraction]] and [[multiplication]] do not need to distinguish between signed and unsigned types. Other possibilities include [[offset binary]], [[sign-magnitude]], and [[ones' complement]].\n\nSome computer languages define integer sizes in a machine-independent way; others have varying definitions depending on the underlying processor word size. Not all language implementations define variables of all integer sizes, and defined sizes may not even be distinct in a particular implementation. An integer in one [[programming language]] may be a different size in a different language or on a different processor.\n\n== Common integral data types ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Bits\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Range (assuming [[two's complement]] for [[Signed number representations|signed]])\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Decimal digits\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Uses\n!scope=col colspan=\"5\" | Implementations\n|-\n!

Typically, hardware will support both signed and unsigned types, but only a small, fixed set of widths.\n\nThe table above lists integral type widths that are supported in hardware by common processors. High level programming languages provide more possibilities. It is common to have a 'double width' integral type that has twice as many bits as the biggest hardware-supported type. Many languages also have ''bit-field'' types (a specified number of bits, usually constrained to be less than the maximum hardware-supported width) and ''range'' types (that can represent only the integers in a specified range).\n\nSome languages, such as [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]], [[Smalltalk]], [[REXX]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Perl 6]] support ''arbitrary precision'' integers (also known as ''infinite precision integers'' or ''[[bignum]]s''). Other languages that do not support this concept as a top-level construct may have libraries available to represent very large numbers using arrays of smaller variables, such as Java's <tt>BigInteger</tt> class or [[Perl 5]]'s \"<tt>bigint</tt>\" package.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html |title=BigInteger (Java Platform SE 6) |publisher=Oracle |accessdate=2011-09-11 }}</ref> These use as much of the computer's memory as is necessary to store the numbers; however, a computer has only a finite amount of storage, so they too can only represent a finite subset of the mathematical integers. These schemes support very large numbers, for example one kilobyte of memory could be used to store numbers up to 2466 decimal digits long.\n\nA [[Boolean datatype|Boolean]] or [[Flag (computing)|Flag]] type is a type that can represent only two values: 0 and 1, usually identified with ''false'' and ''true'' respectively. <!-- Pascal has them the other way around --> This type can be stored in memory using a single bit, but is often given a full byte for convenience of addressing and speed of access.\n\nA four-bit quantity is known as a ''[[nibble]]'' (when eating, being smaller than a ''bite'') or ''nybble'' (being a pun on the form of the word ''byte''). One nibble corresponds to one digit in [[hexadecimal]] and holds one digit or a sign code in binary-coded decimal.\n\n=== Bytes and octets ===\n{{Main article|Byte}}\nThe term ''byte'' initially meant 'the smallest addressable unit of memory'. In the past, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-bit bytes have all been used. There have also been computers that could address individual bits ('bit-addressed machine'), or that could only address 16- or 32-bit quantities ('word-addressed machine'). The term ''byte'' was usually not used at all in connection with bit- and word-addressed machines.\n\nThe term ''octet'' always refers to an 8-bit quantity. It is mostly used in the field of [[computer network]]ing, where computers with different byte widths might have to communicate.\n\nIn modern usage ''byte'' almost invariably means eight bits, since all other sizes have fallen into disuse; thus ''byte'' has come to be synonymous with ''octet''.\n\n=== Words ===\n{{Main article|Word (data type)}}\nThe term 'word' is used for a small group of bits that are handled simultaneously by processors of a particular [[computer architecture|architecture]]. The size of a word is thus CPU-specific. Many different word sizes have been used, including 6-, 8-, 12-, 16-, 18-, 24-, 32-, 36-, 39-, 40-, 48-, 60-, and 64-bit. Since it is architectural, the size of a ''word'' is usually set by the first CPU in a family, rather than the characteristics of a later compatible CPU. The meanings of terms derived from ''word'', such as ''longword'', ''doubleword'', ''quadword'', and ''halfword'', also vary with the CPU and OS.<ref name=\"agnerfog\" />\n\nPractically all new desktop processors are capable of using 64-bit words, though [[Embedded system|embedded processors]] with 8- and 16-bit word size are still common. The [[36-bit|36-bit word length]] was common in the early days of computers.\n\nOne important cause of non-portability of software is the incorrect assumption that all computers have the same word size as the computer used by the programmer. For example, if a programmer using the C language incorrectly declares as <tt>int</tt> a variable that will be used to store values greater than 2<sup>15</sup>\u22121, the program will fail on computers with 16-bit integers. That variable should have been declared as <tt>long</tt>, which has at least 32 bits on any computer. Programmers may also incorrectly assume that a pointer can be converted to an integer without loss of information, which may work on (some) 32-bit computers, but fail on 64-bit computers with 64-bit pointers and 32-bit integers.\n\n===Short integer===\nA ''short integer'' can represent a whole number that may take less storage, while having a smaller range, compared with a standard integer on the same machine.\n\nIn [[C (programming language)|C]], it is denoted by <tt>short</tt>. It is required to be at least 16 bits, and is often smaller than a standard integer, but this is not required.<ref name=\"c99\" /><ref name=\"drdobbsinteger\" /> A conforming program can assume that it can safely store values between \u2212(2<sup>15</sup>\u22121)<ref name=\"c-std-6.2.6.2p2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1570.pdf |at=section 6.2.6.2, paragraph 2|title=ISO/IEC 9899:201x |accessdate=2016-06-20 |publisher=open-std.org}}</ref> and 2<sup>15</sup>\u22121,<ref name=\"c-std-5.2.4.2.1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1570.pdf |at=section 5.2.4.2.1|title=ISO/IEC 9899:201x |accessdate=2016-06-20 |publisher=open-std.org}}</ref> but it may not assume that the range isn't larger.

The most common subjects include [[Jesus|Christ]], [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[saint]]s and [[angel]]s. Though especially associated with \"portrait\" style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by [[Eastern Christianity]], including narrative scenes.\n\nIcons may also be cast in metal, carved in stone, embroidered on cloth, painted on wood, done in [[mosaic]] or fresco work, printed on paper or metal, etc. Comparable images from [[Western Christianity]] are generally not classified as \"icons\", although \"iconic\" may be used{{by whom?|date= January 2017}} to describe a static style of devotional image.\n\nEastern Orthodox tradition holds that the production of Christian images dates back to the very [[Early Christianity | early days of Christianity]], and that it has been a continuous tradition since then. Modern academic [[art history]] considers that, while images may have existed earlier, the tradition can be traced back only as far as the 3rd century, and that the images which survive from [[Early Christian art]] often differ greatly from later ones. The icons of later centuries can be linked, often closely, to images from the 5th century onwards, though very few of these survive. Widespread destruction of images occurred during the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] of 726-842, although this did settle permanently the question of the appropriateness of images. Since then icons have had a great continuity of style and subject; far greater than in the images of the [[Western church]]. At the same time there has been change and development.\n\n==History==\n\n===Emergence of the icon===\n[[File:Trinity tikhon filatiev.jpg|right|thumb|Russian icon of [[Holy Trinity]]]]\n[[File:Miko\u0142ajDSC 0186.jpg|thumb|The icon of [[St Nicolas]] carved in stone.

Storia delle immagini sacre attribuite a san Luca'' (Pisa: Gisem, 1998).</ref> \n\nAside from the legend that Pilate had made an image of Christ, the 4th-century [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'', provides a more substantial reference to a \"first\" icon of Jesus.  He relates that King [[Abgar V | Abgar]] of [[Edessa]] (died ca 50 CE) sent a letter to Jesus at Jerusalem, asking Jesus to come and heal him of an illness.  In this version there is no image.  A later account found in the Syriac ''[[Doctrine of Addai]]'' (ca. 400 ?) mentions a painted image of Jesus in the story; and even later, in the 6th-century account given by [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], the painted image transforms into an image that miraculously appeared on a towel when Christ pressed the cloth to his wet face.<ref>''Veronica and her Cloth'', Kuryluk, Ewa, Basil Blackwell, Cambridge, 1991</ref> Further legends relate that the cloth remained in Edessa until the 10th century, when it was taken to [[Constantinople]]. It went missing in 1204 when [[Fourth Crusade | Crusaders]] sacked Constantinople, but by then numerous copies had firmly established its iconic type.\n\nThe 4th-century Christian [[Aelius Lampridius]] produced the earliest known written records of Christian images treated like icons (in a [[Paganism|pagan]] or [[Gnostic]] context) in his ''Life of Alexander Severus'' (xxix) that formed part of the ''[[Augustan History]]''. According to Lampridius, the emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (reigned 222\u2013235), himself not a Christian, had kept a domestic chapel for the [[veneration]] of images of deified emperors, of portraits of his ancestors, and of Christ, [[Apollonius of Tyana|Apollonius]], [[Orpheus]] and [[Abraham]].  Saint [[Irenaeus of Lyons|Irenaeus]], (c. 130\u2013202) in his ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (1:25;6) says scornfully of the Gnostic [[Carpocratians]]:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles [pagans]\".\n</blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, Irenaeus does not speak critically of icons or portraits in a general sense \u2013 only of certain gnostic sectarians' use of icons.\n\nAnother criticism of image veneration appears in the non-canonical 2nd-century ''[[Acts of John]]'' (generally considered a [[gnostic]] work), in which the [[Apostle John]] discovers that one of his followers has had a portrait made of him, and is venerating it: (27)\n\n<blockquote>\n\"...he [John] went into the bedchamber, and saw the portrait of an old man crowned with garlands, and lamps and altars set before it. And he called him and said: Lycomedes, what do you mean by this matter of the portrait?  Can it be one of thy gods that is painted here?  For I see that you are still living in heathen fashion.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nLater in the passage John says, \"But this that you have now done is childish and imperfect: you have drawn a dead likeness of the dead.\"\n\nAt least some of the hierarchy of the Christian churches still strictly opposed icons in the early 4th century.  At the Spanish non-ecumenical [[Synod of Elvira]] (c. 305) bishops concluded, \"Pictures are not to be placed in churches, so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration\".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.conorpdowling.com/library/council-of-elvira |title= The Gentle Exit \u00bb Council of Elvira |work= Conorpdowling.com |date= |accessdate= 2012-12-10}}</ref> Bishop [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], wrote his letter 51 to John, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 394) in which he recounted how he tore down an image in a church and admonished the other bishop that such images are \"opposed . . . to our religion\".<ref>Paragraph 9, http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001051.htm</ref>\n\nElsewhere in his ''Church History'', [[Eusebius]] reports seeing what he took to be portraits of Jesus, [[Saint Peter | Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle | Paul]], and also mentions a bronze statue at [[Banias]] / Paneas under Mount Hermon, of which he wrote, \"They say that this statue is an image of Jesus\" (''H.E.'' 7:18); further, he relates that locals regarded the image as a memorial of the healing of the woman with an issue of blood by Jesus (Luke 8:43-48), because it depicted a standing man wearing a double cloak and with arm outstretched, and a woman kneeling before him with arms reaching out as if in supplication. John Francis Wilson<ref>John Francis Wilson: ''Caesarea Philippi: Banias, the Lost City of Pan'' [[I.B. Tauris]], London, 2004.</ref> suggests the possibility that this refers to a pagan bronze statue whose true identity had been forgotten; some{{who?|date=September 2016}} have thought it to represent [[Aesculapius]], the Greek god of healing, but the description of the standing figure and the woman kneeling in supplication precisely matches images found on coins depicting the bearded emperor [[Hadrian]] reaching out to a female figure \u2013 symbolizing a [[Roman province | province]] \u2013 kneeling before him.\n\nWhen asked by [[Flavia Julia Constantia|Constantia]] (Emperor Constantine's sister) for an image of Jesus, Eusebius denied the request, replying: \"To depict purely the human form of Christ before its transformation, on the other hand, is to break the commandment of God and to fall into pagan error.\"<ref>David M. Gwynn, From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy [Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 225\u2013251], p. 227.</ref>\n\nAfter the emperor [[Constantine I]] extended [[Edict of Milan | official toleration of Christianity]] within the Roman Empire in 313, huge numbers of pagans became converts. This period of [[Christianization]] probably saw the use of Christian images became very widespread among the faithful, though with great differences from pagan habits. Robin Lane Fox states<ref>Fox, ''Pagans and Christians'',  [[Alfred A. Knopf]], New York, 1989.</ref> \"By the early fifth century, we know of the ownership of private icons of saints; by c. 480-500, we can be sure that the inside of a saint's shrine would be adorned with images and votive portraits, a practice which had probably begun earlier.\"\n\nWhen Constantine himself (reigned 306-337) apparently converted to Christianity, the majority of his subjects remained pagans. The [[Roman Imperial cult]] of the divinity of the emperor, expressed through the traditional burning of candles and the offering of incense to the emperor\u2019s image, was tolerated for a period because it would have been politically dangerous to attempt to suppress it.{{cn|date=September 2016}}  Indeed, in the 5th century the courts of justice and municipal buildings of the empire still honoured the portrait of the reigning emperor in this way. In 425 [[Philostorgius]], an allegedly [[Arian]] Christian, charged the Orthodox Christians in Constantinople with [[idolatry]] because they still honored the image of the emperor Constantine the Great, the founder of the city, in this way. [[Gregory Dix | Dix]] notes that this occurred more than a century before we find the first reference to a similar honouring of the image of Christ or of His apostles or saints, but that it would seem a natural progression for the image of Christ, the King of Heaven and Earth, to be paid similar veneration as that given to the earthly Roman emperor.<ref>Dom Gregory Dix, The Shape of the Liturgy (New York: Seabury Press, 1945) 413-414.</ref>  However, the Orthodox, Eastern Catholics, and other groups insist on explicitly distinguishing the veneration of icons from the worship of idols by pagans.<ref>\nhttp://orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/icon_bowing.aspx\n</ref>\nSee further below on this topic.\n\n===Theodosius to Justinian===\n[[File:L'abb\u00e9 M\u00e9na et le Christ 01.JPG|thumb|[[Icon of Christ and Abbot Mena|Christ and Saint Menas]], 6th-century [[Coptic art|Coptic icon]] from [[Egypt]] ([[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]]).]]\n\nAfter adoption of Christianity as the only permissible Roman state religion under [[Theodosius I]], Christian art began to change not only in quality and sophistication, but also in nature.  This was in no small part due to Christians being free for the first time to express their faith openly without persecution from the state, in addition to the faith spreading to the non-poor segments of society.  Paintings of martyrs and their feats began to appear, and early writers commented on their lifelike effect, one of the elements a few Christian writers  criticized in pagan art &mdash; the ability to imitate life.  The writers mostly criticized pagan works of art for pointing to false gods,  thus encouraging idolatry.   Statues in the round were avoided as being too close to the principal artistic focus of pagan cult practices, as they have continued to be (with some small-scale exceptions) throughout the history of [[Eastern Christianity]].\n\n[[Nilus of Sinai]] (d. c.430), in his ''Letter to Heliodorus Silentiarius'', records a miracle in which St. Plato of Ankyra appeared to a Christian in a dream. The Saint was recognized because the young man had often seen his portrait.  This recognition of a religious apparition from likeness to an image was also a characteristic of pagan pious accounts of appearances of gods to humans, and was a regular ''topos'' in hagiography.  One critical recipient of a vision from [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki]] apparently specified that the saint resembled the \"more ancient\" images of him \u2013 presumably the 7th-century mosaics still in [[Hagios Demetrios]].  Another, an African bishop, had been rescued from Arab slavery by a young soldier called Demetrios, who told him to go to his house in Thessaloniki.  Having discovered that most young soldiers in the city seemed to be called Demetrios, he gave up and went to the largest church in the city, to find his rescuer on the wall.<ref name=\"RC\">Robin Cormack, \"Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons\", 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}</ref><!--no connection to Icon:\"However, in the Old Testament we read of prophets having dreams of various heavenly figures, including a vision of God who appeared to Daniel as an elderly man, the \"Ancient of Days\".-->\n\n[[File:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg|thumb|The oldest surviving icon of [[Christ Pantocrator]], [[Encaustic painting|encaustic on panel]], c. 6th century ([[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], [[Mount Sinai]]).]]\nDuring this period the church began to discourage all non-religious human images \u2013 the Emperor and donor figures counting as religious.  This became largely effective, so that most of the population would only ever see religious images and those of the ruling class.  The word icon referred to any and all images, not just religious ones, but there was barely a need for a separate word for these.\n\n===Luke's portrait of Mary===\nIt is in a context attributed to the 5th century that the first mention of an image of Mary painted from life appears, though earlier paintings on [[Catacombs of Rome|catacomb walls]] bear resemblance to modern icons of Mary. [[Theodorus Lector]], in his 6th-century ''History of the Church'' 1:1<ref>Excerpted by Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopoulos; this passage is by some considered a later interpolation.</ref> stated that [[Licinia Eudoxia|Eudokia]] (wife of emperor [[Theodosius II]], died 460) sent an image of the \"[[Theotokos|Mother of God]]\" named [[Hodegetria|Icon of the Hodegetria]] from Jerusalem to [[Pulcheria]], daughter of [[Arcadius]], the former emperor and father of Theodosius II. The image was specified to have been \"painted by the Apostle Luke.\"\n\n[[Margherita Guarducci]] relates a tradition that the original icon of Mary attributed to Luke, sent by Eudokia to Pulcheria from Palestine, was a large circular icon only of her head. When the icon arrived in Constantinople it was fitted in as the head into a very large rectangular icon of her holding the Christ child and it is this composite icon that became the one historically known as the Hodegetria. She further states another tradition that when the last Latin Emperor of Constantinople, [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]], fled Constantinople in 1261 he took this original circular portion of the icon with him. This remained in the possession of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin dynasty]] who had it likewise inserted into a much larger image of Mary and the Christ child, which is presently enshrined above the high altar of the Benedictine Abbey church of [[Montevergine]].<ref>http://www.avellinomagazine.it/foto%20home%20page/madonna.jpg</ref><ref>http://www.mariadinazareth.it/www2005/Apparizioni/Montevergine4.jpg</ref> Unfortunately this icon has been over the subsequent centuries subjected to repeated repainting, so that it is difficult to determine what the original image of Mary\u2019s face would have looked like.

Though by this time opposition to images was strongly entrenched in Judaism and Islam, attribution of the impetus toward an iconoclastic movement in Eastern Orthodoxy to Muslims or Jews \"''seems to have been highly exaggerated, both by contemporaries and by modern scholars''\".<ref>Pelikan, ''The Spirit of Eastern Christendom''</ref>\n\nThough significant in the history of religious doctrine, the Byzantine controversy over images is not seen as of primary importance in Byzantine history.  \"Few historians still hold it to have been the greatest issue of the period...\"<ref>Patricia Karlin-Hayter, ''Oxford History of Byzantium'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2002.</ref>\n\nThe Iconoclastic Period began when images were banned by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] sometime between 726 and 730. Under his son [[Constantine V]], a  council forbidding image veneration was held at Hieria<ref>See [[Council of Hieria]].</ref> near Constantinople in 754.  Image veneration was later reinstated by the [[Irene (empress)|Empress Regent Irene]], under whom another   council was held reversing the decisions of the previous iconoclast council and taking its title as [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]].  The council anathemized all who hold to iconoclasm, i.e. those who held that veneration of images constitutes idolatry. Then the ban was enforced again by [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] in 815. And finally icon veneration was decisively restored by [[Theodora (9th century)|Empress Regent Theodora]] in 843.\n\nFrom then on all Byzantine coins had a religious image or symbol on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]], usually an image of Christ for larger denominations, with the head of the Emperor on the obverse, reinforcing the bond of the state and the divine order.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\n[[File:vladimirskaya.jpg|right|thumb|The \"[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]\" icon (12th century) symbol of [[Russia]]]]\n\n==Acheiropoieta==\n{{main|Acheiropoieta}}\nThe tradition of ''acheiropoieta''  ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1}}, literally \"not-made-by-hand\") accrued to icons that are  alleged to have come into existence miraculously, not by a human painter. Such images functioned as powerful [[relic]]s as well as icons, and their images were naturally seen as especially authoritative as to the true appearance of the subject: naturally and especially because of the reluctance to accept mere human productions as embodying anything of the divine, a commonplace of Christian deprecation of man-made \"[[Cult image|idol]]s\". Like icons believed to be painted directly from the live subject, they therefore acted as important references for other images in the tradition.  Beside the developed legend of the ''mandylion'' or [[Image of Edessa]],  was the tale of the [[Veil of Veronica]], whose very name signifies \"true icon\" or \"true image\", the fear of a \"false image\" remaining strong.\n\n==Stylistic developments==\n[[File:Petersinai.jpg|thumb|left|St Peter [[Encaustic painting|encaustic on panel]], c. 6th century ([[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]).]]\nAlthough there are earlier records of their use, no [[panel painting|panel]] icons earlier than the few from the 6th century preserved at the [[Greek Orthodox]] [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]] survive,<ref>G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'',1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}</ref> as the other examples in Rome have all been drastically over-painted.  The surviving evidence for the earliest depictions of Christ, Mary and saints therefore comes from wall-paintings, [[mosaic]]s and some carvings.<ref>Beckwith, 80-95 covers all these, plus the few other stray painted images elsewhere</ref> They are realistic in appearance, in contrast to the later stylization. They are broadly similar in style, though often much superior in quality, to the [[Fayum portraits|mummy portraits]] done in wax ([[encaustic painting|encaustic]]) and found at [[Fayyum]] in Egypt. As we may judge from such items, the first depictions of Jesus were generic rather than portrait images, generally representing him as a beardless young man.  It was some time before the earliest examples of the long-haired, bearded face that was later to become standardized as the image of Jesus appeared.  When they did begin to appear there was still variation.  [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430)<ref>''De Trinitatis'' 8:4-5.</ref> said that no one knew the appearance of Jesus or that of Mary.  However, Augustine was not a resident of the Holy Land and therefore was not familiar with the local populations and their oral traditions.  Gradually, paintings of Jesus took on characteristics of portrait images.\n\nAt this time the manner of depicting Jesus was not yet uniform, and there was some controversy over which of the two most common icons was to be favored.  The first or \"Semitic\" form showed Jesus with short and \"frizzy\" hair; the second showed a bearded Jesus with hair parted in the middle, the manner in which the god Zeus was depicted.  Theodorus Lector remarked<ref>''Church History'' 1:15.</ref> that of the two, the one with short and frizzy hair was \"more authentic\". To support his assertion, he relates a story (excerpted by John of Damascus) that a pagan commissioned to paint an image of Jesus used the \"Zeus\" form instead of the \"Semitic\" form, and that as punishment his hands withered.\n\nThough their development was gradual, we can date the full-blown appearance and general ecclesiastical (as opposed to simply popular or local) acceptance of Christian images as venerated and miracle-working objects to the 6th century, when, as Hans Belting writes,<ref>Belting, ''Likeness and Presence'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1994.</ref> \"we first hear of the church's use of religious images.\" \"As we reach the second half of the sixth century, we find that images are attracting direct veneration and some of them are credited with the performance of miracles\"<ref>Patricia Karlin-Hayter, The Oxford History of Byzantium, Oxford, 2002.</ref>  Cyril Mango writes,<ref>Mango, ''The Art of the Byzantine Empire 312-1453'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1986.</ref> \"In the post-Justinianic period the icon assumes an ever increasing role in popular devotion, and there is a proliferation of miracle stories connected with icons, some of them rather shocking to our eyes\".   However, the earlier references by Eusebius and Irenaeus indicate veneration of images and reported miracles associated with them as early as the 2nd century.  What might be shocking to our contemporary eyes may not have been viewed as such by the early Christians.   Acts 5:15 reports that \"people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by.\"\n\n==Symbolism==\nIn the icons of Eastern Orthodoxy, and of the Early Medieval West, very little room is made for artistic license.  Almost everything within the image has a symbolic aspect.  Christ, the saints, and the angels all have halos. Angels (and often [[John the Baptist]]) have wings because they are messengers.  Figures have consistent facial appearances, hold attributes personal to them, and use a few conventional poses.\n\nColour plays an important role as well. Gold represents the radiance of Heaven; red, divine life. Blue is the color of human life, white is the [[Uncreated Light]] of God, only used for [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]] of Christ. If you look at icons of Jesus and Mary: Jesus wears red undergarment with a blue outer garment (God become Human) and Mary wears a blue undergarment with a red overgarment (human was granted gifts by God), thus the doctrine of [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|deification]] is conveyed by icons.  Letters are symbols too. Most icons incorporate some calligraphic text naming the person or event depicted. Even this is often presented in a stylized manner.\n\n==Miracles==\n[[File:fedorovskaya.jpg|thumb|''[[Our Lady of St. Theodore]]'', a 1703 copy of the 11th-century icon, following the same Byzantine \"Tender Mercy\" type as the Vladimirskaya above.]]\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition there are reports of particular, [[Wonderworking]] icons that exude [[myrrh]] (fragrant, healing oil), or perform [[miracle]]s upon petition by believers. When such reports are verified by the Orthodox hierarchy, they are understood as miracles performed by God through the prayers of the saint, rather than being magical properties of the painted wood itself. Theologically, all icons are considered to be sacred, and are miraculous by nature, being a means of spiritual communion between the heavenly and earthly realms. However, it is not uncommon for specific icons to be characterised as \"miracle-working\", meaning that God has chosen to [[glorification|glorify]] them by working miracles through them. Such icons are often given particular names (especially those of the Virgin Mary), and even taken from city to city where believers gather to venerate them and pray before them. Islands like that of [[Tinos]] are renowned for possessing such \"miraculous\" icons, and are visited every year by thousands of [[pilgrim]]s.\n\n==Eastern Orthodox teaching==\n[[File:Eastern Orthodox prayer corner.jpg|right|thumb|A fairly elaborate [[Orthodox Christian]] icon corner as would be found in a private home.]]\n[[File:VergineTricherusa.jpg|left|thumb|[[Trojeru\u010dica]] meaning \"Three-handed Theotokos\" is the most important icon of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and main icon of [[Mount Athos]].]]\n[[File:Vsex skorbyashix Radost (litografia).jpg|left|thumb|A precious Russian icon of [[Joy of All Who Sorrow]], [[1862]].]]\nThe Eastern Orthodox view of the origin of icons is generally quite different from that of most secular scholars and from some in contemporary Roman Catholic circles:  \"The Orthodox Church maintains and teaches that the sacred image has existed from the beginning of Christianity\", [[L\u00e9onid Ouspensky]] has written.<ref>Leonid Ouspensky, ''Theology of the Icon'', St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1978.</ref>  Accounts that some non-Orthodox writers consider legendary are accepted as history within Eastern Orthodoxy,  because they are a part of church tradition.  Thus accounts such as that of the miraculous \"Image Not Made by Hands\", and the [[Weeping Icon|weeping and moving]] \"Mother of God of the Sign\" of Novgorod are accepted as fact: \"Church Tradition tells us, for example, of the existence of an Icon of the Savior during His lifetime (the \"Icon-Made-Without-Hands\") and of Icons of the Most-Holy Theotokos [Mary] immediately after Him.\"<ref>''These Truths We Hold'', St. Tikhon's Seminary Press, 1986.</ref> Eastern Orthodoxy further teaches that \"a clear understanding of the importance of Icons\" was part of the church from its very beginning, and has never changed, although explanations of their importance may have developed over time.  This is because icon painting is rooted in the theology of the Incarnation (Christ being the ''eikon'' of God) which didn't change, though its subsequent clarification within the Church occurred over the period of the first seven Ecumenical Councils.  Also, icons served as tools of edification for the illiterate faithful during most of the history of Christendom. Thus, icons are words in painting; they refer to the history of salvation and to its manifestation in concrete persons. In the Orthodox Church \"icons have always been understood as a visible gospel, as a testimony to the great things given man by God the incarnate Logos\"<ref>[[Constantine B. Scouteris]], \"Never as Gods\": Icons and Their Veneration, ''Sobornost,'' 6 (1984), pp. 6-18 (available at http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/liturgics/scouteris_icons.html).</ref>. In the Council of 860 it was stated that \"all that is uttered in words written in syllables is also proclaimed in the language of colors\"<ref>Mansi xvi. 40D. See also Evdokimov, L' Orthodoxie (Neuchatel 1965), p. 222.</ref>. \n\nEastern Orthodox find the first instance of an image or icon in the Bible when God made man in His own image (Septuagint Greek ''eikona''), in Genesis 1:26-27. In Exodus, God commanded that the Israelites not make any graven image; but soon afterwards, he commanded that they make graven images of cherubim and other like things, both as statues and woven on tapestries. Later, Solomon included still more such imagery when he built the first temple. Eastern Orthodox believe these qualify as icons, in that they were visible images depicting heavenly beings and, in the case of the cherubim, used to indirectly indicate God's presence above the Ark.\n\nIn the Book of Numbers it is written that God told Moses to make a bronze serpent, ''[[Nehushtan]]'', and hold it up, so that anyone looking at the snake would be healed of their snakebites. In John 3, Jesus refers to the same serpent, saying that he must be lifted up in the same way that the serpent was.  [[John of Damascus]] also regarded the brazen serpent as an icon. Further, Jesus Christ himself is called the \"image of the invisible God\" in Colossians 1:15, and is therefore in one sense an icon. As people are also made in God's images, people are also considered to be living icons, and are therefore [[Thurible|\"censed\"]] along with painted icons during Orthodox prayer services.\n\n[[File:Italo-Byzantinischer Maler des 13. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|A somewhat disinterested treatment of the emotional subject and painstaking attention to the throne and other details of the material world distinguish this work by a medieval [[Sicily|Sicilian]] master from works by imperial icon-painters of [[Constantinople]].]]\n\nAccording to John of Damascus, anyone who tries to destroy icons \"is the enemy of Christ, the Holy Mother of God and the saints, and is the defender of the Devil and his demons.\" This is because the theology behind icons is closely tied to the Incarnational theology of the humanity and divinity of Jesus, so that attacks on icons typically have the effect of undermining or attacking the Incarnation of Jesus himself as elucidated in the Ecumenical Councils.\n\n[[Basil of Caesarea]], in his writing ''On the Holy Spirit'', says: \"The honor paid to the image passes to the prototype\". He also illustrates the concept by saying, \"If I point to a statue of Caesar and ask you 'Who is that?', your answer would properly be, 'It is Caesar.' When you say such you do not mean that the stone itself is Caesar, but rather, the name and honor you ascribe to the statue passes over to the original, the archetype, Caesar himself.\"<ref>See also Price, S.R.F. ''Rituals and power: the Roman imperial cult in Asia Minor,'' (reprint, illustrated). Cambridge University Press, 1986, pp. 204-5, paraphrasing St. Basil, ''Homily'' 24: \"on seeing an image of the king in the square, one does not allege that there are two kings\". Veneration of the image venerates its original: a similar analogy is implicit in the images used for the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman Imperial cult]]. It does not occur in the Gospels.</ref> So it is with an Icon.\n\nThus to kiss an icon of Christ, in the Eastern Orthodox view, is to show love towards Christ Jesus himself, not mere wood and paint making up the physical substance of the icon. Worship of the icon as somehow entirely separate from its prototype is expressly forbidden by the Seventh Ecumenical Council<ref>On this point see ''inter alia'' [[Constantine B. Scouteris]], \"Never as Gods\": Icons and Their Veneration, ''Sobornost,'' 6 (1984), pp. 6-18 (available at http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/liturgics/scouteris_icons.html).</ref>.\n\nIcons are often illuminated with a candle or jar of oil with a wick. (Beeswax for candles and olive oil for oil lamps are preferred because they burn very cleanly, although other materials are sometimes used.) The illumination of religious images with lamps or candles is an ancient practice pre-dating Christianity.\n\n==Icon painting tradition by region==\n===Eastern Roman Empire=== \n[[File:Ohrid annunciation icon.jpg|thumb|A key piece of [[Palaiologos|Palaiologan]] Mannerism - the [[Annunciation]] icon from [[Ohrid]] in the [[Republic of Macedonia]].]]\n\nOf the icon painting tradition that developed in Byzantium, with Constantinople as the chief city, we have only a few icons from the 11th century and none preceding them, in part because of the Iconoclastic reforms during which many were destroyed or lost, and also because of plundering by the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1204 during the [[Fourth Crusade]], and finally the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.\n\nIt was only in the [[Komnenos|Comnenian]] period (1081\u20131185) that the cult of the icon became widespread in the Byzantine world, partly on account of the dearth of richer materials (such as mosaics, [[ivory]], and [[vitreous enamel]]s), but also because an ''[[iconostasis]]'' a special screen for icons was introduced then in ecclesiastical practice. The style of the time was severe, hieratic and distant.\n\nIn the late Comnenian period this severity softened, and emotion, formerly avoided, entered icon painting. Major monuments for this change include the murals at [[Daphni Monastery]] (ca. 1100) and the [[Church of St. Panteleimon (Gorno Nerezi)|Church of St. Panteleimon]] near [[Skopje]] (1164). The [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] (ca. 1115, ''illustration, right'') is probably the most representative example of the new trend towards spirituality and emotion.\n\nThe tendency toward emotionalism in icons continued in the [[Palaiologos|Paleologan period]], which began in 1261.  Palaiologan art reached its pinnacle in mosaics such as those of [[Chora Church]]. In the last half of the 14th century, Palaiologan saints were painted in an exaggerated manner, very slim and in contorted positions, that is, in a style known as the Palaiologan Mannerism, of which [[:File:Ohrid annunciation icon.jpg|Ochrid's Annunciation]] is a superb example.\n\nAfter 1453, the Byzantine tradition was carried on in regions previously influenced by its religion and culture \u2014 in the Balkans, Russia, and other Slavic countries, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]] in the Caucasus, and among Eastern Orthodox minorities in the Islamic world.  In the Greek-speaking world [[Crete]], ruled by [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] until the mid-17th century, was an important centre of painted icons, as home of the [[Cretan School]], exporting many to Europe.\n\n===Crete===\n{{main|Cretan School}}\n\nCrete was under Venetian control from 1204 and became a thriving center of art with eventually a ''Scuola di San Luca'', or organized painter's guild, the [[Guild of Saint Luke]], on Western lines.  Cretan painting was heavily patronized both by Catholics of Venetian territories and by Eastern Orthodox.  For ease of transport, Cretan painters specialized in panel paintings, and developed the ability to work in many styles to fit the taste of various patrons. [[El Greco]], who moved to [[Venice]] after establishing his reputation in Crete, is the most famous artist of the school, who continued to use many Byzantine conventions in his works.  In 1669 the city of Heraklion, on Crete, which at one time boasted at least 120 painters, finally fell to the Turks, and from that time Greek icon painting went into a decline, with a revival attempted in the 20th century by art reformers such as [[Photis Kontoglou]], who emphasized a return to earlier styles.\n\n===Russia===\n[[File:Descent into Hell by Dionisius and workshop (Ferapontov monastery).jpg|thumb|Muscovite Mannerism: ''[[Harrowing of Hell]]'', by [[Dionisius]] and his workshop.]]\n{{main|Russian icons|List of oldest Russian icons}}\n\nRussian icons are typically paintings on wood, often small, though some in churches and monasteries may be as large as a table top. Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the ''krasny ugol'' \u2013 the \"red\" corner (see [[Icon corner]]). There is a rich history and elaborate [[religious symbolism]] associated with icons. In Russian churches, the [[nave]] is typically separated from the [[sanctuary]] by an ''[[iconostasis]]'', a wall of icons.\n\n[[File:rublev's saviour.jpg|left|thumb|[[Christ the Redeemer (icon)|Christ the Redeemer]] (1410s, by [[Andrei Rublev]]).]]\n\nThe use and making of icons entered [[Kievan Rus']] following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 988 AD.  As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians\u2014notably [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Dionisius]]\u2014widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere.  The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the 17th century, when [[Simon Ushakov]]'s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.\n\nIn the mid-17th century, changes in liturgy and practice instituted by [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]] resulted in a split in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The traditionalists, the persecuted \"Old Ritualists\" or \"[[Old Believers]]\", continued the traditional stylization of icons, while the State Church modified its practice. From that time icons began to be painted not only in the traditional stylized and nonrealistic mode, but also in a mixture of Russian stylization and Western European realism, and in a Western European manner very much like that of Catholic religious art of the time. The [[Stroganov School]] and the icons from [[Nevyansk]] rank among the last important schools of Russian icon-painting.\n\n=== Romania ===\n{{main|Romanian Orthodox icons}}\n\nIn [[Romania]], icons painted as reversed images behind glass and set in frames were common in the 19th century and are still made. The process is known as [[reverse glass painting]]. \"In the Transylvanian countryside, the expensive icons on panels imported from Moldavia, Wallachia, and Mt. Athos were gradually replaced by small, locally produced icons on glass, which were much less expensive and thus accessible to the Transylvanian peasants[.]\"<ref>Dancu, Juliana and Dumitru Dancu, ''Romanian Icons on Glass'', [[Wayne State University Press]], 1982.</ref>\n\n===Egypt and Ethiopia===\n{{main|Coptic art}}\nThe [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] also have distinctive, living icon painting traditions. Coptic icons have their origin in the Hellenistic art of Egyptian Late Antiquity, as exemplified by the [[Fayum mummy portraits]]. Beginning in the 4th century, churches painted their walls and made icons to reflect an authentic expression of their faith.\n\n==Western Christianity==\n[[File:Archangel Michael Hajdudorog.JPG|thumb|right|A Western style icon of the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] in the Greek Catholic [[Iconostasis of the Cathedral of Hajd\u00fadorog]]]]\n[[File:Czestochowska.jpg|thumb| An icon of [[Black Madonna of Cz\u0119stochowa]], one of the [[national symbol]]s of [[Poland]].]] \n[[File:Icon Cathedral 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Icon of the Melanesian Martyrs at Canterbury Cathedral (Anglican Communion)|Icon of the [[Melanesian Brotherhood]] Martyrs at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] (Anglican Communion)]]\n[[File:Chapkanov-Saint-Nicholas.jpg|thumb|A modern metal icon of [[Saint Nicholas]] by the Bulgarian artist Georgi 'Chapa' Chapkanov.  This depiction differs radically from traditional Orthodox iconography ([[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Gilbert House]], [[Stanley, Falkland Islands]]).]]\nAlthough the word \"icon\" is not used in [[Western Christianity]], there are religious works of art which were largely patterned on Byzantine works, and equally conventional in composition and depiction. Until the 13th century, \"icon\"-like portraits followed East pattern \u2013 although very few survive from this early period. From the 13th century, the western tradition came slowly to allow the artist far more flexibility, and a more realist approach to the figures.  If only because there was a much smaller number of skilled artists, the quantity of works of art, in the sense of panel paintings, was much smaller in the West, and in most Western settings a single [[diptych]] as an altarpiece, or in a domestic room, probably stood in place of the larger collections typical of Orthodox \"[[icon corner]]s\".\n\nOnly in the 15th century did production of painted works of art begin to approach Eastern levels, supplemented by mass-produced imports from the [[Cretan School]]. In this century, the use of \"icon\"-like portraits in the West was enormously increased by the introduction of [[old master print]]s on [[paper]], mostly [[woodcut]]s which were produced in vast numbers (although hardly any survive).  They were mostly sold, hand-coloured, by churches, and the smallest sizes (often only an inch high) were affordable even by [[peasant]]s, who glued or pinned them straight onto a wall.\n\nWith the [[Reformation]], after an initial uncertainty among early Lutherans, who painted a few \"icon\"-like depictions of leading Reformers, and continued to paint scenes from Scripture, Protestants came down firmly against icon-like portraits, especially larger ones, even of Christ. Many Protestants found these \"idolatrous\".\n\n===Catholic Church view===\nThe Roman Catholic Church accepted the decrees of the iconodule Seventh Ecumenical Council regarding images. There is some minor difference, however, in the Catholic attitude to images from that of the Orthodox. Following Gregory the Great, Catholics emphasize the role of images as the ''Biblia Pauperum'', the \"Bible of  the Poor,\" from which those who could not read could nonetheless learn.\n\nCatholics also, however, share the same viewpoint with the Orthodox when it comes to image veneration, believing that whenever approached, sacred images are to be reverenced. Though using both flat wooden panel and stretched canvas paintings, Catholics traditionally have also favored images in the form of three-dimensional statuary, whereas in the East, statuary is much less widely employed.\n\n===Lutheran view===\nA recent joint Lutheran\u2013Orthodox statement made in the 7th Plenary of the Lutheran\u2013Orthodox Joint Commission, on July 1993 in Helsinki, reaffirmed the [[ecumenical council]] decisions on the nature of Christ and the veneration of images:\n\n{{quote|7. As Lutherans and Orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches. The ecumenical councils maintain the integrity of the teaching of the undivided Church concerning the saving, illuminating/justifying and glorifying acts of God and reject heresies which subvert the saving work of God in Christ. Orthodox and Lutherans, however, have different histories. Lutherans have received the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed with the addition of the [[filioque]]. The Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches, was not part of the tradition received by the Reformation. Lutherans, however, rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century, and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the Triune God alone and all other forms of veneration (CA 21). Through historical research this council has become better known. Nevertheless it does not have the same significance for Lutherans as it does for the Orthodox. Yet, Lutherans and Orthodox are in agreement that the Second Council of Nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images (icons) in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, when it states: \"The more frequently, Christ, Mary, the mother of God, and the saints are seen, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects\" (Definition of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~risaarin/lutortjointtext.html |title=lutheran orthodox |publisher=Helsinki.fi |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Analogion]]\n* [[Christian symbolism]]\n* [[Early Christian art and architecture]]\n* [[Holy card]]\n* [[Murti]]\n* [[Orans]]\n* [[Podea]]\n* [[Proskynetarion]]\n* [[Religious image]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Beckwith, John, ''Early Christian and Byzantine Art'', Penguin History of Art (now Yale), 2nd edn. 1979, {{ISBN|0-14-056033-5}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | author= Evans, Helen C. | title= ''Byzantium: faith and power (1261-1557)'' | location=New York | publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2004 | isbn=1-58839-113-2 | url=http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/58371/rec/3 }}\n*{{cite book |author1=Evans, Helen C.  |author2=Wixom, William D | title=''The glory of Byzantium: art and culture of the Middle Byzantine era, A.D. 843-1261'' | location=New York | publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-8109-6507-2 | url=http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll10/id/188784 }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons|Icon}}\n*[http://orthodoxwiki.org/Iconography Iconography] Orthodox Wiki.org\n*[http://www.orthodoxiconography.com/ Orthodox Iconography by Elias Damianakis]\n*[http://archangelsbooks.com/articles/iconography/DiscourseIcon.asp A Discourse in Iconography by St. John of Shanghai and San Francisco]\n*[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/orth_icon.aspx The Iconic and Symbolic in Orthodox Iconography]\n*[http://en.iconskarakallou.gr/icon-worship/ Icon & worship \u2013 Icons of Karakallou Monastery, Mt.Athos]\n*[http://www.ikonograph.com Contemporary Byzantine icon studio, iconography school and orthodox resources]\n*[http://iconography-guide.com Iconography Guide -free eLearning site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110508013624/http://www.ikonograph.com/F.Theodore.html Orthodox iconography by Fr.

It is related to [[SNOBOL]] and SL5, string processing languages. Icon is not [[object-oriented]], but an object-oriented extension called Idol was developed in 1996 which eventually became [[Unicon (programming language)|Unicon]].\n\n==Basic syntax==\nThe Icon language is derived from the [[ALGOL]]-class of [[structured programming]] languages, and thus has syntax similar to [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Icon is most similar to Pascal, using <code>:=</code> syntax for assignments, the <code>procedure</code> keyword and similar syntax. On the other hand, Icon uses C-style brackets for structuring execution groups, and programs start by running a procedure called \"main\".\n\nIn many ways Icon also shares features with most [[scripting language]]s (as well as [[SNOBOL]] and SL5, from which they were taken): variables do not have to be declared, types are cast automatically, and numbers can be converted to strings and back automatically. Another feature common to many scripting languages, but not all, is the lack of a line-ending character; in Icon, lines not ended by a semicolon get ended by an implied semicolon if it makes sense.\n\nProcedures are the basic building blocks of Icon programs. Although they use Pascal naming, they work more like C functions and can return values; there is no <code>function</code> keyword in Icon.\n\n<pre>\n procedure doSomething(aString)\n   write(aString)\n end</pre>\n\n==Goal-directed execution==\nOne of Icon's key concepts is that control structures are based on the \"success\" or \"failure\" of expressions, rather than on boolean logic, as in most other programming languages. Under this model, simple comparisons like <code>if&nbsp;a&nbsp;<&nbsp;b</code> do not mean \"if the operations to the right evaluate to true\" as they would under most languages; instead it means something more like \"if the operations to the right ''succeed\"''. In this case the < operator succeeds if the comparison is true, so the end result is the same. In addition, the < operator returns its second argument if it succeeds, allowing things like <code>if&nbsp;a&nbsp;<&nbsp;b&nbsp;<&nbsp;c</code>, a common type of comparison that in most languages must be written as a conjunction of two inequalities like <code>if&nbsp;a&nbsp;<&nbsp;b&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;b&nbsp;<&nbsp;c</code>.\n\nThe utility of this concept becomes much clearer when you consider real-world examples. Since Icon uses success or failure for all flow control, this simple code:\n\n<pre>\nif a := read() then write(a)</pre>\n\nwill copy one line of [[standard input]] to standard output. This code will work even if the read() causes an error, for instance, if the file does not exist. In that case the statement <code>a := read()</code> will fail, and write will simply not be called.\n\nSuccess and failure are passed \"up\" through functions, meaning that a failure inside a [[nested function]] will cause the functions calling it to fail as well. For instance, we can write a program to copy an entire input file to output in a single line:\n\n<pre>\nwhile write(read())</pre>\n\nWhen the read() command fails, at the end of file for instance, the failure will be passed up the chain, and write() will fail as well. The while, being a control structure, stops on failure, meaning it stops when the file is empty. For comparison, consider a similar example written in [[pseudocode]] (using syntax close to [[C++]] and derived languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]]):\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\" enclose=\"pre\">\n try {\n   while ((a = read()) != EOF) {\n     write(a);\n   }\n } catch (Exception e) {\n   // do nothing, exit the loop\n }</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis case needs two comparisons: one for end of file (EOF) and another for all other errors. Since Java does not allow errors to be compared as logic elements, as under Icon, the lengthy <syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\" enclose=\"none\">try/catch</syntaxhighlight> syntax must be used instead. Try blocks also impose a performance penalty for simply using them, even if no error occurs, a [[distributed cost]] that Icon avoids.\n\nIcon refers to this concept as ''goal-directed execution'', referring to the way that execution continues until some goal is reached. In the example above the goal is to read the entire file; the read command continues to succeed while there is more information to be read, and fails when there isn't. The goal is thus coded directly in the language, instead of using statements checking return codes or similar constructs.\n\n==Generators==\nExpressions in Icon often return a single value, for instance, <tt>x < 5</tt> will evaluate and succeed if the value of x is less than 5, or else fail. However several of the examples below rely on the fact that many expressions do not ''immediately'' return success or failure, returning values in the meantime. This drives the examples with <tt>every</tt> and <tt>to</tt>; <tt>every</tt> causes <tt>to</tt> to continue to return values until it fails.\n\nThis is a key concept in Icon, known as [[generator (computer programming)|''generators'']]. Generators drive much of the loop functionality in the language, but do so more directly; the programmer does not write a loop and then pull out and compare values, Icon will do all of this for you.\n\nWithin the parlance of Icon, the evaluation of an expression or function results in a result sequence. A result sequence contains all the possible values that can be generated by the expression or function. When the result sequence is exhausted (e.g. there are no more values within the result sequence), the expression or function fails. Iteration over the result sequence is achieved either implicitly via Icon's goal directed evaluation or explicitly via the <tt>every</tt> clause.\n\nIcon includes several generator-builders. The ''alternator'' syntax allows a series of items to be generated in sequence until one fails:\n<pre>\n 1 | \"hello\" | x < 5</pre>\ncan generate \"1\", \"hello\", and \"5\" if x is less than 5. Alternators can be read as \"or\" in many cases, for instance:\n\n<pre>\n if y < (x | 5) then write(\"y=\", y)</pre>\n\nwill write out the value of y if it is smaller than x ''or'' 5. Internally Icon checks every value from left to right until one succeeds or the list empties and it returns a failure. Remember that functions will not be called unless the calls within do not fail, so this example can be shortened to:\n\n<pre>\n write(\"y=\", (x | 5) > y)</pre>\n\nAnother simple generator is the <code>to</code>, which generates lists of integers; <code>every write(1 to 10)</code> will do exactly what it seems to. The ''bang syntax'' generates every item of a list; <code>every write(!aString)</code> will output each character of aString on a new line.\n\nTo demonstrate the power of this concept, consider string operations. Most languages include a function known as <code>find</code> or <code>indexOf</code> that returns the location of a string within another. Consider:\n\n<pre>\n s = \"All the world's a stage. And all the men and women merely players\";\n i = indexOf(\"the\", s)</pre>\n\nThis code will return 4, the position of the first occurrence of the word \"the\". To get the next instance of \"the\" an alternate form must be used,\n<pre>\n i = indexOf(\"the\", s, 5)</pre>\nthe 5 at the end saying it should look from position 5 on. In order to extract all the occurrences of \"the\", a loop must be used...\n\n<pre>\n s = \"All the world's a stage. And all the men and women merely players\";\n i = indexOf(\"the\", s)\n while i != -1 {\n   write(i);\n   i =  indexOf(\"the\", s, i+1);\n }</pre>\n\nUnder Icon the <tt>find</tt> function is a generator, and will return the next instance of the string each time it is resumed before finally failing after it passes the end of the string. The same code under Icon can be written:\n\n<pre>\n s := \"All the world's a stage. And all the men and women merely players\"\n every write(find(\"the\",s))</pre>\n\n<tt>find</tt> will return the index of the next instance of \"the\" each time it is resumed by <tt>every</tt>, eventually passing the end of the string and failing. As in the prior example, this will cause write to fail, and the (one-line) <tt>every</tt> loop to exit.\n\nOf course there are times where you deliberately want to find a string after some point in input, for instance, you might be scanning a text file containing data in multiple columns. Goal-directed execution works here as well, and can be used this way:\n\n<pre>\n write(5 < find(\"the\", s))\n</pre>\n\nThe position will only be returned if \"the\" appears after position 5, the comparison will fail otherwise, passing that failure to write() as before. There is one small \"trick\" to this code that needs to be considered: comparisons return the right-hand result, so it is important to put the find on the right-hand side of the comparison. If the 5 were placed on the right, 5 would be written.\n\nIcon adds several control structures for looping through\ngenerators. The <tt>every</tt> operator is similar to <tt>while</tt>, looping through every item returned by a generator and exiting on failure:\n\n<pre>\n  every k := i to j do\n   write(someFunction(k))</pre>\n\nWhy use <tt>every</tt> instead of a while loop in this case?\nBecause <tt>while</tt> re-evaluates the first result,\nbut <tt>every</tt> produces all results.\nThe <tt>every</tt> syntax actually injects values into the function in a fashion similar to blocks under [[Smalltalk]]. For instance, the above loop can be re-written this way:\n\n<pre>\n every write(someFunction(i to j))\n</pre>\n\nUsers can build new generators easily using the <tt>suspend</tt> keyword:\n\n<pre>\n procedure findOnlyOdd(pattern, theString)\n   every i := find(pattern, theString) do\n     if i % 2 = 1 then suspend i\n end</pre>\n\nThis example loops over ''theString'' using find to look for ''pattern''. When one is found, and the position is odd, the location is returned from the function with <tt>suspend</tt>. Unlike <tt>return</tt>, <tt>suspend</tt> writes down where it is in the internal generators as well, allowing it to pick up where it left off on the next iteration.\n\n==Strings==\nIn keeping with its script-like functionality, Icon adds a number of features to make working with strings easier. Most notable among these is the ''scanning'' system, which repeatedly calls functions on a string:\n\n<pre>s ? write(find(\"the\"))</pre>\n\nis a short form of the examples shown earlier. In this case the ''subject'' of the <code>find</code> function is placed outside the parameters in front of the question-mark. Icon functions are deliberately (as opposed to automatically) written to identify the subject in parameter lists and allow them to be pulled out in this fashion.\n\nSubstrings can be extracted from a string by using a range specification within brackets. A range specification can return a point to a single character, or a slice of the string. Strings can be indexed from either the right or the left. Positions within a string are defined to be '''between''' the characters <sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>3</sub>C<sub>4</sub> and can be specified from the right <sub>\u22123</sub>A<sub>\u22122</sub>B<sub>\u22121</sub>C<sub>0</sub>\n\nFor example,\n<pre>\n \"Wikipedia\"[1]     ==> \"W\"\n \"Wikipedia\"[3]     ==> \"k\"\n \"Wikipedia\"[0]     ==> \"a\"\n \"Wikipedia\"[1:3]   ==> \"Wi\"\n \"Wikipedia\"[-2:0]  ==> \"ia\"\n \"Wikipedia\"[2+:3]  ==> \"iki\"\n</pre>\nWhere the last example shows using a length instead of an ending position\n\nThe subscripting specification can be used as a [[value (computer science)#lrvalue|lvalue]] within an expression. This can be used to insert strings into another string or delete parts of a string. For example,\n\n<pre>\n    s := \"abc\"\n    s[2] := \"123\"\n    s now has a value of \"a123c\"\n    s := \"abcdefg\"\n    s[3:5] := \"ABCD\"\n    s now has a value of \"abABCDefg\"\n    s := \"abcdefg\"\n    s[3:5] := \"\"\n    s now has a value of \"abefg\"\n</pre>\nAs noted above, Icon's subscript indices are between the elements. Given the string s := \"ABCDEFG\", the indexes are: <sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>3</sub>C<sub>4</sub>D<sub>5</sub>E<sub>6</sub>F<sub>7</sub>G<sub>8</sub>. The slice s[3:5] is the string between the indices 3 and 5, which is the string \"CD\".\n\n==Other structures==\nIcon also allows the user to easily construct their own lists (or ''arrays''):\n\n<pre>aCat := [\"muffins\", \"tabby\", 2002, 8]</pre>\n\nThe items within a list can be of any sort, including other structures. To quickly build larger lists, Icon includes the <code>list</code> generator; <code>i := list(10, \"word\")</code> generates a list containing 10 copies of \"word\".\n\nLike arrays in other languages, Icon allows items to be looked up by position, e.g., <code>weight := aCat[4]</code>. As with strings, the indices are between the elements, and a slice of a list can be obtained by specifying the range, e.g., <code>aCat[2:4]</code> produces the list <code>[\"tabby\",2002]</code>. Unlike strings, a slice using a range cannot be a [[value (computer science)#lrvalue|lvalue]].\n\nThe ''bang-syntax'', e.g., <code>every write(!aCat)</code>, will print out four lines, each with one element.\n\nIcon includes stack-like functions, <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> to allow them to form the basis of stacks and queues.\n\nIcon also includes functionality for sets and tables (known as ''hashes'', ''associative arrays'', ''dictionaries'', etc.):\n\n<pre>\n symbols := table(0)\n symbols[\"there\"] := 1\n symbols[\"here\"] := 2</pre>\n\nThis code creates a table that will use zero as the default value of any unknown key. It then adds two items into it, with the keys \"there\" and \"here\", and values 1 and 2.\n\n==String scanning==\nOne of the powerful features of Icon is string scanning. The scan string operator, <code>?</code> saves the current string scanning environment and creates a new string scanning environment. The string scanning environment consists of two keyword variables, <code>&subject</code> and <code>&pos</code>. Where &subject is the string being scanned, and &pos is the ''cursor'' or current position within the subject string.\n\nFor example,\n<pre>\n  s := \"this is a string\"\n  s ? write(\"subject=[\",&subject,\"] pos=[\",&pos,\"]\")\n</pre>\nwould produce\n<pre>\nsubject=[this is a string] pos=[1]\n</pre>\n\nBuilt-in and user-defined functions can be used to move around within the string being scanned. Many of the built-in functions will default to &subject and &pos (for example the ''find'' function). The following, for example, will write all blank delimited \"words\" in a string.\n\n<pre>\n  s := \"this is a string\"\n  s ? {                               # Establish string scanning environment\n      while not pos(0) do  {          # Test for end of string\n          tab(many(' '))              # Skip past any blanks\n          word := tab(upto(' ') | 0)  # the next word is up to the next blank -or- the end of the line\n          write(word)                 # write the word\n      }\n  }\n</pre>\n\nA more complex example demonstrates the integration of generators and string scanning within the language.\n\n<pre>\n procedure main()\n     s := \"Mon Dec 8\"\n     s ? write(Mdate() | \"not a valid date\")\n end\n # Define a matching function that returns\n # a string that matches a day month dayofmonth\n procedure Mdate()\n # Define some initial values\n static dates\n static days\n initial {\n        days := [\"Mon\",\"Tue\",\"Wed\",\"Thr\",\"Fri\",\"Sat\",\"Sun\"]\n        dates := [\"Jan\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"May\",\"Jun\",\n                  \"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Sep\",\"Oct\",\"Nov\",\"Dec\"]\n }\n every suspend   (retval <-  tab(match(!days)) ||     # Match a day\n                             =\" \" ||                  # Followed by a blank\n                             tab(match(!dates)) ||    # Followed by the month\n                             =\" \" ||                  # Followed by a blank\n                             matchdigits(2)           # Followed by at least 2 digits\n                 ) &\n                 (=\" \" | pos(0) ) &                   # Either a blank or the end of the string\n                 retval                               # And finally return the string\n end\n # Matching function that returns a string of n digits\n procedure matchdigits(n)\n     suspend (v := tab(many(&digits)) & *v <= n) & v\n end\n</pre>\n\nThe idiom of <code> expr<sub>1</sub> & expr<sub>2</sub> & expr<sub>3</sub></code> returns the value of the last expression\n\n==See also==\n*[[Unicon (programming language)]] (a descendant and enhancement of Icon)\n*[[CLU (programming language)]] by Barbara Liskov\n*[[Coroutine]]\n*[[Generator (computer programming)]]\n*[[jq (programming language)]] (a language for managing JSON data streams with goal-directed execution)\n\n==References==\nThe definitive work is ''The Icon Programming Language'' (third edition) by Griswold and Griswold, {{ISBN|1-57398-001-3}}.\nIt is out of print but can be [http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/books.htm downloaded] in PDF form.\n\nIcon also has co-expressions, providing non-local exits for program execution.

New York 1974, p.115.</ref> According to his view, iconology tries to reveal the underlying principles that form the basic attitude of a nation, a period, a class, a religious or philosophical perspective, which is modulated by one personality and condensed into one work.<ref>[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]</ref> According to Roelof van Straten, iconology \"can explain why an artist or patron chose a particular subject at a specific location and time and represented it in a certain way. An iconological investigation should concentrate on the social-historical, not art-historical, influences and values that the artist might not have consciously brought into play but are nevertheless present. The artwork is primarily seen as a document of its time.\"<ref>Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p. 12.</ref>\n\nWarburg used the term \"iconography\" in his early research, replacing it in 1908 with \"iconology\" in his particular method of visual interpretation called \"critical iconology\", which focused on the tracing of motifs through different cultures and visual forms.<ref>[[Michael Hatt]] and Charlotte Klonk, \"Iconography - iconology: Erwin Panofsky\". In ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to Its Methods''. Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 98.</ref> In 1932, Panofsky published a seminal article, introducing a three-step method of visual interpretation dealing with (1) primary or natural subject matter; (2) secondary or conventional subject matter, i.e. iconography; (3) tertiary or intrinsic meaning or content, i.e. iconology.<ref>Erwin Panofsky, \"Zum Problem der Beschreibung und Inhaltsdeutung von Werken der bildenden Kunst.\" ''Logos'', Vol. 21 (1932), pp. 103-119.</ref><ref>[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]</ref> Whereas iconography analyses the world of images, stories and allegories and requires knowledge of literary sources, an understanding of the history of types and how themes and concepts were expressed by objects and events under different historical conditions, iconology interprets intrinsic meaning or content and the world of symbolical values by using \"synthetic intuition\". The interpreter is aware of the essential tendencies of the human mind as conditioned by psychology and world view; he analyses the history of cultural symptoms or symbols, or how tendencies of the human mind were expressed by specific themes due to different historical conditions. Moreover, when understanding the work of art as a document of a specific civilization, or of a certain religious attitude therein, the work of art becomes a symptom of something else, which expresses itself in a variety of other symptoms. Interpreting these symbolical values, which can be unknown to, or different from, the artist's intention, is the object of iconology.<ref>Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, \"Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography\". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''.

Gombrich, ''Reflections on the History of Art: Views and Reviews'', ed. Richard Woodfield. Oxford 1987, p.246.</ref> However, [[Michael Camille]] is of the opinion that \"though Panofsky's concept of iconology has been very influential in the humanities and is quite effective when applied to Renaissance art, it is still problematic when applied to art from periods before and after.\"<ref>[http://art.arizona.edu/downloads/Garcia,_Dominique_Writing_Sample.pdf Dominique E. Garcia, \"Nationalistic Iconography and 'Anti-Iconology' of the Aztec Coatlicue Sculpture\"]</ref>\n\n==Nuances of iconology==\nIn 1952, [[Creighton Gilbert]] added another opinion about the meaning of the word \"iconology\". According to his view, iconology was not the actual investigation of the work of art but rather the result of this investigation. The Austrian art historian [[Hans Sedlmayr]] differentiated between \"sachliche\" and \"methodische\" iconology. \"Sachliche\" iconology refers to the \"general meaning of an individual painting or of an artistic complex (church, palace, monument) as seen and explained with reference to the ideas which take shape in them.\" In contrast, \"methodische\" iconology is the \"integral iconography which accounts for the changes and development in the representations\".<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3407705539/iconology-and-iconography.html Encyclopedia.com: Iconology and Iconography]</ref> In ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology'' (1986), [[W.J.T. Mitchell]] writes that iconology is a study of \"what to say about images\", concerned with the description and interpretation of visual art, and also a study of \"what images say\" \u2013 the ways in which they seem to speak for themselves by persuading, telling stories, or describing.<ref>[http://iconictheory.blogspot.de/2010/05/iconology.html Karen Hope, The Iconic Image: Iconology]</ref> He pleads for a postlinguistic, postsemiotic \"iconic turn\", emphasizing the role of \"non-linguistic symbol systems\".<ref>W.J.T.

J. T. Mitchell's Iconology and Picture Theory]</ref> According to Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, the term \"iconology\" can also be used for characterizing \"a movement toward seeing connections across all the language processes\" and the idea about \"multiple levels and forms used to communicate meaning\" in order to get \"the total picture\u201d of learning. \"Being both literate in the traditional sense and visually literate are the true mark of a well-educated human.\"<ref>[http://wac.colostate.edu/journal/vol8/bartelo_morton.pdf Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, \"Iconology: An Alternate Form of Writing\"]</ref>\n\nFor several years, new approaches to iconology have developed in the theory of images. This is the case of what [[Jean-Michel Durafour]], French philosopher and theorist of cinema, proposed to call \"econology\", a biological approach to images as forms of life, crossing iconology, ecology and sciences of nature. In an econological regime, the image (''eikon'') self-speciates, that is to say, it self-iconicizes with others and eco-iconicizes with them its iconic habitat (''oikos''). The iconology, mainly Warburghian iconology, is thus merged with a conception of the relations between the beings of the nature inherited, among others ([[Arne N\u00e6ss]], etc.) from the writings of [[Kinji Imanishi]]. For Imanishi, living beings are subjects. Or, more precisely, the environment and the living being are juste one. One of the main consequences is that the \"specity\", the living individual, \"self-eco-speciates its place of life\" (''Freedom in Evolution''). As far as the images are concerned: \"If the living species self-specify, the images self-iconicize. This is not a tautology. The images update some of their iconic virtualities. They live in the midst of other images, past or present, but also future (those are only human classifications), which they have relations with. They self-iconicize in an iconic environment which they interact with, and which in particular makes them the images they are. Or more precisely, insofar as images have an active part: ''the images self-eco-iconicize their iconic environment''.<ref>Jean-Michel Durafour, ''\"L'\u00c9trange Cr\u00e9ature du lac noir\" de Jack Arnold.

The term usually refers to the killing of unarmed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] women, children, and elders by colonists and the colonizing military forces. In historical usage, it has also been used by colonists to describe the actions of Native Americans killing colonists. \n\n== Overview ==\n\"Indian massacre\" is a phrase whose use and definition has evolved and expanded over time.  The phrase was initially used by European colonists to describe attacks by indigenous Americans which resulted in mass colonial casualties.  While similar attacks by colonists on Indian villages were called \"raids\" or \"battles\", successful Indian attacks on white settlements or military posts were routinely termed \"massacres\".  Knowing very little about the native inhabitants of the American frontier, the colonists were deeply fearful, and as time passed, \"far more white Americans eagerly consumed Indian atrocity stories around the family table and in popular literature and newspapers than ever interacted with Indians or witnessed an Indian raid.\"  Emphasis was placed on the depredations of \"murderous savages\" in their information about Indians, and as the migrants headed further west, fear was the prevailing emotion behind their thoughts and actions concerning Indians.  In some instances motivated by politics, in Colorado for example, \"stories in the ''News'' continued to stir those fears: wild rumors of Indian conspiracies were heralded as fact; any violence at all between whites and Indians was reported as an Indian 'massacre'\".<ref name=\"Knight\">''Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia''; Peter Knight; ABC-CLIO, 2003; Pg. 523</ref><ref name=\"Stannard\">''American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World''; David E. Stannard; Oxford University Press, 1993; Pg. 130</ref>\n\nThe phrase eventually became commonly used also to describe mass killings of American Indians.  Killings described as \"massacres\" often had an element of indiscriminate targeting, barbarism, or genocidal intent.<ref name=\"Frey\">''Genocide and International Justice''; Rebecca Joyce Frey; InfoBase Publishing, 2009; Pgs. 7-12, 31-54</ref> According to one historian, \"Any discussion of genocide must, of course, eventually consider the so-called [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]]\", the term commonly used for U.S. Army campaigns to subjugate Indian nations of the American West beginning in the 1860s. In an older historiography, key events in this history were narrated as battles. \n\nSince the late 20th century, it has become more common for scholars to refer to certain of these events as massacres, especially if there were large numbers of women and children as victims. This includes the Colorado territorial militia's slaughter of Cheyenne at Sand Creek (1864), and the US army's slaughter of Shoshone at Bear River (1863), Blackfeet on the Marias River (1870), and Lakota at Wounded Knee (1890). Some scholars have begun referring to these events as \"genocidal massacres,\" defined as the annihilation of a portion of a larger group, sometimes to provide a lesson to the larger group.<ref name=\"Ostler\">''Genocide and American Indian History''; Jeffrey Ostler; University of Oregon, 2015</ref>\n\nIt is difficult to determine the total number of people who died as a result of \"Indian massacres\". In ''The Wild Frontier: Atrocities during the American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee'', lawyer William M. Osborn compiled a list of alleged and actual atrocities in what would eventually become the continental United States, from first contact in 1511 until 1890. His parameters for inclusion included the intentional and indiscriminate [[murder]], [[torture]], or mutilation of civilians, the wounded, and prisoners. His list included 7,193 people who died from atrocities perpetrated by those of European descent, and 9,156 people who died from atrocities perpetrated by Native Americans.<ref>Osborn, William M. (2001). ''The Wild Frontier: Atrocities During The American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee''. Garden City, NY: Random House. {{ISBN|978-0-375-50374-0}}.</ref> Many of the incidents included on this list <!-- Which? the one in the article? -->are not mentioned in Osborn's book. \n\nIn ''An American Genocide, The United States and the California Catastrophe, 1846-1873'', historian Benjamin Madley recorded the numbers of killings of California Indians between 1846 and 1873. He found evidence that during this period at least 9,400 to 16,000 California Indians were killed by non-Indians. Most of these killings occurred in what he said were more than 370 massacres (defined by him as the \"intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants, including women, children, and prisoners, whether in the context of a battle or otherwise\").<ref>[[#refMadley2016|Madley 2016]], p.11, p.351</ref>\n\n== List of massacres ==\n{{Dynamic list}}\nThis is a listing of some of the events reported then or referred to now as \"Indian massacre\".

It is used in [[Muslim countries]] to determine the proper days of [[Islamic holiday]]s and rituals, such as the [[Ramadan|annual period of fasting]] and the proper time for the [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]]. In everyday life of these countries the  [[Gregorian calendar]] is used. Rents, wages etc. are paid by the Gregorian calendar, which is also used for agriculture if no traditional [[solar calendar]]s are used for this purpose like the [[Berber calendar]] or the [[Coptic Calendar]], because a lunar calendar is not suited for agricultural work.\n\nThe Islamic calendar employs the [[Hijri era]] whose [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] was retrospectively established as the [[Islamic New Year]] of 622 [[Anno Domini|AD]]/[[Common Era|CE]]. During that year, [[Muhammad]] and his followers migrated from [[Mecca]] to Yathrib (now [[Medina]]) and established the first Muslim community (''[[ummah]]''), an event commemorated as the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]].

Inscriptions of the ancient [[South Arabia]]n calendars reveal the use of a number of local calendars. At least some of these South Arabian calendars followed the [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar system]]. Both [[al-Biruni]] and [[al-Mas'udi]] suggest that the Ancient Arabs used the same month names as the Muslims, though they also record other month names used by the pre-Islamic Arabs.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/>\n\nThe Islamic tradition is unanimous in stating that Arabs of [[Tihamah]], [[Hejaz]], and [[Najd]] distinguished between two types of months, permitted (''\u1e25al\u0101l'') and forbidden (''\u1e25ar\u0101m'') months. The forbidden months were four months during which fighting is forbidden, listed as Rajab and the three months around the [[hajj|pilgrimage]] season, Dhu al-Qa\u2018dah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram. Information about the forbidden months is also found in the writings of [[Procopius]], where he describes an armistice with the Eastern Arabs of the Lakhmid al-Mundhir which happened in the summer of 541 AD/CE. However, Muslim historians do not link these months to a particular season. The [[Qur'an]] links the four forbidden months with ''Nas\u012b\u2019'', a word that literally means \"postponement\".<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> According to Muslim tradition, the decision of postponement was administered by the tribe of [[Kinanah]],<ref name=Moberg2/> by a man known as the ''al-Qalammas'' of Kinanah and his descendants (pl. ''qal\u0101misa'').<ref name=Kitab/>\n\nDifferent interpretations of the concept of ''Nas\u012b\u2019'' have been proposed.<ref>For an overview of the various theories and a discussion of the problem of \"hindsight chronology\" in early and pre-Islamic sources, see [http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/978/1/978.pdf?EThOS%20(BL) Maurice A.

Moberg, \"NASI'\", ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd, VII: 977.</ref> maintain that the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] calendar used in Central Arabia was a purely lunar calendar similar to the modern Islamic calendar. According to this view, ''Nas\u012b\u2019'' is related to the pre-Islamic practices of the Meccan Arabs, where they would alter the distribution of the forbidden months within a given year without implying a calendar manipulation. This interpretation is supported by Arab historians and lexicographers, like [[Ibn Hisham]], [[Ibn Manzur]], and the corpus of [[tafsir|Qur'anic exegesis]].<ref>{{Cite book|edition=4th|publisher=Al-maktaba al-tij\u0101riyya|last=Mu\u1e25ammad al-Khu\u1e0dar\u012b Bayk|title=Mu\u1e25\u0101\u1e0dar\u0101t t\u0101r\u012bkh al-Umam al-Isl\u0101miyya|year=1935|pages=59\u201360|volume=2}}</ref>\n\nThis is corroborated by an early [[Sabaic]] inscription, where a religious ritual was \"postponed\"  (''ns'\u2019w'') due to war. According to the context of this inscription, the verb ''ns'\u2019'' has nothing to do with intercalation, but only with moving religious events within the calendar itself. The similarity between the religious concept of this ancient inscription and the Qur'an suggests that non-calendaring postponement is also the Qur'anic meaning of ''Nas\u012b\u2019''.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> Thus the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' concludes ''\"The Arabic system of [Nas\u012b\u2019] can only have been intended to move the Hajj and the fairs associated with it in the vicinity of Mecca to a suitable season of the year. It was not intended to establish a fixed calendar to be generally observed.\"''<ref>The Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd edition, Index, p. 441</ref>\n\nOthers concur that it was originally a lunar calendar, but suggest that about 200 years before the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] it was transformed into a [[lunisolar calendar]] containing an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary month]] added from time to time to keep the pilgrimage within the season of the year when merchandise was most abundant.

Those who disbelieve are led to error thereby, making it lawful in one year and forbidden in another in order to adjust the number of (the months) made sacred by God and make the sacred ones permissible.

If Nas\u012b' meant intercalation, then the number and the position of the intercalary months between 1 AH and 10 AH are uncertain; Western calendar dates commonly cited for key events in early Islam such as the Hijra, the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Trench, should be viewed with caution as they might be in error by one, two or even three lunar months. This prohibition was mentioned by Muhammad during the [[The Farewell Sermon|farewell sermon]] which was delivered on 9 Dhu al-Hijjah 10 AH (Julian date Friday 6 March, 632 AD/CE) on [[Mount Arafat]] during the [[The Farewell Pilgrimage|farewell pilgrimage]] to Mecca.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{quote|Certainly the Nasi\u2019 is an impious addition, which has led the infidels into error.

Traditionally this is based on actual observation of the crescent (''[[wikt:hilal#Noun|hilal]]'') marking the end of the previous lunar cycle and hence the previous month, thereby beginning the new month. Consequently, each month can have 29 or 30 days depending on the visibility of the moon, astronomical positioning of the earth and weather conditions. However, certain sects and groups, most notably Bohras Muslims namely [[Alavi Bohras|Alavis]], [[Dawoodi Bohra|Dawoodis]] and [[Sulaymani]]s and [[Shia]] [[Ismaili]] Muslims, use a tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) in which odd-numbered months have thirty days (and also the twelfth month in a leap year) and even months have 29.\n\n==Days of the week==\nIn [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the \"first day\" of the week corresponds with Sunday of the planetary week. The Islamic weekdays, like those in the [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]] and [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed calendar|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] calendars, begin at sunset. The Christian liturgical day, kept in monasteries, begins with [[vespers]] (see [[wiktionary:vesper|vesper]]), which is evening, in line with the other [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] traditions. Christian and planetary weekdays begin at the following midnight. Muslims gather for worship at a mosque at noon on \"gathering day\" ({{transl|ar|Yawm al-Jum\u2018ah}}, {{transl|ar|yawm}} {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0648\u0645}} meaning \"day\") which corresponds with Friday.\n\nThus \"gathering day\" is often regarded as the weekly day of rest. This is frequently made official, with many Muslim countries adopting Friday and Saturday (e.g., [[Egypt|Egypt, Saudi Arabia]]) or Thursday and Friday as official weekends, during which offices are closed; other countries (e.g., [[Iran]]) choose to make Friday alone a day of rest. A few others (e.g., [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]], [[Morocco]], [[Nigeria]]) have adopted the Saturday-Sunday weekend while making Friday a working day with a long midday break to allow time off for worship.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! \n!

Thus, according to Islamic tradition, [[Abraha]], governor of Yemen, then a province of the Christian [[Aksumite Empire|Kingdom of Aksum]] ([[Ethiopia]]), attempted to destroy the [[Kaaba]] with an army which included several elephants. The raid was unsuccessful, but that year became known as the ''[[Year of the Elephant]]'', during which Muhammad was born (sura [[al-Fil]]). Most equate this to the year 570 AD/CE, but a minority use 571 CE.\n\nThe first ten years of the Hijra were not numbered, but were named after events in the life of Muhammad according to [[Ab\u016b Ray\u1e25\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b]]:<ref>Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, [https://archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft ''Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars''] (1901) 376.</ref>\n# The year of permission.\n# The year of the order of fighting.\n# The year of the trial.\n# The year of congratulation on marriage.\n# The year of the earthquake.\n# The year of enquiring.\n# The year of gaining victory.\n# The year of equality.\n# The year of exemption.\n# The year of farewell.\n\nIn 17 AH (638 AD/CE), [[Abu Musa Ashaari]], one of the officials of the [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] in [[Basra]]h, complained about the absence of any years on the correspondence he received from Umar, making it difficult for him to determine which instructions were most recent. This report convinced Umar of the need to introduce an era for Muslims. After debating the issue with his counsellors, he decided that the first year should include the date of Muhammad's arrival at Medina (known as Yathrib, before Muhammad's arrival). [[Uthman ibn Affan]] then suggested that the months begin with Muharram, in line with the established custom of the Arabs at that time. The years of the Islamic calendar thus began with the month of Muharram in the year of Muhammad's arrival at the city of Medina, even though the actual emigration took place in Safar and Rabi' I.<ref name=\"WH\"/> Because of the Hijra, the calendar was named the Hijra calendar.\n\nThe first day of the first month of the Islamic calendar (1 Muharram 1 AH) was set to the first new moon after the day the Prophet moved from Quba' to Medina (originally 26 Rabi' I on the pre-Islamic calendar<ref>''Chronology of Prophetic Events'',  Fazlur Rehman Shaikh (2001) p.52 Ta-Ha Publishers Ltd.</ref>) i.e., Friday, 16 July 622 AD/CE, the equivalent civil tabular date (same daylight period) in the [[Julian calendar]].<ref>Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, [https://archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft ''Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars''] (1901) pp.373\u20135, 382\u20134.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html |title=Calendrica |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216102054/http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html |archivedate=16 February 2005 |df= }}</ref> The Islamic day began at the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July.

Still, the Islamic calendar seldom varies by more than three days from the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, and roughly approximates it.  Both the Islamic calendar and the astronomical-lunar-calendar take no account of the [[solar year]] in their calculations, and thus both of these strictly lunar based calendar systems have no ability to reckon the timing of the four seasons of the year.\n\nIn the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, a year of 12 lunar months is 354.37 days long.  In this calendar system, lunar months begin precisely at the time of the monthly \"conjunction\", when the Moon is located most directly between the Earth and the Sun. The month is defined as the average duration of a revolution of the Moon around the Earth (29.53 days). By convention, months of 30 days and 29 days succeed each other, adding up over two successive months to 59 full days. This leaves only a small monthly variation of 44 minutes to account for, which adds up to a total of 24 hours (i.e., the equivalent of one full day) in 2.73 years. To settle accounts, it is sufficient to add one day every three years to the lunar calendar, in the same way that one adds one day to the Gregorian calendar every four years.<ref>Emile Bi\u00e9mont, Rythmes du temps, Astronomie et calendriers, De Borck, 2000, 393p</ref> The technical details of the adjustment are described in [[Tabular Islamic calendar]].\n\nThe Islamic calendar, however, is based on a different set of conventions being used for the determination of the month-start-dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tabsir.net/?p=633#more-633|title=tabsir.net|publisher=}}</ref> Each month still has either 29 or 30 days, but due to the variable method of observations employed, there is usually in no discernible order in the sequencing of either 29 or 30 day month lengths. Traditionally, the first day of each month is the day (beginning at sunset) of the first sighting of the hilal (crescent moon) shortly after sunset. If the hilal is not observed immediately after the 29th day of a month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the day that begins at that sunset is the 30th. Such a sighting has to be made by one or more trustworthy men testifying before a committee of Muslim leaders. Determining the most likely day that the hilal could be observed was a motivation for Muslim interest in astronomy, which put Islam in the forefront of that science for many centuries.  Still, due to the fact that both lunar reckoning systems are ultimately based on the lunar cycle itself, both systems still do roughly correspond to one another, never being more than three days out of synch with one another.\n[[File:\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0647\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0636\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0642\u0645\u060c \u0639\u06a9\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c\u06cc\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0648\u06cc \u0642\u0645 12.jpg|alt=One man watches another, who looks through a modern telescope|thumb|Clerics observe the moon.]]\n\nThis traditional practice for the determination of the start-date of the month is still followed in the overwhelming majority of Muslim countries. Each Islamic state proceeds with its own monthly observation of the new moon (or, failing that, awaits the completion of 30 days) before declaring the beginning of a new month on its territory. But, the lunar crescent becomes visible only some 17 hours after the conjunction, and only subject to the existence of a number of favourable conditions relative to weather, time, geographic location, as well as various astronomical parameters.<ref>Karim Meziane et [[Nidhal Guessoum]]: La visibilit\u00e9 du croissant lunaire et le ramadan, La Recherche n\u00b0 316, janvier 1999, pp. 66\u201371</ref> Given the fact that the moon sets progressively later than the sun as one goes west, with a corresponding increase in its \"age\" since conjunction, Western Muslim countries may, under favorable conditions, observe the new moon one day earlier than eastern Muslim countries. Due to the interplay of all these factors, the beginning of each month differs from one Muslim country to another, during the 48 hour period following the conjunction. The information provided by the calendar in any country does not extend beyond the current month.\n\nA number of Muslim countries try to overcome some of these difficulties by applying different astronomy-related rules to determine the beginning of months. Thus, [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and a few others begin each month at sunset on the first day that the moon sets after the sun (moonset after sunset). In Egypt, the month begins at sunset on the first day that the moon sets at least five minutes after the sun.

This resulted in a division of the Muslim community of France, with some members following the new rule, and others following the Saudi announcement.\n\nIsma'ili-Taiyebi Bohras having the institution of ''[[Da'i al-Mutlaq|da'i al-mutlaq]]'' follow the tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) prepared on the basis of astronomical calculations from the days of [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] [[imam]]s.\n\n== Astronomical 12-moon calendars ==\n\n=== Islamic calendar of Turkey ===\nTurkish Muslims use an Islamic calendar which is calculated several years in advance (currently up to 1444 AH/2022 CE) by the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|Turkish Presidency of Religious Affairs]] (Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131). From 1 Muharrem 1400 AH (21 November 1979) until 29 Zilhicce 1435 (24 October 2014) the computed Turkish lunar calendar was based on the following rule: \"The lunar month is assumed to begin on the evening when, within some region of the terrestrial globe, the computed centre of the lunar crescent at local sunset is more than 5\u00b0 above the local horizon and (geocentrically) more than 8\u00b0 from the Sun.\" In the current rule the (computed) lunar crescent has to be above the local horizon of [[Ankara]] at sunset.<ref name=turkey>{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/diyanetcalendar.htm|title=The Islamic Calendar of Turkey|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Saudi Arabia's ''Umm al-Qura'' calendar ===\n[[Saudi Arabia]] uses the sighting method to determine the beginning of each month of the Hijri calendar. Since AH 1419 (1998/99), several official hilal sighting committees have been set up by the government to determine the first visual sighting of the lunar crescent at the beginning of each lunar month. Nevertheless, the religious authorities also allow the testimony of less experienced observers and thus often announce the sighting of the lunar crescent on a date when none of the official committees could see it.\n\nThe country also uses the Umm al-Qura calendar, based on astronomical calculations, but this is restricted to administrative purposes. The parameters used in the establishment of this calendar underwent significant changes over the past decade.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.icoproject.org/pdf/khan_2001.pdf |title=Crescent sighting using the Uml al Qura calendar in Saudi Arabia }}&nbsp;(268&nbsp;KB)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/ummalqura.htm|title=The Umm al-Qura Calendar of Saudi Arabia|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBefore AH 1420 (before 18 April 1999), if the moon's age at sunset in [[Riyadh]] was at least 12 hours, then the day ''ending'' at that sunset was the first day of the month. This often caused the Saudis to celebrate holy days one or even two days before other predominantly Muslim countries, including the dates for the Hajj, which can only be dated using Saudi dates because it is performed in Mecca.\n\nFor AH 1420\u201322, if moonset occurred after sunset at Mecca, then the day beginning at that sunset was the first day of a Saudi month, essentially the same rule used by Malaysia, Indonesia, and others (except for the location from which the hilal was observed).\n\nSince the beginning of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction of the sun and moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca. This ensures that the moon has moved past the sun by sunset, even though the sky may still be too bright immediately before moonset to actually see the crescent.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Islamic Society of North America]], the ''Fiqh'' Council of North America and the European Council for ''[[Fatwa]]'' and Research announced that they will henceforth use a calendar based on calculations using the same parameters as the ''Umm al-Qura'' calendar to determine (well in advance) the beginning of all lunar months (and therefore the days associated with all religious observances). This was intended as a first step on the way to unify, at some future time, Muslims' calendars throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://progmuslim.meetup.com/14/messages/boards/thread/3449676|title=Log in - Meetup|last=|first=|date=|website=progmuslim.meetup.com|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tabsir.net/?p=621#more-621|title=tabsir.net|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSince 1 October 2016, as a cost-cutting measure, Saudi Arabia no longer uses the Islamic calendar for paying the monthly salaries of government employees but the Gregorian calendar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglican.ink/article/saudi-arabia-adopts-gregorian-calendar|title=Saudi Arabia adopts Gregorian calendar|date=8 October 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=Economist171216>[https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21711938-hauling-saudi-arabia-21st-century-saudi-arabia-adopts-gregorian The prince\u2019s time machine: Saudi Arabia adopts the Gregorian calendar] [[The Economist]], Dec 17th 2016</ref>\n\n==Other calendars using the Islamic era==\nThe [[Solar Hijri calendar]] is a solar calendar used in Iran and Afghanistan which counts its years from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] or migration of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD/CE.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Tabular Islamic calendar ==\n{{main article|Tabular Islamic calendar}}\nThe Tabular Islamic calendar is a rule-based variation of the Islamic calendar, in which months are worked out by arithmetic rules rather than by observation or astronomical calculation.

It also deviates up to about one or two days in the short term.\n\n===Kuwaiti algorithm===\n{{main article|Tabular Islamic calendar#Kuwaiti algorithm}}\n[[Microsoft]] uses the \"Kuwaiti algorithm\", a variant of the tabular Islamic calendar,<ref>[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/islam_tabcal.htm#kuwait The \"Kuwaiti Algorithm\"] (Robert van Gent)</ref> to convert Gregorian dates to the Islamic ones. Microsoft claimed that the variant is based on a statistical analysis of historical data from [[Kuwait]], however it matches a known tabular calendar.\n\n== Notable dates ==\n{{main article|Muslim holidays}}\nImportant dates in the Islamic (Hijri) year are:\n* 1 Muharram: [[Islamic New Year]].\n* 10 Muharram: [[Day of Ashura]]. For Sunnis, the crossing of the [[Red Sea]] by [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]] occurred on this day. For both Shias and Sunnis, the martyrdom of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], the grandson of Muhammad, and his followers.\n* 12 Rabi al-Awwal: [[Mawlid]] or Birth of the Prophet for Sunnis.\n* 17 Rabi al-Awwal: [[Mawlid]] for Shias.\n* 27 Rajab: [[Isra and Mi'raj]] for the majority of Muslims.\n* 15 Sha'ban: [[Mid-Sha'ban]], or Night of Forgiveness.

(17 Ramadan in Indonesia and Malaysia)\n* Last third of Ramadan which includes [[Laylat al-Qadr]].\n* 1 Shawwal: [[Eid ul-Fitr]].\n* 8\u201313 Dhu al-Hijjah: The [[Hajj]] to Mecca.\n* 9 Dhu al-Hijjah: [[Day of Arafa]].\n* 10 Dhu al-Hijjah: [[Eid al-Adha]].\n\nDays considered important predominantly for Shia Muslims:\n* 13 Rajab: Birthday of [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]]\n* 21 Ramadan: Martyrdom of Ali ibn Abi Talib.\n* 3 Sha'ban: Birthday of [[Husayn ibn Ali]].\n* 9 Rabi' al-Awwal: [[Eid-e-Shuja']] (Revenge taken by [[Mukhtar al-Thaqafi]]).\n\nDays considered important for Sunni Muslims (especially in [[India]] & parts of [[Asia]]):\n* 6 Rajab: [[Urs]] of [[Moinuddin Chishti]]. Generally the sixth day of every month is celebrated and observed as ''Chatthi''.\n* 11 Rabi' al-Akhir: Urs of [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]]. Generally the 11th day of every month is celebrated and observed as ''Gyarvi''.\n\n== Converting Hijri to Gregorian date or vice versa ==\n[[File:Inscription of years by A.H.&A.D. eras.jpg|thumb|250px|Civil and Hijri establishment dates of a library in Old City, Jerusalem]]\nConversions may be made by using the [[Tabular Islamic calendar]], or, for greatest accuracy (one day in 15,186 years), via the Jewish calendar. Theoretically, the days of the months correspond in both calendars if the displacements which are a feature of the Jewish system are ignored. The table below gives, for nineteen years, the Muslim month which corresponds to the first Jewish month.\n\n{| style=\"border:none;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|style=\"padding-right:1.0em;\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

When it goes above twelve, subtract twelve and add one to the year AH. From 412 AD/CE to 632 AD/CE inclusive the month number is 1 and the calculation gives the month correct to a month or so. 622 AD/CE corresponds to BH1 and AH1. For earlier years, year BH = (623 or 622) \u2013 year AD/CE).\n\nAn example calculation: What is the civil date and year AH of the first day of the first month in the year 20875 AD/CE?\n\nWe first find the Muslim month number corresponding to the first month of the Jewish year which begins in 20874 AD/CE. Dividing 20874 by 19 gives quotient 1098 and remainder 12. Dividing 2026 by 19 gives quotient 106 and remainder 12. 2026 is chosen because it gives the same remainder on division by 19 as 20874. The two years are therefore (1098\u2013106)=992\u00d719 years apart. The Muslim month number corresponding to the first Jewish month is therefore 992\u00d77=6944 higher than in 2026. To convert into years and months divide by twelve \u2013 6944/12=578 years and 8 months. Adding, we get 1447y 10m + 20874y \u2013 2026y + 578y 8m = 20874y 6m. Therefore, the first month of the Jewish year beginning in 20874 AD/CE corresponds to the sixth month of the Muslim year AH20874. The worked example in [[Hebrew calendar#Conversion between Jewish and civil calendars|Conversion between Jewish and civil dates]], shows that the civil date of the first day of this month (ignoring the displacements) is Friday, 14 June. The year AH20875 will therefore begin seven months later, on the first day of the eighth Jewish month, which the worked example shows to be 7 January, 20875 AD/CE (again ignoring the displacements). The date given by this method, being calculated, may differ by a day from the actual date, which is determined by observation.\n\nA reading of the section which follows will show that the year AH20875 is wholly contained within the year 20875 AD/CE, also that in the Gregorian calendar this correspondence will occur one year earlier. The reason for the discrepancy is that the Gregorian year (like the Julian, though less so) is slightly too long, so the Gregorian date for a given AH date will be earlier and the Muslim calendar catches up sooner.\n<!----Mean civil year = 365d 05h 48m 48s (Milankovic), synodic month = 29d 12h 44 1/18m, hence mean calendar year = 354d 08h 48 12/18m.---->\n\n===Current correlations===\nAn Islamic year will be entirely within a Gregorian year of the same number in the year 20874, after which year the number of the Islamic year will always be greater than the number of the concurrent civil year. The Islamic calendar year of 1429 occurred entirely within the civil calendar year of 2008. Such years occur once every 33 or 34 Islamic years (32 or 33 civil years). More are listed here:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n!colspan=\"3\"| {{pad|1.0em}}Islamic year within civil year{{pad|1.0em}} </tr>\n| ''Islamic'' ||  ''Civil'' || ''Difference''\n|-\n| 1060 || 1650 || 590 </tr>\n| 1093 || 1682 || 589 </tr>\n| 1127 || 1715 || 588 </tr>\n| 1161 || 1748 || 587 </tr>\n| 1194 || 1780 || 586 </tr>\n| 1228 || 1813 || 585 </tr>\n| 1261 || 1845 || 584 </tr>\n| 1295 || 1878 || 583 </tr>\n| 1329 || 1911 || 582 </tr>\n| 1362 || 1943 || 581 </tr>\n| 1396 || 1976 || 580 </tr>\n| 1429 || 2008 || 579 </tr>\n| 1463 || 2041 || 578 </tr>\n| 1496 || 2073 || 577 </tr>\n| 1530 || 2106 || 576 </tr>\n| 1564 || 2139 || 575 </tr>\n|}\n\nBecause a Hijri or Islamic lunar year is between 10 and 12 days shorter than a civil year, it begins 10\u201312 days earlier in the civil year following the civil year in which the previous Hijri year began. Once every 33 or 34 Hijri years, or once every 32 or 33 civil years, the beginning of a Hijri year (1 Muharram) coincides with one of the first ten days of January. Subsequent Hijri New Years move backward through the civil year back to the beginning of January again, passing through each civil month from December to January.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe Islamic calendar is now used primarily for religious purposes, and for official dating of public events and documents in Muslim countries. Because of its nature as a purely lunar calendar, it cannot be used for agricultural purposes and historically Islamic communities have used other calendars for this purpose: the [[Egyptian calendar]] was formerly widespread in Islamic countries, and the [[Iranian calendars|Iranian calendar]] and the 1789 [[Rumi calendar|Ottoman calendar]] (a modified [[Julian calendar]]) were also used for agriculture in their countries.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In the [[Levant]] and [[Iraq]] the [[Aramaic]] names of the [[Babylonian calendar]] are still used for all secular matters.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In [[Morocco]], the [[Berber calendar]] (another Julian calendar) is still used by farmers in the countryside.<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite web |last1=Gast |first1=M. |last2=Delheur |first2=J. |last3=E.B. |title=Calendrier |url=http://journals.openedition.org/encyclopedieberbere/2039 |website=Encyclop\u00e9die Berb\u00e8re, 11 (Bracelets \u2013 Caprarienses) |publisher=OpenEdition |accessdate=5 July 2018 |language=fr}}</ref> These local solar calendars have receded in importance with the near-universal adoption of the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The Saudi Arabia uses the lunar Islamic calendar.<ref>the start of each lunar month determined not ahead of time by astronomical calculation, but only after the crescent moon is sighted by the proper religious authorities.

In other words, the IQR is the first quartile subtracted from the third quartile; these quartiles can be clearly seen on a [[box plot]] on the data. It is a [[trimmed estimator]], defined as the 25% trimmed [[range (statistics)|range]], and is a commonly used [[robust measures of scale|robust measure of scale]].\n\nThe IQR is a measure of variability, based on dividing a data set into quartiles. Quartiles divide a rank-ordered data set into four equal parts. The values that separate parts are called the first, second, and third quartiles; and they are denoted by Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively.\n\n==Use==\nUnlike total [[range (statistics)|range]], the interquartile range has a [[breakdown point]] of 25%,<ref>{{cite news |title=Explicit Scale Estimators with High Breakdown Point |first=Peter J. |last=Rousseeuw |first2=Christophe |last2=Croux |work=L1-Statistical Analysis and Related Methods |editor=Y.

If ''P'' is normally distributed, then the [[standard score]] of the first quartile, ''z''<sub>1</sub>, is -0.67, and the standard score of the third quartile, ''z''<sub>3</sub>, is +0.67. Given ''mean''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''X'' and ''standard&nbsp;deviation''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03c3 for ''P'', if ''P'' is normally distributed, the first quartile\n\n:<math>Q_1 = (\\sigma \\, z_1) + X</math>\n\nand the third quartile\n\n:<math>Q_3 = (\\sigma \\, z_3) + X</math>\n\nIf the actual values of the first or third quartiles differ substantially{{Clarify|date=December 2012}} from the calculated values, ''P'' is not normally distributed. However, a normal distribution can be trivially perturbed to maintain its Q1 and Q2 std. scores at 0.67 and -0.67 and not be normally distributed (so the above test would produce a false positive). A better test of normality, such as Q-Q plot would be indicated here.\n\n==Outliers==\n\n[[File:Box-Plot mit Interquartilsabstand.png|thumb|[[Box-and-whisker plot]] with four mild outliers and one extreme outlier.

Outliers here are defined as observations that fall below Q1 \u2212 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR. In a boxplot, the highest and lowest occurring value within this limit are indicated by ''whiskers'' of the box (frequently with an additional bar at the end of the whisker) and any outliers as individual points.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Midhinge]]\n* [[Interdecile range]]\n* [[Robust measures of scale]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Upton>{{cite book |title=Understanding Statistics |first1=Graham|last1=Upton|first2=Ian|last2= Cook|year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-914391-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vXzWG09_SzAC&pg=PA55&dq=interquartile+range#v=onepage&q=interquartile%20range&f=false}}</ref>\n<ref name= ZK>Zwillinger, D., Kokoska, S.

The character first appeared in the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', to be followed by ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' in 1984, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' in 1989, ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' from 1992 to 1996, and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' in 2008. The character is also featured in novels, comics, video games, and other media. Jones is also featured in several [[Disney]] theme parks, including the [[Indiana Jones Adventure]], [[Indiana Jones et le Temple du P\u00e9ril]], and ''[[Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!|Epic Stunt Spectacular!]]'' attractions.\n\nJones is most famously portrayed by [[Harrison Ford]] and has also been portrayed by [[River Phoenix]] (as the young Jones in ''The Last Crusade'') and in the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' by [[Corey Carrier]], [[Sean Patrick Flanery]], and [[George Hall (actor)|George Hall]].

He also attended the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nIn this first adventure, he is pitted against [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] commissioned by Hitler to recover artifacts of great power from the Old Testament (see [[Nazi archaeology]]). In consequence, Dr Jones travels the world to prevent them from recovering the [[Ark of the Covenant]] (see also [[Biblical archaeology]]). He is aided by [[Marion Ravenwood]] and [[Sallah]]. The Nazis are led by Jones's archrival, a Nazi-sympathizing French archaeologist named Ren\u00e9 Belloq, and Arnold Toht, a sinister [[Gestapo]] agent.\n\nIn the 1984 prequel, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', set in 1935, Jones travels to India and attempts to free enslaved children and the three Sankara stones from the bloodthirsty [[Thuggee]] cult. He is aided by [[Short Round]], a young boy, and is accompanied by singer Willie Scott ([[Kate Capshaw]]).\n\nThe third film, 1989's ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', set in 1938, returned to the formula of the original, reintroducing characters such as [[Sallah]] and [[Marcus Brody]], a scene from Professor Jones's classroom (he now teaches at [[Barnett College]]), the globe trotting element of multiple locations, and the return of the infamous [[Nazi mysticism|Nazi mystics]], this time trying to find the [[Holy Grail]]. The film's introduction, set in 1912, provided some back story to the character, specifically the origin of his fear of snakes, his use of a [[bullwhip]], the scar on his chin, and his hat; the film's epilogue also reveals that \"Indiana\" is not Jones's first name, but a nickname he took from the family dog. The film was a [[buddy movie]] of sorts, teaming Jones with his father, [[Henry Jones, Sr.]], often to comical effect. Although Lucas intended to make five Indiana Jones films, ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' was the last for over eighteen years, as he could not think of a good [[MacGuffin|plot element]] to drive the next installment.<ref name=\"race against time\">{{cite news|author1=Nick de Semlyen |author2=Ian Freer |author3=Chris Hewitt |author4=Ian Nathan |author5=Sam Toy |title=A Race Against Time: Indiana Jones IV|page=100|publisher=''Empire''|date=2006-09-29}}</ref>\n\nThe 2008 film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', is the latest film in the series. Set in 1957, 19 years after the third film, it pits an older, wiser Indiana Jones against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agents bent on harnessing the power of an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] device discovered in South America.

[[Indiana Jones et le Temple du P\u00e9ril|''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril'']] is a looping roller coaster engineered by [[Intamin]], designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, and opened in 1993.\n\nThe ''[[Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!]]'' is a live show that has been presented in the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] theme park of the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] with few changes since the park's 1989 opening, as Disney-MGM Studios. The 25-minute show presents various stunts framed in the context of a feature film production, and recruits members of the audience to participate in the show. Stunt artists in the show re-create and ultimately reveal some of the secrets of the stunts of the ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' films, including the well-known \"running-from-the-boulder\" scene.

Indy also appears in a series of Marvel Comics.\n\n====Movie tie-in novelizations====\nThe four Indiana Jones film scripts were novelized and published in the time-frame of the films' initial releases.<ref>All titles, authors, dates of publication, and publishers of these novelizations are from the title and copyright pages of the first editions of each of the cited volumes.</ref> ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' was novelized by Campbell Black based on the script by Lawrence Kasdan that was based on the story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman and published in April 1981 by Ballantine Books; ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' was novelized by James Kahn and based on the script by Willard Huyck & Gloria Katz that was based on the story by George Lucas and published May 1984 by Ballantine Books; ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' was novelized by Rob MacGregor based on the script by Jeffrey Boam that was based on a story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes and published June 1989 by Ballantine Books. Nearly 20 years later ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' was novelized by James Rollins based on the script by David Koepp based on the story by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson and published May 2008 by Ballantine Books. In addition, in 2008 to accompany the release of ''Kingdom of Skulls'', Scholastic Books published juvenile novelizations of the four scripts written, successively in the order above, by Ryder Windham, Suzanne Weyn, Ryder Windham, and James Luceno. All these books have been reprinted, with ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' being retitled ''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark''. While these are the principal titles and authors, there are numerous other volumes derived from the four film properties.\n\n====Original novels====\nFrom February 1991 through February 1999, twelve original Indiana Jones-themed adult novels were licensed by Lucasfilm, Ltd. and written by three genre authors of the period. Ten years afterward, a thirteenth original novel was added, also written by a popular genre author. The first twelve were published by Bantam Books; the last by Ballantine Books in 2009.

One episode, \"Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues\", is bookended by Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, rather than Hall. Later episodes and telemovies did not have this bookend format.\n\nThe bulk of the series centers around the young adult Indiana Jones and his activities during [[World War I]] as a 16- to 17-year-old soldier in the Belgian Army and then as an intelligence officer and spy seconded to French intelligence. The child Indy episodes follow the boy's travels around the globe as he accompanies his parents on his father's worldwide lecture tour from 1908 to 1910.\n\nThe show provided some backstory for the films, as well as new information regarding the character. Indiana Jones was born July 1, 1899, and his middle name is Walton (Lucas's middle name). It is also mentioned that he had a sister called Suzie who died as an infant of fever, and that he eventually has a daughter and grandchildren who appear in some episode introductions and epilogues. His relationship with his father, first introduced in ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'', was further fleshed out with stories about his travels with his father as a young boy. Indy damages or loses his right eye sometime between the events in [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|1957]] and the early 1990s, when the \"Old Indy\" segments take place, as the elderly Indiana Jones wears an eyepatch.\n\nIn 1999, Lucas removed the episode introductions and epilogues by George Hall for the VHS and DVD releases, and re-edited the episodes into chronologically ordered feature-length stories. The series title was also changed to ''The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones''.\n\n===Video games===\nThe character has appeared in several officially licensed games, beginning with adaptations of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark (Atari 2600)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1985 video game)|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', two adaptations of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (video game)|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (one with purely action mechanics, one with an adventure and puzzle based structure) and ''[[Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures]]'', which included the storylines from all three of the original films.\n\nFollowing this, the games branched off into original storylines with Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucasarts.com/games/indianajones/|title=Indiana Jones|publisher=Lucas Arts|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> ''Emperor's Tomb'' sets up Jones's companion Wu Han and the search for [[Nurhaci]]'s ashes seen at the beginning of ''Temple of Doom''. The first two games were developed by [[Hal Barwood]] and starred Doug Lee as the voice of Indiana Jones; ''Emperor's Tomb'' had David Esch fill the role and ''Staff of Kings'' starred John Armstrong.\n\n''[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]'' was the first Indy-based game presented in three dimensions, as opposed to 8-bit graphics and side-scrolling games before.\n\nThere is also a small game from Lucas Arts ''[[Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures]]''. A video game was made for young Indy called ''Young Indiana Jones and the Instruments of Chaos'', as well as a video game version of ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]''.\n\nTwo [[Lego]] Indiana Jones games have also been released. ''[[Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures]]'' was released in 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucasarts.com/games/legoindianajones/|title=LEGO Indiana Jones|publisher=Lucas Arts|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> and follows the plots of the first three films. It was followed by ''[[Lego Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues]]'' in late 2009. The sequel includes an abbreviated reprise of the first three films, but focuses on the plot of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''.\n\nSocial gaming company [[Zynga]] introduced Indiana Jones to their \"[[Indiana Jones Adventure World|Adventure World]]\" game in late 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewinski|first=John Scott|title=Indiana Jones raids Zynga's Adventure World|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57335066-1/indiana-jones-raids-zyngas-adventure-world/|accessdate=21 December 2012|newspaper=c{{!}}net|date=1 December 2011|location=San Francisco CA}}</ref>\n\n==Character description and formation==\n[[File:Indianajones4.jpg|left|thumb|[[Harrison Ford]] as the mature Jones in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008).]]\n\n\"Indiana\" Jones's full name is Dr. Henry Walton Jones Jr.,<ref>The character's full name is stated in the [[Corey Carrier]] narration of the feature-length episode ''My First Adventure'' from ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]].''</ref> and his nickname is often shortened to \"Indy\".\n\nIn his role as a college professor of archaeology, Jones is scholarly and learned in a tweed suit, lecturing on ancient civilizations.

[[Carl Barks]] created Scrooge in 1948 as a one-off relation for [[Donald Duck]] in the patter's self-titled comic book.<ref>\"Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times\" Celestial Arts Press, Millbrae, Califormia, p.23, 1981. \"These four panels, from pages one and two of CHRISTMAS ON BEAR MOUNTAIN (1948), are the very first appearance of Scrooge McDuck. His Dickensian and Scottish origins are apparent in his demeanor and costume. Scrooge gradually evolved into a less stereotypical and more complex character.\"</ref> Barks realized that the character had more potential, so a separate ''Uncle Scrooge'' comic book series full of exciting and strange adventures in the company of his duck nephews was developed. This ''Uncle Scrooge'' comic series strongly influenced George Lucas.<ref>George Lucas in \u2033An Appreciation\u2033 in \"Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times\" Celestial Arts Press, Millbrae, Califormia, 1981. \u2033Some of the very first comics I obtained were written by Carl Barks. I had a subscription to \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" and liked the Scrooge character so much that I immediately went out and bought all the Uncle Scrooge comics I could find on the newsstand... The stories are...cinematic.\"</ref> This appreciation of Scrooge as an adventurer influenced the development of Jones in clear and obvious ways. For example, the prolog of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" contains an homage to Barks' Scrooge adventure \u2033The Seven Cities of Cibola\u2033 published in ''Uncle Scrooge'' # 7 from September 1954.<ref>\"Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times\" Celestial Arts Press, Millbrae, Califormia, 1981.</ref> This homage in the film takes the form of playfully mimicking the removal-of-the-statuette-from-its-pedestal and the falling-stone sequences of the comic book.<ref>http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/12/13/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-133/</ref><ref>Stefano Priarone in Walt Disney's Uncle $crooge: The Seven Cities of Gold, Fantagraphics Books, 2014. \u2033Uncle Scrooge takes Donald and the nephews on a perilous trek in search of the fabled seven cities of gold!

As a documentary of ''Raiders'' pointed out, the hat served a practical purpose. Following the lead of the old \"B\"-movies that inspired the ''Indiana Jones'' series, the fedora hid the actor's face sufficiently to allow doubles to perform the more dangerous stunts seamlessly. Examples in ''Raiders'' include the wider-angle shot of Indy and Marion crashing a statue through a wall, and Indy sliding under a fast-moving vehicle from front to back. Thus it was necessary for the hat to stay in place much of the time.\n\nThe hat became so iconic that the filmmakers could only come up with very good reasons or jokes to remove it. If it ever fell off during a take, filming would have to stop to put it back on. In jest, Ford put a stapler against his head to stop his hat from falling off when a documentary crew visited during shooting of ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''. This created the urban legend that Ford stapled the hat to his head.<ref>{{cite web | title=Hat and Jacket featurette | publisher=Official site | date=2008-02-08 | url=http://www.indianajones.com/site/?deeplink=videos/1/v28 | accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref> Anytime Indy's hat accidentally came off as part of the storyline (blown off by the wind, knocked off, etc.) and seemed almost irretrievable, filmmakers would make sure Indy and his hat were always reunited, regardless of the implausibility of its return. Although other hats were also used throughout the films, the general style and profile remained the same. Elements of the outfit include:\n* The fedora was supplied by [[Herbert Johnson (hatters)|Herbert Johnson Hatters]] in England for the first three films.<ref>[http://www.herbert-johnson.co.uk/history.html Herbert Johnson Hatters website] Retrieved July 2, 2018.</ref> An Australian model was used by costume designer Deborah Landis to show hat maker Richard Swales the details when making the iconic hat from \"the Poets\" parts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.indygear.com/igfedora.html | title=The Indiana Jones Fedora | work=Indy Gear | accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref> The fedora for ''Crystal Skull'' was made by Steve Delk and Marc Kitter of the Adventurebilt Hat Company of Columbus, Mississippi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventurebilthats.com/indy.asp|title=Adventurebilt and Indiana Jones|publisher=Adventurebilt Hat Company|accessdate=2013-01-05}}</ref>\n* The leather jacket, a hybrid of the \"Type 440\" and the [[A-2 jacket]], was made by Leather Concessionaires (now known as Wested Leather Co.) for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''. For ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'', jackets were made in-house at Bermans & Nathans in London based on a stunt jacket they provided for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. Tony Nowak made the jacket for ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Indiana Jones Jacket: The Last Crusade|url=http://www.indygear.com/igjacket-LC.html|website=Indy Gear: The Indiana Jones Equipment Resource|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n* The Indiana Jones shirt is based on a typical safari-style shirt. Its distinctive feature is two vertical strips running from the shoulders to the bottom of the shirt tails and continued over both breast pockets. A common debate regards the original shirt color. Surviving samples of the original shirts seem to be darker in reality than they appear on screen. Most fans look for an off-white \"stone\" color for their replicas. The original shirts, however, may have been more of a \"tan\" or \"natural\" color. The shirt varied little from film to film, the only notable difference being the darker buttons in ''Temple of Doom'' and ''Last Crusade''. Originally designed by Andreas Dometakis for the films, this shirt was once one of the hardest pieces of gear to find.\n* The trousers worn by Indiana Jones in all three films were based on original World War II Army and Army Air Corps officer trousers. Although not original Pinks they are based on the same basic design and do carry a slight pinkish hue. The trousers made for ''Raiders'' are said to be more of a greyish-brown whereas the trousers made for ''Temple of Doom'' and ''Last Crusade'' were supposedly a purer reddish brown. The trousers were made of a khaki wool-twill, pleated with seven belt loops, two scalloped button flap rear pockets, a button fly and a four-inch military style hem. They were all most likely subcontracted by the costume department and made by famed London based cinema costumers, Angels and Bermans, to be tailored perfectly for Harrison Ford for the production.\n* The [[satchel]] was a modified Mark VII [[gas mask]] bag that was used by British troops and civilians during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"TheRaider.net\"/>\n* The whip was an {{convert|8|to|10|foot|m}} [[bullwhip]] crafted by David Morgan for the first three films. The whips for ''Crystal Skull'' were crafted by a variety of people, including Terry Jacka, Joe Strain and Morgan (different lengths and styles were likely used in specific stunts).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n* The pistol was usually a [[World War I]]-era revolver, including the [[Webley Revolver|Webley]] Government (WG) Revolver (''Last Crusade'' and ''Crystal Skull''), or a [[Smith & Wesson]] Second Model Hand Ejector revolver (''Raiders''). He has also used a [[Colt Official Police]] revolver (''Temple of Doom''), a [[Nagant M1883]] (''Young Indiana Jones''), and a 9&nbsp;mm [[Browning Hi-Power]] (''Raiders'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indygear.com/igguns.html|title=Indiana Jones Guns|publisher=IndyGear.com|accessdate=2008-07-02}}</ref> The weapon is carried in a military pattern flap holster.\n* The shoes were made by [[Alden Shoe Company|Alden]].

Shortly afterward [[pre-production]] began in earnest on ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.<ref name=\"makingraiders\"/> However, [[CBS]] refused to release Selleck from his contractual commitment to ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' (which was gradually gaining momentum in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]), forcing him to turn down the role.<ref name=\"makingraiders\"/> One of CBS's concerns was that shooting for ''Magnum P.I.'' conflicted with shooting for ''Raiders'', both of which were to begin about the same time. However, Selleck was to say later in an interview that shooting for ''Magnum P.I.'' was delayed and did not actually begin until shooting for ''Raiders'' had concluded.\n\nSubsequently, both [[Peter Coyote]] and [[Tim Matheson]] auditioned for the role. However, after Spielberg suggested Ford again, Lucas relented, and Ford was cast in the role less than three weeks before filming began.<ref name=\"makingraiders\"/>\n\n==Cultural impact==\n\n===Archaeological influence===\nThe industry magazine ''Archaeology'' named eight past and present archaeologists who they felt \"embodied [Jones'] spirit\" as recipients of the Indy Spirit Awards in 2008.<ref name=\"The New Yorker\">{{cite news|last1=Peed|first1=Mike|title=Digging: Archaeologists and \"Indiana Jones\"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/09/digging|publisher=The New Yorker|date=June 9, 2008}}</ref> That same year Ford himself was elected to the Board of Directors for the Archaeological Institute of America.

Since the release of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' in 1981, the very idea of archaeology and archaeologists has fundamentally shifted.

In the early years of films involving archaeologists, they were portrayed as victims who would need to be rescued by a more masculine or heroic figure.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=McGeough|first1=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|date=2006}}</ref> Following 1981, the stereotypical archaeologist is thought of as a male bullwhip-wielding adventurer and [[Ivy League]] professor.

In case a denominator and numerator remain that are too large to ensure they are coprime by inspection, a greatest common divisor computation is needed anyway to ensure the fraction is actually irreducible.\n\n==Uniqueness==\n\nEvery rational number has a ''unique'' representation as an irreducible fraction with a positive denominator<ref name=\"unique\"/> (however <math>\\tfrac{2}{3} = \\tfrac{-2}{-3}</math> although both are irreducible). Uniqueness is a consequence of the [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic|unique prime factorization]] of integers, since <math>\\tfrac{a}{b} = \\tfrac{c}{d}</math> implies ''ad'' = ''bc'' and so both sides of the latter must share the same prime factorization, yet <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> share no prime factors so the set of prime factors of <math>a</math> (with multiplicity) is a subset of those of <math>c</math> and vice versa meaning <math>a=c</math> and <math>b=d</math>.\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe fact that any rational number has a unique representation as an irreducible fraction is utilized in various [[Square root of 2#Proofs of irrationality|proofs of the irrationality of the square root of 2]] and of other irrational numbers. For example, one proof notes that if the square root of 2 could be represented as a ratio of integers, then it would have in particular the fully reduced representation <math>\\tfrac{a}{b}</math> where ''a'' and ''b'' are the smallest possible; but given that <math>\\tfrac{a}{b}</math> equals the square root of 2, so does <math>\\tfrac{2b-a}{a-b}</math> (since cross-multiplying this with <math>\\tfrac{a}{b}</math> shows that they are equal). Since the latter is a ratio of smaller integers, this is a [[proof by contradiction|contradiction]], so the premise that the square root of two has a representation as the ratio of two integers is false.\n\n==Generalization==\n\nThe notion of irreducible fraction generalizes to the [[field of fractions]] of any [[unique factorization domain]]: any element of such a field can be written as a fraction in which denominator and numerator are coprime, by dividing both by their greatest common divisor.<ref>{{citation|title=Abstract Algebra|first=Paul B.|last=Garrett|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=9781584886907|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZzSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA183}}.</ref> This applies notably to [[rational fraction|rational expressions]] over a field. The irreducible fraction for a given element is unique up to multiplication of denominator and numerator by the same invertible element. In the case of the rational numbers this means that any number has two irreducible fractions, related by a change of sign of both numerator and denominator; this ambiguity can be removed by requiring the denominator to be positive. In the case of rational functions the denominator could similarly be required to be a [[monic polynomial]].<ref>{{citation|title=Abstract Algebra|volume=242|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first=Pierre Antoine|last=Grillet|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=9780387715681|at=Lemma 9.2, p.&nbsp;183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZzSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA183}}.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Anomalous cancellation]], an erroneous arithmetic procedure that produces the correct irreducible fraction by cancelling digits of the original unreduced form\n*[[Diophantine approximation]], the approximation of real numbers by rational numbers.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathWorld |title=Reduced Fraction |id=ReducedFraction}}\n\n{{Fractions and ratios}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Irreducible Fraction}}\n[[Category:Fractions (mathematics)]]\n[[Category:Elementary arithmetic]]", "sha1": "ojwu1dy6nzshl3d1xrhsbb3tiu4kjuf"}}, {"title": "Information Theory", "ns": "0", "id": "14824", "redirect": {"title": "Information theory"}, "revision": {"id": "783864269", "parentid": "290579974", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T04:07:23Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Information theory]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from other capitalisation}}\n}}", "sha1": "bye6gjz6pl6uxfsbco541wogy287jn7"}}, {"title": "Isomorphism class", "ns": "0", "id": "14826", "revision": {"id": "727624236", "parentid": "727517985", "timestamp": "2016-06-30T05:11:41Z", "contributor": {"username": "Yobot", "id": "7328338"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[WP:CHECKWIKI]] error fixes using [[Project:AWB|AWB]] (12041)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2016}}\nAn '''isomorphism class''' is a collection of [[mathematical object]]s [[isomorphic]] to each other.<ref>{{cite book|author=Awodey, Steve|chapter=Isomorphisms|title=Category theory|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780198568612|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IK_sIDI2TCwC&pg=PA11}}</ref>\n\nIsomorphism classes are often defined if the exact identity of the elements of the set is considered irrelevant, and the properties of the structure of the mathematical object are studied.  Examples of this are [[ordinal number|ordinals]] and [[graph theory|graphs]].  However, there are circumstances in which the isomorphism class of an object conceals vital internal information about it; consider these examples:\n* The [[associative algebras]] consisting of [[coquaternion]]s and [[2 \u00d7 2 real matrices]] are isomorphic as [[ring theory|rings]]. Yet they appear in different contexts for application (plane mapping and kinematics) so the isomorphism is insufficient to merge the concepts.\n*In [[homotopy theory]], the [[fundamental group]] of a space <math>X</math> at a point <math>p</math>, though technically denoted <math>\\pi_1(X,p)</math> to emphasize the dependence on the base point, is often written lazily as simply <math>\\pi_1(X)</math> if <math>X</math> is [[connected space#Path connectedness|path connected]].  The reason for this is that the existence of a path between two points allows one to identify loops at one with loops at the other; however, unless <math>\\pi_1(X,p)</math> is [[abelian group|abelian]] this isomorphism is non-unique.  Furthermore, the classification of [[covering space]]s makes strict reference to particular subgroups of <math>\\pi_1(X,p)</math>, specifically distinguishing between isomorphic but [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] subgroups, and therefore amalgamating the elements of an isomorphism class into a single featureless object seriously decreases the level of detail provided by the theory.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Isomorphism Class}}\n[[Category:Abstract algebra]]", "sha1": "3g51jakaawr3uwjqhw51rkhl532kuk4"}}, {"title": "Isomorphic", "ns": "0", "id": "14827", "redirect": {"title": "Isomorphism"}, "revision": {"id": "783865645", "parentid": "757139357", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T04:23:05Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[isomorphism]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from adjective}}\n}}", "sha1": "l1er8ynw4921zy7jg9r04aphpp4yyuj"}}, {"title": "Isomorphism", "ns": "0", "id": "14828", "revision": {"id": "849362825", "parentid": "849358790", "timestamp": "2018-07-08T13:15:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "D.Lazard", "id": "12336988"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/2600:1017:B819:38DD:7CBD:C773:1567:84FA|2600:1017:B819:38DD:7CBD:C773:1567:84FA]] ([[User talk:2600:1017:B819:38DD:7CBD:C773:1567:84FA|talk]]) to last revision by Bear-rings.

Two [[mathematical object]]s are '''isomorphic''' if an isomorphism exists between them.  An ''[[automorphism]]'' is an isomorphism whose source and target coincide.  The interest of isomorphisms lies in the fact that two isomorphic objects cannot be distinguished by using only the properties used to define morphisms; thus isomorphic objects may be considered the same as long as one considers only these properties and their consequences.\n\nFor most [[algebraic structure]]s, including [[group (mathematics)|group]]s and [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, a homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is [[bijective]].\n\nIn [[topology]], where the morphisms are [[continuous function]]s, isomorphisms are also called ''[[homeomorphism]]s'' or ''bicontinuous functions''. In [[mathematical analysis]], where the morphisms are [[differentiable function]]s, isomorphisms are also called ''[[diffeomorphism]]s''.\n\nA '''canonical isomorphism''' is a [[canonical map]] that is an isomorphism. Two objects are said to be '''canonically isomorphic''' if there is a canonical isomorphism between them. For example, the canonical map from a finite-dimensional vector space ''V'' to its second dual space is a canonical isomorphism; on the other hand, ''V'' is isomorphic to its dual space but not canonically in general.\n\nIsomorphisms are formalized using [[category theory]].  A morphism {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} in a category is an isomorphism if it admits a two-sided inverse, meaning that there is another morphism {{nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X''}} in that category such that {{nowrap|''gf'' {{=}} 1<sub>''X''</sub>}} and {{nowrap|''fg'' {{=}} 1<sub>''Y''</sub>}}, where 1<sub>''X''</sub> and 1<sub>''Y''</sub> are the identity morphisms of ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively.<ref>{{cite book|author=Awodey, Steve|chapter=Isomorphisms|title=Category theory|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780198568612|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IK_sIDI2TCwC&pg=PA11}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==<!-- This section is linked from [[List of small groups]] -->\n\n===Logarithm and exponential===\nLet <math>\\mathbb{R}^+</math> be the multiplicative group of [[positive real numbers]], and let <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> be the additive group of real numbers.\n\nThe [[logarithm function]] <math>\\log \\colon \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> satisfies <math>\\log(xy) = \\log x + \\log y</math> for all <math>x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}^+</math>, so it is a [[group homomorphism]].

Since <math>\\log</math> is a homomorphism that has an inverse that is also a homomorphism, <math>\\log</math> is an isomorphism of groups.\n\nBecause <math>\\log</math> is an isomorphism, it translates multiplication of positive real numbers into addition of real numbers.

In algebraic categories (specifically, categories of [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties in the sense of universal algebra]]), an isomorphism is the same as a homomorphism which is bijective on underlying sets.  However, there are concrete categories in which bijective morphisms are not necessarily isomorphisms (such as the category of topological spaces), and there are categories in which each object admits an underlying set but in which isomorphisms need not be bijective (such as the homotopy category of CW-complexes).\n\n==Applications==\nIn [[abstract algebra]], two basic isomorphisms are defined:\n* [[Group isomorphism]], an isomorphism between [[group (mathematics)|groups]]\n* [[Ring isomorphism]], an isomorphism between [[ring (mathematics)|rings]]. (Isomorphisms between [[field (mathematics)|fields]] are actually ring isomorphisms)\n\nJust as the [[automorphism]]s of an [[algebraic structure]] form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], the isomorphisms between two algebras sharing a common structure form a [[heap (mathematics)|heap]]. Letting a particular isomorphism identify the two structures turns this heap into a group.\n\nIn [[mathematical analysis]], the [[Laplace transform]] is an isomorphism mapping hard [[differential equations]] into easier [[algebra]]ic equations.\n\nIn [[category theory]], let the [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' consist of two [[class (set theory)|classes]], one of ''objects'' and the other of [[morphisms]]. Then a general definition of isomorphism that covers the previous and many other cases is: an isomorphism is a morphism {{nowrap|1=\u0192: ''a'' \u2192 ''b''}} that has an inverse, i.e. there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=''g'': ''b'' \u2192 ''a''}} with {{nowrap|1=''\u0192g'' = 1<sub>''b''</sub>}} and {{nowrap|1=''g\u0192'' = 1<sub>''a''</sub>}}. For example, a bijective [[linear map]] is an isomorphism between [[vector space]]s, and a bijective [[continuous function]] whose inverse is also continuous is an isomorphism between [[topological space]]s, called a [[homeomorphism]].\n\nIn [[graph theory]], an isomorphism between two graphs ''G'' and ''H'' is a [[bijective]] map ''f'' from the vertices of ''G'' to the vertices of ''H'' that preserves the \"edge structure\" in the sense that there is an edge from [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] ''u'' to vertex ''v'' in ''G'' if and only if there is an edge from \u0192(''u'') to \u0192(''v'') in ''H''. See [[graph isomorphism]].\n\nIn mathematical analysis, an isomorphism between two [[Hilbert spaces]] is a bijection preserving addition, scalar multiplication, and inner product.\n\nIn early theories of [[logical atomism]], the formal relationship between facts and true propositions was theorized by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] to be isomorphic. An example of this line of thinking can be found in Russell's ''[[Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy]]''.\n\nIn [[cybernetics]], the [[good regulator]] or Conant\u2013Ashby theorem is stated \"Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system\". Whether regulated or self-regulating, an isomorphism is required between the regulator and processing parts of the system.\n\n==Relation with equality==\n{{See also|Equality (mathematics)}}\n\nIn certain areas of mathematics, notably [[category theory]], it is valuable to distinguish between ''[[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]'' on the one hand and ''isomorphism'' on the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mazur|2007}}</ref> Equality is when two objects are exactly the same, and everything that's true about one object is true about the other, while an isomorphism implies everything that's true about a designated part of one object's structure is true about the other's. For example, the sets\n:<math>A = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid x^2 < 2\\}</math> and <math>B = \\{-1, 0, 1\\} \\,</math>\nare ''equal''; they are merely different representations\u2014the first an [[intensional definition|intensional]] one (in [[set builder notation]]), and the second [[extensional definition|extensional]] (by explicit enumeration)\u2014of the same subset of the integers. By contrast, the sets {''A'',''B'',''C''} and {1,2,3} are not ''equal''\u2014the first has elements that are letters, while the second has elements that are numbers. These are isomorphic as sets, since finite sets are determined up to isomorphism by their [[cardinality]] (number of elements) and these both have three elements, but there are many choices of isomorphism\u2014one isomorphism is\n:<math>\\text{A} \\mapsto 1, \\text{B} \\mapsto 2, \\text{C} \\mapsto 3,</math> while another is <math>\\text{A} \\mapsto 3, \\text{B} \\mapsto 2, \\text{C} \\mapsto 1,</math>\nand no one isomorphism is intrinsically better than any other.<ref group=\"note\">''A'', ''B'', ''C'' have a conventional order, namely alphabetical order, and similarly 1, 2, 3 have the order from the integers, and thus one particular isomorphism is \"natural\", namely\n:<math>\\text{A} \\mapsto 1, \\text{B} \\mapsto 2, \\text{C} \\mapsto 3</math>.\nMore formally, as ''sets'' these are isomorphic, but not naturally isomorphic (there are multiple choices of isomorphism), while as ''ordered sets'' they are naturally isomorphic (there is a unique isomorphism, given above), since [[finite total order]]s are uniquely determined up to unique isomorphism by [[cardinality]].\n\nThis intuition can be formalized by saying that any two finite [[totally ordered set]]s of the same cardinality have a natural isomorphism, the one that sends the [[least element]] of the first to the least element of the second, the least element of what remains in the first to the least element of what remains in the second, and so forth, but in general, pairs of sets of a given finite cardinality are not naturally isomorphic because there is more than one choice of map\u2014except if the cardinality is 0 or 1, where there is a unique choice.</ref><ref group=\"note\">In fact, there are precisely <math>3! = 6</math> different isomorphisms between two sets with three elements. This is equal to the number of [[automorphism]]s of a given three-element set (which in turn is equal to the order of the [[symmetric group]] on three letters), and more generally one has that the set of isomorphisms between two objects, denoted <math>\\operatorname{Iso}(A,B),</math> is a [[torsor]] for the automorphism group of ''A,'' <math>\\operatorname{Aut}(A)</math> and also a torsor for the automorphism group of ''B.'' In fact, automorphisms of an object are a key reason to be concerned with the distinction between isomorphism and equality, as demonstrated in the effect of change of basis on the identification of a vector space with its dual or with its double dual, as elaborated in the sequel.</ref> On this view and in this sense, these two sets are not equal because one cannot consider them ''identical'': one can choose an isomorphism between them, but that is a weaker claim than identity\u2014and valid only in the context of the chosen isomorphism.\n\nSometimes the isomorphisms can seem obvious and compelling, but are still not equalities. As a simple example, the [[genealogy|genealogical]] relationships among [[Joseph Kennedy|Joe]], [[John F. Kennedy|John]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy|Bobby]] Kennedy are, in a real sense, the same as those among the [[American football]] [[quarterbacks]] in the Manning family: [[Archie Manning|Archie]], [[Peyton Manning|Peyton]], and [[Eli Manning|Eli]]. The father-son pairings and the elder-brother-younger-brother pairings correspond perfectly. That similarity between the two family structures illustrates the origin of the word ''isomorphism'' (Greek ''iso''-, \"same,\" and -''morph'', \"form\" or \"shape\"). But because the Kennedys are not the same people as the Mannings, the two genealogical structures are merely isomorphic and not equal.\n\nAnother example is more formal and more directly illustrates the motivation for distinguishing equality from isomorphism: the distinction between a [[finite-dimensional vector space]] ''V'' and its [[dual space]] {{nowrap|1=''V''* = { \u03c6: V \u2192 '''K''' }}} of linear maps from ''V'' to its field of scalars '''K'''.\nThese spaces have the same dimension, and thus are isomorphic as abstract vector spaces (since algebraically, vector spaces are classified by dimension, just as sets are classified by cardinality), but there is no \"natural\" choice of isomorphism <math>\\scriptstyle V \\, \\overset{\\sim}{\\to} \\, V^*</math>.\nIf one chooses a basis for ''V'', then this yields an isomorphism: For all {{nowrap|1=''u''. ''v'' \u2208 ''V''}},\n:<math>v \\ \\overset{\\sim}{\\mapsto} \\ \\phi_v \\in V^* \\quad \\text{such that} \\quad \\phi_v(u) = v^\\mathrm{T} u</math>.\n\nThis corresponds to transforming a [[column vector]] (element of ''V'') to a [[row vector]] (element of ''V''*) by [[transpose]], but a different choice of basis gives a different isomorphism: the isomorphism \"depends on the choice of basis\".\nMore subtly, there ''is'' a map from a vector space ''V'' to its [[double dual]] {{nowrap|1= ''V''** = { ''x'': ''V''* \u2192 '''K''' }}} that does not depend on the choice of basis: For all {{nowrap|1=''v'' \u2208 ''V'' and \u03c6 \u2208 ''V''*,}}\n:<math>v \\ \\overset{\\sim}{\\mapsto} \\ x_v \\in V^{**} \\quad \\text{such that} \\quad x_v(\\phi) = \\phi(v)</math>.\n\nThis leads to a third notion, that of a [[natural isomorphism]]: while ''V'' and ''V''** are different sets, there is a \"natural\" choice of isomorphism between them.\nThis intuitive notion of \"an isomorphism that does not depend on an arbitrary choice\" is formalized in the notion of a [[natural transformation]]; briefly, that one may ''consistently'' identify, or more generally map from, a finite-dimensional vector space to its double dual, <math>\\scriptstyle V \\, \\overset{\\sim}{\\to} \\, V^{**}</math>, for ''any'' vector space in a consistent way.\nFormalizing this intuition is a motivation for the development of category theory.\n\nHowever, there is a case where the distinction between natural isomorphism and equality is usually not made. That is for the objects that may be characterized by a [[universal property]]. In fact, there is a unique isomorphism, necessarily natural, between two objects sharing the same universal property. A typical example is the set of [[real number]]s, which may be defined through infinite decimal expansion, infinite binary expansion, [[Cauchy sequence]]s, [[Dedekind cut]]s and many other ways. Formally these constructions define different objects, which all are solutions of the same universal property. As these objects have exactly the same properties, one may forget the method of construction and considering them as equal. This is what everybody does when talking of \"''the'' set of the real numbers\". The same occurs with [[quotient space]]s: they are commonly constructed as sets of [[equivalence class]]es. However, talking of set of sets may be counterintuitive, and quotient spaces are commonly considered as a pair of a set of undetermined objects, often called \"points\", and a surjective map onto this set.\n\nIf one wishes to draw a distinction between an arbitrary isomorphism (one that depends on a choice) and a natural isomorphism (one that can be done consistently), one may write {{math|\u2248}} for an [[unnatural isomorphism]] and {{math|<big>\u2245</big>}} for a natural isomorphism, as in {{math|1=''V'' \u2248  ''V''*}} and {{math|1=''V'' <big>\u2245</big> ''V''**.}}\nThis convention is not universally followed, and authors who wish to distinguish between unnatural isomorphisms and natural isomorphisms will generally explicitly state the distinction.\n\nGenerally, saying that two objects are ''equal'' is reserved for when there is a notion of a larger (ambient) space that these objects live in. Most often, one speaks of equality of two subsets of a given set (as in the integer set example above), but not of two objects abstractly presented. For example, the 2-dimensional unit sphere in 3-dimensional space\n:<math>S^2 := \\{ (x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\\}</math> and the [[Riemann sphere]] <math>\\widehat{\\mathbb{C}}</math>\n\nwhich can be presented as the [[one-point compactification]] of the complex plane {{math|1='''C''' \u222a {\u221e}}} ''or'' as the complex [[projective line]] (a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]])\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathbb{C}}^1 := (\\mathbb{C}^2\\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}) / (\\mathbb{C}^*)</math>\n\nare three different descriptions for a mathematical object, all of which are isomorphic, but not ''equal'' because they are not all subsets of a single space: the first is a subset of '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, the second is {{math|1='''C''' \u2245 '''R'''}}<sup>2</sup><ref group=\"note\">Being precise, the identification of the complex numbers with the real plane,\n:<math>\\mathbf{C} \\cong \\mathbf{R}\\cdot 1 \\oplus \\mathbf{R} \\cdot i = \\mathbf{R}^2</math>\n\ndepends on a choice of <math>i;</math> one can just as easily choose <math>(-i),</math>, which yields a different identification\u2014formally, [[complex conjugation]] is an automorphism\u2014but in practice one often assumes that one has made such an identification.</ref> plus an additional point, and the third is a [[subquotient]] of '''C'''<sup>2</sup>\n\nIn the context of category theory, objects are usually at most isomorphic\u2014indeed, a motivation for the development of category theory was showing that different constructions in [[homology theory]] yielded equivalent (isomorphic) groups. Given maps between two objects ''X'' and ''Y'', however, one asks if they are equal or not (they are both elements of the set Hom(''X'',&nbsp;''Y''), hence equality is the proper relationship), particularly in [[commutative diagram]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n*[[Bisimulation]]\n*[[Heap (mathematics)]]\n*[[Isometry]]\n*[[Isomorphism class]]\n*[[Isomorphism theorem]]\n*[[Universal property]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{refimprove|date=September 2010}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Citation | first = Barry | last = Mazur | authorlink = Barry Mazur | title = When is one thing equal to some other thing? | date = 12 June 2007 | url = http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf | ref = harv}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|isomorphism}}\n*{{springer|title=Isomorphism|id=p/i052840}}\n*{{planetmath reference|id=1936|title=Isomorphism}}\n*{{MathWorld | urlname=Isomorphism | title = Isomorphism}}\n\n[[Category:Morphisms]]\n[[Category:Equivalence (mathematics)]]", "sha1": "7nm07bi5f0d6e1ja7uo3adgycz864kl"}}, {"title": "Infinite descending chain", "ns": "0", "id": "14829", "revision": {"id": "801216341", "parentid": "786002607", "timestamp": "2017-09-18T11:27:36Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kuli", "id": "24096021"}, "comment": "I think the ring should be the target.

Intergovernmental organizations are  called [[international organization]]s, although that term may also include [[international non-governmental organization]] such as international [[nonprofit organization]]s or [[multinational corporation]]s.\n \nIntergovernmental organizations are an important aspect of [[public international law]]. IGOs are established by a treaty that acts as a [[charter]] creating the group. Treaties are formed when lawful representatives (governments) of several states go through a [[ratification]] process, providing the IGO with an international [[legal personality]].\n\nIntergovernmental organizations in a legal sense should be distinguished from simple groupings or coalitions of states, such as the [[G8]] or the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]]. Such groups or associations have not been founded by a constituent document and exist only as [[task force|task group]]s.\n\nIntergovernmental organizations must also be distinguished from treaties. Many treaties (such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], or the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] before the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]]) do not establish an organization and instead rely purely on the parties for their administration becoming legally recognized as an ''[[ad hoc]]'' commission. Other treaties{{which|date=March 2016}} have established an administrative apparatus which was not deemed to have been granted international legal personality.{{fact|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Types and purpose==\nIntergovernmental organizations differ in function, membership, and membership criteria. They have various goals and scopes, often outlined in the treaty or [[charter]]. Some IGOs developed to fulfill a need for a neutral forum for debate or negotiation to resolve disputes. Others developed to carry out mutual interests with unified aims to preserve peace through [[conflict resolution]] and better [[international relations]], promote international cooperation on matters such as [[List of supranational environmental agencies|environmental protection]], to promote [[human rights]], to promote [[Social change|social development]] (education, [[health care]]), to render [[humanitarian aid]], and to [[economic development]]. Some are more general in scope (the United Nations) while others may have subject-specific missions (such as Interpol or the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and other [[standards organization]]s). Common types include:\n\n* Worldwide or global organizations - generally open to nations worldwide as long as certain criteria are met. This category includes the [[United Nations]] (UN) and its specialized agencies, the [[Universal Postal Union]], [[Interpol]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), the [[World Customs Organization]] (WCO), and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). It also includes globally operating intergovernmental organisations that are not an agency of the UN, including for example the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]], a globally operating intergovernmental organisation based in [[The Hague]] that pursues the progressive unification of [[Conflict of laws|private international law]].\n* Cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical organizations - open to members based on some cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical link. Examples include the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Arab League]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]], [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], [[Turkic Council]], [[International Organization of Turkic Culture]],  [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS).\n* Economic organizations - based on economic organization. Some are dedicated to [[free trade]] and the reduction of trade barrier, e.g. [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[International Chamber of Commerce]]. Others are focused on [[International Development Research Centre|international development]]. International [[cartel]]s, such as [[OPEC]], also exist. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) was founded as an economics-focused organization. An example of a recently formed economic IGO is the [[Bank of the South]].\n* Educational organizations - centered around tertiary level study. [[Academy of European Law]] offers training in European law to lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors, in-house counsel and academics. [[EUCLID (university)]] chartered as a university and umbrella organization dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries and [[United Nations University]] efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are the concern of the United Nations, its Peoples and Member States.\n* Health and Population Organizations- based on the common perceived health and population goals and to address those challenges collectively. An example is the intergovernmental partnership for population and development [http://www.partners-popdev.org/ Partners in Population and Development].\n* [[Regional organization]]s - open to members from a particular continent region or other specific region of the world. This category includes the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CLACS), [[Council of Europe]] (CoE), [[European Union]] (EU), [[Eurasian Economic Union]] (EAEU), [[Energy Community]], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[African Union]] (AU), [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS), [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), Islamic Development Bank, [[Union of South American Nations]], [[Asia Cooperation Dialogue]] (ACD), [[Pacific Islands Forum]], and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).\n\n==Examples ==\n=== United Nations ===\n\n{{Main|United Nations}}\n\nMission\n\n# To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace;\n# To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;\n# To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and\n# To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter I: Purposes and Principles |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YNQicd2P?url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |archivedate=2015-05-08 |df= }}</ref>\n\nMembership\n\n193 Member States.

Among the first were the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]], initiated in the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the International Telegraph Union (the future [[International Telecommunication Union]]), which was founded by the signing of the International Telegraph Convention by 20 countries in May 1865. Of notable significance was the emergence of the [[League of Nations]] following World War One, designed as an institution to foster collective security in order to sustain peace.\n\n==Expansion and growth==\nHeld and McGrew (2002) counted thousands of IGOs worldwide,<ref>Held and McGrew, 2002: Introduction, pp. 1-21</ref> and this number continues to rise. This increase may be attributed to globalization, which increases and encourages the cooperation among and within states. Globalization has also provided easier means for IGO growth, as a result of increased international relations. This is seen economically, politically, militarily, as well as on the domestic level. Economically, IGOs gain material and non-material resources for economic prosperity. IGOs also provide more political stability within the state and among differing states.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Which type of international organizations can settle civil wars?|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=12|issue=4|pages=613\u2013641|doi=10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0}}</ref> Military alliances are also formed by establishing common standards in order to ensure security of the members to ward off outside threats.

For example, Mexican companies are given better access to [[United States|U.S.]] markets due to their membership.\n# Political influence: Smaller countries, such as [[Portugal]] and [[Belgium]], who do not carry much political clout on the international stage, are given a substantial increase in influence through membership in IGOs, such as the [[European Union]]. Also for countries with more influence such as [[France]] and [[Germany]] they are beneficial as the nation increases influence in the smaller countries' internal affairs and expanding other nations dependence on themselves, so to preserve allegiance \n# Security: Membership in an IGO such as [[NATO]] gives security benefits to member countries. This provides an arena where political differences can be resolved.\n# Improve democracy and the likelihood of democratic survival: It has been noted that member countries experience a greater degree of democracy and those democracies survive longer.\n \nReasons for rejecting membership:\n# Loss of [[sovereignty]]: Membership often comes with a loss of state sovereignty as treaties are signed which require cooperation on the part of all member states.\n# Insufficient benefits: Often membership does not bring about substantial enough benefits to warrant membership in the organization.\n\n==Privileges and immunities==\nIntergovernmental organizations are provided with privileges and immunities that are intended to ensure their independent and effective functioning. They are specified in the treaties that give rise to the organization (such as the [[Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations]] and the [[Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court]]), which are normally supplemented by further multinational agreements and national regulations (for example the [[International Organizations Immunities Act]] in the United States). The organizations are thereby immune from the jurisdiction of national courts.\n\nRather than by national jurisdiction, legal [[accountability]] is intended to be ensured by legal mechanisms that are internal to the intergovernmental organization itself<ref>{{cite journal | last = Parish | first = Matthew | title = An essay on the accountability of international organizations | journal = International Organizations Law Review | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 277\u2013342 | doi= 10.1163/157237410X543332 | ssrn = 1651784 | date = 2010 | ref = harv }}</ref> and access to administrative tribunals.

Prohibits the membership of private citizens. This makes IGOs undemocratic. In addition, not all IGOs allow universal membership.\n# IGOs often overlap resulting in a complex network.\n# States have to give up part of their sovereignty, which weakens the state's ability to assert its authority.\n# Inequality among state members creates biases and can lead powerful states to misuse these organizations.\n\nThey can be deemed unfair as countries with a higher percentage voting power have the right to veto any decision that is not in their favor, leaving the smaller countries powerless.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[List of intergovernmental

This draft was based upon the following earlier specifications: unpublished ''IMAP2bis.TXT'' document, RFC1176, and RFC1064 (IMAP2).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-imap-imap2bis-02 |title=INTERACTIVE MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 2bis (Internet Draft) |publisher=IETF |year=1993 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> The ''IMAP2bis.TXT'' draft documented the state of extensions to IMAP2 as of December 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ftp.zcu.cz/pub/network/imap/old/IMAP2bis.TXT |title=IMAP2BIS -- EXTENSIONS TO THE IMAP2 PROTOCOL (DRAFT) |year=1992 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> Early versions of [[Pine (e-mail client)|Pine]] were widely distributed with IMAP2bis support<ref name=\"rfc2061\">{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2061 |title=RFC 2061 - IMAP4 COMPATIBILITY WITH IMAP2BIS |publisher=IETF |year=1996 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> (Pine 4.00 and later supports IMAP4rev1).\n\n===IMAP4===\nAn IMAP Working Group formed in the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] in the early 1990s took over responsibility for the IMAP2bis design. The IMAP WG decided to rename IMAP2bis to IMAP4 to avoid confusion.\n\n==Advantages over POP==\n\n===Connected and disconnected modes of operation===\nWhen using POP, clients typically connect to the e-mail server briefly, only as long as it takes to download new messages. When using IMAP4, clients often stay connected as long as the user interface is active and download message content on demand. For users with many or large messages, this IMAP4 usage pattern can result in faster response times.\n\n===Multiple clients simultaneously connected to the same mailbox===\nThe POP protocol requires the currently connected client to be the only client connected to the mailbox. In contrast, the IMAP protocol specifically allows simultaneous access by multiple clients and provides mechanisms for clients to detect changes made to the mailbox by other, concurrently connected, clients. See for example RFC3501 section 5.2 which specifically cites \"simultaneous access to the same mailbox by multiple agents\" as an example.\n\n===Access to MIME message parts and partial fetch===\nUsually all Internet e-mail is transmitted in [[MIME]] format, allowing messages to have a [[tree structure]] where the leaf nodes are any of a variety of single part content types and the non-leaf nodes are any of a variety of multipart types. The IMAP4 protocol allows clients to retrieve any of the individual MIME parts separately and also to retrieve portions of either individual parts or the entire message. These mechanisms allow clients to retrieve the text portion of a message without retrieving attached files or to [[streaming media|stream]] content as it is being fetched.\n\n===Message state information===\nThrough the use of flags defined in the IMAP4 protocol, clients can keep track of message state: for example, whether or not the message has been read, replied to, or deleted. These flags are stored on the server, so different clients accessing the same mailbox at different times can detect state changes made by other clients. POP provides no mechanism for clients to store such state information on the server so if a single user accesses a mailbox with two different POP clients (at different times), state information\u2014such as whether a message has been accessed\u2014cannot be synchronized between the clients. The IMAP4 protocol supports both predefined system flags and client-defined keywords. System flags indicate state information such as whether a message has been read. Keywords, which are not supported by all IMAP servers, allow messages to be given one or more [[Tag (metadata)|tags]] whose meaning is up to the client. IMAP keywords should not be confused with proprietary labels of [[web-based e-mail]] services which are sometimes translated into IMAP folders by the corresponding proprietary servers.\n\n===Multiple mailboxes on the server===\nIMAP4 clients can create, rename, and/or delete mailboxes (usually presented to the user as folders) on the server, and copy messages between mailboxes. Multiple mailbox support also allows servers to provide access to shared and public folders. The ''IMAP4 Access Control List (ACL) Extension'' (RFC 4314) may be used to regulate access rights.\n\n===Server-side searches===\nIMAP4 provides a mechanism for a client to ask the server to search for messages meeting a variety of criteria. This mechanism avoids requiring clients to download every message in the mailbox in order to perform these searches.\n\n===Built-in extension mechanism===\nReflecting the experience of earlier Internet protocols, IMAP4 defines an explicit mechanism by which it may be extended. Many IMAP4 [[software extension|extension]]s to the base protocol have been proposed and are in common use. IMAP2bis did not have an extension mechanism, and POP now has one defined by RFC 2449.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nWhile IMAP remedies many of the shortcomings of POP, this inherently introduces additional complexity. Much of this complexity (e.g., multiple clients accessing the same mailbox at the same time) is compensated for by [[server-side]] workarounds such as [[Maildir]] or database backends.\n\nThe IMAP specification has been criticised for being insufficiently strict and allowing behaviours that effectively negate its usefulness. For instance, the specification states that each message stored on the server has a \"unique id\" to allow the clients to identify messages they have already seen between sessions. However, the specification also allows these UIDs to be invalidated with no restrictions, practically defeating their purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sup.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/lib/sup/imap.rb |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212234041/http://sup.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/lib/sup/imap.rb |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-12-12 |title=IMAP implementation in Sup, an e-mail client written in Ruby |publisher=rubyforge.com |accessdate=2011-02-22 |df= }} </ref>\n\nUnless the mail storage and searching algorithms on the server are carefully implemented, a client can potentially consume large amounts of server resources when searching massive mailboxes.\n\nIMAP4 clients need to maintain a TCP/IP connection to the IMAP server in order to be notified of the arrival of new mail. Notification of mail arrival is done through [[in-band signaling]], which contributes to the complexity of client-side IMAP protocol handling somewhat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isode.com/whitepapers/imap-idle.html|title=IMAP IDLE: The best approach for 'push' e-mail|publisher=Isode.com|accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref> A private proposal, [[Push-IMAP|push IMAP]], would extend IMAP to implement [[push e-mail]] by sending the entire message instead of just a notification. However, push IMAP has not been generally accepted and current IETF work has addressed the problem in other ways (see the [[Lemonade Profile]] for more information).\n\nUnlike some proprietary protocols which combine sending and retrieval operations, sending a message and saving a copy in a server-side folder with a base-level IMAP client requires transmitting the message content twice, once to SMTP for delivery and a second time to IMAP to store in a sent mail folder. This is remedied by a set of extensions defined by the IETF LEMONADE Working Group for mobile devices: URLAUTH (RFC 4467) and CATENATE (RFC 4469) in IMAP and BURL (RFC 4468) in SMTP-SUBMISSION. POP servers don't support server-side folders so clients have no choice but to store sent items on the client. Many IMAP clients can be configured to store sent mail in a client-side folder, or to BCC oneself and then filter the incoming mail instead of saving a copy in a folder directly. In addition to the LEMONADE \"trio\", [[Courier Mail Server]] offers a non-standard method of sending using IMAP by copying an outgoing message to a dedicated outbox folder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courier-mta.org/imap/INSTALL.html#imapsend|title=Courier-IMAP: Sending mail via an IMAP connection|publisher=Double Precision, Inc|accessdate=2013-09-24}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\n[[STARTTLS]] can be used to provide secure communications between the [[Mail user agent|MUA]] communicating with the [[Mail submission agent|MSA]] or [[Mail Transfer Agent|MTA]] implementing the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP Protocol]].\n\n== Dialog example ==\n\nThis is an example IMAP connection as taken from [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501#section-8 RFC 3501 section 8]:\n\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">C: <open connection></span>\n S:   * OK IMAP4rev1 Service Ready\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">C:   a001 login mrc secret</span>\n S:   a001 OK LOGIN completed\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">C:   a002 select inbox</span>\n S:   * 18 EXISTS\n S:   * FLAGS (\\Answered \\Flagged \\Deleted \\Seen \\Draft)\n S:   * 2 RECENT\n S:   * OK [UNSEEN 17] Message 17 is the first unseen message\n S:   * OK [UIDVALIDITY 3857529045] UIDs valid\n S:   a002 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">C:   a003 fetch 12 full</span>\n S:   * 12 FETCH (FLAGS (\\Seen) INTERNALDATE \"17-Jul-1996 02:44:25 -0700\"\n       RFC822.SIZE 4286 ENVELOPE (\"Wed, 17 Jul 1996 02:23:25 -0700 (PDT)\"\n       \"IMAP4rev1 WG mtg summary and minutes\"\n       ((\"Terry Gray\" NIL \"gray\" \"cac.washington.edu\"))\n       ((\"Terry Gray\" NIL \"gray\" \"cac.washington.edu\"))\n       ((\"Terry Gray\" NIL \"gray\" \"cac.washington.edu\"))\n       ((NIL NIL \"imap\" \"cac.washington.edu\"))\n       ((NIL NIL \"minutes\" \"CNRI.Reston.VA.US\")\n       (\"John Klensin\" NIL \"KLENSIN\" \"MIT.EDU\")) NIL NIL\n       \"<B27397-0100000@cac.washington.edu>\")\n       BODY (\"TEXT\" \"PLAIN\" (\"CHARSET\" \"US-ASCII\") NIL NIL \"7BIT\" 3028\n       92))\n S:   a003 OK FETCH completed\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">C:   a004 fetch 12 body[header]</span>\n S:   * 12 FETCH (BODY[HEADER] {342}\n S:   Date: Wed, 17 Jul 1996 02:23:25 -0700 (PDT)\n S:   From: Terry Gray <gray@cac.washington.edu>\n S:   Subject: IMAP4rev1 WG mtg summary and minutes\n S:   To: imap@cac.washington.edu\n S:   cc: minutes@CNRI.Reston.VA.US, John Klensin <KLENSIN@MIT.EDU>\n S:   Message-Id: <B27397-0100000@cac.washington.edu>\n S:   MIME-Version: 1.0\n S:   Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN;

The physics must account for the [[Coriolis effect]]&mdash;in this case thought of as a force&mdash;to predict the horizontal motion. Another example of such a fictitious force associated with rotating reference frames is the [[centrifugal effect]], or centrifugal force.\n\n==Introduction==\nThe motion of a body can only be described relative to something else&mdash;other bodies, observers, or a set of space-time coordinates. These are called [[frame of reference|frames of reference]]. If the coordinates are chosen badly, the laws of motion may be more complex than necessary. For example, suppose a free body that has no external forces acting on it is at rest at some instant. In many coordinate systems, it would begin to move at the next instant, even though there are no forces on it. However, a frame of reference can always be chosen in which it remains stationary. Similarly, if space is not described uniformly or time independently, a coordinate system could describe the simple flight of a free body in space as a complicated zig-zag in its coordinate system. Indeed, an intuitive summary of inertial frames can be given: in an inertial reference frame, the laws of mechanics take their simplest form.<ref name=LandauMechanics/>\n\nIn an inertial frame, [[Newton's first law]], the ''law of inertia'', is satisfied: Any free motion has a constant magnitude and direction.<ref name=LandauMechanics/> [[Newton's second law]] for a [[Point particle|particle]] takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a} \\ ,</math>\n\nwith '''F''' the net force (a [[Euclidean vector|vector]]), ''m'' the mass of a particle and '''a''' the [[acceleration]] of the particle (also a vector) which would be measured by an observer at rest in the frame. The force '''F''' is the [[vector sum]] of all \"real\" forces on the particle, such as electromagnetic, gravitational, nuclear and so forth. In contrast, Newton's second law in a [[rotating frame of reference]], rotating at angular rate ''\u03a9'' about an axis, takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}' = m \\mathbf{a} \\ ,</math>\n\nwhich looks the same as in an inertial frame, but now the force '''F'''\u2032 is the resultant of not only '''F''', but also additional terms (the paragraph following this equation presents the main points without detailed mathematics):\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}' = \\mathbf{F} - 2m \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{v}_{B} - m \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times (\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x}_B ) - m \\frac{d \\mathbf{\\Omega}}{dt} \\times \\mathbf{x}_B \\ , </math>\n\nwhere the angular rotation of the frame is expressed by the vector '''\u03a9''' pointing in the direction of the axis of rotation, and with magnitude equal to the angular rate of rotation ''\u03a9'', symbol \u00d7 denotes the [[vector cross product]], vector '''x'''<sub>''B''</sub> locates the body and vector '''v'''<sub>''B''</sub> is the [[velocity]] of the body according to a rotating observer (different from the velocity seen by the inertial observer).\n\nThe extra terms in the force '''F'''\u2032 are the \"fictitious\" forces for this frame, whose causes are external to the system in the frame. The first extra term is the [[Coriolis force]], the second the [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]], and the third the [[Euler force]]. These terms all have these properties: they vanish when ''\u03a9'' = 0; that is, they are zero for an inertial frame (which, of course, does not rotate); they take on a different magnitude and direction in every rotating frame, depending upon its particular value of '''\u03a9'''; they are ubiquitous in the rotating frame (affect every particle, regardless of circumstance); and they have no apparent source in identifiable physical sources, in particular, [[matter]]. Also, fictitious forces do not drop off with distance (unlike, for example, [[nuclear force]]s or [[electrical force]]s). For example, the centrifugal force that appears to emanate from the axis of rotation in a rotating frame increases with distance from the axis.\n\nAll observers agree on the real forces, '''F'''; only non-inertial observers need fictitious forces. The laws of physics in the inertial frame are simpler because unnecessary forces are not present.\n\nIn Newton's time the [[fixed stars]] were invoked as a reference frame, supposedly at rest relative to [[absolute space]]. In reference frames that were either at rest with respect to the fixed stars or in uniform translation relative to these stars, [[Newton's laws of motion]] were supposed to hold. In contrast, in frames accelerating with respect to the fixed stars, an important case being frames rotating relative to the fixed stars, the laws of motion did not hold in their simplest form, but had to be supplemented by the addition of [[fictitious forces]], for example, the [[Coriolis force]] and the [[centrifugal force]]. Two interesting experiments were devised by Newton to demonstrate how these forces could be discovered, thereby revealing to an observer that they were not in an inertial frame: the example of the tension in the cord linking [[rotating spheres|two spheres rotating]] about their center of gravity, and the example of the curvature of the surface of water in a [[bucket argument|rotating bucket]]. In both cases, application of [[Newton's second law]] would not work for the rotating observer without invoking centrifugal and Coriolis forces to account for their observations (tension in the case of the spheres; parabolic water surface in the case of the rotating bucket).\n\nAs we now know, the fixed stars are not fixed. Those that reside in the [[Milky Way]] turn with the galaxy, exhibiting [[proper motion]]s. Those that are outside our galaxy (such as nebulae once mistaken to be stars) participate in their own motion as well, partly due to [[expansion of the universe]], and partly due to [[peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]].<ref name=Balbi>{{Cite book|title=The Music of the Big Bang |author=Amedeo Balbi |isbn=3-540-78726-7 |publisher=Springer |date=2008 |page= 59 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vEJM7s909CYC&pg=PA58&dq=CMB+%22rotation+of+the+universe%22 }}</ref> The [[Andromeda galaxy]] is on [[Andromeda\u2013Milky Way collision|collision course with the Milky Way]] at a speed of 117&nbsp;km/s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Constraints on the proper motion of the Andromeda galaxy based on the survival of its satellite M33 |pages=894\u2013898 |author1=Abraham Loeb |author2=Mark J.

Based upon the laws of physics, a model is set up in which one parameter is the rate of rotation of the Universe. If the laws of physics agree more accurately with observations in a model with rotation than without it, we are inclined to select the best-fit value for rotation, subject to all other pertinent experimental observations. If no value of the rotation parameter is successful and theory is not within observational error, a modification of physical law is considered, for example, [[dark matter]] is invoked to explain the [[galactic rotation curve]].

Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is that we might miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach is to look at the way the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.\n\nNewton enunciated a principle of relativity himself in one of his corollaries to the laws of motion:<ref name=Feynman2>{{Cite book|title=Six not-so-easy pieces: Einstein's relativity, symmetry, and space-time |author=Richard Phillips Feynman |page=50 |isbn=0-201-32842-9 |date=1998 |publisher=Basic Books |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ipY8onVQWhcC&pg=PA49&dq=%22The+Principle+of+Relativity%22}}</ref><ref name=Principia>See the ''Principia'' on line at [https://archive.org/stream/newtonspmathema00newtrich#page/n7/mode/2up Andrew Motte Translation]</ref> {{quote|The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a straight line.|Isaac Newton: ''Principia'', Corollary V, p. 88 in Andrew Motte translation}}\n\nThis principle differs from the [[#principle|special principle]] in two ways: first, it is restricted to mechanics, and second, it makes no mention of simplicity.

This allows us to detect experimentally the non-inertial nature of a system.|V. I. Arnol'd: ''Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics'' Second Edition, p. 129}}\nBodies in [[non-inertial reference frame]]s are subject to so-called ''fictitious'' forces (pseudo-forces); that is, [[force]]s that result from the acceleration of the [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] itself and not from any physical force acting on the body. Examples of fictitious forces are the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] and the [[Coriolis force]] in [[rotating reference frame]]s.\n\nHow then, are \"fictitious\" forces to be separated from \"real\" forces? It is hard to apply the Newtonian definition of an inertial frame without this separation. For example, consider a stationary object in an inertial frame. Being at rest, no net force is applied. But in a frame rotating about a fixed axis, the object appears to move in a circle, and is subject to centripetal force (which is made up of the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force). How can we decide that the rotating frame is a non-inertial frame? There are two approaches to this resolution: one approach is to look for the origin of the fictitious forces (the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force). We will find there are no sources for these forces, no associated [[force carrier]]s, no originating bodies.<ref name=note2>For example, there is no body providing a gravitational or electrical attraction.</ref> A second approach is to look at a variety of frames of reference. For any inertial frame, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force disappear, so application of the principle of special relativity would identify these frames where the forces disappear as sharing the same and the simplest physical laws, and hence rule that the rotating frame is not an inertial frame.\n\nNewton examined this problem himself using rotating spheres, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. He pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating, the tension in the tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference.<ref name=tension>That is, the universality of the laws of physics requires the same tension to be seen by everybody. For example, it cannot happen that the string breaks under extreme tension in one frame of reference and remains intact in another frame of reference, just because we choose to look at the string from a different frame.</ref> If the spheres only appear to rotate (that is, we are watching stationary spheres from a rotating frame), the zero tension in the string is accounted for by observing that the centripetal force is supplied by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in combination, so no tension is needed. If the spheres really are rotating, the tension observed is exactly the centripetal force required by the circular motion. Thus, measurement of the tension in the string identifies the inertial frame: it is the one where the tension in the string provides exactly the centripetal force demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame, and not a different value. That is, the inertial frame is the one where the fictitious forces vanish.\n\nSo much for fictitious forces due to rotation. However, for linear acceleration, Newton expressed the idea of undetectability of straight-line accelerations held in common:<ref name=Principia/>\n{{quote|If bodies, any how moved among themselves, are urged in the direction of parallel lines by equal accelerative forces, they will continue to move among themselves, after the same manner as if they had been urged by no such forces. |Isaac Newton: ''Principia'' Corollary VI, p. 89, in Andrew Motte translation }}\n\nThis principle generalizes the notion of an inertial frame. For example, an observer confined in a free-falling lift will assert that he himself is a valid inertial frame, even if he is accelerating under gravity, so long as he has no knowledge about anything outside the lift. So, strictly speaking, inertial frame is a relative concept. With this in mind, we can define inertial frames collectively as a set of frames which are stationary or moving at constant velocity with respect to each other, so that a single inertial frame is defined as an element of this set.\n\nFor these ideas to apply, everything observed in the frame has to be subject to a base-line, common acceleration shared by the frame itself. That situation would apply, for example, to the elevator example, where all objects are subject to the same gravitational acceleration, and the elevator itself accelerates at the same rate.\n\n===Applications===\n[[Inertial navigation system]]s used a cluster of [[gyroscope]]s and accelerometers to determine accelerations relative to inertial space. After a gyroscope is spun up in a particular orientation in inertial space, the law of conservation of angular momentum requires that it retain that orientation as long as no external forces are applied to it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chatfield|first=Averil B.|title=Fundamentals of High Accuracy Inertial Navigation, Volume 174|date=1997|publisher=AIAA|isbn=9781600864278}}</ref>{{rp|59}}  Three orthogonal gyroscopes establish an inertial reference frame, and the accelerators measure acceleration relative to that frame.

It does so, not by sensing the Earth's magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The outer casing of the gyrocompass device is held in such a way that it remains aligned with the local plumb line. When the gyroscope wheel inside the gyrocompass device is spun up, the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis with the Earth's axis. Alignment with the Earth's axis is the only direction for which the gyroscope's spinning axis can be stationary with respect to the Earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being spun up, a gyrocompass can reach the direction of alignment with the Earth's axis in as little as a quarter of an hour.<ref name=l>{{cite journal|title=The gyroscope pilots ships & planes |journal=Life|date=Mar 15, 1943 |pages=80&ndash;83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82}}</ref>\n\n==Newtonian mechanics==\n{{Unreferenced section|small=y|date=May 2018}} \n{{Main|Newton's laws of motion}}\nClassical theories that use the [[Galilean transformation]] postulate the equivalence of all inertial reference frames.

In general relativity, the principle of inertia is replaced with the principle of [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic motion]], whereby objects move in a way dictated by the curvature of spacetime. As a consequence of this curvature, it is not a given in general relativity that inertial objects moving at a particular rate with respect to each other will continue to do so. This phenomenon of [[geodesic deviation]] means that inertial frames of reference do not exist globally as they do in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.\n\nHowever, the general theory reduces to the special theory over sufficiently small regions of spacetime, where curvature effects become less important and the earlier inertial frame arguments can come back into play.<ref>{{cite book |title=Information Theory and Quantum Physics: Physical Foundations for Understanding the Conscious Process |first1=Herbert S. |last1=Green |publisher=Springer |date=2000 |isbn=354066517X |page=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CUJiQjSVCu8C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=CUJiQjSVCu8C&pg=PA154 Extract of page 154]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Theory of Special Relativity |first1=Nikhilendu |last1=Bandyopadhyay |publisher=Academic Publishers |date=2000 |isbn=8186358528 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMOyfi_i0j8C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=qMOyfi_i0j8C&pg=PA116 Extract of page 116]</ref> Consequently, modern special relativity is now sometimes described as only a \"local theory\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Cosmological Inflation and Large-Scale Structure |first1=Andrew R. |last1=Liddle |first2=David H. |last2=Lyth |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2000 |isbn=0-521-57598-2 |page=329 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmWauPZSovMC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=XmWauPZSovMC&pg=PA329 Extract of page 329]</ref> \"Local\" can encompass, for example, the entire Milky Way galaxy: The astronomer [[Karl Schwarzschild]] observed the motion of pairs of stars orbiting each other.

Many Organization names are spoofs of real organizations, presumably altered to avoid lawsuits. \n\nOther ways to achieve victory include: destroying your rival Illuminati by capturing or destroying the last Organization in their Power Structure; and/or fulfilling a Special Goal before your opponent(s) can.\n\n==Card types==\n\nCards come in three main types: Illuminati cards, Plot cards, and Group cards. Illuminati and Plot cards both feature an illustration of a puppeteer's hand in a blue color scheme on the rear side, whereas Group cards feature a puppet on a string in a red color scheme. \n\nEach Illuminati card represents a different Illuminated organization at the center of each player's Power Structure. They have Power, a Special Goal, and an appropriate Special Ability. Their power flows outwards into the Groups they control via Control Arrows. \n\nPlot cards provide the bulk of the game's narrative structure, allowing players to go beyond - or even break - the rules of the game as described in the World Domination Handbook. Plot cards are identified by their  overall blue color scheme (border, and/or title  color). Included among the general Plots are several special types, including ''Assassinations'' and ''Disasters'' (for delivering insults to the various Personalities and Places in play), ''GOAL'' (special goals that can lead to surprise victories), and ''New World Order'' cards (a set of conditions that affect all players, typically overridden when replacement ''New World Order'' cards are brought into play).\n\nGroup cards represent the power elite in charge of the named organization. There are two main types of Group: Organizations and Resources. \n\nOrganizations are identified by their overall red color scheme (border and/or title). There are three main types of Organization: regular Organizations, People, and Places. They all feature Power, Resistance, Special Abilities, Alignments, Attributes, and Control Arrows (an inward arrow, and 0-3 outward arrows). Just like their Illuminati masters, Organizations can launch and defend against a variety of attacks. Provided that the attacking Organization has a free, outward-pointing Control Arrow, players can increase the size of their Power Structure via successful Attacks to Control, a mathematically determined method employed whenever a player wants to capture an Organization from their own hand, or from a rival player's Power Structure. Unless the attack is Privileged (only the target and attacker can be involved), all players can aid or undermine the attack. Attacks to Destroy follow a similar game mechanic, but result in the Organization's removal from the Power Structure, after which they are immediately discarded. The outcome of all Attacks are determined by a dice roll. Other ways to introduce Organizations to the Power Structure involve Plots, or spending Action Tokens to bring Groups into play, or by using free moves, each at appropriate times during the play cycle. \n\nResources represent the custodians of a variety of objects, ranging from gadgets to artefacts (such as [[The Shroud of Turin]], [[Flying Saucers]], and [[ELIZA]]). They are identified by their overall purple color scheme (border and/or title). Resources are introduced into play by spending Action Tokens, or by using free moves during appropriate moments in the play cycle. They go alongside the Power Structure of the player's Illuminati, and bestow a useful Special Ability or similar.\n\n== General References ==\n''The INWO Book'' (1995) Steve Jackson Games

Interstellar travel will be much more difficult than [[interplanetary spaceflight]]; the distances between the [[planet]]s in the [[Solar System]] are less than 30 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU)\u2014whereas the distances between stars are typically hundreds of thousands of AU, and usually expressed in [[light-year]]s. Because of the vastness of those distances, interstellar travel would require a high percentage of the [[speed of light]]; huge travel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer; or a combination of both.\n\nThe speeds required for interstellar travel in a human lifetime far exceed what current methods of [[spacecraft propulsion]] can provide. Even with a hypothetically perfectly efficient propulsion system, the [[kinetic energy]] corresponding to those speeds is enormous by today's standards of [[energy development]]. Moreover, collisions by the spacecraft with [[cosmic dust]] and gas can produce very dangerous effects both to passengers and the spacecraft itself.\n\nA number of strategies have been proposed to deal with these problems, ranging from giant arks that would carry entire societies and ecosystems, to microscopic [[space probe]]s. Many different [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems have been proposed to give spacecraft the required speeds, including [[nuclear propulsion]], [[beam-powered propulsion]], and methods based on speculative physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/advocacy/interstellar-travel|title=Interstellar Travel|website=www.bis-space.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-16}}</ref>\n\nFor both crewed and uncrewed interstellar travel, considerable technological and economic challenges need to be met.

Upon return, there would be a difference between the time elapsed on the astronaut's ship and the time elapsed on Earth.\n\nFor example, a spaceship could travel to a star 32 light-years away, initially accelerating at a constant 1.03g (i.e. 10.1&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>) for 1.32 years (ship time), then stopping its engines and coasting for the next 17.3 years (ship time) at a constant speed, then decelerating again for 1.32 ship-years, and coming to a stop at the destination. After a short visit, the astronaut could return to Earth the same way. After the full round-trip, the clocks on board the ship show that 40 years have passed, but according to those on Earth, the ship comes back 76 years after launch.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the astronaut, onboard clocks seem to be running normally. The star ahead seems to be approaching at a speed of 0.87 light years per ship-year. The universe would appear contracted along the direction of travel to half the size it had when the ship was at rest; the distance between that star and the Sun would seem to be 16 light years as measured by the astronaut.\n\nAt higher speeds, the time on board will run even slower, so the astronaut could travel to the center of the [[Milky Way]] (30,000 light years from Earth) and back in 40 years ship-time. But the speed according to Earth clocks will always be less than 1 light year per Earth year, so, when back home, the astronaut will find that more than 60 thousand years will have passed on Earth.\n\n==== Constant acceleration ====\n{{See also|Space travel using constant acceleration}}\n\n[[File:Roundtriptimes.png|thumb|upright=1.4|This plot shows a ship capable of 1-[[Gravitational acceleration|g]] (10&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> or about 1.0 ly/y<sup>2</sup>) \"felt\" or proper-acceleration<ref>{{cite web | title= Clock paradox III | url= http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/spacetime/STP1stEdExercP81to100.pdf}} {{cite book | author1= Taylor, Edwin F. | author2= Wheeler, John Archibald | date= 1966 | title= Spacetime Physics | publisher= W.H.

A constant acceleration journey is one where the propulsion system accelerates the ship at a constant rate for the first half of the journey, and then decelerates for the second half, so that it arrives at the destination stationary relative to where it began.  If this were performed with an acceleration similar to that experienced at the Earth's surface, it would have the added advantage of producing artificial \"gravity\" for the crew. Supplying the energy required, however, would be prohibitively expensive with current technology.<ref>Crowell, Benjamin (2011), Light and Matter Section 4.3</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of a planetary observer, the ship will appear to accelerate steadily at first, but then more gradually as it approaches the speed of light (which it cannot exceed).

As part of this, distances between objects in the direction of the ship's motion will gradually contract until the ship begins to decelerate, at which time an onboard observer's experience of the gravitational field will be reversed.\n\nWhen the ship reaches its destination, if it were to exchange a message with its origin planet, it would find that less time had elapsed on board than had elapsed for the planetary observer, due to [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]].\n\nThe result is an impressively fast journey for the crew.\n\n== Propulsion ==\n\n=== Rocket concepts ===\nAll rocket concepts are limited by the [[rocket equation]], which sets the characteristic velocity available as a function of exhaust velocity and mass ratio, the ratio of initial (''M''<sub>0</sub>, including fuel) to final (''M''<sub>1</sub>, fuel depleted) mass.\n\nVery high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], the ratio of thrust to total vehicle mass, is required to reach interstellar targets within sub-century time-frames.<ref>{{cite journal | title= VISTA \u2013 A Vehicle for Interplanetary Space Transport Application Powered by Inertial Confinement Fusion | author= Orth, C.

In an ion engine, electric power is used to create charged particles of the propellant, usually the gas xenon, and accelerate them to extremely high velocities. The exhaust velocity of conventional rockets is limited by the chemical energy stored in the fuel\u2019s molecular bonds, which limits the thrust to about 5&nbsp;km/s. They produce a high thrust (about 10\u2076 N), but they have a low specific impulse, and that limits their top speed.

For maximum velocity, the reaction mass should optimally consist of fission products, the \"ash\" of the primary energy source, so no extra reaction mass need be bookkept in the mass ratio.\n\n===== Nuclear pulse =====\n{{Main|Nuclear pulse propulsion}}\n[[File:Modern Pulsed Fission Propulsion Concept.jpg|thumb|Modern Pulsed Fission Propulsion Concept.]]Based on work in the late 1950s to the early 1960s, it has been technically possible to build spaceships with [[nuclear pulse propulsion]] engines, i.e. driven by a series of nuclear explosions. This propulsion system contains the prospect of very high [[specific impulse]] (space travel's equivalent of fuel economy) and high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]].<ref name=\"GeneralDynamics1964NuclearPulseVehicleCondensed\">{{cite web\n | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760065935_1976065935.pdf\n |format=PDF| title=Nuclear Pulse Vehicle Study Condensed Summary Report (General Dynamics Corp.)\n |date=January 1964\n | author=[[General Dynamics]] Corp.\n | publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce National Technical Information Service\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] team member [[Freeman Dyson]] proposed in 1968 an interstellar spacecraft using nuclear pulse propulsion that used pure [[deuterium fusion]] detonations with a very high fuel-[[burnup]] fraction. He computed an exhaust velocity of 15,000&nbsp;km/s and a 100,000-tonne space vehicle able to achieve a 20,000&nbsp;km/s [[delta-v]] allowing a flight-time to [[Alpha Centauri]] of 130 years.<ref name=\"Interstellar Transport\">{{cite journal\n |author=Freeman J.

A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by fusion-antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion units would be similarly in the 10% range and pure matter-antimatter annihilation rockets would be theoretically capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% to 80% of the speed of light. In each case saving fuel for slowing down halves the maximum speed. The concept of using a [[magnetic sail]] to decelerate the spacecraft as it approaches its destination has been discussed as an alternative to using propellant, this would allow the ship to travel near the maximum theoretical velocity.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Use of Mini-Mag Orion and superconducting coils for near-term interstellar transportation | author1= Lenard, Roger X. | author2= Andrews, Dana G. | journal= Acta Astronautica | date= June 2007 | volume= 61 | issue= 1\u20136 | url= http://www.space-nation.org/images/a/a1/Mini-Mag_Orion_and_superconducting_coils_for_near-term_interstellar_transportation_LenardAndrews.pdf | doi= 10.1016/j.actaastro.2007.01.052 | pages=450\u2013458|bibcode = 2007AcAau..61..450L }}</ref> Alternative designs utilizing similar principles include [[Project Longshot]], [[Project Daedalus]], and [[Mini-Mag Orion]]. The principle of external nuclear pulse propulsion to maximize survivable power has remained common among serious concepts for interstellar flight without external power beaming and for very high-performance interplanetary flight.\n\nIn the 1970s the Nuclear Pulse Propulsion concept further was refined by [[Project Daedalus]] by use of externally triggered [[inertial confinement fusion]], in this case producing fusion explosions via compressing fusion fuel pellets with high-powered electron beams. Since then, [[laser]]s, [[ion beam]]s, [[neutral particle beam]]s and hyper-kinetic projectiles have been suggested to produce nuclear pulses for propulsion purposes.<ref name=\"The Release of Thermonuclear Energy by Inertial Confinement\">{{cite book\n | author=Friedwardt Winterberg\n | date=2010\n | title=The Release of Thermonuclear Energy by Inertial Confinement\n | publisher=World Scientific\n | isbn=978-981-4295-91-8\n}}</ref>\n\nA current impediment to the development of ''any'' nuclear-explosion-powered spacecraft is the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty]], which includes a prohibition on the detonation of any nuclear devices (even non-weapon based) in outer space. This treaty would, therefore, need to be renegotiated, although a project on the scale of an interstellar mission using currently foreseeable technology would probably require international cooperation on at least the scale of the [[International Space Station]].\n\nAnother issue to be considered, would be the [[g-force]]s imparted to a rapidly accelerated spacecraft, cargo, and passengers inside (see [[Inertia negation]]).\n\n==== Nuclear fusion rockets ====\n[[Fusion rocket]] starships, powered by [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, should conceivably be able to reach speeds of the order of 10% of that of light, based on energy considerations alone. In theory, a large number of stages could push a vehicle arbitrarily close to the speed of light.<ref name=\"L.D. Jaffe 1963, pp. 49-58\" /> These would \"burn\" such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, <sup>3</sup>He, <sup>11</sup>B, and <sup>7</sup>Li. Because fusion yields about 0.3\u20130.9% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases <0.1% of the fuel's mass-energy. The maximum exhaust velocities potentially energetically available are correspondingly higher than for fission, typically 4\u201310% of c. However, the most easily achievable fusion reactions release a large fraction of their energy as high-energy neutrons, which are a significant source of energy loss. Thus, although these concepts seem to offer the best (nearest-term) prospects for travel to the nearest stars within a (long) human lifetime, they still involve massive technological and engineering difficulties, which may turn out to be intractable for decades or centuries.\n\n[[File:Daedalus ship.png|thumb|Daedalus interstellar vehicle.]]Early studies include [[Project Daedalus]], performed by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] in 1973\u20131978, and [[Project Longshot]], a student project sponsored by [[NASA]] and the [[US Naval Academy]], completed in 1988. Another fairly detailed vehicle system, \"Discovery II\",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110610051632/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2005/TM-2005-213559.pdf PDF] C. R.

It achieves characteristic velocities of >300&nbsp;km/s with an acceleration of ~1.7\u202210<sup>\u22123</sup> ''g'', with a ship initial mass of ~1700 metric tons, and payload fraction above 10%. Although these are still far short of the requirements for interstellar travel on human timescales, the study seems to represent a reasonable benchmark towards what may be approachable within several decades, which is not impossibly beyond the current state-of-the-art. Based on the concept's 2.2% [[burnup]] fraction it could achieve a pure fusion product exhaust velocity of ~3,000&nbsp;km/s.\n\n==== Antimatter rockets ====\n{{Main|Antimatter rocket}}\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}\nAn [[antimatter rocket]] would have a far higher energy density and specific impulse than any other proposed class of rocket.<ref name=\"crawist\" /> If energy resources and efficient production methods are found to make [[antimatter]] in the quantities required and store<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/about/engineering/storing-antimatter|title=Storing antimatter - CERN|website=home.web.cern.ch}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2011/06/05/alpha-quarter-hour/|title=ALPHA Stores Antimatter Atoms Over a Quarter of an Hour \u2013 and Still Counting - Berkeley Lab|date=5 June 2011|publisher=}}</ref> it safely, it would be theoretically possible to reach speeds of several tens of percent that of light.<ref name=\"crawist\" /> Whether antimatter propulsion could lead to the higher speeds (>90% that of light) at which relativistic [[time dilation]] would become more noticeable, thus making time pass at a slower rate for the travelers as perceived by an outside observer, is doubtful owing to the large quantity of antimatter that would be required.<ref name=\"crawist\" />\n\nSpeculating that production and storage of antimatter should become feasible, two further issues need to be considered. First, in the annihilation of antimatter, much of the energy is lost as high-energy [[gamma radiation]], and especially also as [[neutrino]]s, so that only about 40% of ''mc''<sup>2</sup> would actually be available if the antimatter were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally.<ref name=\"crawist\" /> Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of ''mc''<sup>2</sup> yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best rival candidate.\n\nSecond, heat transfer from the exhaust to the vehicle seems likely to transfer enormous wasted energy into the ship (e.g. for 0.1''g'' ship acceleration, approaching 0.3 trillion watts per ton of ship mass), considering the large fraction of the energy that goes into penetrating gamma rays. Even assuming shielding was provided to protect the payload (and passengers on a crewed vehicle), some of the energy would inevitably heat the vehicle, and may thereby prove a limiting factor if useful accelerations are to be achieved.\n\nMore recently, [[Friedwardt Winterberg]] proposed that a matter-antimatter GeV gamma ray laser photon rocket is possible by a relativistic proton-antiproton pinch discharge, where the recoil from the laser beam is transmitted by the [[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]] to the spacecraft.<ref name=\"AA-20120821\">{{cite journal |last=Winterberg |first=F. |title=Matter\u2013antimatter gigaelectron volt gamma ray laser rocket propulsion |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576512002640 |date=21 August 2012 |journal=[[Acta Astronautica]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=34\u201339 |accessdate=25 April 2015 |bibcode = 2012AcAau..81...34W |doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.07.001 }}</ref>\n\n==== Rockets with an external energy source ====\nRockets deriving their power from external sources, such as a [[laser]], could replace their internal energy source with an energy collector, potentially reducing the mass of the ship greatly and allowing much higher travel speeds. [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] has proposed for an [[interstellar probe]], with energy supplied by an external laser from a base station powering an [[Ion thruster]].<ref name=\"geoffreylandis.com\">{{cite conference | url= http://www.geoffreylandis.com/laser_ion_pres.htp | title= Laser-powered Interstellar Probe | author= Landis, Geoffrey A. | conference= Conference on Practical Robotic Interstellar Flight | location= NY University, New York, NY | date= 29 August 1994 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131002200923/http://www.geoffreylandis.com/laser_ion_pres.htp | archivedate= 2 October 2013 | df=  }}</ref>\n\n=== Non-rocket concepts ===\nA problem with all traditional rocket propulsion methods is that the spacecraft would need to carry its fuel with it, thus making it very massive, in accordance with the [[rocket equation]]. Several concepts attempt to escape from this problem:<ref name=\"crawist\" /><ref>A. Bolonkin (2005). ''Non Rocket Space Launch and Flight''. Elsevier. {{ISBN|978-0-08-044731-5}}</ref>\n\n==== Interstellar ramjets ====\nIn 1960, [[Robert W. Bussard]] proposed the [[Bussard ramjet]], a fusion rocket in which a huge scoop would collect the diffuse hydrogen in interstellar space, \"burn\" it on the fly using a [[proton\u2013proton chain reaction]], and expel it out of the back. Later calculations with more accurate estimates suggest that the thrust generated would be less than the drag caused by any conceivable scoop design.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Yet the idea is attractive because the fuel would be collected ''en route'' (commensurate with the concept of ''energy harvesting''), so the craft could theoretically accelerate to near the speed of light. The limitation is due to the fact that the reaction can only accelerate the propellant to 0.12c. Thus the drag of catching interstellar dust and the thrust of accelerating that same dust to 0.12c would be the same when the speed is 0.12c, preventing further acceleration.\n\n==== Beamed propulsion ====\n[[File:Forward-sailcraft-scheme.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates [[Robert L. Forward]]'s scheme for slowing down an interstellar [[solar sail|light-sail]] at the star system destination.]]\n\nA [[solar sail|light sail]] or [[magnetic sail]] powered by a massive [[laser]] or particle accelerator in the home star system could potentially reach even greater speeds than rocket- or pulse propulsion methods, because it would not need to carry its own [[reaction mass]] and therefore would only need to accelerate the craft's [[Payload (air and spacecraft)|payload]]. [[Robert L. Forward]] proposed a means for decelerating an interstellar light sail in the destination star system without requiring a laser array to be present in that system. In this scheme, a smaller secondary sail is deployed to the rear of the spacecraft, whereas the large primary sail is detached from the craft to keep moving forward on its own. Light is reflected from the large primary sail to the secondary sail, which is used to decelerate the secondary sail and the spacecraft payload.<ref name=\"Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar\">{{cite journal | author=Forward, R.L. | title=Roundtrip Interstellar Travel Using Laser-Pushed Lightsails | journal=J Spacecraft | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=187\u2013195 | date=1984 | doi=10.2514/3.8632 |bibcode = 1984JSpRo..21..187F }}</ref> In 2002, [[Geoffrey A.

Moreover, once the travelers arrive at their destination (by any means), they will not be able to travel down to the surface of the target world and set up a colony unless the atmosphere is non-lethal. The prospect of making such a journey, only to spend the rest of the colony's life inside a sealed habitat and venturing outside in a spacesuit, may eliminate many prospective targets from the list.\n\nMoving at a speed close to the speed of light and encountering even a tiny stationary object like a grain of sand will have fatal consequences.

It is used by [[Router (computing)|router]]s to exchange [[routing]] data within an [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]].\n\nIGRP is a [[proprietary protocol]].  IGRP was created in part to overcome the limitations of [[Routing Information Protocol|RIP]] (maximum hop count of only 15, and a single routing metric) when used within large networks. IGRP supports multiple metrics for each route, including [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], [[Network delay|delay]], [[Load (computing)|load]], and [[Reliability (computer networking)|reliability]]; to compare two routes these metrics are combined together into a single metric, using a formula which can be adjusted through the use of pre-set constants. By default, the IGRP composite metric is a sum of the segment delays and the lowest segment bandwidth. The maximum configurable hop count of IGRP-routed packets is 255 (default 100), and routing updates are [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] every 90 seconds (by default).<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/ip/configuration/guide/1cfigrp.html Cisco Systems] Configuring IGRP</ref> IGRP uses [[List of IP protocol numbers|protocol number]] 9 for communication.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xml\n|title=Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers\n|publisher=[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA)\n|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIGRP is considered a [[Classful network|classful]] routing protocol. Because the protocol has no field for a [[subnet mask]], the router assumes that all subnetwork addresses within the same Class A, Class B, or Class C network have the same subnet mask as the subnet mask configured for the interfaces in question. This contrasts with classless routing protocols that can use [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|variable length subnet masks]]. Classful protocols have become less popular as they are wasteful of [[IPv4 address exhaustion|IP address space]].\n\n==Advancement==\nIn order to address the issues of address space and other factors, Cisco created [[EIGRP]] (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  EIGRP adds support for [[VLSM]] (variable length subnet mask) and adds the [[Diffusing Update Algorithm]] (DUAL) in order to improve routing and provide a loopless environment.  EIGRP has completely replaced IGRP, making IGRP an obsolete routing protocol.  In Cisco IOS versions 12.3 and greater, IGRP is completely unsupported. In the new Cisco [[CCNA]] curriculum (version 4), IGRP is mentioned only briefly, as an \"obsolete protocol\".\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_white_paper09186a00800c8ae1.shtml Cisco - An Introduction to IGRP]\n* [http://www.google.com/patents/US5088032 US Patent 5,088,032 \"Method and apparatus for routing communications among computer networks\"]\n\n[[Category:Cisco protocols]]\n[[Category:Routing protocols]]", "sha1": "dvuagnd177m2v4pd4cqud6r3n4kzodd"}}, {"title": "IRS (disambiguation)", "ns": "0", "id": "14845", "revision": {"id": "855485086", "parentid": "855485016", "timestamp": "2018-08-18T17:15:33Z", "contributor": {"username": "QuickWittedHare", "id": "33360222"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Undid revision 855485016 by [[Special:Contributions/QuickWittedHare|QuickWittedHare]] ([[User talk:QuickWittedHare|talk]]) already linked on \"IRS\"", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Selfref|For Wikipedia's policy on identifying reliable sources, see [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources]].}}\n{{Wiktionary|IRS}}\n'''[[IRS]]''' is the United States Internal Revenue Service.  \n\n'''IRS''' may also refer to:\n{{TOC right}}\n==Arts and entertainment==\n* [[I.R.S.

Today, nearly 42% of the human population (3.2 billion) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language, by far the highest of any language family.\n\nThe Indo-European family includes most of the modern [[languages of Europe]]; notable exceptions include [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], and [[Sami languages|Sami]].

With written evidence appearing since the [[Bronze Age]] in the form of the [[Anatolian languages]] and [[Mycenaean Greek]], the Indo-European family is significant to the field of [[historical linguistics]] as possessing the second-longest [[recorded history]], after the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic family]], although certain [[language isolate]]s, such as [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], [[Hattian language|Hattian]], and [[Kassite language|Kassite]] are recorded earlier.\n\nAll Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language, [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], spoken sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era.

Membership in the various branches, groups and subgroups of Indo-European is also genealogical, but here the defining factors are ''shared innovations'' among various languages, suggesting a common ancestor that split off from other Indo-European groups. For example, what makes the Germanic languages a branch of Indo-European is that much of their structure and phonology can be stated in rules that apply to all of them. Many of their common features are presumed innovations that took place in [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], the source of all the Germanic languages.\n\n===Tree versus wave model===\n{{See also|Language change}}\nThe \"[[tree model]]\" is considered an appropriate representation of the genealogical history of a language family if communities do not remain in contact after their languages have started to diverge. In this case, subgroups defined by shared innovations form a nested pattern. The tree model is not appropriate in cases where languages remain in contact as they diversify; in such cases subgroups may overlap, and the \"[[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]]\" is a more accurate representation.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Fran\u00e7ois\n  | first = Alexandre\n  | contribution = Trees, Waves and Linkages: Models of Language Diversification\n  | editor1-last = Bowern\n  | editor1-first = Claire\n  | editor2-last = Evans\n  | editor2-first = Bethwyn\n  | title = The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics\n  | series=\n  | pages = 161\u2013189\n  | publisher = Routledge\n  | place = London\n  | year = 2014\n  | isbn = 978-0-41552-789-7\n  | contribution-url = http://alex.francois.free.fr/data/AlexFrancois_2014_HHL_Trees-waves-linkages_Diversification.pdf\n  | ref = francois\n }}</ref> Most approaches to Indo-European subgrouping to date have assumed that the tree model is by-and-large valid for Indo-European;<ref>{{cite journal | title= From August Schleicher to Sergei Starostin: on the development of the tree-diagram models of the Indo-European languages | author= Bla\u017eek, V\u00e1clav | journal= Journal of Indo-European Studies | year= 2007 | volume= 35 | issue= 1\u20132 | pages= 82\u2013109}}</ref> however, there is also a long tradition of wave-model approaches.<ref>{{cite book | title= Les dialectes indo-europ\u00e9ens | publisher= Honor\u00e9 Champion | author= Meillet, Antoine | year= 1908 | location= Paris}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title= I dialetti indoeuropei | publisher= Paideia | author= Bonfante, Giuliano | year= 1931 | location= Brescia}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title= Die Gliederung des indogermanischen Sprachgebiets | publisher= Carl Winter Universit\u00e4tsverlag | author= Porzig, Walter | year= 1954 | location= Heidelberg}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to genealogical changes, many of the early changes in Indo-European languages can be attributed to [[language contact]]. It has been asserted, for example, that many of the more striking features shared by Italic languages (Latin, Oscan, Umbrian, etc.) might well be [[Areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]]. More certainly, very similar-looking alterations in the systems of [[long vowel]]s in the West Germanic languages greatly postdate any possible notion of a [[proto-language]] innovation (and cannot readily be regarded as \"areal\", either, because English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area). In a similar vein, there are many similar innovations in Germanic and Balto-Slavic that are far more likely areal features than traceable to a common proto-language, such as the uniform development of a [[high vowel]] (*''u'' in the case of Germanic, *''i/u'' in the case of Baltic and Slavic) before the PIE syllabic resonants *''\u1e5b,* \u1e37, *\u1e43, *\u1e47'', unique to these two groups among IE languages, which is in agreement with the wave model. The [[Balkan sprachbund]] even features areal convergence among members of very different branches.\n\nUsing an extension to the ''[[Donald Ringe|Ringe]]-[[Tandy Warnow|Warnow]] model of language evolution'', early IE was confirmed to have featured limited contact between distinct lineages, whereas only the Germanic subfamily exhibited a less treelike behaviour as it acquired some characteristics from neighbours early in its evolution rather than from its direct ancestors. The internal diversification of especially West Germanic is cited to have been radically non-treelike.<ref>{{Cite journal |url= http://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/Papers/NRWlanguage.pdf |title= Perfect Phylogenetic Networks: A New Methodology for Reconstructing the Evolutionary History of Natural Languages |first= Luay |last= Nakhleh |first2= Don |last2= Ringe |lastauthoramp= yes |first3= Tandy |last3= Warnow|author3-link= Tandy Warnow |year= 2005 |journal= Language |volume= 81 |issue= 2 |pages= 382\u2013420 |doi= 10.1353/lan.2005.0078 |postscript= <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

According to another view, the Anatolian subgroup left the Indo-European parent language comparatively late, approximately at the same time as Indo-Iranian and later than the Greek or Armenian divisions. A third view, especially prevalent in the so-called French school of Indo-European studies, holds that extant similarities in non-[[satem]] languages in general\u2014including Anatolian\u2014might be due to their peripheral location in the Indo-European language-area and to early separation, rather than indicating a special ancestral relationship.<ref>''Britannica'' 15th edition, 22 p. 594, \"Indo-Hittite hypothesis\"</ref> Hans J.

In the satem languages, which include the Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian branches, as well as (in most respects) Albanian and Armenian, the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European phonology#Consonants|Proto-Indo-European palatovelars]] remained distinct and were fricativized, while the labiovelars merged with the \"plain velars\". In the centum languages, the palatovelars merged with the plain velars, while the labiovelars remained distinct. The results of these alternative developments are exemplified by the words for \"hundred\" in Avestan (''satem'') and Latin (''centum'')\u2014the initial palatovelar developed into a fricative [s] in the former, but became an ordinary velar [k] in the latter.\n\nRather than being a genealogical separation, the centum\u2013satem division is commonly seen as resulting from innovative changes that spread across PIE dialect-branches over a particular geographical area; the centum\u2013satem [[isogloss]] intersects a number of other isoglosses that mark distinctions between features in the early IE branches. It may be that the centum branches in fact reflect the original state of affairs in PIE, and only the satem branches shared a set of innovations, which affected all but the peripheral areas of the PIE dialect continuum.<ref>''Britannica'' 15th edition, vol.22, 1981, pp. 588, 594</ref> Kortlandt proposes that the ancestors of Balts and Slavs took part in satemization before being drawn later into the western Indo-European sphere.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf |first= Frederik |last= Kortlandt |title= The spread of the Indo-Europeans |year= 1989 |format= PDF |date= |accessdate= 2010-08-07}}</ref>\n\n===Suggested macrofamilies===\n{{See also|Origin of language}}\n\nSome linguists propose that Indo-European languages form part of one of several hypothetical [[macrofamily|macrofamilies]]. However, these theories remain highly controversial, not being accepted by most linguists in the field. Some of the smaller proposed macrofamilies include:\n\n* [[Pontic languages|Pontic]], postulated by [[John Colarusso]], which joins Indo-European with [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]]\n* [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]], joining Indo-European with [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]\n\nOther, greater proposed families including Indo-European languages, include:\n\n* [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], a theory championed by [[Joseph Greenberg]]\n* [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]], comprising all or some of the Eurasiatic languages, as well as the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]], [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (or even the [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|Elamo-Dravidian]] macrofamily), [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], and [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language families\n\nObjections to such groupings are not based on any theoretical claim about the likely historical existence or non-existence of such macrofamilies; it is entirely reasonable to suppose that they might have existed. The serious difficulty lies in identifying the details of actual relationships between language families, because it is very hard to find concrete evidence that transcends chance resemblance, or is not equally likely explained as being due to [[loanword|borrowing]] (including [[Wanderwort|Wanderw\u00f6rter]], which can travel very long distances). Because the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] in historical linguistics declines steadily over time, at great enough time-depths it becomes open to reasonable doubt that one can even distinguish between signal and noise.\n\n==Evolution==\n\n===Proto-Indo-European===\n{{Main|Proto-Indo-European language}}\n[[File:IE expansion.png|upright=0.9|thumb|Scheme of Indo-European migrations from ca. 4000 to 1000 BC according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]].]]\nThe proposed Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) is the hypothetical common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, spoken by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became certain enough to establish its relationship to PIE. Using the method of [[internal reconstruction]] an earlier stage, called [[Pre-Proto-Indo-European]], has been proposed.\n\nPIE was an [[inflected language]], in which the grammatical relationships between words were signaled through inflectional morphemes (usually endings). The [[root (linguistics)|roots]] of PIE are basic [[morpheme]]s carrying a [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] meaning. By addition of [[suffix]]es, they form [[stem (linguistics)|stems]], and by addition of [[Ending (linguistics)|endings]], these form grammatically inflected words ([[Indo-European noun|nouns]] or [[Indo-European verb|verbs]]).

Mycenaean Greek is the oldest recorded form, but its value is lessened by the limited material, restricted subject matter, and highly ambiguous writing system. More important is Ancient Greek, documented extensively beginning with the two [[Homeric poems]] (the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', c. 750 BC).\n* [[Hittite language|Hittite]] (c. 1700 \u2013 1200 BC). This is the earliest-recorded of all Indo-European languages, and highly divergent from the others due to the early separation of the [[Anatolian languages]] from the remainder. It possesses some highly archaic features found only fragmentarily, if at all, in other languages. At the same time, however, it appears to have undergone a large number of early phonological and grammatical changes which, combined with the ambiguities of its writing system, hinder its usefulness somewhat.\n\nOther primary sources:\n* [[Latin]], attested in a huge amount of poetic and prose material in the [[Classical Latin|Classical]] period (c. 200 BC \u2013 100 AD) and limited [[Old Latin|older material]] from as early as c. 600 BC.\n* [[Gothic language|Gothic]] (the most archaic well-documented [[Germanic language]], c. 350 AD), along with the combined witness of the other old Germanic languages: most importantly, [[Old English]] (c. 800 \u2013 1000 AD), [[Old High German]] (c. 750 \u2013 1000 AD) and [[Old Norse]] (c. 1100 \u2013 1300 AD, with limited earlier sources dating all the way back to c. 200 AD).\n* [[Old Avestan]] (c. 1700 \u2013 1200 BC) and [[Avestan language|Younger Avestan]] (c. 900 BC). Documentation is sparse, but nonetheless quite important due to its highly archaic nature.\n* Modern [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], with limited records in [[Old Lithuanian]] (c. 1500 \u2013 1700 AD).\n* [[Old Church Slavonic]] (c. 900 \u2013 1000 AD).\n\nOther secondary sources, of lesser value due to poor attestation:\n* [[Luwian language|Luwian]], [[Lycian language|Lycian]], [[Lydian language|Lydian]] and other [[Anatolian languages]] (c. 1400 \u2013 400 BC).\n* [[Oscan]], [[Umbrian]] and other [[Italic languages|Old Italic]] languages (c. 600 \u2013 200 BC).\n* [[Old Persian]] (c. 500 BC).\n* [[Old Prussian]] (c. 1350 \u2013 1600 AD); even more archaic than Lithuanian.\n\nOther secondary sources, of lesser value{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} due to extensive phonological changes and relatively limited attestation:\n* [[Old Irish]] (c. 700 \u2013 850 AD).\n* [[Tocharian language|Tocharian]] (c. 500 \u2013 800 AD), underwent large phonetic shifts and mergers in the proto-language, and has an almost entirely reworked declension system.\n* [[Classical Armenian]] (c. 400 \u2013 1100 AD).\n* [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (c. 1450 \u2013 current time).\n\n===Sound changes===\n{{Main|Indo-European sound laws}}\nAs the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language broke up, its sound system diverged as well, changing according to various [[sound law]]s evidenced in the [[daughter language]]s.\n\nPIE is normally reconstructed with a complex system of 15 [[stop consonant]]s, including an unusual three-way [[phonation]] ([[voice (phonetics)|voicing]]) distinction between [[voicelessness|voiceless]], [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and \"[[voiced aspirated]]\" (i.e. [[breathy voiced]]) stops, and a three-way distinction among [[velar consonant]]s (''k''-type sounds) between \"palatal\" ''\u1e31 \u01f5 \u01f5h'', \"plain velar\" ''k g gh'' and [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]] ''k\u02b7 g\u02b7 g\u02b7h''. (The correctness of the terms ''palatal'' and ''plain velar'' is disputed; see [[Proto-Indo-European phonology]].)  All daughter languages have reduced the number of distinctions among these sounds, often in divergent ways.\n\nAs an example, in [[English language|English]], one of the [[Germanic language]]s, the following are some of the major changes that happened:\n{{ordered list\n|1= As in other [[centum]] languages, the \"plain velar\" and \"palatal\" stops merged, reducing the number of stops from 15 to 12.\n|2= As in the other Germanic languages, the [[Germanic sound shift]] changed the realization of all stop consonants, with each consonant shifting to a different one:\n: {{PIE|b\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|b}} \u2192 {{PIE|p}} \u2192 {{PIE|f}}\n: {{PIE|d\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|d}} \u2192 {{PIE|t}} \u2192 {{PIE|\u03b8}}\n: {{PIE|g\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|g}} \u2192 {{PIE|k}} \u2192 {{PIE|x}} (Later initial {{PIE|x}} \u2192{{PIE|h}})\n: {{PIE|g\u02b7\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|g\u02b7}} \u2192 {{PIE|k\u02b7}} \u2192 {{PIE|x\u02b7}} (Later initial {{PIE|x\u02b7}} \u2192{{PIE|h\u02b7}})\nEach original consonant shifted one position to the right.  For example, original {{PIE|d\u02b0}} became {{PIE|d}}, while original {{PIE|d}} became {{PIE|t}} and original {{PIE|t}} became {{PIE|\u03b8}} (written ''th'' in English).  This is the original source of the English sounds written ''f'', ''th'', ''h'' and ''wh''.  Examples, comparing English with Latin, where the sounds largely remain unshifted:\n:For PIE ''p'': ''piscis'' vs. ''fish''; ''p\u0113s, p\u0113dis'' vs. ''foot''; ''pluvium'' \"rain\" vs. ''flow''; ''pater'' vs. ''father''\n:For PIE ''t'': ''tr\u0113s'' vs. ''three''; ''m\u0101ter'' vs. ''mother''\n:For PIE ''d'': ''decem'' vs. ''ten''; ''p\u0113dis'' vs. ''foot''; ''quid'' vs. ''what''\n:For PIE ''k'': ''centum'' vs. ''hund(red)''; ''capere'' \"to take\" vs. ''have''\n:For PIE ''k\u02b7'': ''quid'' vs. ''what''; ''quand\u014d'' vs. ''when''\n|3= Various further changes affected consonants in the middle or end of a word:\n* The voiced stops resulting from the sound shift were softened to voiced [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] (or perhaps the sound shift directly generated fricatives in these positions).\n* [[Verner's law]] also turned some of the voiceless fricatives resulting from the sound shift into voiced fricatives or stops.  This is why the ''t'' in Latin ''centum'' ends up as ''d'' in ''hund(red)'' rather than the expected ''th''.\n* Most remaining ''h'' sounds disappeared, while remaining ''f'' and ''th'' became voiced.  For example, Latin ''decem'' ends up as ''ten'' with no ''h'' in the middle (but note ''ta\u00edhun'' \"ten\" in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], an archaic Germanic language).  Similarly, the words ''seven'' and ''have'' have a voiced ''v'' (compare Latin ''septem'', ''capere''), while ''father'' and ''mother'' have a voiced ''th'', although not spelled differently (compare Latin ''pater'', ''m\u0101ter'').\n}}\n\nNone of the daughter-language families (except possibly [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], particularly [[Luvian language|Luvian]]) reflect the plain velar stops differently from the other two series, and there is even a certain amount of dispute whether this series existed at all in PIE.  The major distinction between [[Centum-satem isogloss|''centum'' and ''satem'']] languages corresponds to the outcome of the PIE plain velars:\n* The \"central\" ''satem'' languages ([[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) reflect both \"plain velar\" and labiovelar stops as plain velars, often with secondary [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] before a [[front vowel]] (''e i \u0113 \u012b'').  The \"palatal\" stops are palatalized and often appear as [[sibilant]]s (usually but not always distinct from the secondarily palatalized stops).\n* The \"peripheral\" ''centum'' languages ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian language|Tocharian]]) reflect both \"palatal\" and \"plain velar\" stops as plain velars, while the labiovelars continue unchanged, often with later reduction into plain [[labial consonant|labial]] or [[velar consonant]]s.\n\nThe three-way PIE distinction between voiceless, voiced and voiced aspirated stops is considered extremely unusual from the perspective of [[linguistic typology]]\u2014particularly in the existence of voiced aspirated stops without a corresponding series of voiceless aspirated stops. None of the various daughter-language families continue it unchanged, with numerous \"solutions\" to the apparently unstable PIE situation:\n* The [[Indo-Aryan language]]s preserve the three series unchanged but have evolved a fourth series of voiceless aspirated consonants.\n* The [[Iranian language]]s probably passed through the same stage, subsequently changing the aspirated stops into fricatives.\n* [[Greek language|Greek]] converted the voiced aspirates into voiceless aspirates.\n* [[Italic languages|Italic]] probably passed through the same stage, but reflects the voiced aspirates as voiceless fricatives, especially ''f'' (or sometimes plain voiced stops in [[Latin]]).\n* [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] merge the voiced aspirated into plain voiced stops.\n* [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] change all three series in a [[chain shift]] (e.g. with ''bh b p'' becoming ''b p f'' (known as ''[[Grimm's law]]'' in Germanic).\n\nAmong the other notable changes affecting consonants are:\n* The [[Ruki sound law]] (''s'' becomes {{IPA|/\u0283/}} before ''r, u, k, i'') in the ''[[satem]]'' languages.\n* Loss of prevocalic ''p'' in [[Proto-Celtic]].\n* Development of prevocalic ''s'' to ''h'' in [[Proto-Greek]], with later loss of ''h'' between vowels.\n* [[Verner's law]] in [[Proto-Germanic]].\n* [[Grassmann's law]] (dissimilation of aspirates) independently in Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian.\n\nThe following table shows the basic outcomes of PIE consonants in some of the most important daughter languages for the purposes of reconstruction.

Some IE languages have moved from [[synthetic language|synthetic]] verb systems to largely [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] systems. In addition, the [[pronoun]]s of periphrastic forms are in brackets when they appear. Some of these verbs have undergone a change in meaning as well.\n* In Modern Irish ''beir'' usually only carries the meaning ''to bear'' in the sense of bearing a child; its common meanings are ''to catch, grab''.\n* The Hindi verb ''bharn\u0101'', the continuation of the Sanskrit verb, can have a variety of meanings, but the most common is \"to fill\". The forms given in the table, although etymologically derived from the present indicative, now have the meaning of [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]].  The present indicative is conjugated periphrastically, using a participle (etymologically the Sanskrit present participle ''bharant-'') and an auxiliary: ''mai\u1e43 bhart\u0101 h\u016b\u1e43, t\u016b bhart\u0101 hai, vah bhart\u0101 hai, ham bharte hai\u1e43, tum bharte ho, ve bharte hai\u1e43'' (masculine forms).\n* German is not directly descended from Gothic, but the Gothic forms are a close approximation of what the early West Germanic forms of c. 400 AD would have looked like.  The cognate of Germanic ''beranan'' (English ''bear'') survives in German only in the compound ''geb\u00e4ren'', meaning \"bear (a child)\".\n* The Latin verb ''ferre'' is irregular, and not a good representative of a normal thematic verb. In most Romance Languages such as French, other verbs now mean \"to carry\" (e.g. Fr. ''porter'' < Lat. ''portare'') and ''ferre'' was only borrowed and nativized in compounds such as ''souffrir'' \"to suffer\" (from Latin ''sub-'' and ''ferre'') and {{lang|fr|conf\u00e9rer}} \"to confer\" (from Latin \"con-\" and \"ferre\"). \n* In Modern [[Greek language|Greek]], ''phero'' \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 (modern transliteration ''fero'') \"to bear\" is still used but only in specific contexts and is most common in such compounds as \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b5\u03ba\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 etc. The form that is (very) common today is ''pherno'' \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03c9 (modern transliteration ''ferno'') meaning \"to bring\". Additionally, the perfective form of ''pherno'' (used for the subjunctive voice and also for the future tense) is also ''phero''.\n* In Modern [[Russian language|Russian]] ''\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c'' (brat') carries the meaning ''to take''. ''\u0411\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f'' (br'em'a) means ''burden'', as something heavy to bear, and derivative ''\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c'' (b'er'em'ennost') means ''pregnancy''.\n\n== Comparison of cognates ==\n{{Main|Indo-European vocabulary}}\n{{See also|Proto-Indo-European numerals|List of numbers in various languages}}\n\n==Present distribution==\n[[File:Indo-European-speaking world.png|thumb|left|upright=1.55|{{legend|#013857|Official or Primary Language}}{{legend|#0371b0|Secondary Official Language}}{{legend|#80a4c0|Recognized}}{{legend|#ccd2e8|Significant}}{{legend|#e5e5e5|No use}}]]\n\n[[File:Languages of North America.svg|thumb|upright=0.95|The approximate present-day distribution of Indo-European languages within the Americas by country:<br />\n[[Romance languages|Romance]]:\n{{legend|#3EBA00|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]}}\n{{legend|#EA6500|[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]\u2013[[Galician language|Galician]]}}\n{{legend|#001E96|[[French language|French]]}}\n[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]:\n{{legend|#C60000|[[English language|English]]}}\n{{legend|#FFD000|[[Dutch language|Dutch]]}} ]]\nToday, Indo-European languages are spoken by almost 3 billion [[Native speaker#Defining \"native speaker\"|native speakers]] across all inhabited continents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=family |title=Ethnologue list of language families |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> the largest number by far for any recognised language family.

The ancient [[Indo-European migrations]] and widespread dissemination of [[Indo-European culture]] throughout [[Eurasia]], including that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] themselves, and that of their daughter cultures including the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryans]], [[Iranian peoples]], [[Celts]], [[Hellenistic period|Greeks]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Germanic peoples]], and [[Slavs]], led to these peoples' branches of the language family already taking a dominant foothold in virtually all of Eurasia except for [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]] by the end of the prehistoric era, replacing the previously-spoken [[pre-Indo-European languages]] of this extensive area.\n\nDespite being unaware of their common linguistic origin, diverse groups of Indo-European speakers continued to culturally dominate and replace the indigenous languages of the western two-thirds of Eurasia. By the beginning of the [[Common Era]], Indo-European peoples controlled almost the entirety of this area: the Celts western and central Europe, the Romans southern Europe, the Germanic peoples northern Europe, the Slavs eastern Europe, the Iranian peoples the entirety of western and central Asia and parts of eastern Europe, and the Indo-Aryan peoples in the [[Indian subcontinent]], with the [[Tocharians]] inhabiting the Indo-European frontier in western China. By the medieval period, only the [[Vasconic]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] and [[Uralic languages]] remained of the (relatively) [[Paleo-European languages|indigenous languages of Europe]] and the western half of Asia.\n\nDespite medieval invasions by [[Eurasian nomads]], a group to which the Proto-Indo-Europeans had once belonged, Indo-European expansion reached another peak in the [[early modern period]] with the dramatic increase in the population of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and European expansionism throughout the globe during the [[Age of Discovery]], as well as the continued replacement and assimilation of surrounding non-Indo-European languages and peoples due to increased state centralization and [[nationalism]]. These trends compounded throughout the modern period due to the general global [[population growth]] and the results of [[European colonization]] of the [[Western Hemisphere]] and [[Oceania]], leading to an explosion in the number of Indo-European speakers as well as the territories inhabited by them.\n\nDue to colonization and the modern dominance of Indo-European languages in the fields of global science, technology, education, finance, and sports, even many modern countries whose populations largely speak non-Indo-European languages have Indo-European languages as official languages, and the majority of the global population speaks at least one Indo-European language.

The [[Port of Chicago]] connects the state to other global ports around the world from the [[Great Lakes]], via the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; as well as the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Mississippi River]], via the [[Illinois Waterway]] on the [[Illinois River]]. The Mississippi River, the [[Ohio River]], and the [[Wabash River]] form parts of the boundaries of Illinois. For decades, Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]] has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a [[bellwether]] both in [[Will it play in Peoria?|social and cultural terms]]<ref name=\"so\" /> and [[swing states|politics]].\n\nThe capital of Illinois is [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] in central Illinois. Although today, the state's largest population center is in and around Chicago in the northeastern part of the state, the state's European population grew first in the west, with French who settled along the [[Mississippi River]], and gave the area the name [[Illinois Country|''Illinois'' Country]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War]] established the United States, American settlers began arriving from [[Kentucky]] in the 1780s via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north. In 1818, Illinois achieved [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|statehood]]. After construction of the [[Erie Canal]] increased traffic and trade through the Great Lakes, Chicago was founded in the 1830s on the banks of the [[Chicago River]], at one of the few natural harbors on southern [[Lake Michigan]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516035020/http://www.chipublib.org/digital/lake/CFDHarbor.html]</ref> [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]]'s invention of the self-scouring [[plough|steel plow]] turned Illinois's rich [[prairie]] into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmland, attracting [[immigrant]] farmers from [[German American|Germany]] and [[Swedish American|Sweden]]. The [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] (1848) made transportation between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River valley faster and cheaper. New railroads carried immigrants to new homes, as well as being used to ship commodity crops to Eastern markets. The state became a transportation hub for the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/1999/iht639920.html|title=The Historical Development of Transportation in Illinois|last=Ryburn-LaMonte|first=Terri|date=1999|website=Illinois Periodicals Online|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBy 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and [[coal]] mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and Southern Europe.

The name \"Illinois\" derives from the Miami-Illinois verb ''irenwe\u00b7wa'' - \"he speaks the regular way\". This was taken into the [[Ojibwe language]], perhaps in the [[Ottawa dialect]], and modified into ''ilinwe\u00b7'' (pluralized as ''ilinwe\u00b7k'').

However, as Indiana had successfully been granted a {{Convert|10|mi|adj=on}} northern extension of its boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront, the original bill for Illinois statehood, submitted to Congress on January 23, 1818, stipulated a northern border at the same latitude as Indiana's, which is defined as 10 miles north of the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan. But the Illinois delegate, [[Nathaniel Pope]], wanted more. Pope lobbied to have the boundary moved further north, and the final bill passed by Congress did just that; it included an amendment to shift the border to 42\u00b0 30' north, which is approximately {{convert|51|mi}} north of the Indiana northern border. This shift added {{convert|8500|sqmi|4=-2}} to the state, including the [[lead mining]] region near [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]].

Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of [[Cahokia]], as well as the site of the first state capital at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.<ref name=\"Nelson\"/><ref name=\"Horsley\">{{cite book |last=Horsley |first=A. Doyne |title=Illinois: A Geography |year=1986 |publisher=Westview Press|location= Boulder|isbn=978-0-86531-522-8 }}</ref> This region has a somewhat warmer winter climate, different variety of crops (including some cotton farming in the past), more rugged topography (due to the area remaining unglaciated during the [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinoian Stage]], unlike most of the rest of the state), as well as small-scale oil deposits and coal mining. The Illinois suburbs of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], such as [[East St. Louis]], are located in this region, and collectively, they are known as the [[Metro-East]]. The other somewhat significant concentration of population in Southern Illinois is the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]] and [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]], a two-county area that is home to 123,272 residents.<ref name=\"Nelson\"/> A portion of southeastern Illinois is part of the extended [[Evansville, Indiana]], Metro Area, locally referred to as the Tri-State with Indiana and Kentucky. Seven Illinois counties are in the area.\n\nIn addition to these three, largely latitudinally defined divisions, all of the region outside the Chicago Metropolitan area is often called \"[[Downstate Illinois|downstate]]\" Illinois. This term is flexible, but is generally meant to mean everything outside the influence of the Chicago area. Thus, some cities in ''Northern'' Illinois, such as [[DeKalb, Illinois|DeKalb]], which is west of Chicago, and [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]]\u2014which is actually ''north'' of Chicago\u2014are considered to be \"downstate\".\n\n===Climate===\n{{main|Climate of Illinois}}\n[[File:IL_koppen.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of Illinois]]\n\nIllinois has a climate that varies widely throughout the year. Because of its nearly 400-mile distance between its northernmost and southernmost extremes, as well as its mid-continental situation, most of Illinois has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), with hot, humid summers and cold winters. The southern part of the state, from about [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]] southward, has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Koppen ''Cfa''), with more moderate winters. Average yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from just over {{convert|48|in|0}} at the southern tip to around {{convert|35|in|0}} in the northern portion of the state. Normal annual snowfall exceeds {{convert|38|in|0}} in the Chicago area, while the southern portion of the state normally receives less than {{convert|14|in|0}}.<ref name=\"Climate_Maps\">[http://www.sws.uiuc.edu/atmos/statecli/index.htm Illinois State Climatologist Office].

Bush]] became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying either Illinois or [[Vermont]]. Local politician and Chicago resident [[Barack Obama]] easily won the state's 21 electoral votes in 2008, with 61.9% of the vote. In 2010, incumbent Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] was re-elected with 47% of the vote, while Republican Mark Kirk was elected to the Senate with 48% of the vote. In 2012, President Obama easily carried Illinois again, with 58% to Republican candidate [[Mitt Romney]]'s 41%.

Thompson]]. In 2006, former Governor [[George Ryan]] was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. In 2008, then-Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] was served with a criminal complaint on corruption charges, stemming from allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President [[Barack Obama]] to the highest bidder. Subsequently, on December 7, 2011, [[Rod Blagojevich]] was sentenced to 14 years in prison for those charges, as well as perjury while testifying during the case, totaling 18 convictions. Blagojevich was impeached and convicted by the legislature, resulting in his removal from office. In the late 20th century, Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]] was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge [[Otto Kerner, Jr.]] was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State [[Paul Powell (politician)|Paul Powell]] was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) [[Orville Hodge]] was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor [[Len Small]] was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.<ref name=\"Biles\"/><ref name=\"Horsley\"/><ref>{{cite book |title= Grafters and Goo Goos: corruption and reform in Chicago, 1833\u20132003|last= Merriner|first= James L.|year= 2004|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location= Carbondale|isbn= 978-0-8093-2571-9|oclc= 52720998}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ Presidential elections results\n!Year\n![[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n![[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 2016|2016]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |38.76% ''2,146,015''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |'''55.83%''' ''3,090,729''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 2012|2012]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |40.66% ''2,135,216''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |'''57.50%''' ''3,019,512''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |36.73% ''2,031,179''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |'''61.83%''' ''3,419,348''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |44.48% ''2,345,946''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |'''54.82%''' ''2,891,550''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |42.58% ''2,019,421''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |'''54.60%''' ''2,589,026''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |36.81% ''1,587,021''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |'''54.32%''' ''2,341,744''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |34.34% ''1,734,096''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |'''48.58%''' ''2,453,350''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |'''50.69%''' ''2,310,939''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |48.60% ''2,215,940''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |'''56.17%''' ''2,707,103''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |43.30% ''2,086,499''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |'''49.65%''' ''2,359,049''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |41.72% ''1,981,413''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |'''50.10%''' ''2,364,269''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |48.13% ''2,271,295''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 1972|1972]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |'''59.03%''' ''2,788,179''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |40.51% ''1,913,472''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |'''47.08%''' ''2,174,774''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |44.15% ''2,039,814''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |40.53% ''1,905,946''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |'''59.47%''' ''2,796,833''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |[[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960]]\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fff3f3\" |49.80% ''2,368,988''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0ff\" |'''49.98%''' ''2,377,846''\n|}\n\n===U.S. Presidential Elections===\nIllinois has shown a strong presence in presidential elections. Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base when running for president: [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and most recently [[Barack Obama]]. Lincoln was born in [[Kentucky]], but he moved to Illinois at age 21. He served in the [[Illinois General Assembly|General Assembly]] and represented the [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] before his election to the presidency in 1860. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was born in [[Ohio]] and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and approaching middle age, he moved to Illinois and thus utilized the state as his home and political base when running for President. [[Barack Obama]] was born in [[Hawaii]] and made Illinois his home after graduating from [[law school]], and later represented Illinois in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He then became president in 2008, running as a candidate from his Illinois base.\n\n[[Ronald Reagan]] was born in Illinois, in the city of [[Tampico, Illinois|Tampico]], raised in [[Dixon, Illinois]], and educated at [[Eureka College]], outside [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]. Reagan later moved to [[California]] during his young adulthood. He then became an actor, and later became [[Governor of California|California's Governor]] before being elected president.\n\n[[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and became the first (and only woman thus far) to represent a major political party in the general election of the U.S. presidency. Clinton ran from a platform based in [[New York (state)|New York State]].\n\n===African-American U.S. senators===\n[[List of African-American United States Senators|Nine African-Americans]] have served as members of the [[United States Senate]]. Three of them have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: [[Carol Moseley Braun|Carol Moseley-Braun]], [[Barack Obama]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Art & History Home |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> and [[Roland Burris]], who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.\n[[File:Bruce Rauner August 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Bruce Rauner]] [[Republican Party (United States)|(R)]], current [[Governor of Illinois]]]]\n\n===Political families===\nTwo families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], gaining both statewide and national fame.\n\n====Stevensons====\nThe [[Stevenson family]], initially rooted in central Illinois and later based in the Chicago metropolitan area, has provided four generations of Illinois officeholders.\n* [[Adlai Stevenson I]] (1835\u20131914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a [[Congressman]]\n* [[Lewis Stevenson (politician)|Lewis Stevenson]] (1868\u20131929), son of Adlai, served as [[Illinois Secretary of State]].\n* [[Adlai Stevenson II]] (1900\u20131965), son of Lewis, served as [[Governor of Illinois]] and as the US Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party's presidential nominee in [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]], losing both elections to [[Dwight Eisenhower]].\n* [[Adlai Stevenson III]] (1930\u2013 ), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a [[United States Senator]].\n\n====Daleys====\nThe [[Daley family]]'s powerbase was in Chicago.\n* [[Richard J. Daley]] (1902\u20131976) served as [[Mayor of Chicago]] from 1955 to his death.\n* [[Richard M. Daley]] (1942\u2013 ), son of Richard J, was Chicago's longest serving mayor, in office from 1989 to 2011.\n* [[William M. Daley]] (1948\u2013 ), another son of Richard J, is a former [[White House Chief of Staff]] and has served in a variety of appointed positions.\n\n==Education==\n\n===Illinois State Board of education===\n{{main|Illinois State Board of Education}}\n\nThe Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers [[public education]] in the state. Local municipalities and their respective [[school district]]s operate individual public schools, but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the [[Illinois School Report Card]]. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\n{{see also|List of school districts in Illinois|List of high schools in Illinois}}\n\nEducation is compulsory from ages 7 to 17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly, but not exclusively, divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, [[middle school]] or [[Middle school|junior high school]], and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in ''two'' school districts\u2014one for high school, the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n{{mainlist|List of colleges and universities in Illinois}}\n\n[[File:MainLibrary Urbana Illinois 4582.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The [[Main Library (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)|Main Library]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] is home to [[The Rare Book & Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign)|the Rare Book & Manuscript Library]].]]\nUsing the criterion established by [[the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], there are eleven \"National Universities\" in the state. {{As of|2010|8|19}}, six of these rank in the \"first tier\" (that is, the top quartile) among the top 500 National Universities in the United States, as determined by the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings: the [[University of Chicago]] (4), [[Northwestern University]] (12), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] (41), [[Loyola University Chicago]] (89), the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (108), [[DePaul University]] (123), [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (129), [[Illinois State University]] (149), [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (153), and [[Northern Illinois University]] (194).<ref name=\"usnews\">{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|title=Best Colleges 2010 \u2013 National Universities Rankings|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=May 31, 2016|website=[[U.S. News & World Report]]}}</ref>\n\nThe University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world's top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its [[Booth School of Business]], along with Northwestern's [[Kellogg School of Management]] consistently rank within the top 5 graduate business schools in the country and top 10 globally. The University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign is often ranked among the best engineering schools in the world and in United States.\n\nIllinois also has more than 20 additional [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] four-year universities, both public and private, and dozens of small [[liberal arts college]]s across the state. Additionally, Illinois supports 49 public [[community college]]s in the [[Illinois Community College System]].\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transportation===\n{{see also|List of airports in Illinois|List of Illinois Routes|List of Illinois railroads|Category:Illinois waterways}}\n\nBecause of its central location and its proximity to the [[Rust Belt]] and [[Grain Belt]], Illinois is a national crossroads for air, auto, rail, and truck traffic.\n\n====Airports====\n[[File:Champaign Airport.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Illinois Willard Airport]]]]\nFrom 1962 until 1998, Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]] (ORD) was the busiest airport in the world, measured both in terms of total flights and passengers. While it was surpassed by [[Atlanta]]'s [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield]] in 1998 (as Chicago splits its air traffic between O'Hare and Midway airports, while Atlanta only uses one airport), with 59.3&nbsp;million domestic passengers annually, along with 11.4&nbsp;million international passengers in 2008,<ref>{{cite web|title=O'Hare International Airport Activity Statistics |url=http://www.flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208ORDSUMMARY-REVISED.pdf |website= |publisher=City of Chicago: FlyChicago.com |date=March 27, 2009 |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101054630/http://flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208ORDSUMMARY-REVISED.pdf |archivedate=January 1, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> O'Hare consistently remains one of the two or three busiest airports globally, and in some years still ranks number one in total flights.

[[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway Airport]] (MDW), which had been the busiest airport in the world at one point until it was supplanted by O'Hare as the busiest airport in 1962, is now the secondary airport in the Chicago metropolitan area and still ranks as one of the nation's busiest airports. Midway is a major hub for [[Southwest Airlines]] and services many other carriers as well.

Chicago is a national [[Amtrak]] hub and in-state passengers are served by Amtrak's [[Illinois Service]], featuring the Chicago to Carbondale [[Illini (Amtrak)|''Illini'']] and [[Saluki (Amtrak)|''Saluki'']], the Chicago to Quincy [[Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg|''Carl Sandburg'']] and ''[[Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg|Illinois Zephyr]]'', and the Chicago to St. Louis ''[[Lincoln Service]]''. Currently there is trackwork on the Chicago\u2013St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to {{convert|110|mph|abbr=on}}, which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive commuter rail is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Chicago \"L\"|'L']] system. One of the largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by [[Metra]], uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.\n\nIn addition to the state's rail lines, the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Illinois River]] provide major transportation routes for the state's agricultural interests.

This additional structure associates each pair of vectors in the space with a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] quantity known as the inner product of the vectors. Inner products allow the rigorous introduction of intuitive geometrical notions such as the length of a vector or the [[angle]] between two vectors. They also provide the means of defining [[orthogonality]] between vectors (zero inner product). Inner product spaces generalize [[Euclidean space]]s (in which the inner product is the [[dot product]], also known as the scalar product) to vector spaces of any (possibly infinite) [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]], and are studied in [[functional analysis]]. The first usage of the concept of a vector space with an inner product is due to Peano, in 1898.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Gregory H.|title=The axiomatization of linear algebra: 1875-1940|journal=Historia Mathematica|date=1995|volume=22|issue=3|pages=262\u2013303|doi=10.1006/hmat.1995.1025}}</ref>\n\nAn inner product naturally induces an associated [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]], thus an inner product space is also a [[normed vector space]]. A [[complete space]] with an inner product is called a [[Hilbert space]]. An (incomplete) space with an inner product is called a '''pre-Hilbert space''', since its [[Complete space#Completion|completion]] with respect to the norm induced by the inner product is a [[Hilbert space]]. Inner product spaces over the field of complex numbers are sometimes referred to as '''unitary spaces'''.\n\n== Definition ==\nIn this article, the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s denoted {{math|''F''}} is either the field of [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}} or the field of [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}}.\n\nFormally, an inner product space is a [[vector space]] {{math|''V''}} [[Algebra over a field|over the field]] {{math|''F''}} together with an ''inner product'', i.e., with a map\n:<math> \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle : V \\times V \\to F </math>\n\nthat satisfies the following three [[axiom]]s for all vectors {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z'' \u2208 ''V''}} and all scalars {{math|''a'' \u2208 ''F''}}:<ref name= Jain>{{cite book |title=Functional Analysis |first1=P.

Then the first argument becomes conjugate linear, rather than the second. In those disciplines we would write the product {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''y''}}}} as {{math|{{bra-ket|''y''|''x''}}}} (the [[bra\u2013ket notation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]), respectively {{math|''y''<sup>\u2020</sup>''x''}} (dot product as a case of the convention of forming the matrix product {{math|''AB''}} as the dot products of rows of {{math|''A''}} with columns of {{math|''B''}}). Here the kets and columns are identified with the vectors of {{math|''V''}} and the bras and rows with the [[linear functional]]s (covectors) of the [[dual space]] {{math|''V''{{isup|\u2217}}}}, with conjugacy associated with duality. This reverse order is now occasionally followed in the more abstract literature,<ref>{{cite book|last=Emch|first=Gerard G.|title=Algebraic Methods in Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory|year=1972|publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-23900-0}}</ref> taking {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''y''}}}} to be conjugate linear in {{math|''x''}} rather than {{math|''y''}}. A few instead find a middle ground by recognizing both {{math|{{angbr|\u00b7,\u00b7}}}} and {{math|{{bra-ket|\u00b7|\u00b7}}}} as distinct notations differing only in which argument is conjugate linear.\n\nThere are various technical reasons why it is necessary to restrict the [[basefield]] to {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} in the definition. Briefly, the basefield has to contain an [[ordered field|ordered subfield]] in order for non-negativity to make sense,<ref>{{citation|title=Introduction to Matrices and Linear Transformations|edition=3rd|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first=Daniel T.|last=Finkbeiner|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-f_DAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA242|page=242|isbn=9780486279664}}.</ref> and therefore has to have [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] equal to 0 (since any ordered field has to have such characteristic). This immediately excludes finite fields. The basefield has to have additional structure, such as a distinguished automorphism. More generally any quadratically closed subfield of {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}} will suffice for this purpose, e.g., the [[algebraic number]]s or the [[Constructible_number#Transformation_into_algebra|constructible number]]s. However in these cases when it is a proper subfield (i.e., neither {{math|'''R'''}} nor {{math|'''C'''}}) even finite-dimensional inner product spaces will fail to be metrically complete. In contrast all finite-dimensional inner product spaces over {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}, such as those used in [[quantum computation]], are automatically [[Complete metric space|metrically complete]] and hence [[Hilbert space]]s.\n\nIn some cases we need to consider non-negative ''semi-definite'' sesquilinear forms. This means that {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''x''}}}} is only required to be non-negative. We show how to treat these below.\n\n=== Elementary properties ===\nWhen {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''R'''}}, conjugate symmetry reduces to symmetry. That is, {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''y''}} {{=}} {{angbr|''y'',''x''}}}} for {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''R'''}}; while for {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''C'''}}, {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''y''}}}} is equal to the [[complex conjugate]].\n\nNotice that conjugate symmetry implies that {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''x''}}}} is real for all {{math|''x''}}, since we have:\n\n:<math>\\langle x,x \\rangle = \\overline{\\langle x,x \\rangle} \\,.</math>\n\nMoreover, sesquilinearity (see below) implies that\n\n:<math> \\langle -x,x \\rangle= -1\\langle x,x\\rangle = \\overline{-1}\\langle x,x\\rangle = \\langle x,-x\\rangle \\,.</math>\n\nConjugate symmetry and linearity in the first variable gives\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle x, a y \\rangle &= \\overline{\\langle a y, x \\rangle} = \\overline{a} \\overline{\\langle y, x \\rangle} = \\overline{a} \\langle x, y \\rangle \\\\\n\\langle x, y + z \\rangle &= \\overline{\\langle y + z, x \\rangle} = \\overline{\\langle y, x \\rangle} + \\overline{\\langle z, x \\rangle} = \\langle x, y \\rangle + \\langle x, z \\rangle \\,,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nso an inner product is a [[sesquilinear]] form. Conjugate symmetry is also called Hermitian symmetry, and a conjugate symmetric sesquilinear form is called a ''Hermitian form''. While the above axioms are more mathematically economical, a compact verbal definition of an inner product is a ''positive-definite Hermitian form''.\n\nIn the case of {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''R'''}}, conjugate-symmetry reduces to symmetry, and sesquilinear reduces to bilinear. So, an inner product on a real vector space is a ''positive-definite symmetric bilinear form''.\n\nFrom the linearity property it is derived that {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} implies {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''x''}} {{=}} 0}}. while from the positive-definiteness axiom we obtain the converse, {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''x''}} {{=}} 0}} implies {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}. Combining these two, we have the property that {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''x''}} {{=}} 0}} if and only if {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nCombining the linearity of the inner product in its first argument and the conjugate symmetry gives the following important generalization of the familiar square expansion:\n:<math>\\langle x + y,x + y\\rangle = \\langle x,x\\rangle + \\langle x,y\\rangle + \\langle y,x\\rangle + \\langle y,y\\rangle \\,.</math>\nAssuming the underlying field to be {{math|'''R'''}}, the inner product becomes symmetric, and we obtain\n:<math>\\langle x \\pm y,x \\pm y\\rangle =\\langle x,x\\rangle \\pm 2\\langle x,y\\rangle + \\langle y,y\\rangle \\,,</math>\nThe property of an inner product space {{math|''V''}} that\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle x+y,z\\rangle&= \\langle x,z\\rangle+ \\langle y,z\\rangle \\,, \\\\\n\\langle x,y+z\\rangle &= \\langle x,y\\rangle + \\langle x,z\\rangle\n\\end{align}</math>\nis also known as ''additivity''.\n\n== Examples ==\n===Real numbers===\n\nA simple example is the [[real numbers]] with the standard multiplication as the inner product\n:<math>\\langle x,y\\rangle := x y.</math>\n\n===Euclidean space===\n\nMore generally, the [[real coordinate space|real {{math|''n''}}-space]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} with the [[dot product]] is an inner product space, an example of a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space]].\n:<math>\\left\\langle \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_n \\end{bmatrix},\\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{bmatrix} \\right\\rangle := x^\\mathsf{T} y = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i = x_1 y_1 + \\cdots + x_n y_n,</math>\nwhere {{math|''x''<sup>T</sup>}} is the [[transpose]] of {{math|''x''}}.\n\n===Complex coordinate space===\n\nThe general form of an inner product on {{math|'''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is known as the [[Hermitian form]] and is given by\n:<math>\\langle \\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle := \\mathbf{y}^\\dagger\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{x} = \\overline{\\mathbf{x}^\\dagger\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{y}},</math>\nwhere {{math|'''M'''}} is any [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] [[positive-definite matrix]] and {{math|'''y'''<sup>\u2020</sup>}} is the [[conjugate transpose]] of {{math|'''y'''}}. For the real case this corresponds to the dot product of the results of directionally different [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] of the two vectors, with positive [[scale factor]]s and orthogonal directions of scaling. Up to an orthogonal transformation it is a [[Weight function|weighted-sum]] version of the dot product, with positive weights.\n\n===Hilbert space===\n\nThe article on [[Hilbert space]] has several examples of inner product spaces wherein the metric induced by the inner product yields a [[complete space|complete]] metric space. An example of an inner product which induces an incomplete metric occurs with the space {{math|''C''([''a'',''b''])}} of continuous complex valued functions on the interval {{math|[''a'',''b'']}}. The inner product is\n:<math> \\langle f , g \\rangle := \\int_a^b f(t) \\overline{g(t)} \\, \\mathrm{d}t. </math>\nThis space is not complete; consider for example, for the interval {{closed-closed|\u22121,1}} the sequence of continuous \"step\" functions, {{math|{&thinsp;''f<sub>k</sub>''}<sub>''k''</sub>}}, defined by:\n:<math> f_k(t) = \\begin{cases} 0 & t \\in [-1,0] \\\\ 1 & t \\in \\left [\\tfrac{1}{k}, 1 \\right ] \\\\ kt & t \\in \\left (0, \\tfrac{1}{k} \\right) \\end{cases}</math>\nThis sequence is a [[Cauchy sequence]] for the norm induced by the preceding inner product, which does not converge to a ''continuous'' function.\n\n===Random variables===\n\nFor real [[random variable]]s {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}}, the [[expected value]] of their product\n:<math> \\langle X, Y \\rangle := \\operatorname{E}(X Y) </math>\nis an inner product.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ouwehand|first1=Peter|title=Spaces of Random Variables|url=http://users.aims.ac.za/~pouw/Lectures/Lecture_Spaces_Random_Variables.pdf|website=AIMS|accessdate=2017-09-05|date=November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Siegrist|first1=Kyle|title=Vector Spaces of Random Variables|url=http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/expect/Spaces.html|website=Random: Probability, Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Processes|accessdate=2017-09-05|date=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Bigoni|first1=Daniele|title=Uncertainty Quantification with Applications to Engineering Problems|date=2015|type=PhD |publisher=Technical University of Denmark|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/106969507/phd359_Bigoni_D.pdf|accessdate=2017-09-05|chapter=Appendix B: Probability theory and functional spaces}}</ref> In this case, {{math|{{angbr|''X'',''X''}} {{=}} 0}} if and only if {{math|[[probability|Pr]](''X'' {{=}} 0) {{=}} 1}} (i.e., {{math|''X'' {{=}} 0}} [[almost surely]]).

The norm is thought of as the length of the vector {{math|''x''}}. Directly from the axioms, we can prove the following:\n\n*[[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]]: for {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} elements of {{math|''V''}}\n\n::<math> |\\langle x,y\\rangle| \\leq \\|x\\| \\cdot \\|y\\| </math>\n\n:with equality if and only if {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are [[linearly independent|linearly dependent]]. This is one of the most important inequalities in mathematics. It is also known in the Russian mathematical literature as the ''Cauchy\u2013Bunyakovsky\u2013Schwarz inequality''.\n\n*[[Orthogonal]]ity: The geometric interpretation of the inner product in terms of angle and length, motivates much of the geometric terminology we use in regard to these spaces. Indeed, an immediate consequence of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality is that it justifies defining the [[angle]] between two non-zero vectors {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} (denoted {{math|\u2220}}) in the case {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''R'''}} by the identity\n\n::<math>\\angle(x,y) = \\arccos \\frac{\\langle x, y \\rangle}{\\|x\\| \\cdot \\|y\\|}.</math>\n\n:We assume the value of the angle is chosen to be in the interval {{closed-closed|0,\u2009\u03c0}}. This is in analogy to the situation in two-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].\n\n:In the case {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''C'''}}, the angle in the interval {{closed-closed|0,\u2009{{sfrac|\u03c0|2}}}} is typically defined by\n\n::<math>\\angle(x,y) = \\arccos \\frac{|\\langle x, y \\rangle|}{\\|x\\| \\cdot \\|y\\|}.</math>\n\n:Correspondingly, we will say that non-zero vectors {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} of {{math|''V''}} are orthogonal if and only if their inner product is zero.\n\n*[[homogeneous function|Homogeneity]]: for {{math|''x''}} an element of {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''r''}} a scalar\n\n::<math> \\|r \\cdot x\\| = |r| \\cdot \\| x\\|.</math>\n\n:The homogeneity property is completely trivial to prove.\n\n*[[Triangle inequality]]: for {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} elements of {{math|''V''}}\n\n::<math> \\|x + y\\| \\leq \\|x \\| + \\|y\\|. </math>\n\n:The last two properties show the function defined is indeed a norm.\n\n:Because of the triangle inequality and because of axiom 2, we see that {{math|{{norm|\u00b7}}}} is a norm which turns {{math|''V''}} into a [[normed vector space]] and hence also into a [[metric space]]. The most important inner product spaces are the ones which are [[completeness (topology)|complete]] with respect to this metric; they are called [[Hilbert space]]s. Every inner product {{math|''V''}} space is a [[Dense set|dense]] subspace of some Hilbert space. This Hilbert space is essentially uniquely determined by {{math|''V''}} and is constructed by completing {{math|''V''}}.\n\n*[[Pythagorean theorem]]: Whenever {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} are in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''y''}} {{=}} 0}}, then\n\n::<math> \\|x\\|^2 + \\|y\\|^2 = \\|x+y\\|^2. </math>\n\n:The proof of the identity requires only expressing the definition of norm in terms of the inner product and multiplying out, using the property of additivity of each component.\n\n:The name ''Pythagorean theorem'' arises from the geometric interpretation of this result as an analogue of the theorem in [[synthetic geometry]]. Note that the proof of the Pythagorean theorem in synthetic geometry is considerably more elaborate because of the paucity of underlying structure. In this sense, the synthetic Pythagorean theorem, if correctly demonstrated, is deeper than the version given above.\n\n:An [[mathematical induction|induction]] on the Pythagorean theorem yields:\n\n*If {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are [[orthogonal]] vectors, that is, {{math|{{angbr|''x<sub>j</sub>'',''x<sub>k</sub>''}} {{=}} 0}} for distinct indices {{math|''j''}}, {{math|''k''}}, then\n\n::<math> \\sum_{i=1}^n \\|x_i\\|^2 = \\left\\|\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\right\\|^2. </math>\n\n:In view of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we also note that {{math|{{angbr|\u00b7,\u00b7}}}} is [[continuous function|continuous]] from {{math|''V'' \u00d7 ''V''}} to {{math|''F''}}. This allows us to extend Pythagoras' theorem to infinitely many summands:\n\n*Parseval's identity: Suppose {{math|''V''}} is a ''complete'' inner product space.

Recall that every [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of {{math|''V''}} consists of exactly {{math|''n''}} linearly independent vectors. Using the [[Gram\u2013Schmidt process]] we may start with an arbitrary basis and transform it into an orthonormal basis. That is, into a basis in which all the elements are orthogonal and have unit norm. In symbols, a basis {{math|{''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e<sub>n</sub>''<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} is orthonormal if {{math|{{angbr|''e<sub>i</sub>'',''e<sub>j</sub>''}} {{=}} 0}} for every {{math|''i'' \u2260 ''j''}} and {{math|{{angbr|''e<sub>i</sub>'',''e<sub>i</sub>''}} {{=}} {{norm|''e<sub>i</sub>''}} {{=}} 1}} for each {{math|''i''}}.\n\nThis definition of orthonormal basis generalizes to the case of infinite-dimensional inner product spaces in the following way. Let {{math|''V''}} be any inner product space. Then a collection\n\n:<math>E= \\left \\{e_{\\alpha} \\right \\}_{\\alpha \\in A}</math>\n\nis a ''basis'' for {{math|''V''}} if the subspace of {{math|''V''}} generated by finite linear combinations of elements of {{math|''E''}} is dense in {{math|''V''}} (in the norm induced by the inner product). We say that {{math|''E''}} is an ''orthonormal basis'' for {{math|''V''}} if it is a basis and\n\n:<math>\\left \\langle e_{\\alpha}, e_{\\beta} \\right \\rangle=0</math>\n\nif {{math|''\u03b1'' \u2260 ''\u03b2''}} and {{math|{{angbr|''e<sub>\u03b1</sub>'',''e<sub>\u03b1</sub>''}} {{=}} {{norm|''e<sub>\u03b1</sub>''}} {{=}} 1}} for all {{math|''\u03b1'', ''\u03b2'' \u2208 ''A''}}.\n\nUsing an infinite-dimensional analog of the Gram-Schmidt process one may show:\n\n'''Theorem.''' Any [[separable space|separable]] inner product space {{math|''V''}} has an orthonormal basis.\n\nUsing the [[Hausdorff maximal principle]] and the fact that in a [[Hilbert space|complete inner product space]] orthogonal projection onto linear subspaces is well-defined, one may also show that\n\n'''Theorem.''' Any [[Hilbert space|complete inner product space]] {{math|''V''}} has an orthonormal basis.\n\nThe two previous theorems raise the question of whether all inner product spaces have an orthonormal basis. The answer, it turns out is negative. This is a non-trivial result, and is proved below. The following proof is taken from Halmos's ''A Hilbert Space Problem Book'' (see the references).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"90%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Proof\n|-\n| Recall that the dimension of an inner product space is the [[cardinality]] of a maximal orthonormal system that it contains (by [[Zorn's lemma]] it contains at least one, and any two have the same cardinality). An orthonormal basis is certainly a maximal orthonormal system, but as we shall see, the converse need not hold. Observe that if {{math|''G''}} is a dense subspace of an inner product space {{math|''H''}}, then any orthonormal basis for {{math|''G''}} is automatically an orthonormal basis for {{math|''H''}}. Thus, it suffices to construct an inner product space {{math|''H''}} with a dense subspace {{math|''G''}} whose dimension is strictly smaller than that of {{math|''H''}}.\n\nLet {{math|''K''}} be a [[Hilbert space]] of dimension {{math|[[Aleph-null|\u2135<sub>0</sub>]]}} (for instance, {{math|''K'' {{=}} ''l''{{isup|2}}('''N''')}}). Let {{math|''E''}} be an orthonormal basis of {{math|''K''}}, so {{math|{{abs|''E''}} {{=}} \u2135<sub>0</sub>}}. Extend {{math|''E''}} to a [[Basis (linear algebra)#Related notions|Hamel basis]] {{math|''E'' \u222a ''F''}} for {{math|''K''}}, where {{math|''E'' \u2229 ''F'' {{=}} \u2205}}. Since it is known that the [[Hamel dimension]] of {{math|''K''}} is {{math|''c''}}, the cardinality of the continuum, it must be that {{math|{{abs|''F''}} {{=}} ''c''}}.\n\nLet {{math|''L''}} be a Hilbert space of dimension {{math|''c''}} (for instance, {{math|''L'' {{=}} ''l''{{isup|2}}('''R''')}}). Let {{math|''B''}} be an orthonormal basis for {{math|''L''}}, and let {{math|''\u03c6'' : ''F'' \u2192 ''B''}} be a bijection. Then there is a linear transformation {{math|''T'' : ''K'' \u2192 ''L''}} such that {{math|''Tf'' {{=}} ''\u03c6''(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}} for {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''F''}}, and {{math|''Te'' {{=}} 0}} for {{math|''e'' \u2208 ''E''}}.\n\nLet {{math|''H'' {{=}} ''K'' \u2295 ''L''}} and let {{math|''G'' {{=}} {(''k'',''Tk'') : ''k'' \u2208 ''K'')<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} be the graph of {{math|''T''}}. Let {{math|''\u1e20''}} be the closure of {{math|''G''}} in {{math|''H''}}; we will show {{math|''\u1e20'' {{=}} H}}. Since for any {{math|''e'' \u2208 ''E''}} we have {{math|(''e'',''0'') \u2208 ''G''}}, it follows that {{math|''K'' \u2295 0 \u2282 ''\u1e20''}}.\n\nNext, if {{math|''b'' \u2208 ''B''}}, then {{math|''b'' {{=}} ''Tf''}} for some {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''F'' \u2282 ''K''}}, so {{math|(&thinsp;''f'',''b'') \u2208 ''G'' \u2282 ''\u1e20''}}; since {{math|(&thinsp;''f'',0) \u2208 ''\u1e20''}} as well, we also have {{math|(''0'',''b'') \u2208 ''\u1e20''}}. It follows that {{math|0 \u2295 ''L'' \u2282 ''\u1e20''}}, so {{math|''\u1e20'' {{=}} ''H''}}, and {{math|''G''}} is dense in {{math|''H''}}.\n\nFinally, {{math|{(''e'',0) : ''e'' \u2208 ''E''<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} is a maximal orthonormal set in {{math|''G''}}; if\n\n:<math>0 = \\langle (e,0), (k, Tk) \\rangle = \\langle e,k \\rangle + \\langle 0,Tk \\rangle = \\langle e,k \\rangle</math>\n\nfor all {{math|''e'' \u2208 ''E''}} then certainly {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}}, so {{math|(''k'',''Tk'') {{=}} (0,0)}} is the zero vector in {{math|''G''}}. Hence the dimension of {{math|''G''}} is {{math|{{abs|''E''}} {{=}} \u2135<sub>0</sub>}}, whereas it is clear that the dimension of {{math|''H''}} is {{math|''c''}}. This completes the proof.\n|}\n\n[[Parseval's identity]] leads immediately to the following theorem:\n\n'''Theorem.''' Let {{math|''V''}} be a separable inner product space and {{math|{''e''<sub>''k''</sub>}<sub>''k''</sub>}} an orthonormal basis of&nbsp;{{math|''V''}}. Then the map\n:<math> x \\mapsto \\bigl\\{\\langle e_k, x\\rangle\\bigr\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}} </math>\nis an isometric linear map {{math|''V'' \u2192 ''l''{{isup|2}}}} with a dense image.\n\nThis theorem can be regarded as an abstract form of [[Fourier series]], in which an arbitrary orthonormal basis plays the role of the sequence of [[trigonometric polynomial]]s. Note that the underlying index set can be taken to be any countable set (and in fact any set whatsoever, provided {{math|''l''{{isup|2}}}} is defined appropriately, as is explained in the article [[Hilbert space]]). In particular, we obtain the following result in the theory of Fourier series:\n\n'''Theorem.''' Let {{math|''V''}} be the inner product space {{math|''C''[\u2212\u03c0,\u03c0]}}. Then the sequence (indexed on set of all integers) of continuous functions\n\n:<math>e_k(t) = \\frac{e^{i k t}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}</math>\n\nis an orthonormal basis of the space {{math|''C''[\u2212\u03c0,\u03c0]}} with the {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} inner product. The mapping\n\n:<math> f \\mapsto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\left\\{\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi f(t) e^{-i k t} \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} </math>\n\nis an isometric linear map with dense image.\n\nOrthogonality of the sequence {{math|{''e<sub>k</sub>''}<sub>''k''</sub>}} follows immediately from the fact that if {{math|''k'' \u2260 ''j''}}, then\n\n:<math> \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi e^{-i (j-k) t} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = 0. </math>\n\nNormality of the sequence is by design, that is, the coefficients are so chosen so that the norm comes out to 1. Finally the fact that the sequence has a dense algebraic span, in the ''inner product norm'', follows from the fact that the sequence has a dense algebraic span, this time in the space of continuous periodic functions on {{math|[\u2212\u03c0,\u03c0]}} with the uniform norm. This is the content of the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem|Weierstrass theorem]] on the uniform density of trigonometric polynomials.\n\n==Operators on inner product spaces==\nSeveral types of [[linear]] maps {{math|''A''}} from an inner product space {{math|''V''}} to an inner product space {{math|''W''}} are of relevance:\n* [[Continuous linear operator|Continuous linear maps]], i.e., {{math|''A''}} is linear and continuous with respect to the metric defined above, or equivalently, {{math|''A''}} is linear and the set of non-negative reals {{math|{{{norm|''Ax''}}<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}, where {{math|''x''}} ranges over the closed unit ball of {{math|''V''}}, is bounded.\n* Symmetric linear operators, i.e., {{math|''A''}} is linear and {{math|{{angbr|''Ax'',''y''}} {{=}} {{angbr|''x'',''Ay''}}}} for all {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} in {{math|''V''}}.\n* Isometries, i.e., {{math|''A''}} is linear and {{math|{{angbr|''Ax'',''Ay''}} {{=}} {{angbr|''x'',''y''}}}} for all {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} in {{math|''V''}}, or equivalently, {{math|''A''}} is linear and {{math|{{norm|''Ax''}} {{=}} {{norm|''x''}}}} for all {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''V''}}. All isometries are [[injective]]. Isometries are [[morphism]]s between inner product spaces, and morphisms of real inner product spaces are orthogonal transformations (compare with [[orthogonal matrix]]).\n* Isometrical isomorphisms, i.e., {{math|''A''}} is an isometry which is [[surjective]] (and hence [[bijective]]). Isometrical isomorphisms are also known as unitary operators (compare with [[unitary matrix]]).\n\nFrom the point of view of inner product space theory, there is no need to distinguish between two spaces which are isometrically isomorphic. The [[spectral theorem]] provides a canonical form for symmetric, unitary and more generally [[normal operator]]s on finite dimensional inner product spaces. A generalization of the spectral theorem holds for continuous normal operators in Hilbert spaces.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nAny of the axioms of an inner product may be weakened, yielding generalized notions. The generalizations that are closest to inner products occur where bilinearity and conjugate symmetry are retained, but positive-definiteness is weakened.\n\n=== Degenerate inner products ===\nIf {{math|''V''}} is a vector space and {{math|{{angbr|\u00b7,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7}}}} a semi-definite sesquilinear form, then the function:\n\n:<math> \\|x\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle x, x\\rangle}</math>\n\nmakes sense and satisfies all the properties of norm except that {{math|{{norm|''x''}} {{=}} 0}} does not imply {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} (such a functional is then called a [[semi-norm]]). We can produce an inner product space by considering the quotient {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''V''/{''x'' : {{norm|''x''}} {{=}} 0}}}. The sesquilinear form {{math|{{angbr|\u00b7,\u00b7}}}} factors through {{math|''W''}}.\n\nThis construction is used in numerous contexts. The [[Gelfand\u2013Naimark\u2013Segal construction]] is a particularly important example of the use of this technique. Another example is the representation of [[Mercer's theorem|semi-definite kernel]]s on arbitrary sets.\n\n=== Nondegenerate conjugate symmetric forms ===\n{{Main|Pseudo-Euclidean space}}\nAlternatively, one may require that the pairing be a [[nondegenerate form]], meaning that for all non-zero {{math|''x''}} there exists some {{math|''y''}} such that {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''y''}} \u2260 0}}, though {{math|''y''}} need not equal {{math|''x''}}; in other words, the induced map to the dual space {{math|''V'' \u2192 ''V''{{isup|\u2217}}}} is injective. This generalization is important in [[differential geometry]]: a manifold whose tangent spaces have an inner product is a [[Riemannian manifold]], while if this is related to nondegenerate conjugate symmetric form the manifold is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. By [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], just as every inner product is similar to the dot product with positive weights on a set of vectors, every nondegenerate conjugate symmetric form is similar to the dot product with ''nonzero'' weights on a set of vectors, and the number of positive and negative weights are called respectively the positive index and negative index. Product of vectors in [[Minkowski space]] is an example of indefinite inner product, although, technically speaking, it is not an inner product according to the standard definition above. Minkowski space has four [[dimension (mathematics)|dimensions]] and indices 3 and 1 (assignment of [[sign (mathematics)|\"+\" and \"\u2212\"]] to them [[sign convention#Metric signature|differs depending on conventions]]).\n\nPurely algebraic statements (ones that do not use positivity) usually only rely on the nondegeneracy (the injective homomorphism {{math|''V'' \u2192 ''V''{{isup|\u2217}}}}) and thus hold more generally.\n\n==Related products==\nThe term \"inner product\" is opposed to [[outer product]], which is a slightly more general opposite. Simply, in coordinates, the inner product is the product of a {{math|1 \u00d7 ''n''}} ''covector'' with an {{math|''n'' \u00d7 1}} vector, yielding a 1&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;1 matrix (a scalar), while the outer product is the product of an {{math|''m'' \u00d7 1}} vector with a {{math|1 \u00d7 ''n''}} covector, yielding an {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix. Note that the outer product is defined for different dimensions, while the inner product requires the same dimension. If the dimensions are the same, then the inner product is the ''trace'' of the outer product (trace only being properly defined for square matrices).  In a quip: \"inner is horizontal times vertical and shrinks down, outer is vertical times horizontal and expands out\".\n\nMore abstractly, the outer product is the bilinear map {{math|''W'' \u00d7 ''V''{{isup|\u2217}} \u2192 Hom(''V'',''W'')}} sending a vector and a covector to a rank 1 linear transformation ([[simple tensor]] of type (1,1)), while the inner product is the bilinear evaluation map {{math|''V''{{isup|\u2217}} \u00d7 ''V'' \u2192 ''F''}} given by evaluating a covector on a vector; the order of the domain vector spaces here reflects the covector/vector distinction.\n\nThe inner product and outer product should not be confused with the [[interior product]] and [[exterior product]], which are instead operations on [[vector field]]s and [[differential form]]s, or more generally on the [[exterior algebra]].\n\nAs a further complication, in [[geometric algebra]] the inner product and the ''exterior'' (Grassmann) product are combined in the geometric product (the Clifford product in a [[Clifford algebra]]) \u2013 the inner product sends two vectors (1-vectors) to a scalar (a 0-vector), while the exterior product sends two vectors to a bivector (2-vector) \u2013 and in this context the exterior product is usually called the \"''outer'' (alternatively, wedge) product\". The inner product is more correctly called a ''scalar'' product in this context, as the nondegenerate quadratic form in question need not be positive definite (need not be an inner product).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Space (mathematics)]]\n* [[Normed vector space]]\n* [[Energetic space]]\n* [[Dual space]]\n* [[Biorthogonal system]]\n* [[Bilinear form]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{Cite book | last1=Axler | first1=Sheldon | title=Linear Algebra Done Right | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-387-98258-8 | year=1997 | postscript=<!--None-->}}\n* {{Cite book | last1=Emch | first1=Gerard G. | title=Algebraic Methods in Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory | publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]] | isbn=978-0-471-23900-0 | year=1972 | postscript=<!--None-->}}\n* {{Cite book | last1=Young | first1=Nicholas | title=An Introduction to Hilbert Space | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-33717-5 | year=1988 | postscript=<!--None-->}}\n\n<!-- AWB bots, please leave this space alone. -->\n\n{{linear algebra}}\n{{Functional analysis}}\n\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n[[Category:Normed spaces]]\n[[Category:Bilinear forms]]", "sha1": "d9qnoudhli6vlrejvzen2we8fxpsl7r"}}, {"title": "Iain M.

John Harrison]] and [[Dan Simmons]] as literary influences.<ref name=\"CNN\"/>  ''[[The Crow Road]]'', published in 1992, was adapted as a BBC television series.<ref name=\"Spike\"/> Banks continued to write both science fiction and mainstream novels, with his final novel [[The Quarry (Iain Banks novel)|''The Quarry'']] published in June 2013, the month of his death.\n\nBanks published work under two names. His parents had intended to name him \"Iain Menzies Banks\", but his father made a mistake when registering the birth and \"Iain Banks\" became the officially registered name. Despite this error, Banks used the middle name and submitted ''The Wasp Factory'' for publication as \"Iain M. Banks\". Banks's editor inquired about the possibility of omitting the 'M' as it appeared \"too fussy\" and the potential existed for confusion with [[Rosie M. Banks]], a romantic novelist in the [[Jeeves]] novels by [[P.G. Wodehouse]]; Banks agreed to the omission. After three mainstream novels, Banks's publishers agreed to publish his first science fiction (SF) novel ''Consider Phlebas''. To create a distinction between the mainstream and SF novels, Banks suggested the return of the 'M' to his name, and it was used in all of his science fiction works.<ref name=\"Five\"/><ref name=\"Lawson\"/>\n[[File:Ian M.

I think a lot of people have assumed that the SF was the trashy but high-selling stuff I had to churn out in order to keep a roof over my head while I wrote the important, serious, non-genre literary novels. Never been the case, and I can't imagine that I'd have lied about this sort of thing, least of all as some sort of joke. The SF novels have always mattered deeply to me \u2013 the Culture series in particular \u2013 and while it might not be what people want to hear (academics especially), the mainstream subsidised the SF, not the other way round.}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2012 Banks was revealed as one of the Guests of Honour at the 2014 World Science Fiction Convention, [[Loncon 3]].\n\n===Radio and television===\nBanks was the subject of ''The Strange Worlds of Iain Banks'' ''[[The South Bank Show|South Bank Show]]'' (1997), a television documentary that examined his mainstream writing, and was also an in-studio guest for the final episode of [[Marc Riley]]'s ''Rocket Science'' radio show, broadcast on [[BBC Radio 6 Music]].<ref name=\"Simon\"/>\n\nAn audio version of ''The Business'', set to contemporary music, arranged by [[Paul Oakenfold]], was broadcast in October 1999 on Galaxy Fm as the tenth [[Urban Soundtracks]]. \n\nA radio adaptation of Banks's ''The State of the Art'' was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2009; the adaptation was written by [[Paul Cornell]] and the production was directed/produced by Nadia Molinari.<ref name=\"The State of the Art\"/><ref name=\"The State of the Art at Radio 4\"/> In 1998 ''Espedair Street'' was dramatised as a serial for Radio 4, presented by [[Paul Gambaccini]] in the style of a Radio 1 documentary.\n\nIn 2011 Banks was featured on the BBC Radio 4 programme ''Saturday Live''. Banks reaffirmed his atheism during his ''Saturday Live'' appearance, whereby he explained that death is an important \"part of the totality of life\" and should be treated realistically, instead of feared.<ref name=\"bbc\"/><ref name=\"atheism\"/>\n\nBanks appeared on the BBC television programme ''[[Question Time (television)|Question Time]]'', a show that features political discussion. In 2006 Banks captained a team of writers to victory in a special series of [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[University Challenge: The Professionals|University Challenge]]''. Banks also won a 2006 edition of [[BBC One]]'s ''[[Mastermind (television)|Celebrity Mastermind]]''; the author selected \"Malt whisky and the distilleries of Scotland\" as his specialist subject.<ref name=\"Simon\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries2007\" />\n\nHis final interview was with [[Kirsty Wark]] and was broadcast as ''Iain Banks: Raw Spirit'' on BBC2 Scotland on Wednesday 12 June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02xf70k|title=Iain Banks: Raw Spirit - BBC Two|website=BBC}}</ref>\n\nBBC One Scotland and BBC2 broadcast an adaptation of his novel [[Stonemouth]] in June 2015.\n\n===Theatre===\nBanks was involved in the theatre production ''The Curse of Iain Banks'' that was written by Maxton Walker<ref name=\"Theatre: The Curse of Iain Banks, Gilded Balloon\"/> and was performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] festival in 1999.  Banks collaborated with the play's soundtrack composer [[Gary Lloyd]] frequently, including on a collection of songs they co-composed in tribute to the fictional band 'Frozen Gold' from Banks's novel 'Espedair Street'.  Lloyd also composed the score for a spoken word and musical production of the Banks novel ''The Bridge''<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/> which Banks himself voiced and featured a cast of forty musicians (released on cd by Codex Records in 1996).  Lloyd recorded Banks for inclusion in the play as a disembodied voice appearing as himself in one of the cast member's dreams.  Lloyd explained his collaboration with Banks on their first versions of 'Espedair Street' (subsequent versions are dated from between 2005 and 2013) in a ''Guardian'' article prior to the opening of ''The Curse of Iain Banks'':\n\n<blockquote>\nWhen he [Banks] first played them to me, I think he was worried that they might not be up to scratch (some of them dated back to 1973 and had never been heard). He needn't have worried. They're fantastic. We're slaving away to get the songs to the stage where we can go into the studio and make a demo. Iain bashes out melodies on his state-of-the-art Apple Mac in Edinburgh and sends them down to me in Chester where I put them onto my Atari.<ref name=\"Lloyd\" />\n</blockquote>\n\n==Politics==\nBanks's political position has been described as \"left of centre\",<ref name=\"economist\"/> and he was an Honorary Associate of the [[National Secular Society]] and a Distinguished Supporter of the [[Humanist Society  Scotland]]. As a signatory to the [[Declaration of Calton Hill]],<ref name=\"archive\"/> he was an open supporter of [[Scottish independence]].<ref name=\"guardian\"/> In November 2012, Banks supported the campaign group that emerged from the Radical Independence Conference that was held during that month. Banks explained that the Scottish independence movement was motivated by co-operation and \"just seem to be more [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] than the consensus expressed by the UK population as a whole\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Radicals threaten Salmond and Scottish independence campaign|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/radicals-threaten-salmond-and-scottish-independence-campaign-8347545.html|accessdate=25 February 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=24 November 2012|author=Hamish Macdonell}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2004, Banks was a member of a group of British politicians and media figures who campaigned to have Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] impeached following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. In protest he cut up his passport and posted it to [[10 Downing Street]]\u2014in a ''[[Socialist Review]]'' interview, Banks explained that his passport protest occurred after he \"abandoned the idea of crashing my Land Rover through the gates of Fife dockyard, after spotting the guys armed with machine guns.\"<ref name=\"Jeffries2007\"/><ref name=\"socrev\"/> Banks relayed his concerns about the invasion of Iraq in his book ''[[Raw Spirit]]'', and the principal protagonist (Alban McGill) in the novel ''[[The Steep Approach to Garbadale]]'' confronts another character with arguments of a similar nature.<ref name=\"Jeffries2007\"/><ref name=socrev/>\n\nIn 2010 Banks called for a cultural and educational boycott of Israel after the [[Gaza flotilla raid]] incident. In a letter to ''The Guardian'' newspaper, Banks stated that he had instructed his agent to turn down any further book translation deals with Israeli publishers:\n\n<blockquote>\nAppeals to reason, international law, U.N. resolutions and simple human decency mean{{mdash}}it is now obvious{{mdash}}nothing to Israel&nbsp;... I would urge all writers, artists and others in the creative arts, as well as those academics engaging in joint educational projects with Israeli institutions, to consider doing everything they can to convince Israel of its moral degradation and ethical isolation, preferably by simply having nothing more to do with this outlaw state.<ref name=\"Letters: Small step towards a boycott of Israel\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAn extract from Banks's contribution to the written collection ''Generation Palestine: Voices from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement'', entitled \"Our People\", was published in ''The Guardian'' in the wake of the author's cancer revelation. The extract relays the author's support for the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)]] campaign that was issued by a Palestinian civil society against Israel until the country complies with what they hold are international law and Palestinian rights, that commenced in 2005 and applies the lessons from Banks's experience with South Africa's [[apartheid]] era. The continuation of Banks's boycott of Israeli publishers for the sale of the rights to his novels was also confirmed in the extract and Banks further explained, \"I don't buy Israeli-sourced products or food, and my partner and I try to support Palestinian-sourced products wherever possible.\"<ref name=\"Iain Banks: why I'm supporting a cultural boycott of Israel\"/>\n\nIn 2002, Banks endorsed the [[Scottish Socialist Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scottishsocialistparty.org/iain-banks-the-ssp-gets-my-vote-and-i-buy-the-scottish-socialist-voice/|title=Iain Banks: 'The SSP gets my vote....' \u00bb Scottish Socialist Party|date=10 June 2013|website=scottishsocialistparty.org}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBanks met his first wife, Annie, in London before the 1984 release of his first book.<ref name=\"Jeffries2007\" /> The couple lived in [[Faversham]] in the south of England, then split up in 1988.

It is a more elegant replacement for what had previously been called 'fifteeners', and is formed of two Latin words meaning literally 'in the cradle' or 'in swaddling clothes'. The word is plural; in referring to a single fifteenth century book, \"incunabulum\" is correct.}}</ref><ref>\"Fifteener\" is a coinage of the bibliographer [[Thomas Frognall Dibdin]], a term endorsed by [[William Morris]] and [[Robert Proctor (bibliographer)|Robert Proctor]]. {{harv|Carter|Barker|2004|p=130}}.</ref>\n\nThe term ''incunabula'' as a printing term was first used by the Dutch physician and humanist [[Hadrianus Junius|Hadrianus Iunius]] (Adriaan de Jonghe, 1511\u20131575) and appears in a passage from his posthumous work (written in 1569): Hadrianus Iunius, ''Batavia'', [...], [Lugduni Batavorum], ex officina Plantiniana, apud Franciscum Raphelengium, '''1588''', p. 256 l. 3: \u00abinter prima artis [typographicae] '''incunabula'''\u00bb, a term (\"the first infancy of printing\") to which he arbitrarily set an end of 1500 which still stands as a convention.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Glomski|first1=J|title=Incunabula Typographiae: seventeenth-century views on early printing|journal=The Library|volume=2|pages=336|year=2001|doi=10.1093/library/2.4.336}}</ref>\n\nOnly by a misunderstanding was [[Bernhard von Mallinckrodt]] (1591\u20131664) considered to be the inventor of this meaning of ''incunabula''; the identical passage is found in his Latin pamphlet ''De ortu ac progressu artis typographicae'' (\"On the rise and progress of the typographic art\", [[Cologne]], 1640): Bernardus a Mallinkrot, ''De ortu ac progressu artis typographicae dissertatio historica'', [...], Coloniae Agrippinae, apud Ioannem Kinchium, '''1640''' (in frontispiece: 1639), p. 29 l. 16: \u00abinter prima artis [typographicae] '''incunabula'''\u00bb, within a long passage of several pages, which he (correctly) quotes entirely in italic characters (that is between quotation marks), referring to the name of author and work cited: \u00abPrimus istorum [...] Hadrianus Iunius est, cuius integrum locum, ex ''Batavia'' eius, operae pretium est adscribere; [...].

[[John Evelyn]], in moving the [[Arundel Manuscripts]] to the [[Royal Society]] in August 1678, remarked of the printed books among the manuscripts: \"The printed books, being of the oldest impressions, are not the less valuable; I esteem them almost equal to MSS.\"<ref>Evelyn, ''The Diary of John Evelyn From 1641 to 1705/6''.</ref> The convenient but arbitrarily chosen end date for identifying a printed book as an incunable does not reflect any notable developments in the printing process, and many books printed for a number of years after 1500 continued to be visually indistinguishable from incunables.  \n\n'''\"Post-incunable\"''' typically refers to books printed after 1500 up to another arbitrary end date such as 1520 or 1540. From around this period the dating of any edition becomes easier, as the practice of printers including information such as the place and year of printing became more widespread.\n\n==Types==\nThere are two types of ''incunabula'' in printing: the [[block book]], printed from a single carved or sculpted wooden block for each page, employing the same process as the [[woodcut]] in art (these may be called ''xylographic''); and the ''[[Typography|typographic book]]'', made with individual pieces of cast-metal [[movable type]] on a [[printing press]]. Many authors reserve the term ''incunabula'' for the latter kind only.<ref>''Oxford Companion to the Book'', ed. M. F. Suarez and H. R. Woudhuysen, OUP, 2010, s.v. 'Incunabulum', p. 815.</ref>\n\nThe spread of [[printing]] to cities both in the north and in Italy ensured that there was great variety in the texts chosen for printing and the styles in which they appeared. Many early [[typeface]]s were modelled on local forms of [[writing]] or derived from the various European forms of [[Blackletter|Gothic]] script, but there were also some derived from documentary scripts (such as most of [[William Caxton|Caxton]]'s types), and, particularly in Italy, types modelled on handwritten scripts and [[calligraphy]] employed by [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]].\n\nPrinters congregated in urban centres where there were [[scholar]]s, [[ecclesiastic]]s, [[lawyers]], and [[nobles]] and [[profession]]als who formed their major customer base. Standard works in [[Latin]] inherited from the medieval tradition formed the bulk of the earliest printed works, but as books became cheaper, [[vernacular]] works (or translations into vernaculars of standard works) began to appear.\n\n==Famous examples==\n[[File:Pfister.faks.1.jpg|thumb|left|240px|First incunable with illustrations, Ulrich Boner's ''Der Edelstein,'' printed by Albrecht Pfister, Bamberg, 1461]]\nThe most famous ''incunabula'' include two from [[Mainz]], the [[Gutenberg Bible]] of 1455 and the ''[[Peregrinatio in terram sanctam]]'' of 1486, printed and illustrated by [[Erhard Reuwich]]; the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' written by [[Hartmann Schedel]] and printed by [[Anton Koberger]] in 1493; and the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' printed by [[Aldus Manutius]] with important illustrations by an unknown artist. \n\nOther printers of incunabula were [[G\u00fcnther Zainer]] of [[Augsburg]], [[Johannes Mentelin]] and [[Heinrich Eggestein]] of [[Strasbourg]], [[Heinrich Gran]] of [[Haguenau]] and [[William Caxton]] of [[Bruges]] and [[London]]. The first incunable to have woodcut illustrations was [[Ulrich Boner]]'s ''Der Edelstein'', printed by [[Albrecht Pfister]] in [[Bamberg]] in 1461.<ref>Daniel De Simone (ed), ''A Heavenly Craft: the Woodcut in Early Printed Books,'' New York, 2004, p. 48.</ref>\n\n== Post-incunable ==\nMany incunabula are undated, needing complex bibliographical analysis to place them correctly. The post-incunabula period marks a time of development during which the printed book evolved fully as a mature artefact with a standard format.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |title=The Book Triumphant: Print in Transition in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries |editor1-last=Walsby |editor1-first=Malcolm |editor2-last=Kemp |editor2-first=Graeme |publisher=Brill |year=2011 |page=viii |isbn=9789004207233 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cysqnfvAUEAC&pg=PR7}}</ref> After c. 1540 books tended to conform to a template that included the author, title-page, date, seller, and place of printing. This makes it much easier to identify any particular edition.{{sfn|Walsby|Kemp|2011|p=viii}}\n\nAs noted above, the ''end date'' for identifying a printed book as an incunable is convenient but was chosen arbitrarily; it does not reflect any notable developments in the printing process around the year 1500. Books printed for a number of years after 1500 continued to look much like incunables, with the notable exception of the small format books printed in [[italic type]] introduced by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1501. The term '''post-incunable''' is sometimes used to refer to books printed \"after 1500\u2014how long after, the experts have not yet agreed.\"<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv| |first=John |last=Carter |first2=Nicolas |last2=Barker |title=ABC for Book Collectors |url=http://www.ilab.org/download.php?object=documentation&id=29 |format=PDF |accessdate=28 May 2010 |edition=8th |year=2004 |publisher=Oak Knoll Press and the British Library |location=New Castle, Del. |isbn=1-58456-112-2 |page=172}} {{free access}}</ref> For books printed in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the term generally covers 1501\u20131520, and for books printed in mainland [[Europe]], 1501\u20131540.{{sfn|Carter|Barker|2004|p=172}}\n\n== Statistical data ==\n[[File:Printing towns incunabula.svg|thumb|Printing towns]]\n[[File:Incunabula distribution by region.png|thumb|Distribution by region]]\n[[File:Incunabula distribution by language.png|thumb|Distribution by language]]\nThe data in this section were derived from the [[Incunabula Short-Title Catalogue]] (ISTC).<ref>[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html BL.uk], consulted in 2007.

Many incunabula are unique, but on average about 18 copies survive of each. This makes the [[Gutenberg Bible]], at 48 or 49 known copies, a relatively common (though extremely valuable) edition. Counting extant incunabula is complicated by the fact that most libraries consider a single volume of a multi-volume work as a separate item, as well as fragments or copies lacking more than half the total leaves. A complete incunable may consist of a slip, or up to ten volumes.\n\nIn terms of [[Book size|format]], the 29,000-odd editions comprise: 2,000 [[broadside (printing)|broadsides]], 9,000 [[Folio (printing)|folios]], 15,000 [[quarto]]s, 3,000 [[octavo]]s, 18 [[Book size|12mos]], 230 [[Book size|16mos]], 20 [[Book size|32mos]], and 3 [[Book size|64mos]].\n\nISTC at present cites 528 extant copies of books printed by [[William Caxton|Caxton]], which together with 128 fragments makes 656 in total, though many are broadsides or very imperfect (incomplete).\n\nApart from migration to mainly North American and Japanese universities, there has been little movement of incunabula in the last five centuries. None were printed in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the latter appears to possess less than 2,000 copies, about 97.75% remain north of the equator. However many incunabula are sold at auction or through the rare book trade every year.\n\n==Major collections==\nThe [[British Library]]'s [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]] now records over 29,000 titles, of which around 27,400 are incunabula editions (not all unique works). Studies of incunabula began in the 17th century. [[Michel Maittaire]] (1667\u20131747) and [[Georg Wolfgang Panzer]] (1729\u20131805) arranged printed material chronologically in annals format, and in the first half of the 19th century, [[Ludwig Hain]] published, ''Repertorium bibliographicum''\u2014 a checklist of incunabula arranged alphabetically by author: \"Hain numbers\" are still a reference point. Hain was expanded in subsequent editions, by [[Walter A. Copinger]] and [[Dietrich Reichling]], but it is being superseded by the authoritative modern listing, a German catalogue, the ''[[Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke]]'', which has been under way since 1925 and is still being compiled at the [[Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin]]. North American holdings were listed by [[Frederick R. Goff]] and a worldwide union catalogue is provided by the [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/|title=ISTC|accessdate=2009-05-16}}</ref>\n\nNotable collections, with the approximate numbers of incunabula held, include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left; margin:1px; border:1px solid #cccccc; \"\n|----- align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" bgcolor=\"cccccc\"\n!

Precise definitions depend on the subject area.  Exceptions, or inequalities, are frequently indicated by the prefix ''an'', hence ''[[anisotropy]]''. ''Anisotropy'' is also used to describe situations where properties vary systematically, dependent on direction. [[Isotropic radiation]] has the same intensity regardless of the direction of [[measurement]], and an isotropic field exerts the same action regardless of how the test [[Elementary particle|particle]] is oriented.\n\n==Mathematics==\nWithin [[mathematics]], ''isotropy'' has a few different meanings:\n; [[Isotropic manifold]]s: A [[manifold]] is isotropic if the [[geometry]] on the manifold is the same regardless of direction. A similar concept is [[homogeneous space|homogeneity]]. \n; [[Isotropic quadratic form]]: A [[quadratic form]] ''q'' is said to be isotropic if there is a non-zero vector ''v'' such that {{nowrap|1=''q''(''v'') = 0}}; such a ''v'' is an [[isotropic vector]] or null vector. In complex geometry, a line through the origin in the direction of an isotropic vector is an [[isotropic line]].\n; [[Isotropic coordinates]]: Isotropic coordinates are coordinates on an isotropic chart for [[Lorentzian manifolds]].\n; [[Isotropy group]]: An isotropy group is the group of [[isomorphism]]s from any [[object (category theory)|object]] to itself in a [[groupoid]].<ref>A [[groupoid]] <math>\\mathcal G</math> is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] where all [[morphism]]s are [[isomorphism]]s, i.e., invertible. If <math>G \\in \\mathcal G</math> is any object, then <math>\\mathcal G(G,G)</math> denotes its [[isotropy group]]: the group of isomorphisms from <math>G</math> to <math>G</math>.</ref>\n; [[Isotropic position]]: A [[probability distribution]] over a [[vector space]] is in isotropic position if its [[covariance matrix]] is the [[identity matrix|identity]].\n\n==Physics==\n; [[Quantum mechanics]] or [[particle physics]]: When a spinless particle (or even an unpolarized particle with spin) decays, the resulting decay distribution ''must'' be isotropic in the rest frame of the decaying particle regardless of the detailed physics of the decay. This follows from [[rotational invariance]] of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]], which in turn is guaranteed for a spherically symmetric potential.\n:[[Kinetic theory of gases]] is also an example of isotropy. It is assumed that the molecules move in random directions and as a consequence, there is an equal probability of a molecule moving in any direction. Thus when there are many molecules in the gas, with high probability there will be very similar numbers moving in one direction as any other hence demonstrating approximate isotropy.\n\n; [[Fluid dynamics]]: Fluid flow is isotropic if there is no directional preference (e.g. in fully developed 3D turbulence). An example of anisotropy is in flows with a background density as gravity works in only one direction.  The apparent surface separating two differing isotropic fluids would be referred to as an isotrope.\n\n; [[Thermal expansion]]: A solid is said to be isotropic if the expansion of solid is equal in all directions when thermal energy is provided to the solid.\n\n; [[Electromagnetism|Electromagnetics]]: An isotropic medium is one such that the permittivity, \u03b5, and permeability, \u03bc, of the medium are uniform in all directions of the medium, the simplest instance being free space.\n\n; [[Optics]]: Optical isotropy means having the same optical properties in all directions. The individual [[reflectance]] or [[transmittance]] of the domains is averaged if the macroscopic reflectance or transmittance is to be calculated. This can be verified simply by investigating, e.g., a [[polycrystalline]] material under a polarizing microscope having the polarizers crossed: If the crystallites are larger than the resolution limit, they will be visible.\n<div id=\"Cosmology\"></div>\n; [[Cosmology]]: The [[Big Bang]] theory of the evolution of the observable universe assumes that space is isotropic.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_theory.html |title=WMAP Big Bang Theory |publisher=Map.gsfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-06}}</ref> It also assumes that space is homogeneous.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> These two assumptions together are known as the [[Cosmological Principle]]. As of 2006, the observations suggest that, on distance scales much larger than galaxies, galaxy clusters are [[Great Wall (astronomy)|\"Great\"]] features, but small compared to so-called [[multi-verse]] scenarios. Here homogeneous means that the universe is the same everywhere (no preferred origin) and isotropic implies that there is no preferred direction.\n\n===Materials science===\n[[Image:LvMS-Lvv.jpg|thumb|This sand grain made of [[volcanic]] glass is [[isotropic]], and thus, stays extinct when rotated between [[Polarizing filter (photography)|polarization filters]] on a [[petrographic microscope]]]]\nIn the study of [[List of materials properties|mechanical properties of materials]], \"isotropic\" means having identical values of a property in all directions.  This definition is also used in [[geology]] and [[mineralogy]]. Glass and metals are examples of isotropic materials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anisotropy and Isotropy|url=http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Materials/Structure/anisotropy.htm}}</ref>  Common anisotropic materials include [[wood]], because its material properties are different parallel and perpendicular to the grain, and layered rocks such as [[slate]].\n\nIsotropic materials are useful since they are easier to shape, and their behavior is easier to predict. Anisotropic materials can be tailored to the forces an object is expected to experience. For example, the fibers in [[carbon fiber]] materials and [[rebar]]s in [[reinforced concrete]] are oriented to withstand tension.\n\n===Microfabrication===\nIn industrial processes, such as etching steps, isotropic means that the process proceeds at the same rate, regardless of direction. Simple chemical reaction and removal of a substrate by an acid, a solvent or a reactive gas is often very close to isotropic. Conversely, anisotropic means that the attack rate of the substrate is higher in a certain direction. Anisotropic etch processes, where vertical etch-rate is high, but lateral etch-rate is very small are essential processes in [[microfabrication]] of [[integrated circuits]] and [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] devices.\n\n===Antenna (radio)===\nAn [[isotropic antenna]] is an idealized \"[[radiator|radiating element]]\" used as a [[reference]]; an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] that broadcasts power equally (calculated by the [[Poynting vector]]) in all directions. The [[Antenna gain|gain]] of an arbitrary antenna is usually reported in [[decibel]]s relative to an isotropic antenna, and is expressed as dBi or dB(i).\n\n==Biology==\n; [[Cell biology]]: If the properties of the [[Cell (biology)|cell wall]] are more or less the same everywhere, it is said to be isotropic. The interior of the cell is anisotropic due to intracellular [[organelle]]s.\n\n; [[Physiology]]: In skeletal muscle cells (a.k.a. [[muscle fibers]]), the term \"[[isotropic bands|isotropic]]\" refers to the light bands ([[I bands]]) that contribute to the striated pattern of the cells.\n\n; [[Pharmacology]]: While it is well established that the skin provides an ideal site for the administration of local and systemic drugs, it presents a formidable barrier to the permeation of most substances.<ref>Landman L. \u201cThe Epidermal Permeability Barrier.\u201d Anat Embryol (Berl) 1988; 178:1-13 [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x2v22259r84n6k75/]</ref> Most recently, [[isotropic formulations]] have been used extensively in dermatology for drug delivery.<ref>Gregoriadis G. \u201cLipsomes in Drug Delivery.\u201d Harwood Academic Publishers, 1993; [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=IqqYFne6deEC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=Liposomes+in+Drug+Delivery&ots=MSjlK_DRqc&sig=XKlC_NXQDndHXkVUepu8rIPaQrU]</ref>\n\n==Other sciences==\n; [[Economics]] and [[geography]]: An isotropic region is a region that has the same properties everywhere. Such a region is a construction needed in many types of models.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [[Rotational invariance]]\n* [[Isotropic bands]]\n* [[Isotropic coordinates]]\n* [[Transverse isotropy]]\n* [[Anisotropic]]\n* [[Bi isotropic]]\n* [[Symmetry]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Orientation (geometry)]]", "sha1": "bs7rz58wbtk1fjoyf387qia979iz2ox"}}, {"title": "International Mathematical Union", "ns": "0", "id": "14868", "revision": {"id": "863449841", "parentid": "859851982", "timestamp": "2018-10-10T20:51:15Z", "contributor": {"username": "Rathfelder", "id": "398607"}, "comment": "removed [[Category:Organisations based in Berlin]]; added [[Category:Non-profit organisations based in Berlin]] using [[WP:HC|HotCat]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox organization\n|name         = International Mathematical Union\n|image        = IMU-Logo.jpg\n|image_border = \n|size         = \n|alt          = \n|caption      = IMU logo based on the [[Borromean ring]]s \n|status       = unincorporated association, recognized as a charitable organization by the internal revenue service of Berlin, Germany\n|purpose      = Promoting International Cooperation in Mathematics\n|location     = IMU Secretariat, Markgrafenstr.32, D-10117 [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]\n|leader_title = President\n|leader_name  = [[Shigefumi Mori]]\n|main_organ   = \n|parent_organization = [[International Council for Science]]\n|website      = [http://www.mathunion.org/ mathunion.org]\n|remarks      =\n}}\nThe '''International Mathematical Union''' ('''IMU''') is an international [[non-governmental organization]] devoted to international cooperation in the field of [[mathematics]] across the world. It is a member of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) and supports the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]. Its members are national mathematics organizations from more than 80 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mathunion.org/membership/imu-members|title=International Mathematical Union (IMU): sorted by names|first=}}</ref>\n\nThe objectives of the International Mathematical Union (IMU) are: promoting international cooperation in mathematics, supporting and assisting the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) and other international scientific meetings/conferences, acknowledging outstanding research contributions to mathematics through the awarding of scientific prizes, and encouraging and supporting other international mathematical activities, considered likely to contribute to the development of mathematical science in any of its aspects, whether pure, applied, or educational.\n\nThe IMU was established in 1920, but dissolved in September 1932 and then re-established 1950 de facto at the Constitutive Convention in New York, de jure on September 10, 1951, when ten countries had become members. The last milestone was the General Assembly in March 1952, in Rome, Italy where the activities of the new IMU were inaugurated and the first Executive Committee, President and various commissions where elected. In 1952 the IMU was also readmitted to the ICSU. The past president of the Union is [[Ingrid Daubechies]] (2011\u20132014). The current president is [[Shigefumi Mori]] who is the first head of the group from Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/12/national/kyoto-university-professor-elected-head-international-mathematical-union/|title=Kyoto University professor elected head of International Mathematical Union|date=12 August 2014|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2017|via=Japan Times Online}}</ref>\n\nAt the 16th meeting of the IMU General Assembly in Bangalore, India, in August 2010, [[Berlin]] was chosen as the location of the permanent office of the IMU, which was opened on January 1, 2011, and is hosted by the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics  (WIAS), an institute of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]], with about 120 scientists engaging in mathematical research applied to complex problems in industry and commerce.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.icm2010.org.in/imu-general-assembley-2010 |title=IMU General Assembly in Bangalore, India in August 2010 |access-date=2011-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903052817/http://www.icm2010.org.in/imu-general-assembley-2010 |archive-date=2011-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wias-berlin.de/|title=Weierstrass Institute|website=www.wias-berlin.de|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Commissions and committees==\nIMU has a close relationship to mathematics education through its [[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]] (ICMI). This commission is organized similarly to IMU with its own Executive Committee and General Assembly.\n\nDeveloping countries are a high priority for the IMU and a significant percentage of its budget, including grants received from individuals, mathematical societies, foundations, and funding agencies, is spent on activities for developing countries. Since 2011 this has been coordinated by the [http://www.mathunion.org/cdc Commission for Developing Countries (CDC)].\n\nThe [https://www.mathunion.org/cwm Committee for Women in Mathematics (CWM)] is concerned with issues related to women in mathematics worldwide. It organizes the [https://www.worldwomeninmaths.org/ World Meeting for Women in Mathematics <math display=\"inline\">((\\mathrm{WM})^2)</math>] as a satellite event of ICM.\n\nThe [[International Commission on the History of Mathematics]] (ICHM) is operated jointly by the IMU and the Division of the History of Science (DHS) of the [[International Union of History and Philosophy of Science]] (IUHPS).\n\nThe Committee on Electronic Information and Communication (CEIC) advises IMU on matters concerning mathematical information, communication, and publishing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/ceic|title=CEIC|first=IMU Committee on Electronic Information and|last=Communication|website=www.mathunion.org|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Prizes==\nThe scientific prizes awarded by the IMU are deemed to be the highest distinctions in the mathematical world.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The opening ceremony of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) is where the awards are presented: [[Fields Medal]]s (two to four medals are given since 1936), the Rolf [[Nevanlinna Prize]] (since 1986), the [[Carl Friedrich Gauss Prize]] (since 2006), and the [[Chern Medal|Chern Medal Award]] (since 2010).\n\n==Membership and General Assembly==\nThe IMU's members are Member Countries and each Member country is represented through an Adhering Organization, which may be its principal academy, a mathematical society, its research council or some other institution or association of institutions, or an appropriate agency of its government. A country starting to develop its mathematical culture and interested in building links to mathematicians all over the world is invited to join IMU as an Associate Member. For the purpose of facilitating jointly sponsored activities and jointly pursuing the objectives of the IMU, multinational mathematical societies and professional societies can join IMU as an Affiliate Member. Every four years the IMU membership gathers in a General Assembly (GA) which consists of delegates appointed by the Adhering Organizations, together with the members of the Executive Committee. All important decisions are made at the GA, including the election of the officers, establishment of commissions, the approval of the budget, and any changes to the statutes and by-laws.\n\n==Organization and Executive Committee==\nThe International Mathematical Union is administered by an Executive Committee (EC) which conducts the business of the Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mathunion.org/organization/imu-executive-committee|title=International Mathematical Union (IMU): Executive Committee|first=}}</ref> The EC consists of the President, two Vice-Presidents, the Secretary, six Members-at-Large, all elected for a term of four years, and the Past President. The EC is responsible for all policy matters and for tasks, such as choosing the members of the ICM Program Committee and various prize committees.\n\n==Publications==\nEvery two months IMU publishes an electronic newsletter, ''IMU-Net'', that aims to improve communication between IMU and the worldwide mathematical community by reporting on decisions and recommendations of the Union, major international mathematical events and developments, and on other topics of general mathematical interest. IMU Bulletins are published annually with the aim to inform IMU\u2019s members about the Union\u2019s current activities. In 2009 IMU published the document ''Best Current Practices for Journals''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/CEIC/bestpractice/bpfinal.pdf|title=Best Current Practices for Journals|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==IMU\u2019s Involvement in Developing Countries==\nThe IMU took its first organized steps towards the promotion of mathematics in developing countries in the early 1970s and has, since then supported various activities. In 2010 IMU formed the Commission for Developing Countries (CDC) which brings together all of the past and current initiatives in support of mathematics and mathematicians in the developing world.\n\nSome IMU Supported Initiatives:\n*''Grants Program for Mathematicians:'' The Commission for Developing Countries supports research travel of mathematicians based in developing countries as well as mathematics research conferences in the developing world through its Grants Program which is open to mathematicians throughout the developing world, including countries that are not (yet) members of the IMU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/cdc/grants/|title=Grants - CDC|first=IMU Commission for Developing|last=Countries|website=www.mathunion.org|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n*''African Mathematics Millennium Science Initiative'' (AMMSI) is a network of mathematics centers in sub-Saharan Africa that organizes conferences and workshops, visiting lectureships and an extensive scholarship program for mathematics graduate students doing PhD work on the African continent.\n*''Mentoring African Research in Mathematics (MARM):'' IMU supported the London Mathematical Society (LMS) in founding the MARM programme, which supports mathematics and its teaching in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa via a mentoring partnership between mathematicians in the United Kingdom and African colleagues, together with their students. It focuses on cultivating long-term mentoring relations between individual mathematicians and students.\n*''Volunteer Lecturer Program'' (VLP) of IMU identifies mathematicians interested in contributing to the formation of young mathematicians in the developing world. The Volunteer Lecturer Program maintains a database of mathematic volunteers willing to offer month-long intensive courses at the advanced undergraduate or graduate level in degree programmes at universities in the developing world. IMU also seeks applications from universities and mathematics degree programmes in the developing world that are in need of volunteer lecturers, and that can provide the necessary conditions for productive collaboration in the teaching of advanced mathematics.\n\nIMU also supports the ''[[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]]'' (ICMI) with its programmes, exhibits and workshops in emerging countries, especially in Asia and Africa.\n\nIMU released a report in 2008, ''Mathematics in Africa: Challenges and Opportunities'', on the current state of mathematics in Africa and on opportunities for new initiatives to support mathematical development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Report/Mathematics_in_Africa_Challenges___Opportunities.pdf|title=Mathematics in Africa: Challenges and Opportunities|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref> In 2014, the IMU's Commission for Developing Countries CDC released an update of the report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/CDC/cdc-uploads/CDC_MENAO/Africa_Report.pdf|title=''Mathematics in Africa'' 2014 Update|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, reports about ''Mathematics in Latin America and the Caribbean and South East Asia''.<ref>\n[http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/CDC/cdc-uploads/CDC_MENAO/Mathematics_in_Latin_America_and_the_Caribbean.Report.pdf ''Mathematics in Latin America'' report]</ref> were published.\n\nIn July 2014 IMU released the report: The International Mathematical Union in the Developing World: Past, Present and Future (July 2014).\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/CDC/cdc-uploads/CVgrantsConference/The_INTERNATIONAL_MATHEMATICAL_UNION_in_the_DEVELOPING_WORLD-_Past__Present_and_Future.pdf|title=''The International Mathematical Union in the Developing World''|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== MENAO Symposium at the ICM ==\n\nIn 2014, the IMU held a day-long symposium prior to the opening of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), entitled ''Mathematics in Emerging Nations: Achievements and Opportunities'' (MENAO).

Its members are national scientific bodies and international scientific unions. \n\nIn July 2018 ICSU merged with the [[International Social Science Council|International Social Science Council (ISSC)]] to form the [[International Science Council]].\n\nIn 2017 ICSU comprised 122 multi-disciplinary National Scientific Members, Associates and Observers representing 142 countries and 31 international, disciplinary Scientific Unions. ICSU also had 22 Scientific Associates.<ref>[https://www.icsu.org/about-us/our-members ICSU\u2019s Our Members web page], updated on 6 October 2017</ref>\n\n==Mission and principles==\nICSU\u2019s mission was to strengthen international science for the benefit of society. To do this, ICSU mobilized the knowledge and resources of the [[international]] [[scientific community]] to:\n\n*Identify and address major issues of importance to science and society.\n*Facilitate interaction amongst scientists across all disciplines and from all countries.\n*Promote the participation of all scientists \u2014 regardless of race, citizenship, language, political stance, or gender \u2014 in the international scientific endeavour.\n*Provide independent, authoritative advice to stimulate constructive dialogue between the scientific community and governments, civil society, and the private sector.\"<ref>[http://www.icsu.org/about-icsu/about-us ICSU\u2019s About Us web page], updated on 14 December 2011</ref>\n\nActivities focused on three areas: International Research Collaboration, Science for Policy, and Universality of Science.\n\n==History==\nIn 2018 ICSU became the International Science Council. \n\nICSU itself was one of the oldest [[non-governmental organization]]s in the world, representing the evolution and expansion of two earlier bodies known as the [[International Association of Academies]] (IAA; 1899-1914) and the International Research Council (IRC; 1919-1931). In 1998, Members agreed that the Council\u2019s current composition and activities would be better reflected by modifying the name from the International Council of Scientific Unions to the International Council for Science, while its rich history and strong identity would be well served by retaining the existing acronym, ICSU.<ref>[https://www.icsu.org/about-us/a-brief-history ICSU\u2019s A Brief History web page], updated on 6 October 2017</ref>\n\n==Universality of science==\nThe ICSU Principle of Universality of Science states: \"''the free and responsible practice of science is fundamental to scientific advancement and human and environmental well-being. Such practice, in all its aspects, requires freedom of movement, association, expression and communication for scientists, as well as equitable access to data, information, and other resources for research. It requires responsibility at all levels to carry out and communicate scientific work with integrity, respect, fairness, trustworthiness, and transparency, recognising its benefits and possible harms.<br>\n''In advocating the free and responsible practice of science, ICSU promotes equitable opportunities for access to science and its benefits, and opposes discrimination based on such factors as ethnic origin, religion, citizenship, language, political or other opinion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or age.''\" <ref>{{cite book|last1=International Council for Science|title=Statutes and Rules of Procedure|date=September 2011|publisher=ISCU|location=Paris, France|pages=2|url=https://www.icsu.org/cms/2017/05/Statutes_September_2011.pdf|accessdate=6 October 2017}}</ref>\nAdherence to this Principle is a condition of ICSU membership. The Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science (CFRS) \"serves as the guardian of the Principle and undertakes a variety of actions to defend scientific freedoms and promote integrity and responsibility.\"<ref>[https://www.icsu.org/what-we-do/freedoms-and-responsibilities-of-scientists ICSU\u2019s Universality of Science web section], updated on 6 October 2017</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nThe ICSU Secretariat (20 staff in 2012) in Paris ensured the day-to-day planning and operations under the guidance of an elected Executive Board. Three Policy Committees \u2212 Committee on Scientific Planning and Review (CSPR), Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science (CFRS) and Committee on Finance \u2212 assisted the Executive Board in its work and a General Assembly of all Members was convened every three years. ICSU has three Regional Offices \u2212 Africa, Asia and the Pacific as well as Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n==Finances==\nThe principal source of ICSU's finances was the contributions it receives from its members. Other sources of income are the framework contracts from [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) and grants and contracts from [[United Nations]] bodies, foundations and agencies, which are used to support the scientific activities of the ICSU Unions and interdisciplinary bodies.\n\n==Member Scientific Unions==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It does this through the setting of [[international standards]], the co-ordination of the endeavours of the world's [[national hydrographic office]]s, and through its capacity building programme.\n \nThe IHO enjoys observer status at the [[United Nations]] where it is the recognised competent authority on [[hydrographic surveying]] and [[nautical chart]]ing. When referring to hydrography and nautical charting in Conventions and similar Instruments, it is the IHO standards and specifications that are normally used.\n\n==History==\nThe '''IHO''' was established in 1921 as the '''International Hydrographic Bureau''' (IHB). The present name was adopted in 1970 as part of a new international Convention on the IHO adopted by the then member nations. The former name International Hydrographic Bureau was retained to describe the IHO secretariat until 8 November 2016, when a revision to the Convention on the IHO entered into force.  Thereafter the IHB became known as the \"IHO Secretariat\", comprising an elected Secretary-General and two supporting Directors, together with a small staff of 17, at the Organization's headquarters in Monaco. \n\nDuring the 19th century, many maritime nations established hydrographic offices to provide means for improving the navigation of naval and merchant [[marine vessel|vessel]]s by providing nautical publications, nautical charts, and other [[navigation]]al services. There were substantial differences in hydrographic procedures charts, and publications. In 1889, an International Maritime Conference was held at [[Washington, D.C.]], and it was proposed to establish a \"permanent international commission.\" Similar proposals were made at the sessions of the International Congress of Navigation held at [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1908 and the International Maritime Conference held at [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1912.\n\nIn 1919 the [[hydrographer]]s of Great Britain and France cooperated in taking the necessary steps to convene an international conference of hydrographers. London was selected as the most suitable place for this conference, and on 24 July 1919, the First International Conference opened, attended by the hydrographers of 24 nations. The object of the conference was \"To consider the advisability of all maritime nations adopting similar methods in preparation, construction, and production of their charts and all hydrographic publications; of rendering the results in the most convenient form to enable them to be readily used; of instituting a prompt system of mutual exchange of hydrographic information between all countries; and of providing an opportunity to consultations and discussions to be carried out on hydrographic subjects generally by the hydrographic experts of the world.\" This is still the major purpose of the IHO.\n\nAs a result of the Conference, a permanent organization was formed and statutes for its operations were prepared. The IHB, now the IHO, began its activities in 1921 with 18 nations as members. The [[Principality of Monaco]] was selected as the seat of the organization as a result of the offer of [[Albert I, Prince of Monaco]] to provide suitable accommodation for the Bureau in the principality.

These standards are subsequently adopted and used by its 89 (as of June 2018) member countries and others in their surveys, nautical charts, and publications. The almost universal use of the IHO standards means that the products and services provided by the world's national hydrographic and oceanographic offices are consistent and recognisable by all seafarers and for other users. Much has been done in the field of standardisation since the Bureau (now the IHO) was founded.\n\nThe IHO has encouraged the formation of Regional Hydrographic Commissions (RHCs). Each RHC coordinates the national surveying and charting activities of countries within each region and acts as a forum to address other matters of common hydrographic interest.  The 15 RHCs plus the IHO Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica (HCA) effectively cover the world.\n\nThe IHO, in partnership with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), directs the [[General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans]] programme.\n\n'''Main achievements of this organization:''' \n\nEstablishment of the Chart Specifications Committee and International Charts. Great improvements have taken place in the following topics:\n\n1) The exploration of the seabed and movements of the sea.\n\n2) Standardization of maritime measurements, hydrographic terminology, marine cartographic products and geographical information systems for navigation. Great progress has been made concerning standardization of electronic charts\n\n3) High efficiency of the rapid dissemination of information on safety at sea\n\n4) Training of hydrographers and nautical cartographers.\n\n==Publications==\nMost IHO publications, including the standards, guidelines and associated documents such as the ''International Hydrographic Review'', ''International Hydrographic Bulletin'', the ''Hydrographic Dictionary'' and the ''Year Book'' are available to the general public free of charge from the IHO website.\n\nThe IHO publishes the international standards related to charting and hydrography, including S-57, ''IHO Transfer Standard for Digital Hydrographic Data'', the encoding standard that is used primarily for [[electronic navigational chart]]s. In 2010 the IHO introduced a new, contemporary hydrographic geospatial standard for modelling marine data and information, known as S-100.  S-100 and any dependent product specifications are underpinned by an on-line registry accessible via the IHO website.  S-100 is aligned with the [[ISO 19100]] series of geographic standards, thereby making it fully compatible with contemporary [[geospatial data]] standards. Because S-100 is based on ISO 19100, it can be used by other data providers for their maritime-related (non-hydrographic) data and information. Various data and information providers from both the government and private sector are now using S-100 as part of the implementation of the [[e-Navigation]] concept that has been endorsed by the UN [[International Maritime Organisation]].\n\n== Meetings ==\nThe IHO maintains a programme of the meetings of its Council, committees and working groups around the world. The meetings and the meetings of other related International Organisations are promulgated in the calendar on the IHO website.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.iho.int/mtg_docs/misc_docs/IHO_events.htm|title = IHO Calendar of Meetings and Events / Calendrier des r\u00e9unions et des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de l'OHI|date = |accessdate = 2014-08-09|website = |publisher = International Hydrography Organization|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n== Main achievements of this organization: ==\nEstablishment of the Chart Specifications Committee and International Charts.

During the 1960s and 1970s, IBM dominated the large computer market. Current [[mainframe computer]] in IBM's line of business computers are developments of the basic design of the IBM [[System/360]].\n\n==First and second generation==\n[[File:IBM Electronic Data Processing Machine - GPN-2000-001881.jpg|thumb|right| IBM 704 mainframe at [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] in 1957]]\nFrom 1952 into the late 1960s, IBM manufactured and marketed several large computer models, known as the [[IBM 700/7000 series]]. The first-generation 700s were based on [[vacuum tube]]s, while the later, second-generation 7000s used [[transistor]]s. These machines established IBM's dominance in [[electronic data processing]] (\"EDP\"). IBM had two model categories: one (701, 704, 709, 7030, 7090, 7094, 7040, 7044) for engineering and scientific use, and one (702, 705, 705-II, 705-III, 7080, 7070, 7072, 7074, 7010) for commercial or data  processing use. The two categories, scientific and commercial, generally used common peripherals but had completely different [[instruction set]]s, and there were incompatibilities even within each category.\n\nIBM initially sold its computers without any software, expecting customers to write their own; programs were manually initiated, one at a time.  Later, IBM provided [[compilers]] for the newly developed higher-level [[programming language]]s [[Fortran]], [[COMTRAN]] and later [[COBOL]]. The first [[operating systems]] for IBM computers were written by IBM customers who did not wish to have their very expensive machines ($2M USD in the mid-1950s) sitting idle while operators set up jobs manually.  These first operating systems were essentially scheduled work queues. It is generally thought that the first operating system used for real work was [[GM-NAA I/O]], produced by [[General Motors]]' Research division in 1956. IBM enhanced one of GM-NAA I/O's successors, the [[SHARE Operating System]], and provided it to customers under the name [[IBSYS]].<ref name=\"frobeniusIBSYS\">[http://www.frobenius.com/ibsys.htm IBM 7090/94 IBSYS Operating System]</ref><ref name=\"UnisysHistNewsletterV1N3\">{{Cite journal\n | last=Gray\n | first=George\n | date=March 1999\n | title=EXEC II\n | periodical=Unisys History Newsletter\n | volume=1\n | issue=3\n | url=https://wiki.cc.gatech.edu/folklore/index.php/EXEC_II\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809171206/https://wiki.cc.gatech.edu/folklore/index.php/EXEC_II\n | archive-date=August 9, 2017\n}}</ref>  As software became more complex and important, the cost of supporting it on so many different designs became burdensome, and this was one of the factors which led IBM to develop [[System/360]] and its operating systems.<ref name=\"Boyer360Revolution\">Chuck Boyer, [http://www-306.ibm.com/software/os/zseries/pdf/360Revolution_0406.pdf ''The 360 Revolution'']</ref>\n\nThe second generation (transistor-based) products  were a mainstay of IBM's business and IBM continued to make them for several years after the introduction of the System/360. (Some [[IBM 7094]]s remained in service into the 1980s.)\n\n==Smaller machines==\n[[File:IBM 1401 signal tracing at CHM.agr.jpg|thumb|right|IBM 1401 undergoing restoration at the Computer History Museum]]\nPrior to System/360, IBM also sold computers smaller in scale that were not considered mainframes, though they were still bulky and expensive by modern standards. These included:\n\n*[[IBM 650]] (vacuum tube logic, [[decimal architecture]], [[drum memory]], business and scientific)\n*[[IBM 305 RAMAC]] (vacuum tube logic, first computer with [[disk storage]]; ''see:'' [[Early IBM disk storage]])\n*[[IBM 1400 series]] (business data processing; very successful and many 1400 peripherals were used with the 360s)\n*[[IBM 1620]] (decimal architecture, engineering, scientific, and education)\n\nIBM had difficulty getting customers to upgrade from the smaller machines to the mainframes because so much software had to be rewritten. The 7010 was introduced in 1962 as a mainframe-sized 1410. The later Systems 360 and 370 could emulate the 1400 machines. A desk size machine with a different instruction set, the [[IBM 1130]], was released concurrently with the System/360 to address the niche occupied by the 1620. It used the same [[EBCDIC]] character encoding as the 360 and was mostly programmed in [[Fortran]], which was relatively easy to adapt to larger machines when necessary.\n\n[[IBM midrange computer|''Midrange computer'']] is a designation used by IBM for a class of computer systems which fall in between mainframes and microcomputers.\n\n==IBM System/360==\n{{main|IBM System/360}} \n[[File:IBM system 360-50 console - MfK Bern.jpg|thumb|right|IBM System/360 Model 50]]\nAll that changed with the announcement of the System/360 (S/360) in April, 1964.<ref>[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PR360.html IBM Archives: System/360 Announcement]</ref> The System/360 was a single series of compatible models for both commercial and scientific use. The number \"[[360 (number)|360]]\" suggested a \"360 [[degree (angle)|degree]],\" or \"all-around\" computer system. System/360 incorporated features which had previously been present on only either the commercial line (such as decimal arithmetic and byte addressing) or the engineering and scientific line (such as [[floating point]] arithmetic). Some of the arithmetic units and addressing features were optional on some models of the System/360. However, models were upward compatible and most were also downward compatible. The System/360 was also the first computer in wide use to include dedicated hardware provisions for the use of [[operating system]]s. Among these were supervisor and application mode programs and instructions, as well as built-in memory protection facilities.  Hardware memory protection was provided to protect the operating system from the user programs (tasks) and the user tasks from each other. The new machine also had a larger [[address space]] than the older mainframes, 24 bits addressing 8-bit bytes vs. a typical 18 bits addressing 36-bit words. \n\nThe smaller models in the System/360 line (e.g. the 360/30) were intended to replace the 1400 series while providing an easier upgrade path to the larger 360s. To smooth the transition from second generation to the new line, IBM used the 360's [[microprogramming]] capability to emulate the more popular older models. Thus 360/30s with this added cost feature could run 1401 programs and the larger 360/65s could run 7094 programs. To run old programs, the 360 had to be halted and restarted in emulation mode. Many customers kept using their old software and one of the features of the later System/370 was the ability to switch to emulation mode and back under operating system control.\n\nOperating systems for the System/360 family included [[OS/360]] (with PCP, MFT, and [[Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks|MVT]]), [[BOS/360]], [[TOS/360]], and [[DOS/360]].\n\nThe System/360 later evolved into the [[System/370]], the [[System/390]], and the [[64-bit]] [[IBM System z|zSeries, System z, and zEnterprise]] machines.  System/370 introduced [[virtual memory]] capabilities in all models other than the very first System/370 models; the [[OS/VS1]] variant of OS/360 MFT, the [[OS/VS2 (SVS)]] variant of OS/360 MVT, and the DOS/VS variant of DOS/360 were introduced to use the virtual memory capabilities, followed by [[MVS]], which, unlike the earlier virtual-memory operating systems, ran separate programs in separate address spaces, rather than running all programs in a single virtual address space.  The virtual memory capabilities also allowed the system to support [[virtual machine]]s; the [[VM (operating system)|VM/370]] [[hypervisor]] would run one or more virtual machines running either standard System/360 or System/370 operating systems or the single-user [[Conversational Monitor System]] (CMS).  A [[time-sharing]] VM system could run multiple virtual machines, one per user, with each virtual machine running an instance of CMS.\n\n==Today's systems==\n{{main|IBM System z}}\n[[File:Z800 2066 JKU.jpeg|thumb|right|IBM System z800]]\nThe zSeries family, introduced in 2000 with the z900,  included IBM's newly designed 64-bit [[z/Architecture]].\n\n===Processor units===\nThe different processors on current IBM mainframes are:\n*CP, [[Central Processing Unit|Central Processor]]: general-purpose processor\n*IFL, [[Integrated Facility for Linux]]: dedicated to [[Linux]] OSes (optionally under [[z/VM]])\n*ICF, Integrated [[Coupling Facility]]: designed to support [[IBM Parallel Sysplex|Parallel Sysplex]] operations\n*SAP, System Assist Processor: designed to handle various system accounting, management, and [[I/O channel]] operations\n*[[zAAP]], System z Application Assist Processor: currently limited to run only [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[XML]] processing\n*[[zIIP]], System z Integrated Information Processor: dedicated to run specific workloads including [[IBM DB2|DB2]], [[XML]], and [[IPSec]]\n\nNote that these are essentially identical, but distinguished for software cost control: all but CP are slightly restricted such they cannot be used to run arbitrary operating systems, and thus do not count in software licensing costs (which are typically based on the number of CPs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/basics/topic/com.ibm.zos.zmainframe/zmainframe_book.pdf|title=Mainframe concepts (page 31)|author=IBM corp.|year=2005}}</ref>\nThere are other supporting processors typically installed inside mainframes such as [[cryptographic]] accelerators ([[CryptoExpress]]), the [[OSA-Express]] networking processor, and [[FICON]] Express disk I/O processors.\n\nSoftware to allow users to run \"traditional\" workloads on zIIPs and zAAPs was briefly marketed by Neon Enterprise Software as \"zPrime\" but was withdrawn from the market in 2011 after a lawsuit by IBM.<ref>{{cite web|last=Radding|first=Alan|title=Bye bye zPrime on System z|url=http://dancingdinosaur.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/bye-bye-zprime-on-system-z/|publisher=DancingDinosaur|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Operating systems===\nThe primary [[operating system]]s in use on current IBM mainframes include [[z/OS]] (which followed [[MVS#MVS/ESA|MVS/ESA]] and [[OS/390]] in the [[OS/360 and successors|OS/360]] lineage), [[z/VM]] (which followed [[VM (operating system)|VM/ESA]] and VM/XA in the [[CP/CMS|CP-40]] lineage), [[z/VSE]] (which is in the [[DOS/360 and successors|DOS/360 lineage]]), [[z/TPF]] (a successor of [[Airlines Control Program]]), and [[Linux on z Systems]] such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and others.

It became the home of the superintendent of the Model Farm and in later years, the deans of Agriculture, including Seaman Knapp and \"Tama Jim\" Wilson. Iowa State's first president, [[Adonijah Welch]], briefly stayed at the Farm House and penned his inaugural speech in a second floor bedroom.<ref name=\"of Iowa State Time Line, 1858\u20131874\"/>\n\nThe college's first farm tenants primed the land for agricultural experimentation. The Iowa Experiment Station was one of the university's prominent features.  Practical courses of instruction were taught, including one designed to give a general training for the career of a farmer.  Courses in [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[civil engineering|civil]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], and [[mining engineering]] were also part of the curriculum.\n\nIn 1870, President Welch and I. P. Robert, professor of agriculture, held three-day farmers' institutes at [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]], [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]], [[Washington, Iowa|Washington]], and [[Muscatine, Iowa|Muscatine]].  These became the earliest institutes held off-campus by a land grant institution and were the forerunners of 20th century extension.\n\nIn 1872, the first courses were given in domestic economy (home economics, family and consumer sciences) and were taught by Mary B. Welch, the president's wife.  Iowa State became the first land grant university in the nation to offer training in domestic economy for college credit.<ref name=\"of Iowa State Time Line, 1858\u20131874\"/>\n\nIn 1879, the \"School\" of Veterinary Science was organized, the first state veterinary college in the United States (although veterinary courses has been taught since the beginning of the College).  This was originally a two-year course leading to a diploma.

Noyes, who also donated the funds to see that Alumni Hall could be completed after sitting unfinished and unused from 1905 to 1907.  Dr. Noyes is an 1872 alumnus. Lake LaVerne is located west of the [[#Memorial Union|Memorial Union]] and south of Alumni Hall, [[#Carver Hall|Carver Hall]], and [[#Music Hall|Music Hall]].  The lake was a gift from Dr. Noyes in 1916.\n\nLake LaVerne is the home of two [[mute swan]]s named Sir Lancelot and Elaine, donated to Iowa State by VEISHEA 1935.<ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/VEISHEA/swans.htm Swans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607113121/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/VEISHEA/swans.htm |date=2011-06-07 }} from the Iowa State Library's special exhibits section</ref>  In 1944, 1970, and 1971 [[Cygnet (bird)|cygnets]]  (baby swans) made their home on Lake LaVerne.

In support of Iowa Department of Natural Resources efforts to re-establish the trumpeter swans in Iowa, university officials avoided bringing breeding pairs of male and female mute swans to Iowa State which means the current Sir Lancelot and Elaine are both female.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.iastate.edu/oldreleases/2003/mar/swans.shtml|title=News Releases: Iowa State University|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>\n\n=== Reiman Gardens ===\n[[Image:RG Conservatory Inside.jpg|thumb|Tropical conservatory, [[Reiman Gardens]]]]\nIowa State has maintained a [[horticulture]] garden since 1914. [[Reiman Gardens]] is the third location for these gardens. Today's gardens began in 1993 with a gift from [[Roy Reiman|Bobbi and Roy Reiman]]. Construction began in 1994 and the Gardens' initial {{convert|5|acre|m2}} were officially dedicated on September 16, 1995.\n\nReiman Gardens has since grown to become a {{convert|14|acre|m2}} site consisting of a dozen distinct garden areas, an indoor conservatory and an indoor butterfly \"wing\", butterfly emergence cases, a gift shop, and several supporting greenhouses. Located immediately south of [[Jack Trice Stadium]] on the ISU campus, Reiman Gardens is a year-round facility that has become one of the most visited attractions in central Iowa.\n\nThe Gardens has received a number of national, state, and local awards since its opening, and its [[rose garden]]s are particularly noteworthy.  It was honored with the President's Award in 2000 by All American Rose Selections, Inc., which is presented to one public garden in the [[United States]] each year for superior rose maintenance and display: \u201cFor contributing to the public interest in rose growing through its efforts in maintaining an outstanding public rose garden.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reimangardens.com/en/awards_and_publications/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807173000/http://www.reimangardens.com/en/awards_and_publications/ |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== University Museums ===\nThe University Museums consist of the Brunnier Art Museum, Farm House Museum, the Art on Campus Program, the Christian Petersen Art Museum, and the Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden.

Brunnier and his wife Ann. The decorative arts collection they donated, called the Brunnier Collection, is extensive, consisting of ceramics, glass, dolls, ivory, jade, and enameled metals.\n\nOther fine and decorative art objects from the University Art Collection include prints, paintings, sculptures, textiles, carpets, wood objects, lacquered pieces, silver, and furniture. About eight to 12 annual changing exhibitions and permanent collection exhibitions provide educational opportunities for all ages, from learning the history of a quilt hand-stitched over 100 years ago to discovering how scientists analyze the physical properties of artists' materials, such as glass or stone.  Lectures, receptions, conferences, university classes, panel discussions, gallery walks, and gallery talks are presented to assist with further interpretation of objects.\n\n==== Farm House Museum ====\n[[Image:Farm House Museum south sign.jpg|thumb|The Farm House Museum]]\n{{main|The Farm House (Knapp\u2013Wilson House)}}\nLocated near the center of the Iowa State campus, the Farm House Museum sits as a monument to early Iowa State history and culture as well as a [[National Historic Landmark]].  As the first building on campus, the Farm House was built in 1860 before campus was occupied by students or even classrooms. The college's first farm tenants primed the land for agricultural experimentation. This early practice lead to Iowa State Agricultural College and Model Farm opening its doors to Iowa students for free in 1869 under the [[Morrill Act of 1862|Morrill Act]] (or Land-grant Act) of 1862.<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/FarmHouse.htm Iowa State University Museums Farm House Museum online]</ref>\n\nMany prominent figures have made the Farm House their home throughout its 150 years of use. The first president of the College, [[Adonijah Welch]], briefly stayed at the Farm House and even wrote his inaugural speech in a bedroom on the second floor.  James \u201cTama Jim\u201d Wilson resided for much of the 1890s with his family at the Farm House until he joined President [[William McKinley]]'s cabinet as [[U.S. Secretary of Agriculture]]. Agriculture Dean [[Charles Curtiss]] and his young family replaced Wilson and became the longest resident of Farm House.\n\nIn 1976, over 110 years after the initial construction, the Farm House became a museum after much time and effort was put into restoring the early beauty of the modest farm home.  Today, faculty, students, and community members can enjoy the museum while honoring its significance in shaping a nationally recognized land-grant university. Its collection boasts a large collection of 19th and early 20th century decorative arts, furnishings and material culture reflecting Iowa State and Iowa heritage.  Objects include furnishings from [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] and Charles Curtiss, a wide variety of quilts, a modest collection of textiles and apparel, and various china and glassware items.\n\nAs with many sites on the Iowa State University Campus, The Farm House Museum has a few old [[Iowa State Myths and Legends|myths and legends]] associated with it. There are rumors of a ghost changing silverware and dinnerware, unexplained rattling furniture, and curtains that have opened seemingly by themselves.\n\nThe Farm House Museum is a unique on-campus educational resource providing a changing environment of exhibitions among the historical permanent collection objects that are on display. A walk through the Farm House Museum immerses visitors in the [[Victorian era]] (1860-1910) as well as exhibits colorful Iowa and local Ames history.\n\n==== Art on Campus Collection ====\nIowa State is home to one of the largest campus public art programs in the United States.  Over 2,000 works of public art, including 600 by significant national and international artists, are located across campus in buildings, courtyards, open spaces and offices.<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/AOC.htm Iowa State University Museums Art on Campus online]</ref>\n\nThe traditional public art program began during the Depression in the 1930s when Iowa State College's President Raymond Hughes envisioned that \"the arts would enrich and provide substantial intellectual exploration into our college curricula.\" Hughes invited [[Grant Wood]] to create the Library's agricultural murals that speak to the founding of Iowa and Iowa State College and Model Farm. He also offered [[Christian Petersen (sculptor)|Christian Petersen]] a one-semester sculptor residency to design and build the fountain and bas relief at the Dairy Industry Building. In 1955, 21 years later, Petersen retired having created 12 major sculptures for the campus and hundreds of small studio sculptures.\n\nThe Art on Campus Collection is a campus-wide resource of over 2000 public works of art. Programs, receptions, dedications, university classes, Wednesday Walks, and educational tours are presented on a regular basis to enhance visual literacy and aesthetic appreciation of this diverse collection.\n\n==== Christian Petersen Art Museum ====\n[[Image:Justin Smith Morrill - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Justin Smith Morrill]], namesake of Morrill Hall]]\nThe Christian Petersen Art Museum in [[Morrill Hall (Iowa State University)|Morrill Hall]] is named for the nation's first permanent campus artist-in-residence, [[Christian Petersen (sculptor)|Christian Petersen]], who sculpted and taught at Iowa State from 1934 through 1955, and is considered the founding artist of the Art on Campus Collection.\n\nNamed for [[Justin Smith Morrill]] who created the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], Morrill Hall was completed in 1891.  Originally constructed to fill the capacity of a library, museum, and chapel, its original uses are engraved in the exterior stonework on the east side.  The building was vacated in 1996 when it was determined unsafe and was also listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] the same year.  In 2005, $9 million was raised to renovate the building and convert it into a museum.  Completed and reopened in March 2007, Morrill Hall is home to the Christian Petersen Art Museum.\n\nAs part of University Museums, the Christian Petersen Art Museum at Morrill Hall is the home of the Christian Petersen Art Collection, the Art on Campus Program, the University Museums's Visual Literacy and Learning Program, and Contemporary Changing Art Exhibitions Program.\n\nLocated within the Christian Petersen Art Museum are the Lyle and Nancy Campbell Art Gallery, the Roy and Bobbi Reiman Public Art Studio Gallery, the Margaret Davidson Center for the Study of the Art on Campus Collection, the Edith D. and Torsten E. Lagerstrom Loaned Collections Center, and the Neva M. Petersen Visual Learning Gallery. University Museums shares the James R. and Barbara R. Palmer Small Objects Classroom in Morrill Hall.<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/CPAM.htm Iowa State University Museums Christian Petersen Art Museum online]</ref>\n\n==== Anderson Sculpture Garden ====\nThe Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden is located by the Christian Petersen Art Museum at historic Morrill Hall. The [[sculpture garden]] design incorporates sculptures, a gathering arena, and sidewalks and pathways. Planted with perennials, ground cover, shrubs, and flowering trees, the landscape design provides a distinctive setting for important works of 20th and 21st century sculpture, primarily American.  Ranging from forty-four inches to nearly nine feet high and from bronze to other metals, these works of art represent the richly diverse character of modern and contemporary sculpture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museums.iastate.edu/ASGMain.htm|title=Anderson Sculpture Garden Main|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe sculpture garden is adjacent to Iowa State's {{convert|22|acre|m2}} central campus. Adonijah Welch, ISU's first president, envisioned a picturesque campus with a winding road encircling the college's majestic buildings, vast lawns of green grass, many varieties of trees sprinkled throughout to provide shade, and shrubbery and flowers for fragrance. Today, the central lawn continues to be an iconic place for all Iowa Staters, and enjoys national acclaim as one of the most beautiful campuses in the country.  The new Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden further enhances the beauty of Iowa State.\n\n=== Sustainability ===\nIowa State's composting facility \"can handle more than 10,000 tons of organic wastes annually.\"<ref name=\"ISU promotes sustainability via an all-university compost facility.\">{{cite web\n| title =ISU promotes sustainability via an all-university compost facility| publisher =Iowa State University News| url =http://www.public.iastate.edu/~nscentral/news/2009/may/compost.shtml\n| accessdate = 2009-06-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"New web site charts campus building energy use\">{{cite web| title =New web site charts campus building energy use| publisher =Iowa State University| url =http://www.iastate.edu/Inside/2009/0417/energywatch.shtml| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090420225219/http://www.iastate.edu/Inside/2009/0417/energywatch.shtml| dead-url =yes| archive-date =2009-04-20| accessdate =2009-06-10}}</ref> The school's new $3 million revolving loan fund loans money for energy efficiency and conservation projects on campus.<ref name=\"Live Green revolving loan fund\">{{cite web| title =Live Green revolving loan fund| publisher =Iowa State University News| url =http://www.livegreen.iastate.edu/loan/| accessdate =2009-06-10| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090503104949/http://www.livegreen.iastate.edu/loan/| archivedate =2009-05-03| df =}}</ref> In the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card issued by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, the university received a B grade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/iowa-state-university |title=Iowa State University - Green Report Card 2011 |publisher=Greenreportcard.org |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n\n== Student life ==\n\n=== Residence halls ===\n[[File:Roberts Residence Hall Iowa State University.jpg|thumb|View looking east towards Roberts Hall]]\n\nIowa State operates 20 on-campus [[dormitory|residence halls]].

The ISU Student Government is composed of a president, vice president, finance director, cabinet appointed by the president, a clerk appointed by the vice president, senators representing each college and residence area at the university, a nine-member judicial branch and an election commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.iastate.edu/|title=Government of the Student Body - Iowa State University|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>\n\n=== Student organizations ===\n[[Image:Memorial Union east.jpg|thumb|Memorial Union]]\nISU has over 800 student organizations on campus that represent a variety of interests. Organizations are supported by Iowa State's Student Activities Center. Many student organization offices are housed in the [[Memorial Union (Iowa State University)|Memorial Union]].\n\nThe Memorial Union at Iowa State University opened in September 1928 and is currently home to a number of University departments and student organizations, a bowling alley, the University Book Store, and the Hotel Memorial Union.\n\nThe original building was designed by architect, William T. Proudfoot. The building employs a classical style of [[architecture]] reflecting [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] influences. The building's design specifically complements the designs of the major buildings surrounding the University's Central Campus area, Beardshear Hall to the west, Curtiss Hall to the east, and MacKay Hall to the north.  The style utilizes columns with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals, Paladian windows, triangular [[pediments]], and formally balanced [[facades]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mu.iastate.edu/en/about_the_mu/architecture|title=Architecture|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>\n\nDesigned to be a living memorial for ISU students lost in [[World War I]], the building includes a solemn memorial hall, named the Gold Star Room, which honors the names of the dead World War I, [[World War II]], [[Korean War|Korean]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and [[War on Terrorism]] veterans engraved in marble.  Symbolically, the hall was built directly over a library (the Browsing Library) and a small chapel, the symbol being that no country would ever send its young men to die in a war for a noble cause without a solid foundation on both education (the library) and religion (the chapel).\n\nRenovations and additions have continued through the years to include: elevators, bowling lanes, a parking ramp, a book store, food court, and additional wings.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe Choral Division of the Department of Music and Theater at Iowa State University consists of over 400 choristers in four main ensembles \u2013 the ''Iowa State Singers'', ''Cantamus,'' the ''Iowa Statesmen'', and ''Lyrica'' \u2013 and multiple small ensembles including three a cappella groups, ''Count Me In'' (female), ''Shy of a Dozen'' (male), and \"Hymn and Her\" (co-ed).\n\n=== Greek community ===\nISU is home to an active [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek community]]. There are 50 chapters that involve 14.6 percent of undergraduate students. Collectively, [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] and [[sorority]] members have raised over $82,000 for philanthropies and committed 31,416 hours to community service. In 2006, the ISU Greek community was named the best large Greek community in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Greek Community Membership Statistics |publisher=Iowa State University Office of Greek Affairs |url=http://www.greek.iastate.edu/resources/Greek-Community-Statistics-Fall07.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516095715/http://www.greek.iastate.edu/resources/Greek-Community-Statistics-Fall07.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-16 |accessdate=2008-08-07 |format=PDF |date=2007-11-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe ISU Greek Community has received multiple Jellison and Sutherland Awards from Association for Fraternal Leadership and Values, formerly the Mid-American Greek Council Association.

The first sorority, I.C. Sorocis, was established only two years later, in 1877. I.C. Sorocis later became a chapter of the first national sorority at Iowa State, [[Pi Beta Phi]]. Anti-Greek rioting occurred in 1888. As reported in ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'', \"The anti-secret society men of the college met in a mob last night about 11 o'clock in front of the society rooms in chemical and physical hall, determined to break up a joint meeting of three secret societies.\" In 1891, President William Beardshear banned students from joining secret college fraternities, resulting in the eventual closing of all formerly established fraternities.

The ''Daily'' has its roots from a news sheet titled the ''Clipper'', which was started in the spring of 1890 by a group of students at Iowa Agricultural College led by F.E. Davidson. The ''Clipper'' soon led to the creation of the ''Iowa Agricultural College Student'', and the beginnings of what would one day become the ''Iowa State Daily''.  It was awarded the 2016 Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper by the Society of Professional Journalists.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.greenlee.iastate.edu/news/2016/spring/iowa-state-daily-named-best-student-newspaper-country |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018194910/https://www.greenlee.iastate.edu/news/2016/spring/iowa-state-daily-named-best-student-newspaper-country |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-10-18 |title=Iowa State Daily Named Best Student Newspaper in the Country &#124; Greenlee School of Journalism and Communication |publisher=Greenlee.iastate.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-18 }}</ref>\n\n=== Campus radio ===\n{{main|KURE}}\n88.5 KURE is the university's student-run radio station.

It is housed in the former WOI-TV station that was established in 1950. The student organization of ISUtv has many programs including Newswatch, a twice weekly news spot, Cyclone InCyders, the campus sports show, Fortnightly News, a satirical/comedy program, and Cy's Eyes on the Skies, a twice weekly weather show.\n\n== Athletics ==\n{{main|Iowa State Cyclones}}\n[[File:Big 12 logo in Iowa State colors.svg|left|thumb|[[Big 12 Conference]] logo]]\nThe \"Cyclones\" name dates back to 1895. That year, Iowa suffered an unusually high number of devastating cyclones (as [[tornado]]es were called at the time). In September, Iowa Agricultural College's football team traveled to [[Northwestern University]] and defeated that team by a score of 36-0. The next day, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s headline read \"Struck by a Cyclone: It Comes from Iowa and Devastates Evanston Town.\"<ref name=\"isutimeline1875\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iastate.edu/~isu150/history/timeline-1875.html|title=Iowa State University Time Line, 1875-1899 |work=iastate.edu}}</ref> The article began, \"Northwestern might as well have tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the Iowa team it met yesterday.\" The nickname stuck.\n\nThe school colors are [[cardinal (color)|cardinal]] and [[gold (color)|gold]]. The mascot is [[Cy the Cardinal]], introduced in 1954. Since a cyclone was determined to be difficult to depict in costume, the cardinal was chosen in reference to the school colors. A contest was held to select a name for the mascot, with the name Cy being chosen as the winner.\n\nThe Iowa State Cyclones are a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]] and compete in [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS), fielding 16 varsity teams in 12 sports. The Cyclones also compete in and are a founding member of the [[Central States Collegiate Hockey League]] of the [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]].\n\nIowa State's intrastate [[College rivalry|archrival]] is the [[University of Iowa]] with whom it competes annually for the [[Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series]] trophy, an annual athletic competition between the two schools. Sponsored by the Iowa Corn Growers Association, the competition includes all head-to-head regular season competitions between the two rival universities in all sports.\n\n=== Football ===\n{{main|Iowa State Cyclones football}}\n[[Image:Jack trice stadium south endzone.jpg|thumb|[[Jack Trice Stadium]]]]\nFootball first made its way onto the Iowa State campus in 1878 as a recreational sport, but it was not until 1892 that Iowa State organized its first team to represent the school in football.  In 1894, college president William M. Beardshear spearheaded the foundation of an athletic association to officially sanction Iowa State football teams.

The main rival is the [[Iowa\u2013Iowa State football rivalry|Iowa Hawkeyes]]. Unfortunately for Iowa State, this competition has not gone well in recent years. The Hawkeyes have won the last four games. Nevertheless, this rivalry has provided excitement for fans from Ames and Iowa City alike.\n\n[[Image:MattCampbellISU2016.jpeg|left|thumb|Head coach [[Matt Campbell (American football coach)|Matt Campbell]]]]\nThe Cyclones play their home games at [[Jack Trice Stadium]], named after [[Jack Trice]], ISU's first [[African-American]] athlete and also the first and only Iowa State athlete to die from injuries sustained during athletic competition.  Trice died three days after his first game playing for Iowa State against [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] on October 6, 1923.  Suffering from a broken collarbone early in the game, he continued to play until he was trampled by a group of Minnesota players.

Hoiberg (\"The Mayor\") played three seasons under legendary coach [[Johnny Orr (basketball, born 1927)|Johnny Orr]] and one season under future [[Chicago Bulls]] coach [[Tim Floyd]] during his standout collegiate career as a Cyclone (1991\u201395).  Orr laid the foundation of success in men's basketball upon his arrival from [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in 1980 and is credited with building Hilton Magic.  Besides Hoiberg, other Cyclone greats played for Orr and brought winning seasons, including [[Jeff Grayer]], [[Barry Stevens (basketball)|Barry Stevens]], and walk-on [[Jeff Hornacek]].  The 1985-86 Cyclones were one of the most memorable.  Orr coached the team to second place in the [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]] and produced one of his greatest career wins, a victory over his former team and No. 2 seed [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in the second round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]].\n\nUnder coaches Floyd (1995\u201398) and [[Larry Eustachy]] (1998\u20132003), Iowa State achieved even greater success.

Seeded No. 2 in the 2000 NCAA tournament, Eustachy and the Cyclones defeated [[UCLA]] in the Sweet Sixteen before falling to [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]], the eventual NCAA Champion, in the regional finals by a score of 75-64 (the differential representing the [[Michigan State Spartans|Spartans]]' narrowest margin of victory in the tournament).  Standout [[Marcus Fizer]] and [[Jamaal Tinsley]] were scoring leaders for the Cyclones who finished the season 32-5.  Tinsley returned to lead the Cyclones the following year with another conference title and No. 2 seed, but ISU finished the season with a 25-6 overall record after a stunning loss to No. 15 seed [[Hampton University|Hampton]] in the first round.\n\nIn 2011-12, Hoiberg's Cyclones finished third in the Big 12 and returned to the NCAA Tournament, dethroning defending national champion [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]], 77-64, in the second round before losing in the Round of 32 to top-seeded [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]].  All-Big 12 First Team selection [[Royce White]] led the Cyclones with 38 points and 22 rebounds in the two contests, ending the season at 23-11.\n\nThe 2013-14 campaign turned out to be another highly successful season.  Iowa State went 28-8, won the Big 12 Tournament, and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by beating [[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]] in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Cyclones finished 11-7 in Big 12 play, finishing in a tie for third in the league standings, and beat a school-record nine teams (9-3) that were ranked in the Associated Press top 25.  The Cyclones opened the season 14-0, breaking the school record for consecutive wins. [[Melvin Ejim]] was named the Big 12 Player of the Year and an All-American by five organizations.  Deandre Kane was named the Big 12 Tournament's most valuable player.\n\nOn June 8, 2015, Steve Prohm took over as head basketball coach replacing Hoiberg who left to take the head coaching position with the Chicago Bulls.  In his first season with the Cyclones, Prohm secured a #4 seed in the Midwest region where the Cyclones advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before falling to top-seeded [[University of Virginia|Virginia]], 84-71. In 2017, Iowa State stunned 3rd ranked [[University of Kansas|Kansas]], 92-89, in overtime, snapping KU's 54-game home winning streak, before winning the [[2017 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament]], its third conference championship in four years, defeating [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]] in the final.\n\nOf Iowa State's 16 NCAA Tournament appearances, the Cyclones have reached the Sweet Sixteen six times (1944, 1986, 1997, 2000, 2014, 2016), made two appearances in the Elite Eight (1944, 2000), and reached the Final Four once in 1944.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Iowa State Men's Basketball Media Guide\" Iowa State University. 2008. |url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle,dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10700&ATCLID=1608347&KEY=&DB_OEM_ID=10700&DB_LANG=&IN_SUBSCRIBE.html }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Women's basketball ===\n{{main|Iowa State Cyclones women's basketball}}\nIowa State is known for having one of the most successful women's basketball programs in the nation.

astronomique internationale'''}}, '''UAI''') is an [[international]] association of professional [[astronomer]]s, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in [[astronomy]].<ref name=\"IAU-About\" /> Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations and names to [[astronomical object|celestial bodies]] ([[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, etc.) and any surface features on them.<ref name=\"NYT-20140804\" />\n\nThe IAU is a member of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). Its main objective is to promote and safeguard the science of astronomy in all its aspects through international cooperation. The IAU maintains friendly relations with organizations that include [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] in their membership. The IAU has its head office on the second floor of the ''Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris'' in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]].<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100407150225/http://www.iau.org/administration/secretariat/ IAU Secretariat].\" International Astronomical Union.

The IAU is also responsible for the system of astronomical telegrams which are produced and distributed on its behalf by the [[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams]]. The [[Minor Planet Center]] also operates under the IAU, and is a \"clearinghouse\" for all non-planetary or non-moon bodies in the Solar System.<ref name=\"IAU-Centres\" /> The Working Group for Meteor Shower Nomenclature and the Meteor Data Center coordinate the nomenclature of meteor showers.\n\n== History ==\nThe IAU was founded on 28 July 1919, at the Constitutive Assembly of the International Research Council (now [[International Council for Science]]) held in Brussels, Belgium.<ref name=\"IAUhist\" /><ref name=\"hist-Adams\" /> Two subsidiaries of the IAU were also created at this assembly: the ''International Time Commission'' seated at the [[International Time Bureau]] in Paris, France, and the ''International Central Bureau of Astronomical Telegrams'' initially seated in Copenhagen, Denmark.<ref name=\"IAUhist\" /> The 7 initial member states were Belgium, Canada, France, Great Britain, Greece, Japan, and the United States, soon to be followed by Italy and Mexico.<ref name=\"IAUhist\" /> The first executive committee consisted of [[Benjamin Baillaud]] (President, France), [[Alfred Fowler]] (General Secretary, UK), and four vice presidents: [[William Wallace Campbell|William Campbell]] (USA), [[Frank Watson Dyson|Frank Dyson]] (UK), [[Georges Lecointe (explorer)|Georges Lecointe]] (Belgium), and [[Annibale Ricc\u00f2]] (Italy).<ref name=\"IAUhist\" /> Thirty-two Commissions (referred to initially as Standing Committees) were appointed at the Brussels meeting and focused on topics ranging from relativity to minor planets. The reports of these 32 Commissions formed the main substance of the first General Assembly, which took place in Rome, Italy, 2\u201310 May 1922. By the end of the first General Assembly, ten additional nations (Australia, Brazil, Czecho-Slovakia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, South Africa, and Spain) had joined the Union, bringing the total membership to 19 countries. Although the Union was officially formed eight months after the end of World War I, international collaboration in astronomy had been strong in the pre-war era (e.g., the [[Astronomische Gesellschaft Katalog]] projects since 1868, the [[Carte du Ciel|Astrographic Catalogue]] since 1887, and the International Union for Solar research since 1904).<ref name=\"IAUhist\" />\n\nThe first 50 years of the Union's history are well documented.<ref name=\"IAUhist\" /><ref name=\"hist-Adams\" /> Subsequent history is recorded in the form of reminiscences of past IAU Presidents and General Secretaries. Twelve of the fourteen past General Secretaries in the period 1964-2006 contributed their recollections of the Union's history in IAU Information Bulletin No. 100.<ref>[http://www.iau.org/static/publications/IB100-v1.pdf IAU Information Bulletin No. 100, July 2007]</ref> Six past IAU Presidents in the period 1976\u20132003 also contributed their recollections in IAU Information Bulletin No. 104.<ref>[http://www.iau.org/static/publications/IB104.pdf IAU Information Bulletin No. 104, June 2009]</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\nThe IAU includes a total of 12,664 ''individual members'' who are professional astronomers from 96 countries worldwide.<ref>As of 1 February 2017, [http://www.iau.org/administration/membership/individual/distribution/ IAU.org]</ref> 83% of all individual members are male, while 17% are female, among them the union's current president, [[Mexico|Mexican]] astronomer [[Silvia Torres-Peimbert]].\n\nMembership also includes 79 ''national members'', professional astronomical communities representing their country's affiliation with the IAU. National members include the [[Australian Academy of Science]], the Chinese Astronomical Society, the [[French Academy of Sciences]], the [[Indian National Science Academy]], the [[National Academies (United States)]], the [[National Research Foundation of South Africa]], the [[National Scientific and Technical Research Council]] (Argentina), [[KACST]] (Saudi Arabia), the Council of German Observatories, the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] (United Kingdom), the [[Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand]], the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and the [[Science Council of Japan]], among many others.<ref name=\"IAU-National-Members\" />\n\nThe sovereign body of the IAU is its ''General Assembly'', which comprises all members. The Assembly determines IAU policy, approves the Statutes and By-Laws of the Union (and amendments proposed thereto) and elects various committees.\n\nThe right to vote on matters brought before the Assembly varies according to the type of business under discussion. The Statutes consider such business to be divided into two categories:\n\n* '''issues of a \"primarily scientific nature\"''' (as determined by the Executive Committee), upon which voting is restricted to individual members, and\n* '''all other matters''' (such as Statute revision and procedural questions), upon which voting is restricted to the representatives of national members.\n\nOn budget matters (which fall into the second category), votes are weighted according to the relative subscription levels of the national members. A second category vote requires a turnout of at least two-thirds of national members in order to be valid. An absolute majority is sufficient for approval in any vote, except for Statute revision which requires a [[supermajority|two-thirds majority]]. An equality of votes is resolved by the vote of the President of the Union.\n\n[[File:IAU National Members.svg|thumb|center|550px|The IAU includes member organizations from 79 countries (designated as National Members)<ref name=\"IAU-National-Members\" />]]\n\n== General Assemblies ==\nSince 1922, the IAU General Assembly meets every three years, with the exception of the period between 1938 and 1948, due to [[World War II]].\nAfter a Polish request in 1967, and by a controversial decision of the then President of the IAU, an ''Extraordinary IAU General Assembly'' was held in September 1973 in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]],<ref>https://www.iau.org/science/meetings/past/general_assemblies/72/</ref> to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the birth of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], soon after the regular 1973 GA had been held in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align: left;\"\n! width=222 | Meeting\n! width=50 | Year\n!

of astronomy development with governments and scientific academies. The IAU is affiliated with the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), a non-governmental organization representing a global membership that includes both national scientific bodies and international scientific unions.

Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands. The ICC moved into this building in December 2015]]\n\nThe '''International Criminal Court''' ('''ICC''' or '''ICCt''')<ref>International Criminal Court is sometimes abbreviated as ICCt to distinguish it from several other organisations abbreviated as ICC. However the more common abbreviation ICC is used in this article.</ref> is an [[intergovernmental organization]] and [[International court|international tribunal]] that sits in [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The ICC has the [[jurisdiction]] to prosecute individuals for the [[International criminal law|international crimes]] of [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], and [[war crime]]s. The ICC is intended to complement existing national judicial systems and it may therefore only exercise its jurisdiction when certain conditions are met, such as when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals or when the [[United Nations Security Council]] or individual states refer situations to the Court. The ICC began functioning on 1 July 2002, the date that the [[Rome Statute]] entered into force. The Rome Statute is a [[multilateral treaty]] which serves as the ICC's foundational and governing document. States which become party to the Rome Statute, for example by ratifying it, become member states of the ICC. Currently, there are [[States parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|123 states]] which are party to the Rome Statute and therefore members of the ICC.\n\nThe ICC has four principal organs: the Presidency, the Judicial Divisions, the Office of the Prosecutor, and the Registry. The President is the most senior judge chosen by his or her peers in the Judicial Division, which hears cases before the Court. The Office of the Prosecutor is headed by the Prosecutor who investigates crimes and initiates proceedings before the Judicial Division. The Registry is headed by the Registrar and is charged with managing all the administrative functions of the ICC, including the headquarters, detention unit, and public defense office.\n\nThe Office of the Prosecutor has opened ten [[International Criminal Court investigations|official investigations]] and is also conducting an additional eleven preliminary examinations. Thus far, [[List of people indicted in the International Criminal Court|39 individuals]] have been indicted in the ICC, including Ugandan rebel leader [[Joseph Kony]], Sudanese president [[Omar al-Bashir]], Kenyan president [[Uhuru Kenyatta]], Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]], Ivorian president [[Laurent Gbagbo]], and DR Congo vice-president [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]].\n\n== History ==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\nThe establishment of an [[International court|international tribunal]] to judge political leaders accused of international crimes was first proposed during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919 following the [[World War I|First World War]] by the [[Commission of Responsibilities]]. The issue was addressed again at a conference held in [[Geneva]] under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]] in 1937, which resulted in the conclusion of the first convention stipulating the establishment of a permanent international court to try acts of international terrorism. The convention was signed by 13 states, but none ratified it and the convention never entered into force.\n\nFollowing the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[Allies of World War II|allied powers]] established two ''[[ad hoc]]'' tribunals to prosecute [[Axis powers|axis power]] leaders accused of war crimes. The [[Nuremberg trials|International Military Tribunal]], which sat in [[Nuremberg]], prosecuted German leaders while the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] in [[Tokyo]] prosecuted Japanese leaders. In 1948 the [[United Nations General Assembly]] first recognised the need for a permanent international court to deal with atrocities of the kind prosecuted after the Second World War.<ref name=\"iccfact\">United Nations Department of Public Information, December 2002.

From 1996 to 1998, six sessions of the Preparatory Committee were held at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations headquarters]] in [[New York City]], during which NGOs provided input and attended meetings under the umbrella organisation of the Coalition for an ICC (CICC). In January 1998, the Bureau and coordinators of the Preparatory Committee convened for an Inter-Sessional meeting in [[Zutphen]] in the Netherlands to technically consolidate and restructure the draft articles into a draft.\n\nFinally the General Assembly convened a conference in Rome in June 1998, with the aim of finalizing the treaty to serve as the Court's statute.

However, the Rome Statute grants certain powers to the [[United Nations Security Council]], which limits its functional independence. Article 13 allows the Security Council to refer to the Court situations that would not otherwise fall under the Court's jurisdiction (as it did in relation to the situations in Darfur and Libya, which the Court could not otherwise have prosecuted as neither Sudan nor Libya are state parties). Article 16 allows the Security Council to require the Court to defer from investigating a case for a period of 12 months.<ref name=\"Article 16\">Article 16 of the [http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm Rome Statute].

Accessed 23 November 2006.</ref>\n\n===Nongovernmental organizations===\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, international human rights and humanitarian Nongovernmental Organizations (or NGOs) began to proliferate at exponential rates. Concurrently, the quest to find a way to punish international crimes shifted from being the exclusive responsibility of legal experts to being shared with [[international human rights law|international human rights]] activism.\n\nNGOs helped birth the ICC through advocacy and championing for the prosecution of perpetrators of crimes against humanity. NGOs closely monitor the organization's declarations and actions, ensuring that the work that is being executed on behalf of the ICC is fulfilling its objectives and responsibilities to civil society.<ref name=\"Schiff\">{{cite book|last=Schiff|first=Benjamin|title=Building the International Criminal Court|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> According to Benjamin Schiff, \"From the Statute Conference onward, the relationship between the ICC and the NGOs has probably been closer, more consistent, and more vital to the Court than have analogous relations between NGOs and any other international organization.\"\n\nThere are a number of NGOs working on a variety of issues related to the ICC. The NGO [[Coalition for the International Criminal Court]] has served as a sort of umbrella for NGOs to coordinate with each other on similar objectives related to the ICC. The CICC has 2,500 member organizations in 150 different countries.<ref name=\"CICC\">{{cite web|title=About the Coalition|url=http://www.iccnow.org/?mod=coalition|publisher=Coalition for the International Criminal Court}}</ref> The original steering committee included representatives from the [[World Federalist Movement]], the [[International Commission of Jurists]], [[Amnesty International]], the [[Lawyers Committee for Human Rights]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Parliamentarians for Global Action]], and [[No Peace Without Justice]].<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> Today, many of the NGOs with which the ICC cooperates are members of the CICC. These organizations come from a range of backgrounds, spanning from major international NGOs such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], to smaller, more local organizations focused on peace and justice missions.<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> Many work closely with states, such as the International Criminal Law Network, founded and predominantly funded by [[the Hague]] municipality and the Dutch Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs. The CICC also claims organizations that are themselves federations, such as the [[International Federation of Human Rights Leagues]] (FIDH).\n\nCICC members ascribe to three principles that permit them to work under the umbrella of the CICC, so long as their objectives match them:\n*Promoting worldwide ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute of the ICC\n*Maintaining the integrity of the Rome Statute of the ICC, and\n*Ensuring the ICC will be as fair, effective and independent as possible<ref name=\"CICC\"/>\n\nThe NGOs that work under the CICC do not normally pursue agendas exclusive to the work of the Court, rather they may work for broader causes, such as general human rights issues, victims' rights, gender rights, rule of law, conflict mediation, and peace.<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> The CICC coordinates their efforts to improve the efficiency of NGOs' contributions to the Court and to pool their influence on major common issues. From the ICC side, it has been useful to have the CICC channel NGO contacts with the Court so that its officials do not have to interact individually with thousands of separate organizations.\n\nNGOs have been crucial to the evolution of the ICC, as they assisted in the creation of the normative climate that urged states to seriously consider the Court's formation. Their legal experts helped shape the Statute, while their lobbying efforts built support for it. They advocate Statute ratification globally and work at expert and political levels within member states for passage of necessary domestic legislation. NGOs are greatly represented at meetings for the [[#Assembly of States Parties|Assembly of States Parties]], and they use the ASP meetings to press for decisions promoting their priorities.<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> Many of these NGOs have reasonable access to important officials at the ICC because of their involvement during the Statute process. They are engaged in monitoring, commenting upon, and assisting in the ICC's activities.\n\nThe ICC often depends on NGOs to interact with local populations. The Registry Public Information Office personnel and Victims Participation and Reparations Section officials hold seminars for local leaders, professionals and the media to spread the word about the Court.<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> These are the kinds of events that are often hosted or organized by local NGOs. Because there can be challenges with determining which of these NGOs are legitimate, CICC regional representatives often have the ability to help screen and identify trustworthy organizations.\n\nHowever, NGOs are also \"sources of criticism, exhortation and pressure upon\" the ICC.<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> The ICC heavily depends on NGOs for its operations. Although NGOs and states cannot directly impact the judicial nucleus of the organization, they can impart information on crimes, can help locate victims and witnesses, and can promote and organize victim participation. NGOs outwardly comment on the Court's operations, \"push for expansion of its activities especially in the new justice areas of outreach in conflict areas, in victims' participation and reparations, and in upholding due-process standards and defense 'equality of arms' and so implicitly set an agenda for the future evolution of the ICC.\"<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> The relatively uninterrupted progression of NGO involvement with the ICC may mean that NGOs have become repositories of more institutional historical knowledge about the ICC than its national representatives, and have greater expertise than some of the organization's employees themselves. While NGOs look to mold the ICC to satisfy the interests and priorities that they have worked for since the early 1990s, they unavoidably press against the limits imposed upon the ICC by the states that are members of the organization. NGOs can pursue their own mandates, irrespective of whether they are compatible with those of other NGOs, while the ICC must respond to the complexities of its own mandate as well as those of the states and NGOs.\n\nAnother issue has been that NGOs possess \"exaggerated senses of their ownership over the organization and, having been vital to and successful in promoting the Court, were not managing to redefine their roles to permit the Court its necessary independence.\"<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> Additionally, because there does exist such a gap between the large human rights organizations and the smaller peace-oriented organizations, it is difficult for ICC officials to manage and gratify all of their NGOs. \"ICC officials recognize that the NGOs pursue their own agendas, and that they will seek to pressure the ICC in the direction of their own priorities rather than necessarily understanding or being fully sympathetic to the myriad constraints and pressures under which the Court operates.\"<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> Both the ICC and the NGO community avoid criticizing each other publicly or vehemently, although NGOs have released advisory and cautionary messages regarding the ICC. They avoid taking stances that could potentially give the Court's adversaries, particularly the US, more motive to berate the organization.\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n===African Accusations of Western imperialism===\nThe ICC has been accused of bias and as being a tool of Western [[imperialism]], only punishing leaders from small, weak states while ignoring crimes committed by richer and more powerful states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/icc_and_africa.html|title=ICC AND AFRICA - International Criminal Court and African Sovereignty|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref><ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/30/ozatp-africa-icc-idAFJOE70T01R20110130 [[African Union]] accuses ICC prosecutor of bias</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5BcKncSktrUC&pg=PA58&dq=icc+criticism+africa&hl=en&ei=QjHXTrv-Os2aOoOxpbkO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=icc%20criticism%20africa&f=false|title=The European Union's Africa Policies|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37750978 |title= Is this the end for the International Criminal Court? }}</ref> This sentiment has been expressed particularly by African leaders due to an alleged disproportionate focus of the Court on Africa, while it claims to have a global mandate; until January 2016, all nine situations which the ICC had been investigating were in African countries.<ref>Africa and the International Criminal Court: A drag net that catches only small fish?, Nehanda Radio, By William Muchayi, 24 September 2013, http://nehandaradio.com/2013/09/24/africa-and-the-international-criminal-court-a-drag-net-that-catches-only-small-fish/</ref><ref name=\"france24.com\">[http://www.france24.com/en/20120315-lubanga-kony-icc-africans-international-justice-hague-syria-congo Europe - From Lubanga to Kony, is the ICC only after Africans?].

Initially the thorny issue of the actual application of the complementarity principle arose in 2008, when [[William Schabas]] published his monumental paper.<ref>Schabas, W.A., \u2018Complementarity in Practice\u2019: Some Uncomplimentary Thoughts, Crim Law Forum (2008) 19: 5. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10609-007-9054-5</ref> However, despite Schabas' theoretical impact, no substantive research was made by other scholars on this issue for quite some time. In June 2017, Victor Tsilonis advanced the same criticism which is reinforced by events, practices of the Office of the Prosecutor and ICC cases in the [http://crime-in-crisis.com/en/ Essays] in Honour of [[Nestor Courakis]]. His paper essentially argues that the \u0391l\u2010Senussi case arguably is the first instance of the complementarity principle's actual implementation eleven whole years after the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.<ref>[http://crime-in-crisis.com/en/?p=305 Victor Tsilonis, \u201cThe Awakening Hypothesis of the Complementarity Principle\u201d, in C.D.

Strabo says<ref name=\"III.4.19\"/> that the Romans use ''Hispania'' and ''Iberia'' synonymously, distinguishing between the ''near'' northern and the ''far'' southern provinces. (The name \"Iberia\" was ambiguous, being also the name of the [[Kingdom of Iberia]] in the Caucasus.)\n\nWhatever language may generally have been spoken on the peninsula soon gave way to Latin, except for that of the [[Vascones]], which was preserved as a [[language isolate]] by the barrier of the Pyrenees.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Sesars.svg|thumb|Northeast Iberian script from [[Huesca (province)|Huesca]].]]\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula has always been associated with the [[Ebro]], Ib\u0113ros in [[ancient Greek]] and Ib\u0113rus or Hib\u0113rus in [[Latin]]. The association was so well known it was hardly necessary to state; for example, Ib\u0113ria was the country \"this side of the Ib\u0113rus\" in Strabo. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] goes so far as to assert that the Greeks had called \"the whole of Spain\" Hiberia because of the Hiberus River.<ref>III.3.21.</ref> The river appears in the [[Ebro Treaty]] of 226 BC between Rome and Carthage, setting the limit of Carthaginian interest at the Ebro.

Credence in Polybius imposes certain limitations on etymologizing: if the language remains unknown, the meanings of the words, including Iber, must also remain unknown. In modern [[basque language|Basque]], the word ''ibar''<ref name=\"Morris\">[http://www1.euskadi.net/morris/dictionary.htm Morris Student Plus], Basque-English dictionary</ref> means \"valley\" or \"watered meadow\", while ''ibai''<ref name=\"Morris\"/> means \"river\", but there is no proof relating the etymology of the Ebro River with these Basque names.

In Northwestern Iberia (modern Northern Portugal, Asturias and Galicia), a Celtic culture developed, the [[Castro culture]], with a large number of hill forts and some fortified cities.\n\n==Proto-history==\n{{Main article|Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula}}\n\nBy the [[Iron Age]], starting in the 7th century BC, the Iberian Peninsula consisted of complex agrarian and urban civilizations, either [[Pre-Celtic]] or Celtic (such as the [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtiberians]], [[Gallaeci]], [[Astures]], [[Celtici]] and others), the cultures of the Iberians in the eastern and southern zones and the cultures of the [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] in the western portion of the Pyrenees.\n\nThe seafaring Phoenicians, [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] successively settled along the Mediterranean coast and founded trading colonies there over a period of several centuries. Around 1100 BC, Phoenician merchants founded the trading colony of Gadir or Gades (modern day [[C\u00e1diz]]) near [[Tartessos]]. In the 8th century BC, the first [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|Greek colonies]], such as Emporion (modern [[Emp\u00faries]]), were founded along the Mediterranean coast on the east, leaving the south coast to the Phoenicians. The Greeks coined the name Iberia, after the river Iber (Ebro). In the sixth century BC, the Carthaginians arrived in the peninsula while struggling with the Greeks for control of the Western Mediterranean. Their most important colony was Carthago Nova (modern-day [[Cartagena, Spain]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman rule===\n{{Main article|Lusitania|Hispania}}\n[[File:Conquista Hispania.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Roman conquest: 220 BC - 19 BC]]\n\nIn 218 BC, during the [[Second Punic War]] against the Carthaginians, the first [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] troops invaded the Iberian Peninsula; however, it was not until the reign of [[Augustus]] that it was annexed after two centuries of war with the Celtic and Iberian tribes and the Phoenician, Greek and Carthaginian colonies. The result was the creation of the province of [[Hispania]]. It was divided into [[Hispania Ulterior]] and [[Hispania Citerior]] during the late [[Roman Republic]], and during the [[Roman Empire]], it was divided into [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] in the northeast, [[Hispania Baetica]] in the south and [[Lusitania]] in the southwest.\n\nHispania supplied the Roman Empire with silver, food, olive oil, wine, and metal. The emperors [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], and [[Theodosius I]], the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger]], and the poets [[Martial]] and [[Lucan]] were born from families living on the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n===Germanic kingdoms===\n{{Main article|Visigothic Kingdom|Spania}}\n[[File:Hispania 560 AD.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Germanic and Byzantine rule c.560]]\n\nIn the early fifth century, [[Germanic peoples]] invaded the peninsula, namely the [[Suebi]], the [[Vandals]] ([[Silingi]] and [[Hasdingi]]) and their allies, the [[Alans]]. Only the kingdom of the Suebi ([[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]]) would endure after the arrival of another wave of Germanic invaders, the [[Visigoths]], who conquered all of the Iberian Peninsula and expelled or partially integrated the Vandals and the Alans. The Visigoths eventually conquered the Suebi kingdom and its capital city, Bracara (modern day [[Braga]]), in 584\u2013585. They would also conquer the [[Roman province|province]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (552\u2013624) of [[Spania]] in the south of the peninsula and the [[Balearic Islands]].\n\n===Islamic Caliphate===\n{{Main article|Al-Andalus|Islam in Spain|Islam in Portugal}}\n[[File:Al Andalus & Christian Kingdoms.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Islamic rule: [[al-Andalus]] c.1000]]\n\nIn 711, a Muslim army invaded the [[Visigoths|Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania]].

From there, they aimed to reconquer their lands from the Moors; this war of reconquest is known as the [[Reconquista]]. Christian and Muslim kingdoms fought and allied among themselves. The Muslim [[taifa]] kings competed in patronage of the arts, the [[Camino de Santiago]] attracted pilgrims from all Western Europe, and the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jewish population]] set the basis of Sephardi culture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the peninsula housed many small states including the [[Kingdom of Castile]], [[Crown of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre]], [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]. The peninsula was part of the [[Almohad Caliphate]] until it finally uprooted by Castile in the 1230s. The last major Muslim stronghold was [[Granada]], which was conquered by a combined Castilian and Aragonese force in 1492. Muslims and Jews throughout the period were variously tolerated or shown intolerance in different Christian kingdoms. After the [[Granada War#Last stand at Granada|fall of Granada]], all Muslims and Jews were ordered to convert to Christianity or face expulsion. Many Jews and Muslims fled to [[North Africa]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while others publicly converted to Christianity and became known respectively as [[Marrano]]s and [[Morisco]]s. However, many of these continued to practice their religion in secret. The Moriscos revolted several times and were ultimately [[expulsion of the Moriscos|forcibly expelled]] from Spain in the early 17th century.\n\n[[File:Carte historique des Royaumes d'Espagne et Portugal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Map of Spain and Portugal, ''Atlas historique'', dated approximately 1705\u20131739, of H.A.

World-class [[mineral deposit]]s can also be found there. The core of the Iberian Peninsula consists of a [[Hercynian]] [[craton]]ic block known as the [[Iberian Massif]]. On the northeast, this is bounded by the Pyrenean fold belt, and on the southeast it is bounded by the [[Baetic System]]. These twofold chains are part of the [[Geology of the Alps|Alpine belt]]. To the west, the peninsula is delimited by the continental boundary formed by the [[magma]]-poor opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Hercynian Foldbelt is mostly buried by Mesozoic and Tertiary cover rocks to the east, but nevertheless outcrops through the [[Sistema Ib\u00e9rico]] and the [[Catalan Mediterranean System]].\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main article|Climate of Portugal|Climate of Spain}}\nThe Iberian peninsula has two dominant climate types. One of these is the [[oceanic climate]] seen in the Atlantic coastal region resulting in evenly temperatures with relatively cool summers. However, most of Portugal and Spain have a [[mediterranean climate]] with various precipitation and temperatures depending on latitude and position versus the sea. There are also more localized [[semi-arid climate]]s in central Spain, with temperatures resembling a more continental mediterranean climate. In other extreme cases highland alpine climates such as in [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] and areas with extremely low precitipation and [[desert climate]]s or [[semi-arid climate]]s such as the [[Almer\u00eda]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=6325O&k=and|title=Standard climate values for Almer\u00eda|publisher=Aemet.es|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref> area, [[Murcia]] area and southern [[Alicante]] area.

Then there exists at least one ''x'' with ''f''(''x'') = ''s'']]\nIn [[mathematical analysis]], the '''intermediate value theorem''' states that if a [[continuous function]], ''f'', with an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], [''a'', ''b''], as its [[domain of a function|domain]], takes values ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') at each end of the interval, then it also takes any value between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') at some point within the interval.\n\nThis has two important [[corollary|corollaries]]: \n\n# If a continuous function has values of opposite sign inside an interval, then it has a root in that interval ('''Bolzano's theorem''').<ref>{{MathWorld |title=Bolzano's Theorem |urlname=BolzanosTheorem}}</ref> \n# The [[image (mathematics)|image]] of a continuous function over an interval is itself an interval.\n\n==Motivation==\n[[Image:Intermediatevaluetheorem.svg|thumb|280px|The intermediate value theorem]]\n\nThis captures an intuitive property of continuous functions: given ''f'' continuous on [1, 2] with the known values ''f''(1) = 3 and ''f''(2) = 5. Then the graph of ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') must pass through the horizontal line ''y'' = 4 while ''x'' moves from 1 to 2. It represents the idea that the graph of a continuous function on a closed interval can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper.\n\n==Theorem==\nThe intermediate value theorem states the following.\n\nConsider an interval <math>I=[a,b]</math> in the [[real number]]s <math>\\R</math> and a continuous function <math>f:I\\to\\R</math>. Then,\n\n*''Version I.'' if <math>u</math> is a number between <math>f(a)</math> and <math>f(b)</math>,\n::that is, <math>\\min(f(a),f(b))<u<\\max(f(a),f(b))</math>,\n:then there is a <math>c\\in (a,b)</math> such that <math>f(c)=u</math>.\n\n*''Version II.'' the image set <math>f(I)</math> is also an interval, and either it contains <math>\\bigl[f(a),f(b)\\bigr]</math>, or it contains <math>\\bigl[f(b),f(a)\\bigr]</math>; that is,\n::<math>f(I)\\supseteq\\bigl[f(a),f(b)\\bigr]\\ \\mbox{ or }\\ f(I)\\supseteq\\bigl[f(b),f(a)\\bigr]</math>.\n\n'''Remark:''' ''Version II'' states that the set of function values has no gap. For any two function values <math>c<d</math>, even if they are outside the interval between <math>f(a)</math> and <math>f(b)</math>, all points in the interval <math>\\bigl[c,d\\bigr]</math> are also function values,\n::<math>\\bigl[c,d\\bigr]\\subseteq f(I)</math>.\nA subset of the real numbers with no internal gap is an interval. ''Version I'' is naturally contained in ''Version II''.\n\n==Relation to completeness==\nThe theorem depends on, and is equivalent to, the [[completeness of the real numbers]]. The intermediate value theorem does not apply to the [[rational number]]s \u211a because gaps exist between rational numbers; [[irrational numbers]] fill those gaps. For example, the function <math>f(x)=x^2-2</math> for <math>x\\in\\Q</math> satisfies <math>f(0)=-2</math> and <math>f(2)=2</math>. However, there is no rational number <math>x</math> such that <math>f(x)=0</math>, because <math>\\sqrt2</math> is an irrational number.\n\n==Proof==<!-- This section is linked from [[Continuity property]] -->\nThe theorem may be proven as a consequence of the [[completeness (order theory)|completeness]] property of the real numbers as follows:<ref>Essentially follows {{cite book |title=Foundations of Analysis|first=Douglas A.|last=Clarke|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|year=1971|page=284}}</ref>\n\nWe shall prove the first case, <math>f(a)<u<f(b)</math>. The second case is similar.\n\nLet <math>S</math> be the set of all <math>x\\in[a,b]</math> such that <math>f(x)\\leq u</math>. Then <math>S</math> is non-empty since <math>a</math> is an element of <math>S</math>, and <math>S</math> is bounded above by <math>b</math>. Hence, by completeness, the [[supremum]] <math>c=\\sup S</math> exists. That is, <math>c</math> is the lowest number that is greater than or equal to every member of <math>S</math>. We claim that <math>f(c)=u</math>.\n\nFix some <math>\\varepsilon>0</math>. Since <math>f</math> is continuous, there is a <math>\\delta>0</math> such that <math>\\Big|f(x)-f(c)\\Big|<\\varepsilon</math> whenever <math>|x-c|<\\delta</math>. This means that\n::<math>f(x)-\\varepsilon<f(c)<f(x)+\\varepsilon</math>\nfor all <math>x\\in(c-\\delta,c+\\delta)</math>. By the properties of the supremum, there exist <math>a^*\\in (c-\\delta,c]</math> that is contained in <math>S</math>, so that for that <math>a^*</math>\n::<math>f(c)<f(a^*)+\\varepsilon\\le u+\\varepsilon</math>.\nChoose <math>a^{**}\\in[c,c+\\delta)</math> that will obviously not be contained in <math>S</math>, so we have\n::<math>f(c)>f(a^{**})-\\varepsilon\\ge u-\\varepsilon</math>.\nBoth inequalities\n::<math>u-\\varepsilon<f(c)<u+\\varepsilon</math>\nare valid for all <math>\\varepsilon>0</math>, from which we deduce <math>f(c)=u</math> as the only possible value, as stated.\n\nThe intermediate value theorem is an easy consequence of the basic properties of connected sets: the preservation of connectedness under continuous functions and the characterization of connected subsets of \u211d as intervals (''see below for details'' ''and alternate proof'')''.''  The latter characterization is ultimately a consequence of the least-upper-bound property of the real numbers.\n\nThe intermediate value theorem can also be proved using the methods of [[non-standard analysis]], which places \"intuitive\" arguments involving infinitesimals on a rigorous footing.  (''See the article:'' [[non-standard calculus]].)\n\n==History==\nFor ''u'' = 0 above, the statement is also known as ''Bolzano's theorem.'' This theorem was first proved by [[Bernard Bolzano]] in 1817. [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] provided a proof in 1821.<ref name=\"grabiner\">{{Cite journal\n|title=Who Gave You the Epsilon?

The idea that continuous functions possess the intermediate value property has an earlier origin. [[Simon Stevin]] proved the intermediate value theorem for polynomials (using a cubic as an example) by providing an algorithm for constructing the decimal expansion of the solution.  The algorithm iteratively subdivides the interval into 10 parts, producing an additional decimal digit at each step of the iteration.<ref>Karin Usadi Katz and [[Mikhail Katz|Mikhail G. Katz]] (2011) A Burgessian Critique of Nominalistic Tendencies in Contemporary Mathematics and its Historiography. [[Foundations of Science]]. {{doi|10.1007/s10699-011-9223-1}} See [http://www.springerlink.com/content/tj7j2810n8223p43/ link]</ref> Before the formal definition of continuity was given, the intermediate value property was given as part of the definition of a continuous function. Proponents include [[Louis Arbogast]], who assumed the functions to have no jumps, satisfy the intermediate value property and have increments whose sizes corresponded to the sizes of the increments of the variable.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Arbogast}}</ref>\nEarlier authors held the result to be intuitively obvious and requiring no proof.  The insight of Bolzano and Cauchy was to define a general notion of continuity (in terms of [[infinitesimal]]s in Cauchy's case and using real inequalities in Bolzano's case), and to provide a proof based on such definitions.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\nThe intermediate value theorem is closely linked to the topological notion of [[Connectedness (topology)|connectedness]] and follows from the basic properties of connected sets in metric spaces and connected subsets of \u211d in particular:\n* If <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are [[metric space]]s, <math>f:X\\to Y</math> is a continuous map, and <math>E\\subset X</math> is a [[Connected space|connected]] subset, then <math>f(E)</math> is connected. (*)\n* A subset <math>E\\subset\\mathbb{R}</math> is connected if and only if it satisfies the following property: <math>x,y\\in E,\\ x<r<y \\implies r\\in E</math>. (**)\n\nIn fact, connectedness is a [[topological property]] and (*) generalizes to topological spaces: ''If <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are [[topological space]]s, <math>f:X\\to Y</math> is a continuous map, and <math>X</math> is a [[connected space]], then <math>f(X)</math> is connected.''  The preservation of connectedness under continuous maps can be thought of as a generalization of the intermediate value theorem, a property of real valued functions of a real variable, to continuous functions in general spaces.\n\nRecall the first version of the intermediate value theorem, stated previously:\n\n'''Intermediate value theorem.''' ''(Version I). Consider a closed interval <math>I=[a,b]</math> in the real numbers <math>\\R</math> and a continuous function <math>f:I\\to\\R</math>. Then, if <math> u</math> is a real number such that <math>\\min(f(a),f(b))< u < \\max(f(a),f(b))</math>, there exists <math>c\\in(a,b)</math> such that <math>f(c)=u</math>.''\n\nThe intermediate value theorem is an immediate consequence of these two properties of connectedness:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-054235-8|location=New York|pages=42, 93|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n'''''Proof:''''' By (**), <math>I=[a,b]</math> is a connected set.  It follows from  (*) that the image, <math>f(I)</math>, is also connected.  For convenience, assume that <math>f(a)<f(b)</math>.  Then once more invoking (**), <math>f(a)<u<f(b)</math> implies that <math>u\\in f(I)</math>, or <math>f(c)=u</math> for some <math>c\\in I</math>.  Since <math>u\\neq f(a), f(b)</math>, <math>c\\in(a,b)</math> must actually hold, and the desired conclusion follows.  The same argument applies if <math>f(b)<f(a)</math>, so we are done.<math>\\ \\ \\blacksquare</math>\n\nThe intermediate value theorem generalizes in a natural way: Suppose that ''X'' is a connected topological space and (''Y'', <) is a [[total order|totally ordered]] set equipped with the [[order topology]], and let ''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' be a continuous map. If ''a'' and ''b'' are two points in ''X'' and ''u'' is a point in ''Y'' lying between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') with respect to <, then there exists ''c'' in ''X'' such that ''f''(''c'') = ''u''.  The original theorem is recovered by noting that \u211d is connected and that its natural topology is the order topology.\n\nThe [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] is a related theorem that, [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem#One-dimensional case|in one dimension]] gives a special case of the intermediate value theorem.\n\n==Converse is false==\n\nA \"[[Darboux function]]\" is a real-valued function ''f'' that has the \"intermediate value property\", i.e., that satisfies the conclusion of the intermediate value theorem: for any two values ''a'' and ''b'' in the domain of ''f'', and any ''y'' between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b''), there is some ''c'' between ''a'' and ''b'' with ''f''(''c'') = ''y''.  The intermediate value theorem says that every continuous function is a Darboux function.  However, not every Darboux function is continuous; i.e., the converse of the intermediate value theorem is false.\n\nAs an example, take the function ''f'' : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [&minus;1, 1] defined by ''f''(''x'') = sin(1/''x'') for ''x'' > 0 and f(0) = 0. This function is not continuous at ''x'' = 0 because the [[limit of a function|limit]] of ''f''(''x'') as ''x'' tends to 0 does not exist; yet the function has the intermediate value property.  Another, more complicated example is given by the [[Conway base 13 function]].\n\nHistorically, this intermediate value property has been suggested as a ''definition'' for continuity of real-valued functions<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lnuhDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=Historically,+this+intermediate+value+property+has+been+suggested+as+a+definition+for+continuity+of+real-valued+functions&source=bl&ots=77BNBThFH6&sig=ldlleSGvtuqqcrLcX5D_YIon-gg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdksmEo97YAhXFTbwKHaJ-Aa8Q6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&q=Historically,%20this%20intermediate%20value%20property%20has%20been%20suggested%20as%20a%20definition%20for%20continuity%20of%20real-valued%20functions&f=false|title=MVT: A Most Valuable Theorem|last=Smorynski|first=Craig|date=2017-04-07|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319529561|language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}; this definition was not adopted.\n\n[[Darboux's theorem (analysis)|Darboux's theorem]] states that all functions that result from the [[derivative|differentiation]] of some other function on some interval have the [[intermediate value property]] (even though they need not be continuous).\n\n==Practical applications==\n\nThe theorem implies that on any [[great circle]] around the world, for the [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[elevation]], [[carbon dioxide]] concentration, if the [[Quantum#Beyond_electromagnetic_radiation|simplification]] is taken that this varies continuously, there will always exist two [[antipodal points]] that share the same value for that variable.\n\n''Proof:'' Take ''f'' to be any continuous function on a circle. Draw a line through the center of the circle, intersecting it at two opposite points ''A'' and ''B''. Let ''d'' be defined by the difference ''f''(''A'') &minus; ''f''(''B''). If the line is rotated 180 degrees, the value &minus;''d'' will be obtained instead. Due to the intermediate value theorem there must be some intermediate rotation angle for which ''d'' = 0, and as a consequence ''f''(''A'') = ''f''(''B'') at this angle.\n\nThis is a special case of a more general result called the [[Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem]].\n\nAnother generalization for which this holds is for any closed convex n (n > 1) dimensional shape. Specifically, for any continuous function whose domain is the given shape, and any point inside the shape (not necessarily its center), there exist two antipodal points with respect to the given point whose functional value is the same.

They were also active after the failed U.S. attempt to rescue [[Iran hostage crisis|its hostages]], [[Operation Eagle Claw]].

Iran repudiated the demarcation line established in the [[Constantinople]] Protocol of November 1913. Iran asked the border to run along the [[thalweg]], the deepest point of the navigable channel. Iraq encouraged by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] took Iran to the League of Nations in 1934, but their disagreement was not resolved. Finally in 1937 Iran and Iraq signed their first boundary treaty. The treaty established the waterway border on the eastern bank of the river except for a four-mile anchorage zone near Abadan, which was allotted to Iran and where the border ran along the thalweg. Iran sent a delegation to Iraq soon after the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba\u2019th coup]] in 1969 and, when Iraq refused to proceed with negotiations over a new treaty, the treaty of 1937 was withdrawn by Iran. But five years later, on 17 September 1980, Iraq suddenly abrogated the Algiers Protocol following the Iranian revolution. [[Saddam Hussein]] claimed that the Islamic Republic of Iran refused to abide by the stipulations of the Algiers Protocol and, therefore, Iraq considered the Protocol null and void.

Iraq's strategy changed from holding territory in Iran to denying Iran any major gains in Iraq (as well as holding onto disputed territories and Iran's border areas).<ref name=iranchamber-iraniraqwar /> Saddam commenced a policy of [[total war]], gearing most of his country towards defending against Iran.

By the end of 1982, Iraq had been resupplied with new Soviet and Chinese materiel, and the ground war entered a new phase. Iraq used newly acquired T-55, T-62 and T-72 tanks (as well as Chinese copies), [[BM 21|BM-21]] truck-mounted rocket launchers, and [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24]] helicopter gunships to prepare a Soviet-type three-line defence, replete with obstacles such as barbed wire, minefields, fortified positions and bunkers. The Combat Engineer Corps built bridges across water obstacles, laid minefields, erected earthen revetments, dug trenches, built machinegun nests, and prepared new defence lines and fortifications.<ref name=iranchamber-iraniraqwar />{{rp|2|date=November 2012}}\n\nIraq began to focus on using [[defense in depth]] to defeat the Iranians.<ref name=pollack04 /> Iraq created multiple static defense lines to bleed the Iranians through sheer size.<ref name=pollack04 /> When faced against large Iranian attack, where human waves would overrun Iraq's entrenched infantry defences, the Iraqis would often retreat, but their [[static defense|static defences]] would bleed the Iranians and channel them into certain directions, drawing them into traps or pockets. Iraqi air and artillery attacks would then pin the Iranians down, while tanks and mechanised infantry attacks using mobile warfare would push them back.<ref name=williams02 /> Sometimes, the Iraqis would launch \"probing attacks\" into the Iranian lines to provoke them into launching their attacks sooner. While Iranian human wave attacks were successful against the dug in Iraqi forces in Khuzestan, they had trouble breaking through Iraq's defense in depth lines.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> Iraq had a logistical advantage in their defence: the front was located near the main Iraqi bases and arms depots, allowing their army to be efficiently supplied.<ref name=brogan89 />{{rp|260,265|date=November 2012}} By contrast, the front in Iran was a considerable distance away from the main Iranian bases and arms depots, and as such, Iranian troops and supplies had to travel through mountain ranges before arriving at the front.<ref name=brogan89 />{{rp|260|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn addition, Iran's military power was weakened once again by large purges in 1982, resulting from another supposedly attempted coup.<ref name=\"Dunn 1998\" />\n\n=====Operation Ramadan (First Battle of Basra)=====\n{{Main|Operation Ramadan}}\nThe Iranian generals wanted to launch an all-out attack on Baghdad and seize it before the weapon shortages continued to manifest further.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards also used the T-55 tanks they had captured in earlier battles.<ref name=pollack04 />\n\nHowever, the attacks came to a halt and the Iranians turned to defensive measures. Seeing this, Iraq used their [[Mi-25]] helicopters, along with [[Gazelle helicopter]]s armed with [[Euromissile HOT]], against columns of Iranian mechanised infantry and tanks. These \"hunter-killer\" teams of helicopters, which had been formed with the help of [[East Germany|East German]] advisors, proved to be very costly for Iranians.

However, only {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Basra, the poorly equipped Iranian forces were surrounded on three sides by Iraqis with heavy weaponry. Some were captured, while many were killed. Only a last-minute attack by Iranian AH-1 Cobra helicopters stopped the Iraqis from [[rout]]ing the Iranians.<ref name=\"cooper03_214\" /> Three more similar attacks occurred around the Khorramshar-Baghdad road area towards the end of the month, but none were significantly successful.<ref name=pollack04 /> Iraq had concentrated three armoured divisions, the 3rd, 9th, and 10th, as a counter-attack force to attack any penetrations. They were successful in defeating the Iranian breakthroughs, but suffered heavy losses. The 9th Armoured Division in particular had to be disbanded, and was never reformed. The total casualty toll had grown to include 80,000 soldiers and civilians. 400 Iranian tanks and armored vehicles were destroyed or abandoned, while Iraq lost no fewer than 370 tanks.<ref>O'Ballance, E.

During [[Operation Dawn (1983)|Operation Dawn-1]], in early February 1983, 50,000 Iranian forces attacked westward from Dezful and were confronted by 55,000 Iraqi forces. The Iranian objective was to cut off the road from Basra to Baghdad in the central sector. The Iraqis carried out 150 air sorties against the Iranians, and even bombed Dezful, Ahvaz, and Khorramshahr in retribution.

Iran saw an opportunity to sweep away Iraqi forces controlling the roads between the Iranian mountain border towns of Mehran, [[Dehloran]] and [[Elam]]. Iraq launched airstrikes, and equipped attack helicopters with chemical [[warhead]]s; while ineffective, it demonstrated both the Iraqi general staff's and Saddam's increasing interest in using chemical weapons.

Three Iranian regular divisions, the Revolutionary Guard, and [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]] (KDP) elements amassed in [[Marivan]] and [[Sardasht, West Azerbaijan|Sardasht]] in a move to threaten the major Iraqi city [[Suleimaniyah]]. Iran's strategy was to press Kurdish tribes to occupy the Banjuin Valley, which was within {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} of Suleimaniyah and {{convert|140|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the oilfields of [[Kirkuk]]. To stem the tide, Iraq deployed [[Mi-8]] attack helicopters equipped with chemical weapons and executed 120 sorties against the Iranian force, which stopped them {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} into Iraqi territory. 5,000 Iranians and 2,500 Iraqis died.<ref name=\"aboulenein12_dawn3\" /> Iran gained {{convert|110|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of its territory back in the north, gained {{convert|15|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of Iraqi land, and captured 1,800 Iraqi prisoners while Iraq abandoned large quantities of valuable weapons and war [[materiel]] in the field. Iraq responded to these losses by firing a series of SCUD-B missiles into the cities of Dezful, [[Masjid Soleiman]], and [[Behbehan]]. Iran's use of artillery against Basra while the battles in the north raged created multiple fronts, which effectively confused and wore down Iraq.<ref name=\"aboulenein12_dawn3\" />\n\n====Iran's change in tactics====\n[[File:Children In iraq-iran war3.jpg|thumb|Iranian child soldier.]]\nPreviously, the Iranians had outnumbered the Iraqis on the battlefield, but Iraq expanded their [[military draft]] (pursuing a policy of total war), and by 1984, the armies were equal in size. By 1986, Iraq had twice as many soldiers as Iran. By 1988, Iraq would have 1 million soldiers, giving it the fourth largest army in the world. Some of their equipment, such as tanks, outnumbered the Iranians' by at least five to one.

Iraq repeatedly bombed Iran's main oil export facility on Kharg Island, causing increasingly heavy damage. As a first response to these attacks, Iran attacked a Kuwaiti tanker carrying Iraqi oil near [[Bahrain]] on 13 May 1984, as well as a Saudi tanker in Saudi waters on 16 May.

The Iraqi Air Force reacted by increasing the sophistication of its equipment, incorporating modern [[electronic countermeasure]] pods, decoys such as [[chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]] and [[flare]], and [[anti-radiation missile]]s.<ref name=cooper03_205 /> Due to the heavy losses in the last war of the cities, Iraq reduced their use of aerial attacks on Iranian cities. Instead, they would launch Scud missiles, which the Iranians could not stop. Since the range of the Scud missile was too short to reach Tehran, they converted them to [[Al Hussein (missile)|al-Hussein missiles]] with the help of East German engineers, cutting up their Scuds into three chunks and attaching them together. Iran responded to these attacks by using their own Scud missiles.<ref name=mashregnews />\n\nAside from extensive foreign help to Iraq, Iranian attacks were severely hampered by their shortages of weaponry, including heavy weaponry. Large portions of them had been lost during the last several years. Iran still managed to maintain 1,000 tanks (often by capturing Iraqi ones) and additional artillery, but many needed repairs to be operational. But by this time Iran managed to procure spare parts from various sources, helping them to restore some weapons. They secretly imported some weapons, such as [[RBS-70]] anti-aircraft [[MANPADS]].<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> In an exception to the United States' support for Iraq, in exchange for Iran using its influence to help free western hostages in [[Lebanon]], the United States secretly sold Iran some limited supplies (in Ayatollah Rafsanjani's postwar interview, he stated that during the period when Iran was succeeding, for a short time the United States supported Iran, then shortly after began helping Iraq again).<ref name=Viewpoints /> Iran managed to get some advanced weapons, such as anti-tank [[TOW missile]]s, which worked better than [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s. Iran later [[reverse-engineered]] and produced those weapons on their own as well.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /><ref name=\"Cordesman VII\" /> All of these almost certainly helped increase the effectiveness of Iran, although it did not reduce the human cost of their attacks.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /><ref name=\"Cordesman VII\" />\n\n====First Battle of al-Faw====\n{{Main|First Battle of al-Faw|Operation Dawn 8}}\nOn the night of 10\u201311 February 1986, the Iranians launched Operation Dawn 8,<ref name=Pollack_217>{{cite book|last=Pollack|first=Kenneth, M|title=The Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948\u20131991|year=2002|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=0-8032-3733-2|page=217}}</ref> in which 30,000 troops comprising five Army divisions and men from the Revolutionary Guard and Basij advanced in a two-pronged offensive to capture the [[al-Faw peninsula]] in southern Iraq, the only area touching the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref name=efraimkarsh /> The capture of Al Faw and Umm Qasr was a major goal for Iran.<ref name=Viewpoints /> Iran began with a feint attack against Basra, which was stopped by the Iraqis;<ref name=efraimkarsh /><ref name=csis8 /> Meanwhile, an amphibious strike force landed at the foot of the peninsula. The resistance, consisting of several thousand poorly trained soldiers of the [[Iraqi Popular Army]], fled or were defeated, and the Iranian forces set up pontoon bridges crossing the Shatt al-Arab,<ref name=waterway group=note /> allowing 30,000 soldiers to cross in a short period of time.<ref name=csis8 /> They drove north along the peninsula almost unopposed, capturing it after only 24 hours of fighting.<ref name=efraimkarsh /><ref name=bulloch89 />{{rp|240|date=November 2012}}<ref name=pollack04 /> Afterwards they dug in and set up defenses.<ref name=pollack04 />\n\nThe sudden capture of al-Faw took the Iraqis by shock, since they had thought it impossible for the Iranians to cross the Shatt al-Arab. On 12 February 1986, the Iraqis began a counter-offensive to retake al-Faw, which failed after a week of heavy fighting.<ref name=efraimkarsh /><ref name=pollack04 /> On 24 February 1986, Saddam sent one of his best commanders, General [[Maher Abd al-Rashid]], and the [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] to begin a new offensive to recapture al-Faw.<ref name=efraimkarsh /> A new round of heavy fighting took place. However, their attempts again ended in failure, costing them many tanks and aircraft:<ref name=efraimkarsh /> their 15th mechanised division was almost completely wiped out.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> The capture of al-Faw and the failure of the Iraqi counter-offensives were blows to the Ba'ath regime's prestige, and led the Gulf countries to fear that Iran might win the war.<ref name=efraimkarsh /> Kuwait in particular felt menaced with Iranian troops only {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, and increased its support of Iraq accordingly.<ref name=bulloch89 />{{rp|241|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn March 1986, the Iranians tried to follow up their success by attempting to take [[Umm Qasr]], which would have completely severed Iraq from the Gulf and placed Iranian troops on the border with Kuwait.<ref name=efraimkarsh /><ref name=Viewpoints /> However, the offensive failed due to Iranian shortages of armor.<ref name=efraimkarsh /> By this time, 17,000 Iraqis and 30,000 Iranians were made casualties.<ref name=efraimkarsh /> The First Battle of al-Faw ended in March, but heavy combat operations lasted on the peninsula into 1988, with neither side being able to displace the other. The battle bogged down into a World War I-style [[stalemate]] in the marshes of the peninsula.<ref name=\"Woods 2010\" />\n\n====Battle of Mehran====\n{{Main|Battle of Mehran}}\nImmediately after the Iranian capture of al-Faw, Saddam declared a new offensive against Iran, designed to drive deep into the state.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> The Iranian border city of [[Mehran, Ilam|Mehran]], on the foot of the Zagros Mountains, was selected as the first target. On 15\u201319 May, Iraqi Army's Second Corps, supported by helicopter gunships, attacked and captured the city. Saddam then offered the Iranians to exchange Mehran for al-Faw.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> The Iranians rejected the offer. Iraq then continued the attack, attempting to push deeper into Iran. However, Iraq's attack was quickly warded off by Iranian AH-1 Cobra helicopters with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]] missiles, which destroyed numerous Iraqi tanks and vehicles.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" />\n\nThe Iranians built up their forces on the heights surrounding Mehran. On 30 June, using mountain warfare tactics they launched their attack, recapturing the city by 3 July.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> Saddam ordered the Republican Guard to retake the city on 4 July, but their attack was ineffective. Iraqi losses were heavy enough to allow the Iranians to also capture territory inside Iraq,<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> and depleted the Iraqi military enough to prevent them from launching a major offensive for the next two years.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> Iraq's defeats at al-Faw and at Mehran were severe blows to the prestige of the Iraqi regime, and western powers, including the US, became more determined to prevent an Iraqi loss.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" />\n\n====Strategic situation at the end of 1986====\nThrough the eyes of international observers, Iran was prevailing in the war by the end of 1986.<ref name=csis8 /> In the northern front, the Iranians began launching attacks toward the city of [[Suleimaniya]] with the help of Kurdish fighters, taking the Iraqis by surprise. They came within {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the city before being stopped by chemical and army attacks. Iran's army had also reached the Meimak Hills, only {{convert|113|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Baghdad.<ref name=csis8 /> Iraq managed to contain Iran's offensives in the south, but was under serious pressure, as the Iranians were slowly overwhelming them.\n\nIraq responded by launching another \"war of the cities\". In one attack, Tehran's main oil refinery was hit, and in another instance, Iraq damaged Iran's Assadabad satellite dish, disrupting Iranian overseas telephone and [[telex]] service for almost two weeks.<ref name=csis8 /> Civilian areas were also hit, resulting in many casualties. Iraq continued to attack oil tankers via air.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> Iran responded by launching Scud missiles and air attacks at Iraqi targets.\n\nIraq continued to attack Kharg Island and the oil tankers and facilities as well. Iran created a tanker [[public transport|shuttle]] service of 20 tankers to move oil from Kharg to Larak Island, escorted by Iranian fighter jets. Once moved to Larak, the oil would be moved to oceangoing tankers (usually neutral).<ref name=\"Cordesman IX\" /> They also rebuilt the oil terminals damaged by Iraqi air raids and moved shipping to Larak Island, while attacking foreign tankers that carried Iraqi oil (as Iran had blocked Iraq's access to the open sea with the capture of al-Faw). By now they almost always used the armed speedboats of the IRGC navy, and attacked many tankers.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> The tanker war escalated drastically, with attacks nearly doubling in 1986 (the majority carried out by Iraq). Iraq got permission from the Saudi government to use its airspace to attack Larak Island, although due to the distance attacks were less frequent there. The escalating tanker war in the Gulf became an ever-increasing concern to foreign powers, especially the United States.<ref name=\"Cordesman IX\" />\n\nIn April 1986, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a [[fatwa]] declaring that the war must be won by March 1987. The Iranians increased recruitment efforts, obtaining 650,000 volunteers.<ref name=aboulenein12_dawn3 /> The animosity between the Army and the Revolutionary Guard arose again, with the Army wanting to use more refined, limited military attacks while the Revolutionary Guard wanted to carry out major offensives.<ref name=aboulenein12_dawn3 /> Iran, confident in its successes, began planning their largest offensives of the war, which they called their \"final offensives.\"<ref name=aboulenein12_dawn3 />\n\n=====Iraq's dynamic defense strategy=====\nFaced with their recent defeats in al-Faw and Mehran, Iraq appeared to be losing the war. Iraq's generals, angered by Saddam's interference, threatened a full-scale mutiny against the Ba'ath Party unless they were allowed to conduct operations freely. In one of the few times during his career, Saddam gave in to the demands of his generals.<ref name=pollack04 /> Up to this point, Iraqi strategy was to ride out Iranian attacks. However, the defeat at al-Faw led Saddam to declare the war to be ''Al-Defa al-Mutaharakha'' (The Dynamic Defense),<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> and announcing that all civilians had to take part in the war effort. The universities were closed and all of the male students were drafted into the military. Civilians were instructed to clear marshlands to prevent Iranian amphibious infiltrations and to help build fixed defenses.\n\nThe government tried to integrate the Shias into the war effort by recruiting many as part of the Ba'ath Party.<ref name=pollack04 /> In an attempt to counterbalance the religious fervor of the Iranians and gain support from the devout masses, the regime also began to promote religion and, on the surface, [[Islamization]], despite the fact that Iraq was run by a secular regime. Scenes of Saddam praying and making pilgrimages to shrines became common on state-run television. While Iraqi morale had been low throughout the war, the attack on al-Faw raised patriotic fervor, as the Iraqis feared invasion.<ref name=pollack04 /> Saddam also recruited volunteers from other Arab countries into the Republican Guard, and received much technical support from foreign nations as well.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> While Iraqi military power had been depleted in recent battles, through heavy foreign purchases and support, they were able to expand their military even to much larger proportions by 1988.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" />\n\nAt the same time, Saddam ordered the genocidal [[al-Anfal Campaign]] in an attempt to crush the Kurdish resistance, who were now allied with Iran. The result was the deaths of several hundred thousand Iraqi Kurds, and the destruction of villages, towns, and cities.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rubin, Michael|title=Are Kurds a pariah minority?|journal=Social Research|date=Spring 2003|volume=70|issue=1|pages=295\u2013330|publisher=The New School|series=Pariah Minorities|jstor=40971614}}</ref>\n\nIraq began to try to perfect its maneuver tactics.<ref name=pollack04 /> The Iraqis began to prioritize the professionalization of their military. Prior to 1986, the [[conscription]]-based Iraqi regular army and the volunteer-based Iraqi Popular Army conducted the bulk of the operations in the war, to little effect. The Republican Guard, formerly an elite [[praetorian guard]], was expanded as a volunteer army and filled with Iraq's best generals.<ref name=pollack04 /> Loyalty to the state was no longer a primary requisite for joining. However, due to Saddam's paranoia, the former duties of the Republican Guard were transferred to a new unit, the [[Special Republican Guard]].<ref name=pollack04 /> Full-scale war games against hypothetical Iranian positions were carried out in the western Iraqi desert against mock targets, and they were repeated over the course of a full year until the forces involved fully memorized their attacks.<ref name=pollack04 /> Iraq built its military massively, eventually possessing the 4th largest in the world, in order to overwhelm the Iranians through sheer size.<ref name=pollack04 />\n\n===1987\u201388: Towards a ceasefire===\n\n[[File:Mersad.jpg|thumb|The [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]], supported by Saddam, started a ten-day operation after both the Iranian and Iraqi governments accepted UN Resolution 598. Casualty estimates range from 2,000 to 10,000.]]\nMeanwhile, as the Iraqis were planning their strike, the Iranians continued to attack. 1987 saw a renewed series of major Iranian human wave offensives in both northern and southern Iraq. The Iraqis had elaborately fortified Basra with 5 defensive rings, exploiting natural waterways such as the Shatt-al-Arab and artificial ones, such as ''Fish Lake'' and the Jasim River, along with earth barriers. Fish Lake was a massive lake filled with mines, underwater barbed wire, [[electrode]]s and sensors. Behind each waterway and defensive line was radar-guided artillery, [[ground attack aircraft]] and helicopters; all capable of firing poison gas or conventional munitions.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" />\n\nThe Iranian strategy was to penetrate the Iraqi defences and encircle Basra, cutting off the city as well as the Al-Faw peninsula from the rest of Iraq.<ref name=csis8 /> Iran's plan was for three assaults: a diversionary attack near Basra, the main offensive and another diversionary attack using Iranian tanks in the north to divert Iraqi heavy armor from Basra.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> For these battles, Iran had re-expanded their military by recruiting many new Basij and Pasdaran volunteers.<ref name=csis8 /> Iran brought 150,000\u2013200,000 total troops into the battles.<ref name=pollack04 />\n\n====Karbala operations====\n\n=====Operation Karbala-4=====\n\n{{Main|Operation Karbala-4}}\n\nOn 25 December 1986, Iran launched Operation Karbala-4 (''Karbala'' referring to [[Hussein ibn Ali]]'s [[Battle of Karbala]]).<ref name=silverstein10>{{cite book|isbn=978-0-19-160934-3|title=Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction|last=Silverstein|first=Adam J.|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=21 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OKOAkshBSIQC}}</ref> According to Iraqi General Ra'ad al-Hamdani, this was a diversionary attack.<ref name=\"Woods 2010\" /> The Iranians launched an amphibious assault against the Iraqi island of Umm al-Rassas in the Shatt-Al-Arab river, parallel to Khoramshahr; they then set up a pontoon bridge and continued the attack, eventually capturing it in a costly success and failing to advance further; the Iranians had 60,000 casualties, while the Iraqis 9,500.<ref name=\"aboulenein12_dawn3\" /> The Iraqi commanders exaggerated Iranian losses to Saddam and it was assumed that the main Iranian attack on Basra had been fully defeated and that it would take the Iranians six months to recover.

The attack was carried out by Basij infantry and the Revolutionary Guard's 31st ''[[Day of Ashura|Ashura]]'' and the Army's 77th ''Khorasan'' armored divisions. The Basij attacked the Iraqi lines, forcing the Iraqi infantry to retreat. An Iraqi armored counter-attack surrounded the Basij in a pincer movement, but the Iranian tank divisions attacked, breaking the encirclement. The Iranian attack was finally stopped by mass Iraqi chemical weapons attacks.<ref name=iraniraqwar.com>{{cite web|title=Iran\u2013Iraq war|url=http://iraniraqwar.com/about.html|accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Iranian war-weariness====\n\n[[File:152 mm howitzer D-20 belong to Military of Iran.jpg|thumb|Iranian troops fire 152&nbsp;mm D-20 howitzer]]\nOperation Karbala-5 was a severe blow to Iran's military and morale.<ref name=\"Dunn 1998\" /> To foreign observers, it appeared that Iran was continuing to strengthen. By 1988, Iran had become self-sufficient in many areas, such as anti-tank TOW missiles, Scud ballistic missiles ([[Shahab-1]]), [[Silkworm (missile)|Silkworm]] anti-ship missiles, [[Oghab]] tactical rockets, and producing spare parts for their weaponry. Iran had also improved its air defenses with smuggled surface to air missiles.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> Iran even was producing UAV's and the [[Pilatus PC-7]] propeller aircraft for observation.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> Iran also doubled their stocks of artillery, and was self-sufficient in manufacture of ammunition and small arms.<ref name=csis10 />\n\nWhile it was not obvious to foreign observers, the Iranian public had become increasingly war-weary and disillusioned with the fighting, and relatively few volunteers joined the fight in 1987\u201388. Because the Iranian war effort relied on popular mobilization, their military strength actually declined, and Iran was unable to launch any major offensives after Karbala-5. As a result, for the first time since 1982, the momentum of the fighting shifted towards the regular army. Since the regular army was [[conscription]] based, it made the war even less popular. Many Iranians began to try to escape the conflict. As early as May 1985, [[anti-war demonstration]]s took place in 74 cities throughout Iran, which were crushed by the regime, resulting in some protesters being shot and killed.<ref name=spokane85>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1345&dat=19850510&id=FloaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XScEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7018,2528377|title=Anti-war protests reported in Iran|newspaper=Spokane Chronicle|agency=Associated Press|date=10 May 1985|publisher=Google News Archive}}</ref> By 1987, [[Draft dodger|draft-dodging]] had become a serious problem, and the Revolutionary Guards and police set up roadblocks throughout cities to capture those who tried to evade conscription. Other people (including the more nationalistic and religious) as well as the clergy, and the Revolutionary Guards, wished to continue the war.\n\nThe leadership acknowledged that the war was a stalemate, and began to plan accordingly.<ref name=pollack04 /> There were no more \"final offensives\" planned.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> The head of the Supreme Defense Council [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]] announced during a [[news conference]] to finally end the use of human wave attacks.<ref name=\"Sciolino New York Times\">{{cite news|last=Sciolino|first=Elaine|title=Human Wave raid loses Iran's favor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/world/human-wave-raid-losses-iran-s-favor.html}}</ref> [[Mohsen Rezaee]], head of the IRGC, announced that Iran would focus exclusively on limited attacks and infiltrations, while arming and supporting opposition groups inside of Iraq.<ref name=csis8 />\n\nOn the Iranian home front, the combination of sanctions, declining oil prices, and Iraqi attacks on Iranian oil facilities and shipping took a heavy toll on the economy. While the attacks themselves were not as destructive as some analysts believed, the U.S.-led [[Operation Earnest Will]] (which protected Iraqi and allied oil tankers, but not Iranian ones) led many neutral countries to stop trading with Iran because of rising [[insurance]] and fear of air attack.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /><ref name=iranchamber-armingiraq /><ref name=iranchamber-iraniraqwar /> Iranian oil and non-oil exports fell by 55%, inflation reached 50% by 1987, and [[unemployment rate|unemployment]] skyrocketed.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> At the same time, Iraq was experiencing crushing debt and shortages of workers, encouraging its leadership to try to end the war quickly.<ref name=\"Dunn 1998\" />\n\n=====Strategic situation in late 1987=====\n\n{{Main|Operation Nimble Archer|Operation Nasr 4|Operation Karbala 10}}\n\nBy the end of 1987, Iraq possessed 5,550 tanks (outnumbering the Iranians six to one) and 900 fighter aircraft (outnumbering the Iranians ten to one).<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> After Operation Karbala-5, Iraq only had 100 qualified fighter pilots remaining; therefore, Iraq began to invest in recruiting foreign pilots from countries such as [[Belgium]], [[South Africa]], [[Pakistan]], [[East Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>https://kavehfarrokh.com/military-history-1900-present/western-pakistani-and-egyptian-pilots-flying-iraqi-combat-aircraft-during-iran-iraq-war/</ref> They replenished their manpower by integrating volunteers from other Arab countries into their army. Iraq also became self-sufficient in chemical weapons and some conventional ones and received much equipment from abroad.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> Foreign support helped Iraq bypass its economic troubles and massive debt to continue the war and increase the size of its military.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" />\n\nWhile the southern and central fronts were at a stalemate, Iran began to focus on carrying out offensives in northern Iraq with the help of the Peshmerga (Kurdish [[insurgent]]s). The Iranians used a combination of semi-guerrilla and infiltration tactics in the Kurdish mountains with the Peshmerga. During [[Operation Karbala-9]] in early April, Iran captured territory near Suleimaniya, provoking a severe poison gas counter-attack. During [[Operation Karbala-10]], Iran attacked near the same area, capturing more territory. During [[Operation Nasr-4]], the Iranians surrounded the city of Suleimaniya and with the help of the Peshmerga infiltrated over 140&nbsp;km into Iraq and raided and threatened to capture the oil-rich city of [[Kirkuk]] and other northern oilfields.<ref name=\"Dunn 1998\" /> Nasr-4 was considered to be Iran's most successful individual operation of the war but Iranian forces were unable to consolidate their gains and continue their advance; while these offensives coupled with the Kurdish uprising sapped Iraqi strength, losses in the north would not mean a catastrophic failure for Iraq.\n\nOn 20 July, the [[UN Security Council]] passed the U.S.-sponsored Resolution 598, which called for an end to the fighting and a return to pre-war boundaries.<ref name=\"pike\" /> This resolution was noted by Iran for being the first resolution to call for a return to the pre-war borders, and setting up a commission to determine the aggressor and compensation.\n\n=====Air and tanker war in 1987=====\nWith the stalemate on land, the air/tanker war began to play an increasingly major role in the conflict.<ref name=\"Cordesman IX\">{{cite web|last=Cordesman|first=Anthony|title=Lessons of Modern War: The Iran-Iraq War|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/9005lessonsiraniraqii-chap09.pdf}}</ref> The Iranian air force had become very small, having only 20 F-4 Phantoms, 20 F-5 Tigers, and 15 F-14 Tomcats in operation. Despite that, Iran managed to restore some damaged planes into service. The Iranian Air Force, despite its once sophisticated equipment, lacked enough equipment and personnel to sustain the war of attrition that had arisen, and was unable to lead an outright onslaught against Iraq.<ref name=cooper03_205 /> The Iraqi Air Force, however, had originally lacked modern equipment and experienced pilots, but after pleas from Iraqi military leaders, Saddam decreased political influence on everyday operations and left the fighting to his combatants. The Soviets began delivering more advanced aircraft and weapons to Iraq, while the French improved training for flying crews and technical personnel and continually introduced new methods for countering Iranian weapons and tactics.<ref name=cooper03_205 /> Iranian ground air defense still shot down many Iraqi aircraft.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /><ref name=cooper03_205 />\n\nThe main Iraqi air effort had shifted to the destruction of Iranian war-fighting capability (primarily Persian Gulf oil fields, tankers, and Kharg Island) and starting late 1986, the Iraqi Air Force moved on a comprehensive campaign against the Iranian economic infrastructure.<ref name=cooper03_205 /> By late 1987, the Iraqi Air Force could count on direct American support for conducting long-range operations against Iranian infrastructural targets and oil installations deep in the Persian Gulf. U.S. Navy ships tracked and reported movements of Iranian shipping and defences. In the massive Iraqi air strike against Kharg Island, flown on 18 March 1988 the Iraqis destroyed two [[supertankers]] but lost five aircraft to Iranian F-14 Tomcats, including two [[Tupolev Tu-22]]Bs and one [[Mikoyan MiG-25]]RB.<ref name=cooper03_205 /> The U.S. Navy was now becoming more involved in the fight in the Persian Gulf, launching [[Operation Earnest Will|Operations Earnest Will]] and [[Operation Prime Chance|Prime Chance]] against the Iranians.\n\n[[File:Small Boats of Iran in Taker war 3.JPG|thumb|right|IRGC navy speedboats using [[swarming (military)|swarm tactics]]]]\nThe attacks on oil tankers continued. Both Iran and Iraq carried frequent attacks during the first four months of the year. Iran was effectively waging a naval guerilla war with its IRGC navy speedboats, while Iraq attacked with its aircraft. In 1987, Kuwait asked to reflag its tankers to the U.S. flag. They did so in March, and the U.S. Navy began [[Operation Earnest Will]] to escort the tankers.<ref name=\"Cordesman IX\" /> The result of Earnest Will would be that while oil tankers shipping Iraqi/Kuwaiti oil were protected, Iranian tankers, and neutral tankers shipping to Iran would be unprotected, resulting in both losses for Iran and the undermining of its trade with foreign countries, damaging Iran's economy further. Iran also deployed Silkworm missiles to attack some ships, but only a few were actually fired. Both the United States and Iran jockeyed for influence in the Gulf. To discourage the United States from escorting tankers, Iran secretly [[mine (naval)|mined]] some areas in the Gulf. The United States began to escort the reflagged tankers, but one of them was damaged by a mine while under escort. While being a public-relations victory for Iran, the United States increased its reflagging efforts. While Iran mined the Persian Gulf, their speedboat attacks were reduced, primarily attacking unflagged tankers shipping in the area.<ref name=\"Cordesman IX\" />\n\nOn 24 September, [[United States Navy SEALs|US Navy SEALS]] captured the Iranian mine-laying ship ''[[Iran Ajr]]'', a diplomatic disaster for the already isolated Iranians. On 8 October, the U.S. Navy destroyed four Iranian speedboats, and in response to Iranian Silkworm missile attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers, launched [[Operation Nimble Archer]], destroying two Iranian oil rigs in the Persian Gulf.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" /> During November and December, the Iraqi air force launched a bid to destroy all Iranian airbases in Khuzestan and the remaining Iranian air force. Iran managed to shoot down 30 Iraqi fighters with fighter jets, anti-aircraft guns, and missiles, allowing the Iranian air force to survive to the end of the war.<ref name=\"Farrokh 03\" />\n\nOn 28 June, Iraqi [[fighter bombers]] attacked the Iranian town of [[Sardasht, West Azerbaijan|Sardasht]] near the border, using chemical [[mustard gas]] bombs.

These losses included more than 570 of the 1,000 remaining Iranian tanks, over 430 armored vehicles, 45 self-propelled artillery, 300 towed artillery pieces, and 320 antiaircraft guns. These figures only included what Iraq could actually put to use; total amount of captured materiel was higher.

The Iran\u2013Iraq war had been going on for three years and there were significant casualties on both sides, reaching hundreds of thousands. Within the Reagan [[National Security Council (USA)|National Security Council]] concern was growing that the war could spread beyond the boundaries of the two belligerents. A National Security Planning Group meeting was called chaired by Vice President [[George Bush Sr.|George Bush]] to review U.S. options. It was determined that there was a high likelihood that the conflict would spread into Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, but that the United States had little capability to defend the region. Furthermore, it was determined that a prolonged war in the region would induce much higher oil prices and threaten the fragile world recovery which was just beginning to gain momentum. On 22 May 1984, President Reagan was briefed on the project conclusions in the Oval Office by [[William Flynn Martin]] who had served as the head of the NSC staff that organized the study.

Children volunteered as well.

Regular army troops, the paramilitary Revolutionary Guards and [[mullah]]s all lauded these youths, known as baseeji [Basij], for having played the most dangerous role in breaking through Iraqi lines. They had led the way, running over fields of mines to clear the ground for the Iranian ground assault. Wearing white headbands to signify the embracing of death, and shouting \"[[Shahid|Shaheed]], shaheed\" (Martyr, martyr) they literally blew their way into heaven. Their numbers were never disclosed.

Instead of a linear reading of articles one at a time, the method works by keeping a large reading list of electronic articles or books (often dozens or hundreds of them) and reading parts of several articles in each session. Articles in the reading list are prioritized by the user.\n\nIn the course of reading, key points of articles are broken up into [[flashcard|flashcards]], which are then learned and reviewed over an extended period of time with the help of a [[spaced repetition]] algorithm.\n\nThis use of flashcards at later stages of the process is based on psychological principles of [[long-term memory]] storage and retrieval, in particular the [[spacing effect]] (the phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time) and the [[testing effect]] (the finding that long-term memory is increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving the to-be-remembered information through testing).\n\nCurrent implementations include [[spaced repetition]] software [[Anki (software)|Anki]] \u2013 through an add-on<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1081195335|title=Incremental Reading Add-on|publisher=AnkiWeb|date=2017-11-10|accessdate=2017-12-31}}</ref> \u2013 and [[SuperMemo]].

Flashcards are information presented in a question-answer format (making [[active recall]] possible). [[Cloze deletions]] are often used in incremental reading, as they are easy to create out of text. Both extracts and flashcards are scheduled independently from the original article.\n\nWith time and reviews, articles are supposed to be gradually converted into extracts, and extracts into flashcards. Hence, incremental reading is a method of breaking down information from electronic articles into sets of flashcards.\n\nContrary to extracts, flashcards are reviewed with [[active recall]]. This means that extracts such as \"George Washington was the first U.S. President\" must ultimately be converted into questions such as \"Who was the first U.S. President?\" (Answer: George Washington), or \"Who was George Washington?\" (Answer: the first U.S. President), etc, or [[cloze deletion|cloze deletions]] such as \"[BLANK] was the first U.S. President\", \"George Washington was [BLANK]\", etc.\n\nThis flashcard creation process is semi-automated \u2013 the reader chooses which material to learn and edits the precise wording of the questions, while the software assists in prioritizing articles and making the flashcards, and does the scheduling: it calculates the ideal time for the reader to review each chunk, according to the rules of [[spaced repetition]]. This means that all processed pieces of information are presented at increasing intervals.\n\nIndividual articles are read in portions proportional to the [[attention span]], which depends on the user, their mood, the article, etc. This allows for a substantial gain in attention, according to [[Piotr Wozniak (researcher)|Piotr Wozniak]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Piotr Wozniak |url= https://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm#Attention|title=Advantages of incremental reading: attention|accessdate=2017-12-12}}</ref>\n\nWithout the use of spaced repetition, the reader would quickly get lost in the glut of information when studying dozens of subjects in parallel. However, spaced repetition makes it possible to retain traces of the processed material in memory.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading Incremental reading (supermemo.org)]\n* [http://supermemo.com/help/faq/read.htm FAQ : Incremental reading (supermemo.com)]\n* [http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm Incremental learning (super-memory.com)]\n* [https://lifehacker.com/5597373/use-incremental-reading-to-memorize-large-batches-of-data Kevin Purdy, ''Use Incremental Reading to Memorize Large Batches of Data'' (lifehacker.com)]\n\n{{Spaced repetition}}\n\n[[Category:Learning]]\n[[Category:Learning methods]]\n[[Category:Reading (process)]]", "sha1": "pwpm9utzirvpaaw33qatopmd1jsljrc"}}, {"title": "Intelligence quotient", "ns": "0", "id": "14892", "revision": {"id": "865702371", "parentid": "865638990", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T16:18:53Z", "contributor": {"username": "JzG", "id": "760284"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/MichaelMiletic|MichaelMiletic]] ([[User talk:MichaelMiletic|talk]]) to last version by 2600:1:F56C:E3FF:5967:EB77:BB79:1E26", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|IQ}}{{pp-move-indef}}<!-- \n\nThis article uses the citation templates described in [[User:RexxS/Cite_multiple_pages]].

Raw scores on IQ tests for many populations have been rising at an average rate that scales to three IQ points per decade since the early 20th century, a phenomenon called the [[Flynn effect]]. Investigation of different patterns of increases in subtest scores can also inform current research on human intelligence.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of the race and intelligence controversy}}\n\n===Precursors to IQ testing===\nHistorically, even before IQ tests were devised, there were attempts to classify people into [[Human intelligence|intelligence]] categories by observing their behavior in daily life.<ref name=\"TermanOldClasses\" /><ref name=\"WechslerOldClasses\" /> Those other forms of behavioral observation are still important for validating classifications based primarily on IQ test scores. Both intelligence classification by observation of behavior outside the testing room and classification by IQ testing depend on the definition of \"intelligence\" used in a particular case and on the [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] and error of estimation in the classification procedure.\n\nThe English statistician [[Francis Galton]] made the first attempt at creating a standardized test for rating a person's intelligence. A pioneer of [[psychometrics]] and the application of statistical methods to the study of human diversity and the study of inheritance of human traits, he believed that intelligence was largely a product of heredity (by which he did not mean [[History of genetics#Post-Mendel, pre-re-discovery|genes]], although he did develop several pre-Mendelian theories of particulate inheritance).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bulmer |first1=M |year=1999 |title=The development of Francis Galton's ideas on the mechanism of heredity |url=|journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=263\u2013292 | doi = 10.1023/a:1004608217247 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cowan |first1=R.

(Fancher, 1985). Binet thought that intelligence was multifaceted, but came under the control of practical judgment.\n\nIn Binet's view, there were limitations with the scale and he stressed what he saw as the remarkable diversity of intelligence and the subsequent need to study it using qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, measures (White, 2000). American psychologist [[Henry H. Goddard]] published a translation of it in 1910. American psychologist [[Lewis Terman]] at [[Stanford University]] revised the Binet-Simon scale, which resulted in the [[Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales]] (1916).

Some test items are visual, while many are verbal. Test items vary from being based on abstract-reasoning problems to concentrating on arithmetic, vocabulary, or general knowledge.\n\nThe British psychologist [[Charles Spearman]] in 1904 made the first formal [[factor analysis]] of [[correlation]]s between the tests. He observed that children's school grades across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated, and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance on all kinds of mental tests. He suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor and a large number of narrow task-specific ability factors. Spearman named it ''g'' for \"general factor\" and labeled the specific factors or abilities for specific tasks ''s''. In any collection of test items that make up an IQ test, the score that best measures ''g'' is the composite score that has the highest correlations with all the item scores. Typically, the \"''g''-loaded\" composite score of an IQ test battery appears to involve a common strength in abstract reasoning across the test's item content. Therefore, Spearman and others have regarded ''g'' as closely related to the essence of human intelligence.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nSpearman's argument proposing a general factor of human intelligence is still accepted in principle by many psychometricians. Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, where there are a large number of narrow factors at the bottom of the hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the ''g'' factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks. However, this view is not universally accepted; other factor analyses of the data, with different results, are possible. Some psychometricians regard ''g'' as a statistical artifact.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===United States military selection in World War I===\nDuring World War I, a way was needed to evaluate and assign Army recruits to appropriate tasks.

It gradually became more popular and overtook the Stanford-Binet in the 1960s. It has been revised several times, as is common for IQ tests, to incorporate new research. One explanation is that psychologists and educators wanted more information than the single score from the Binet. Wechsler's ten or more subtests provided this. Another is that the Stanford-Binet test reflected mostly verbal abilities, while the Wechsler test also reflected nonverbal abilities. The Stanford-Binet has also been revised several times and is now similar to the Wechsler in several aspects, but the Wechsler continues to be the most popular test in the United States.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n=== IQ testing and the Eugenics movement in the United States ===\nEugenics refers to the principles of heredity used to improve the human race.

In 1908, he published his own version, ''The Binet and Simon Test of Intellectual Capacity'', and cordially promoted the test. He quickly extended the use of the scale to the public schools (1913), to immigration ([[Ellis Island]], 1914) and to a court of law (1914).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/assessment.aspx|title=The birth of American intelligence testing|website=http://www.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}</ref>\n\nDifferent from Galton, who promoted eugenics through selective breeding for positive traits, Goddard went with the US eugenics movement to eliminate \"undesirable\" traits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/forums/genetics-generation/america-s-hidden-history-the-eugenics-movement-123919444|title=America's Hidden History: The Eugenics Movement {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}</ref> Goddard used the term \"[[feeble-minded]]\" to refer to people who did not perform well in the test and thus were intellectually inferior.

[[Fluid intelligence]] (Gf) was hypothesized as the ability to solve novel problems by using reasoning, and [[crystallized intelligence]] (Gc) was hypothesized as a knowledge-based ability that was very dependent on education and experience. In addition, fluid intelligence was hypothesized to decline with age, while crystallized intelligence was largely resistant to the effects of aging. The theory was almost forgotten, but was revived by his student [[John L. Horn]] (1966) who later argued Gf and Gc were only two among several factors, and who eventually identified nine or ten broad abilities. The theory continued to be called Gf-Gc theory.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n[[John Bissell Carroll|John B. Carroll]] (1993), after a comprehensive reanalysis of earlier data, proposed the [[three stratum theory]], which is a hierarchical model with three levels. The bottom stratum consists of narrow abilities that are highly specialized (e.g., induction, spelling ability). The second stratum consists of broad abilities. Carroll identified eight second-stratum abilities.

It has greatly influenced many of the current broad IQ tests.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\nIn CHC theory, a hierarchy of factors is used; ''g'' is at the top. Under it are ten broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into seventy narrow abilities. The broad abilities are:<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n* [[Fluid intelligence]] (Gf) includes the broad ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures.\n* [[Crystallized intelligence]] (Gc) includes the breadth and depth of a person's acquired knowledge, the ability to communicate one's knowledge, and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures.\n* Quantitative reasoning (Gq) is the ability to comprehend quantitative concepts and relationships and to manipulate numerical symbols.\n* Reading and writing ability (Grw) includes basic reading and writing skills.\n* Short-term memory (Gsm) is the ability to apprehend and hold information in immediate awareness, and then use it within a few seconds.\n* Long-term storage and retrieval (Glr) is the ability to store information and fluently retrieve it later in the process of thinking.\n* Visual processing (Gv) is the ability to perceive, analyze, synthesize, and think with visual patterns, including the ability to store and recall visual representations.\n* Auditory processing (Ga) is the ability to analyze, synthesize, and discriminate auditory stimuli, including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions.\n* Processing speed (Gs) is the ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks, particularly when measured under pressure to maintain focused attention.\n* Decision/reaction time/speed (Gt) reflects the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task (typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds; it is not to be confused with Gs, which typically is measured in intervals of 2\u20133 minutes). See [[Mental chronometry]].\nModern tests do not necessarily measure all of these broad abilities. For example, Gq and Grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not IQ.<ref name=Kaufman2009/> Gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment. ''g'' was earlier often subdivided into only Gf and Gc, which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular Wechsler IQ test. More recent research has shown the situation to be more complex.<ref name=\"Kaufman2009\" /> Modern comprehensive IQ tests do not stop at reporting a single IQ score. Although they still give an overall score, they now also give scores for many of these more restricted abilities, identifying particular strengths and weaknesses of an individual.<ref name=\"Kaufman2009\" />\n\n===Other theories===\n[[J.P. Guilford]]'s [[J.P. Guilford#Guilford's Structure of Intellect|Structure of Intellect]] (1967) model used three dimensions which when combined yielded a total of 120 types of intelligence. It was popular in the 1970s and early 1980s, but faded owing to both practical problems and [[theoretical]] criticisms.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n[[Alexander Luria]]'s earlier work on neuropsychological processes led to the PASS theory (1997). It argued that only looking at one general factor was inadequate for researchers and clinicians who worked with learning disabilities, attention disorders, intellectual disability, and interventions for such disabilities. The PASS model covers four kinds of processes (planning process, attention/arousal process, simultaneous processing, and successive processing). The planning processes involve decision making, problem solving, and performing activities and requires goal setting and self-monitoring.\n\nThe attention/arousal process involves selectively attending to a particular stimulus, ignoring distractions, and maintaining vigilance. Simultaneous processing involves the integration of stimuli into a group and requires the observation of relationships. Successive processing involves the integration of stimuli into serial order.

In this model, the Flynn effect can be explained by an increase in environmental stimulation independent of it being sought out by individuals.

Several factors can lead to significant cognitive impairment, particularly if they occur during pregnancy and childhood when the brain is growing and the blood\u2013brain barrier is less effective. Such impairment may sometimes be permanent, sometimes be partially or wholly compensated for by later growth. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nSince about 2010, researchers such as Eppig, Hassel, and MacKenzie have found a very close and consistent link between IQ scores and infectious diseases, especially in the infant and preschool populations and the mothers of these children.<ref>Eppig. Christopher. Scientific American.\"Why is average IQ higher in some places?\" 2011.</ref> They have postulated that fighting infectious diseases strains the child's metabolism and prevents full brain development. Hassel postulated that it is by far the most important factor in determining population IQ. However, they also found that subsequent factors such as good nutrition and regular quality schooling can offset early negative effects to some extent.\n\nDeveloped nations have implemented several health policies regarding nutrients and toxins known to influence cognitive function. These include laws requiring fortification of certain food products and laws establishing safe levels of pollutants (e.g. [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and organochlorides). Improvements in nutrition, and in public policy in general, have been implicated in worldwide IQ increases. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nCognitive epidemiology is a field of research that examines the associations between intelligence test scores and health. Researchers in the field argue that intelligence measured at an early age is an important predictor of later health and mortality differences.\n\n==Social correlations==\n===School performance===\nThe [[American Psychological Association]]'s report ''Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns'' states that wherever it has been studied, children with high scores on tests of intelligence tend to learn more of what is taught in school than their lower-scoring peers. The correlation between IQ scores and grades is about .50. This means that the explained variance is 25%. Achieving good grades depends on many factors other than IQ, such as \"persistence, interest in school, and willingness to study\" (p.&nbsp;81).<ref name=\"Neisser95\" />\n\nIt has been found that the correlation of IQ scores with school performance depends on the IQ measurement used.

Psychometric intelligence appears as only one of a great many factors that influence social outcomes.<ref name=\"Neisser95\" />\n\nIn a meta-analysis, Strenze (2006) reviewed much of the literature and estimated the correlation between IQ and income to be about 0.23.<ref name=\"Strenze2007\">{{cite journal|last1=Strenze|first1=Tarmo|title=Intelligence and socioeconomic success: A meta-analytic review of longitudinal research|journal=Intelligence|volume=35|issue=5|year=2007|pages=401\u2013426|issn=0160-2896|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004|url=http://www.emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Intelligence-and-socioeconomic-success-A-meta-analytic-review-of-longitudinal-research.pdf|quote=The correlation with income is considerably lower, perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the average of the previous meta-analytic estimates (.15 by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005).

This claim is further corroborated by the meta-analysis of Ng et al. (2005) where the best predictor of salary was educational level with a correlation of only .29. It should also be noted that the correlation of .23 is about the size of the average meta-analytic result in psychology (Hemphill, 2003) and cannot, therefore, be treated as insignificant.}}</ref>\n\nSome studies claim that IQ only accounts for (explains) a sixth of the variation in income because many studies are based on young adults, many of whom have not yet reached their peak earning capacity, or even their education. On pg 568 of ''[[The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability|The g Factor]]'', Arthur Jensen claims that although the correlation between IQ and income averages a moderate 0.4 (one sixth or 16% of the variance), the relationship increases with age, and peaks at middle age when people have reached their maximum career potential. In the book, ''A Question of Intelligence'', [[Daniel Seligman]] cites an IQ income correlation of 0.5 (25% of the variance).\n\nA 2002 study<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowles |first1=Samuel |last2=Gintis |first2=Herbert |title=The Inheritance of Inequality |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=3\u201330 |year=2002 |doi=10.1257/089533002760278686}}</ref> further examined the impact of non-IQ factors on income and concluded that an individual's location, inherited wealth, race, and schooling are more important as factors in determining income than IQ.\n\n===Crime===\nThe American Psychological Association's 1995 report ''Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns'' stated that the correlation between IQ and crime was \u22120.2. It was \u22120.19 between IQ scores and number of juvenile offenses in a large Danish sample; with social class controlled, the correlation dropped to \u22120.17. A correlation of 0.20 means that the [[explained variance]] is 4%. The causal links between psychometric ability and social outcomes may be indirect. Children with poor scholastic performance may feel alienated. Consequently, they may be more likely to engage in delinquent behavior, compared to other children who do well.<ref name=\"Neisser95\" />\n\nIn his book ''[[The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability|The g Factor]]'' (1998), [[Arthur Jensen]] cited data which showed that, regardless of race, people with IQs between 70 and 90 have higher crime rates than people with IQs below or above this range, with the peak range being between 80 and 90.\n\nThe 2009 ''Handbook of Crime Correlates'' stated that reviews have found that around eight IQ points, or 0.5 SD, separate criminals from the general population, especially for persistent serious offenders. It has been suggested that this simply reflects that \"only dumb ones get caught\" but there is similarly a negative relation between IQ and self-reported offending.

However, in the case of [[Griggs v. Duke Power Co.]] in 1971, for the purpose of minimizing employment practices that disparately impacted racial minorities, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the use of IQ tests in employment, except when linked to job performance via a [[job analysis]]. Internationally, certain public policies, such as improving nutrition and prohibiting [[neurotoxins]], have as one of their goals raising, or preventing a decline in, intelligence.\n\nA diagnosis of [[intellectual disability]] is in part based on the results of IQ testing. [[Borderline intellectual functioning]] is a categorization where a person has below average cognitive ability (an IQ of 71\u201385), but the deficit is not as severe as intellectual disability (70 or below).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the [[eleven plus exam]] which incorporated an intelligence test has been used from 1945 to decide, at eleven years of age, which type of school a child should go to. They have been much less used since the widespread introduction of [[comprehensive school]]s.\n\n==Criticism and views==\n===Relationship to intelligence===\n{{See also|Intelligence}}\nIQ is the most thoroughly researched means of measuring intelligence, and by far the most widely used in practical settings. However, while IQ strives to measure some concepts of intelligence, it may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of intelligence. IQ tests examine some areas of intelligence, while neglecting to account for other areas, such as [[creativity]] and [[social intelligence]].\n\nCritics such as [[Keith Stanovich]] do not dispute the reliability of IQ test scores or their capacity to predict some kinds of achievement, but argue that basing a concept of intelligence on IQ test scores alone neglects other important aspects of mental ability.<ref name=\"Neisser95\"/><ref>[[David Brooks (journalist)|Brooks, David]] (September 14, 2007).

In ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1996), [[paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticized IQ tests and argued that they were used for [[scientific racism]]. He argued that ''g'' was a mathematical artifact and criticized:\n\n{{quote|...the abstraction of intelligence as a single entity, its location within the brain, its quantification as one number for each individual, and the use of these numbers to rank people in a single series of worthiness, invariably to find that oppressed and disadvantaged groups\u2014races, classes, or sexes\u2014are innately inferior and deserve their status.<ref>pp. 24\u201325</ref>}}\n\n[[Arthur Jensen]] responded:\n\n{{quote|...what Gould has mistaken for \"reification\" is neither more nor less than the common practice in every science of hypothesizing explanatory models to account for the observed relationships within a given domain. Well known examples include the heliocentric theory of planetary motion, the Bohr atom, the electromagnetic field, the kinetic theory of gases, gravitation, quarks, Mendelian genes, mass, velocity, etc. None of these constructs exists as a palpable entity occupying physical space.<ref>''Contemporary Education Review,'' 1982</ref>}}\n\nJensen also argued that even if ''g'' were replaced by a model with several intelligences this would change the situation less than expected. He argues that all tests of cognitive ability would continue to be highly correlated with one another and there would still be a black-white gap on cognitive tests.<ref name=\"jensen\">{{cite journal | author=Jensen Arthur | year=1982 | title=The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons | url=http://www.debunker.com/texts/jensen.html | journal=Contemporary Education Review | volume=1 | issue=2 | pages=121\u2013135 }}</ref> [[Hans Eysenck]] responded to Gould by stating that no psychologist had said that intelligence was an area located in the brain.<ref>Eysenck, Hans Intelligence: A New Look Transaction Publishers page 74</ref> Eysenck also argued IQ tests were not racist, pointing out that Northeast Asians and Jews both scored higher than non-Jewish Europeans on IQ tests, and this would not please European racists.<ref>Eysenck, Hans Intelligence: A New Look Transaction Publishers page 10</ref>\n\nPsychologist [[Peter Schonemann|Peter Sch\u00f6nemann]] persistently criticized IQ, calling it \"the IQ myth\".

Wagner. \"The g-ocentric view of intelligence and job performance is wrong.\" Current directions in psychological science (1993): 1\u20135.</ref>\n\n===Systematic exclusion of threshold effects===\nCecil Reynolds and  Paul Kline argue that the construction of IQ tests around the rule that they should show a [[bell curve]] distribution in the population leads to systematic exclusion of cognitive tests that display threshold effects and are not gradually variable, as well as biasing IQ tests towards questions that can be made to fit a bell curve model and against questions that show any non-bell distributions. They argue that just as [[swarm]]s change their collective behavior at certain thresholds of animals in the swarm, it is possible that brains change their abilities at thresholds of number of connected neurons and/or level of connectivity. Cecil Reynolds and  Paul Kline argue that such a bias may be the reason why IQ tests yield paradoxes such as the heredity paradox between high heredity showed by [[twin study|twin studies]] and the high environmental effect shown by the [[Flynn effect]] and suggest that other cognitive tests that do not conform to bell curve distributions should be tried with the possibility that some of them may produce [[falsifiability|falsifiable predictions]] of key abilities requiring a critical level of underlying quantitative brain access and simpler proxies of such in every case, unlike IQ tests which are argued to fail the falsifiability criterion by defining away problems by systematically demanding bell curves and failing to make any absolute system requirement predictions of what brain capacity is required to make a certain performance. It is argued that probabilistic predictions with loopholes for \"exceptions\" are not scientifically appliceable to capacity theories, as capacities follow minimum system requirements for performing tasks.<ref>Cecil Reynolds Perspectives on Bias in Mental Testing book {{ISBN|978-1-4684-4658-6}} (2013)</ref><ref>Paul Kline The New Psychometrics: Science, Psychology and Measurement book {{ISBN|978-0415228213}} (2014)</ref>\n\n===Test bias===\n{{See also|Stereotype threat}}\nThe American Psychological Association's report ''Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns'' stated that in the United States IQ tests as predictors of social achievement are not biased against African Americans since they predict future performance, such as school achievement, similarly to the way they predict future performance for Caucasians.<ref name=\"Neisser95\" /> While agreeing that IQ tests predict performance equally well for all racial groups, [[Nicholas Mackintosh]] also points out that there may still be a bias inherent in IQ testing if the education system is also systematically biased against African Americans, in which case educational performance may in fact also be an underestimation of African American children's cognitive abilities.<ref>{{Cite book |title=IQ and Human Intelligence |last=Mackintosh |first=N.

Uzzell and Harvey N. Switzky argue that defining IQ from an average at a period of time and putting different thresholds of what is considered retarded based on average IQ test performance in a culture faces issues of defining who belongs to what culture. They argue that since people are not actually in boxes of isolated cultures, essentialistic classification of culture that is said to make IQ tests \"culturally fair\" will show false \"evidence\" of underlying cognitive differences between individuals who are formally classified in the same culture but have faced different cultural non-shared environments due to the fluid intermingling of cultures in real life, making IQ tests a false measure of mental retardation. It is argued by Barbara P. Uzzell and Harvey N. Switzky that different social treatment depending on hereditary factors in appearance that may not necessarily be classified as \"racial\" but can often be considered individual leads to an appearance of genes for such appearances being linked to learned behaviors and false evidence of the genes affecting the brain's response to the environment, and that environmental differences in whether other people with whom a person speaks are willing to counter misunderstandings with factual arguments or dismisses the person as \"incapable of reasoning if he or she does not already know it\" [[self-fulfilling prophecy|creates differences in the opportunities to learn rules]] that can be used for solving problems in IQ tests and that widespread persistence of such cultural treatment gives a false appearance of IQ tests being reliable and valid measures of underlying cognitive abilities. It is argued that such effects of different opportunities to sharpen arguments through debate in all walks of life, including prejudice towards choice of words shaped by earlier differences in debate opportunities, make different predictions than lab setting only [[stereotype threat]] theory and must therefore be tested by different evidence than that theory, and that discrimination in society based on choice of words is a possible explanation of apparent links between IQ test performance and success in society.<ref>Barbara P.

The full text of the report is available through several websites.<ref name=\"Neisser95\" />\n\nIn this paper, the representatives of the association regret that IQ-related works are frequently written with a view to their political consequences: \"research findings were often assessed not so much on their merits or their scientific standing as on their supposed political implications\".\n\nThe task force concluded that IQ scores do have high predictive validity for individual differences in school achievement. They confirm the predictive validity of IQ for adult occupational status, even when variables such as education and family background have been statistically controlled. They stated that individual differences in intelligence are substantially influenced by both genetics and environment.\n\nThe report stated that a number of biological factors, including malnutrition, exposure to toxic substances, and various prenatal and perinatal stressors, result in lowered psychometric intelligence under at least some conditions. The task force agrees that large differences do exist between the average IQ scores of blacks and whites, saying:\n\n{{quote|The cause of that differential is not known; it is apparently not due to any simple form of bias in the content or administration of the tests themselves. The Flynn effect shows that environmental factors can produce differences of at least this magnitude, but that effect is mysterious in its own right. Several culturally based explanations of the Black/ White IQ differential have been proposed; some are plausible, but so far none has been conclusively supported. There is even less empirical support for a genetic interpretation. In short, no adequate explanation of the differential between the IQ means of Blacks and Whites is presently available.}}\n\nThe APA journal that published the statement, ''[[American Psychologist]],'' subsequently published eleven critical responses in January 1997, several of them arguing that the report failed to examine adequately the evidence for partly genetic explanations.\n\n===Dynamic assessment===\nAn alternative to standard IQ tests originated in the writings of psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896\u20131934) from his last two years of work.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mindes|first1=Gayle|title=Assessing Young Children|date=2003|publisher=Merrill/Prentice Hall|isbn=9780130929082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x41LAAAAYAAJ|language=en|page=158}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Haywood|first1=H.

The institute was started in December 1959 in a room in the canteen building of the [[Harcourt Butler Technological Institute]] at Agricultural Gardens in Kanpur. In 1963, the institute moved to its present location, on the [[Grand Trunk Road]] near the locality of Kalyanpur in Kanpur district.\n\nDuring the first ten years of its existence, a consortium of nine US universities (namely [[M.I.T]], [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[California Institute of Technology]], [[Princeton University]], [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]], [[University of Michigan]], [[Ohio State University]],\n[[Case Western Reserve University|Case Institute of Technology]] and [[Purdue University]]) helped set up IIT Kanpur's research laboratories and academic programmes under the Kanpur Indo-American Programme (KIAP).<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web\n |last        = Kelkar\n |first       = P.K.\n |date        = 17 March 2006\n |url         = http://www.iitk.ac.in/infocell/iitk/newhtml/history.htm\n |title       = IIT Kanpur&nbsp;\u2014 History\n |publisher   = IIT Kanpur\n |accessdate  = 27 May 2006\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091010172800/http://www.iitk.ac.in/infocell/iitk/newhtml/history.htm\n |archivedate = 10 October 2009\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The first Director of the Institute was [[P.

Subbarao: ''An Eye for Excellence, Fifty Innovative Years of IIT Kanpur''; Harper Collins Publishers, India, 2008.</ref> The earliest computer courses were started at IIT Kanpur in August 1963 on an [[IBM 1620]] system. The initiative for computer education came from the [[Electrical engineering]] department, then under the chairmanship of Prof. [[H.K. Kesavan]], who was concurrently the chairman of Electrical Engineering and head of the Computer Centre. Prof. [[Harry Huskey]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], who preceded Kesavan, helped{{clarify|date=April 2015}} with the computer activity at IIT-Kanpur. In 1971, the institute began an independent academic program in Computer Science and Engineering, leading to M.Tech. and Ph.D. degrees.\n\nIn 1972 the KIAP program ended, in part because of tensions due to the U.S. support of Pakistan.  Government funding was also reduced as a reaction to the sentiment that the IIT's were contributing to the [[human capital flight|brain drain]].\n\n==Campus==\n {{wide image|IIT Kanpur panaroma from Hall 7.jpg|1200px|IIT Kanpur panorama from Hall 7}}\nIIT Kanpur is located on the [[Grand Trunk Road]], {{convert|15|km}} west of Kanpur City and measures close to {{convert|420|ha}}.

The cost of construction is estimated to be about 25 crores. The new campus will have an auditorium, seminar halls for organising national and international conferences and an International Relations Office along with a 7-storey guest house. Several short-term management courses and refresher courses meant for distance learning will be available at the extension center.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140202100045/http://www.iitk.ac.in/drpg/social_media/Greeting_2012.htm News from].
