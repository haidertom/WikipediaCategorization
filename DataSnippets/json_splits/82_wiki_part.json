He is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] male [[goose]] (or gander) who possesses exceptional good [[luck]] that grants him anything he desires as well as protecting from any harm. This is in contrast to his cousin [[Donald Duck]] who is often characterized for having bad luck. Gladstone is also a rival of Donald for the affection of [[Daisy Duck]]. Gladstone dresses in a very debonair way, often in a suit; wearing a [[Bow tie|bow-tie]], [[fedora]] and [[Spats (footwear)|spats]]. He has a wavy hairstyle which is most often depicted either as white or blonde. In the story \"[[Luck of the North]]\" (December, 1949) he is described as having a brassy voice.\n\n== Origin ==\nGladstone Gander first appeared in \"[[Wintertime Wager]]\" in ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #88 (January, 1948), written and drawn by Carl Barks. In that story he arrives at Donald Duck's house during a freezing cold Christmas Day to remind him of a wager Donald made the previous summer; that he could swim in the Frozenbear Lake during Christmas Day or forfeit his house to Gladstone. Donald eventually loses the wager but Gladstone later on loses a wager of his own, brought to light by Daisy Duck, and thus Donald's house is returned to him.\n\nBarks gradually developed Gladstone's personality and demeanor after his first appearance and used him quite frequently\u2014in 24 stories between 1948 and 1953, the first five years of his existence. In his first three appearances in 1948 (\"Wintertime Wager\", \"Gladstone Returns\", \"Links Hijinks\"), he was portrayed as the mirror image of Donald: an obstinate braggart, perhaps just a little bit more arrogant, but didn't yet have his characteristic luck. In his next two appearances, \"Rival Beachcombers\" and \"The Goldilocks Gambit\", Gladstone is portrayed as merely lazy and irritable, and also gullible. The breakthrough of his lucky streak occurs in 1949, within the adventure story \"[[Race to the South Seas!]]\" (''[[March of Comics]]'' #41). In that story Donald and Huey, Dewey and Louie set sails on a rescue mission from [[Duckburg]] to a remote Pacific island on which [[Scrooge McDuck]] is believed to have stranded, in an attempt gain their uncle's favor. For the same reason Gladstone is in hot pursuit as well but because he was \"born lucky\" as Donald explains to his nephews, without lifting a finger, is having a much easier time than them.\n\nHis and Donald's rivalry over Daisy is established in \"Donald's Love Letters\" (1949), \"Wild About Flowers\" (1950), and \"Knightly Rivals\" (1951), and as potential heirs to Scrooge's fortune in \"Some Heir Over the Rainbow\" (1953). After that, Barks felt unable to develop the character further, finding him basically unsympathetic, and began using him less frequently. But by then, Gladstone had found a steady place in the [[Donald Duck universe|Duck universe]] as one of the main established characters; frequently used by other writers and artists both in the [[Americas]] and [[Europe]]. He was first used by an artist other than Barks in 1951: \"Presents For All\" by Del Connell and Bob Moore. He appears as a main character in the [[Big Little Book series]] book \"Luck of the Ducks\" (1969).\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:Gladstone A Financial Fable.jpg|left|thumb|Example of Gladstone Gander's luck and laziness. From \"[[A Financial Fable]]\" (September 14, 1950) by Carl Barks.]]\nGladstone's good luck defies [[probability]] and provides him with anything that would be to his benefit or enjoyment; as well as things he specifically wishes for, which are at times related to the plot of some stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/lucky-gladstone-gander-makes-his-appearence-as-ducktale-1819462592|title=Lucky Gladstone Gander makes his appearance <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki> as DuckTales shows its hand|first=Kevin|last=Johnson|website=[[The A.V.

At times he might not even know that a situation will work out in his favor in a later stage and by then often feeling confused or at times even thinking his luck has abandoned him; just to learn that it has been with him all along.\n\nThere have been various explanations for Gladstone\u2019s good luck over the years by various writers and artists. In Barks' story \u201cLuck of the North\u201d Gladstone proclaims: \u201cI was born under a lucky star, and everything I do will bring me good fortune [...].\u201d This is read from a [[horoscope]] book he owns which also has a map showing his lucky star conniving with the planet [[Neptune|Neptunus]]. In many of the [[Italy|Italian]] comic books stories Gladstone is bestowed with his luck because [[Fortuna]], the goddess of fortune, is in love with him. In Don Rosa's story \"[[The Sign of the Triple Distelfink]]\" (1997), he added the fact that Gladstone was born on the day of his mother Daphne's birthday in 1920, under the protection sign of the Triple Distelfink, thus inheriting his mother's luck. In some stories he also uses [[good luck charm]]s like lucky horseshoes or rabbits foots.\n\nHowever, for all his luck Gladstone has no achievements to be proud of and no true ambitions, as he is incapable of long-term planning. This is all because of that he doesn't have to make the slightest of efforts to get what he wants, as his good luck will just give it to him in the end. He also often do not learn any life lessons from any misfortunes he could experience. This leads him to be extremely lazy; at times even thinking that willfully wishing for something is hard work, and disconnected from the realities of ordinary life. All of this is in stark contrast to his relative Scrooge McDuck, who is also capable of taking advantage of opportunities but works hard to create situations favorable for him; is strongly motivated by his ambitions and takes pride in forming his fortune by his own efforts and experiences. Instead, Gladstone often shows pride in his effortlessness and expresses great anxiety if he would betray those ideals. This is something first explored in more detail in Carl Barks's story \"Gladstone's Terrible Secret\" (May, 1952). Comic artist and writer Don Rosa has commented has this on the character: \"Gladstone is unwilling to make the slightest effort to gain something that his [[luck]] cannot give him, and, when things go wrong, he resigns immediately, certain that around the next corner a wallet, dropped by a passer-by, will be waiting for him\".\n\nAlso because of his good fortune, Gladstone is most often characterized to be very snobbish and a gloat; especially (and in some stories exclusively) toward his cousin Donald to whom he also can be very aggravating. For all of these reasons, he and Donald have formed an intense rivalry with each other. Gladstone's outrageous luck and boastfulness toward his cousin, combined with Donald's own ego and belief he can still best him despite all odds---or as Don Rosa's version of Donald comments, \"Donald's eternal tendency towards self-destruction\"---have set the stage for many stories featuring the two cousins' confrontations. They have however worked together or at least tolerated each other at times but this is very rare and not without some tension that easily can turn into their ordinary rivalry.\n\nOccasionally, he is a rival to Scrooge McDuck himself who resents his complete reliance on his uncanny good luck. In such stories, often the only way Gladstone can be believably defeated is to have him win by the letter of the original story preset while the heroes later on take the bigger prize. In Carl Barks' story \"The Golden Nugget Boat\" (''Uncle Scrooge'' #35, September 1961), Gladstone and Scrooge are competing in a gold prospecting contest in which Gladstone finds a gold nugget the nephews fashioned from a gold item Scrooge already owns to stop him from killing himself from overexertion in the contest. Gladstone finds the nugget and returns to win, but Scrooge and his nephews then find a much bigger nugget they are able to fashion into a boat to return to civilization afterward with a monetary worth that is easily more than Gladstone's find. Another instance of this with his rivalry with Donald was in the \"Salmon Derby\" (''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #167, August 1954), where Gladstone catches the biggest fish and wins a new car but Donald manages to save a wealthy tycoon's daughter and is able to purchase a much bigger car. Another instance was when both Donald and Gladstone were competing for a job as a cameraman for a nature film director because Daisy was the director's assistant, Gladstone got the job but wished he hadn't because he wound up trudging through a swamp to film giant spiders while Daisy stayed behind in America, with Donald.\n\nIn more modern stories were he takes a more protagonistic role, writers most often downplays his unlikability to make him more relatable. For example, showing that he can learn from potential bad experiences, even if they never would become reality, and put more emphasis on his love for his family, even if he at times has a hard time expressing these feelings.\n\nIn many stories Gladstone is also considered among the prime candidates for Scrooge McDuck's succession. In \"Some Heir Over the Rainbow\" (''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #155, August 1953) by Carl Barks, Scrooge gives $1,000 to Donald, Gladstone, and Huey, Dewey and Louie to determine how they use it in order to be the most suitable heir to his fortune, Gladstone thinks of using the money to buy a television set until he finds a raffle ticket, in which he decides to save the money by placing it in a tree. Scrooge is unimpressed that Gladstone didn't increase the money at all, but acknowledges that at least he still \"had\" it. Huey, Dewey and Louie infuriate Scrooge by investing their money in what Scrooge assumes was a scam. Finally, Scrooge thinks to himself, \"I guess my heir will have to be Gladstone Gander! .... What an awful injustice to the world!\" Soon afterwards, however, the children's decision proves to be the wisest, and they become Scrooge's heirs instead of Gladstone.\n\nHe is a rival of Donald for the love of Donald's girlfriend [[Daisy Duck]]. This is often portrayed either by showing Daisy uncertain of which one she likes the most or; the more common version, that she is angry with Donald and goes out with Gladstone instead to make Donald jealous. In modern comics this love-triangle is at times often more downplayed. However, despite having an eternal crush on Daisy Duck, Gladstone has appeared in love with other duck girls in [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Denmark|Danish]] comic stories. One of those is Linda Paper, who really conquered Gladstone, making him want to give up all his luck, since she's unlucky and absolutely hates lucky people. She appeared in two subsequent comic stories. Another is Feather Mallard who is as lucky as Gladstone but whenever they are together they are instead experiencing bad luck. A number of recent Italian stories feature Gladstone's protector [[goddess]] Fortuna appearing in person. She appears in one noteworthy tale, \"Gastone e il debole dalla Fortuna\" (\"Gladstone and the Struck of Luck\"), by Enrico Faccini and Augusto Macchetto, first published on March 24, 1998. In this story, the Goddess takes mortal guise in order to be able to date her favorite gander, and appears to be love-struck with him.\n\nHis exact relation to the Duck Family Tree at it's early stages was somewhat uncertain. In Carl Barks' original version of the family tree from the 1950s, Gladstone was the son of [[Luke the Goose]] and [[Daphne Duck]] who died by overeating at a free-lunch picnic. He was later adopted by [[Matilda McDuck]] and [[Goosetave Gander]]. Later, Barks is reported to have done away with the adoption, which was never featured in any story. (Of course, no stories denying the event were published.) In a more recent version of the family tree created by Don Rosa, with input from Barks, it was established that Daphne Duck (Donald's paternal aunt) married [[Goostave Gander]] and the two were Gladstone's parents. This is consistent with what Gladstone says in \"Race to the South Seas\": \"Scrooge McDuck is my mother's brother's brother-in-law\".\n\nGladstone has a nephew named '''Shamrock Gladstone''' who shares his propensity for luck.<ref>Dell Four Color #649</ref>\n\n== Animation ==\n[[File:GladstoneDuckTales1987.jpg|left|thumb|Gladstone Gander in DuckTales 1987, \"Dime Enough for Luck\".]]\n[[File:GladstoneDuckTales2017.jpg|thumb|207x207px|Gladstone Gander as he appears in DuckTales 2017.]]\nGladstone makes two speaking appearances in the [[animated series]] ''[[DuckTales]]'', where he was voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]. In these episodes he isn't characterized as much of a braggart he is in the comics but rather focusing much more on his care-free nature, and additionally acting a bit more foolishly. In the episode \"Dime Enough for Luck\", Gladstone is an unwitting stooge for [[Magica De Spell]] in one of her attempts to steal Scrooge's [[Number One Dime]]. He returns in the episode \"[[Dr. Jekyll & Mr. McDuck]]\", where he accidentally bids on an item that turns out to be valuable. This inspires Scrooge to bid on the next item\u2014a trunk containing Dr. Jekyll's formula\u2014which sets the plot in motion. He also makes non-speaking cameo appearances in the episodes \"[[Sweet Duck of Youth]]\" and \"[[Till Nephews Do Us Part]]\", as well in episode of ''[[House of Mouse]]'' \"Goofy For A Day\". Gladstone appears in the 2000 computer game [[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]] in his traditional role of Donald's rival for Daisy's affection, and every time a Boss Battle is about to start, Gladstone greets Donald, but always gets hurt, becoming squished by a giant bird, getting knocked off a building by a wrecking ball, being sent crashing to the bottom of a haunted mansion, and even gets sent back to Duckburg inside a pipe, and every time he gets hurt, he keeps saying that he's found a nickel. He also appears in the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]], first appearing in the episode \"The House of the Lucky Gander!\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/ducktales/268241/ducktales-episode-6-review-the-house-of-the-lucky-gander|title=DuckTales Episode 6 Review: The House Of The Lucky Gander!|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> In this series he is voiced by [[Paul F.

A [[Glossary of geology#M|massive]] fine-grained white or lightly tinted variety of gypsum, called [[alabaster]], has been used for [[sculpture]] by many cultures including [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Nottingham alabaster]]s of [[Medieval England]]. [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], based on [[Scratch hardness|scratch]] [[hardness comparison]], defines hardness value 2 as gypsum. It forms as an [[evaporite]] mineral and as a hydration product of [[anhydrite]].\n\n==Etymology and history==\n\nThe word gypsum is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word \u03b3\u03cd\u03c8\u03bf\u03c2 (''gypsos''), \"plaster\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/gypsum|title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary: gypsum}}</ref> Because the [[quarry|quarries]] of the [[Montmartre]] district of [[Paris]] have long furnished burnt gypsum ([[calcination|calcined]] gypsum) used for various purposes, this dehydrated gypsum became known as [[plaster of Paris]]. Upon addition of water, after a few tens of minutes plaster of Paris becomes regular gypsum (dihydrate) again, causing the material to harden or \"set\" in ways that are useful for casting and construction.\n\nGypsum was known in Old English as ''sp\u00e6rst\u0101n'', \"spear stone\", referring to its crystalline projections. (Thus, the word [[Spar (mineralogy)|spar]] in mineralogy is by way of comparison to gypsum, referring to any non-ore mineral or crystal that forms in spearlike projections).  In the mid-18th century, the German clergyman and agriculturalist [[Johann Friedrich Mayer (agriculturist)|Johann Friderich Mayer]] investigated and publicized gypsum's use as a fertilizer.<ref>See:\n*  {{cite book |last1=Thaer |first1=Albrecht Daniel |last2=Shaw |first2=William, trans. |last3=Johnson |first3=Cuthbert W., trans. |title=The Principles of Agriculture |date=1844 |publisher=Ridgway |location=London, England |volume= vol. 1 |pages=519\u2013520 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAhJAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA519#v=onepage&q&f=false}}\n*  {{NDB|16|544|545|Mayer, Johann Friedrich|Klaus Herrmann|104138432}}  From p. 544:  ''\" \u2026 er bewirtschaftete nebenbei ein Pfarrg\u00fcttchen, \u2026 f\u00fcr die D\u00fcngung der Felder mit dem in den nahen Waldenburger Bergen gefundenen Gips einsetzte.\"'' ( \u2026 he also managed a small parson's estate, on which he repeatedly conducted agricultural experiments.

Other forms of scaling, such as [[calcite]] scaling, depending on the water source, can also be important considerations in [[distillation]], as well as in [[heat exchanger]]s, where either the salt [[solubility]] or [[concentration]] can change rapidly.\n\nA new study has suggested that the formation of gypsum starts as tiny crystals of a mineral called [[bassanite]] (CaSO<sub>4</sub>\u00b70.5H<sub>2</sub>O).<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Van Driessche\n| first1 = A.E.S.\n| first2 = L.

For the [[circulatory system]] and [[bone marrow]] in which cells can occur in a liquid suspension and not bound up in solid [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], it makes sense for them to communicate by soluble, circulating protein [[molecule]]s.   However, as different lines of research converged, it became clear that some of the same signaling proteins which the hematopoietic and immune systems use were also being used by all sorts of other cells and tissues, during development and in the mature organism.\n\nWhile ''growth factor'' implies a positive effect on cell division, ''cytokine'' is a neutral term with respect to whether a molecule affects proliferation.  While some cytokines can be growth factors, such as [[Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor|G-CSF]] and [[Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor|GM-CSF]], others have an inhibitory effect on cell growth or proliferation. Some cytokines, such as [[Fas ligand]], are used as \"death\" signals; they cause target cells to undergo programmed [[cell death]] or ''[[apoptosis]]''.\n\nThe growth factor was first discovered by [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], which won her a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].\n\n== Classes ==\n{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}\nIndividual growth factor proteins tend to occur as members of larger families of structurally and [[evolution]]arily related proteins.

Most of his books and papers are in Latin sine flexione, others are in Italian.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Peano - Aritmetica generale e algebra elementare, 1902 - 3935060.tif |thumb|''Aritmetica generale e algebra elementare'', 1902]]\nPeano was born and raised on a farm at Spinetta, a hamlet now belonging to [[Cuneo]], [[Piedmont]], [[Italy]]. He attended the [[Liceo classico Cavour]] in [[Turin]], and enrolled at the [[University of Turin]] in 1876, graduating in 1880 with high honors, after which the University employed him to assist first [[Enrico D'Ovidio]], and then [[Angelo Genocchi]], the Chair of [[calculus]]. Due to Genocchi's poor health, Peano took over the teaching of calculus course within two years. His first major work, a textbook on calculus, was published in 1884 and was credited to Genocchi. A few years later, Peano published his first book dealing with mathematical logic. Here the modern symbols for the [[union (set theory)|union]] and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of sets appeared for the first time.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Richard N.

Schoenstatt webpage</ref> In 1886, he began teaching concurrently at the [[Royal Military Academy (Italy)|Royal Military Academy]], and was promoted to Professor First Class in 1889. In that year he published the [[Peano axioms]], a formal foundation for the collection of [[natural number]]s. The next year, the University of Turin also granted him his full professorship. Peano's famous [[space-filling curve]] appeared in 1890 as a [[counterexample]]. He used it to show that a continuous curve cannot always be enclosed in an arbitrarily small region. This was an early example of what came to be known as a [[fractal]].\n\nIn 1890 Peano founded the journal ''Rivista di Matematica'', which published its first issue in January 1891.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ziwet, Alexander|title=A New Italian Mathematical Journal|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1891|volume=1|issue=2|pages=42\u201343|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1891-01-02/S0002-9904-1891-00023-1/|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1891-00023-1}}</ref> In 1891 Peano started the [[Formulario Project]]. It was to be an \"Encyclopedia of Mathematics\", containing all known formulae and theorems of mathematical science using a standard notation invented by Peano. In 1897, the first [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] was held in [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Peano was a key participant, presenting a paper on mathematical logic. He also started to become increasingly occupied with ''Formulario'' to the detriment of his other work.\n\nIn 1898 he presented a note to the Academy about [[Binary numeral system|binary numeration]] and its ability to be used to represent the sounds of languages. He also became so frustrated with publishing delays (due to his demand that formulae be printed on one line) that he purchased a printing press.\n\n[[Paris]] was the venue for the Second [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1900. The conference was preceded by the First [[International Conference of Philosophy]] where Peano was a member of the patronage committee. He presented a paper which posed the question of correctly formed definitions in mathematics, ''i.e.'' \"how do you define a definition?\". This became one of Peano's main philosophical interests for the rest of his life. At the conference Peano met [[Bertrand Russell]] and gave him a copy of ''Formulario''. Russell was so struck by Peano's innovative logical symbols that he left the conference and returned home to study Peano's text.\n\nPeano's students [[Mario Pieri]] and [[Alessandro Padoa]] had papers presented at the philosophy congress also. For the mathematical congress, Peano did not speak, but Padoa's memorable presentation has been frequently recalled. A resolution calling for the formation of an \"international auxiliary language\" to facilitate the spread of mathematical (and commercial) ideas, was proposed; Peano fully supported it.\n\nBy 1901, Peano was at the peak of his mathematical career. He had made advances in the areas of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], foundations and logic, made many contributions to the teaching of calculus and also contributed to the fields of [[differential equation]]s and [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] analysis. Peano played a key role in the [[axiomatization]] of mathematics and was a leading pioneer in the development of mathematical logic. Peano had by this stage become heavily involved with the ''Formulario'' project and his teaching began to suffer. In fact, he became so determined to teach his new mathematical symbols that the calculus in his course was neglected. As a result, he was dismissed from the Royal Military Academy but retained his post at Turin University.\n\nIn 1903 Peano announced his work on an international auxiliary language called ''[[Latino sine flexione]]'' (\"[[Latin]] without inflexion,\" later called Interlingua, and the precursor of the [[Interlingua]] of the [[International Auxiliary Language Association|IALA]]). This was an important project for him (along with finding contributors for 'Formulario'). The idea was to use Latin vocabulary, since this was widely known, but simplify the grammar as much as possible and remove all irregular and anomalous forms to make it easier to learn. On 3rd January 1908, he read a paper to the  <i>Academia delle Scienze di Torino</i> in which he started speaking in Latin and, as he described each simplification, introduced it into his speech so that by the end he was talking in his new language.<ref>Bodmer, Frederick (1944), ''The Loom of Language'', London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd, p.468</ref>\n\nThe year 1908 was important for Peano. The fifth and final edition of the ''Formulario'' project, titled ''[[Formulario Mathematico]]'', was published. It contained 4200 formulae and theorems, all completely stated and most of them proved. The book received little attention since much of the content was dated by this time. However, it remains a significant contribution to mathematical literature. The comments and examples were written in ''Latino sine flexione''.\n\nAlso in 1908, Peano took over the chair of higher analysis at Turin (this appointment was to last for only two years). He was elected the director of ''[[Academia pro Interlingua]]''. Having previously created [[Idiom Neutral]], the Academy effectively chose to abandon it in favor of Peano's [[Latino sine flexione]].\n\nAfter his mother died in 1910, Peano divided his time between teaching, working on texts aimed for secondary schooling including a dictionary of mathematics, and developing and promoting his and other [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary language]]s, becoming a revered member of the international auxiliary language movement. He used his membership of the ''[[Accademia dei Lincei]]'' to present papers written by friends and colleagues who were not members (the Accademia recorded and published all presented papers given in sessions).\n\nDuring the years 1913\u20131918, Peano published several papers that dealt with the remainder term for various [[numerical integration|numerical quadrature]] formulas, and introduced the [[Peano kernel]].<ref name=numericalMath>{{Cite book| last1=H\u00e4mmerlin | first1 = G\u00fcnther | last2=Hoffmann | first2= Karl-Heinz|title = Numerical Mathematics | publisher = Springer | year = 1991 | pages = 192\u2013194 | isbn = 9780387974941}}</ref>\n\nIn 1925 Peano switched Chairs unofficially from Infinitesimal Calculus to Complementary Mathematics, a field which better suited his current style of mathematics. This move became official in 1931. Giuseppe Peano continued teaching at Turin University until the day before he died, when he suffered a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].\n\n==Milestones and honors received==\n* 1881: Published first paper.\n* 1884: [https://archive.org/details/calcolodifferen00peangoog ''Calcolo Differenziale e Principii di Calcolo Integrale''].\n* 1887: [https://archive.org/details/applicazionigeo00peangoog ''Applicazioni Geometriche del Calcolo Infinitesimale''].\n* 1889: Appointed Professor First Class at the Royal Military Academy.\n* 1889: [https://archive.org/details/arithmeticespri00peangoog ''Arithmetices principia: nova methodo exposita'']\n* 1890: Appointed Extraordinary Professor of [[infinitesimal calculus]] at the [[University of Turin]].\n* 1891: Made a member of the Academy of Science, Torino.\n* 1893: [https://archive.org/details/lezionidianalis00peangoog ''Lezioni di Analisi Infinitesimale''], 2 vols.\n* 1895: Promoted to Ordinary Professor.\n* 1901: Made Knight of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus|Order of Saints Maurizio and Lazzaro]].\n* 1903: Announces ''[[Latino sine flexione]]''.\n* 1905: Made Knight of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]].

It was defined in [[Joseph Gwilt]]'s ''Architecture'' (1859) as \"a piece of steel of a semi-cylindrical form, hollow on one side, having a cross handle at one end and a worm or screw at the other\".<ref>[[Joseph Gwilt]] (1859), ''Architecture''</ref> \n\nA gimlet is always a small tool. A similar tool of larger size is called an [[auger (drill)|auger]]. The cutting action of the gimlet is slightly different from an auger, however, as the end of the screw, and so the initial hole it makes, is smaller; the cutting edges pare away the wood which is moved out by the spiral sides, falling out through the entry hole. This also pulls the gimlet farther into the hole as it is turned; unlike a [[bradawl]], pressure is not required once the tip has been drawn in. \n\nThe name \"gimlet\" comes from the [[Old French]] ''guinbelet'', ''guimbelet'', later ''guibelet'', probably a diminutive of the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] \"wimble\",  a variation of \"guimble\", from the Middle Low German ''wiemel'', cf. the [[Scandinavia]]n ''wammie'', to bore or twist. Modern French uses the term ''vrille'', also the French for a tendril.<ref>''[[OED|Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd. Edition, (1989)</ref>\n\n==Use as a metaphor ==\nThe term is also used figuratively to describe something as sharp or piercing, and also to describe the twisting, boring motion of using a gimlet. The term ''gimlet-eyed'' can mean sharp-eyed or squint-eyed (one example of this use is [[Smedley Butler|Major General Smedley Darlington Butler]], who was known as \"Old Gimlet Eye\").\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adamson, John, \"Gimlets galore!\", ''Furniture & Cabinetmaking'', no. 265, Winter 2017, pp. 50\u20133\n* [[Ken Hawley|Hawley, Ken]], & Watts, Dennis (2017), ''Gimlet Patterns and Manufacture'' Sheffield: The Hawley Collection Trust Ltd in association with the [[Tools and Trades History Society]] {{ISBN|9780947673253}} {{OCLC|985584991}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Woodworking}}\n{{Hand tools}}\n\n[[Category:Woodworking hand tools]]\n[[Category:Hole making]]\n\n[[de:Bohrer#Nagelbohrer]]", "sha1": "je3mo5tdky7qb230mtqxh1nz4sxkmo4"}}, {"title": "Geometric mean", "ns": "0", "id": "13046", "revision": {"id": "865245779", "parentid": "862650725", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T17:59:37Z", "contributor": {"username": "TJRana", "id": "15173685"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Aspect ratios */ Fixing style/layout errors", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{More citations needed|article|date=May 2010}}\n[[File:01-Mittlere Proportionale.gif|thumb|400px|Construction geometric mean/ mean proportional,<ref>Matt Friehauf, Mikaela Hertel, Juan Liu, and Stacey Luong {{cite web|url=https://sites.math.washington.edu/~julia/teaching/445_Spring2013/ConstructionsI.pdf#page=6&zoom=80,-502,802 |title=On Compass and Straightedge Constructions: Means|publisher=UNIVERSITY of WASHINGTON, DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS|year=2013 |accessdate=14 June 2018}}</ref><ref>Euclid, Book VI, Proposition 13</ref> in an example in which the line segment <math>l_2\\;(\\overline{BC})</math> is given as a perpendicular to <math>\\overline{AB}</math>.]]\n\nIn mathematics, the '''geometric mean''' is a [[mean]] or [[average]], which indicates the central tendency or typical value of a set of numbers by using the product of their values (as opposed to the [[arithmetic mean]] which uses their sum). The geometric mean is defined as the [[Nth root|{{math|''n''}}th root]] of the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of {{mvar|n}} numbers, i.e., for a set of numbers {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>''}}, the geometric mean is defined as\n\n:<math>\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\\right)^\\frac{1}{n} = \\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n}</math>\n\nFor instance, the geometric mean of two numbers, say 2 and 8, is just the [[square root]] of their product, that is, <math>\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 8} = 4</math>. As another example, the geometric mean of the three numbers 4, 1, and 1/32 is the [[cube root]] of their product (1/8), which is 1/2, that is, <math>\\sqrt[3]{4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1/32} = 1/2</math>.\n\nA geometric mean is often used when comparing different items\u2014finding a single \"figure of merit\" for these items\u2014when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges.<ref>{{cite web|title=TPC-D \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|url=http://www.tpc.org/tpcd/faq.asp#anchor1140017|publisher=Transaction Processing Performance Council|accessdate=9 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104224323/http://www.tpc.org/tpcd/faq.asp#anchor1140017|archivedate=4 November 2011|df=}}</ref> For example, the geometric mean can give a meaningful \"average\" to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability, and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability. If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger\u2014so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5). The use of a geometric mean \"normalizes\" the ranges being averaged, so that no range dominates the weighting, and a given percentage change in any of the properties has the same effect on the geometric mean. So, a 20% change in environmental sustainability from 4 to 4.8 has the same effect on the geometric mean as a 20% change in financial viability from 60 to 72.\n\nThe geometric mean can be understood in terms of [[geometry]]. The geometric mean of two numbers, <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, is the length of one side of a [[square (geometry)|square]] whose area is equal to the area of a [[rectangle]] with sides of lengths <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>. Similarly, the geometric mean of three numbers, <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math>, is the length of one edge of a [[cube]] whose volume is the same as that of a [[cuboid]] with sides whose lengths are equal to the three given numbers.\n\nThe geometric mean applies only to positive numbers.<ref>The geometric mean only applies to numbers of the same sign in order to avoid taking the root of a negative product, which would result in [[imaginary number]]s, and also to satisfy certain properties about means, which is explained later in the article. The definition is unambiguous if one allows 0 (which yields a geometric mean of 0), but may be excluded, as one frequently wishes to take the logarithm of geometric means (to convert between multiplication and addition), and one cannot take the logarithm of 0.</ref> It is also often used for a set of numbers whose values are meant to be multiplied together or are exponential in nature, such as data on the growth of the [[World population|human population]] or interest rates of a financial investment.\n\nThe geometric mean is also one of the three classical [[Pythagorean means]], together with the aforementioned arithmetic mean and the [[harmonic mean]]. For all positive data sets containing at least one pair of unequal values, the harmonic mean is always the least of the three means, while the arithmetic mean is always the greatest of the three and the geometric mean is always in between (see [[Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]].)\n\n==Calculation==\nThe geometric mean of a data set <math display=\"inline\">\\left\\{a_1, a_2,\\, \\ldots,\\, a_n\\right\\}</math> is given by:\n:<math>\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \\right)^\\frac{1}{n} = \\sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n}.</math>\n\nThe above figure uses [[capital pi notation]] to show a series of multiplications.  Each side of the equal sign shows that a set of values is multiplied in succession (the number of values is represented by \"n\") to give a total [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the set, and then the ''n''th root of the total product is taken to give the geometric mean of the original set.  For example, in a set of four numbers <math display=\"inline\">\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}</math>, the product of <math display=\"inline\">1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4</math> is <math display=\"inline\">24</math>, and the geometric mean is the fourth root of 24, or ~ 2.213.  The exponent <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{1}{n}</math> on the left side is equivalent to the taking ''n''th root.  For example, <math display=\"inline\">24^\\frac{1}{4} = \\sqrt[4]{24}</math>.\n\nThe geometric mean of a data set [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means|is less than]] the data set's [[arithmetic mean]] unless all members of the data set are equal, in which case the geometric and arithmetic means are equal. This allows the definition of the [[arithmetic-geometric mean]], an intersection of the two which always lies in between.\n\nThe geometric mean is also the '''arithmetic-harmonic mean''' in the sense that if two [[sequence]]s (<math display=\"inline\">a_n</math>) and (<math display=\"inline\">h_n</math>) are defined:\n:<math>a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_n + h_n}{2}, \\quad a_0 = x</math>\n\nand\n:<math>h_{n+1} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{a_n} + \\frac{1}{h_n}}, \\quad h_0 = y</math>\n\nwhere <math display=\"inline\">h_{n+1}</math> is the [[harmonic mean]] of the previous values of the two sequences, then <math display=\"inline\">a_n</math> and <math display=\"inline\">h_n</math> will converge to the geometric mean of <math display=\"inline\">x</math> and <math display=\"inline\">y</math>.\n\nThis can be seen easily from the fact that the sequences do converge to a common limit (which can be shown by [[Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem]]) and the fact that geometric mean is preserved:\n:<math>\\sqrt{a_i h_i} =\n  \\sqrt{\\frac{a_i + h_i}{\\frac{a_i + h_i}{h_i a_i}}} =\n  \\sqrt{\\frac{a_i + h_i}{\\frac{1}{a_i} + \\frac{1}{h_i}}} =\n  \\sqrt{a_{i+1} h_{i+1}}\n</math>\n\nReplacing the arithmetic and harmonic mean by a pair of [[generalized mean]]s of opposite, finite exponents yields the same result.\n\n==={{anchor|Log-average}}Relationship with logarithms ===<!--\"Log-average\" redirects here-->\nThe geometric mean can also be expressed as the exponential of the arithmetic mean of logarithms.<ref>{{cite book |title=Statistics: An Introduction using R |first=Michael J. |last=Crawley |publisher=John Wiley & Sons Ltd. |year=2005 |isbn=9780470022986 }}</ref> By using [[logarithmic identities]] to transform the formula, the multiplications can be expressed as a sum and the power as a multiplication:\n: When <math>a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n > 0</math>\n:: <math>\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \\right)^\\frac{1}{n} = \\exp\\left[\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln a_i\\right]</math> \n: if <math>\\exists a_j < 0</math> then\n:: <math>\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \\right)^\\frac{1}{n} = \\left(-1\\right)^m \\exp\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln \\left|a_i\\right| \\right]</math>  \n: Where m is the number of negative numbers.\n\nThis is sometimes called the '''log-average''' (not to be confused with the [[logarithmic average]]).  It is simply computing the [[arithmetic mean]] of the logarithm-transformed values of <math>a_i</math> (i.e., the arithmetic mean on the log scale) and then using the exponentiation to return the computation to the original scale, i.e., it is the [[generalised f-mean]] with <math>f(x) = \\log x</math>. For example, the geometric mean of 2 and 8 can be calculated as the following, where <math>b</math> is any base of a [[logarithm]] (commonly 2, [[e (mathematical constant)|<math>e</math>]] or 10):\n:<math>b^{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\log_b (2) + \\log_b (8)\\right]} = 4</math>\n\nThe log form of the geometric mean is generally the preferred alternative for implementation in computer languages because calculating the product of many numbers can lead to an [[arithmetic overflow]] or [[arithmetic underflow]]. This is less likely to occur with the sum of the logarithms for each number.\n\n===Relationship with arithmetic mean and mean-preserving spread===\n\nIf a set of non-identical numbers is subjected to a [[mean-preserving spread]] \u2014 that is, two or more elements of the set are \"spread apart\" from each other while leaving the arithmetic mean unchanged \u2014 then the geometric mean always decreases.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mitchell |first=Douglas W. |title=More on spreads and non-arithmetic means |journal=[[The Mathematical Gazette]] |volume=88 |year=2004 |pages=142\u2013144 }}</ref>\n\n===Computation in constant time===\nIn cases where the geometric mean is being used to determine the average growth rate of some quantity, and the initial and final values <math>a_0</math> and <math>a_n</math> of that quantity are known, the product of the measured growth rate at every step need not be taken.{{citation needed|reason=What is the proof of this?|date=July 2016}}  Instead, the geometric mean is simply\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{a_n}{a_0}\\right)^\\frac{1}{n},</math>\n\nwhere <math>n</math> is the number of steps from the initial to final state.\n\nIf the values are <math>a_0,\\, \\ldots,\\, a_n</math>, then the growth rate between measurement <math>a_k</math> and <math>a_{k+1}</math> is <math>a_{k+1}/a_k</math>.

In this scenario, using the arithmetic or harmonic mean would change the ranking of the results depending on what is used as a reference.  For example, take the following comparison of execution time of computer programs:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! &nbsp; !! Computer A !! Computer B !!

In general, it is more rigorous to assign weights to each of the programs, calculate the average weighted execution time (using the arithmetic mean), and then normalize that result to one of the computers. The three tables above just give a different weight to each of the programs, explaining the inconsistent results of the arithmetic and harmonic means (the first table gives equal weight to both programs, the second gives a weight of 1/1000 to the second program, and the third gives a weight of 1/100 to the second program and 1/10 to the first one). The use of the geometric mean for aggregating performance numbers should be avoided if possible, because multiplying execution times has no physical meaning, in contrast to adding times as in the arithmetic mean. Metrics that are inversely proportional to time (speedup, [[Instructions per cycle|IPC]]) should be averaged using the harmonic mean.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Proportional growth===\n{{Further|Compound annual growth rate}}\nThe geometric mean is more appropriate than the [[arithmetic mean]] for describing proportional growth, both [[exponential growth]] (constant proportional growth) and varying growth; in business the geometric mean of growth rates is known as the [[compound annual growth rate]] (CAGR). The geometric mean of growth over periods yields the equivalent constant growth rate that would yield the same final amount.\n\nSuppose an orange tree yields 100 oranges one year and then 180, 210 and 300 the following years, so the growth is 80%, 16.6666% and 42.8571% for each year respectively. Using the [[arithmetic mean]] calculates a (linear) average growth of 46.5079% (80% + 16.6666% + 42.8571%, that sum then divided by 3). However, if we start with 100 oranges and let it grow 46.5079% each year, the result is 314 oranges, not 300, so the linear average ''over''-states the year-on-year growth.\n\nInstead, we can use the geometric mean. Growing with 80% corresponds to multiplying with 1.80, so we take the geometric mean of 1.80, 1.166666 and 1.428571, i.e. <math>\\sqrt[3]{1.80 \\times 1.166666 \\times 1.428571} \\approx 1.442249</math>; thus the \"average\" growth per year is 44.2249%. If we start with 100 oranges and let the number grow with 44.2249% each year, the result is 300 oranges.\n\n===Applications in the social sciences===\n\nAlthough the geometric mean has been relatively rare in computing social statistics, starting from 2010 the United Nations Human Development Index did switch to this mode of calculation, on the grounds that it better reflected the non-substitutable nature of the statistics being compiled and compared:\n: The geometric mean decreases the level of substitutability between dimensions [being compared] and at the same time ensures that a 1 percent decline in say life expectancy at birth has the same impact on the HDI as a 1 percent decline in education or income. Thus, as a basis for comparisons of achievements, this method is also more respectful of the intrinsic differences across the dimensions than a simple average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/faq/|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Human Development Reports|author=|date=|website=hdr.undp.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302103418/http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/faq/|archivedate=2011-03-02|df=}}</ref>\n\nNot all values used to compute the [[Human Development Index|HDI (Human Development Index)]] are normalized; some of them instead have the form <math>\\left(X - X_\\text{min}\\right) / \\left(X_\\text{norm} - X_\\text{min}\\right)</math>. This makes the choice of the geometric mean less obvious than one would expect from the \"Properties\" section above.\n\n===Aspect ratios===\n[[File:Dr. Kerns Powers, SMPTE derivation of 16-9 aspect ratio.svg|thumb|right|Equal area comparison of the aspect ratios used by Kerns Powers to derive the [[SMPTE]] [[16:9]] standard.<ref name=\"Cinemasource\" /> {{colorbox|red}}{{nbsp}}TV 4:3/1.33 in red, {{colorbox|orange}}{{nbsp}}1.66 in orange, {{colorbox|blue}}{{nbsp}}'''16:9/1.7{{overline|7}} in blue''', {{colorbox|#aaaa00}}{{nbsp}}1.85 in yellow, {{colorbox|mauve}}{{nbsp}}[[Panavision]]/2.2 in mauve and {{colorbox|purple}}{{nbsp}}[[CinemaScope]]/2.35 in purple.]]\nThe geometric mean has been used in choosing a compromise [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] in film and video: given two aspect ratios, the geometric mean of them provides a compromise between them, distorting or cropping both in some sense equally.

The intermediate ratios have no effect on the result, only the two extreme ratios.\n\nApplying the same geometric mean technique to 16:9 and 4:3 approximately yields the [[14:9]] (<math display=\"inline\">1.55\\overline{5}</math>...) aspect ratio, which is likewise used as a compromise between these ratios.<ref>{{cite patent | title = Method of showing 16:9 pictures on 4:3 displays | country = US | number = 5956091 | gdate = September 21, 1999 }}</ref> In this case 14:9 is exactly the ''[[arithmetic mean]]'' of <math display=\"inline\">16:9</math> and <math display=\"inline\">4:3 = 12:9</math>, since 14 is the average of 16 and 12, while the precise ''geometric mean'' is <math display=\"inline\">\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{9}\\times\\frac{4}{3}} \\approx 1.5396 \\approx 13.8:9,</math> but the two different ''means'', arithmetic and geometric, are approximately equal because both numbers are sufficiently close to each other (a difference of less than 2%).\n\n===Anti-reflective coatings===\nIn optical coatings, where reflection needs to be minimised between two media of refractive indices ''n''<sub>0</sub> and ''n''<sub>2</sub>, the optimum refractive index ''n''<sub>1</sub> of the [[anti-reflective coating]] is given by the geometric mean: <math>n_1 = \\sqrt{n_0 n_2}</math>.\n\n===Spectral flatness===\nIn [[signal processing]], [[spectral flatness]], a measure of how flat or spiky a spectrum is, is defined as the ratio of the geometric mean of the power spectrum to its arithmetic mean.\n\n===Geometry===\n{{right_angle_altitude.svg}}\nIn the case of a [[right triangle]], its altitude is the length of a line extending perpendicularly from the hypotenuse to its 90\u00b0 vertex.

The [[semi-major axis]] of an ellipse is the geometric mean of the distance from the center to either focus and the distance from the center to either [[Directrix (conic section)|directrix]].\n\nDistance to the [[horizon]] of a [[sphere]] is the geometric mean of the distance to the closest point of the sphere and the distance to the farthest point of the sphere.\n\nBoth in the approximation of [[squaring the circle#Modern approximative constructions|squaring the circle according to S.A.

She authored seven novels, including [[Adam Bede]] (1859), [[The Mill on the Floss]] (1860), [[Silas Marner]] (1861), [[Romola]] (1862-63), [[Middlemarch]] (1871\u201372), and [[Daniel Deronda]] (1876), most of which are set in provincial England and known for their [[realism (arts)|realism]]  and psychological insight.{{fact|date=June 2018}}\n\nEvans used a male pen name, she said, to ensure that her works would be taken seriously.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Eliot|title=George Eliot {{!}} British author|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en}}</ref> Although female authors were published under their own names during her lifetime, she wanted to escape the stereotype of women's writing being limited to lighthearted romances. She also wanted to have her fiction judged separately from her already extensive and widely known work as an editor and critic.

She was the third child of Robert Evans (1773\u20131849) and Christiana Evans (''n\u00e9e'' Pearson, 1788\u20131836), the daughter of a local mill-owner. Mary Ann's name was sometimes shortened to Marian.<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/collections/projects/eliot/middlemarch/bio.html#mary University of Virginia] According to a University of Virginia research forum published here, her baptismal records record the spelling as Mary-Anne, and she uses this spelling in her earliest letters. Around 1857, she began to use Mary Ann. In 1859, she was using Marian, but she reverted to Mary Ann in 1880.  {{cite web |url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/collections/projects/eliot/middlemarch/bio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823054834/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/collections/projects/eliot/middlemarch/bio.html#mary |archivedate=23 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Her full siblings were Christiana, known as Chrissey (1814\u201359), Isaac (1816\u20131890), and twin brothers who survived a few days in March 1821. She also had a half-brother, Robert (1802\u201364), and half-sister, Fanny (1805\u201382), from her father's previous marriage to Harriet Poynton (?1780\u20131809). Her father Robert Evans, of Welsh ancestry, was the manager of the [[Arbury Hall]] Estate for the [[Newdigate family]] in Warwickshire, and Mary Ann was born on the estate at South Farm. In early 1820 the family moved to a house named [[Griff House]], between [[Nuneaton]] and [[Bedworth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Du-Fi/Eliot-George.html|title=George Eliot Biography - life, childhood, children, name, story, death, history, wife, school, young|website=www.notablebiographies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}</ref>\n\nThe young Evans was obviously intelligent, a voracious reader. Because she was not considered physically beautiful, Evans was not thought to have much chance of marriage, and because of her intelligence, her father invested in an education not often afforded women.<ref>Karl, Frederick R. ''George Eliot: Voice of a Century''. Norton, 1995. pp. 24\u201325</ref> From ages five to nine, she boarded with her sister Chrissey at Miss Latham's school in [[Attleborough, Warwickshire|Attleborough]], from ages nine to thirteen at Mrs. Wallington's school in Nuneaton, and from ages thirteen to sixteen at Miss Franklin's school in [[Coventry]]. At Mrs. Wallington's school, she was taught by the [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Maria Lewis \u2014 to whom her earliest surviving letters are addressed. In the religious atmosphere of the Miss Franklin's school, Evans was exposed to a quiet, disciplined belief opposed to evangelicalism.<ref>Karl, Frederick R. ''George Eliot: Voice of a Century''. Norton, 1995. p. 31</ref>\n\nAfter age sixteen, Evans had little formal education.<ref>Karl, Frederick R. George ''Eliot: Voice of a Century.''  Norton, 1995. p. 52</ref> Thanks to her father's important role on the estate, she was allowed access to the library of Arbury Hall, which greatly aided her self-education and breadth of learning. Her classical education left its mark; Christopher Stray has observed that \"George Eliot's novels draw heavily on Greek literature (only one of her books can be printed correctly without the use of a Greek typeface), and her themes are often influenced by Greek tragedy\".<ref>Christopher Stray ''Classics Transformed'', p. 81</ref> Her frequent visits to the estate also allowed her to contrast the wealth in which the local landowner lived with the lives of the often much poorer people on the estate, and different lives lived in parallel would reappear in many of her works. The other important early influence in her life was religion. She was brought up within a [[low church]] [[Anglican]] family, but at that time the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] was an area with a growing number of [[English Dissenters|religious dissenters]].\n\n=== Move to Coventry ===\nIn 1836 her mother died and Evans (then 16) returned home to act as housekeeper, but she continued correspondence with her tutor Maria Lewis. When she was 21, her brother Isaac married and took over the family home, so Evans and her father moved to [[Foleshill]] near [[Coventry]]. The closeness to Coventry society brought new influences, most notably those of Charles and Cara Bray. [[Charles Bray]] had become rich as a ribbon manufacturer and had used his wealth in the building of schools and in other philanthropic causes. Evans, who had been struggling with religious doubts for some time, became intimate friends with the radical, free-thinking Brays, whose \"Rosehill\" home was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. The people whom the young woman met at the Brays' house included [[Robert Owen]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Harriet Martineau]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Through this society Evans was introduced to more liberal and agnostic theologies and to writers such as [[David Strauss]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], who cast doubt on the literal truth of Biblical stories. In fact, her first major literary work was an English translation of Strauss's ''The Life of Jesus'' (1846), which she completed after it had been left incomplete by another member of the \"Rosehill Circle\"; later she translated Feuerbach\u2019s ''The Essence of Christianity'' (1854). As a product of their friendship, Bray published some of Evans's earliest writing, such as reviews, in his newspaper the ''[[Coventry Herald and Observer]]''.<ref name = Eliot>{{cite journal |title=George Eliot's Earliest Prose: The Coventry \"Herald\" and the Coventry Fiction |first=Kathleen |last=McCormick |journal=Victorian Periodicals Review |volume=19 |number=2 |date=Summer 1986 |pages=57\u201362 |jstor =20082202}}</ref>\n\nWhen Evans began to question her religious faith, her father threatened to throw her out of the house, but his threat was not carried out. Instead, she respectfully attended church and continued to keep house for him until his death in 1849, when she was 30. Five days after her father's funeral, she travelled to Switzerland with the Brays. She decided to stay on in [[Geneva]] alone, living first on the lake at Plongeon (near the present-day United Nations buildings) and then on the second floor of a house owned by her friends Fran\u00e7ois and Juliet d'Albert Durade on the rue de Chanoines (now the rue de la Pelisserie). She commented happily that \"one feels in a downy nest high up in a good old tree\". Her stay is commemorated by a plaque on the building. While residing there, she read avidly and took long walks in the beautiful Swiss countryside, which was a great inspiration to her. Fran\u00e7ois Durade painted her portrait there as well.<ref>Hardy BN. ''George Elliot: A Critic's Biography''. Continuum. London 2006 pp42-45.</ref>\n\n=== Move to London and editorship of the ''Westminster Review'' ===\nOn her return to England the following year (1850), she moved to London with the intent of becoming a writer, and she began referring to herself as Marian Evans. She stayed at the house of [[John Chapman (publisher)|John Chapman]], the radical publisher whom she had met earlier at Rosehill and who had published her Strauss translation. Chapman had recently purchased the campaigning, left-wing journal ''[[The Westminster Review]]'', and Evans became its assistant editor in 1851. Although Chapman was officially the editor, it was Evans who did most of the work of producing the journal, contributing many essays and reviews beginning with the January 1852 issue and continuing until the end of her employment at the Review in the first half of 1854.<ref>Ashton, Rosemary. ''George Eliot: A Life''. London: Penguin, 1997. 88ff. p110.</ref> Eliot sympathized with the [[1848 Revolutions]] throughout continental Europe, and even hoped that the Italians would chase the \"odious Austrians\" out of Lombard and that \"decayed monarchs\" would be pensioned off, although she believed a gradual reformist approach to social problems was best for England.<ref name=\"Fleishman\" /><ref name=\"June\" /> \n\nWomen writers were common at the time, but Evans's role as the female editor of a literary magazine was quite unusual. During this period, she formed a number of unreciprocated emotional attachments, including one with Chapman (who was married but lived with both his wife and his mistress), and another with [[Herbert Spencer]].\n\n=== Relationship with George Lewes ===\n[[File:George Eliot by Samuel Laurence.jpg|thumb|Portrait of George Eliot by [[Samuel Laurence]], c. 1860]]\n\nThe philosopher and critic [[George Henry Lewes]] (1817\u201378) met Evans in 1851, and by 1854 they had decided to live together. Lewes was already married to Agnes Jervis, although in an [[open marriage]]. In addition to the three children they had together, Agnes also had four children by [[Thornton Leigh Hunt]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Henry|first= Nancy|title= The Cambridge Introduction to George Eliot|year= 2008|publisher= Cambridge|location= Cambridge|pages=6}}</ref>  In July 1854, Lewes and Evans travelled to [[Weimar]] and Berlin together for the purpose of research. Before going to Germany, Evans continued her theological work with a translation of Feuerbach's ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'', and while abroad she wrote essays and worked on her translation of [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', which she completed in 1856, but which was not published in her lifetime.<ref>Hughes, Kathryn, ''George Eliot: The Last Victorian'', p. 168.</ref>\n\nThe trip to Germany also served as a honeymoon for Evans and Lewes, and they now considered themselves married,  Evans calling herself Mary Ann Evans Lewes, and referring to Lewes as her husband. It was not unusual for men in Victorian society to have adulterous affairs; [[Charles Bray]], John Chapman, [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Wilkie Collins]] all had adulterous affairs, conducted with discretion. By contrast, Lewes and Evans declined to conceal their relationship, and it was this refusal which perhaps gave an additional edge to the reproaches of contemporary moralists.\n\n=== Career in fiction ===\nWhile continuing to contribute pieces to the ''Westminster Review'', Evans resolved to become a novelist, and set out a pertinent manifesto in one of her last essays for the ''Review'', \"Silly Novels by Lady Novelists\"<ref>[https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/silly-novels-by-lady-novelists-essay-by-george-eliot \"Silly Novels by Lady Novelists\"] text from ''The Westminster Review'' Vol. 66 old series, Vol. 10 new series (October 1856): 442\u201361.</ref> (1856). The essay criticised the trivial and ridiculous plots of contemporary fiction written by women. In other essays, she praised the [[realism (arts)|realism]] of novels that were being written in Europe at the time,  an emphasis on realistic storytelling confirmed in her own subsequent fiction. She also adopted a nom-de-plume, George Eliot. This pen-name has been said to be an homage to George Lewes, obviously in the first name, while the surname, Eliot, may have been a code for \"to L\u2014I owe it\".<ref>Mead, Rebecca, ''My Life in Middlemarch''. New York: Crown Publishers, 2014, p. 178</ref>\n\nIn 1857, when she was 37 years of age, \"The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton\", the first of the three stories comprising ''[[Scenes of Clerical Life]]'', and the first work of \"George Eliot\", was published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''. ''The Scenes'' (published as a book in 1858), was well received, and was widely believed to have been written by a country [[parson]], or perhaps the wife of a parson. Evans's first complete novel, published in 1859, was ''[[Adam Bede]]''. It was an instant success, and prompted yet more intense curiosity as to the author's identity: there was even a pretender to the authorship, one Joseph Liggins. This public interest subsequently led to Marian Evans Lewes's acknowledgment that it was she who stood behind the pseudonym George Eliot.\n\nThe revelations about Eliot's private life surprised and shocked many of her admiring readers, but this did not affect her popularity as a novelist. Her relationship with Lewes afforded her the encouragement and stability she needed to write fiction, but it would be some time before the couple were accepted into polite society. Acceptance was finally confirmed in 1877 when they were introduced to [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]], the daughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. The queen herself was an avid reader of all of Eliot's novels and was so impressed with ''Adam Bede'' that she commissioned the artist [[Edward Henry Corbould]] to paint scenes from the book.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/6794 Rosemary Ashton, \"Evans, Marian &#91;George Eliot&#93; (1819\u20131880)\"], (Later Works) ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004</ref>\n\n[[File:George Eliot 31 Wimbledon Park Road blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, Holly Lodge, 31 Wimbledon Park Road, London]]\nWhen the [[American Civil War]] broke out, Eliot expressed sympathy with the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]], which was a rare stance in England at the time.<ref name=\"Fleishman\">{{cite book |last1=Fleishman |first1=Avrom |title=George Eliot's Intellectual Life |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=140\u2013142}}</ref><ref name=\"June\">{{cite book |last1=Szirotny |first1=June |title=George Eliot's Feminism: The Right to Rebellion |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |pages=26\u201328}}</ref> In 1868 she supported [[Richard Congreve]]'s protests against Britain's imperial policy toward Ireland and her view of the growing movement in support of [[Irish Home Rule]] was positive.<ref name=\"Fleishman\" /><ref name=\"June\" /> \n\nShe was influenced by the writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] and read all of his major works as they were published.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleishman |first1=Avrom |title=George Eliot's Intellectual Life |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=59}}</ref> In Mill's ''Subjection of Women'' (1869)  she judged the second chapter excoriating the laws which oppress married women \"excellent.\"<ref name=\"June\" /> She was supportive of Mill's parliamentary run, but believed that the electorate was unlikely to vote for a philosopher and was surprised when he won.<ref name=\"Fleishman\" /> While Mill served in parliament, she expressed her agreement with Mill's efforts on behalf of female suffrage, being \"inclined to hope for much good from the serious presentation of women's claims before Parliament.\"<ref name=\"Newton\">{{cite book |last1=Newton |first1=K.

Within a year of completing ''Adam Bede'', she finished ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]'', dedicating the manuscript: \"To my beloved husband, George Henry Lewes, I give this MS. of my third book, written in the sixth year of our life together, at Holly Lodge, South Field, Wandsworth, and finished 21 March 1860.\"\n\nHer last novel was ''[[Daniel Deronda]]'', published in 1876, after which she and Lewes moved to [[Witley]], Surrey. By this time Lewes's health was failing, and he died two years later, on 30 November 1878. Eliot spent the next two years editing Lewes's final work, ''Life and Mind'', for publication, and found solace and companionship with [[John Walter Cross]], a Scottish commission agent<ref>1881 census</ref> 20 years her junior, whose mother had recently died.\n\n=== Marriage to John Cross and death ===\n[[File:Highgate Cemetery - East - George Eliot 01.jpg|thumb|Eliot's grave in [[Highgate Cemetery]]]]\n\nOn 16 May 1880 Eliot married John Cross and again changed her name, this time to Mary Anne Cross. Although the marriage courted some controversy due to the difference in ages. However it pleased her brother Isaac, who had broken off relations with her when she had begun to live with Lewes, and now sent congratulations.

He survived, and the newlyweds returned to England. They moved to a new house in Chelsea, but Eliot fell ill with a throat infection.

From ''[[Adam Bede]]'' to ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]'' and ''[[Silas Marner]]'', Eliot presented the cases of social outsiders and small-town persecution. ''[[Felix Holt, the Radical]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Jubal]]'' were overtly political, and political crisis is at the heart of ''[[Middlemarch]]'', in which she presents the stories of a number of inhabitants of a small English town on the eve of the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill of 1832]]; the novel is notable for its deep psychological insight and sophisticated character portraits. The roots of her realist philosophy can be found in her review of [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Modern Painters]]'' in ''[[Westminster Review]]'' in 1856.\n\nReaders in the Victorian era praised her novels for their depictions of rural society. Much of the material for her prose was drawn from her own experience. She shared with [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] the belief that there was much value and beauty to be found in the mundane details of ordinary country life. Eliot did not, however, confine herself to stories of the English countryside. ''[[Romola]]'', an historical novel set in late fifteenth century [[Florence]], was based on the life of the Italian priest [[Girolamo Savonarola]]. In ''The Spanish Gypsy'', Eliot made a foray into verse, but her poetry's initial popularity has not endured.\n\nWorking as a translator, Eliot was exposed to German texts of religious, social, and moral philosophy such as [[David Strauss|Friedrich Strauss]]\u2019s ''Life of Jesus'', Feuerbach\u2019s ''The Essence of Christianity'', and Spinoza\u2019s ''Ethics''. Elements from these works show up in her fiction, much of which is written with her trademark sense of [[agnostic]] [[humanism]]. She had taken particular notice of Feuerbach\u2019s conception of Christianity, positing that our understanding of the nature of the divine was to be found ultimately in the nature of humanity projected onto a divine figure. An example of this philosophy appeared in her novel ''Romola'', in which Eliot\u2019s protagonist displayed a \u201csurprisingly modern readiness to interpret religious language in humanist or secular ethical terms.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Companion to the Victorian Novel|last = Bidney|first = Martin|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = Westport|pages = 100\u2013101|editor-last = Baker|editor-first = William|chapter = Philosophy and the Victorian Literary Aesthetic|editor-last2 = Womack|editor-first2 = Kenneth}}</ref> Though Eliot herself was not religious, she had respect for religious tradition and its ability to maintain a sense of social order and morality. \nThe religious elements in her fiction also owe much to her upbringing, with the experiences of Maggie Tulliver from ''The Mill on the Floss'' sharing many similarities with the young Mary Ann Evans. Eliot also faced a quandary similar to that of Silas Marner, whose alienation from the church simultaneously meant his alienation from society. Because Eliot retained a vestigial respect for religion, German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] excoriated her system of morality for figuring sin as a debt that can be expiated through suffering, which he demeaned as characteristic of \"little moralistic females \u00e0 la Eliot.\"<ref>Thomas J. Joudrey. \"The Defects of Perfectionism: Nietzsche, Eliot, and the Irrevocability of Wrong.\" ''Philological Quarterly'' 96.1 (2017): 77-104.</ref>\n\nShe was at her most autobiographical in ''Looking Backwards'', part of her final published work ''[[Impressions of Theophrastus Such]]''. By the time of ''[[Daniel Deronda]]'', Eliot's sales were falling off, and she had faded from public view to some degree. This was not helped by the posthumous biography written by her husband, which portrayed a wonderful, almost saintly, woman totally at odds with the scandalous life people knew she had led. In the 20th century she was championed by a new breed of critics, most notably by [[Virginia Woolf]], who called ''Middlemarch'' \"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people\".<ref>Woolf, Virginia. \"George Eliot.\" ''The Common Reader''.

It is analogous to the \"[[Blue Screen of Death]]\" in [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems, or a [[kernel panic]] in [[Unix-like|Unix]].  It has later been used as a message for unrecoverable errors in software such as [[Varnish (software)|Varnish]]<ref name=\"varnish\">{{cite web|url=https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/troubleshooting.html#varnish-gives-me-guru-meditation|title=Varnish Troubleshooting: Varnish gives me Guru meditation|accessdate=2011-12-18}}</ref> and [[VirtualBox]].<ref name=\"VirtualBox\">{{cite web|url=https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=9373|title=What is guru meditation? (VirtualBox forum)|accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nWhen a Guru Meditation is displayed, the options are to [[booting|reboot]] by pressing the left mouse button, or to invoke ROMWack by pressing the right mouse button. (ROMWack is a minimalist [[debugger]] built into the [[operating system]] which is accessible by connecting a 9600 [[bit]]/s terminal to the [[serial port]].)\n\n[[Image:Guru meditation.gif|frame|center|A simulation of the Guru Meditation error message]]\n[[File:GuruMeditationErrorinDSOrganize 01.jpg|thumb|A Guru Meditation Error in  the Nintendo DS homebrew software DSOrganize]]\n\nThe alert itself appears as a black rectangular box located in the upper portion of the screen. Its border and text are red for a normal Guru Meditation, or green/yellow for a Recoverable Alert, another kind of Guru Meditation. The screen goes black, and the power and disk-activity [[LED]]s may blink immediately before the alert appears. In [[AmigaOS]] 1.x, programmed in [[Read-only memory|ROMs]] known as [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, the errors are always red. In AmigaOS 2.x and 3.x, recoverable alerts are yellow, except for some very early versions of 2.x where they were green.\n\nDead-end alerts are always red and terminal in all OS versions except in a rare series of events, as in when a deprecated Kickstart (example: 1.1) program conditionally boots from disk on a more advanced Kickstart 3.x ROM Amiga running in compatibility mode (therefore eschewing the on-disc OS) and crashes with a red Guru Mediatation but subsequently restores itself by pressing the left mouse button, the newer Kickstart recognizing an inadvised low level chipset call for the older ROM directly poking the hardware, and addressing it.\n\nThe alert occurred when there was a fatal problem with the system. If the system had no means of recovery, it could display the alert, even in systems with numerous critical flaws. In extreme cases, the alert could even be displayed if the system's memory was completely exhausted.\n\nThe error is displayed as two [[field (computer science)|fields]], separated by a period. The format is #0000000x.yyyyyyyy in case of a CPU error, or #aabbcccc.dddddddd in case of a system software error. The first field is either the [[Motorola 68000#Interrupts|Motorola 68000 exception]] number that occurred (if a CPU error occurs) or an internal error identifier (such as an 'Out of Memory' code), in case of a system software error. The second can be the address of a ''Task'' structure, or the address of a memory block whose allocation or deallocation failed. It is never the address of the code that caused the error. If the cause of the crash is uncertain, this number is rendered as 48454C50, which stands for \"HELP\" in hexadecimal [[ASCII]] characters (48=H, 45=E, 4C=L, 50=P).\n\nThe text of the alert messages was completely baffling to most users. Only highly technically adept Amiga users would know, for example, that exception 3 was an address error, and meant the program was accessing a word on an unaligned boundary. Users without this specialized knowledge would have no recourse but to look for a \"Guru\" or to simply reboot the machine and hope for the best.\n\n===Guru Meditation handler===\nThere was a commercially available error handler for AmigaOS, before version 2.04, called GOMF (Get Outta My Face) made by Hypertek/Silicon Springs Development corp. It was able to deal with many kinds of errors and gave the user a choice to either remove the offending process and associated screen, or allow the machine to show the Guru Meditation. In many cases, removal of the offending process gave one the choice to save one's data and exit running programs before rebooting the system. When the damage was not extensive, one was able to continue using the machine. However, it did not save the user from all errors, as one may have still seen this error occasionally.\n\n===Recoverable Alerts===\nRecoverable Alerts are non-critical crashes in the computer system. In most cases, it is possible to resume work and save files after a Recoverable Alert, while a normal, red Guru Meditation always results in an immediate reboot.\n\nIt is, however, still recommended to reboot as soon as possible after encountering a Recoverable Alert, because the system may be in an unpredictable state that can cause data corruption.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==System software error codes==\nThe first byte specifies the area of the system affected.

The company had a product called the ''[[Joyboard]]'', a game controller much like a [[joystick]] but operated by one's feet, similar to the modern-day [[Wii Balance Board]]. Early in the development of the Amiga computer operating system, the company's developers became so frustrated with the system's frequent [[crash (computing)|crashes]] that, as a relaxation technique, a game was developed where a person would sit cross-legged on the Joyboard, resembling an Indian [[guru]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n43/mode/2up|title=How We Created the Amiga Computer by RJ Mical, Info Magazine issue 13}}</ref> The player tried to remain extremely still;  the winner of the game stayed still the longest.

It was modeled after the [[dbx (debugger)|DBX]] debugger, which came with [[BSD|Berkeley Unix]] distributions.<ref name=\"stallman-quote-1986\" />\n\nFrom 1990 to 1993 it was maintained by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Now it is maintained by the GDB Steering Committee which is appointed by the [[Free Software Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=GDB Steering Committee\n|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/committee/\n|accessdate = 2008-05-11}}</ref>\n\n==Technical details==\n===Features===\nGDB offers extensive facilities for tracing and altering the execution of [[computer program]]s. The user can monitor and modify the values of programs' internal [[variable (programming)|variables]], and even call [[subroutine|functions]] independently of the program's normal behavior.\n\nGDB target processors (as of 2003) include: [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[Atmel AVR|AVR]], [[Hitachi H8|H8/300]], [[Altera Nios/Nios II]], [[System/370]], [[System 390]], [[X86]] and its 64-bit extension [[X86-64]], [[Itanium|IA-64]] \"Itanium\", [[Motorola 68000]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PA-RISC]], [[PowerPC]], [[SuperH]], [[SPARC]], and [[VAX]]. Lesser-known target processors supported in the standard release have included [[A29K]], [[ARC (processor)|ARC]], [[ETRAX CRIS]], [[D10V]], [[D30V]], [[FR-30]], [[FR-V]], [[Intel i960]], [[Motorola 68HC11|68HC11]], [[Motorola 88000]], [[MCORE]], [[MN10200]], [[MN10300]], [[320xx microprocessor|NS32K]], [[Stormy16]], and [[Zilog Z8000|Z8000]].  (Newer releases will likely not support some of these.) GDB has compiled-in [[Instruction set simulator|simulators]] for even lesser-known target processors such like [[M32R]] or [[V850]].<ref>{{cite web\n |      title = GDB Documentation - Summary - Contributors\n |        url = http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Contributors.html#Contributors\n | accessdate = 2011-12-01\n}}</ref>\n\nGDB is still actively developed.

Remote operation is when GDB runs on one machine and the program being debugged runs on another. GDB can communicate to the remote \"stub\" that understands GDB protocol through a serial device or TCP/IP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean4/embecosm-howto-rsp-server-ean4-issue-2.pdf|title=Howto: GDB Remote Serial Protocol: Writing a RSP Server}}</ref> A stub program can be created by linking to the appropriate stub files provided with GDB, which implement the target side of the communication protocol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davis.lbl.gov/Manuals/GDB/gdb_17.html#SEC140|title=Implementing a remote stub}}</ref> Alternatively, [[gdbserver]] can be used to remotely debug the program without needing to change it in any way.\n\nThe same mode is also used by [[KGDB]] for debugging a running [[Linux kernel]] on the source level with gdb. With KGDB, kernel developers can debug a kernel in much the same way as they debug application programs. It makes it possible to place breakpoints in kernel code, step through the code and observe variables. On architectures where hardware debugging registers are available, watchpoints can be set which trigger breakpoints when specified memory addresses are executed or accessed. KGDB requires an additional machine which is connected to the machine to be debugged using a [[serial cable]] or [[Ethernet]]. On [[FreeBSD]], it is also possible to debug using [[Firewire]] [[direct memory access]] (DMA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/developers-handbook/kerneldebug-dcons.html|title=Kernel debugging with Dcons}}</ref>\n\n===Graphical user interface===\nThe debugger does not contain its own [[graphical user interface]], and defaults to a [[command-line interface]]. Several front-ends have been built for it, such as [[UltraGDB]], [[Xxgdb]], [[Data Display Debugger]] (DDD), [[Nemiver]], [[KDbg]], [[Xcode]] debugger, GDBtk/Insight and the HP Wildebeest Debugger GUI (WDB GUI). [[Integrated development environment|IDE]]s such as [[Codelite]], [[Code::Blocks]], [[Dev-C++]], [[Geany]], [[GNAT Programming Studio]] (GPS), [[KDevelop]], [[Qt Creator]], [[Lazarus (IDE)|Lazarus]], [[MonoDevelop]], [[List of Eclipse projects#Tools projects|Eclipse]], [[NetBeans]] and [[VisualStudio]] can interface with GDB. [[GNU Emacs]] has a \"GUD mode\" and tools for [[Vim (text editor)|VIM]] exist (e.g. clewn.) These offer facilities similar to debuggers found in IDEs.\n\nSome other debugging tools have been designed to work with GDB, such as [[memory leak]] detectors.\n\n==Examples of commands==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | <tt>gdb program</tt>\n| Debug \"program\" (from the shell)\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | <tt>run -v</tt>\n| Run the loaded program with the parameters\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | <tt>bt </tt>\n| Backtrace (in case the program crashed)\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | <tt>info registers</tt>\n| Dump all registers\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | <tt>disas $pc-32, $pc+32</tt>\n| Disassemble\n|}\n\n==An example session==\nConsider the following source-code written in [[C (programming language)|C]]:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nsize_t foo_len( const char *s )\n{\n  return strlen( s );\n}\n\nint main( int argc, char *argv[] )\n{\n  const char *a = NULL;\n\n  printf( \"size of a = %lu\\n\", foo_len(a) );\n\n  exit( 0 );\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nUsing the [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] compiler on [[Linux]], the code above must be compiled using the <code>-g</code> flag in order to include appropriate debug information on the binary generated, thus making it possible to inspect it using GDB.  Assuming that the file containing the code above is named <code>example.c</code>, the command for the [[Compilation (programming)|compilation]] could be:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"console\">\n$ gcc example.c -Og -g -o example\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAnd the binary can now be run:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"console\">\n$ ./example\nSegmentation fault\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nSince the example code, when executed, generates a [[segmentation fault]], GDB can be used to inspect the problem.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"console\">\n$ gdb ./example\nGNU gdb (GDB) Fedora (7.3.50.20110722-13.fc16)\nCopyright (C) 2011 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

It gained some popularity in the early 2000s due to its speed, flexibility in configuration and features.\n\nThe disagreement over the future of Galeon split the development team in 2002, which resulted in departure of browser's initial author and several other developers. This event marked the beginning of the browser's popularity decline, which led to its discontinuation in September 2008. Some of Galeon's features were subsequently ported to Epiphany (now called [[GNOME Web|Web]]) \u2013 the descendant of Galeon.\n\n== Features ==\nGaleon made use of Gecko's features including configuration options and standards support. Apart from that, Galeon had several features that were uncommon in browsers at that time:<ref name=\"galeon-glance\" /><ref name=\"galeon-history\" /><ref name=\"extraprefs-file\" />\n*mouse [[Gesture recognition|gestures]]\n*configurable [[user agent]] string\n*configurable display of [[favicon]]s\n*customizable [[toolbar]]s\n*configurable position of [[tab (GUI)|tab bar]]\n*[[Smart Bookmarks|smart bookmarks]] with search history\n*ability to specify own fonts and colors for web content\n*configurable [[MIME]] types handler\n*configurable history expiry\n*[[page zooming]]\n\n== Development history ==\nThe project was started by Marco Pesenti Gritti with the goal of creating a web browser that would be fast and consistent with the [[GNOME]] desktop environment. The first public version  (Galeon 0.6) was released in June 2000.<ref name=\"galeon-history\" />\n\n=== On the rise ===\nThe first releases of Galeon were criticised for lack of such basic features as [[HTTP cookie|cookie]] and [[HTTP proxy|proxy]] support,<ref name=\"looking-at-the-galeon\" /> though the browser added some features with every release.{{Fact|date=September 2014}} Version 1.2 of Galeon introduced many new features that drew attention of the general public.<ref name=\"galeon-history\" />{{Failed verification|date=September 2014}}\n\nAt the time of Galeon's creation, the most popular [[Linux]] browsers, including [[Netscape (web browser)|Netscape]] and [[Mozilla Application Suite|Mozilla]], were large multi-functional programs. This made them slow to start and often impractical due to their high memory usage and processor requirements.<ref name=\"lt-valliere-review\" /> [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] was somewhat faster, but it was [[proprietary software]] distributed in [[trialware]] and [[adware]] versions, both of which lacked some of the functionality of the [[Microsoft Windows]] version.<ref name=\"opera-linux-ml\" /><ref name=\"re-opera-linux-ml\" />\n\nGaleon was widely seen as one of the best Linux browsers available.<ref name=\"lt-valliere-review\" /><ref name=\"browser-comparison\" /> The polls revealed the substantial usage share of Galeon,<ref name=\"osnews-gecko-poll\" /> though its popularity was regarded as owing to lack of stability evident in [[Mozilla]]'s browsers.<ref name=\"firefox-won-me\" />{{Failed verification|date=September 2014}}\n\n=== Split of the development team ===\n{{Main|Web (web browser)}}\nWith the release of new version of the [[GTK+]] widget toolkit, which was used to construct the user interface of Galeon, the team decided to write a new version of Galeon from scratch. At the same time the GNOME project has adopted its new [[human interface guidelines]], which promoted simplicity and uniform design.<ref name=\"ghig\" /> The Galeon team had differing opinions on the new guidelines. The author and lead developer, Marco Pesenti Gritti, endorsed them and saw the rewrite as an opportunity to make Galeon simpler. Many other developers believed that reducing the number of preferences and simplifying the user interface would harm the project.<ref name=\"galeon-history\" /><ref name=\"FSM\" />\n\nIn November 2002,<ref name=\"galeon-history\" /> as the result of several discussions on the topic Gritti made the decision to cease his work in Galeon and [[Fork (software development)|fork]] the project and started development of a HIG-compliant web browser he called ''Epiphany'' (now known as [[Web (web browser)|Web]]).<ref name=\"FSM\" /><ref name=\"mozillazine-epiphany-fork\" />\n\n=== After the split ===\nAs Gritti no longer controlled the development of Galeon, the previous functionality was restored in subsequent releases and some new features were added,<ref name=\"interview\" /> though development got slow after the split.<ref name=\"galeon-history\" /> At the same time the rising popularity of Firefox, its status of the default browser in major distribution and the overwhelming number of [[List of Firefox extensions|its extensions]] led to decline of Galeon's user base.<ref name=\"firefox-won-me\" /><ref name=\"FSM\" />\n\nEventually the Galeon developers announced plans to halt development of Galeon, saying \"the current approach is unsustainable\" regarding the resources required to maintain it. Instead, they planned to develop a set of extensions for Epiphany to provide similar functionality.<ref name=\"FSM\" /><ref name=\"future-of-galeon\" />\n\n===Persistence===\nEven after development ceased in September 2008, the browser remained popular and in December 2011 was still available in some [[Linux distribution]]'s repositories, such as [[Debian#Release_timeline|Debian 6 Squeeze]],<ref name=\"Debian6packages\" /> although it was not part of [[Debian#Release_timeline|Debian 7 Wheezy]].<ref name=\"Debian7packages\" />\n\n== Reception ==\nGaleon was praised for its customizability and speed, as compared to [[Netscape Navigator]] and [[Firefox]], though [[Konqueror]] and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] were still faster on older hardware.<ref name=\"galeon-glance\" /><ref name=\"looking-at-the-galeon\" /><ref name=\"lt-valliere-review\" /><ref name=\"geeky-fun\" /> Galeon was noted for its session handling and crash recovery.<ref name=\"lt-valliere-review\" />\n\nIn November 2002, [[OSNews]] conducted a poll to determine the most popular [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]]-based browser, which included several browsers for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]], but didn't include [[Netscape Navigator]] and [[Mozilla Suite]].

Invented by [[Richard Jordan Gatling|Richard Gatling]], it saw occasional use by the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Union Army|forces]] during the [[American Civil War]] in the 1860s, which was the first time it was employed in combat. Later, it was used again in numerous military conflicts, such as the [[Boshin War]], the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], and the assault on [[Battle of San Juan Hill|San Juan Hill]] during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].<ref name=\"enc-sjh\">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-SanJuanHillBattleof.html|title=San Juan Hill, Battle of|first=John W.

Each barrel fired a single shot when it reached a certain point in the cycle, after which it ejected the spent [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], loaded a new round, and, in the process, allowed the barrel to cool somewhat. This configuration allowed higher rates of fire to be achieved without the barrels overheating.\n\nThe Gatling gun was itself an early form of [[rotary cannon]], and today modern rotary cannons are often referred to as ''Gatling guns''.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:GatlingGunDrawing.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Patent drawing]] for R.

The [[Maxim gun]], invented and patented in 1883, was the first true fully automatic weapon, making use of the fired projectile's recoil force to reload the weapon. Nonetheless, the Gatling gun represented a huge leap in [[firearm]] technology.\n\nPrior to the Gatling gun, the only weapons available to military forces capable of firing many projectiles in a short space of time were mass-firing [[volley gun|volley weapons]], like the Belgian and French [[mitrailleuse]] of the 1860s and 1870s, and field [[cannon]]s firing [[canister shot]], much like an upsized [[shotgun]]. The latter were widely used during and after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Although the maximum [[rate of fire]] was increased by firing multiple projectiles simultaneously, these weapons still needed to be reloaded after each discharge, which for multi-barrel systems like the ''mitrailleuse'' was cumbersome and time-consuming. This negated much of the advantage of their high rate of fire per discharge, making them much less powerful on the battlefield. In comparison, the Gatling gun offered a rapid and continuous rate of fire without having to be manually reloaded by opening the breech.\n\nThe original Gatling gun was a field weapon which used multiple rotating barrels turned by a hand [[Crankshaft|crank]], and firing loose (no links or belt) metal cartridge ammunition using a [[gravity feed]] system from a hopper. The Gatling gun's innovation lay in the use of multiple barrels to limit overheating, a rotating mechanism, and a gravity-feed reloading system, which allowed unskilled operators to achieve a relatively high rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute.<ref name=Greeley1872/>\n\nThe US Army adopted Gatling guns in several calibers, including .42 caliber, [[.45-70]], .50 caliber, 1 inch, and (M1893 and later) [[.30 Army]], with conversions of M1900 weapons to [[.30-03]] and [[.30-06]].<ref>Paul Wahl and Don Toppel, ''The Gatling Gun'', Arco Publishing, 1971, p. 155.</ref><ref>Randolph, Captain W.

Gatling guns were used by the Peruvian Navy and Army, especially in the [[Battle of Tacna]] (May 1880) and the [[Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos|Battle of San Juan]] (January 1881) against the invading Chilean Army.\n\nLieutenant A.L. Howard of the [[Connecticut National Guard]] had an interest in the company manufacturing Gatling guns, and took a personally owned Gatling gun to [[Saskatchewan]], Canada, in 1885 for use with the Canadian military against [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] rebels during [[Louis Riel]]'s [[North-West Rebellion]].<ref name=\"proceedings\"/>\n\nEarly multi-barrel guns were approximately the size and weight of [[artillery]] pieces, and were often perceived as a replacement for cannons firing [[grapeshot]] or canister shot.<ref name=\"proceedings\"/> Gatling guns were even mounted aboard ships. Compared with earlier weapons such as the ''mitrailleuse,'' which required manual reloading, the Gatling gun was more reliable and easier to operate, and had a lower, but continuous rate of fire.

John \"Gatling Gun\" Parker]].<ref>Parker, John H. (Lt.), ''History of the Gatling Gun Detachment'', Kansas City, MO: Hudson-Kimberly Publishing Co.

By this time, the [[U.S. Marines]] had been issued the modern tripod-mounted [[M1895 Colt\u2013Browning machine gun]] using the [[6mm Lee Navy]] round, which they employed to defeat the Spanish infantry at the battle of [[1898 invasion of Guant\u00e1namo Bay#Assault on Cuzco Wells|Cuzco Wells]].\n\n==Basic design==\n[[Image:Gatling gun 1865.jpg|thumb|250px|A British 1865 Gatling gun at [[Firepower - The Royal Artillery Museum]]]]\n\nThe Gatling gun operated by a hand-crank mechanism, with six barrels revolving around a central shaft (although some models had as many as ten). Each barrel fires once per revolution at about the same position. The barrels, a carrier, and a lock cylinder were separate and all mounted on a solid plate revolving around a central shaft, mounted on an oblong fixed frame. Turning the crank rotated the shaft. The carrier was grooved and the lock cylinder was drilled with holes corresponding to the barrels.\n\nThe casing was partitioned, and through this opening the barrel shaft was journaled. In front of the casing was a cam with spiral surfaces. The cam imparted a reciprocating motion to the locks when the gun rotated. Also in the casing was a cocking ring with projections to cock and fire the gun. Each barrel had a single lock, working in the lock cylinder on a line with the barrel. The lock cylinder was encased and joined to the frame. Early models had a fibrous matting stuffed in among the barrels, which could be soaked with water to cool the barrels down. Later models eliminated the matting-filled barrels as being unnecessary.\n\nCartridges, held in a hopper, dropped individually into the grooves of the carrier. The lock was simultaneously forced by the cam to move forward and load the cartridge, and when the cam was at its highest point, the cocking ring freed the lock and fired the cartridge. After the cartridge was fired the continuing action of the cam drew back the lock bringing with it the spent cartridge which then dropped to the ground.\n\nThe grouped barrel concept had been explored by inventors since the 18th century, but poor engineering and the lack of a [[Cartridge (weaponry)|unitary cartridge]] made previous designs unsuccessful. The initial Gatling gun design used self-contained, reloadable steel cylinders with a chamber holding a ball and black-powder charge, and a percussion cap on one end. As the barrels rotated, these steel cylinders dropped into place, were fired, and were then ejected from the gun. The innovative features of the Gatling gun were its independent firing mechanism for each barrel and the simultaneous action of the locks, barrels, carrier and [[breech-loading weapon|breech]].\n\nThe ammunition that Gatling eventually implemented was a [[paper cartridge]] style round charged with black powder and primed with a percussion cap. because self-contained brass cartridges were not yet fully developed and available. The shells were gravity-fed into the breech through a hopper or simple box \"magazine\" with an unsprung gravity follower on top of the gun. Each barrel had its own firing mechanism.\n\nDespite self-contained brass cartridges replacing the paper cartridge in the 1860s, it wasn't until the Model 1881 that Gatling switched to the 'Bruce'-style feed system (U.S. Patents 247,158 and 343,532) that accepted two rows of [[.45-70]] cartridges. While one row was being fed into the gun, the other could be reloaded, thus allowing sustained fire. The final gun required four operators. By 1886, the gun was capable of firing more than 400 rounds per minute.\n\nThe smallest-caliber gun also had a Broadwell drum feed in place of the curved box of the other guns. The drum, named after L. W. Broadwell, an agent for Gatling's company, comprised twenty stacks of rounds arranged around a central axis, like the spokes of a wheel, each holding twenty cartridges with the bullet noses oriented toward the central axis. This invention was patented in U. S. 110,338. As each stack emptied, the drum was manually rotated to bring a new stack into use until all 400 rounds had been fired. A more common variant had 240 rounds in twenty stands of fifteen.\n\nBy 1893, the Gatling was adapted to take the new [[.30-40 Krag|.30 Army]] smokeless cartridge. The new M1893 guns featured six barrels, later increased to ten barrels, and were capable of a maximum (initial) rate of fire of 800\u2013900 rounds per minute, though 600 rpm was recommended for continuous fire.<ref name=\"Parker, John H. 2006\"/><ref>U.S. Ordnance Dept., ''Handbook of the Gatling Gun, Caliber .30 Models of 1895, 1900, and 1903'', Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, (1905) p. 21</ref> Dr. Gatling later used examples of the M1893 powered by electric motor and belt to drive the crank.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/2433/eleckeygatling.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725152641/http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/2433/eleckeygatling.jpg |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}</ref>  Tests demonstrated the electric Gatling could fire bursts of up to 1,500&nbsp;rpm.\n\nThe M1893, with minor revisions, became the M1895, and 94 guns were produced for the U.S. Army by Colt. Four M1895 Gatlings under Lt. [[John Henry Parker (general)|John H. Parker]] saw considerable combat during the Santiago campaign in Cuba in 1898. The M1895 was designed to accept only the Bruce feeder. All previous models were unpainted, but the M1895 was painted olive drab (O.D.) green, with some parts left [[Bluing (steel)|blued]].\n\nThe Model 1900 was very similar to the model 1895, but with only a few components finished in O.D. green. The U.S. Army purchased a quantity of M1900s. All Gatling Models 1895\u20131903 could be mounted on an armored field carriage. In 1903, the Army converted its M1900 guns in .30 Army to fit the new [[.30-03]] cartridge (standardized for the M1903 Springfield rifle) as the M1903. The later M1903-'06 was an M1903 converted to [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-06]]. This conversion was principally carried out at the Army's Springfield Armory arsenal repair shops. All models of Gatling guns were declared obsolete by the U.S. military in 1911, after 45 years of service.<ref>Wahl and Toppel, 1971, p. 155</ref>\n\n==Development of modern Gatling-type guns==\n{{main article|Minigun|Rotary cannon}}\n\nAfter the Gatling gun was replaced in service by newer recoil or gas-operated weapons, the approach of using multiple externally powered rotating barrels fell into disuse for many decades. However, some examples were developed during the interwar years, but only existed as prototypes or were rarely used. The concept resurfaced after World War II with the development of the [[Minigun]] and the [[M61 Vulcan]]. Many other versions of the Gatling gun were built from the late 20th century to the present, the largest of these being the 30mm [[GAU-8 Avenger]] autocannon.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Agar gun]]\n* [[Centrifugal gun]]\n* [[Gorgas machine gun]]\n* [[List of multiple barrel firearms]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Ordnance Department | first=United States |authorlink= United States Army Ordnance Corps |title=Handbook of the Gatling Gun, Caliber .30 | pages = |publisher= Government Printing Office | year=1917 | location = Washington, D.C. | url= https://archive.org/details/handbookgatling00statgoog | doi= | isbn=}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Gatling guns|Gatling gun}}\n* Randolph, Captain W.

The GDR dissolved itself, and Germany was [[German reunification|reunified]] on 3 October 1990, becoming a fully sovereign state again. Several of the GDR's leaders, notably its last communist leader [[Egon Krenz]], were prosecuted in reunified Germany for crimes committed during the Cold War.\n\nGeographically, the German Democratic Republic bordered the [[Baltic Sea]] to the north; [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] to the east; [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] to the southeast and [[West Germany]] to the southwest and west. Internally, the GDR also bordered the Soviet sector of [[History of Berlin#West and East Germany|Allied-occupied Berlin]], known as [[East Berlin]], which was also administered as the state's ''de facto'' capital. It also bordered the three sectors occupied by the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] known collectively as West Berlin. The three sectors occupied by the Western nations were sealed off from the rest of the GDR by the Berlin Wall from its construction in 1961 until it was brought down in 1989.\n\n==Naming conventions==\nThe official name was ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' (German Democratic Republic), usually abbreviated to ''DDR''. Both terms were used in East Germany, with increasing usage of the abbreviated form, especially since East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners to be foreigners following the promulgation of its [[Constitution of East Germany (1968)|second constitution]] in 1968.

Ritter (2002) has argued that the East German state was defined by two dominant forces&nbsp;\u2013 Soviet Communism on the one hand, and German traditions filtered through the interwar experiences of German Communists on the other. It always was constrained by the powerful example of the increasingly prosperous West, to which East Germans compared their nation. The changes wrought by the Communists were most apparent in ending capitalism and transforming industry and agriculture, in the militarization of society, and in the political thrust of the educational system and the media. On the other hand, there was relatively little change made in the historically independent domains of the sciences, the engineering professions, the Protestant churches, and in many bourgeois lifestyles. Social policy, says Ritter, became a critical legitimization tool in the last decades and mixed socialist and traditional elements about equally.<ref>Gerhard A.

Initially this meant the construction of three zones of occupation, i.e., American, British, and Soviet. Later, a French zone was carved out of the American and British zones.\n\n===1949 establishment===\n{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}\nThe ruling communist party, known as the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED), was formed in April 1946 from the merger between the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) by mandate of [[Joseph Stalin]]. The two former parties were notorious rivals when they were active before the Nazis consolidated all power and criminalised their agitation. The unification of the two parties was symbolic {{citation needed|date=April 2017}} of the new friendship of German socialists in defeating their common enemy; however, the communists, who held a majority, had virtually total control over policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hdg.de/lemo/html/Nachkriegsjahre/PolitischerNeubeginn/sed.html|title=LeMO Kapitel: Zwangsvereinigung zur SED|author=Stiftung Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland|website=hdg.de}}</ref> The SED was the ruling party for the entire duration of the East German state. It had close ties with the USSR, which maintained [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|military forces in East Germany]] until its dissolution in 1991 (the Russian Federation continued to maintain forces in what had been East Germany until 1994), with the stated purpose of countering [[NATO]] bases in West Germany. Historians debate whether the decision to form a separate country was initiated by the USSR or by the SED.<ref>See Spilker (2006)</ref>\n\nAs West Germany was reorganised and gained independence from its occupiers, the German Democratic Republic was established in East Germany in 1949.

Cienciala \"History 557 Lecture Notes]</ref> On 10 March 1952, (in what would become known as the \"[[Stalin Note]]\") Stalin put forth a proposal to reunify Germany with a policy of neutrality, with no conditions on economic policies and with guarantees for \"the rights of man and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political conviction, and assembly\" and free activity of democratic parties and organizations.<ref>Steininger, Rolf (1990). The German Question: The Stalin Note of 1952 and the Problem of Reunification. New York: Columbia University</ref> This was turned down; reunification was not a priority for the leadership of West Germany, and the NATO powers declined the proposal, asserting that Germany should be able to join [[NATO]] and that such a negotiation with the Soviet Union would be seen as a capitulation. There have been several debates about whether a real chance for reunification had been missed in 1952.\n\nIn 1949 the Soviets turned control of East Germany over to the Socialist Unity Party, headed by [[Wilhelm Pieck]] (1876\u20131960), who became president of the GDR and held the office until his death, while most executive authority was assumed by SED General Secretary [[Walter Ulbricht]].

The SED set a primary goal of ridding East Germany of all traces of the fascist regime.

In eastern Germany, the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ&nbsp;\u2013 ''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'') comprised the five states (''L\u00e4nder'') of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], and [[Thuringia]]. Disagreements over the policies to be followed in the occupied zones quickly led to a breakdown in cooperation between the four powers, and the Soviets administered their zone without regard to the policies implemented in the other zones. The Soviets withdrew from the ACC in 1948; subsequently as the other three zones were increasingly unified and granted self-government, the Soviet administration instituted a separate socialist government in its zone.\n\n[[File:Deutschland Bundeslaender 1949.png|thumb|left|upright|Germany 1949: West Germany (blue) comprised the Western Allies' zones, excluding the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]] (purple); the Soviet zone, East Germany (red) surrounded West Berlin (yellow)]]\n\nYet, seven years after the Allies' [[Potsdam Agreement]] to a unified Germany, the USSR via the [[Stalin Note]] (10 March 1952) proposed [[German reunification]] and [[superpower disengagement]] from Central Europe, which the three Western Allies (the [[United States]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]]) rejected. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], a Communist proponent of reunification, died in early March 1953. Similarly, [[Lavrenty Beria]], the First Deputy Prime Minister of the USSR, pursued German reunification, but he was removed from power that same year before he could act on the matter. His successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], rejected reunification as equivalent to returning East Germany for annexation to the West; hence reunification went unconsidered until 1989.\n\n[[File:Deutschland Besatzungszonen 1945.svg|thumb|upright|Post-war occupied Germany: British (green), Soviet (red), American (orange), and French (blue) occupation zones]]\n\n[[File:West and East Berlin.svg|thumb|<center>West and East Berlin with Berlin wall {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/West and East Berlin|interactive map]])}}</center>]]\nEast Germany considered East Berlin to be its capital, and the Soviet Union and the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]] diplomatically recognized East Berlin as the capital. However, the Western Allies disputed this recognition, considering the entire city of Berlin to be [[military occupation|occupied territory]] governed by the [[Allied Control Council]]. According to Margarete Feinstein, East Berlin's status as the capital was largely unrecognized by the West and most Third World countries.<ref name=\"German Democratic Republic page 78\">\"State symbols: the quest for legitimacy in the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, 1949\u20131959\", by Margarete Myers Feinstein, page 78: \" ... claims of East Berlin as the capital of the GDR, ... East Berlin was not recognized by the West and most Third World countries\"</ref> In practice, the ACC's authority was rendered moot by the [[Cold War]], and East Berlin's status as occupied territory largely became a [[legal fiction]], and the former Soviet sector became fully integrated into the GDR.\n\nThe deepening Cold War conflict between the Western Powers and the Soviet Union over the unresolved status of West Berlin led to the [[Berlin Blockade]] (24 June 1948&nbsp;\u2013 12 May 1949). The Soviet army initiated the blockade by halting all Allied rail, road, and water traffic to and from West Berlin. The Allies countered the Soviets with the [[Berlin Airlift]] (1948\u201349) of food, fuel, and supplies to West Berlin.<ref>Michael D.

The NF was established to stand for election to the ''Volkskammer'' ([[People's Chamber]]), the East German parliament. The first and only President of the German Democratic Republic was [[Wilhelm Pieck]]. However, after 1950, political power in East Germany was held by the First Secretary of the SED, [[Walter Ulbricht]].<ref>[[Patrick Major]] and Jonathan Osmund, ''Workers' and Peasants' State: Communism and Society in East Germany under Ulbricht, 1945\u201371'' (2002)</ref>\n\n[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0002794 002 Portrait Walter Ulbrichts im Publikum der Bachfeier.jpg|thumb|left|upright|SED First Secretary, [[Walter Ulbricht]], 1950]]\n\nOn 16 June 1953, workers constructing the new ''[[Stalinallee]]'' boulevard in [[East Berlin]], according to [[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design]], rioted against a 10% production quota increase.

Fearing anti-communist [[counter-revolution]] on 18 June 1953, the government of the GDR enlisted the [[Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany|Soviet Occupation Forces]] to aid the police in ending the riot; some fifty people were killed and 10,000 were jailed.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,894998,00.html East Berlin 17 June 1953: Stones Against Tanks], ''Deutsche Welle''.

While the Ulbricht government had experimented with liberal reforms, the Honecker government reversed them. The new government introduced a new [[East German Constitution]] which defined the German Democratic Republic as a \"republic of workers and peasants\".<ref>Henry Krisch, \"Soviet-GDR Relations in the Honecker Era\", ''East Central Europe,'' December 1979, Vol. 6 Issue 2, pp. 152\u2013172</ref>\n\nInitially, East Germany claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for all of Germany, a claim supported by most of the Communist bloc. It claimed that West Germany was an illegally constituted NATO puppet state. However, from the 1960s onward, East Germany began recognizing itself as a separate country from West Germany, and shared the legacy of the [[German Reich|united German state of 1871\u20131945]]. This was formalized in 1974, when the reunification clause was removed from the revised East German constitution. West Germany, in contrast, maintained that it was the only legitimate government of Germany. From 1949 to the early 1970s, West Germany maintained that East Germany was an illegally constituted state. It argued that the GDR was a Soviet puppet state, and frequently referred to it as the \"Soviet occupation zone\". This position was shared by West Germany's allies as well until 1973. East Germany was recognized primarily by Communist countries and the Arab bloc, along with some \"scattered sympathizers\".<ref name=time>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903634,00.html|title=EAST GERMANY: The Price of Recognition|date=1 January 1973|work=TIME.com}}</ref> According to the [[Hallstein Doctrine]] (1955), West Germany also did not establish (formal) diplomatic ties with any country&nbsp;\u2013 except the USSR&nbsp;\u2013 that recognized East German sovereignty.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P0801-026, Helsinki, KSZE-Konferenz, Schlussakte.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Helsinki Final Act: Chancellor of Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) [[Helmut Schmidt]],\nChairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) [[Erich Honecker]], U.S. president [[Gerald Ford]] and Austrian chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]]]]\n\nBut in the early 1970s, the ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' (\"Eastern Policy\") of \"Change Through Rapprochement\" of the pragmatic government of FRG Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], established normal diplomatic relations with the [[East Bloc]] states.

Both countries were admitted into the United Nations on 18 September 1973. This also increased the number of countries recognizing East Germany to 55, including the US, UK and France, though these three still refused to recognize East Berlin as the capital, and insisted on a specific provision in the UN resolution accepting the two Germanys into the UN to that effect.<ref name=\"time\"/>  Following the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a ''de facto'' government within a single German nation and a ''de jure'' state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognise the GDR ''de jure'' as a sovereign state under international law; but it fully acknowledged that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state. By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' government, but also the sole ''de jure'' legitimate representative of a dormant \"Germany as whole\".<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Presss|pages= 14]}}</ref>  The two Germanys relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations ''de jure'' in participating in international bodies and agreements, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]].\n\nThis assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1973;<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Presss|pages= 308}}</ref>\n{{quote|... the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law.

[[Kurt Masur]], the conductor of the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]], led local negotiations with the government and held town meetings in the concert hall.<ref>Darnton, Robert, ''Berlin Journal'' (New York, 1992, W.W. Norton) pp.98\u201399</ref> The demonstrations eventually led Erich Honecker to resign in October, and he was replaced by a slightly more moderate communist, [[Egon Krenz]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Mary Elise Sarotte, ''Collapse: The Accidental Opening of the Berlin Wall'', New York: Basic Books, 2014</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1989, a few sections of the Berlin Wall were opened, resulting in thousands of East Germans crossing freely into West Berlin and West Germany for the first time in nearly 30 years. Krenz resigned a few days later, and the SED abandoned power shortly afterward. Although there were some limited attempts to create a permanent democracy in East Germany, this did not come to pass.\n\nEast Germany held [[East German general election, 1990|its last elections in March 1990]]. The winner was a coalition headed by the East German branch of West Germany's [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], which advocated speedy reunification. Negotiations ([[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany|2+4]] Talks) were held involving the two German states and the former [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] which led to agreement on the conditions for German unification. By a two-thirds vote in the ''[[Volkskammer]]'' on 23 August 1990, the German Democratic Republic declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany. The five original [[New states of Germany|East German states]] that had been abolished in the 1952 redistricting were restored.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On 3 October 1990, the five states officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany, while East and West Berlin united as a third city-state (in the same manner as [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]]). On 1 July a currency union preceded the political union: the \"Ostmark\" was abolished, and the Western German \"Deutsche Mark\" became common currency.\n\nAlthough the Volkskammer's declaration of accession to the Federal Republic had initiated the process of reunification; the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms, conditions and qualifications; some of which involved amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Presss|pages= 309}}</ref> This treaty was then voted into effect prior to the agreed date for Unification by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic.\n\nThe great economic and socio-political inequalities between the former Germanies required government subsidy for the full integration of the Democratic Republic of Germany into the German Federal Republic. Because of the resulting [[deindustrialization]] in the former East Germany, the causes of the failure of this integration continue to be debated. Some western commentators claim that the depressed eastern economy is a natural aftereffect of a demonstrably inefficient [[command economy]]. But many East German critics contend that the [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock-therapy]] style of [[privatization]], the artificially high [[rate of exchange]] offered for the [[East German mark|Ostmark]], and the speed with which the entire process was implemented did not leave room for East German enterprises to adapt.<ref>For example the economist J\u00f6rg Roesler&nbsp;\u2013 see: J\u00f6rg Roesler: Ein Anderes Deutschland war m\u00f6glich. Alternative Programme f\u00fcr das wirtschaftliche Zusammengehen beider deutscher Staaten, in: [[Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. II/2010, pp.34-46. The historian Ulrich Busch argued that the currency union came too early; see Ulrich Busch: Die W\u00e4hrungsunion am 1.

Conradt, ''The German Polity'' (2008) p. 20</ref> These included: 1949\u201361, which saw the building of socialism; 1961\u20131970 after the Berlin Wall closed off escape was a period of stability and consolidation; 1971\u201385 was termed the [[Honecker]] Era, and saw closer ties with West Germany; and 1985\u201389 saw the decline and extinction of East Germany.\n\n===Organization===\n{{Further|Constitution of East Germany}}\nThe ruling political party in East Germany was the ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' ([[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], SED). It was created in 1946 through the Soviet-directed merger of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in the Soviet controlled zone. However, the SED quickly transformed into a full-fledged Communist party as the more independent-minded Social Democrats were pushed out.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Eric D. Weitz, ''Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997</ref>\n\nThe Potsdam Agreement committed the Soviets to supporting a democratic form of government in Germany, though the Soviets' understanding of \"democracy\" was radically different from that of the West. As in other Soviet-bloc countries, [[Bloc party (politics)|non-communist political parties]] were allowed. Nevertheless, every political party in the GDR was forced to join the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of Democratic Germany]], a broad coalition of parties and mass political organisations, including:\n* ''Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands'' ([[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union of Germany]], CDU), which merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.\n* ''Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands'' ([[Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany]], DBD). The party merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.\n* ''Liberal-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]], LDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.\n* ''Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[National Democratic Party of Germany (East Germany)|National Democratic Party of Germany]], NDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Palast der Republik DDR 1977.jpg|thumb|[[Palace of the Republic (Berlin)|Palast der Republik]], the seat of the [[Volkskammer]]]]\n[[File:Berlin DDR.jpg|thumb|Poster with inscription \"Berlin - Hauptstadt der DDR\", 1967]]\n{{OSM Location map\n| coord = {{coord|22|02|00|N|81|24|00|W|}}\n|  zoom =   10\n| width =  217\n| height = 250\n| caption = [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Island]] was gifted to East Germany in 1972 by Cuba as an act of fraternity, although the resulting status of the island is now unclear.<ref>{{cite web|website=Deutsche Welle (DW)|url=http://www.dw.com/en/castros-caribbean-island-gift-to-east-germany/a-36539460| title=Castro's Caribbean island gift to East Germany| date= 27 November 2016| author= Nik Martin}}</ref>\n\n| minimap = file\n| mini-file = LocationCuba.svg\n| mini-width = 100\n| mini-height = 50\n| minipog-x = 56\n| minipog-y = 17\n| scalemark = 105\n| mark-coord =       {{coord|22.033333|-81.4}}\n|      label =       Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Island\n| label-color=       black\n|  label-pos =       top\n| mark-title =       Ernst Th\u00e4llman Island\n}}\nThe member parties were almost completely subservient to the SED, and had to accept its \"[[vanguard party|leading role]]\" as a condition of their existence. However, the parties did have representation in the Volkskammer and received some posts in the government.\n\nThe Volkskammer also included representatives from the ''[[mass movement|mass organisations]]'' like the [[Free German Youth]] (''Freie Deutsche Jugend'' or ''FDJ''), or the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]]. There was also a [[Democratic Women's Federation of Germany]], with seats in the Volkskammer.\n\nImportant non-parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the German Gymnastics and Sports Association (''Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund'' or ''[[DTSB]]''), and [[People's Solidarity]] (''Volkssolidarit\u00e4t''), an organisation for the elderly. Another society of note was the [[Society for German-Soviet Friendship]].\n\nAfter the fall of Communism, the SED was renamed the \"[[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]]\" (PDS) which continued for a decade after reunification before merging with the West German [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative|WASG]] to form the [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] (''Die Linke'').

The new ''Bezirke'', named after their district centres, were as follows: (i) [[Rostock]], (ii) [[Neubrandenburg]], and (iii) [[Schwerin]] created from the ''Land'' (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) [[Potsdam]], (v) [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], and (vii) [[Cottbus]] from Brandenburg; (vi) [[Magdeburg]] and (viii) [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix) [[Leipzig]], (xi) [[Dresden]], and (xii) [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]] (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from 1990) from Saxony; and (x) [[Erfurt]], (xiii) [[Gera]], and (xiv) [[Suhl]] from Thuringia.\n\nEast Berlin was made the country's 15th ''Bezirk'' in 1961 but retained special legal status until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city as a whole being legally under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the ''Bezirk'' of Berlin as part of its territory.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0816-002, Leipzig, Karl-Marx-Platz, Brunnen.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[City-Hochhaus Leipzig|Uni-Riese]] (''University Giant'') in 1982.

Chief among these was the Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the [[Cold War]] (1945\u201392), its military forces were among the most advanced of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute.\n\n=== National People's Army ===\n{{Main|National People's Army}}\nThe Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It was formed in 1956 from the [[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]] (Barracked People's Police), the military units of the regular police ([[Volkspolizei]]), when East Germany joined the Warsaw Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)]]. It was an all volunteer force until an eighteen-month [[conscription]] period was introduced in 1962. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\nIt was regarded by NATO officers as the best military in the Warsaw Pact.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|title=East German Military: Warsaw Pact's Finest|first1=Bernard E.|last1=Trainor|first2=Special to the New York|last2=Times|date=8 November 1988|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\nThe NVA consisted of the following branches:\n* Army ''([[Landstreitkr\u00e4fte]])''\n* Navy ''([[Volksmarine]]''&nbsp;\u2013  People's Navy)\n* Air Force ''([[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte/Luftverteidigung]])''\n\n=== Border troops ===\n{{Main|Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic}}\nThe border troops of the Eastern sector were originally organised as a police force, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei, similar to the [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] in West Germany. It was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East Germany in 1956, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei was transformed into a military force in 1961, modeled after the [[Soviet Border Troops]], and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense, as part of the National People's Army. In 1973, it was separated from the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately 47,000 men.\n\n=== Volkspolizei ===\n{{Main|Bereitschaftspolizei#In the former German Democratic Republic}}\nAfter the NVA was separated from the Volkspolizei in 1956, the Ministry of the Interior maintained its own public order barracked reserve, known as the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (VPB). These units were, like the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, equipped as motorised infantry, and they numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 men.\n\n=== Stasi ===\n{{main|Stasi}}\nThe Ministry of State Security (Stasi) included the [[Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment]], which was mainly involved with facilities security and plain clothes events security. They were the only part of the feared Stasi that was visible to the public, and so were very unpopular within the population. The Stasi numbered around 90,000 men, the Guards Regiment around 11,000-12,000 men.\n\n=== Combat groups of the working class ===\nThe ''[[Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse]]'' (combat groups of the working class) numbered around 400,000 for much of their existence, and were organised around factories. The KdA was the political-military instrument of the SED; it was essentially a \"party Army\". All KdA directives and decisions were made by the ZK's ''[[Politburo|Politb\u00fcro]]''. They received their training from the Volkspolizei and the Ministry of the Interior. Membership was voluntary, but SED members were required to join as part of their membership obligation.\n\n=== Conscientious objection ===\n{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany}}\nEvery man was required to serve eighteen months of [[conscription|compulsory military service]]; for the medically unqualified and [[conscientious objector]], there were the ''[[Baueinheiten]]'' (construction units), established in 1964, two years after the introduction of conscription, in response to political pressure by the national [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant Church upon the GDR's government. In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former [[w:de:Bausoldat|construction soldiers]] were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere.\n\n=== United States as primary threat ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-48550-0036, Besuch Ho Chi Minhs bei Pionieren, bei Berlin.jpg|thumb|North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] with East German [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]], 1957]]\nThe East German state promoted an anti-imperialist line that was reflected in all its media and all the schools.<ref>[[Mark Allinson]], ''Politics and Popular Opinion in East Germany 1945\u20131968'' (2000) ch 1</ref>  This line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and [[Georgi Dimitrov|Dimitrov's]] theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of [[finance capitalism|financial capitalism]]. Popular reaction to these measures was mixed, and Western media penetrated the country both through cross-border television and radio broadcasts from West Germany and from the American propaganda network [[Radio Free Europe]]. Dissidents, particularly professionals, sometimes fled to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.<ref>Schnoor, \"The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR,\" 2:618-26</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam|title=Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History ; a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1067|isbn=9781851096282}}</ref>\n\n=== Support of Third World socialist countries ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z1014-018, Berlin, Staatsoberhaupt Angolas an der Grenze.jpg|thumb|right|Angola's [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] during his visit in East Berlin.]]\nAfter receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972\u201373, the DDR began active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation movements]]. While the USSR was in control of the overall strategy and Cuban armed forces were involved in the actual combat (mostly in the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and socialist [[Derg|Ethiopia]]), the DDR provided experts for military hardware maintenance and personnel training, and oversaw creation of secret security agencies based on its own Stasi model.\n\nAlready in the 1960s contacts were established with Angola's [[MPLA]], Mozambique's [[FRELIMO]] and the [[PAIGC]] in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. In the 1970s official cooperation was established with other self-proclaimed socialist governments and people's republics: [[People's Republic of the Congo]], [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], [[Somali Democratic Republic]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], and the [[People's Republic of Benin]].\n\nThe first military agreement was signed in 1973 with the People's Republic of the Congo. In 1979 friendship treaties were signed with Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia.\n\nIt was estimated that altogether, 2000\u20134000 DDR military and security experts were dispatched to Africa. In addition, representatives from African and Arab countries and liberation movements underwent military training in the DDR.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rOoyp-1UOH4C&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=east+germany+and+third+world&source=bl&ots=GSaudjtQjD&sig=AwrJR5lSuvfrQ6PnMABzOs_gIls&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nK5QVfTlO8a3sQHD0YGQAQ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=east%20germany%20and%20third%20world&f=false ''Moscow's Third World Strategy''], Alvin Z.

The [[Red Army]] dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and [[Lower Silesia]], with its coal mines and [[Szczecin]], an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin.<ref name=\"Norman M.

In 1950, the GDR joined the [[COMECON]] trade bloc. In 1985, [[collective]] (state) enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent.

East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a [[hard currency]]) and the necessary [[Staatsbank]] [[foreign currency account]] could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via [[Intershop]]. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish [[Jauerfood]], and Genex companies.\n\nThe government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as \"the second pay packet\".<ref>Boroch, Wilfried (1996), \"Social policy as an institutional transformation problem\", ''Transition Economies'', Volume 31, Number 3, pp. 139-146.</ref>  At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft currency as worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark (DM).<ref>Jonathan R.

Christianity and the Encounter of the World Religions (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963), p. 20.</ref> By 1989, membership in the Christian churches dropped significantly.

The share of people who considered themselves non-religious rose from 5% in 1950 to 70% in 1989.\n\n===State atheism===\n{{Further|State atheism|Irreligion in Germany}}\nWhen it first came to power, the Communist party asserted the compatibility of Christianity and Marxism and sought Christian participation in the building of socialism. At first the promotion of [[Marxist-Leninist atheism]] received little official attention. In the mid-1950s, as the Cold War heated up, atheism became a topic of major interest for the state, in both domestic and foreign contexts. University chairs and departments devoted to the study of scientific atheism were founded and much literature (scholarly and popular) on the subject was produced.{{by whom|date=September 2015}} This activity subsided in the late 1960s amid perceptions that it had started to become counterproductive. Official and scholarly attention to atheism renewed beginning in 1973, though this time with more emphasis on scholarship and on the training of cadres than on propaganda. Throughout, the attention paid to atheism in East Germany was never intended to jeopardise the cooperation that was desired from those East Germans who were religious.<ref>Fulbrook, \"The Limits Of Totalitarianism: God, State and Society in the GDR\"</ref>\n\n===Protestantism===\n{{Main|de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|l1=Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0613-039, Sitzung des Martin-Luther-Komitees.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|A 1980 meeting between representatives of the BEK and Erich Honecker]]\nEast Germany, historically, was majority [[Protestant]] (primarily [[Lutheran]]) from the early stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]] onwards. In 1948, freed from the influence of the [[Nazism|Nazi-oriented]] [[German Christians]], [[Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]] and [[united and uniting churches|United churches]] from most parts of Germany came together as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD) at the Conference of Eisenach (''Kirchenversammlung von Eisenach'').\n\nIn 1969 the regional Protestant churches in East Germany and [[East Berlin]]<ref>The Eastern churches were the [[Evangelical Church of Anhalt]], [[Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia#Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg]] (EKiBB, East Ambit, for East Berlin and Brandenburg), [[Evangelical Church of Silesia|Evangelical Church of the G\u00f6rlitz Ecclesiastical Region]], [[Pomeranian Evangelical Church#Evangelical Church in Greifswald|Evangelical Church in Greifswald]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg]], [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony]], [[Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony]] (KPS), [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia]] and [[Evangelical Church of the Union]] (East Region, for EKiBB-East Ambit, G\u00f6rlitz, Greifswald and KPS, and since 1970 for Anhalt too).</ref> broke away from the EKD and formed the ''Federation of Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic'' ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR]]}}, BEK), in 1970 also joined by the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] ''Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine''. In June 1991, following the [[German reunification]], the BEK churches again merged with the EKD ones.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1971 the [[leadership]] of the East German Lutheran churches gradually changed its relations with the state from hostility to cooperation.<ref>Martin Onnasch, \"Konflikt und Kompromiss: Die Haltung der evangelischen Kirchen zu den gesellschaftlichen Ver\u00e4nderungen in der DDR am Anfang der f\u00fcnfziger Jahre,\" [\"Conflict and compromise: the position of the Protestant churches with regard to social changes in the GDR at the beginning of the 1950s\"], ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte / Halbjahresschrift f\u00fcr Theologie und Geschichtswisseschaft,'' 1990, Vol. 3 Issue 1, page 152\u2013165</ref> From the founding of the GDR in 1949, the Socialist Unity Party sought to weaken the influence of the church on the rising generation. The church adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance toward the state. Around 1956 this began to develop into a more neutral stance accommodating conditional loyalty. The government was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, the church leaders started viewing the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. But on matters where the state demanded something which the churches felt was not in accordance with the will of God, the churches reserved their right to say no. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which made it clear that the East German state was not temporary. The loss of church members also made it clear to the leaders of the church that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the state. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional liberal Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas.<ref name=\"Stephen R.

In 1969 he helped found the ''Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR'' (BEK), where he negotiated with the government while at the same time working within the institutions of this Protestant body. He won the regional elections for the Brandenburg state assembly at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Stolpe remained in the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.\n\nApart from the Protestant state churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Landeskirche]]n}}) united in the EKD/BEK and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] there was a number of smaller Protestant bodies, including Protestant Free Churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Freikirche|Evangelische Freikirchen]]}}) united in the [[:de:Bund Evangelisch-Freikirchlicher Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic]] and the [[:de:Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in Germany]], as well as [[:de:Evangelisch-Lutherische Freikirche|the Free Lutheran Church]], [[:de:Evangelisch-lutherische (altlutherische) Kirche|the Old Lutheran Church]] and [[:de:Kirchenbund Evangelisch-Reformierter Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Reformed Churches in the German Democratic Republic]].

During the early postwar years, tensions were high. The Catholic Church as a whole (and particularly the bishops) resisted both the East German state and Marxist ideology. The state allowed the bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion.<ref name=\"Stephen R. Bowers 1982, pp 73-86\"/>\n\nAfter 1945 the Church did fairly well in integrating Catholic exiles from lands to the east (which mostly became part of Poland) and in adjusting its institutional structures to meet the needs of a church within an officially atheist society. This meant an increasingly hierarchical church structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of [[Caritas International|Caritas]], a Catholic charity organisation.

Both of these networks were run by the [[Deutsche Post der DDR]] (East German Post Office). East Germany was assigned telephone country code [[+37]]; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code +49.\n\nAn unusual feature of the telephone network was that, in most cases, [[direct distance dialing]] for [[long distance call|long-distance calls]] was not possible. Although [[area codes]] were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for [[local call]]s and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.\n\nIn 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at [[F\u00fcrstenwalde]] for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, [[Intersputnik]].\n\n== Official and public holidays ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

All children could attend school free of charge, they received vocational training or studied, and were guaranteed a job after training. Work was more than just a means to earn money. Men and women received equal pay for equal work and performance. Equality for women was not just on paper. Care for children and the elderly was the law. Medical care was free, cultural and leisure activities affordable. Social security was a matter of course. We knew no beggars or homelessness. There was a sense of solidarity. People felt responsible not only for themselves, but worked in various democratic bodies on the basis of common interests.<ref>[http://www.workers.org/articles/2015/11/16/interview-with-the-gdrs-margot-honecker-the-past-was-brought-back/ Interview with the GDR\u2019s Margot Honecker \u2014 'The past was brought back'], ''[[Workers World]]'', 16 November 2015</ref></blockquote>\n\nGerman historian [[J\u00fcrgen Kocka]] in 2010 summarized the consensus of most recent scholarship:\n\n<blockquote>Conceptualizing the GDR as a dictatorship has become widely accepted, while the meaning of the concept dictatorship varies.

Unemployment and homelessness, which had been minimal during the communist era, grew and quickly became widespread; this, as well as the closures of countless factories and other workplaces in the east, fostered a growing sense that East Germans were being ignored or neglected by the federal government.\n\nThese and other effects of unification led many East Germans to begin to think of themselves more strongly as \"East\" Germans rather than as simply \"Germans\". In many former GDR citizens this produced a longing for some aspects of the former East Germany, such as full employment and other perceived benefits of the GDR state, termed \"[[Ostalgie]]\" (a [[Blend word|blend]] of {{lang|de|Ost}} \"east\" and {{lang|de|Nostalgie}} \"nostalgia\") and depicted in the [[Wolfgang Becker]] film ''[[Goodbye Lenin!]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n{{col-begin}}\n\n{{col-1-of-5}}\n'''Germany'''\n* Berlin\n** [[Berlin Wall]]\n** [[East Berlin]]\n** [[West Berlin]]\n* [[History of East Germany]]\n* [[History of Germany since 1945]]\n* [[Inner German border]]\n* [[Iron Curtain]]\n* [[Leaders of East Germany]]\n* [[Ministerrat]]\n* [[West Germany]]\n\n{{col-2-of-5}}\n'''Armed Forces'''\n* [[Conscientious objection in East Germany]]\n* [[Grenztruppen der DDR|Grenztruppen]] (Border troops)\n* [[Landstreitkr\u00e4fte]] (Ground troops)\n* [[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]] (Air Force)\n* [[National People's Army]]\n* [[Stasi]] (Secret police)\n* [[Volksmarine]] (Navy)\n* [[Volkspolizei]] (Police)\n\n{{col-3-of-5}}\n'''Media'''\n* ''[[Aktuelle Kamera]]'', GDR's main TV news show\n* ''[[Der Tunnel]]'', a film about a mass evacuation to West Berlin through a tunnel\n* [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]]\n* [[East German Cold War Propaganda]]\n* ''[[Good Bye, Lenin!]]'', a tragicomedy film about the [[German reunification]]\n* [[Radio Berlin International]]\n* [[Rundfunk der DDR]]\n\n{{col-4-of-5}}\n'''Transport'''\n* [[Barkas (van manufacturer)|Barkas]]\n* [[Deutsche Reichsbahn of the GDR|Deutsche Reichsbahn]]&nbsp;\u2013 The railway company of the GDR\n* [[Interflug]]&nbsp;\u2013 The airline of the GDR\n* [[Trabant]]\n* [[Transport in the German Democratic Republic]]\n* [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]]\n\n{{col-5-of-5}}\n'''Other'''\n* [[Education in the German Democratic Republic]]\n* [[Index of East Germany-related articles]]\n* [[East German jokes|GDR jokes]]\n* [[Ostalgie]] (Nostalgia, missing the DDR)\n* [[Palast der Republik]]\n* [[Dean Reed]]\n* [[Sportvereinigung (SV) Dynamo]]\n* [[Tourism in East Germany]]\n* [[Omoiyari Yosan]] (DDR government\u2192[[USSR]] Forces)\n{{col-end}}\n\n{{Portal|East Germany}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References and bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Allinson, Mark.

Granville is located {{convert|22|km}} west of the [[Sydney central business district]], split between the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]]s of [[Cumberland Council (New South Wales)|Cumberland Council]] and the [[City of Parramatta]].\n\n[[South Granville, New South Wales|South Granville]] is a separate suburb with the distinguishing feature of a light industrial area.  Lisgar, Redfern, Heath and Mona Streets form the approximate border between Granville and South Granville.  The Duck River provides a boundary with [[Auburn, New South Wales|Auburn]], to the east.\n\n== History ==\nGranville was named in 1880, after the British Foreign Secretary, the [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville]].<ref>''Granville: From Forest to Factory'', John Watson (ed.), 1992, Granville Historical Society.</ref>\n\nThe area evolved primarily after 1855, when it became the final stop of the first railway line of New South Wales. The [[Rail transport in New South Wales#Sydney - Parramatta line|Sydney-Parramatta Line]] ran from Sydney terminus, just south from today's [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]] to the Granville area which was originally known as '[[Parramatta]] Junction'. This led to the development of this area, which attracted speculators and some local industries.\n\nIn the early days of European settlement, timber was harvested to fuel the steam engines in Sydney and Parramatta. By the 1860s, the supply of timber was exhausted. The remainder was used by scavengers who made a living by collecting firewood. [[Acacia|Wattle]] bark found use with [[Tanning (leather)|tanners]] and the bark from [[stringybark]] trees was used for roofing of [[Hut (dwelling)|huts]]. In 1862, a major estate, ''Drainville'', became subject to a mortgagee sale and subdivided for villa homes, and small agricultures. At the end of the decade a Tweed Mill was established, which was steam powered using water from the Duck River. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nIn 1878, the locality received its own post office, which was then part of the stationmasters house. In 1880 Parramatta Junction was renamed to Granville, after the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville]]. The place then had a population of 372, of which 176 were male and 196 female. In this era some German settlers, Joseph Klein and P W Merkell, tried to establish [[vineyard]]s in the area, but eventually found the land was not suited for this type of agriculture. More farmers discovered the limitations of the local soils and fruit growers complained about the damage from [[flying fox]]es. Thus, the only practical use for the grasslands, which replaced the original bushland, was for dairy cattle.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nThe [[Municipality of Granville|Granville Municipality]] was formed in 1885 and the council carried on the local government of the area until 1948, when it became part of an enlarged [[City of Parramatta]].\n\nOn [[Anzac Day]] of 1974, Granville was partially severed by flooding of the Duck Creek stormwater channel due to torrential rain that fell over the area. 135 millimetres of rain fell between 11.30&nbsp;pm and 12.30&nbsp;pm at Guildford, with the ensuing flood doing major damage through Granville.<ref>''Duck Creek \u2013 Flooding File'', Sydney Water.</ref> The nearby RSL underwent damage and many of the club's old photographs and honour boards were destroyed.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nGranville is also the location of the [[Granville railway disaster]], which occurred on 18 January 1977 when a commuter train derailed just before the Bold Street overpass and hit the staunchion, causing the bridge to collapse. 83 people perished, making it the worst rail disaster in Australian history.<ref>''Parramatta \u2013 a Past Revealed'', Terry Kass, Carol Liston, John McClymot, 1996, Parramatta City Council.</ref>\n\n===Heritage listings===\nGranville has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* 10 Carlton Street: [[Granville Town Hall]]<ref name=nswshr-1679>{{cite NSW SHR|5054689|Granville Town Hall|hr=01679|fn=S91/02127|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 157 Blaxcell Street: [[Crest Theatre, Granville|Crest Theatre]]<ref name=nswshr-1664>{{cite NSW SHR|5053520|Crest Theatre|hr=01664|fn=H03/00113|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Buildings and places of interest ==\n[[Image:Granville-NSW-StAphanasius.jpg|thumb|St. Aphanasius Ukrainian Autocephalic Orthodox church]]\n\nGranville has a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial developments. The commercial and residential developments are mostly around [[Granville railway station]] and [[Parramatta Road]]. Granville is primarily dominated by freestanding [[weatherboard]], [[fibro]] and unrendered brick buildings. The area is no longer exactly \"typical\" [[quarter acre]] block territory, but {{convert|500|to|600|m2|acre|abbr=on}} blocks are reasonably common. Terraced houses are rare, but increasing in number. Apartment blocks, generally three to four storeys in height, are also becoming more common in the vicinity of the railway station.\n\nBuildings that deserve some attention are:\n\n* ''Granville Town Hall'', which was built in 1888\n* ''The Royal Hotel'' corresponds with the architecture of the Town Hall about 200 m away\n* The ''Brianna's function centre'' building just north of the railway station on Good Street\n* ''St. Marks Anglican Church'' dates back to 1882\n* ''St. Aphanasius Church'', a [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church|Ukrainian Autocephalic Orthodox]] with [[onion dome]]s, adds some interest to William Street. It dates back to 1956.\n* The ''White Palace'' in South Street has an exterior with [[Art Deco]] features. The building was gutted and redeveloped in 2007.\n* The intersecting circles of ''Granville [[Returned and Services League of Australia|RSL]]'' Sub-Branch Building serves as an interesting example of modern architecture.

Almost completely [[self-taught]] in music, he became a composer against his family's wishes. After studying in [[Magdeburg]], [[Zellerfeld]], and [[Hildesheim]], Telemann entered the [[University of Leipzig]] to study law, but eventually settled on a career in music. He held important positions in [[Leipzig]], [[\u017bary|Sorau]], [[Eisenach]], and [[Frankfurt]] before settling in [[Hamburg]] in 1721, where he became musical director of the five main churches. While Telemann's career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died only a few months after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving Telemann.\n\nTelemann is one of the most prolific composers in history<ref>''The Guinness Book of World Records 1998'', Bantam Books, p. 402. {{ISBN|0-553-57895-2}}.</ref> (at least in terms of surviving [[Work of art|oeuvre]])<ref>See Phillip Huscher, [http://www.cso.org/main.taf?p=5,5,6,23 Program Notes \u2013 Telemann'' Tafelmusik'' III] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219000632/http://www.cso.org/main.taf?p=5,5,6,23 |date=19 February 2009 }}, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 2007.</ref> and was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the leading German composers of the time\u2014he was compared favorably both to his friend [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who made Telemann the godfather and namesake of his son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]], and to [[George Frideric Handel]], whom Telemann also knew personally. Telemann's music incorporates several national styles (French, Italian, German) and is even at times influenced by Polish popular music. He remained at the forefront of all new musical tendencies and his music is an important link between the late Baroque and early [[Classical period (music)|Classical styles]].\n\nAs part of his duties, he wrote much music for educating organists under his direction. Including 48 chorale preludes (each setting is set first in two parts set against the hymn as a cantus, then as three-part chorale fugues). 20 small fugues (modal fugues, with a theoretical explanation of the scales, harmonizations, and methods used in composition). They were to accompany his chorale harmonizations for 500 hymns,  published as ''Fast allgemeine evangelisch- musicalisches Lieder-Buch in 1730,'' including chorale melodies and bass lines with thorough-bass figures.  \n \n[[Image:Telemann Signature.png|thumb|Telemann's signature (1714 and 1757)]]\n\n==Early life (1681\u20131712)==\n[[Image:Stadtansicht vor 1720 019.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Magdeburg, Telemann's birthplace, in the early 18th century. Some 50&nbsp;years before Telemann's birth the city was [[Sack of Magdeburg|sacked]] and had to be rebuilt.]]\n\nTelemann was born in [[Magdeburg]], then the capital of the [[Duchy of Magdeburg]], [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. His father Heinrich, [[deacon]] at the Church of the Holy Spirit (''Heilige-Geist-Kirche''), died when Telemann was four. The future composer received his first music lessons at 10, from a local organist, and became immensely interested in music in general, and composition in particular. Despite opposition from his mother and relatives, who forbade any musical activities, Telemann found it possible to study and compose in secret, even creating an opera at age 12.<ref> As Telemann claimed in his autobiography provided to and printed by Johann Mattheson (1681\u20131764) in the latter\u2019s \u201e''Grundlage einer Ehren-Pforte''\u201c (1740), p. 355: \u201c...

Telemann was becoming equally adept both at composing and performing, teaching himself flute, oboe, violin, recorder, double bass, and other instruments. In 1701 he graduated from the Gymnasium and went to Leipzig to become a student at the [[Leipzig University]], where he intended to study law. He ended up becoming a professional musician, regularly composing works for [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig|Nikolaikirche]] and even St. Thomas ([[Thomaskirche]]). In 1702 he became director of the municipal opera house ''Opernhaus auf dem Br\u00fchl'', and later music director at the Neukirche. Prodigiously productive, Telemann supplied a wealth of new music for Leipzig, including several operas, one of which was his first major opera, ''[[Germanicus (opera)|Germanicus]]''. However, he became engaged in a conflict with the cantor of the Thomaskirche, [[Johann Kuhnau]]. The conflict intensified when Telemann started employing numerous students for his projects, including those who were Kuhnau's, from the Thomasschule.<ref>Spitta, Phillip, Johann Sebastian Bach (publ 1873\u20131880) translated from the German (1884\u20131899) by Clara Bell and J.A.

His career there was cut short in early 1706 by the hostilities of the [[Great Northern War]], and after a short period of travels he entered the service of [[John William III, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach|Duke Johann Wilhelm]], in [[Eisenach]] where [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was born. He became ''Konzertmeister'' on 24 December 1708 and Secretary and ''Kapellmeister'' in August 1709. During his tenure at [[Eisenach]], Telemann created a very large amount of music: at least four annual cycles of church cantatas, dozens of sonatas and concertos, and other works. In 1709 he married Amalie Louise Juliane Eberlin, lady-in-waiting to the Countess of Promnitz and daughter of the musician [[Daniel Eberlin]]. Their daughter was born in January 1711. The mother died soon afterwards, leaving Telemann depressed and distraught.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Romain Rolland's Essays on Music|last=Rolland|first=Romain|date=2017|publisher=Allen, Towne & Heath|isbn=9781443730938|location=|page=109|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Frankfurt (1712\u201321)==\nAfter less than a year he sought another position, and moved to [[Frankfurt]] on 18 March 1712 at the age of 31 to become city music director and ''Kapellmeister'' at the Barf\u00fc\u00dferkirche and [[St. Catherine's Church, Frankfurt|St. Catherine's Church]]. In Frankfurt, he fully gained his mature personal style. Here, as in Leipzig, he was a powerful force in the city's musical life, creating music for two major churches, civic ceremonies, and various ensembles and musicians.  By 1720 he had adopted the use of the [[da capo aria]], which had been adopted by composers such as [[Domenico Scarlatti]].  Operas such as ''[[Amor d'un'ombra e gelosia d'un'aura|Narciso]]'', which was brought to Frankfurt in 1719, written in the Italian idiom of composition, made a mark on Telemann's output.<ref name=\"baroquemusic.org\">{{cite web|title=Baroque Composers and musicians|url=http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxtel.html|website=Baroquemusic.org|accessdate=12 February 2016|date=2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 August 1714, three years after his first wife had died, Telemann married his second wife, Maria Catharina Textor, daughter of a Frankfurt council clerk. They eventually had nine children together. This was a source of much personal happiness, and helped him produce compositions. Telemann continued to be extraordinarily productive and successful, even augmenting his income by working for Eisenach employers as a ''[[Kapellmeister]]'' ''von Haus aus'', that is, regularly sending new music while not actually living in Eisenach. Telemann's first published works also appeared during the Frankfurt period. His output increased rapidly, for he fervently composed overture-suites and chamber music, most of which is unappreciated.<ref name=\"baroquemusic.org\"/> In the latter half of the Frankfurt period, he composed an innovative work, his [[Viola Concerto]] in G major, which is twice the length of his violin concertos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/28811.html#tvf=tracks&tv=about|website=Classical Archives|accessdate=3 April 2016|title=Georg Philipp Telemann \u2013 Viola Concerto in G, TWV51:G9}}</ref>  Also, here he composed his first choral masterpiece, his ''[[Brockes Passion]]'', in 1716.\n\n==Hamburg (1721\u201367)==\nThe composer, however, was still ambitious and wishing for a better post, so in 1721 he accepted the invitation to work in [[Hamburg]] as ''Kantor'' of the [[Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums|Johanneum]] [[Lateinschule]], and music director of the five largest churches. Soon after arrival, Telemann encountered some opposition from church officials who found his secular music and activities to be too much of a distraction for both Telemann himself and the townsfolk. The next year, when [[Johann Kuhnau]] died and the city of Leipzig was looking for a new ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', Telemann applied for the job and was approved, yet declined after Hamburg authorities agreed to give him a suitable raise. After another candidate, [[Christoph Graupner]], declined, the post went to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].\n\n[[Image:Georg Philipp Telemann by Georg Lichtensteger.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Telemann c. 1745, engraving by Georg Lichtensteger]]\n\nTelemann took a few small trips outside of Germany at this time. However, later in the Hamburg period he traveled to Paris and stayed for eight months, 1737 into 1738.  He heard and was impressed by ''[[Castor et Pollux]]'', an opera by French composer [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]. From then on, he incorporated the French operatic style into his vocal works. Before then, his influence was primarily Italian and German.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wollny|first1=Peter|title=Notes on Telemann's St. Matthew Passion|date=1994|publisher=hannsler classic|pages=12\u201315}}</ref> Apart from that, Telemann remained in Hamburg for the rest of his life.  A vocal masterpiece of this period is his ''St Luke Passion'' from 1728, which is a prime example of his fully matured vocal style.\n\nHis first years there were plagued by marital troubles: his wife's infidelity, and her gambling debts, which amounted to a sum larger than Telemann's annual income. The composer was saved from bankruptcy by the efforts of his friends, and by the numerous successful music and poetry publications Telemann made during the years 1725 to 1740. By 1736 husband and wife were no longer living together because of their financial disagreements. Although still active and fulfilling the many duties of his job, Telemann became less productive in the 1740s, for he was in his 60s. He took up theoretical studies, as well as hobbies such as gardening and cultivating exotic plants, something of a fad in Hamburg at that time, and a hobby shared by Handel.\nMost of the music of the 1750s appears to have been parodied from earlier works. Telemann's eldest son Andreas died in 1755, and Andreas' son [[Georg Michael Telemann]] was raised by the aging composer. Troubled by health problems and failing eyesight in his last years, Telemann was still composing into the 1760s. He died on the evening of 25 June 1767 from what was recorded at the time as a \"chest ailment.\" He was succeeded at his Hamburg post by his godson, Johann Sebastian Bach's second son [[Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach]].\n\n==Legacy and influence==\nTelemann was one of the most prolific major composers of all time:<ref>[http://www.classicfm.com/composers/telemann/ Profile on '' Classic FM'' website]</ref> his all-encompassing oeuvre comprises more than 3,000 compositions, half of which have been lost, and most of which have not been performed since the 18th century. From 1708 to 1750, Telemann composed 1,043 sacred cantatas and 600 overture-suites, and types of concertos for combinations of instruments that no other composer of the time employed.<ref name=\"baroquemusic.org\"/> The first accurate estimate of the number of his works was provided by musicologists only during the 1980s and 1990s, when extensive thematic catalogues were published. During his lifetime and the latter half of the 18th century, Telemann was very highly regarded by colleagues and critics alike. Numerous theorists ([[Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg|Marpurg]], [[Johann Mattheson|Mattheson]], [[Johann Joachim Quantz|Quantz]], and [[Johann Adolph Scheibe|Scheibe]], among others) cited his works as models, and major composers such as [[J.S. Bach]] and [[Handel]] bought and studied his published works. He was immensely popular not only in Germany but also in the rest of Europe: orders for editions of Telemann's music came from [[France]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[Switzerland]], and [[Spain]]. It was only in the early 19th century that his popularity came to a sudden halt. Most lexicographers started dismissing him as a \"[[Polygraph (author)|polygraph]]\" who composed too many works, a ''Vielschreiber'' for whom quantity came before quality. Such views were influenced by an account of Telemann's music by [[Christoph Daniel Ebeling]], a late-18th-century critic who in fact praised Telemann's music and made only passing critical remarks of his productivity. After the Bach revival, Telemann's works were judged as inferior to Bach's and lacking in deep religious feeling.<ref name=\"groveonline\">Zohn, GroveOnline.</ref> For example, by 1911, the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' lacked an article about Telemann, and in one of its few mentions of him referred to \"the vastly inferior work of lesser composers such as Telemann\" in comparison to Handel and Bach.<ref>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Song? See article \"Song\" in 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123090045/http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Song |date=23 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nParticularly striking examples of such judgements were produced by noted Bach biographers [[Philipp Spitta]] and [[Albert Schweitzer]], who criticized Telemann's cantatas and then praised works they thought were composed by Bach, but which were composed by Telemann.<ref name=\"groveonline\"/> The last performance of a substantial work by Telemann (''[[Der Tod Jesu]]'') occurred in 1832, and it was not until the 20th century that his music started being performed again. The revival of interest in Telemann began in the first decades of the 20th century and culminated in the B\u00e4renreiter critical edition of the 1950s. Today each of Telemann's works is usually given a [[TWV]] number, which stands for ''Telemann-Werke-Verzeichnis'' (Telemann Works Catalogue).\n\nTelemann's music was one of the driving forces behind the late Baroque and the early Classical styles. Starting in the 1710s he became one of the creators and foremost exponents of the so-called German mixed style, an amalgam of German, French, Italian and Polish styles. Over the years, his music gradually changed and started incorporating more and more elements of the galant style, but he never completely adopted the ideals of the nascent Classical era: Telemann's style remained contrapuntally and harmonically complex, and already in 1751 he dismissed much contemporary music as too simplistic. Composers he influenced musically included pupils of J.S. Bach in Leipzig, such as [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]], [[Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach]] and [[Johann Friedrich Agricola]], as well as those composers who performed under his direction in Leipzig ([[Christoph Graupner]], [[Johann David Heinichen]] and [[Johann Georg Pisendel]]), composers of the Berlin ''lieder'' school, and finally, his numerous pupils, none of whom, however, became major composers.\n\nEqually important for the history of music were Telemann's publishing activities. By pursuing exclusive publication rights for his works, he set one of the most important early precedents for regarding music as the intellectual property of the composer. The same attitude informed his public concerts, where Telemann would frequently perform music originally composed for ceremonies attended only by a select few members of the upper class.\n\n==Partial list of works==\n{{see also|Telemann-Werke-Verzeichnis}}\n\n===Operas===\nSee '''[[List of operas by Georg Philipp Telemann]]'''\n\n===Passions===\n* ''[[Georg Philipp Telemann's Passions]]''\n\n===Cantatas===\n* ''[[Cantata Cycle 1716-1717 (Telemann)|Cantata Cycle 1716\u20131717]]''\n* ''[[Harmonischer Gottes-Dienst]]''\n* ''Die Donner-Ode'' (\"The Ode of Thunder\") TWV 6:3a-b\n* ''Du bleibest dennoch unser Gott'' (Erstausgabe 1730)\n* ''Ihr V\u00f6lker, h\u00f6rt''\n* ''Ino'' (1765)\n* ''Sei tausendmal willkommen'' (Erstausgabe 1730)\n* ''Die Tageszeiten'' (\"The Times of the Day\") (1757)\n* ''Gott, man lobet dich, Cantata for the Peace of Paris, 1763, for 5-part chorus, flute, 2 oboes, bassoon, 3 trumpets, 2 horns, strings & continuo, TWV 14:12\n** not by Telemann: ''Der Schulmeister'' (\"The Schoolmaster\" 1751), by [[Christoph Ludwig Fehre]].\n\n===Oratorios===\n* ''[[Admiralit\u00e4tsmusik|Hamburger Admiralit\u00e4tsmusik]]'' several years including TWV 24:1\n* ''Der Tag des Gerichts'' (\"The Day of Judgement\") (1761\u201362)\n* ''[[Kapit\u00e4nsmusik|Hamburgische Kapit\u00e4nsmusik]]'' (various years)\n* ''Der Tod Jesu'' (\"The Death of Jesus\") TWV 5:6 (1755)\n* ''Die Auferstehung und Himmelfahrt Jesu\"'' (\"The Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus\") TWV 6:6, (1760)\n* Trauermusik for emperor [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Karl VII]] (1745) ''Ich hoffete aufs Licht'', TWV 4:13\n* Trauermusik for Hamburg mayor [[:nl:Garlieb Sillem]] Schwanengesang TWV 4:6\n* ''Der aus der L\u00f6wengrube errettete Daniel'' (\"Daniel Delivered from the Lion\u2019s Den\") (1731) [This has been incorrectly attributed to Handel]\n* Reformations-Oratorium 1755 ''Holder Friede, Heilger Glaube'' TWV 13:18<ref>Concerto: Das Magazin f\u00fcr Alte Musik, Vol. 22, p. 14  2005 Am 24.

His \"Fugues l\u00e9g\u00e8res & petits jeux, TWV 30:21\u201326\", are six simple suites with a simple, mostly two-part fugue as the opening movement. The 36 Fantasias in 3 sets of 12, are written, both as  performance pieces, and often as progressive studies (the third dozen are the most accessible).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n*36 Fantasias for Keyboard TWV 33:1-36 https://imslp.org/wiki/36_Fantaisies_pour_le_clavessin,_TWV_33:1-36_(Telemann,_Georg_Philipp)\n*6 Overtures for Keyboard TWV 32:5-10 https://imslp.org/wiki/6_Overtures_for_Clavier,_TWV_32:5-10_(Telemann,_Georg_Philipp)\n*6 Light Fugues with Small Fresh Additions TWV 30:21-26 https://imslp.org/wiki/Fugues_l%C3%A9g%C3%A8res_%26_petits_jeux,_TWV_30:21-26_(Telemann,_Georg_Philipp)\n\n=== Organ and Theoretical ===\n\n*48 Chorale Preludes for Organ TWV 31:1-48 https://imslp.org/wiki/Organ_Works_(Telemann%2C_Georg_Philipp)\n*20 easy fugues in 4 parts TWV 30:1-20 https://imslp.org/wiki/Organ_Works_(Telemann%2C_Georg_Philipp)\n*500 chorale harmonizations https://imslp.org/wiki/Fast_allgemeines_Evangelisch-Musicalisches_Lieder-Buch_(Telemann%2C_Georg_Philipp)\n\n===Concertos===\n\n====Violin====\n* Violin Concerto in A Major \"Die Relinge\" TWV 51:A4\n* Concerto for Three Violins in F major, TWV 53:F1\n* [[4 Concertos for 4 Violins (Telemann)|Four Concertos for Four Violins]] TWV 40:201\u2013204\n\n====Viola====\n* [[Viola Concerto (Telemann)|Concerto in G Major]] for Viola and String Orchestra, TWV 51:G9; the first known concerto for viola, still regularly performed today\n* [[Concerto for 2 violas (Telemann)|Concerto in G Major]] for Two Violas and String Orchestra, TWV 52:G3\n\n====Horn====\n* Concerto for Two Horns in D Major TWV 52:D1\n* Concerto for Two Horns in D Major TWV 52:D2\n* Concerto for Horn and Orchestra in D Major 51:D8\n\n====Trumpet====\n* Trumpet Concerto in D major, 51:D 7\n* Concerto in D for Trumpet and 2 Oboes, 53:D 2\n* Concerto in D for Trumpet, Violin and Violoncello, 53:D 5\n* Concerto in D for 3 Trumpets, Timpani, 2 Oboes, 54:D 3\n* Concerto in D for 3 Trumpets, Timpani, 54:D 4\n\n====Chalumeau====\n* Concerto in C major for 2 Chalumeaux, 2 Bassoons and Orchestra, 52:C 1\n* Concerto in D minor for Two Chalumeaux and Orchestra, 52:d 1\n\n====Oboe====\n* Concerto in A Major\n* Concerto in C Minor\n* Concerto in D Minor\n* Concerto in E Minor\n* Concerto in F Minor\n* Concerto in G Major\n\n====Bassoon====\n* Concerto for Recorder and Bassoon in F Major, TWV52:F1\n\n====Recorder====\n* Concerto in C Major, TWV51:C1\n* Concerto in F Major, TWV51:F1\n* Concerto for Recorder and Viola da gamba in A Minor, TWV52:a1\n* Concerto for 2 Recorders in A Minor, TWV52:a2\n* Concerto for 2 Recorders in B-flat Major, TWV52:B1\n\n====Flute====\n* Concerto in D Major, TWV 51:D2\n* Concerto in E Minor for Recorder and Flute, TWV 52:e1\n* Concerto in B Minor, TWV 41:h3\n* Concerto in C Minor, TWV 41:c3\n\n=== Sonatas ===\nSonata da chiesa, TWV 41:g5 (for Melodic instrument - Violin, Flute or Oboe, from ''Der getreue Musikmeister'')\n\n==== Oboe ====\n* Sonata in A minor TWV 41:a3 (from ''Der getreue Musikmeister'')\n* Sonata in B-flat TWV 41:B6\n* Sonata in E minor TWV 44:e6\n* Sonata in G minor TWV 41:g6\n* Sonata in G minor TWV 41:g10\n\n==== Bassoon ====\n* Sonata in F minor TWV 41:f1 (part of the collection ''Der getreue Musikmeister'', 1728)\n* Sonata in E-flat major TWV 41:EsA1\n\n==Media==\n{{multi-listen start}}\n{{multi-listen item|filename= Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) - Concerto for Recorder and Viola da Gamba, TWV 52a1.ogg|title= Georg Philipp Telemann (1681\u20131767) \u2013 Concerto for Recorder and Viola da Gamba, TWV 52:a1|description=Performed by New Comma Baroque|format=[[ogg]]}}\n{{multi-listen item|filename=Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) - Concerto No.2 in D-Major, TWV 43D1.ogg|title= Georg Philipp Telemann (1681\u20131767) \u2013 Concerto No.2 in D-Major, TWV 43:D1 from the Six quatuors a violon, flute, viole ou violoncello et basse continue (Hamburg, 1730, Paris, 1736)|description=Performed by New Comma Baroque|format=[[ogg]]}}\n{{multi-listen item|filename=Telemann - 2violin Sonata 1-1.ogg|title=Two Violin Sonata 1, movement 1|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n{{multi-listen item|filename=Telemann - 2violin Sonata 1-2.ogg|title=Two Violin Sonata 1, movement 2|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n{{multi-listen item|filename=Telemann - 2violin Sonata 1-3.ogg|title=Two Violin Sonata 1, movement 3|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n{{multi-listen item|filename=Telemann - 2violin Sonata 1-4.ogg|title=Two Violin Sonata 1, movement 4|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n{{multi-listen item|filename=Telemann - Concert Suite in D major TWV55D6 - 1.

The operation lasted from 8:12am Tuesday until 6:00am Thursday. Ultimately, 84 people were killed in the accident which included an unborn child.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe bridge was rebuilt as a single span without any intermediate support piers. Other bridges similar to the destroyed bridge had their piers reinforced.\n[[File:Granville railway bridge.JPG|thumb|right|The replacement bridge]]\n\nThe original inquiry into the accident found that the primary cause of the crash was \"the very unsatisfactory condition of the permanent way\", being the poor fastening of the track, causing the track to spread and allowing the left front wheel of the locomotive to come off the rail.  However, some 30 years later research for a book uncovered what was always referred to as a cover-up. Finding evidence that the real cause is believed to be a lack of maintenance to the 46 class loco, having a faulty L6 wheel which was found to be unserviceable in August 1976.  As no replacement was available it was decided that it would be allowed to remain in service but would be kept under surveillance. It just so happened on the day of the disaster the L6 wheel was the steering wheel and it is believed that as it approached a crossover point known as Lead 73, it climbed the track putting the loco into its fatal direction. How this happened was related to the lack of spare wheels which had been sold off for scrap to raise funds for the Public Transport Commissions' budget.\n\nOther contributing factors included the structure of the bridge itself. When built, the base of its deck was found to be one metre lower than the road. Concrete was added on top to build the surface up level with the road.{{fact|date=November 2016}} This additional weight significantly added to the destruction of the wooden train carriages. The disaster prompted substantial increases in rail-maintenance expenditure. The train driver, Edward Olencewicz, was exonerated by the inquiry.\n\nFor 39 years, the people of the disaster had little to say until the Granville Train Disaster Association Inc. was formed. This was to represent the emotions of those affected (including relatives and friends) via Barry J Gobbe OAM [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] and Meredith Knight JP to the Minister for Transport, Andrew Constance and New South Wales Premier, Gladys Berejiklian and requested an apology for the way the real people of the disaster were treated by the then Wran Government of the day.

(GTDA). This coincided with changes in local government and legislative changes along with Traffic management legislation and insurance responsibilities. Due to the restructure of Parramatta City Council, Holroyd Council and the Auburn council with amalgamation came a rezoning of areas.  This would now mean that the Granville Memorial site would now fall under the control of the newly formed Cumberland Council.  As Parramatta City Council who had been the main supporter of the event for some 39 years, financing and supplying staff to assist each year, Cumberland Council decided that the Memorial Services would not be an event under their administration management and advised the GTDA who are a collection of volunteers who were directly involved with the disaster, to apply for a council events grant if they wished the annual services to continue, simply stating that this was not a documented council event, even though over 100 people gather on their council footpath at the memorial wall every year to remember and respect those who perished on that fateful day in 1977 in the now Cumberland Council area. The decision by the Cumberland Council administration was then challenged by the GTDA with the support of the newly formed Cumberland Council elected councillors. On the 6/6/2018 councillors, Hamed & Elmore put forward a motion that 'council fully support the annual memorial service with the assistance of the GTDA'. It was also amended and noted, to invite assistance from Parramatta City Council and the NSW State Government. The motion was unanimously carried by all councillors present.           http://www.granvilletraindisaster.info/\n\n==In media==\n* A television [[docudrama]], ''[[The Day of the Roses]]'', was produced in 1998 about the accident.\n* A television [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''The Train'', produced by Graham McNeice was aired in 2012 on [[The History Channel Australia]] about the accident, and narrated by [[Brian Henderson (television presenter)|Brian Henderson]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/the-way-it-is-brian-henderson-back-for-tv-doco-20121212-2b95f.html#ixzz2OUuO01MI The way it is: Brian Henderson back for TV doco  | The Sydney Morning Herald 12 December 2012.

Among his best-known works are the orchestral compositions ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (1924) and ''[[An American in Paris]]'' (1928), as well as the contemporary opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935).\n\nGershwin studied piano under [[Charles Hambitzer]] and composition with [[Rubin Goldmark]], [[Henry Cowell]] and Joseph Brody. He began his career as a [[song plugger]], but soon started composing [[Broadway theatre]] works with his brother [[Ira Gershwin]] and [[Buddy DeSylva]]. He moved to [[Paris]] intending to study with [[Nadia Boulanger]], who refused him, where he subsequently composed ''An American in Paris''. After returning to [[New York City]], he wrote ''Porgy and Bess'', with Ira, and the author [[DuBose Heyward]]. Initially a commercial failure, ''Porgy and Bess'' later went on to be considered one of the most important American operas of the Twentieth century, and an American cultural classic.\n\nGershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous [[film score]]s until his death in 1937 from [[glioblastoma multiforme]], a malignant brain tumor.<ref>Carp L.

Am J Surg Pathol 1979; 3: 473-478.</ref>\n\nGershwin's compositions have been adapted for use in many films and for television, and several became jazz standards recorded and covered in many variations. Many celebrated singers and musicians have performed his songs.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Ancestors===\nGershwin was of [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] and [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] ancestry. His grandfather, Jakov Gershowitz, had served for 25 years as a mechanic for the [[Imperial Russian Army]] to earn the right of free travel and residence as a Jew; finally retiring near [[Saint Petersburg]]. His teenage son, Moishe Gershowitz, worked as a leather cutter for women's shoes. Moishe Gershowitz met and fell in love with Roza Bruskina, the teenage daughter of a furrier in [[Vilnius]]. She and her family moved to New York due to increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in Russia, changing her first name to Rose. Moishe, faced with compulsory military service if he remained in Russia, moved to America as soon as he could afford to. Once in New York, he changed his first name to Morris. Gershowitz lived with a maternal uncle in Brooklyn, working as a foreman in a women's shoe factory. He married Rose on July 21, 1895, and Gershowitz soon Americanized his name to Gershwine.{{sfn|Hyland|2003|pp=1\u20133}}{{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Jablonski|1987|pp=29\u201331}}\nTheir first child, [[Ira Gershwin]], was born on December 6, 1896, after which the family moved into a second-floor apartment on Brooklyn's Snediker Avenue.\n\n===Early life===\nOn September 26, 1898, George was born as second son to Morris and Rose Bruskin Gershwine in their second-floor apartment on Brooklyn's Snediker Avenue. His birth certificate identifies him as Jacob Gershwine, with the surname pronounced 'Gersh-vin' in the Russian and Yiddish immigrant community. He had just one given name, contrary to the American practice of giving children both a first and middle name.  He was named after his grandfather, a one time Russian army mechanic. He soon became known as George, and changed the spelling of his surname to 'Gershwin' about the time he became a professional musician; other family members followed suit.{{sfn|Jablonski|1987|pp=10, 29\u201331}} After Ira and George, another boy [[Arthur Gershwin]] (1900\u20131981), and a girl [[Frances Gershwin]] (1906\u20131999) were born into the family.\n\nThe family lived in many different residences, as their father changed dwellings with each new enterprise in which he became involved. Mostly, they grew up around the [[Yiddish Theater District]]. George and Ira frequented the local Yiddish theaters, with George occasionally appearing onstage as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]].{{sfn|Pollack|2006}}<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ClbSVEha8gC&pg=PT199 |title=The Rough Guide to New York City |author=Andrew Rosenberg, Martin Dunford |publisher=Penguin |year= 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/loc/Gershwin.html |title=Judaic Treasures of the Library of Congress: George Gershwin |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |year=2013 |accessdate=March 10, 2013}} As quoted from Abraham J.

Until 1908, he cared nothing for music, when as a ten-year-old he was intrigued upon hearing his friend Maxie Rosenzweig's violin recital.<ref>{{cite book |title= Gershwin, His Life and Music|last=Schwartz |first=Charles |year=1973 |publisher=Da Capo Press, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-306-80096-9 |page=14}}</ref> The sound, and the way his friend played, captured him.  At around the same time, George's parents had bought a piano for lessons for his older brother Ira, but to his parents' surprise, and Ira's relief, it was George who spent more time playing it.{{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=13}}\n\nAlthough his younger sister Frances was the first in the family to make a living through her musical talents, she married young and devoted herself to being a mother and housewife, thus surrendering any serious time to musical endeavors. Having given up her performing career, she settled upon painting as a creative outlet, which had also been a hobby George briefly pursued. [[Arthur Gershwin]] followed in the paths of George and Ira, also becoming a composer of songs, musicals, and short piano works.\n\nWith a degree of frustration, George tried various piano teachers for some two years (circa. 1911) before finally being introduced to [[Charles Hambitzer]] by Jack Miller (circa. 1913), the pianist in the Beethoven Symphony Orchestra.  Until his death in 1918, Hambitzer remained Gershwin's musical mentor and taught him conventional piano technique, introduced him to music of the European classical tradition, and encouraged him to attend orchestral concerts.{{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=14}} Following such concerts, young Gershwin would essentially try to play, on the piano at home, the music he had heard from recall, and without sheet music.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} As a matter of course, Gershwin later studied with the classical composer [[Rubin Goldmark]] and avant-garde composer-theorist [[Henry Cowell]], thus formalizing his classical music training.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Tin Pan Alley and Broadway, 1913\u20131923===\n{|align=right\n|{{Listen\n|filename=Al Jolson, George Gershwin, Irving Caesar, Swanee 1920.ogg\n|title=Swanee\n|description=[[Al Jolson]]'s hit 1920 recording of George Gershwin and [[Irving Caesar]]'s 1919 \"[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]\".\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n|}\nIn 1913, Gershwin left school at the age of 15 and found his first job as a \"[[song plugger]]\".

He produced dozens, if not hundreds, of rolls under his own and assumed names (pseudonyms attributed to Gershwin include Fred Murtha and Bert Wynn). He also recorded rolls of his own compositions for the Duo-Art and [[Welte-Mignon]] [[reproducing piano]]s. As well as recording piano rolls, Gershwin made a brief foray into [[vaudeville]], accompanying both [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Louise Dresser]] on the piano.<ref>Slide, Anthony.

The two collaborated on the Broadway musicals ''Piccadilly to Broadway'' (1920) and ''For Goodness' Sake'' (1922), and jointly composed the score for ''Our Nell'' (1923). This was the beginning of a long friendship.

It was orchestrated by [[Ferde Grof\u00e9]] and premiered by [[Paul Whiteman]]'s Concert Band, in New York.  It subsequently went on to be his most popular work, and established Gershwin's signature style and genius in blending vastly different musical styles in revolutionary ways.\n\nSince the early 1920s, Gershwin frequently worked with the lyricist [[Buddy DeSylva]]. Together they created the experimental one-act jazz opera ''[[Blue Monday (opera)|Blue Monday]],'' set in Harlem.  It is widely regarded as a forerunner to the groundbreaking ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''. In 1924, George and Ira Gershwin collaborated on a stage musical comedy ''[[Lady Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]'', which included such future [[Jazz standards|standards]] as \"[[Fascinating Rhythm]]\" and \"[[Oh, Lady Be Good!]]\".<ref>{{ibdb show|title=Lady, Be Good|id=5227}}.

They were afraid that rigorous classical study would ruin his [[jazz]]-influenced style.{{sfn|Jablonski|1987|pp=155\u2013170}} Maurice Ravel's rejection letter to Gershwin told him, \"Why become a second-rate Ravel when you're already a first-rate Gershwin?\" While there, Gershwin wrote ''[[An American in Paris]]''.

With the exception of several minor speaking roles, all of the characters are African-American.  The music combines elements of popular music of the day, with a strong influence of African-American music, of the period, with techniques typical of opera, such as [[recitative]], [[through-composition]] and an extensive system of [[leitmotif]]s. ''Porgy and Bess'' contains some of Gershwin's most sophisticated music, including a [[fugue]], a [[passacaglia]], the use of [[atonality]], [[polytonality]] and [[polyrhythm]], and a [[tone row]]. Even the \"set numbers\" (of which \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\", \"I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'\" and \"[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]\" are well known examples) are some of the most refined and ingenious of Gershwin's compositions.

The work was first performed in 1935; it was a box-office failure in the middle of the [[Great Depression]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Last years, 1936\u201337===\nAfter the commercial failure of ''Porgy and Bess'', Gershwin moved to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], California. In 1936, he was commissioned by [[RKO Pictures]] to write the music for the film ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'', starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. Gershwin's extended score, which would marry ballet with [[jazz]] in a new way, runs over an hour in length. It took Gershwin several months to compose and orchestrate.\n\nGershwin had a ten-year affair with composer [[Kay Swift]], whom he frequently consulted about his music. The two never married, although she eventually divorced her husband [[James Warburg]] in order to commit to the relationship. Swift's granddaughter, Katharine Weber, has suggested that the pair were not married because George's mother Rose was \"unhappy that Kay Swift wasn't Jewish\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Sidney Offit|url=http://momentmag.com/moment/issues/2011/10/book_memory.html|title=Sins of Our Fathers (and Grandmothers) |work=Moment Magazine|date=September\u2013October 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2011|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011080733/http://momentmag.com/moment/issues/2011/10/book_memory.html|archivedate=October 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''Oh, Kay'' was named for her.{{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=108}} After Gershwin's death, Swift arranged some of his music, transcribed several of his recordings, and collaborated with his brother Ira on several projects.<ref>[http://www.kayswift.com/bio.html ''Kay Swift biography'' (Kay Swift Memorial Trust)]. kayswift.com. Retrieved December 28, 2007.</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\nEarly in 1937, Gershwin began to complain of blinding headaches and a recurring impression that he smelled burning rubber. On February 11, 1937, he performed his Piano Concerto in F in a special concert of his music with the [[San Francisco Symphony]] Orchestra under the direction of French maestro [[Pierre Monteux]].{{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=353}} Gershwin, normally a superb pianist in his own compositions, suffered coordination problems and blackouts during the performance. He was at the time working on other Hollywood film projects while living with Ira and his wife Leonore in their rented house in [[Beverly Hills]]. Leonore Gershwin began to be disturbed by George's mood swings and his seeming inability to eat without spilling food at the dinner table. She suspected mental illness and insisted he be moved out of their house to lyricist Yip Harburg's empty quarters nearby, where he was placed in the care of his valet, Paul Mueller. The headaches and [[olfactory hallucination]]s continued.\n\nOn June 23, 1937 after an incident in which Gershwin tried to push Mueller out of the car in which they were riding, he was admitted to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center|Cedars of Lebanon Hospital]] in Los Angeles for observation.  Tests showed no physical cause and he was released on the 26th with a diagnosis of \"likely hysteria\".  His troubles with coordination and mental acuity worsened, though. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nOn the night of July 9, 1937 Gershwin collapsed in Harburg's house, where he had been working on the score of ''[[The Goldwyn Follies]]''.

Only then did his doctors think that he was suffering from a [[brain tumor]]. Leonore called George's close friend Emil Mosbacher and explained the dire need to find a neurosurgeon. Mosbacher immediately called pioneering neurosurgeon [[Harvey Cushing]] in Boston, who, retired for several years by then, recommended Dr. [[Walter Dandy]], who was on a boat fishing in [[Chesapeake Bay]] with the governor of [[Maryland]].

From left: [[Oskar Fried]]; [[\u00c9va Gauthier]]; Ravel at piano; [[Manoah Leide-Tedesco]]; and George Gershwin.]]\nGershwin was influenced by French composers of the early twentieth century. In turn [[Maurice Ravel]] was impressed with Gershwin's abilities, commenting, \"Personally I find jazz most interesting: the rhythms, the way the melodies are handled, the melodies themselves. I have heard of George Gershwin's works and I find them intriguing.\"{{sfn|Mawer|Cross|2000|p=42}} The [[orchestration]]s in Gershwin's symphonic works often seem similar to those of Ravel; likewise, Ravel's two piano concertos evince an influence of Gershwin.\n\nGeorge Gershwin asked to study with Ravel. When Ravel heard how much Gershwin earned, Ravel replied with words to the effect of, \"You should give ''me'' lessons.\" (Some versions of this story feature [[Igor Stravinsky]] rather than Ravel as the composer; however Stravinsky confirmed that he originally heard the story from Ravel.)<ref>Arthur Rubinstein, ''My Many Years''; Merle Armitage, ''George Gershwin''; Igor Stravinsky and Robert Craft, ''Dialogues and a Diary'', all quoted in Norman Lebrecht, ''The Book of Musical Anecdotes''</ref>\n\nGershwin's own ''[[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]'' was criticized for being related to the work of [[Claude Debussy]], more so than to the expected jazz style. The comparison did not deter him from continuing to explore French styles. The title of ''[[An American in Paris]]'' reflects the very journey that he had consciously taken as a composer: \"The opening part will be developed in typical French style, in the manner of Debussy and ''[[Les Six]]'', though the tunes are original.\"{{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=126}}\n\nAside from the French influence, Gershwin was intrigued by the works of [[Alban Berg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Darius Milhaud]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. He also asked Schoenberg for composition lessons. Schoenberg refused, saying \"I would only make you a bad Schoenberg, and you're such a good Gershwin already.\"<ref>Norman Lebrecht, ''The Book of Musical Anecdotes''</ref> (This quote is similar to one credited to [[Maurice Ravel]] during Gershwin's 1928 visit to France \u2013 \"Why be a second-rate Ravel, when you are a first-rate Gershwin?\") Gershwin was particularly impressed by the music of Berg, who gave him a score of the ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]''. He attended the American premiere of ''[[Wozzeck]]'', conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]] in 1931, and was \"thrilled and deeply impressed\".<ref>Howard Pollack, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RySwdc151ZoC&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145#v=onepage&q=wozzeck%20gershwin George Gershwin: His Life and Work, p. 145]. Retrieved 20 June 2016</ref>\n\nRussian [[Joseph Schillinger]]'s influence as Gershwin's teacher of composition (1932\u20131936) was substantial in providing him with a method of composition. There has been some disagreement about the nature of Schillinger's influence on Gershwin. After the posthumous success of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', Schillinger claimed he had a large and direct influence in overseeing the creation of the opera; Ira completely denied that his brother had any such assistance for this work. A third account of Gershwin's musical relationship with his teacher was written by Gershwin's close friend [[Vernon Duke]], also a Schillinger student, in an article for ''[[the Musical Quarterly]]'' in 1947.<ref>Dukelsky, Vladimir (Vernon Duke), [http://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXXIII/1/102 \"Gershwin, Schillinger and Dukelsky: Some Reminiscences\"], ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'', Volume 33, 1947, 102\u2013115 {{doi|10.1093/mq/XXXIII.1.102}}</ref>\n\nWhat set Gershwin apart was his ability to manipulate forms of music into his own unique voice. He took the jazz he discovered on [[Tin Pan Alley]] into the mainstream by splicing its rhythms and tonality with that of the popular songs of his era. Although George Gershwin would seldom make grand statements about his music, he believed that \"true music must reflect the thought and aspirations of the people and time. My people are Americans. My time is today.\"<ref name=balletmet>[http://www.balletmet.org/Notes/GeorgeG.html \"George Gershwin\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504192023/http://www.balletmet.org/Notes/GeorgeG.html |date=May 4, 2010 }} balletmet.org, (Compiled February 2000). Retrieved April 20, 2010</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the [[Library of Congress]] named their [[Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song|Prize for Popular Song]] after George and Ira Gershwin. Recognizing the profound and positive effect of popular music on culture, the prize is given annually to a composer or performer whose lifetime contributions exemplify the standard of excellence associated with the Gershwins. On March 1, 2007, the first Gershwin Prize was awarded to [[Paul Simon]].<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/previews/paulsimon/ \"Paul Simon: The Library Of Congress Gershwin Prize For Popular Song\"], PBS article</ref>\n\n==Recordings and film==\nEarly in his career, under both his own name and pseudonyms, Gershwin recorded more than one hundred and forty [[player piano]] [[piano rolls|rolls]] which were a main source of his income. The majority were popular music of the period and a smaller proportion were of his own works. Once his musical theatre-writing income became substantial, his regular roll-recording career became superfluous. He did record additional rolls throughout the 1920s of his main hits for the Aeolian Company's reproducing piano, including a complete version of his ''Rhapsody in Blue''.\n\nCompared to the piano rolls, there are few accessible audio recordings of Gershwin's playing. His first recording was his own \"Swanee\" with the Fred Van Eps Trio in 1919. The recorded balance highlights the banjo playing of Van Eps, and the piano is overshadowed. The recording took place before \"Swanee\" became famous as an Al Jolson specialty in early 1920.\n\nGershwin recorded an abridged version of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' with [[Paul Whiteman]] and his orchestra for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1924, soon after the world premiere. Gershwin and the same orchestra made an electrical recording of the abridged version for Victor in 1927. However, a dispute in the studio over interpretation angered Whiteman and he left. The conductor's baton was taken over by Victor's staff conductor [[Nathaniel Shilkret]].{{sfn|Peyser|2007|p=133}}\n\nGershwin made a number of solo piano recordings of tunes from his musicals, some including the vocals of Fred and Adele Astaire, as well as his ''[[Three Preludes (Gershwin)|Three Preludes]]'' for piano. In 1929, Gershwin \"supervised\" the world premiere recording of ''An American in Paris'' with Nathaniel Shilkret and the Victor Symphony Orchestra. Gershwin's role in the recording was rather limited, particularly because Shilkret was conducting and had his own ideas about the music. When it was realized that no one had been hired to play the brief [[celesta|celeste]] solo, Gershwin was asked if he could and would play the instrument, and he agreed. Gershwin can be heard, rather briefly, on the recording during the slow section.\n\nGershwin appeared on several radio programs, including [[Rudy Vallee]]'s, and played some of his compositions. This included the third movement of the ''Concerto in F'' with Vallee conducting the studio orchestra. Some of these performances were preserved on [[transcription disc]]s and have been released on LP and CD.\n\nIn 1934, in an effort to earn money to finance his planned folk opera, Gershwin hosted his own radio program titled ''Music by Gershwin''. The show was broadcast on the [[NBC Blue Network]] from February to May and again in September through the final show on December 23, 1934. He presented his own work as well as the work of other composers.{{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=163}} Recordings from this and other radio broadcasts include his ''Variations on I Got Rhythm'', portions of the ''Concerto in F'', and numerous songs from his musical comedies. He also recorded a run-through of his ''Second Rhapsody'', conducting the orchestra and playing the piano solos. Gershwin recorded excerpts from ''Porgy and Bess'' with members of the original cast, conducting the orchestra from the keyboard; he even announced the selections and the names of the performers. In 1935 [[RCA Victor]] asked him to supervise recordings of highlights from ''Porgy and Bess''; these were his last recordings.\n\nA 74-second newsreel film clip of Gershwin playing ''I Got Rhythm'' has survived, filmed at the opening of the Manhattan Theater (now The [[Ed Sullivan Theater]]) in August 1931.{{sfn|Jablonski|Stewart|1973|p=70}} There are also silent home movies of Gershwin, some of them shot on [[Kodachrome]] color film stock, which have been featured in tributes to the composer. In addition, there is newsreel footage of Gershwin playing \"Mademoiselle from New Rochelle\" and \"[[Strike Up the Band (song)|Strike Up the Band]]\" on the piano during a Broadway rehearsal of the 1930 production of ''Strike Up the Band''. In the mid-30s, \"Strike Up The Band\" was given to UCLA to be used as a football fight song, \"Strike Up The Band for UCLA\". The comedy team of [[Clark and McCullough]] are seen conversing with Gershwin, then singing as he plays.\n[[File:George_Gershwin_USPS_stamp_1973.jpg|thumb|1973 U.S. commemorative stamp honoring Gershwin]]\nIn 1945, the film biography ''[[Rhapsody in Blue (film)|Rhapsody in Blue]]'' was made, starring [[Robert Alda]] as George Gershwin. The film contains many factual errors about Gershwin's life, but also features many examples of his music, including an almost complete performance of ''Rhapsody in Blue''.\n\nIn 1965, [[Movietone Records]] released an album MTM 1009 featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of the titled ''George Gershwin plays RHAPSODY IN BLUE and his other favorite compositions''. The B-side of the LP featured nine other recordings.\n\nIn 1975, [[Columbia Records]] released an album featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of ''Rhapsody In Blue'', accompanied by the Columbia Jazz Band playing the original jazz band accompaniment, conducted by [[Michael Tilson Thomas]]. The B-side of the [[Columbia Masterworks]] release features Tilson Thomas leading the [[New York Philharmonic]] in ''An American In Paris.''\n\nIn 1976, RCA Records, as part of its \"Victrola Americana\" line, released a collection of Gershwin recordings taken from 78s recorded in the 1920s and called the LP \"Gershwin plays Gershwin, Historic First Recordings\" (RCA Victrola AVM1-1740).  Included were recordings of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and Gershwin on piano; \"An American in Paris\", from 1927 with Gershwin on celesta; and \"Three Preludes\", \"Clap Yo' Hands\" and Someone to Watch Over Me\", among others. There are a total of ten recordings on the album. At the opening ceremony of the 1984 [[Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles, \"Rhapsody in Blue\" was performed in spectacular fashion by many pianists.\n\nThe soundtrack to [[Woody Allen]]'s 1979 film [[Manhattan (film)|''Manhattan'']] is composed entirely of Gershwin's compositions, including ''Rhapsody in Blue'', \"[[Love is Sweeping the Country]]\", and [[But Not for Me (song)|\"But Not for Me\"]], performed by both the New York Philharmonic under [[Zubin Mehta]] and the Buffalo Philharmonic under [[Michael Tilson Thomas]]. The film begins with a monologue by Allen: \"He adored New York City ...

The [[parts of speech]] affected by gender agreement, the circumstances in which it occurs, and the way words are marked for gender vary between languages. Gender inflection may interact with other grammatical categories like [[grammatical number|number]] or [[grammatical case|case]]. In some languages the [[declension]] pattern followed by the noun itself will be different for different genders.\n\nGrammatical gender is found in many [[Indo-European languages]] (including [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[German language|German]] \u2014 but not [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[English language|English]], for example), [[Afroasiatic languages]] (which includes the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Berber languages]], etc.), and in other [[language families]] such as [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] and [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]], as well as several [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] such as [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], and [[Kala Lagaw Ya language|Kalaw Lagaw Ya]]. Most [[Niger\u2013Congo languages]] also have extensive systems of noun classes, which can be grouped into several grammatical genders. Conversely, grammatical gender is usually absent from the [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]], [[Japonic languages|Japonic]], [[Tungusic language|Tungusic]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and most [[Native American languages|Native American]] language families.{{sfn|Corbett|1991|p=2}} [[Modern English]] makes use of gender in pronouns, which are generally marked for natural gender, but lacks a system of gender concord within the [[noun phrase]] which is one of the central elements of grammatical gender in most other Indo-European languages.<ref name=\"audring\">{{Cite journal |last=Audring|first=Jenny |date=2008-10-01 |title=Gender assignment and gender agreement: Evidence from pronominal gender languages |url=https://www.academia.edu/3321785/Gender_assignment_and_gender_agreement_Evidence_from_pronominal_gender_languages |journal=Morphology |language=en |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=93\u2013116 |doi=10.1007/s11525-009-9124-y |issn=1871-5621 |via=Academia.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Gato vs gata, illustration of grammatical gender in Spanish.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The grammatical gender of a noun affects the form of other words related to it.

Most such languages usually have from two to four different genders, but some are attested with up to 20.<ref name=\"hockett\"/><ref name=\"dixon\">{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Robert|title=Noun Classes|year=1968|publisher=Lingua|pages=105\u2013111}}</ref><ref name=\"sil\">[http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsGrammaticalGender.htm SIL: Glossary of Linguistic Terms: What is grammatical gender?]</ref>\n\nThe division into genders usually correlates to some degree, at least for a certain set of nouns (such as those denoting humans), with some property or properties of the things that particular nouns denote. Such properties include [[animacy]] or inanimacy, \"[[human]]ness\" or non-humanness, and biological [[sex]].\n\nFew or no nouns can occur in more than one class.<ref name=\"hockett\"/><ref name=\"dixon\"/><ref name=\"sil\"/> Depending on the language and the word, this assignment might bear some relationship with the meaning of the noun (e.g. \"woman\" is usually feminine), or may be arbitrary.{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=72}}{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=78}}\n\nGender is considered an inherent quality of nouns, and it affects the forms of other related words, a process called [[agreement (linguistics)|\u201cagreement\u201d]]. Nouns may be considered the \u201ctriggers\u201d of the process, whereas other words will be the \u201ctarget\u201d of these changes.{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=72}}\n\nThese related words can be, depending on the language: [[determiner]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s, [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s, [[possessive]]s, [[adjective]]s, past and passive [[participle]]s, [[article (grammar)|article]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adverbs]], [[complementizer]]s, and [[adposition]]s. Gender class may be marked on the noun itself, but will also always be marked on other constituents in a noun phrase or sentence. If the noun is explicitly marked, both trigger and target may feature similar alternations.<ref name=\"dixon\"/>{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=72}}{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=78}}\n\nCommon systems of gender division include:{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n* '''masculine\u2013feminine''': Here nouns that denote specifically male persons (or animals) are normally of masculine gender; those that denote specifically female persons (or animals) are normally of feminine gender; and nouns that denote something that does not have any sex, or do not specify the sex of their referent, have come to belong to one or other of the genders, in a way that may appear arbitrary.{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=72}}{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=78}} Examples of languages with such a system include most of the modern [[Romance languages]], the [[Baltic languages]], the [[Celtic languages]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], and the [[Afroasiatic languages]].\n* '''masculine\u2013feminine\u2013neuter''': This is similar to the masculine\u2013feminine system, except that there is a third available gender, so nouns with sexless or unspecified-sex referents may be either masculine, feminine, or neuter. There are also certain exceptional nouns whose gender does not follow the denoted sex, such as the German ''M\u00e4dchen'', meaning \"girl\", which is neuter. This is because it is actually a diminutive of \"Magd\" and all diminutive forms with the suffix ''-chen'' are neuter.  Examples of languages with such a system include later forms of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (see [[#Indo-European|below]]), [[Sanskrit]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] in most dialects and in both written forms ([[Bokm\u00e5l]] and [[Nynorsk]]), [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Modern Greek grammar|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[German language|German]], standard [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and some dialects<ref>[https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/mannelijk-vrouwelijk-woord]</ref><ref>http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/tekst/101/woordgeslacht_algemeen/</ref><ref>[http://www.taaltelefoon.be/mannelijk-vrouwelijk-onzijdig]</ref> and the [[Slavic languages]].\n* '''animate\u2013inanimate''': Here nouns that denote animate things (humans and animals) generally belong to one gender, and those that denote inanimate things to another (although there may be some deviation from that principle). Examples include earlier forms of Proto-Indo-European and the earliest family known to have split off from it, the extinct [[Anatolian languages]] (see [[#Indo-European|below]]). Modern examples include, to some extent, [[Basque grammar|Basque]], and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]].{{sfn|Corbett|1991|pp=20\u201321}}\nIn Northern [[Kurdish language]] ([[Kurmanji]]), the same word can have two genders according to the context. For example, if the word ''dar'' (meaning wood or tree) is feminine, it means that it is a living tree (e.g. ''dara s\u00eav\u00ea'' means \"apple tree\"), but if it is masculine, it means that it is dead, no longer living (e.g. ''dar\u00ea s\u00eav\u00ea'' means \"apple wood\"). So if one wants to say a certain table is made of the wood from an apple tree, he or she can not use the word ''dar'' in a feminine gender, and if he or she wants to refer to the apple tree in his or her garden can not use ''dar'' with masculine gender. \n* '''common\u2013neuter''': Here a masculine\u2013feminine\u2013neuter system previously existed, but the distinction between masculine and feminine genders has been lost (they have merged into what is called ''common gender''). Thus nouns denoting people are usually of common gender, whereas other nouns may be of either gender. Examples include [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (see [[Gender in Danish and Swedish]]), and to some extent Dutch (see [[Gender in Dutch grammar]]). The dialect of the old Norwegian capital [[Bergen]] also uses common gender and neuter exclusively. The common gender in Bergen and in Danish is inflected with the same articles and suffixes as the masculine gender in [[Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l]]. This makes some obviously feminine noun phrases like \"a cute girl\", \"the well milking cow\" or \"the pregnant mares\" sound strange to most Norwegian ears when spoken by Danes and people from Bergen since they are inflected in a way that sounds like the masculine declensions in South-Eastern Norwegian dialects. The same does not apply to [[Swedish language|Swedish]] common gender, as the declensions follow a different pattern than both the Norwegian written languages. [[Norwegian Nynorsk]], [[Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l]] and most spoken dialects retain masculine, feminine and neuter even if their Scandinavian neighbours have lost one of the genders. As shown, the merger of masculine and feminine in these languages and dialects can be considered a reversal of the original split in Proto-Indo-European (see [[#Indo-European|below]]).\n\nOther types of division or subdivision may be found in particular languages. These may sometimes be referred to as ''classes'' rather than genders; for some examples, see [[Noun class]]. In some of the [[Slavic languages]], for example, within the masculine and sometimes feminine and neuter genders, there is a further division between animate and inanimate nouns \u2013 and in [[Polish grammar|Polish]], also sometimes between nouns denoting humans and non-humans. (For details, see [[#Slavic languages|below]].) A human\u2013non-human (or \"rational\u2013non-rational\") distinction is also found in [[Dravidian languages]]. (See [[#Dravidian|below]].)\n\n==Consequences of gender==\nThe grammatical gender of a noun manifests itself in two principal ways: in the modifications that the noun itself undergoes, and in modifications of other related words ([[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]). These are described in the following sections.\n\n===Noun inflection===\nThe gender of a noun may affect the modifications that the noun itself undergoes, particularly the way in which the noun [[inflection|inflects]] for [[grammatical number|number]] and [[grammatical case|case]]. For example, a language like [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] or [[Russian language|Russian]] has a number of different declension patterns, and which pattern a particular noun follows may be highly correlated with its gender. For some instances of this, see [[Latin declension]]. A concrete example is provided by the German word ''See'', which has two possible genders: when it is masculine (meaning \"lake\") its [[genitive]] singular form is ''Sees'', but when it is feminine (meaning \"sea\"), the genitive is ''See'', because feminine nouns do not take the genitive ''-s''.\n\nGender is sometimes reflected in other ways. In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], gender marking is mostly lost on nouns; however, Welsh has [[consonant mutation#Celtic languages|initial mutation]], where the first consonant of a word changes into another in certain conditions. Gender is one of the factors that can cause one form of mutation (soft mutation). For instance, the word ''merch'' \"girl\" changes into ''ferch'' after the [[definite article]]. This only occurs with feminine singular nouns: ''mab'' \"son\" remains unchanged. Adjectives are affected by gender in a similar way.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/learnwelsh/pdf/welshgrammar_mutations.pdf | title=Y Treigladau \u2013 The Mutations | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=Learn Welsh | year=2002 | accessdate=15 March 2014 | pages=1\u20132 | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"2\"\n|-\n! align=left |\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Default\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | After definite article\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | With adjective\n|-\n!

Feminine singular\n| ''merch'' || \"girl\" || ''y '''f'''erch'' || \"the girl\" || ''y '''f'''erch '''f'''awr'' ||\"the big girl\"\n|}\n\nAdditionally, in many languages, gender is often closely correlated with the basic unmodified form ([[lemma (morphology)|lemma]]) of the noun, and sometimes a noun can be modified to produce (for example) masculine and feminine words of similar meaning. See {{slink||Correlation between gender and the form of a noun}}, below.\n\n===Agreement===\n[[Agreement (linguistics)|Agreement]], or concord, is a grammatical process in which certain words change their form so that values of certain [[grammatical category|grammatical categories]] match those of related words. Gender is one of the categories which frequently require agreement. In this case, nouns may be considered the \u201ctriggers\u201d of the process, because they have an inherent gender, whereas related words that change their form to match the gender of the noun can be considered the \u201ctarget\u201d of these changes.{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=72}}\n\nThese related words can be, depending on the language: [[determiner]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s, [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s, [[possessive]]s, [[adjective]]s, past and passive [[participle]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adverbs]], [[complementizer]]s, and [[adposition]]s. Gender class may be marked on the noun itself, but can also be marked on other constituents in a noun phrase or sentence. If the noun is explicitly marked, both trigger and target may feature similar alternations.<ref name=\"dixon\"/>{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=72}}{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=78}}\n\nAs an example, we consider [[Spanish language|Spanish]], a language with two noun genders: masculine and feminine.{{sfn|Bradley|2004|p=18}} Among other lexical items, the [[definite article]] changes its form according to the gender of the noun. In the singular, the article is: ''el'' (masculine),<ref>Exception: Feminine nouns beginning with stressed ''a-'', like ''\u00e1guila'' \"eagle\", also take the article ''el'' despite their feminine gender (''el \u00e1guila'' \"the eagle\"). This does not happen if the noun is preceded by an adjective (''la bella \u00e1guila'' \"the beautiful eagle\"), or in the plural (''las aguilas'' \"the eagles\").</ref> and ''la'' (feminine).{{sfn|Bradley|2004|p=27}} Thus, nouns referring to male beings carry the masculine article, and female beings the feminine article (agreement).<ref>These examples are based on an example in French from {{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage |year=1994 |publisher=Merriam-Webster Inc |isbn=0-87779-132-5 |page=474}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Example{{sfn|Bradley|2004|p=18}}\n|-\n!

The noun ''actor'' changes by replacing the masculine suffix ''-or'' with the feminine suffix ''-riz'', the personal pronoun ''\u00e9l'' \"he\" changes to ''ella'' \"she\", and the feminine suffix ''-a'' is added to the article (''un'' \u2192 ''una'') and to the adjective (''buen'' \u2192 ''buena'').\n\nWhen a verb is used as a noun, it is almost always masculine.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because this noun was grammatically feminine, the adjectives ''brade'' \"broad\" and ''tilu'' \"good\", as well as the pronouns ''seo'' \"the/that\" and ''hire'' \"her\", which referred to ''lind'', must also appear in their feminine forms. Old English had three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, but gender inflections (like many other types of inflection in English) were later greatly simplified by [[sound change]]s, and then completely lost.\n\nIn modern English, by contrast, the noun ''shield'' takes the neuter pronoun ''it'', because it designates a sexless object. In a sense, the neuter gender has grown to encompass most nouns, including many that were masculine or feminine in Old English. If one were to replace the phrase \"broad shield\" above with ''brave man'' or ''brave woman'', the only change to the rest of the sentence would be in the pronoun at the end, which would become ''him'' or ''her'' respectively.\n\n==Gender assignment==\n[[File:French country name genders.svg|upright=1.6|thumb|In the French language, countries can have masculine (green) or feminine (purple) names. Except for certain islands and ''Mexique'', ''Mozambique'', ''Cambodge'' and ''Zimbabwe'', the gender depends on whether the country name ends in ''-e''.]]\n[[File:Polish country name genders.svg|upright=1.6|thumb|In the Polish language, countries can have masculine (blue), feminine (red) or neuter (yellow) names. Countries with plural names are green.]]\n[[File:Gender in European languages.png|thumb|Gender in European languages.\nLight blue: no gender system.\n\nYellow: common/neuter.\n\nGreen: animate/inanimate ([[Basque language|Basque]]).\n\nRed: masculine/feminine.\n\nDark blue: masculine/feminine/neuter.  Standard Dutch has a three-gender structure, which fell in disuse in the North of the Netherlands but remains very much alive in Flanders and the South of the Netherlands.\n]]\nThere are three main ways by which natural languages categorize nouns into genders: according to logical or symbolic similarities in their meaning ([[semantics|semantic]]), by grouping them with other nouns that have similar form ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]]), and through apparently arbitrary convention (lexical, possibly rooted in the language's history). In most languages that have grammatical gender, a combination of these three types of criteria is found, although one type may be more prevalent.\n\n===Strict semantic criteria===\nIn some languages, the gender of a noun is directly determined by its physical attributes (sex, animacy, etc.), and there are few or no exceptions to this rule. There are relatively few such languages. The [[Dravidian languages]] use this system as described [[#Dravidian|below]].\n\nAnother example is the [[Dizi language]], which has two asymmetrical genders. The feminine includes all living beings of female sex (e.g. woman, girl, cow...), and [[diminutive]]s; the masculine encompasses all other nouns (e.g. man, boy, pot, broom...). In this language, feminine nouns are always marked with ''-e'' or ''-in''.{{sfn|Corbett|1991|p=11}}\n\nAnother African language, [[Defaka language|Defaka]], has three genders: one for all male humans, one for all female humans, and a third for all the remaining nouns. Gender is only marked in personal pronouns. Standard English pronouns (see [[#English|below]]) are very similar in this respect, although the English gendered pronouns (''he'', ''she'') are used for domestic animals if the sex of the animal is known, and sometimes for certain objects such as ships,{{sfn|Corbett|1991|p=12}} e.g. \"What happened to the Titanic? She (or it) sank.\"\n\n===Mostly semantic criteria===\nIn some other languages, the gender of nouns can again mostly be determined by physical (semantic) attributes, although there remain some nouns whose gender is not assigned in this way (Corbett calls this \"semantic residue\").{{sfn|Corbett|1991|p=13}} The world view (e.g. mythology) of the speakers may influence the division of categories.{{sfn|Corbett|1991|p=32}}\n\nAn example is the [[Zande language]], which has four genders: male human, female human, animal, and inanimate.{{sfn|Corbett|1991|p=14}} However, there are about 80 nouns representing inanimate entities which are nonetheless animate in gender: heavenly objects (moon, rainbow), metal objects (hammer, ring), edible plants (sweet potato, pea), and non-metallic objects (whistle, ball). Many have a round shape or can be explained by the role they play in mythology.{{sfn|Corbett|1991|p=14}}\n\nThe [[Ket language]] has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and most gender assignment is based on semantics, but there are many inanimate nouns outside the neuter class. Masculine nouns include male animates, most fish, trees, the moon, large wooden objects, most living beings and some religious items. Feminine nouns include female animates, three types of fish, some plants, the sun and other heavenly objects, some body parts and skin diseases, the soul, and some religious items. Words for part of a whole, as well as most other nouns that do not fall into any of the aforementioned classes, are neuter. The gender assignment of non-sex-differentiable things is complex. In general, those of no importance to the Kets are feminine, whereas objects of importance (e.g. fish, wood) are masculine. Mythology is again a significant factor.{{sfn|Corbett|1991|p=19}}\n\nThe [[Alamblak language]] has two genders, masculine and feminine. However, the masculine also includes things which are tall or long and slender, or narrow (e.g. fish, snakes, arrows and slender trees), whereas the feminine gender has things which are short, squat or wide (e.g. turtles, houses, shields and squat trees).{{sfn|Corbett|1991|p=32}}\n\nThe distinction between the gender of a noun and the gender of the object it refers to is clear when nouns of different genders can be used for the same object, e.g. French v\u00e9lo (m.) = bicyclette (f.).\n\n===Correlation between gender and the form of a noun===\nIn many other languages, nouns are assigned to gender largely without any semantic basis \u2013 that is, not based on any feature (such as animacy or sex) of the person or thing that a noun represents. However, in many languages there may be a correlation, to a greater or lesser degree, between gender and the form of a noun (such as the letter or syllable with which it ends).\n\nFor example, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], nouns that end in ''-o'' or a consonant are mostly masculine, whereas those that end in ''-a'' are mostly feminine, regardless of their meaning. (Nouns that end in some other vowel are assigned a gender either according to [[etymology]], by analogy, or by some other convention.) These rules may override semantics in some cases: for example, the noun ''membro''/''miembro'' (\"member\") is always masculine, even when it refers to a girl or a woman, and ''pessoa''/''persona'' (\"person\") is always feminine, even when it refers to a boy or a man. (In other cases, though, meaning takes precedence: the noun ''comunista'' \"communist\" is masculine when it refers or could refer to a man, even though it ends with ''-a''.) In fact, nouns in Spanish and Portuguese (as in the other [[Romance languages]] such as Italian and French) generally follow the gender of the Latin words from which they are derived. When nouns deviate from the rules for gender, there is usually an etymological explanation: ''problema'' (\"problem\") is masculine in Spanish because it was derived from a Greek noun of the neuter gender, whereas ''foto'' (\"photo\") and ''radio'' (\"broadcast signal\") are feminine because they are [[Clipping (morphology)|clippings]] of ''fotograf\u00eda'' and ''radiodifusi\u00f3n'' respectively, both grammatically feminine nouns. (Most Spanish nouns in ''-i\u00f3n'' are feminine; they derive from Latin feminines in ''-\u014d'', accusative ''-i\u014dnem''.) But the opposite is correct with Northern [[Kurdish language]] or [[Kurmanci]]. For example, the words endam (member) and heval (friend) can be masculine or feminine according to the person they refer to.\n*Ke\u00e7a w\u00ee hevala min e. (His daughter is my friend)\n*Kurr\u00ea w\u00ee heval\u00ea min e. (His son is my friend)\n\n[[Suffix]]es often carry a specific gender. For example, in [[German language|German]], [[diminutive]]s with the suffixes ''-chen'' and ''-lein'' (meaning \"little, young\") are always neuter, even if they refer to people, as with ''M\u00e4dchen'' (\"girl\") and ''Fr\u00e4ulein'' (\"young woman\") (see [[#Natural gender|below]]). Similarly, the suffix ''-ling'', which makes [[count noun|countable nouns]] from uncountable nouns (''Teig'' \"dough\" \u2192 ''Teigling'' \"piece of dough\"), or personal nouns from abstract nouns (''Lehre'' \"teaching\", ''Strafe'' \"punishment\" \u2192 ''Lehrling'' \"apprentice\", ''Str\u00e4fling'' \"convict\") or adjectives (''feige'' \"cowardly\" \u2192 ''Feigling'' \"coward\"), always produces masculine nouns. And the German suffixes ''-heit'' and ''-keit'' (comparable with ''-hood'' and ''-ness'' in English) produce feminine nouns.\n\nIn [[Irish language|Irish]], nouns ending in ''-\u00f3ir/-eoir'' and ''-\u00edn'' are always masculine, whereas those ending ''-\u00f3g/-eog'' or ''-lann'' are always feminine.\n\nIn [[Arabic language|Arabic]], nouns whose singular form ends in a ''[[t\u0101\u02be marb\u016b\u1e6dah]]'' (traditionally a {{IPAblink|t}}, becoming {{IPAblink|h}} in [[pausa]]) are of feminine gender, the only significant exceptions being the word {{lang|ar|\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0629}} ''{{transl|ar|khal\u012bfah}}'' (\"[[caliph]]\") and certain masculine personal names (e.g. {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0645\u0629}} [[Osama (name)|\u02beUs\u0101mah]]). However, many masculine nouns take a ''t\u0101\u02be marb\u016b\u1e6da'' in their plural; for example {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0630}} ''{{transl|ar|ust\u0101dh}}'' (\"male professor\") has the plural {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0633\u0627\u062a\u0630\u0629}} ''{{transl|ar|as\u0101tidha}}'', which might be confused for a feminine singular noun. Gender may also be predictable from the type of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]]: for instance, the [[Arabic verbal noun|verbal nouns]] of Stem II (e.g. {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0639\u064a\u0644}} ''{{transl|ar|al-taf\u02bf\u012bl}}'', from {{lang|ar|\u0641\u0639\u0651\u0644\u060c \u064a\u0641\u0639\u0651\u0644}}  ''{{transl|ar|fa\u02bf\u02bfala, yufa\u02bf\u02bfil}}'') are always masculine.\n\nIn [[French language|French]], nouns ending in ''-e'' tend to be feminine, whereas others tend to be masculine, but there are many exceptions to this (e.g. ''cadre'', ''arbre'', ''signe'', ''meuble'', ''nuage'' are masculine as ''fa\u00e7on'', ''chanson'', ''voix'', ''main'', ''eau'' are feminine), note the many masculine nouns ending in ''-e'' preceded by double consonants. Certain suffixes are quite reliable indicators, such as ''-age'', which when added to a verb (e.g. ''garer'' \"to park\" \u2192 ''garage''; nettoyer \"to clean\" \u2192 ''nettoyage'' \"cleaning\") indicates a masculine noun; however, when -''age'' is part of the root of the word, it can be feminine, as in ''plage'' (\"beach\") or ''image''. On the other hand, nouns ending in ''-tion'', ''-sion'' and ''-aison'' are all feminine.\n\nNouns can sometimes vary their form to enable the [[Morphological derivation|derivation]] of differently gendered [[cognate (linguistics)|cognate]] nouns; for example, to produce nouns with a similar meaning but referring to someone of a different sex. Thus, in Spanish, ''ni\u00f1o'' means \"boy\", and ''ni\u00f1a'' means \"girl\". This paradigm can be exploited for making new words: from the masculine nouns ''abogado'' \"lawyer\", ''diputado'' \"member of parliament\" and ''doctor'' \"doctor\", it was straightforward to make the feminine equivalents ''abogada'', ''diputada'', and ''doctora''.\n\nIn the same way, [[personal name]]s are frequently constructed with affixes that identify the sex of the bearer. Common feminine suffixes used in English names are ''-a'', of [[Latin language|Latin]] or [[Romance languages|Romance]] origin (cf. ''Robert'' and ''Roberta''); and ''-e'', of [[French language|French]] origin (cf. ''Justin'' and ''Justine'').\n\nAlthough gender inflection may be used to construct nouns and names for people of opposite sexes in languages that have grammatical gender, this alone does not constitute grammatical gender. Distinct words and names for men and women are also common in languages which do not have a grammatical gender system for nouns in general. English, for example, has feminine suffixes such as ''-ess'' (as in ''actress'', ''waitress'', etc.), and also distinguishes male and female personal names, as in the above examples.\n\n====Gender in personal names====\n[[File:Spanish names&nouns ending in a Statistics.png|thumb|right|Statistical data on the Spanish nouns and names ending in a]]\n\nGiven names are proper nouns and they follow the same gender grammatical rules as common nouns. In most Indo-European languages female grammatical gender is created using an \u201ca\u201d or an \u201ce\u201d ending.\n\nClassical Latin typically made a grammatical feminine gender in \u201ca\u201d (silva - forest, aqua - water) and this was reflected in feminine names originating in that period, like Emilia. Romance languages preserved this characteristic. For example, Spanish has approximately 89% feminine nouns with an \u201ca\u201d ending and 98% given names with the same ending.<ref>[http://blog-en.namepedia.org/2015/12/names-under-the-dome-a-peek-into-samoan-culture/ NamepediA Blog - Why Most European Names Ending in A Are Female], ''article that theorizes why most of the European female names end in a''</ref>\n\nIn the Germanic languages the female names have been Latinized by adding \u201ce\u201d and \u201ca\u201d: Brunhild, Kriemhild and Hroswith became Brunhilde, Kriemhilde and Hroswitha.\nSlavic feminine given names: Olga (Russian), Ma\u0142gorzata (Polish), Tetiana (Ukrainian), Oksana (Belarusian), Eli\u0161ka (Czech), Bronislava (Slovak), Milica (Serbian), Darina (Bulgarian), Lucja (Croatian), Lamija (Bosnian) and Zala (Slovenian).\n\n===Apparent absence of criteria===\nIn some languages, any gender markers have been so eroded over time (possibly through [[Deflexion (linguistics)|deflexion]]) that they are no longer recognizable. Many German nouns, for example, do not indicate their gender through either meaning or form. In such cases a noun's gender must simply be memorized, and gender can be regarded as an integral part of each noun when considered as an entry in the speaker's [[lexicon]]. (This is reflected in [[dictionary|dictionaries]], which typically indicate the gender of noun [[headword]]s where applicable.)\n\n[[Second-language learner]]s are often encouraged to memorize a modifier, usually a [[definite article]], in conjunction with each noun \u2013 for example, a learner of French may learn the word for \"chair\" as ''la chaise'' (meaning \"the chair\"); this carries the information that the noun is ''chaise'', and that it is feminine (because ''la'' is the feminine singular form of the definite article).\n\nWhen learning a second language such as Spanish speakers are encouraged to memorize articles (either the \"el\" or the \"la\" in front of the word. Generally they correspond with \"-o\" being masculine and \"-a\" being feminine. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Examples of some words that are considered exceptions would be ''el panda'' (the panda), ''el d\u00eda'' (the day), ''la mano'' (the hand), ''el cura'' (the priest), etc.\n\n==Nouns with more than one gender==\nIt is relatively uncommon for a noun to have more than one possible gender.<ref name=\"hockett\"/><ref name=\"dixon\"/><ref name=\"sil\"/> When this happens, it may be associated with a difference in the sex of the referent, as with nouns such as ''comunista'' in Spanish, which may be either masculine or feminine, depending on whether it refers to a male or a female.  It may also correspond to some other difference in the meaning of the word. For example, the German word ''See'' meaning \"lake\" is masculine, whereas the identical word meaning \"sea\" is feminine.  The meanings of the Norwegian noun ''ting'' have diverged further: masculine ''en ting'' is \"a thing\", whereas neuter ''et ting'' is \"an assembly\". (The parliament is the Storting, \"the Great ''Ting''\"; the other ''ting''s like Borgarting are the regional courts.)  \n\nIt is a matter of analysis how to draw the line between a single [[polysemy|polysemous]] word with multiple genders and a set of [[homonym]]s with one gender each. For example, Bulgarian has a pair of homonyms ''\u043f\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442'' (''pr\u0259st'') which are etymologically unrelated. One is masculine and means \"finger\"; the other is feminine and means \"soil\".\n\nSometimes a noun's gender can change between plural and singular, as with the French words ''amour'' (\"love\"), ''d\u00e9lice'' (\"delight\") and ''orgue'' (\"organ\" as musical instrument), all of which are masculine in the singular but feminine in the plural. These anomalies may have a historical explanation (''amour'' used to be feminine in the singular too) or result from slightly different notions (''orgue'' in the singular is usually a [[barrel organ]], whereas the plural ''orgues'' usually refers to the collection of columns in a [[church organ]]){{disputed inline|reason=\"It's actually a remnant of the neutral declension in Latin\"|date=December 2013}}. Further examples are the Italian words ''uovo'' (\"egg\") and ''braccio'' (\"arm\"). These are masculine in the singular, but form the irregular plurals ''uova'' and ''braccia'', which have the endings of the feminine singular, but have feminine plural agreement. (This is related to the forms of the [[Latin declension|second declension]] Latin neuter nouns from which they derive: ''ovum'' and ''bracchium'', with nominative plurals ''ova'' and ''bracchia''.)\n\nIn other cases, a word may be usable in multiple genders indifferently.  For example, in Bulgarian the word ''\u043f\u0443&#x300;\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0448'', (''pustosh'', \"wilderness\") may be either masculine (definite form ''\u043f\u0443&#x00300;\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0448\u0430'', ''pustosh\u0259'') or feminine (definite form ''\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0448\u0442\u0430&#x300;'', ''pustoshta'') without any change in meaning and no preference in usage.\nIn Norwegian, many nouns can be either feminine or masculine according to the dialect, level of formality or whim of the speaker/writer. Even the two written forms of the language have many nouns whose gender is optional. Choosing the masculine gender will often seem more formal than using the feminine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} This might be because before the creation of [[Norwegian Nynorsk]] and [[Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l]] in the late 19th century, Norwegians wrote Danish, which has lost the feminine gender, thus making use of the masculine gender (corresponding exactly to Danish common gender in conjugation in Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l) is more formal sounding to modern Norwegians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe noun \"sun\" can be another example. You might decline it masculine: \"En sol, solen, soler, solene\" or feminine \"Ei sol, sola, soler, solene\" in [[Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l]]. The same goes for a lot of common words like \"bok\" (book), \"dukke\" (doll), \"b\u00f8tte\" (bucket) and so forth. Many of the words where it is possible to choose gender are inanimate objects that one might suspect would be conjugated with the neuter gender. Nouns conjugated with the neuter gender can normally not be conjugated as feminine or masculine in Norwegian. There is also a slight tendency towards using the masculine indefinite article even when choosing the feminine conjugation of a noun in many eastern Norwegian dialects. For instance, girl: \"En jente - jenta - jenter - jentene\".\n\n==Genderless nouns==\nIn some languages the gender is distinguished only in singular number but not in plural. In terms of linguistic [[markedness]], these languages neutralize the gender opposition in the plural, itself a marked category. So adjectives and pronouns have three forms in singular (e.g. Bulgarian ''\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d'', ''\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430'', ''\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e'' or German ''roter'', ''rote'', ''rotes'') but only one in plural (Bulgarian ''\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438'', German ''rote'') [all examples mean \"red\"]. As a consequence ''[[pluralia tantum]]'' nouns (lacking a singular form) cannot be assigned a gender. Example with Bulgarian: ''\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0449\u0438'' (''kleshti'', \"pincers\"), ''\u0433\u0430\u0449\u0438'' (''gashti'', \"pants\"), ''\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430'' (''ochila'', \"spectacles\"), ''\u0445\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0435'' (''hrile'', \"gills\"). The characteristic ending ''-\u0430'' of ''\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043b'''\u0430''''' suggests a neuter noun, but there is no way to cross-check it and there are indeed a few masculine nouns using the same ending in their plural (''\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043a'''\u0430''''' and ''\u0440\u043e\u0433'''\u0430''''' are plurals of masculine ''\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043a'' \"leg\" and ''\u0440\u043e\u0433'' \"horn\"). However, the endings ''-\u0438'' and ''-\u0435'' do not make any such indications because they are ambiguous themselves: although ''-\u0438'' is the regular ending for masculine and feminine nouns, both are in fact used to form plurals of nouns of all three genders (e.g. ''\u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434'''\u0438''''', ''\u0436\u0435\u043d'''\u0438''''', ''\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c'''\u0438''''' from masculine ''\u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434'' \"factory\", feminine ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'' \"woman\" and neuter ''\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043e'' \"insect\" or ''\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043b'''\u0435''''', ''\u0440\u044a\u0446'''\u0435''''', ''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d'''\u0435''''' from masculine ''\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043b'' \"king\", feminine ''\u0440\u044a\u043a\u0430'' \"hand\" and neuter ''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043d\u043e'' \"knee\").\n\nOther languages, e.g. [[Serbo-Croatian]], allow doubly marked forms both for number and gender. In these languages, each noun has a definite gender no matter the number. For example, ''djeca'' \"children\" is feminine ''[[singularia tantum]]'' and ''vrata'' \"door\" is neuter ''pluralia tantum''.\n\n==Names, occupations, and nationalities==\nIn some languages, some names have two forms, a male and a female one. This can be true of occupations and nationalities. For example, ''Andrew'' and ''Andrea'' in English, or ''\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (Konstantinos)'' and ''\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03b1 (Konstantina)'' in Greek. Or ''actor'' and ''actress'' in English, but ''doctor'' for both, and ''\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 (ithopios)'' \u201cactor\u201d for both male and female in Greek and ''\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (giatros)'' \u201cdoctor\u201d again for both, but with informal female variants ''\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b1 (giatrina)'' and ''\u03b3\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 (giatraina)'' too. Finally, in the case of a nationality, in Greek there are five forms: male and female for people (and sometimes for other living beings), and masculine, feminine, and neuter for nouns. For example, ''English = \u0386\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (Agglos), \u0391\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 (Agglida), \u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (agglikos), \u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae (aggliki), \u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc (aggliko)''. To complicate matters, the Greek language often offers additional less formal versions of these. The corresponding for English are the following: ''\u0395\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03ad\u03b6\u03bf\u03c2 (Egglezos), \u0395\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03ad\u03b6\u03b1 (Eggleza), \u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03ad\u03b6\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (egglezikos), \u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03ad\u03b6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 (eggleziki), \u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03ad\u03b6\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf (eggleziko)''. The formal forms come from the name ''\u0391\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 (Agglia)'' \u201cEngland\u201d, while the less formal are derived from Italian ''inglese''.\n\n==Related linguistic concepts==\n\n===Noun classes===\n{{Main|Noun classes}}\nA noun may belong to a given class because of characteristic features of its [[referent]], such as sex, animacy, shape, although in some instances a noun can be placed in a particular class based purely on its grammatical behavior. Some authors use the term \"grammatical gender\" as a synonym of \"noun class\", but others use different definitions for each.\n\nMany authors prefer \"noun classes\" when none of the inflections in a language relate to sex, such as when an [[animacy|animate]]\u2013inanimate distinction is made. Note however that the word \"gender\" derives from Latin ''[[genus]]'' (also the root of ''genre'') which originally meant \"kind\", so it does not necessarily have a sexual meaning.\n\n===Noun classifiers===\n{{Main|Noun classifier}}\nA classifier, or [[measure word]], is a [[word]] or [[morpheme]] used in some languages together with a noun, principally to enable numbers and certain other [[determiner]]s to be applied to the noun. They are not regularly used in English or other European languages, although they parallel the use of words such as ''piece(s)'' and ''head'' in phrases like \"three pieces of paper\" or \"thirty head of cattle\". They are a prominent feature of [[East Asian languages]], where it is common for all nouns to require a classifier when being quantified \u2013 for example, the equivalent of \"three people\" is often \"three ''classifier'' people\". A more general type of classifier ([[classifier handshape]]s) can be found in [[sign language]]s.\n\nClassifiers can be considered similar to genders or noun classes, in that a language which uses classifiers normally has a number of different ones, used with different sets of nouns. These sets depend largely on properties of the things that the nouns denote (for example, a particular classifier may be used for long thin objects, another for flat objects, another for people, another for abstracts, etc.), although sometimes a noun is associated with a particular classifier more by convention than for any obvious reason. However it is also possible for a given noun to be usable with any of several classifiers; for example, the Mandarin [[Chinese classifier]] \u4e2a ''g\u00e8'' is frequently used as an alternative to various more specific classifiers.\n\n==Gender of pronouns==\n[[File:Gender in Pronouns.png|thumb|Gender in Pronouns]]\nAs noted above, pronouns may [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in gender with the noun or noun phrase to which they refer (their [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]). Sometimes, however, there is no antecedent \u2013 the referent of the pronoun is deduced indirectly from the context. In such cases, the pronoun is likely to agree with the ''natural gender'' of the referent. Examples of this can be in most European languages, including English (the [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]] ''he'', ''she'' and ''it'' are used depending on whether the referent is male, female, or inanimate or non-human; this is in spite of the fact that English does not generally have grammatical gender). A parallel example is provided by the object suffixes of verbs in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]], which correspond to object pronouns, and which also inflect for gender in the [[grammatical person|second person]] (though not in the first):\n* \"I love you\", said to a male: ''{{transl|ar|u\u1e25ibbuk'''a'''}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u064f\u062d\u0650\u0628\u064f\u0651\u0643\u064e}})\n* \"I love you\", said to a female: ''{{transl|ar|u\u1e25ibbuk'''i'''}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u064f\u062d\u0650\u0628\u064f\u0651\u0643\u0650}})\n\nNot all languages have gendered pronouns. In languages that never had grammatical gender, there is normally just one word for \"he\" and \"she\", like ''dia'' in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], ''\u0151'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and ''o'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. These languages might only have different pronouns and inflections in the [[grammatical person|third person]] to differentiate between people and inanimate objects, but even this distinction is often absent. (In written [[Finnish grammar|Finnish]], for example, ''h\u00e4n'' is used for \"he\" and \"she\" and ''se'' for \"it\", but in the colloquial language ''se'' is usually used for \"he\" and \"she\" as well.)\n\nFor more on these different types of pronoun, see [[Gender-specific pronoun]] and [[Gender-neutral pronoun]]. Issues may arise in languages with gender-specific pronouns in cases when the gender of the referent is unknown or not specified; this is discussed under [[Gender-neutral language]], and in relation to English at [[Singular they|Singular ''they'']].\n\nIn some cases the gender of a pronoun is not marked in the form of the pronoun itself, but is marked on other words by way of agreement. Thus the French word for \"I\" is ''je'', regardless of who is speaking; but this word becomes feminine or masculine depending on the sex of the speaker, as may be reflected through adjective agreement: ''je suis fort'''e''''' (\"I am strong\", spoken by a female); ''je suis fort'' (the same spoken by a male).\n\nIn [[null-subject language]]s (and in some [[ellipsis (grammar)|elliptical]] expressions in other languages), such agreement may take place even though the pronoun does not in fact appear. For example, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:\n* \"[I am] very grateful\", said by a male: ''muito obrigad'''o'''''\n* the same, said by a female: ''muito obrigad'''a'''''\nThe two sentences above mean literally \"much obliged\"; the adjective agrees with the natural gender of the speaker, that is, with the gender of the first person pronoun which does not appear explicitly here.\n\n==={{anchor|Indefinite pronouns|Dummy pronouns}}Indefinite and dummy pronouns===\nA [[dummy pronoun]] is a type of pronoun used when a particular verb argument (such as the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]) is nonexistent, but when a reference to the argument is nevertheless syntactically required. They occur mostly in non-[[pro-drop language]]s, such as English (because in pro-drop languages the position of the argument can be left empty). Examples in English are the uses of ''it'' in \"It's raining\" and \"It's nice to relax.\"\n\nWhen a language has gendered pronouns, the use of a particular word as a dummy pronoun may involve the selection of a particular gender, even though there is no noun to agree with. In languages with a neuter gender, a neuter pronoun is usually used, as in German ''es regnet'' (\"it rains, it's raining\"), where ''es'' is the neuter third person singular pronoun. (English behaves similarly, because the word ''it'' comes from the [[Old English]] neuter gender.) In languages with only masculine and feminine genders, the dummy pronoun may be the masculine third person singular, as in the French for \"it's raining\": ''il pleut'' (where ''il'' means \"he\", or \"it\" when referring to masculine nouns); although some languages use the feminine, as in the equivalent [[Welsh language|Welsh]] sentence: ''mae hi'n bwrw glaw'' (where the dummy pronoun is ''hi'', which means \"she\", or \"it\" when referring to feminine nouns).\n\nA similar, apparently arbitrary gender assignment may need to be made in the case of [[indefinite pronoun]]s, where the referent is generally unknown. In this case the question is usually not which pronoun to use, but which gender to assign a given pronoun to (for such purposes as adjective agreement).  For example, the French pronouns ''quelqu'un'' (\"someone\"), ''personne'' (\"no-one\") and ''quelque chose'' (\"something\") are all treated as masculine \u2013 this is in spite of the fact that the last two correspond to feminine nouns (''personne'' meaning \"person\", and ''chose'' meaning \"thing\").<ref>Monique L'Huillier, ''Advanced French Grammar'', Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 401.</ref>\n\nFor other situations in which such a \"default\" gender assignment may be required, see {{slink||Mixed and indeterminate gender}} below.\n\n==Grammatical vs. natural gender <span id=\"Natural gender\"></span>==\nThe ''natural gender'' of a noun, pronoun or noun phrase is a gender to which it would be expected to belong based on relevant attributes of its referent. This usually means masculine or feminine, depending on the referent's sex (or [[gender]] in the sociological sense). For example, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''mujer'' (\"woman\") is feminine whereas ''hombre'' (\"man\") is masculine; these attributions occur solely due to the semantically inherent gender character of each noun.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe ''grammatical gender'' of a noun does not always coincide with its natural gender. An example of this is the [[German language|German]] word ''M\u00e4dchen'' (\"girl\"); this is derived from ''Maid'' \"maiden\", [[Germanic Umlaut|umlaut]]ed to \"M\u00e4d-\" with the [[diminutive suffix]] ''-chen'', and this suffix always makes the noun grammatically neuter. Hence the grammatical gender of ''M\u00e4dchen'' is neuter, although its natural gender is feminine (because it refers to a female person).\n\nOther examples include:\n* [[Old English]] ''w\u012bf'' (neuter) and ''w\u012bfmann'' (masculine), meaning \"woman\"\n* [[German language|German]] ''Weib'' (neuter), meaning \"woman\" (the word is now pejorative and generally replaced with 'die Frau', originally 'lady', fem. of obsolete 'der [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/frawj\u00f4|Fro]]', meaning 'lord')\n* [[Irish language|Irish]] ''cail\u00edn'' (masculine) meaning \"girl\", and ''stail'' (feminine) meaning \"stallion\"\n* [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] ''boireannach'' (masculine), meaning \"woman\"\n* [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] ''dekle'' (neuter), meaning \"girl\"\n* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mulher\u00e3o'' (masculine), meaning \"voluptuous woman\"\n\nNormally, such exceptions are a small minority.\n\nWhen a noun with conflicting natural and grammatical gender is the antecedent of a pronoun, it may not be clear which gender of pronoun to choose. There is a certain tendency to keep the grammatical gender when a close back-reference is made, but to switch to natural gender when the reference is further away. For example, in German, the sentences \"The girl has come home from school. She is now doing her homework\" can be translated in two ways:\n* ''Das <u>M\u00e4dchen</u> (n.) ist aus der Schule gekommen. '''Es''' (n.) macht jetzt '''seine''' (n.) Hausaufgaben.''\n* ''Das <u>M\u00e4dchen</u> (n.) ist aus der Schule gekommen. '''Sie''' (f.) macht jetzt '''ihre''' (f.) Hausaufgaben.''\nThough the second sentence may appear grammatically incorrect ([[Synesis|constructio ad sensum]]), it is common in speech. With one or more intervening sentences, the second form becomes even more likely. However, a switch to the natural gender is never possible with articles and ''attributive'' pronouns or adjectives. Thus it can never be correct to say ''*eine M\u00e4dchen'' (\"a girl\" \u2013 with female indefinite article) or ''*diese kleine M\u00e4dchen'' (\"this little girl\" \u2013 with female demonstrative pronoun and adjective).\n\nThis phenomenon is quite popular in Slavic languages: for example Polish ''kreatura'' (deprecative \"creature\") is feminine but can be used to refer both man (masculine gender), woman (feminine gender), child (neuter gender) or even animate nouns (e.g. a dog being masculine). Similarly with other deprecatory nouns as ''pierdo\u0142a'', ''ciapa'', ''\u0142amaga'', ''\u0142ajza'', ''niezdara'' (\"wuss, klutz\"); ''niemowa'' (\"mute\") can used deprecatively as described previously, and then can be used for verbs marked for the male and female genders.\n\n===Animals===\nIn the case of languages which have masculine and feminine genders, the relation between biological sex and grammatical gender tends to be less exact in the case of animals than in the case of people. In Spanish, for instance, a [[cheetah]] is always ''un guepardo'' (masculine) and a [[zebra]] is always ''una cebra'' (feminine), regardless of their biological sex. To specify the sex of an animal, an adjective may be added, as in ''un guepardo hembra'' (\"a female cheetah\"), or ''una cebra macho'' (\"a male zebra\"). [[Suppletion|Different names]] for the male and the female of a species are more frequent for common pets or farm animals, e.g. English ''cow'' and ''bull'', Spanish ''vaca'' \"cow\" and ''toro'' \"bull\".\n\nAs regards the pronouns used to refer to animals, these generally agree in gender with the nouns denoting those animals, rather than the animals' sex (natural gender). In a language like English, which does not assign grammatical gender to nouns, the pronoun used for referring to objects (''it'') is often used for animals also. However, if the sex of the animal is known, and particularly in the case of companion animals, the gendered pronouns (''he'' and ''she'') may be used as they would be for a human.\n\nIn [[Polish language|Polish]], a few general words such as ''zwierz\u0119'' (\"animal\") or ''bydl\u0119'' (\"animal, one head of cattle\") are neuter, but most species names are masculine or feminine. When the sex of an animal is known, it will normally be referred to using gendered pronouns consistent with its sex; otherwise the pronouns will correspond to the gender of the noun denoting its species.\n\n==Mixed and indeterminate gender==\nThere are certain situations where the assignment of gender to a noun, pronoun or noun phrase may not be straightforward. This includes in particular:\n* groups of mixed gender;\n* references to people or things of unknown or unspecified gender.\n\nIn languages with masculine and feminine gender, the masculine is usually employed by default to refer to persons of unknown gender, and to groups of people of mixed gender. Thus, in French the feminine plural pronoun ''elles'' always designates an all-female group of people (or stands for a group of nouns all of feminine gender), but the masculine equivalent ''ils'' may refer to a group of males or masculine nouns, to a mixed group, or to a group of people of unknown genders. In such cases, one says that the feminine gender is [[markedness|semantically marked]], whereas the masculine gender is unmarked.\n\nIn English, the problem of gender determination does not arise in the plural, because gender in that language is reflected only in pronouns, and the plural pronoun ''they'' does not have gendered forms. In the singular, however, the issue frequently arises when a person of unspecified or unknown gender is being referred to. In this case it has been traditional to use the masculine (''he''), but other solutions are now often preferred \u2013 see [[Gender-neutral language]] and [[Singular they|Singular ''they'']].\n\nIn languages with a neuter gender, such as [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Germanic languages]], the neuter is often used for indeterminate gender reference, particularly when the things referred to are not people. In some cases this may even apply when referring to people, particularly children. For example, in English, one may use ''it'' to refer to a child, particularly when speaking generically rather than about a particular child of known sex.\n\nIn [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (which preserves a masculine\u2013feminine\u2013neuter distinction in both singular and plural), the neuter is used for indeterminate or mixed gender reference even when talking about people. For example, the greeting ''velkominn'' (\"welcome\") is altered depending on who is being spoken to:\n* ''velkom'''inn''''' (masculine singular) \u2013 to one male person\n* ''velkom'''in''''' (feminine singular) \u2013 to one female person\n* ''velkom'''i\u00f0''''' (neuter singular) \u2013 to someone whose gender is unknown\n* ''velkom'''nir''''' (masculine plural) \u2013 to a group of males\n* ''velkom'''nar''''' (feminine plural) \u2013 to a group of females\n* ''velkom'''in''''' (neuter plural) \u2013 to a mixed or indeterminate group\nNevertheless, even in Icelandic, the feminine is considered somewhat more marked than the masculine.\n\nIn [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (which has an overall common\u2013neuter gender system), masculinity may be argued to be a marked feature, because in the [[Swedish grammar#Weak inflection|weak adjectival declension]] there is a distinct ending (''-e'') for naturally masculine nouns (as in ''min lill'''e'''bror'', \"my little brother\"). In spite of this, the third-person singular masculine pronoun ''han'' would normally be the default for a person of unknown gender, although in practice the indefinite pronoun ''man'' and the reflexive ''sig'' or its possessive forms ''sin/sitt/sina'' usually make this unnecessary.\n\nIn [[Polish language|Polish]], where a gender-like distinction is made in the plural between \"masculine personal\" and all other cases (see [[#Slavic languages|below]]), a group is treated as masculine personal if it contains at least one male person.\n\nIn languages which preserve a three-way gender division in the plural, the rules for determining the gender (and sometimes number) of a [[coordination (linguistics)|coordinated]] noun phrase (\"... and ...\") may be quite complex. [[Czech language|Czech]] is an example of such a language, with a division (in the plural) between masculine animate, masculine inanimate, feminine, and neuter. The rules<ref>[http://prirucka.ujc.cas.cz/?id=601 ''Shoda p\u0159\u00edsudku s podm\u011btem n\u011bkolikan\u00e1sobn\u00fdm''], [[Institute of the Czech Language]] of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic</ref> for gender and number of coordinated phrases in that language are summarized at {{slink|Czech declension|Gender and number of compound phrases}}.\n\n==Gender correspondence between languages==\nNouns which have the same meanings in different languages need not have the same gender. This is particularly so in the case of things with no natural gender, such as sexless objects. There is nothing objective about a table, for example, which would cause it to be associated with any particular gender, and different languages' words for \"table\" are found to have various genders: feminine, as with the French ''table''; masculine, as with German ''Tisch''; or neuter, as with [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''bord''. (Even within a given language, nouns that denote the same concept may differ in gender \u2013 for example, of two German words for \"car\", ''Wagen'' is masculine whereas ''Auto'' is neuter.)\n\n[[Cognate]] nouns in closely related languages are likely to have the same gender, because they tend to inherit the gender of the original word in the parent language. For instance, in the [[Romance languages]], the words for \"sun\" are masculine, being derived from the Latin masculine noun ''sol'', whereas the words for \"moon\" are feminine, being derived from the Latin feminine ''luna''. (This contrasts with the genders found in German, where ''Sonne'' \"sun\" is feminine, and ''Mond'' \"moon\" is masculine.) However, there are exceptions to this principle. For instance, ''arte'' (\"art\") is feminine in Italian, like the Latin word ''ars'' from which it stems, but in French, the corresponding word ''art'' is masculine. Likewise, the word for \"boat\" is neuter in German (''das Boot''), but common gender in Swedish (''en b\u00e5t'').\n\nSome more examples of the above phenomena are given below. (These come mostly from the Slavic languages, where gender largely correlates with the noun ending.)\n* The Russian word \u043b\u0443\u043d\u0430 (\"moon\") is feminine, whereas \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446 (\"[[Lunar phase|crescent moon]]\", also meaning \"month\") is masculine. In Polish, another Slavic language, the word for moon is ''ksi\u0119\u017cyc'', which is masculine.\n* Russian also has two words for \"potato\": \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c which is masculine, and \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0430 which is feminine.\n* In Polish the loanword ''tramwaj'' (\"tram\") is masculine, whereas the cognate loanword in Czech, ''tramvaj'', is feminine. In Romanian, ''tramvai'' is neuter.\n* The Polish word ''tysi\u0105c'' (\"thousand\") is masculine, whereas the cognate in Russian, \u0442\u044b\u0441\u044f\u0447\u0430, is feminine.\n* The Spanish word ''origen'' (\"origin\") is masculine, but its close relatives ''origem'' (from Portuguese) and ''orixe'' (from Galician and Asturian) are feminine.\n* The French word ''\u00e9quipe'' (\"team\") is feminine, while the Spanish word ''equipo'' is masculine. The Spanish form contrasts with Brazilian Portuguese ''equipe'' and European Portuguese ''equipa'', both of which are feminine.\n* The Italian word ''scimmia'' (\"ape\") is feminine, whereas the Spanish word ''simio'' is masculine.\n\n===Gender in words borrowed from one language by another===\nIbrahim identifies several processes by which a language assigns a gender to a newly borrowed word; these processes follow patterns by which even children, through their subconscious recognition of patterns, can often correctly predict a noun's gender.{{sfn|Ibrahim|1973|p=61}}\n# If the noun is animate, natural gender tends to dictate grammatical gender.\n# The borrowed word tends to take the gender of the native word it replaces.\n# If the borrowed word happens to have a suffix that the borrowing language uses as a gender marker, the suffix tends to dictate gender.\n# If the borrowed word rhymes with one or more native words, the latter tend to dictate gender.\n# The default assignment is the borrowing language's unmarked gender.\n# Rarely, the word retains the gender it had in the donor language. This tends to happen more frequently in more formal language such as scientific terms, where some knowledge of the donor language can be expected.\n\nSometimes the gender of a word switches with time. For example, the Russian modern loanword ''\u0432\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438'' (''viski'') \"whisky\" was originally feminine,<ref>In a translation of [[Jack London]] stories, 1915</ref> then masculine,<ref>In a song of [[Alexander Vertinsky]], 1920s or 1930s</ref> and today it has become neuter.\n\n==Useful roles==\n\nIbrahim identified three possible useful roles of grammatical gender:{{sfn|Ibrahim|1973|pp=27\u201328}}\n# In a language with explicit inflections for gender, it is easy to express the natural gender of animate beings.\n# Grammatical gender \"can be a valuable tool of disambiguation\", rendering clarity about antecedents.\n# In literature, gender can be used to \"animate and personify inanimate nouns\".\n\nAmong these, role 2 is probably the most important in everyday usage.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Languages with gender distinction generally have fewer cases of ambiguity concerning, for example, pronominal reference. In the English phrase \"''a flowerbed in the garden which I maintain''\" only context tells us whether the relative clause (''which I maintain'') refers to the whole garden or just the flowerbed. In German, gender distinction prevents such ambiguity. The word for \"(flower) bed\" (''Beet'') is neuter, whereas that for \"garden\" (''Garten'') is masculine. Hence, if a neuter relative pronoun is used, the relative clause refers to \"bed\", and if a masculine pronoun is used, the relative clause refers to \"garden\". Because of this, languages with gender distinction can often use pronouns where in English a noun would have to be repeated in order to avoid confusion. It does not, however, help in cases where the words are of the same grammatical gender. (There are often several synonymous nouns of different grammatical gender to pick from to avoid this, however.)\n\nMoreover, grammatical gender may serve to distinguish [[homophone]]s. It is a quite common phenomenon in language development for two [[phoneme]]s to merge, thereby making etymologically distinct words sound alike. In languages with gender distinction, however, these word pairs may still be distinguishable by their gender. For example, French ''pot'' (\"pot\") and ''peau'' (\"skin\") are homophones /po/, but disagree in gender: ''le pot'' vs. ''la peau''.\n\n==Influence on culture==\nAccording to research by [[Lera Boroditsky]], grammatical genders are among the aspects of languages that shape how people think (a hypothesis called \"[[linguistic relativity]]\").<ref>{{cite web |last1=Warner |first1=James |title=Linguistic Relativism and Grammatical Gender. |website=Identity Theory |accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> In one study by Boroditsky, in which native speakers of German and Spanish were asked to describe everyday objects in English, she found that they were more likely to use attributes conventionally associated with the genders of the objects in their native languages.\n\nFor instance, German speakers more often described ''{{lang|de|Br\u00fccke}} (f.)'' \"bridge\" with words like 'beautiful', 'elegant', 'fragile', 'peaceful', 'pretty', and 'slender', whereas Spanish speakers, which use ''puente (m.)'' used terms like 'big', 'dangerous', 'long', 'strong', 'sturdy', and 'towering'.\n\nAlso according to Boroditsky, the gender in which concepts are [[anthropomorphized]] in art is dependent, in 85% of all cases, on the grammatical gender of the concept in the artist's language. Therefore, in German art ''Tod (m.)'' \"[[death]]\" is generally portrayed as a man, but in Russian art ''\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044c (f.)'' \"death\" is generally portrayed as a woman.<ref name=\"Edge\">{{cite news| last=Boroditsky| first=Lera| title=How does our language shape the way we think?| url= http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/boroditsky09/boroditsky09_index.html | accessdate=29 October 2010| newspaper=[[Edge \u2013 the third culture|Edge]]| date=2009-06-11}}</ref> \nA problem with such arguments is that, as argued by [[Ad\u00e8le Mercier]], in French and many other languages the same class of objects can be referred to by words of different grammatical gender.<ref>Mercier 2002, pp. 498\u2013500.</ref>\n\nSome languages, such as Armenian, lack grammatical gender for both pronouns and nouns. In a recent study by [[Rafik Santrosyan]] native speakers of Armenian were given [[epicene]] (gender-neutral) words denoting different occupations. The subjects predominantly associated words that imply high agency (e.g. leader, mayor, doctor etc.) with maleness, and words denoting subservient and sexually objectified positions with femaleness. Santrosyan concludes that the cultural understanding of gender in Contemporary Armenian is constructed around the axis of agency.<ref>https://www.evnreport.com/arts-and-culture/sex-vs-gender-through-linguistic-expression-in-armenian</ref>\n\n==By language==\n{{see also|List of languages by type of grammatical genders}}\nGrammatical gender is a common phenomenon in the world's languages.{{sfn|Foley & Van Valin|1984|p=326}} A typological survey of 174 languages revealed that over one fourth of them had grammatical gender.{{sfn|Nichols|1992}} Gender systems rarely overlap with numerical [[noun classifier|classifier]] systems. Gender and noun class systems are usually found in [[fusional language|fusional]] or [[agglutinating language|agglutinating]] languages, whereas classifiers are more typical of [[isolating language]]s.{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=77}} Thus, according to [[Johanna Nichols]], these characteristics correlate positively with the presence of grammatical gender in the world's languages:{{sfn|Franceschina|2005|p=77}}\n* location in an area with languages featuring noun classes;\n* preference for [[head (linguistics)|head]]-marking morphology;\n* moderate to high morphological complexity;\n* non-accusative [[morphosyntactic alignment|alignment]].\n\n===Indo-European===\nMany [[Indo-European languages]], but not English, provide archetypical examples of grammatical gender.\n\nResearch indicates that the earliest stages of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] had two genders (animate and inanimate), as did [[Hittite language|Hittite]], the earliest attested Indo-European language. The classification of nouns based on animacy and inanimacy and the lack of gender are today characteristic of [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. According to the theory, the animate gender, which (unlike the inanimate) had independent vocative and accusative forms, later split into masculine and feminine, thus originating the three-way classification into masculine, feminine and neuter.<ref>[http://www.zompist.com/lang21.html#28 How did genders and cases develop in Indo-European?]</ref><ref>[http://homer.members.pgv.at/INDOEURO/gender.htm The Original Nominal System of Proto-Indoeuropean \u2013 Case and Gender] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030124214/http://homer.members.pgv.at/INDOEURO/gender.htm |date=2013-10-30 }}</ref><!-- Both sources are very short, snippets really. One is dubious, the other confused. Both cite no nice body of research to check up on.-->\n\nMany Indo-European languages retained the three genders, including most [[Slavic languages]], [[Latin]], [[Sanskrit]], Ancient and Modern [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[German language|German]]. In them, there is a high but not absolute correlation between grammatical gender and [[declension]]al class. Many linguists believe that to be true of the middle and late stages of Proto-Indo-European.\n\nHowever, many languages reduced the number of genders to two. Some lost the neuter, leaving masculine and feminine like most [[Romance languages]] (see {{slink|Vulgar Latin|Loss of neuter gender}}. A few traces of the neuter remain, such as the distinct [[Spanish pronouns|Spanish pronoun]] ''ello'' and Italian nouns with so-called \"mobile gender\"), as well as [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and the [[Celtic languages]]. Others merged feminine and masculine into a common gender but retained the neuter, as in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] (and, to some extent, [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; see [[Gender in Danish and Swedish]] and [[Gender in Dutch grammar]]). Finally, some languages, such as English and [[Afrikaans]], have nearly completely lost grammatical gender (retaining only some traces, such as the English pronouns ''he'', ''she'', ''they'', and ''it'' \u2014 Afrikaans ''hy'', ''sy'', ''hulle'', and ''dit''); [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Ossetian language|Ossetic]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Khowar language|Khowar]], and [[Kalasha-mun|Kalasha]] have lost it entirely.\n\nOn the other hand, some [[Slavic languages]] can be argued to have added new genders to the classical three (see [[#Slavic languages|below]]).\n\n====English====\n{{Main|Gender in English}}\nAlthough grammatical gender was a fully productive inflectional category in [[Old English]], Modern English has a much less pervasive gender system, primarily based on natural gender and reflected essentially in pronouns only.\n\nThere are a few traces of gender marking in Modern English:\n* Some words take different [[Morphological derivation|derived]] forms depending on the natural gender of the referent, such as ''actor/actress'' and ''widow/widower''.\n* The third-person singular [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]] (and their possessive forms) are gender specific: ''he/him/his'' (masculine gender, used for men, boys, and male animals), ''she/her(s)'' (feminine gender, for women, girls, and female animals), the [[singular they|singular]] ''they/them/their(s)'' (neuter gender, used for people or animals of unknown, irrelevant, or non-binary gender),  and ''it/its'' (neuter gender, mainly for objects, abstractions and animals). (There are also distinct personal and non-personal forms but no differentiation by natural gender in the case of certain interrogative and [[English relative clauses|relative pronouns]]: ''who/whom'' for persons, corresponding to ''he'', ''she'', and the singular ''they''; and ''which'' corresponding to ''it''.)\n\nHowever, these are relatively insignificant features compared with a typical language with full grammatical gender. English nouns are not generally considered to belong to gender classes in the way that French, German or Russian nouns are. There is no gender agreement in English between nouns and their modifiers ([[article (grammar)|article]]s, other [[determiner]]s, or [[adjective]]s, with the occasional exception such as ''blond/blonde'', a spelling convention borrowed from French). Gender agreement applies in effect only to pronouns, and the choice of pronoun is determined based on semantics (perceived qualities of the thing being referred to) rather than on any conventional assignment of particular nouns to particular genders.\n\nOnly a relatively small number of English nouns have distinct male and female forms; many of them are [[loanword]]s from non-[[Germanic language]]s (the suffixes ''-ress'' and ''-rix'' in words such as ''actress'' and ''aviatrix'', for instance, derive from Latin ''-rix'', in the first case via the French ''-rice''). English has no live [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] gender [[marker (linguistics)|marker]]s. An example of such a marker might be the suffix ''-ette'' (of French provenance), but this is seldom used today, surviving mostly in either historical contexts or with disparaging or humorous intent.\n\nThe gender of an English pronoun typically coincides with the natural gender of its referent, rather than with the grammatical gender of its [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]. The choice between ''she'', ''he'', ''they'', and ''it'' comes down to whether the pronoun is intended to designate a woman, a man, or someone or something else. There are certain exceptions, however:\n* With animals, ''it'' is usually used, but when the sex of the animal is known, it may be referred to as ''he'' or ''she'' (particularly when expressing an emotional connection with the animal, as with a [[pet animal|pet]]). See also {{slink||Animals}} above.\n* Certain nonhuman things are referred to with the pronoun ''she'' (''her'', ''hers''), particularly countries and ships, and sometimes other vehicles or machines. See {{slink|Gender in English|Ships}}. That usage is considered an optional [[figure of speech]]; it is also in decline, and advised against by most journalistic style guides.<ref>''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', 15th edition, 2003, p. 356. {{ISBN|0-226-10403-6}}.</ref>\n\nProblems arise when selecting a personal pronoun to refer to someone of unspecified or unknown gender (see also {{slink||Mixed and indeterminate gender}} above). In the past and to some degree still in the present, the masculine has been used as the \"default\" gender in English. The use of the plural pronoun ''they'' with singular reference is common in practice. The neuter ''it'' may be used for a baby but not normally for an older child or adult. (Other genderless pronouns exist, such as the impersonal pronoun ''one'', but they are not generally substitutable for a personal pronoun.) For more information see [[Gender-neutral language]] and [[Singular they|Singular ''they'']].\n\n====Slavic languages====\nThe [[Slavic languages]] mostly continue the Proto-Indo-European system of three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter. Gender correlates largely with noun endings (masculine nouns typically end in a consonant, feminines in ''-a'' and neuters in ''-o'') but there are many exceptions, particularly in the case of nouns whose stems end in a [[soft consonant]]. However, some of the languages, including [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], also make certain additional grammatical distinctions between [[animacy|animate]] and inanimate nouns: Polish in the plural, and Russian in the accusative case, differentiate between human and non-human nouns.\n\nIn Russian, the different treatment of animate nouns involves their accusative case (and that of adjectives qualifying them) being formed identically to the genitive rather than to the nominative. In the singular that applies to masculine nouns only, but in the plural it applies in all genders. See [[Russian declension]].\n\nA similar system applies in Czech, but the situation is somewhat different in the plural: Only masculine nouns are affected, and the distinctive feature is a distinct inflective ending for masculine animate nouns in the nominative plural and for adjectives and verbs agreeing with those nouns. See [[Czech declension]].\n\nPolish might be said to distinguish five genders: personal masculine (referring to male humans), animate non-personal masculine, inanimate masculine, feminine, and neuter. The animate\u2013inanimate opposition for the masculine gender applies in the singular, and the personal\u2013impersonal opposition, which classes animals along with inanimate objects, applies in the plural. (A few nouns denoting inanimate things are treated grammatically as animate and vice versa.) The manifestations of the differences are as follows:\n* In the singular, masculine animates (in the standard declension) have an accusative form identical to the genitive, and masculine inanimates have accusative identical to the nominative. The same applies to adjectives qualifying these nouns, the same as in Russian and Czech. Also, Polish masculine animates always form their genitive in ''-a'', whereas in the case of inanimates some use ''-a'' and some ''-u'':\n::animate: ''dobry klient'' (\"good customer\"; nominative); ''dobrego klienta'' (accusative and genitive)\n::animate: ''dobry pies'' (\"good dog\"; nominative); ''dobrego psa'' (accusative and genitive)\n::inanimate: ''dobry ser'' (\"good cheese\"; nominative and accusative); ''dobrego sera'' (genitive only)\n* In the plural, masculine personal nouns (but not other animate nouns) take accusatives that are identical to the genitives; they also typically take different endings in the nominative (e.g. ''-i'' rather than ''-y''). Such endings also appear on adjectives and past tense verbs. The two features are analogous to features of Russian and Czech respectively, except that those languages make an animate/inanimate distinction rather than personal/impersonal) . Examples of the Polish system:\n::personal: ''dobrzy klienci'' (\"good customers\"; nominative); ''dobrych klient\u00f3w'' (accusative and genitive)\n::impersonal: ''dobre psy'' (\"good dogs\"; nominative and accusative); ''dobrych ps\u00f3w'' (genitive only)\n::impersonal: ''dobre sery'' (\"good cheeses\"; nominative and accusative); ''dobrych ser\u00f3w'' (genitive only)\n\nA few nouns have both personal and impersonal forms, depending on meaning (for example, ''klient'' may behave as an impersonal noun when it refers to a [[client (computing)|client]] in the computing sense). For more information on the above inflection patterns, see [[Polish morphology]]. For certain rules concerning the treatment of mixed-gender groups, see {{slink||Mixed and indeterminate gender}} above.\n\n===Dravidian===\nIn the [[Dravidian languages]], nouns are classified primarily on the basis of their semantic properties. The highest-level classification of nouns is often described as being between \"rational\" and \"nonrational\".{{sfn|Corbett|1991|pp=8\u201311}} Nouns representing humans and [[deity|deities]] are considered rational, and other nouns (those representing animals and objects) are treated as nonrational. Within the rational class there are further subdivisions into masculine, feminine and [[collective noun]]s. For further information, see [[Tamil grammar]].\n\n===Other===\n* In the Austronesian [[Wuvulu-Aua language]], [[vocative case|vocative]] words used when addressing a relative often specify the speaker's gender. For example, ''tafi'' means 'sister of female', ''\u0294ari'' means opposite-gender sibling, and ''wane'' means female's father's sister or female's brother's daughter.<ref name=Hafford>{{Cite book| title=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary| last=Hafford| first=James A| page=63| publisher=| year=| isbn=| location=| quote=| via=}}</ref>\nSee also [[Gender-neutrality in languages with grammatical gender#International auxiliary languages|Gender-neutrality in languages with grammatical gender: International auxiliary languages]] and [[Gender-specific pronoun#Constructed languages|Gender-specific pronoun: Constructed languages]].\n\n===Constructed languages===\nMany [[constructed language]]s have natural gender systems similar to that of English. Animate nouns can have distinct forms reflecting natural gender, and personal pronouns are selected according to natural gender. Some constructed languages have no gender agreement on modifiers.\n\n====Auxiliary languages====\n* [[Esperanto]] has no grammatical gender. The female suffix ''-in-'', sometimes quoted as an example, is simply one of many suffixes intended to simplify the vocabulary and make the language easier and faster to learn. There are no accompanying features of grammatical gender (such as different articles or markers applying to associated adjectives).  Although it differentiates a small number of male and female nouns, such as ''patro'' (father) and ''patrino'' (mother) for the reason described above, most nouns are gender-neutral and the use of it is not necessary. For instance, ''hundo'' means either a male or female dog, ''virhundo'' means a male dog, and ''hundino'' means a female dog. [[Esperanto grammar#Personal pronouns|Personal pronouns]] ''li'' (he) and ''\u015di'' (she) and their possessive forms ''lia'' (his) and ''\u015dia'' (her) are used for male and female antecedents, and ''\u011di'' (it) and its possessive form ''\u011dia'' (its) are used to refer to a nonpersonal antecedent.\n* [[Ido language|Ido]] has the masculine infix ''-ul'' and the feminine infix ''-in'' for animate beings. Both are optional and used only if it is necessary to avoid ambiguity: ''kato'' \"a cat\", ''katulo'' \"a male cat\", ''katino'' \"a female cat\". There are third-person singular and plural pronouns for all three genders, ''masculine'', ''feminine'', and ''neuter'', but also ''gender-free'' pronouns.\n* [[Interlingua]] has no grammatical gender. It indicates only the natural gender, as in ''matre'' \"mother\" and ''patre'' \"father\". Interlingua speakers may use feminine endings. For example, ''-a'' may be used in place of ''-o'' in ''catto'', producing ''catta'' \"female cat\". ''Professora'' may be used to denote a professor who is female, and ''actrice'' may be used to mean \"actress\". As in Ido, inflections marking gender are optional, but some gender-specific nouns such as ''femina'', \"woman\", happen to end in ''-a'' or ''-o''. Interlingua [[Interlingua grammar|has feminine pronouns]], and its general pronoun forms are also used as masculine pronouns.\n\n====Artistic languages====\n* The [[Klingon language]] by [[Marc Okrand]] divides nouns into ''beings capable of using language'', ''body parts'' and others. Regular nouns in these categories form plurals with the endings ''-pu{{'}}'', ''-Du{{'}}'' and ''-mey'' respectively. The first category also has a separate possessive suffix in the first and second persons.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Klingon Dictionary (Star Trek) |first=Marc |last=Okrand |authorlink=Marc Okrand |page=165 |year=1992 |isbn=978-0671745592}}</ref>\n* [[High Valyrian]], built by [[David J. Peterson]] for the TV series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', has four grammatical genders, none of which are related to natural gender (see also [[Valyrian languages#Nouns]]).\n* [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], created by J.R.R. Tolkien, do not have grammatical gender. However, both languages do have some nouns marked for natural gender; for example, Quenya ''seldo'' 'child (m.)', ''selde'' 'child (f.)', ''selda'' 'child (n.)'.<ref>Thorsten Renk http://www.ambar-eldaron.com/thorsten/agental_gender.html</ref> Modifiers in Quenya agree with their head noun in number only.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gender-neutral language]]\n* [[Gender neutrality in genderless languages]]\n* [[Gender neutrality in languages with grammatical gender]]\n* [[Gender-neutral language in English]]\n* [[Gender-specific job title]]\n* [[Generic antecedents]]\n* [[Grammatical conjugation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|title=Spanish: An Essential Grammar|last=Bradley|first=Peter|year=2004 |isbn= 978-0415286435 |edition=1  |ref=harv}}\n* Craig, Colette G.

There were, however, some exceptions. For example, in the 17th century cross dressing was common in plays, as evident in the content of many of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays and by the actors in actual performance (since female roles in [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan theater]] were always performed by males, usually [[prepubescent]] [[boy]]s).\n\n[[Thomas Cannon]] wrote what may be the earliest published defense of homosexuality in English, ''Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplify'd'' (1749).

His advocacy stemmed from his [[utilitarianism|utilitarian philosophy]], in which the morality of an action is determined by the net consequence of that action on human well-being. He argued that homosexuality was a victimless crime, and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges. He regarded popular negative attitudes against homosexuality as an irrational prejudice, fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings.<ref>[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham, Jeremy]], ''Offences Against One's Self'', c1785  ([http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/bentham/index.html full text online]).</ref> However, he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal; his powerful essay was not published until 1978.\n\nThe emerging currents of [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] thought which had inspired Bentham also informed the [[French Revolution]], and when the newly formed [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] began drafting the policies and laws of the new republic in 1792, groups of militant \"sodomite-citizens\" in Paris petitioned the [[Assembl\u00e9e nationale]], the governing body of the [[French Revolution]], for freedom and recognition.<ref name=\"blasius\">Blasius, Mark and Phelan, Shane (eds.), 1997. \"We Are Everywhere: A Historical Sourcebook of Gay and Lesbian Politics\", New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-90859-0}}</ref> In 1791, France became the first nation to decriminalize homosexuality, probably thanks in part to [[Jean Jacques R\u00e9gis de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s]], who was one of the authors of the [[Napoleonic Code]].

In 1885 the [[Labouchere Amendment]] was included in the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|Criminal Law Amendment Act]], which criminalized 'any act of gross indecency with another male person'; a charge that was successfully invoked to convict playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] in 1895 with the most severe sentence possible under the Act.\n\nFrom the 1870s, [[social reform]]ers began to defend homosexuality, but due to the controversial nature of their advocacy, kept their identities secret.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A secret British society called the \"[[Order of Chaeronea]]\" campaigned for the legalisation of homosexuality, and counted playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] among its members in the last decades of the 19th century.<ref>McKenna, Neil (2003), \"The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde: An Intimate Biography\".

Members included [[Charles Kains Jackson]], [[Samuel Elsworth Cottam]], [[Montague Summers]], and [[John Gambril Nicholson]].\n\n[[John Addington Symonds]] was a poet and an early advocate of male love. In 1873, he wrote ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'', a work of what would later be called \"[[gay history]].\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Katz|title=Love Stories|pages=243\u2013244}}</ref> Although the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits the medical writer [[Charles Gilbert Chaddock|C.G.

By the end of his life, Symonds' homosexuality had become an open secret in Victorian literary and cultural circles. In particular, Symonds' memoirs, written over a four-year period, from 1889 to 1893, form the earliest known self-conscious homosexual autobiography.\n\nAnother friend of Ives was the English [[socialism|socialist]] poet [[Edward Carpenter]]. Carpenter thought that homosexuality was an innate and natural human characteristic and that it should not be regarded as a sin or a criminal offence. In the 1890s, Carpenter began a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]], possibly in response to the recent death of Symonds, whom he viewed as his campaigning inspiration. His 1908 book on the subject, ''[[The Intermediate Sex]]'', would become a foundational text of the [[LGBT movements]] of the 20th century. Scottish [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[John Henry Mackay]] also wrote in defense of same-sex love and [[androgyny]].\n\nEnglish [[sexology|sexologist]] [[Havelock Ellis]] wrote the first objective scientific study of homosexuality in 1897, in which he treated it as a neutral sexual condition. Called ''Sexual Inversion'' it was first printed in German and then translated into English a year later. In the book, Ellis argued that same-sex relationships could not be characterized as a [[pathology]] or a [[crime]] and that its importance rose above the arbitrary restrictions imposed by society.<ref>''Das Kontr\u00e4re Geschlechtsgef\u00fchle''. Leipzig, 1896. See {{cite book|last=White|first=Chris|title=Nineteenth-Century Writings on Homosexuality|year=1999|publisher=CRC Press|page=66}}</ref> He also studied what he called 'inter-generational relationships' and that these also broke societal [[taboo]]s on age difference in sexual relationships. The book was so controversial at the time that one bookseller was charged in court for holding copies of the work. It is claimed that Ellis coined the term 'homosexual', but in fact he disliked the word due to its conflation of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]].\n\nThese early proponents of LGBT rights, such as Carpenter, were often aligned with a broader socio-political movement known as '[[free love]]'; a critique of [[Victorian morality|Victorian sexual morality]] and the traditional institutions of family and marriage that were seen to enslave women. Some advocates of free love in the early 20th century, including Russian anarchist and feminist [[Emma Goldman]], also spoke in defence of same-sex love and challenged repressive legislation.\n\nAn early LGBT movement also began in Germany at the turn of the 20th century, centering on the doctor and writer [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. In 1897 he formed the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] campaign publicly against the notorious law \"[[Paragraph 175]]\", which made sex between men illegal. [[Adolf Brand]] later broke away from the group, disagreeing with Hirschfeld's medical view of the \"[[Third gender|intermediate sex]]\", seeing male-male sex as merely an aspect of manly virility and male social bonding. Brand was the first to use \"[[outing]]\" as a political strategy, claiming that German [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Bernhard von B\u00fclow]] engaged in homosexual activity.\n\n[[File:Lesbiche - 1928 - D- Die freundin 1928.jpg|thumb|May 14, 1928 issue of German lesbian periodical ''Die Freundin'' (''The Girlfriend'').]]\n\nThe 1901 book ''Sind es Frauen?

R\u00fcling, who also saw \"men, women, and homosexuals\" as three distinct genders, called for an alliance between the women's and sexual reform movements, but this speech is her only known contribution to the cause. Women only began to join the previously male-dominated sexual reform movement around 1910 when the German government tried to expand Paragraph 175 to outlaw sex between women. Heterosexual feminist leader [[Helene St\u00f6cker]] became a prominent figure in the movement. [[Friedrich Radszuweit]] published LGBT literature and magazines in [[Berlin]] (e.g., ''Die Freundin'').\n\nHirschfeld, whose life was dedicated to social progress for people who were transsexual, transvestite and homosexual, formed the [[Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in 1919. The institute conducted an enormous amount of research, saw thousands of transgender and homosexual clients at consultations, and championed a broad range of sexual reforms including sex education, contraception and women's rights. However, the gains made in Germany would soon be [[History of Gays during the Holocaust|drastically reversed]] with the rise of [[Nazism]], and the institute and its library were destroyed in 1933.

Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of [[heterosexuality]] are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them. However, Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBT youth.<ref name=\"Campos\">{{cite book|author=Campos, David|title=Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook|location=Washington, D.C|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FKmVUwbUlGgC&printsec=copyright#v=onepage|isbn=978-1-57607-776-4}}</ref> It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these [[homosexual]] youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality.<ref name=\"Campos\" />\n\nMany opponents of LGBT social movements have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality as being a result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals.<ref name=\"Fetner\" /> In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in schools entirely.

Sherkat, Kylan M. de Vries, and Stacia Creek at the [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]],  researchers found that women tend to be more consistently supportive of LBGT rights than men and that individuals that are divorced or have never married are also more likely to grant marital rights to same-sex couples than married or widowed individuals. They also claimed that white women are significantly more supportive than white men, but there are no gender discrepancies among African Americans. The year in which one was born was also found to be a strong indicator of attitude towards same-sex marriage\u2014generations born after 1946 are considerably more supportive of same-sex marriage than older generations. Finally, the study reported that statistically African Americans are more opposed to same-sex marriage than any other ethnicity.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nStudies show that Non-Protestant Christians are much more likely to support same-sex unions than [[Protestants]]; 63% of African Americans claim that they are [[Black church|Baptist]] or Protestant, whereas only 30% of white Americans are. [[Religion]], as measured by individuals' religious affiliations, behaviors, and beliefs, has a lot of influence in structuring same-sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality. The most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by [[Jews]], liberal Protestants, and people who are not affiliated with religion. This is because many of their religious traditions have not \"systematically condemned homosexual behaviors\" in recent years. Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants. And lastly, the most conservative views are held by [[Evangelicalism in the United States|Evangelical Protestants]]. Moreover, it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation. Organized religion, especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations, espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same-sex unions. Therefore, these congregations are more likely to hear messages of this nature. Polls have also indicated that the amount and level of personal contact that individuals have with homosexual individuals and traditional morality affects attitudes of same-sex marriage and homosexuality.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Olson, Laura R.|author2=Wendy Cadge|author3=James T.

An original idea appears in [[Rafael Grugman]] dystopian fiction book ''[[Nontraditional Love]]'' (2008). He describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden. In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified in order to support the ideology of the homosexual world (in this world same-sex love is a traditional love). At the heart of the novel is a love story between a man and a woman who unfortunately were born as heterosexuals in a homosexual world and they forced to hide their feelings and their sexual orientation. For a homosexual society love between man and women is a non-traditional love. Underlying this story is the idea that society should be tolerant and accepting and respect the right of every person to be themselves. It is unusual approach that supports human rights of all people and same-sex marriages.<ref>{{cite book|first=Rafael|last=Grugman|title=Nontraditional Love|location=New York|publisher=Liberty Publishing House|year=2008}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Age of consent]]\n* [[Biphobia]]\n* [[Bisexuality in the United States]]\n* [[Civil rights]]\n* [[Coming out]]\n* [[Declaration of Montreal]]\n* [[Gay culture]]\n* [[Gay icon]]\n* [[Gay men in American history]]\n* [[GLSEN]]\n* [[Heterosexism]]\n* [[Homosexual agenda]]\n* [[Identity politics]]\n* [[International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia]]\n* [[Intersex human rights]]\n* [[Leicester Gay Liberation Front]]\n* [[Lesbian American history]]\n* [[LGBT movements in the United States]]\n* [[LGBT rights by country or territory]]\n* [[Lesbian separatism]]\n* [[List of gay-rights organizations]]\n* [[List of LGBT rights activists]]\n* [[List of social movements]]\n* [[Minority rights]]\n* [[Pink capitalism]]\n* [[Pro-gay slogans and symbols]]\n* [[Special rights]]\n* [[Spirit Day]]\n* [[Social stigma]] (Historic stigmatization of GLBT community and lifestyle)\n* [[Transgender American history]]\n* [[Transgender rights movement]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Barry D.

It is over {{convert|700|km|mi}} wide (from west to east) and covers an area of {{convert|348750|km2}} from the [[Eastern Goldfields]] region of Western Australia to the [[Gawler Ranges]] in [[South Australia]]. The [[Mallee Woodlands and Shrublands|Western Australia Mallee shrub]] ecoregion lies to the west, the [[Little Sandy Desert]] to the northwest, the [[Gibson Desert]] and the [[Central Ranges xeric shrublands]] to the north, the [[Tirari Desert|Tirari]] and [[Sturt Stony Desert|Sturt Stony]] deserts to the east, while the [[Nullarbor Plain]] to the south separates it from the [[Southern Ocean]]. Average annual [[rain]]fall is low and irregular, ranging from {{convert|200|to|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. Thunderstorms are relatively common in the Great Victoria Desert, with an average of 15\u201320 thunderstorms per annum. Summer daytime temperatures range from {{convert|32|to|40|C|F}} while in winter, this falls to {{convert|18|to|23|C|F}}.\n\n==Habitation==\nThe majority of people living in the region are [[Indigenous Australians]] from different groups including the [[Kogara]], the [[Mirning]] and the [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]]. It is the part of Australia with the most populous and most healthy indigenous population.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Aboriginal populations have been increasing in this region.

He named the desert after the then-reigning British monarch, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. In 1891,  David Lindsey's expedition traveled across this area from north to south. [[Frank Hann]] was looking for gold in this area between 1903 and 1908. [[Len Beadell]] explored the area in the 1960s.\n\n==Environment==\n[[File:Serpentine Lakes.JPG|thumb|Serpentine Lakes, South Australia, 2011]]\nThe Great Victoria desert is a [[World Wildlife Fund]] [[ecoregion]]<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa1305|name=Great Victoria desert}}</ref> and an [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia]] (IBRA) region of the same name.<ref name=\"IBRA7\">[http://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/science/ibra IBRA Version 7] data</ref>\n\nAs this area has had very limited use for agriculture, habitats remain largely undisturbed while parts of the desert are protected areas including [[Mamungari Conservation Park]] (formerly known as Unnamed Conservation Park) in South Australia, a large area of pristine arid zone wilderness which possesses cultural significance and is one of the fourteen World [[Biosphere]] [[Biosphere Reserve|Reserves]]<ref>[http://www.environment.gov.au/node/20937 Australia's Biosphere Reserves].

Between the sand ridges there are areas of wooded steppe consisting of ''[[Eucalyptus gongylocarpa]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus youngiana]]'' and mulga ''([[Acacia aneura]])'' shrubs scattered over areas of resilient spinifex grasses particularly ''[[Triodia basedowii]]''.\n\n===Fauna===\nWildlife adapted to these harsh conditions includes few large birds or mammals. However, the desert does sustain many types of lizard including the vulnerable [[great desert skink]] (''Egernia kintorei''), the [[Oxyuranus temporalis|Central Ranges taipan]] (discovered in 2007), and a number of small marsupials including the endangered [[sandhill dunnart]] ''(Sminthopsis psammophila)'' and the [[crest-tailed mulgara]] ''(Dasycercus cristicauda)''. One way to survive here is to burrow into the sands, as a number of the desert's animals, including the [[southern marsupial mole]] ''(Notoryctes typhlops)'', and the [[Litoria platycephala|water-holding frog]] do. Birds include the [[chestnut-breasted whiteface]] (''Aphelocephala pectoralis'') found on the eastern edge of the desert and the [[malleefowl]] of Mamungari Conservation Park. Predators of the desert include the [[dingo]] (as the desert is north of the [[Dingo Fence]]) and two large monitor lizards, the [[perentie]] ''(Varanus giganteus)'' and the [[sand goanna]] ''(Varanus gouldii)''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Australia|Geography}}\n* [[Deserts of Australia]]\n* [[List of deserts by area]]\n* [[Nullarbor Plain]]\n*[[Tallaringa Conservation Park]]\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n* {{Citation | author1=Shephard, Mark | title=The Great Victoria Desert : north of the Nullarbor, south of the centre | publication-date=1995 | publisher=Reed Books | isbn=978-0-7301-0485-8 }}\n* {{Citation | author1=Joseph, Leo | author2=Greenslade, Penelope | author3=Barley, R.

The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate software released under the LGPL into their own (even [[proprietary software|proprietary]]) software without being required by the terms of a strong [[copyleft]] license to release the source code of their own components. The license only requires software under the LGPL be modifiable by end users via source code availability. For proprietary software, code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a [[shared library]], so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components. The LGPL is primarily used for [[Library (computing)|software libraries]], although it is also used by some stand-alone applications.\n\nThe LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong [[copyleft]] of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) and more [[Permissive free software licence|permissive]] licenses such as the [[BSD license]]s and the [[MIT License]]. The word \"Lesser\" in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user's complete freedom in the use of software; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL, but not for any proprietary components.\n\n==History==\nThe license was originally called the '''GNU Library General Public License''' and was first published in 1991, and adopted the version number 2 for parity with GPL version 2. The LGPL was revised in minor ways in the 2.1 point release, published in 1999, when it was renamed the GNU Lesser General Public License to reflect the FSF's position that not all libraries should use it. Version 3 of the LGPL was published in 2007 as a list of additional permissions applied to GPL version 3.\n\n==Differences from the GPL==\nThe main difference between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter allows the work to be linked with (in the case of a library, \"used by\") a non-(L)GPLed program, regardless of whether it is [[free software]] or [[proprietary software]].<ref name=\"not_use_LGPL\">Stallman, Richard. [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html Why you shouldn't use the Lesser GPL for your next library]. [[Free Software Foundation]] official website.</ref> The non-(L)GPLed program can then be distributed under any terms if it is not a [[derivative work]]. If it is a derivative work, then the program's terms must allow for \"modification for the customer's own use and [[reverse engineering]] for debugging such modifications.\" Whether a work that uses an LGPL program is a derivative work or not is a legal issue. A standalone executable that [[Library (computing)#Dynamic linking|dynamically links]] to a library through a [[Library (computing)#Shared libraries|.so]], [[Dynamic-link library|.dll]], or similar medium is generally accepted as not being a derivative work as defined by the LGPL. It would fall under the definition of a \"work that uses the Library\". Paragraph 5 of the LGPL version 2.1 states:\n\n:A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nEssentially, if it is a \"work that uses the library\", then it must be possible for the software to be linked with a newer version of the LGPL-covered program. The most commonly used method for doing so is to use \"a suitable [[Library (computing)#Shared libraries|shared library]] mechanism for linking\". Alternatively, a [[statically linked library]] is allowed if either source code or linkable object files are provided.<ref name=\"LGPL_Section_4\">[https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html#section4 Gnu Lesser General Public License, Section 4], pt. d) 0)</ref>\n\n==Compatibility==\nOne feature of the LGPL is the permission to [[Software relicensing|relicense]] under the GPL any piece of software which is received under the LGPL (see section 3 of the LGPL version 2.1, and section 2 option b of the LGPL version 3). This feature allows for direct reuse of LGPLed code in GPLed libraries and applications.\n\nVersion 3 of the LGPL is not inherently compatible with version 2 of the GPL.  However, works using the latter that have given permission to use a later version of the GPL are compatible:<ref name=\"LGPL_FSF\">[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#LGPL GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 3]. [[Free Software Foundation]] official website.</ref> a work released under the GPLv2 \"or any later version\" may be combined with code from a LGPL version 3 library, with the combined work as a whole falling under the terms of the GPLv3.<ref name=\"LGPL_FSF_MATRIX\">[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#gpl-compat-matrix Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation]. [[Free Software Foundation]] official website.</ref>\n\n==LGPL for libraries==\nThe former name \"GNU Library General Public License\" gave some the impression that the FSF recommended software libraries use the LGPL and that programs use the GPL. In February 1999, GNU Project leader Richard Stallman wrote the essay ''Why you shouldn't use the Lesser GPL for your next library'' explaining that the LGPL had not been [[deprecation|deprecated]], but that one should not ''necessarily'' use the LGPL for all libraries:\n\n:Which license is best for a given library is a matter of strategy ... Using the ordinary GPL for a library gives free software developers an advantage over proprietary developers: a library that they can use, while proprietary developers cannot use it ... When a free library's features are readily available for proprietary software through other alternative libraries ... the library cannot give free software any particular advantage, so it is better to use the Lesser GPL for that library.<ref name=\"not_use_LGPL\" />\n\nStallman and the FSF sometimes advocate licenses even less restrictive than the LGPL as a matter of strategy. A prominent{{cn|date=October 2018}} example was Stallman's endorsement of the use of a [[BSD license|BSD-style]] license by the [[Vorbis]] project for use in its libraries.<ref name=\"Vorbis_and_BSD\">Stallman, Richard. [https://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/rms-ov-license.php3 <nowiki>Re: [open-source] [Fwd: [icecast-dev] Xiph.org announces Vorbis Beta 4 and the Xiph.org</nowiki>]</ref>\n\n==Programming language specifications==\nThe license uses terminology which is mainly intended for applications written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] or its family. Franz Inc. published its own preamble to the license to clarify terminology in the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] context. LGPL with this preamble is sometimes referred as LLGPL.<ref name=\"LGPL_preamble\">[http://opensource.franz.com/preamble.html Preamble to the Gnu Lesser General Public License]</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] has a special feature, [[wikibooks:Ada Programming/Generics|generics]], which may prompt the use of [[GNAT Modified General Public License]]: it allows code to link against or instantiate GMGPL-covered units without the code itself becoming covered by the GPL.\n\n[[C++]] templates and [[Header-only|header-only libraries]] have the same problem as Ada generics. Version 3 of the LGPL addresses such cases in section 3.<ref>[https://listengine.tuxfamily.org/lists.tuxfamily.org/eigen/2008/02/msg00003.html LGPLv3 for a C++ Pure Template Library ?]</ref>\n\n===Class inheritance===\nSome concern has risen about the suitability of object-oriented classes in LGPL'd being [[Inheritance (computer science)|inherited]] by non-(L)GPL code. Clarification is given on the official GNU website:\n\n:The LGPL does not  contain special provisions for inheritance, because none are needed. Inheritance creates derivative works in the same way as traditional linking, and the LGPL permits this type of derivative work in the same way as it permits ordinary function calls.<ref>Turner, David.

He served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Blair ministry|Blair Government]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] to [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2007|2007]]. Brown was a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) from [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] to [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015]], first for [[Dunfermline East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline East]] and later for [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath]].\n\nA doctoral graduate of the [[University of Edinburgh]], Brown spent his early career working as both a lecturer at a [[further education]] college and a television journalist.

He joined the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] in 1989 as [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|Shadow Secretary of State for Trade]], and was later promoted to become [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1992. After Labour's victory in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]], he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, becoming the longest-serving holder of that office in modern history.\n\nBrown's time as Chancellor was marked by major reform of Britain's monetary and fiscal policy architecture, transferring interest rate setting powers to the [[Bank of England]], by a wide extension of the powers of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] to cover much domestic policy and by transferring responsibility for banking supervision to the [[Financial Services Authority]].

The mission was further delayed by the hiatus in launches that occurred after the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]]. New safety protocols introduced as a result of the disaster prohibited the use of the Centaur-G stage on the Shuttle, forcing ''Galileo'' to use a lower-powered [[Inertial Upper Stage]] solid-fuel booster. The mission was re-profiled in 1987 to use several [[gravitational slingshot]]s, referred to as the Venus-Earth-Earth Gravity Assist or VEEGA maneuvers, to provide the additional velocity required to reach its destination.

NASA. Retrieved April 24, 2012.</ref>\n\n''Galileo''{{'s}} prime mission was a two-year study of the Jovian system. The spacecraft traveled around Jupiter in elongated [[ellipse]]s, each orbit lasting about two months. The differing distances from Jupiter afforded by these orbits allowed ''Galileo'' to sample different parts of the planet's extensive [[magnetosphere]]. The orbits were designed for close-up flybys of Jupiter's largest moons. Once the prime mission concluded, an extended mission started on December 7, 1997; the spacecraft made several flybys of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Io (moon)|Io]]. The closest approach was {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}} on October 15, 2001. The [[radiation]] environment near Io was very unhealthy for ''Galileo''{{'s}} systems, and so these flybys were saved for the extended mission when loss of the spacecraft would be more acceptable.\n\n''Galileo''{{'s}} cameras were deactivated on January 17, 2002, after they had sustained irreparable radiation damage. NASA engineers were able to recover the damaged tape recorder electronics, and ''Galileo'' continued to return scientific data until it was deorbited in 2003, performing one last scientific experiment: a measurement of the moon [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]]'s mass as the spacecraft swung by it.\n\nOn December 11, 2013, NASA reported, based on results from the ''Galileo'' mission, the detection of \"[[Clay minerals|clay-like minerals]]\" (specifically, [[phyllosilicates]]), often associated with [[organic materials]], on the icy crust of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].<ref name=\"NASA-20131211\">{{cite web |last=Cook |first=Jia-Rui c. |title=Clay-Like Minerals Found on Icy Crust of Europa |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-362 |date=December 11, 2013 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}</ref> The presence of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an [[asteroid]] or [[comet]], according to the scientists.<ref name=\"NASA-20131211\" />\n\n==Spacecraft==\n[[File:Galileo Diagram.jpg|thumb|A diagram of ''Galileo''{{'s}} main components]]\n[[File:Galileo in 1983.jpg|thumb|''Galileo'' with its main antenna open]]\n\nThe [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] built the ''Galileo'' spacecraft and managed the ''Galileo'' mission for NASA.

''Galileo''{{'s}} attitude control system software was written in the [[HAL/S]] programming language,<ref name=tom/> also used in the [[Space Shuttle program]].\n\nMemory capacity provided by each BUM was 16K of [[RAM]], while the DBUMs each provided 8K of RAM. There were two BUMs and two DBUMs in the CDH subsystem and they all resided on the spun side of the spacecraft. The BUMs and DBUMs provided storage for sequences and contain various buffers for telemetry data and interbus communication.\n\nEvery HLM and LLM was built up around a single 1802 microprocessor and 32K of RAM (for HLMs) or 16K of RAM (for LLMs). Two HLMs and two LLMs resided on the spun side while two LLMs were on the despun side.\n\nThus, total memory capacity available to the CDH subsystem was 176K of RAM: 144K allocated to the spun side and 32K to the despun side.\n\nEach HLM was responsible for the following functions:\n#uplink command processing\n#maintenance of the spacecraft clock\n#movement of data over the data system bus\n#execution of stored sequences (time-event tables)\n#telemetry control\n#error recovery including system fault-protection monitoring and response\n\nEach LLM was responsible for the following functions:\n#collect and format engineering data from the subsystems\n#provide the capability to issue coded and discrete commands to spacecraft users\n#recognize out-of-tolerance conditions on status inputs\n#perform some system fault-protection functions\n\nThe HCD received command data from the modulation/demodulation subsystem, decoded these data and transferred them to the HLMs and CRCs.\n\nThe CRC controlled the configuration of CDH subsystem elements. It also controlled access to the two data system buses by other spacecraft subsystems. In addition, the CRC supplied signals to enable certain critical events (e.g. probe separation).\n\nThe GCs provided [[Binary Golay code|Golay]] encoding of data via hardware.\n\nThe TCs and PLLs established timing within the CDH subsystem.\n\n===Propulsion===\n[[File:Galileo propulsion module.jpg|thumb|''Galileo''{{'s}} propulsion module]]\n\nThe propulsion subsystem consisted of a 400&nbsp;[[newton (unit)|N]] main engine and twelve 10&nbsp;N thrusters, together with propellant, storage and pressurizing tanks and associated plumbing. The 10&nbsp;N thrusters were mounted in groups of six on two 2-meter booms. The fuel for the system was {{convert|925|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of [[monomethylhydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]]. Two separate tanks held another {{convert|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of [[helium]] pressurant. The propulsion subsystem was developed and built by [[Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm]] and provided by West Germany, the major international partner in Project ''Galileo''.<ref>[http://www.resa.net/nasa/engineer.htm Engineering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613233904/http://www.resa.net/nasa/engineer.htm |date=June 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Electrical power===\nAt the time, [[solar panel]]s were not practical at Jupiter's distance from the Sun; the spacecraft would have needed a minimum of {{convert|65|m2|sqft|sp=us}} of panels. Chemical batteries would likewise be prohibitively large due to technological limitations. The solution was two [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (RTGs) which powered the spacecraft through the radioactive decay of [[plutonium-238]]. The heat emitted by this decay was converted into electricity through the solid-state [[Seebeck effect]]. This provided a reliable and long-lasting source of electricity unaffected by the cold environment and high-radiation fields in the Jovian system.\n\nEach [[GPHS-RTG]], mounted on a {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=mid|long|sp=us}} boom, carried {{convert|7.8|kg|lb|abbr=off}} of {{chem2|^{238}Pu|auto=yes}}.<ref name=\"RTG\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/messenger/oldmess/RTG.html |title=What's in an RTG? |publisher=.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> Each RTG contained 18 separate heat source modules, and each module encased four pellets of [[plutonium(IV) oxide]], a [[ceramic]] material resistant to fracturing. The modules were designed to survive a range of potential accidents: launch vehicle explosion or fire, re-entry into the atmosphere followed by land or water impact, and post-impact situations. An outer covering of [[graphite]] provided protection against the structural, thermal, and eroding environments of a potential re-entry. Additional graphite components provided impact protection, while [[iridium]] cladding of the fuel cells provided post-impact containment. The RTGs produced about 570&nbsp;watts at launch. The power output initially decreased at the rate of 0.6&nbsp;watts per month and was 493&nbsp;watts when ''Galileo'' arrived at Jupiter.\n\nAs the launch of ''Galileo'' neared, anti-nuclear groups, concerned over what they perceived as an unacceptable risk to the public's safety from ''Galileo''{{'s}} RTGs, sought a court injunction prohibiting ''Galileo''{{'s}} launch. RTGs had been used for years in planetary exploration without mishap: the [[Lincoln Experimental Satellite]]s 8/9, launched by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], had 7% more plutonium on board than ''Galileo'', and the two [[Voyager program|''Voyager'' spacecraft]] each carried 80% as much plutonium as ''Galileo''. Activists remembered the messy crash of the Soviet Union's nuclear-powered [[Kosmos 954]] satellite in Canada in 1978, and the 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' accident]], which did not involve nuclear fuel but raised public awareness about spacecraft failures. In addition, no RTGs had ever done a non-orbital swing past the Earth at close range and high speed, as ''Galileo''{{'s}} Venus-Earth-Earth gravity assist trajectory required it to do. This created a novel mission failure modality that might plausibly have entailed total dispersal of ''Galileo''{{'s}} plutonium in the Earth's atmosphere. Scientist [[Carl Sagan]], for example, a strong supporter of the ''Galileo'' mission, said in 1989 that \"there is nothing absurd about either side of this argument.\"<ref name=\"Sagan\">Sagan, Carl. \"Benefit outweighs risk: Launch ''Galileo'' craft,\" USA Today, Inquiry Page, Tuesday, October 10, 1989 [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/course/Syllabi/97Dartmouth/day-6/sagan.html]</ref>\n\nAfter the ''Challenger'' accident, a study considered additional shielding but rejected it, in part because such a design significantly increased the overall risk of mission failure and only shifted the other risks around. For example, if a failure on orbit had occurred, additional shielding would have significantly increased the consequences of a ground impact.<ref name=\"RTG\"/>\n\n===Instrumentation overview===\n[[File:PIA19048 realistic color Europa mosaic.jpg|thumb|This image of Europa was produced from the Galileo images of the moon]]\nScientific instruments to measure fields and particles were mounted on the spinning section of the spacecraft, together with the main [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], power supply, the propulsion module and most of ''Galileo''{{'s}} computers and control electronics. The sixteen instruments, weighing {{convert|118|kg|lb|abbr=on}} altogether, included [[magnetometer]] sensors mounted on an {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} boom to minimize interference from the spacecraft; a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] instrument for detecting low-energy charged particles and a plasma-wave detector to study waves generated by the particles; a high-energy particle detector; and a detector of cosmic and Jovian [[dust]]. It also carried the Heavy Ion Counter, an engineering experiment to assess the potentially hazardous charged particle environments the spacecraft flew through, and an [[extreme ultraviolet]] detector associated with the UV spectrometer on the scan platform.\n\nThe despun section's instruments included the camera system; the [[near infrared]] mapping spectrometer to make multi-spectral images for atmospheric and moon surface chemical analysis; the ultraviolet spectrometer to study gases; and the photopolarimeter-radiometer to measure radiant and reflected energy. The camera system was designed to obtain images of Jupiter's satellites at resolutions 20 to 1,000 times better than [[Voyager program|''Voyager'']]{{'s}} best, because ''Galileo'' flew closer to the planet and its inner moons, and because the more modern [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] sensor in ''Galileo''{{'s}} camera was more sensitive and had a broader color detection band than the [[vidicon]]s of ''Voyager''.\n\n===Instrumentation details===\nThe following information was taken directly from NASA's ''Galileo'' legacy site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://galileo.jpl.nasa.gov/resources.cfm |title=Solar System Exploration: ''Galileo'' Legacy Site |publisher=Galileo.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Despun section====\n=====Solid State Imager (SSI)=====\n[[Image:Galileo Solid- State Imaging.jpg|thumb|Solid-State Imager]]\nThe SSI was an 800-by-800-pixel solid state camera consisting of an array of silicon sensors called a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD). ''Galileo'' was one of the first spacecraft to be equipped with a CCD camera.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  The optical portion of the camera was built as a [[Cassegrain telescope]]. Light was collected by the primary mirror and directed to a smaller secondary mirror that channeled it through a hole in the center of the primary mirror and onto the CCD. The CCD sensor was shielded from [[radiation]], a particular problem within the harsh Jovian magnetosphere. The shielding was accomplished by means of a {{convert|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick layer of [[tantalum]] surrounding the CCD except where the light enters the system. An eight-position filter wheel was used to obtain images at specific wavelengths. The images were then combined electronically on Earth to produce color images. The spectral response of the SSI ranged from about 0.4 to 1.1&nbsp;micrometers. The SSI weighed {{convert|29.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and consumed, on average, 15 watts of power.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/instruments/ssi.html |title=SSI \u2013 Solid State Imaging |publisher=.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/sepo/ SSI Imaging Team site].</ref>\n\n=====Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS)=====\n[[File:Galileo - NIMS photo - nims1.jpg|thumb|left|Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer]]\nThe NIMS instrument was sensitive to 0.7-to-5.2-[[micrometer]] wavelength [[infrared]] light, overlapping the wavelength range of the SSI. The telescope associated with NIMS was all reflective (using only mirrors and no lenses) with an aperture of {{convert|229|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}. The [[spectrometer]] of NIMS used a grating to disperse the light collected by the telescope. The dispersed spectrum of light was focused on detectors of [[indium]], [[antimonide]] and [[silicon]].

Both the UVS and EUV instruments used a ruled [[grating]] to disperse this light for spectral analysis. This light then passed through an exit slit into [[photomultiplier]] tubes that produced pulses or \"sprays\" of electrons. These electron pulses were counted, and these count numbers constituted the data that were sent to Earth. The UVS was mounted on ''Galileo''{{'s}} scan platform and could be pointed to an object in inertial space. The EUV was mounted on the spun section. As ''Galileo'' rotated, EUV observed a narrow ribbon of space perpendicular to the spin axis. The two instruments combined weighed about {{convert|9.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and used 5.9 watts of power.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/instruments/euv.html |title=EUVS \u2013 Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer |publisher=.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://lasp.colorado.edu/galileo/ EUV Team site].</ref>\n\n=====Photopolarimeter-Radiometer (PPR)=====\nThe PPR had seven radiometry bands. One of these used no filters and observed all incoming radiation, both solar and thermal. Another band allowed only solar radiation through. The difference between the solar-plus-thermal and the solar-only channels gave the total thermal radiation emitted. The PPR also measured in five broadband channels that spanned the spectral range from 17 to 110 micrometers. The radiometer provided data on the temperatures of Jupiter's atmosphere and satellites. The design of the instrument was based on that of an instrument flown on the ''[[Pioneer Venus]]'' spacecraft. A {{convert|100|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} aperture reflecting telescope collected light and directed it to a series of filters, and, from there, measurements were performed by the detectors of the PPR.

The speed of these small particles could be measured over the range of {{convert|1|to|70|km/s|mi/s|1|sp=us}}. The instrument could measure impact rates from 1 particle per 115 days (10 megaseconds) to 100 particles per second.

The EPD could also measure the direction of travel of such particles and, in the case of ions, could determine their composition (whether the ion is [[oxygen]] or [[sulfur]], for example). The EPD used silicon solid-state detectors and a [[time-of-flight]] detector system to measure changes in the energetic particle population at Jupiter as a function of position and time. These measurements helped determine how the particles got their energy and how they were transported through Jupiter's magnetosphere.

The HIC detected heavy [[ion]]s using stacks of single crystal silicon wafers. The HIC could measure heavy ions with energies as low as {{convert|6|MeV|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} and as high as {{convert|200|MeV|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} per nucleon. This range included all atomic substances between [[carbon]] and [[nickel]]. The HIC and the EUV shared a communications link and, therefore, had to share observing time.

The three sensors allowed the three orthogonal components of the [[magnetic field]] section to be measured. One set was located at the end of the magnetometer boom and, in that position, was about {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the spin axis of the spacecraft. The second set, designed to detect stronger fields, was {{convert|6.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the spin axis. The boom was used to remove the MAG from the immediate vicinity of ''Galileo'' to minimize magnetic effects from the spacecraft. However, not all these effects could be eliminated by distancing the instrument. The rotation of the spacecraft was used to separate natural magnetic fields from engineering-induced fields. Another source of potential error in measurement came from the bending and twisting of the long magnetometer boom. To account for these motions, a calibration coil was mounted rigidly on the spacecraft to generate a reference magnetic field during calibrations. The magnetic field at the surface of the Earth has a strength of about 50,000&nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|nT]]. At Jupiter, the outboard (11 m) set of sensors could measure magnetic field strengths in the range from \u00b132 to \u00b1512&nbsp;nT, while the inboard (6.7 m) set was active in the range from \u00b1512 to \u00b116,384&nbsp;nT.

Culled from NASA's press kit, the top orbiter scientific results were:\n\n* ''Galileo'' made the first observation of [[ammonia]] clouds in another planet's atmosphere. The atmosphere creates ammonia ice particles from material coming up from lower depths.\n* The moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] was confirmed to have extensive volcanic activity that is 100 times greater than that found on Earth. The heat and frequency of eruptions are reminiscent of early Earth.\n* Complex plasma interactions in Io's atmosphere create immense electrical currents which couple to Jupiter's atmosphere.\n* Several lines of evidence from ''Galileo'' support the theory that liquid oceans exist under [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]'s icy surface.\n* Ganymede possesses its own, substantial magnetic field \u2013 the first satellite known to have one.\n* ''Galileo'' magnetic data provided evidence that Europa, [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] have a liquid salt water layer under the visible surface.\n* Evidence exists that Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto all have a thin atmospheric layer known as a 'surface-bound [[exosphere]]'.\n* Jupiter's [[ring system]] is formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary [[meteoroid]]s smash into the planet's [[Inner satellites of Jupiter|four small inner moons]]. The outermost ring is actually two rings, one embedded with the other. There is probably a separate ring along [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]]'s orbit, as well.\n* The ''Galileo'' spacecraft identified the global structure and dynamics of a giant planet's [[magnetosphere]].\n\n==Other science conducted by ''Galileo''==\n\n===Remote detection of life on Earth===\n[[File:Galileo Earth - PIA00114.jpg|thumb|left|''Galileo'' image of Earth, taken in December 1990]]\nThe astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], pondering the question of whether life on Earth could be easily detected from space, devised a set of experiments in the late 1980s using ''Galileo''{{'s}} remote sensing instruments during the mission's first Earth flyby in December 1990. After data acquisition and processing, Sagan ''et al.'' published a paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1993 detailing the results of the experiment. ''Galileo'' had indeed found what are now referred to as the \"Sagan criteria for life\". These included strong absorption of light at the red end of the visible spectrum (especially over [[continents]]) which was caused by absorption by chlorophyll in photosynthesizing plants, absorption bands of molecular oxygen which is also a result of plant activity, infrared absorption bands caused by the ~1 micromole per [[mole (unit)|mole]] (\u00b5mol/mol) of methane in Earth's atmosphere (a gas which must be replenished by either volcanic or biological activity), and modulated narrowband radio wave transmissions uncharacteristic of any known natural source.

Optical communications in space was assessed by detecting light pulses from powerful lasers with ''Galileo''{{'s}} [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]. The experiment, dubbed ''Galileo'' Optical Experiment or GOPEX,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lasers.jpl.nasa.gov/PAPERS/GOPEX/gopex_s2.pdf |title=GOPEX SPIE 1993 (Edited) |format=PDF |accessdate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050447/http://lasers.jpl.nasa.gov/PAPERS/GOPEX/gopex_s2.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> used two separate sites to beam laser pulses to the spacecraft, one at [[Table Mountain Observatory]] in California and the other at the [[Starfire Optical Range]] in New Mexico. The Table Mountain site used a [[nonlinear optics|frequency doubled]] [[neodymium]]-[[yttrium]]-[[aluminium]] [[garnet]] ([[Nd:YAG laser|Nd:YAG]]) laser operating at 532&nbsp;nm with a repetition rate of ~15 to 30&nbsp;Hz and a pulse power ([[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]]) in the tens of megawatts range, which was coupled to a {{convert|0.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} Cassegrain telescope for transmission to ''Galileo''. The Starfire range site used a similar setup with a larger, {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, transmitting telescope. Long exposure (~0.1 to 0.8&nbsp;s) images using ''Galileo''{{'s}} 560&nbsp;nm centered green filter produced images of Earth clearly showing the laser pulses even at distances of up to {{convert|6|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}}. Adverse weather conditions, restrictions placed on laser transmissions by the U.S. [[Space Defense Operations Center]] ([[Cheyenne Mountain Complex|SPADOC]]) and a pointing error caused by the scan platform acceleration on the spacecraft being slower than expected (which prevented laser detection on all frames with less than 400&nbsp;ms exposure times) all contributed to the reduction of the number of successful detections of the laser transmission to 48 of the total 159 frames taken. Nonetheless, the experiment was considered a resounding success and the data acquired will likely be used in the future to design laser \"downlinks\" which will send large volumes of data very quickly from spacecraft to Earth. The scheme was already being studied (as of 2004) for a data link to a future Mars orbiting spacecraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_041115.html |title=NASA To Test Laser Communications With Mars Spacecraft |publisher=Space.com |date=November 15, 2004 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Lunar observations===\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:The Moon from Galileo - GPN-2000-000473.jpg|''Galileo'' shot of Earth's Moon\nFile:Moon Crescent - False Color Mosaic.jpg|[[False color]] mosaic by ''Galileo'' showing [[Geology of the Moon|compositional variations]] of the Moon's surface\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Star scanner===\n''Galileo''{{'s}} star scanner was a small optical telescope that provided an absolute attitude reference. It also made several scientific discoveries serendipitously.<ref>[http://www.mindspring.com/~feez/ \"Science with The Galileo Star Scanner\"]. Mindspring.com. Retrieved December 8, 2012.</ref> In the prime mission, it was found that the star scanner was able to detect high-energy particles as a noise signal. This data was eventually calibrated to show the particles were predominantly >{{convert|2|MeV|abbr=on}} electrons that were trapped in the Jovian magnetic belts, and released to the Planetary Data System.\n\nA second discovery occurred in 2000. The star scanner was observing a set of stars which included the second magnitude star [[Delta Velorum]]. At one point, this star dimmed for 8 hours below the star scanner's detection threshold. Subsequent analysis of ''Galileo'' data and work by amateur and professional astronomers showed that Delta Velorum is the brightest known [[eclipsing binary]], brighter at maximum than even [[Algol]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.konkoly.hu/cgi-bin/IBVS?4999 |title=IBVS 4999 (7 December 2000) |publisher=Konkoly.hu |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> It has a primary period of 45 days and the dimming is just visible with the naked eye.\n\nA final discovery occurred during the last two orbits of the mission. When the spacecraft passed the orbit of Jupiter's moon [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]], the star scanner detected unexpected flashes of light that were reflections from moonlets. None of the individual moonlets were reliably sighted twice, hence no orbits were determined and the moonlets did not meet the International Astronomical Union requirements to receive designations.<ref name=IAU_2003/> It is believed that these moonlets most likely are debris ejected from Amalthea and form a tenuous, and perhaps temporary, ring.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2004.01.012 |bibcode=2004Icar..169..390F |title=The Galileo star scanner observations at Amalthea |journal=Icarus |volume=169 |issue=2 |pages=390 |year=2004 |last1=Fieseler |first1=P.

Several pictures of Gaspra were taken, along with measurements using the NIMS instrument to indicate composition and physical properties. The last two images were relayed back to Earth in November 1991 and June 1992. The imagery revealed a cratered and very irregular body, measuring about {{convert|19|by|12|by|11|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}}.

The probe discovered that Ida had a small moon, dubbed Dactyl, measuring around {{convert|1.4|km|mi|sp=us}} in diameter; this was the first [[asteroid moon]] discovered. Measurements using ''Galileo''{{'s}} Solid State Imager, Magnetometer and NIMS instrument were taken. From subsequent analysis of this data, Dactyl appears to be an SII-subtype S-type asteroid, and is spectrally different from 243&nbsp;Ida. It is hypothesized that Dactyl may have been produced by partial melting within a [[Koronis family|Koronis]] parent body, while the 243&nbsp;Ida region escaped such igneous processing.\n\n==Mission challenges==\nSome of the mission challenges that had to be overcome included intense radiation at Jupiter and hardware wear-and-tear, as well as dealing with unexpected technical difficulties.\n\n===Radiation-related anomalies===\n[[File:Jupiter's Magnetosphere animation.png|thumb|Jupiter's inner magnetosphere and radiation belts]]\n\nJupiter's uniquely harsh radiation environment caused over 20 anomalies over the course of ''Galileo''{{'s}} mission, in addition to the incidents expanded upon below. Despite exceeding its radiation design limit by at least a factor of three, the spacecraft survived all these anomalies. Work-arounds were found eventually for all of these problems, and ''Galileo'' was never rendered entirely non-functional by Jupiter's radiation. The radiation limits for ''Galileo''{{'s}} computers were based off data returned from ''[[Pioneer 10|Pioneers 10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11|11]]'', since much of the design work was underway before the two ''Voyagers'' arrived at Jupiter in 1979.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tomayko |first=James |title=Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience |date=1988 |publisher=NASA History Office |pages=200 |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/computers/Ch6-3.html}}</ref>\n\nA typical effect of the radiation was that several of the science instruments suffered increased [[signal-to-noise ratio|noise]] while within about {{convert|700000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of Jupiter. The SSI camera began producing totally white images when the spacecraft was hit by the exceptional [[Bastille Day event|'Bastille Day' coronal mass ejection]] in 2000, and did so again on subsequent close approaches to Jupiter. The quartz crystal used as the frequency reference for the radio suffered permanent frequency shifts with each Jupiter approach. A spin detector failed, and the spacecraft gyro output was biased by the radiation environment.\n\nThe most severe effect of the radiation were current leakages somewhere in the spacecraft's power bus, most likely across [[Brush (electric)|brushes]] at a [[Bearing (mechanical)|spin bearing]] connecting rotor and stator sections of the orbiter. These current leakages triggered a reset of the onboard computer and caused it to go into safe mode. The resets occurred when the spacecraft was either close to Jupiter or in the region of space magnetically downstream of the Earth. A change to the software was made in April 1999 that allowed the onboard computer to detect these resets and autonomously recover, so as to avoid safe mode.<ref>[http://starbase.jpl.nasa.gov/go-a-nims-3-tube-v1.0/go_1117/catalog/insthost.cat~ \"Instrument Host Overview\"].

Only 15 popped out, leaving the antenna looking like a lop-sided, half-open umbrella. Investigators concluded that during the 4.5 years that ''Galileo'' spent in storage after the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|1986 ''Challenger'' disaster]], the [[lubricant]]s between the tips of the ribs and the cup were eroded and worn away from [[vibration]] during three cross-country journeys by truck between California and Florida for the spacecraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/galileo/030921galileohistory.html |title=Spaceflight Now - Galileo - The Galileo trials |publisher=}}</ref> The failed ribs were those closest to the flat-bed trailers carrying ''Galileo'' on these trips, which were used instead of air transport to cut costs.  The antenna lubricants were not checked or replaced before launch.\n\nTo fix this malfunction, engineers tried thermal-cycling the antenna, rotating the spacecraft up to its maximum spin rate of 10.5&nbsp;rpm, and \"hammering\" the antenna deployment motor\u2014turning it on and off repeatedly\u2014over 13,000 times, but all attempts failed to open the high-gain antenna.\n\n[[File:Galileo orbiter arrival at Jupiter (cropped).jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''Galileo'' with antenna not fully deployed]]\n\nThe associated problem mission managers faced was if one rib popped free, there would be increased pressure on the remaining two, and if one of them popped out the last would be under so much pressure it would never release. The second part of the problem was due to ''Galileo''{{'s}} revised flight plan. The probe had never been intended to approach the Sun any closer than the orbit of Earth, but sending it to Venus would expose it to temperatures at least 50 degrees higher than at Earth distance. So the probe had to be protected from that extra heat, part of which involved adapting some of the computer functions. Forty-one [[device driver]]s had been programmed into the computer, but with no room for any more, the mission planners had to decide which driver they could use in association with the heat protection. They chose the antenna motor reverse driver.\n\nFortunately, ''Galileo'' possessed an additional [[low-gain antenna]] that was capable of transmitting information back to Earth, although since it transmitted a signal [[isotropic]]ally, the low-gain antenna's [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] was significantly less than what the high-gain antenna's would have been; the high-gain antenna was to have transmitted at 134&nbsp;[[kilobit]]s per second, whereas the low-gain antenna was only intended to transmit at about 8 to 16&nbsp;bits per second. ''Galileo''{{'s}} low-gain antenna transmitted with a power of about 15 to 20&nbsp;watts, which, by the time it reached Earth and had been collected by one of the large aperture (70 m) [[NASA Deep Space Network]] antennas, had a total power of about \u2212170&nbsp;dBm or 10&nbsp;zeptowatts ({{10^|-20}}&nbsp;watts).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/faqhga.html |title=''Galileo'' FAQ \u2013 ''Galileo''{{'s}} Antennas |publisher=.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> Through the implementation of sophisticated technologies, the arraying of several Deep Space Network antennas and sensitivity upgrades to the receivers used to listen to ''Galileo''{{'s}} signal, data throughput was increased to a maximum of 160&nbsp;bits per second.<ref name=\"parkes.tracks\" /><ref name=DeepSpaceNasaDataRate>{{cite web |url=http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/technology/95_20/gll_case_study.html |title=Advanced Systems Program and the Galileo Mission to Jupiter |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614133445/http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/technology/95_20/gll_case_study.html |archivedate=June 14, 2011}}</ref> By further using data compression, the effective data rate could be raised to 1,000&nbsp;bits per second.<ref name=DeepSpaceNasaDataRate /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftTelemetry.do?id=1989-084B |title=NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - PDMP Details |publisher=}}</ref> The data collected on Jupiter and its moons was stored in the spacecraft's onboard [[tape recorder]], and transmitted back to Earth during the long [[apsis|apoapsis]] portion of the probe's orbit using the low-gain antenna.

In October 1995, ''Galileo''{{'s}} four-track, 114-[[megabyte]] digital tape recorder,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/faqtape.html#capacity |title=''Galileo'' FAQ \u2013 Tape Recorder |publisher=.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> which was manufactured by [[Odetics Corporation]], remained stuck in rewind mode for 15 hours before engineers learned what had happened and sent commands to shut it off. Though the recorder itself was still in working order, the malfunction possibly damaged a length of tape at the end of the reel. This section of tape was subsequently declared \"off limits\" to any future data recording, and was covered with 25 more turns of tape to secure the section and reduce any further stresses, which could tear it. Because it happened only weeks before ''Galileo'' entered orbit around Jupiter, the anomaly prompted engineers to sacrifice data acquisition of almost all of the [[Io (moon)|Io]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] observations during the orbit insertion phase, in order to focus solely on recording data sent from the Jupiter probe descent.\n\n[[File:Parachutes - Galileo Spacecraft - GPN-2000-001911 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Wind tunnel test of the atmospheric probe's parachute]]\n\nIn November 2002, after the completion of the mission's only encounter with Jupiter's moon [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]], problems with playback of the tape recorder again plagued ''Galileo''. About 10 minutes after the closest approach of the Amalthea flyby, ''Galileo'' stopped collecting data, shut down all of its instruments, and went into [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]], apparently as a result of exposure to Jupiter's intense radiation environment. Though most of the Amalthea data was already written to tape, it was found that the recorder refused to respond to commands telling it to play back data. After weeks of troubleshooting of an identical flight spare of the recorder on the ground, it was determined that the cause of the malfunction was a reduction of light output in three infrared Optek OP133 [[light-emitting diode]]s located in the drive electronics of the recorder's motor [[rotary encoder|encoder]] wheel. The [[gallium arsenide|GaAs]] LEDs had been particularly sensitive to proton-irradiation-induced [[crystal|atomic lattice]] displacement defects, which greatly decreased their effective light output and caused the drive motor's electronics to falsely believe the motor encoder wheel was incorrectly positioned. ''Galileo''{{'s}} flight team then began a series of \"[[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]\" sessions, where current was passed through the LEDs for hours at a time to heat them to a point where some of the crystalline lattice defects would be shifted back into place, thus increasing the LED's light output. After about 100 hours of annealing and playback cycles, the recorder was able to operate for up to an hour at a time. After many subsequent playback and cooling cycles, the complete transmission back to Earth of all recorded Amalthea flyby data was successful.\n\n===Probe parachute deployment===\nThe atmospheric probe deployed its parachute fifty-three seconds later than anticipated, resulting in a small loss of upper atmospheric readings. This was attributed to wiring problems with an accelerometer that determined when to begin the parachute deployment sequence.<ref>{{cite book |author=David M.

''Galileo'' had not been sterilized prior to launch and could have carried bacteria from Earth.

In this painting, only the ''action'' that takes place there identifies the setting as distinct from the Garden of the Hesperides, with its golden fruit.\n* The Persian term \"[[paradise]]\" (borrowed as {{lang-he|\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05e1}}, ''pardes''), meaning a royal garden or hunting-park, gradually became a synonym for Eden after c. 500&nbsp;BCE. The word \"''pardes''\" occurs three times in the Hebrew Bible, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the [[Song of Solomon]] iv. 13: \"Thy plants are an orchard (''pardes'') of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard\"; [[Ecclesiastes]] 2. 5: \"I made me gardens and orchards (''pardes''), and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits\"; and in [[Nehemiah]] ii. 8: \"And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's orchard (''pardes''), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city.\" In these examples ''pardes'' clearly means \"orchard\" or \"park\", but in the [[apocalyptic literature]] and in the [[Talmud]] \"paradise\" gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, and in the [[New Testament]] \"paradise\" becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary [[Hellenistic]] influences.\n\n==Other views==\n===Jewish eschatology===\nIn the [[Talmud]] and the Jewish [[Kabbalah]],<ref name=\"Gan Eden\">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=39&letter=E Gan Eden] \u2013 JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.</ref> the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called \"Garden in Eden\". The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the \"lower Gan Eden\". The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the \"higher Gan Eden\".

The idyll of \"Naming Day in Eden\" was less often depicted. Much of [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' occurs in the Garden of Eden.

Diacritics, which can appear above, below, before or after the consonant they belong to, are used to change the inherent vowel.\n* When they appear at the beginning of a syllable, vowels are written as independent letters.\n* When certain consonants occur together, special conjunct symbols are used which combine the essential parts of each letter.\n* Punjabi is a tonal language with three tones. These are indicated in writing using the voiced aspirated consonants (gh, dh, bh, etc.) and the intervocalic h.\n\nThere are two major theories on how the ''Proto-Gurmukh\u012b script'' emerged in the 15th century. G.B. Singh (1950), while quoting [[al-Biruni]]'s ''Ta'rikh al-Hind'' (1030 CE), says that the script evolved from [[Ardhanagari]]. Al-Biruni writes that the Ardhanagari script was used in [[Bathinda]] and western parts of the [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] in the 10th century. For some time, Bathinda remained the capital of the kingdom of [[Bhati]] Rajputs of the Pal clan, who ruled [[North India]] before the Muslims occupied the country. According to al-Biruni, Ardhanagari was a mixture of [[Devanagari]] used in [[Ujjain]] and [[Malwa]] and ''Siddha Matrika'' or the last stage of [[Siddha\u1e43 script]], a variant of the [[\u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script]] used in [[Kashmir]]. This theory is confusing as Gurmukh\u012b characters have a very close resemblance to \"Siddh Matrika\" inscriptions found at several sacred wells in Punjab as Singh notes, one being the Hathur inscription dating to just before the birth of Guru Nanak. Siddh Matrika seems to have been the prevalent script for devotional writings in Punjab right up to the founding of [[Sikhism]], after which its successor Gurmukh\u012b appears.\n\nPritam Singh (1992) has also traced the origins of Gurmukh\u012b to the ''Siddha Matrika''. \"Siddha Matrika\" along with its sister [[Takri alphabet]] has its origins in the \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script of Kashmir.\n\nTarlochan Singh Bedi (1999) writes that the Gurmukh\u012b script developed in the 10-14th centuries from the ''Devasesha'' stage of the \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script, the intermediate phase being Siddha Matrika, before the final evolution into Gurmukh\u012b. His argument is that from the 10th century, regional differences started to appear between the \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script used in Punjab, the Hill States (partly Himachal Pradesh) and Kashmir. The regional \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script evolved from this stage until the [[14th century]], when it starts to appear in the form of Gurmukh\u012b. Indian [[epigraphist]]s call this stage ''Devasesha'', while Bedi prefers the name ''Pritham Gurmukh\u012b'' or Proto-Gurmukh\u012b.\n\nThe [[Sikh gurus]] adopted proto-Gurmukh\u012b to write the Guru Granth Sahib, the religious scriptures of the Sikhs. Other contemporary scripts used in the Punjab were Takri and the [[La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts]]. The Takri alphabet developed through the ''Devasesha'' stage of the \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script and is found mainly in the [[Punjab States Agency|Hill States]] such as [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh]], where it is called ''Chambyali'', and in [[Jammu Division]], where it is known as ''Dogri''. The local Takri variants got the status of official scripts in some of the Punjab Hill States, and were used for both administrative and literary purposes until the 19th century. After 1948, when Himachal Pradesh was established as an administrative unit, the local ''Takri'' variants were replaced by [[Devanagari]].\n\nMeanwhile, the mercantile scripts of Punjab known as the La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts were normally not used for literary purposes. ''Landa'' means alphabet \"without tail\", implying that the script did not have vowel symbols. In Punjab, there were at least ten different scripts classified as La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, [[Mahajani]] being the most popular. The La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts were used for household and trade purposes. Compared to the La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, Sikh Gurus favoured the use of ''Proto-Gurmukh\u012b'', because of the difficulties involved in pronouncing words without vowel signs.\n\nThe usage of Gurmukh\u012b letters in Guru Granth Sahib meant that the script developed its own orthographical rules. In the following epochs, Gurmukh\u012b became the prime script applied for literary writings of the Sikhs. Later in the 20th century, the script was given the authority as the official script of the [[Punjab, India]].<ref name=\"Bright1996p395\"/><ref name=jaincardona53/>\n\n==''Gurmukh\u012b'' Punjabi==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\n[[File:Gurmukhi-poster.gif|thumb|right|Gurmukh\u012b alphabet with names of animals and moves]]\nThe word ''Gurmukh\u012b'' translates as \"from the Mouth of the Guru,\".\n\nGuru Angad is credited in the Sikh tradition with the Gurmukhi script, which is now the standard writing script for Punjabi language in India,<ref name=shacklexvii>{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher |author2=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | isbn = 0-415-26604-1 | pages=xvii\u2013xviii}}</ref> in contrast to Punjabi language in Pakistan where now an Arabic script called [[Nastaliq]] is the standard.<ref name=\"Bright1996p395\"/> The original Sikh scriptures and most of the historic Sikh literature have been written in the Gurmukhi script.<ref name=shacklexvii/>\n\n==Alphabet==\n===Consonants===\n{{IPA notice}}\nThe Gurmukh\u012b alphabet contains thirty-five letters.

It was not a part of the traditional orthography, the phonological difference between 'l' and '\u026d' was not reflected in the script. Some sources do not consider it a separate letter.\n\n====\"Subjoined\" letters====\n\nThree \"subscript\" letters are utilised in Gurmukh\u012b: forms of \u0a39(h), \u0a30(r), and \u0a35(v). \u0a30(r) and \u0a35(v) are used to make consonant clusters and behave similarly; subjoined \u0a39(h) raises tone.\n\n* Subjoined \u0a30(r): For example, the letter \u0a2a(p) with a regular \u0a30(r) following it would yield the word '''\u0a2a\u0a30''' ''p\u0259r'' (\"but\"), but  with a subjoined \u0a30 would appear as '''\u0a2a\u0a4d\u0a30-''' (''pr\u0259-''), resulting in a consonant cluster, as in the word \u0a2a\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a2c\u0a70\u0a27 ('''''pr\u0259'''b\u0259\u0301nd\u032a'', \"management, government\")\n* Subjoined \u0a35(v): somewhat less common in modern usage. For example, \u0a38 followed by a regular \u0a35 would yield '''\u0a38\u0a35'''- (''s\u0259v-'') as in the word \u0a38\u0a35\u0a47\u0a30 (''s\u0259v\u0113r'', \"morning\"), but with a subjoined \u0a35 would produce '''\u0a38\u0a4d\u0a35''' (''sv\u0259-'') as in the word \u0a38\u0a4d\u0a35\u0a30\u0a17 ('''''sv\u0259'''r\u0259g'', \"heaven\")\n* Subjoined \u0a39(h): behaves the same way as the regular \u0a39(h) in non-word-initial positions. The regular \u0a39(h) is pronounced at the beginning of words but not in other positions, where it instead raises the tone. The difference in usage is that the regular \u0a39 is used after vowels and the subscript version when there is no vowel, and is attached to consonants.\n**For example: the regular \u0a39 is used after vowels as in \u0a2e\u0a40\u0a39 (transliterated as ''mih'', to show tonality, '''''m\u012b\u0301''''', \"rain\"). The subjoined \u0a39(h) acts the same way but instead is used under consonants: \u0a1a(ch) followed by \u0a5c(\u1e5b) yields \u0a1a\u0a5c (''ch\u0259\u1e5b''), but not until the rising tone is introduced via a subscript \u0a39(h) does it properly spell the word \u0a1a\u0a5c\u0a4d\u0a39 (''ch\u0259\u0301\u1e5b'', \"climb\").\n\n===Vowels===\n\nGurmukh\u012b is similar to [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]] scripts in that all consonants are followed by an inherent 'a' sound (unless at the end of a word when the 'a' is usually dropped). This inherent vowel sound can be changed by using dependent vowel signs which attach to a bearing consonant. In some cases, dependent vowel signs cannot be used&nbsp;\u2013 at the beginning of a word or syllable for instance&nbsp;\u2013 and so an independent vowel character is used instead.\n\nIndependent vowels are constructed using three bearer characters: Ura (\u0a73), Aira (\u0a05) and Iri (\u0a72).  With the exception of Aira (which represents the vowel 'a') they are never used without additional vowel signs.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Vowel !! colspan=\"2\" | Transcription !! rowspan=\"2\" | IPA || rowspan=\"2\" | Closest English equivalent\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! colspan=\"1\" | Ind.\n! colspan=\"1\" | Dep.\n! colspan=\"1\" | with /k/\n! colspan=\"1\" | Name\n! colspan=\"1\" | [[Punjabi grammar|Usage]]\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a05\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:14px\" align=\"center\" | (none)\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a15\n| Mukt\u0101    || a || {{IPA|[\u0259]}} || like ''a'' in '''''a'''bout''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a06\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a3e\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a15\u0a3e\n| Kann\u0101    || \u0101 || {{IPA|[\u0251]}} , {{IPA|[\u00e4]}}  || like ''a'' in ''c'''a'''r''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a07\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a3f\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a15\u0a3f\n| Sih\u0101r\u012b   || i || {{IPA|[\u026a]}} || like ''i'' in '''''i'''t''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a08\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a40\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a15\u0a40\n| Bih\u0101r\u012b   || \u012b || {{IPA|[i]}} || like ''i'' in ''l'''i'''tre''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\"| \u0a09\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\"| \u0a41\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\"| \u0a15\u0a41\n| Onka\u1e5b    || u || {{IPA|[\u028a]}} || like ''u'' in ''p'''u'''t''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a0a\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a42\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a15\u0a42\n| Dulanka\u1e5b || \u016b || {{IPA|[u]}} || like ''oo'' as in ''f'''oo'''d''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a0f\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a47\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a15\u0a47\n| L\u0101v\u0101\u0303     || \u0113 || {{IPA|[e]}} || like ''e'' in ''Chil'''e'''''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a10\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a48\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a15\u0a48\n| Dul\u0101v\u0101\u0303   || e || {{IPA|[\u025b]}} || like ''e'' in ''s'''e'''ll''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a13\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a4b\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a15\u0a4b\n| H\u014d\u1e5b\u0101     || \u014d || {{IPA|[o]}} || like ''o'' in Spanish ''am'''o'''r''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a14\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a4c\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" align=\"center\" | \u0a15\u0a4c\n| Kan\u014d\u1e5b\u0101   || o || {{IPA|[\u0254]}} || like ''o'' in '''''o'''ff''\n|}\n\nDotted circles represent the bearer consonant.

This means that the subsequent consonant is doubled or reinforced.\n\n====Halant====\n\nThe ''halant''  ( \u0a4d ) character is not used when writing Punjabi in Gurmukh\u012b. However, it may occasionally be used in Sanskritised text or in dictionaries for extra phonetic information. When it is used, it represents the suppression of the inherent vowel.\n\nThe effect of this is shown below:\n\n:\u0a15&nbsp;\u2013 k\u0259\n\n:\u0a15\u0a4d&nbsp;\u2013 k\n\n====Visarg====\n\nThe ''visarg'' symbol (\u0a03 U+0A03) is used very occasionally in Gurmukh\u012b. It can either represent an abbreviation (like period is used in English) or it can act like a [[Sanskrit]] [[Visarga]] where a voiceless 'h' sound is pronounced after the vowel.\n\n====Udaat====\nThe ''udaat'' symbol (\u0a51 U+0A51) occurs in older texts and indicates a high tone.\n\n===Numerals===\n\n{{Main article|Gurmukhi numerals}}\n{{numeral systems}}\n\nGurmukh\u012b has its own set of digits, used exactly as in other versions of the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]]. These are used extensively in older texts. In modern contexts, they have been replaced by standard [[Western Arabic numerals]].\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"1\" | Numeral !!

Founded in 1848, in [[Northwood, Logan County, Ohio|Northwood]], Logan County, [[Ohio]], the college moved to its present location in 1880, where it continues to educate a student body of about 1400 traditional undergraduates in over 30 majors, as well as graduate students in a handful of [[master's]] programs. It is the only [[undergraduate]] institution affiliated with the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America]] (RPCNA).\n\nThe stated mission of the college is \"to glorify God by educating and ministering to a diverse community of students for the purpose of developing servant-leaders, transforming society for the kingdom of Christ.\"<ref>[http://www.geneva.edu/page/mission_statement]</ref> In 1967, the board of trustees adopted the \"Foundational Concepts of Christian Education,\"<ref>[http://www.geneva.edu/page/foundational_concepts]</ref> which continues to guide the institution. The college's undergraduate core curriculum emphasizes the [[humanities]] and the formation of a Reformed Christian worldview.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Northwood Stone.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stone marking the original campus in Northwood]]\n\nGeneva College was founded in 1848 in [[Northwood, Logan County, Ohio|Northwood]], [[Ohio]], by John Black Johnston, a [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] of the RPCNA. The college was founded as \"Geneva Hall\", and was named after the [[Geneva|Swiss center]] of the [[Calvinism|Reformed faith movement]].  After briefly closing during the [[American Civil War]], the college continued operating in Northwood until 1880.  By that time, the college leadership had begun a search for alternate locations that were closer to urban areas.  After considering several locations in the [[Midwest]], the denomination chose the [[College Hill (Beaver Falls)|College Hill]] neighborhood of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania.  The college constructed its current campus on land donated by the [[Harmony Society]]. Old Main, the oldest building on campus, was completed in 1881.\n\nThe Rapp Technical Design Center was completed in 2002.  A major project to reroute [[Pennsylvania Route 18]], which runs through the campus, was completed in November 2007.<ref>[http://www.geneva.edu/object/nr_rt18_opens.html New Route 18 Open], Geneva College, 2007-11-19.  Accessed 2007-11-27.</ref> Improvements to Reeves Stadium and the construction of a campus entrance and pedestrian mall were completed in time for the fall semester in 2009.<ref>[http://www.geneva.edu/object/nr_experience_geneva_8_09.html 'Experience Geneva Night' mentions wrap-up of construction projects], Geneva College. Accessed 2009-08-31.</ref>\n\n===Controversies===\n====CareerLink====\nOn December 15, 2006, the college filed a federal lawsuit against the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]], alleging that a decision by the state to block the college from participating in the state sponsored CareerLink job service amounted to a violation of the college's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights.  In response, the state argued that the college's requirement that faculty and staff members subscribe to the Christian religion amounted to discrimination, to which the college responded that the faculty religious test constituted a [[bona fide occupational qualification]] under existing federal employment law.  The lawsuit was co-sponsored by the [[Association of Faith-Based Organizations]] and argued by the [[Christian Legal Society]].\n\nIn April 2007, the college reached a settlement with CareerLink in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh. Geneva's right to access to CareerLink will be restored and the college will retain the statement on its employment applications stating,  \"Compliance with Geneva's Christian views is considered a bona fide occupational qualification ... and will have a direct impact on employment consideration.\"<ref>[http://www.timesonline.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18278577&BRD=2305&PAG=461&dept_id=478569&rfi=6], Beaver County Times</ref>\n\n====Obamacare====\nIn February 2012, Geneva College President Ken Smith announced a new federal lawsuit against the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration\u2019s]] mandate that religious employers provide abortifacients, sterilization, and contraception to employees regardless of religious or moral objections.<ref>http://www.adfmedia.org/news/prdetail/5342</ref> This mandate, which is part of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and is commonly known as \"Obamacare\", has also been criticized by other religious groups as well as the owners of the retail chain [[Hobby Lobby]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Olafson|first=Steve|title=Hobby Lobby Sues U.S. Government Over Health Care Mandate|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-13/lifestyle/sns-rt-us-usa-health-hobby-lobbybre88c0uc-20120913_1_hobby-lobby-healthcare-mandate-health-mandate|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=September 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Talley|first=Tim|title=Hobby Lobby sues over morning-after pill coverage|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-09-12/hobby-lobby-sues-over-morning-after-pill-coverage|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Route 18 rerouting====\nFor decades, both the college campus and Beaver Falls residents themselves had been wanting [[Pennsylvania Route 18]] re-routed, as the route made a sharp [[s-turn]] through the campus. The s-turn was only 800 feet between the two turns, and while it would obviously cause problems for [[pedestrian]]s (most of whom were students at the campus), it was also a danger for [[semi-trucks]] as well as drivers who would dangerously [[speeding|speed]] around the s-bend.\n\nAfter several years, a deal was finally reached, and [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|PennDOT]] acquired the necessary land via [[eminent domain]] to straighten the road. Homeowners near the campus as well as a local [[car wash]] sold their property to PennDOT for the new right-of-way, which in itself caused controversy. Opponents pointed out how Geneva refused to give up some of its land (most of which at the time was underdeveloped) while at the same time doesn't have to pay taxes to the city.<ref>http://daniel.favand.net/2012/02/03/geneva-college-and-beaver-falls/</ref>\n\n[[Image:BurgerChefBeaverFalls.jpg|thumb|right|265px|The Pizza Dude pizza shop at the southern end of the new right-of-way during construction after agreeing to a compromise with [[PennDOT]] to sell the front half of its property for the new right-of-way.]]\nPennDOT also tried acquiring a local pizza shop, Pizza Dude, for the southern end of the new right-of-way, but the owner didn't want to sell the property since it would potentially lose business from the college students as well as no other suitable property nearby that would adequately replace his old building, a former [[Burger Chef]] location. PennDOT and the owner agreed to a compromise in which the owner got to stay on his property, but had to tear down the front portion of the building (which, for the time being, eliminated seating at the building) so that the right-of-way would have enough clearance from the building. The owner also gave up a portion of his parking lot, but the building itself would be protected by a [[grandfather clause]] requiring a certain length between a road and a building since it was a pre-existing building. In 2010, Pizza Dude moved on its own to downtown Beaver Falls, and the building is currently vacant.\n\nDuring construction, there was also controversy about the unused land between the new roadway and the old one, since Geneva didn't own all of the property. Geneva wanted the state to give the land the college didn't own for free. However, the state refused, but later sold the land (as well as the former Route 18 alignment, which became a [[private access road]] for the university) to Geneva. After construction of the new right-of-way was complete and opened, Geneva shrunk part of the southern end to a one-lane road (in order to make room for the expansion of Reeves Field) and put a [[sidewalk]] in where the northern end used to make the first bend in the s-turn, permanently blocking access to the s-bend. A [[traffic light]] was installed at the intersection along the new alignment with Geneva R.P. Church, requiring students to cross the street at the light.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://businessjournaldaily.com/geneva-college-grows-beyond-bend-2008-1-22 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130727175038/http://businessjournaldaily.com/geneva-college-grows-beyond-bend-2008-1-22 |archivedate=2013-07-27 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Presidents===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* John Black Johnston (1848\u20131850)   \n* William Finney George (1850\u20131852)   \n* James Renwick Willson Sloane (1852\u20131856)   \n* Calvin Knox Milligan (1856\u20131858)\n* John Calvin Smith (1858\u20131860)\n* Nathan Robinson Johnston (1865\u20131867)\n* Samuel John Crowe (1867\u20131871)\n* William Milroy (1871\u20131872)\n* Henry Hosick George (1872\u20131890)\n* William Pollock Johnston (1890\u20131907)\n* William Henry George (1907\u20131916)\n* Renwick Harper Martin (1916\u20131920)\n* Archibald Anderson Johnston (1920\u20131923)\n* McLeod Milligan Pearce (1923\u20131948)\n* Charles Marston Lee (1948\u20131956)   \n* Edwin Cameron Clarke (1956\u20131980)   \n* Donald William Felker (1980\u20131983)   \n* Edwin Cameron Clarke (1983\u20131984)    \n* William Joseph McFarland (1984\u20131992)   \n* John H.

Both Boards drafted the philosophical basis on which the college rests, known as the Foundational Concepts of Higher Education.<ref>[http://www.geneva.edu/page/foundational_concepts Geneva College \u2014 Foundational Concepts], Geneva College.

Virginia Beach: The Donning Company {{ISBN|978-1-57864-006-5}}</ref>  Geneva commemorates this event through the athletic slogan of \"The Birthplace of College Basketball\". Geneva also has one of the oldest basketball courts in collegiate sports in the Johnson Gymnasium.\n\nGeneva was founded by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] immigrants.  Many names of campus buildings and areas bear Scottish names:\n*The main meeting area of the Student Center is called ''Skye Lounge'' after the [[Isle of Skye]].\n*The restaurant-style eating area is called ''The Brig'', short for [[Brigadoon]], commemorating a play about a mythical [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] village.\n\nGeneva sports teams were nicknamed the ''Covenanters'' until the 1950s.  Members of the RPCNA are sometimes referred to as Covenanters because the denomination traces its roots to the [[Covenanter|Covenanting tradition]] of [[Protestant reformation|Reformation era]] [[Scotland]].  The modern sports nickname of ''Golden Tornadoes'' commemorates the \"Golden Tornado\" of May 11, 1914 when a major [[tornado]] struck the college, most notably taking the gold colored roof from the top of Old Main, which was the origin of the associated color. Although the storm caused significant damage to the campus, there were no serious injuries.  College students and faculty rejoiced at what they believed was a sign of God's mercy.\n\nGeneva's traditional sports rivalry is with [[Westminster College, Pennsylvania|Westminster College]] in nearby [[New Wilmington, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fight Breaks Out At D-III Rivalry Game After Dude Gets Thrown To The Deck|url=https://deadspin.com/fight-breaks-out-at-d-iii-rivalry-game-after-dude-gets-1792419077|website=Deadspin|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==People==\n\n===Notable alumni===\n\n*[[Simeon Djankov]], Notable economist and Bulgarian Minister of Finance\n*[[Norman Clyde]], Naturalist and mountaineer \n*[[Caleb Stegall]], Kansas Supreme Court judge\n*[[Josie Badger]], Ms Wheelchair America in 2011\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Offices and classrooms===\n[[File:GC Alexander Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander Hall (street level entrance)]]\n[[File:McCartney Library.jpg|thumb|right|McCartney Library]]\n[[File:Old Main Geneva College.JPG|thumb|right|Old Main (West Entrance)]]\n[[File:Johnston Gym 07.JPG|thumb|right|Johnston Gym]]\n\n*Alexander Hall \u2014 Admissions, financial aid, alumni relations, institutional advancement, and public relations offices (first floor) and main dining hall (second floor).<ref>[http://www.geneva.edu/object/map_alexander Alexander Hall], Geneva College.

It is otherwise identical to Microsoft/[[IBM BASICA]], but is a fully self-contained executable and does not need the [[read-only memory|ROM]] BASIC. It was bundled with [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]]s on [[IBM PC compatible]]s by Microsoft. Microsoft also sold a BASIC [[compiler]], BASCOM, compatible with GW-BASIC, for programs needing more speed. The language is suitable for simple games, business programs and the like. Since it was included with most versions of MS-DOS, it was also a low-cost way for many aspiring [[programmer]]s to learn the fundamentals of [[computer programming]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/KindlyRat/GWBASIC.html|title=GW-BASIC|date=|accessdate=2009-11-10|author=\"KindlyRat\"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050726081451/http://www.geocities.com/KindlyRat/GWBASIC.html\n|archivedate=2005-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://peyre.sqweebs.com/GWBASIC/index.htm|title=GWBASIC Games & Other Programs|date=|accessdate=2009-11-10|author=\"Leon\"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026133328/http://peyre.sqweebs.com/GWBASIC/index.htm |archivedate=2009-10-26}}</ref> With the release of MS-DOS 5.0, GW-BASIC's place was eventually taken by [[QBasic]], the interpreter part of the separately available [[QuickBASIC]] compiler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emsps.com/oldtools/msbasv.htm#qbasic|title=Microsoft BASIC version information|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\nIBM BASICA and GW-BASIC were largely ports of [[MBASIC]] version 5.x, but with added features specifically for the IBM PC hardware. Common features of BASIC-80 5.x and BASICA/GW-BASIC include:\n\n*WHILE...WEND loops\n*40 character variable names\n*OPTION BASE statement to set the starting index of array variables as either 0 or 1\n*Dynamic string space allocation\n*LINE INPUT statement for reading in data from the keyboard\n*CALL statement for executing machine language routines\n*CHAIN and MERGE commands\n*Ability to save programs in either tokenized binary format or ASCII text\n\nThe ability to \"crunch\" program lines by omitting spaces, a common feature of earlier Microsoft BASIC implementations, was removed from BASIC-80 5.x and BASICA/GWBASIC.\n\nBASIC-80 programs not using PEEK/POKE statements would run under GW-BASIC. BASICA added a large number of features for the IBM PC such as sound, graphics, and memory commands. A few other features not present in BASIC-80 included the ability to execute the RND function with no parameters and the ability to also save programs in a \"protected\" format which prevented them from being LISTed. BASICA also allowed double-precision numbers to be used with mathematical and trigonometric functions such as COS, SIN, and ATN, which wasn't allowed in 8-bit versions of BASIC. This feature was normally not enabled and required the optional parameter /D at start up (ie. GWBASIC /D). BASIC's memory footprint was slightly increased if it was used.\n\nMicrosoft did not offer a generic version of MS-DOS until v3.20 in 1986; before then, all variants of the OS were OEM ones. Depending on the OEM, BASIC was distributed as either BASICA.EXE or GWBASIC.EXE. The former should not be confused with IBM BASICA, which always came as a .[[COM file]]. Some variants of BASIC had extra features to support a particular machine (for example, the AT&T and Tandy versions of DOS included a special GW-BASIC that supported their enhanced sound and graphics capabilities).\n\nThe initial version of GW-BASIC was the one included with Compaq DOS 1.13 (released with the Compaq Portable in 1983) and was analogous to IBM BASICA 1.10. It used the CP/M-derived file control blocks for disk access and did not support subdirectories. Later versions added this feature and improved graphics and other capabilities.\n\nGW-BASIC 3.20 (1986) added EGA graphics support (no version of BASICA or GW-BASIC had VGA support) and was in effect the last new version released before it was superseded by [[QBasic]].\n\nBuyers of [[Hercules Graphics Card]]s received a special version of GW-BASIC on the card's utility disk that was called HBASIC and which added support for its 720\u00d7348 monochrome graphics (other versions of BASICA/GW-BASIC did not support Hercules graphics and could only display graphics on that card through the use of third-party [[Color Graphics Adaptor|CGA]] emulation, such as SIMCGA).\n\nGW-BASIC has a [[command line]]-based [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) based on [[Dartmouth BASIC]]. Using the cursor movement keys, any line displayed on screen can be edited. It also includes [[function key]] shortcuts at the bottom of the screen. Like other early [[microcomputer]] versions of BASIC, GW-BASIC lacked many of the structures needed for [[structured programming]] such as local variables, and GW-BASIC programs executed relatively slowly, because it was an [[interpreted programming language]]. All program lines must be numbered; all non-numbered lines are considered to be commands in [[direct mode]] to be executed immediately. Program source files are normally saved in binary compressed format with [[token (parser)|token]]s replacing commands, with an option to save in [[ASCII]] text form.<ref name=\"DocUtil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~hwiegman/gwbasic.html |title=GW-BASIC Documentation and Utilities |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217161146/http://www.xs4all.nl/~hwiegman/gwbasic.html |archivedate = 2007-12-17}}</ref>\n\nThe GW-BASIC command-line environment has commands to <code>RUN, LOAD, SAVE, LIST</code> the current program, or quit to the operating <code>SYSTEM</code>; these commands can also be used as program statements. There is little support for [[structured programming]] in GW-BASIC. All <code>IF/THEN/ELSE</code> [[conditional (programming)|conditional statements]] must be written on one line, although <code>WHILE/WEND</code> statements may group multiple lines. [[subroutine|Functions]] can only be defined using the single line <code>[[User-defined function#BASIC language|DEF FN]]f(x)=<mathematical function of x></code> statement (e.g., <code>DEF FNLOG(base,number)=LOG(number)/LOG(base)</code>). The data type of [[variable (programming)|variable]]s can be specified with a character at the end of the variable name: <code>A$</code> is a [[string (computer science)|string]] of characters, <code>A%</code> is an [[integer]], etc. Groups of variables can also be set to default types based on the initial letter of their name by use of the <code>DEFINT, DEFSTR</code>, etc., statements. The default type for undeclared variables not identified by such typing statements, is single-precision [[floating point]] ([[32-bit MBF]]).<ref name=\"Guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~hwiegman/gw-man/index.html|title=GW-BASIC User's Guide|year=1987|accessdate=2008-06-28|author=}}</ref>\n\nGW-BASIC allowed use of [[joystick]] and [[light pen]] input devices. GW-BASIC can read from and write to files and [[serial port|COM port]]s; it can also do event trapping for ports. Since the [[compact cassette|cassette]] port interface of the original IBM PC was never implemented on compatibles, cassette operations are not supported. GW-BASIC can play simple music using the <code>PLAY</code> statement, needing a string of notes represented in a [[music macro language]] (e.g. <code>PLAY \"edcdeeL2edfedL4c\"</code>). More [[low-level]] control is possible with the <code>SOUND</code> statement, which takes the arguments of a [[frequency]] in [[hertz]] and a length in clock ticks for the standard internal [[PC speaker]] in IBM machines. Consequently, sound is limited to single channel beeps and whistles as befits a 'business' machine. Home-based PCs such as the [[Tandy 1000]] allowed up to three channels of sound for the <code>SOUND</code> and <code>PLAY</code> commands.<ref name=\"Guide\"/>\n\n== Name ==\nThere are several theories on what the initials \"GW\" stand for.

Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray in color, depending on their [[mineralogy]]. The word \"granite\" comes from the [[Latin]] ''granum'', a grain, in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a [[holocrystalline]] rock. Strictly speaking, granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% [[quartz]] by volume, and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of [[alkali feldspar]], although commonly the term \"granite\" is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar. \n\nThe term \"granitic\" means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin. These rocks mainly consist of [[feldspar]], [[quartz]], [[mica]], and [[amphibole]] [[mineral]]s, which form an interlocking, somewhat [[equigranular]] [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]] of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker [[biotite]] mica and amphibole (often [[hornblende]]) peppering the lighter color minerals. Occasionally some individual crystals ([[phenocryst]]s) are larger than the [[groundmass]], in which case the texture is known as [[porphyritic]]. A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]. [[Granitoid]] is a general, descriptive [[Field research|field]] term for lighter-colored, coarse-grained igneous rocks. [[Petrography|Petrographic]] examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geology.about.com/od/more_igrocks/a/granitoids.htm |title=Granitoids \u2013 Granite and the Related Rocks Granodiorite, Diorite and Tonalite |publisher=Geology.about.com |date=2010-02-06 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}</ref> The [[extrusive]] igneous rock equivalent of granite is [[rhyolite]].<ref name=\"Haldar2014\">{{cite book | title=Introduction to Mineralogy and Petrology | publisher=Elsevier |author1=Haldar, S.K.  |author2=Ti\u0161ljar, J. | year=2014 | page=116 | isbn=978-0-12-408133-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Granite under Polarized light.jpg|thumb|A microscopic picture of granite]]\nGranite is nearly always massive (lacking any internal structures), hard and tough, and therefore it has gained widespread use throughout human history as a construction stone.

True granite (according to modern [[petrology|petrologic]] convention) contains both plagioclase and alkali feldspars. When a granitoid is devoid or nearly devoid of plagioclase, the rock is referred to as [[alkali feldspar granite]]. When a granitoid contains less than 10% orthoclase, it is called [[tonalite]]; [[pyroxene]] and [[amphibole]] are common in tonalite. A granite containing both muscovite and biotite [[mica]]s is called a binary or ''two-mica'' granite.

[[Outcrop]]s of granite tend to form [[tor (rock formation)|tors]] and rounded [[massif]]s. Granites sometimes occur in circular [[depression (geology)|depression]]s surrounded by a range of hills, formed by the [[metamorphic aureole]] or [[hornfels]]. Granite often occurs as relatively small, less than 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> stock masses ([[stock (geology)|stocks]]) and in [[batholith]]s that are often associated with [[orogeny|orogenic]] [[mountain]] ranges. Small [[dike (geology)|dikes]] of granitic composition called [[aplite]]s are often associated with the margins of granitic [[intrusion (geology)|intrusion]]s. In some locations, very coarse-grained [[pegmatite]] masses occur with granite.\n\n==Origin==\nGranite has a felsic composition and is more common in continental crust than in oceanic crust. They are crystallized from felsic melts which are less dense than mafic rocks and thus tend to ascend toward the surface. In contrast, mafic rocks, either basalts or gabbros, once metamorphosed at eclogite facies, tend to sink into the mantle beneath the Moho. \n\n===Petrogenetic mechanism===\nGranitoids have crystallized from felsic magmas that have compositions at or near a eutectic point (or a temperature minimum on a cotectic curve). Magmas are composed of melts and minerals in variable abundances. Traditionally, magmatic minerals are crystallized from the melts that have completely separated from their parental rocks and thus are highly evolved because of igneous differentiation. If a granite has a slowly cooling process, it has the potential to form larger crystals. \n\nThere are also peritectic and residual minerals in granitic magmas. Peritectic minerals are generated through peritectic reactions, whereas residual minerals are inherited from parental rocks. In either case, magmas will evolve to the eutectic for crystallization upon cooling. Anatectic melts are also produced by peritectic reactions, but they are much less evolved than magmatic melts because they have not separated from their parental rocks. Nevertheless, the composition of anatectic melts may change toward the magmatic melts through high-degree fractional crystallization. \n\nFractional crystallisation serves to reduce a melt in iron, magnesium, titanium, calcium and sodium, and enrich the melt in potassium and silicon \u2013 alkali feldspar (rich in potassium) and quartz (SiO2), are two of the defining constituents of granite. This process operates regardless of the origin of parental magmas to granites, and regardless of their chemistry.\n\n===Alphabet classification system===\nThe composition and origin of any magma that differentiates into granite leave certain petrological evidence as to what the granite\u2019s parental rock was. The final texture and composition composition of a granite are generally distinctive as to its parental rock. For instance, a granite that is derived from partial melting of metasedimentary rocks may have more alkali feldspar, whereas a granite derived from partial melting of metaigneous rocks may be richer in plagioclase. It is on this basis that the modern \"alphabet\" classification schemes are based. \n\nThe letter-based Chappell & White classification system was proposed initially to divide granites into I-type (igneous source) granite and S-type (sedimentary sources).<ref>Chappell, B. W.; White, A. J. R. (2001). Two contrasting granite types: 25 years later. Australian Journal of Earth Sciences, 48: 489\u2013499. </ref> Both types are produced by partial melting of crustal rocks, either metaigneous rocks or metasedimentary rocks. \n\nM-type granite was later proposed to cover those granites that were clearly sourced from crystallized mafic magmas, generally sourced from the mantle. However, this proposal has been rejected by studies of experimental petrology, which demonstrate that partial melting of mantle periditite cannot produce granitic melts in any case. Although the fractional crystallisation of basaltic melts can yield small amounts of granites, such granites must occur together with large amounts of basaltic rocks. \n\nA-type granites were defined as to occur in anorogenic seeting, have alkaline and anhydrous compositions. They show a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry, with particularly high silicon and potassium at the expense of calcium and magnesium.<ref>Winter, J.D. (2010) Principles of Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology. 2nd Edition, page 381. </ref> These granites are produced by partial melting of refractory lithology such as granulites in the lower continental crust at high thermal gradients. This leads to significant extraction of hydrous felsic melts from granulite-facies resitites. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone Caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite. \n\nH-type granites were suggested for hybrid granites, which were hypothesized to form by mixing between mafic and felsic from different sources, e.g. M-type and S-type. However, the big difference in rheology between magic and felsic magmas makes this process hardly happening in nature.\n\n===Granitization===\nAn old, and largely discounted process, granitization states that granite is formed in place through extreme metasomatism by fluids bringing in elements, e.g. potassium, and removing others, e.g. calcium, to transform a metamorphic rock into a granite. This was supposed to occur across a migrating front. \n\nAfter more than 50 years of studies, it becomes clear that granitic magmas have separated from their sources and experienced fractional crystallization during their ascent toward the surface. On the other hand, granitic melts can be produced in place through the partial melting of metamorphic rocks by extracting melt-mobile elements such as potassium and silicon into the melts but leaving others such as calcium and iron in granulite residues. Once a metamorphic rock is melted, it becomes a kind of migmatites which are composed of leucosome and melanosome. \n\nIn nature, metamorphic rocks may undergo partial melting to transform into migmatites through peritectic reactions, with anatectic melts to crystallize as leucosomes. As soon as the anatectic melts have separated from their sources and highly evolved through fractional crystallization during their ascent toward the surface, they become the magmatic melts and minerals of granitic composition.\n\nAfter the extraction of anatectic melts, the migmatites become a kind of granulites. In all cases, the partial melting of solid rocks requires high temperatures, and also water or other volatiles which act as a catalyst by lowering the solidus temperature of these rocks. The production of granite at crustal depths requires high heat flow, which cannot be provided by heat production elements in the crust. Furthermore, high heat flow is necessary to produce granulite facies metamorphic rocks in orogens, indicating extreme metamorphism at high thermal gradients. In-situ granitisation by the extreme metamorphism is possible if crustal rocks would be heated by the asthenospheric mantle in rifting orogens, where collision-thickened orogenic lithosphere is thinned at first and then underwent extensional tectonism for active rifting.<ref>Zheng, Y.-F., Chen, R.-X., 2017. Regional metamorphism at extreme conditions: Implications for orogeny at convergent plate margins. Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, 145: 46-73.</ref>\n\n==Ascent and emplacement==\nThe ascent and emplacement of large volumes of granite within the upper continental crust is a source of much debate amongst geologists. There is a lack of field evidence for any proposed mechanisms, so hypotheses are predominantly based upon experimental data. There are two major hypotheses for the ascent of magma through the crust:\n\n*Stokes [[diapir]]\n*[[Fracture (geology)|Fracture propagation]]\n\nOf these two mechanisms, Stokes diapir was favoured for many years in the absence of a reasonable alternative. The basic idea is that magma will rise through the crust as a single mass through [[buoyancy]]. As it rises, it heats the [[Country rock (geology)|wall rocks]], causing them to behave as a [[power-law fluid]] and thus flow around the [[pluton]] allowing it to pass rapidly and without major heat loss.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/93JB03461| title = Diapiric ascent of magmas through power law crust and mantle| journal = Journal of Geophysical Research| volume = 99| page = 9543| year = 1994| last1 = Weinberg | first1 = R.

Rocks there do not deform so easily: for magma to rise as a pluton it would expend far too much energy in heating wall rocks, thus cooling and solidifying before reaching higher levels within the crust.\n\n[[Fracture (geology)|Fracture]] propagation is the mechanism preferred by many geologists as it largely eliminates the major problems of moving a huge mass of magma through cold brittle crust. Magma rises instead in small channels along self-propagating [[Dike (geology)|dykes]] which form along new or pre-existing fracture or [[fault (geology)|fault]] systems and networks of active shear zones.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Observations on the origins and ascent mechanisms of granitic magmas|journal=Journal of the Geological Society of London|year=1998|first=John|last=Clemens|volume=155|issue=Part 5|pages=843\u201351 | doi = 10.1144/gsjgs.155.5.0843 |url=http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/2904/|bibcode=1998JGSoc.155..843C}}</ref> As these narrow conduits open, the first magma to enter solidifies and provides a form of insulation for later magma.\n\nGranitic magma must make room for itself or be intruded into other rocks in order to form an intrusion, and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how large [[batholith]]s have been emplaced:\n* [[Stoping (geology)|Stoping]], where the granite cracks the wall rocks and pushes upwards as it removes blocks of the overlying crust\n* Assimilation, where the granite melts its way up into the crust and removes overlying material in this way\n* Inflation, where the granite body inflates under pressure and is injected into position\n\nMost geologists today accept that a combination of these phenomena can be used to explain granite intrusions, and that not all granites can be explained entirely by one or another mechanism.\n\n==Weathering==\n{{further|Weathering}}\n[[File:GrusSand.JPG|thumb|[[Grus (geology)|Grus]] sand and granitoid it derived from]]\n[[Physical weathering]] occurs on a large scale in the form of [[exfoliation joint]]s, which are the result of granite's expanding and fracturing as pressure is relieved when overlying material is removed by erosion or other processes.\n\n[[Chemical weathering]] of granite occurs when dilute [[carbonic acid]], and other acids present in rain and soil waters, [[mineral alteration|alter]] feldspar in a process called [[weathering|hydrolysis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/citycemetery/weathering/granite |title= Granite [Weathering] |work=[[University College London]] |accessdate=10 July 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/ks3/gsl/education/resources/rockcycle/page3566.html |title= Hydrolysis |work=[[Geological Society of London]] |accessdate=10 July 2014 }}</ref> As demonstrated in the following reaction, this causes potassium feldspar to form [[kaolinite]], with potassium ions, bicarbonate, and silica in solution as byproducts.

By contrast, more mafic rocks, such as tonalite, [[gabbro]] and [[diorite]], have 1 to 5 ppm uranium, and [[limestone]]s and [[sedimentary]] rocks usually have equally low amounts. Many large granite plutons are sources for [[palaeochannel]]-hosted or roll front [[uranium ore deposits]], where the uranium washes into the [[sediment]]s from the granite uplands and associated, often highly radioactive pegmatites.

Granite became \"an integral part of the Roman language of monumental architecture\".<ref name=a/> The quarrying ceased around the third century AD. Beginning in Late Antiquity the granite was reused, which since at least the early 16th century became known as [[spoliation]]. Through the process of [[Case hardening of rocks|case-hardening]], granite becomes harder with age. The technology required to make [[tempered steel]] chisels was largely forgotten during the Middle Ages. As a result, Medieval stoneworkers were forced to use saws or emery to shorten ancient columns or hack them into discs. [[Giorgio Vasari]] noted in the 16th century that granite in quarries was \"far softer and easier to work than after it has lain exposed\" while ancient columns, because of their \"hardness and solidity have nothing to fear from fire or sword, and time itself, that drives everything to ruin, not only has not destroyed them but has not even altered their colour.\"<ref name=a>{{cite journal |last1= Waters|first1= Michael|last2= |first2= |date= 2016|title= Reviving Antiquity with Granite: Spolia and the Development of Roman Renaissance Architecture|journal=Architectural History |volume=59 |issue= |pages=149\u2013179 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/architectural-history/article/reviving-antiquity-with-granite-spolia-and-the-development-of-roman-renaissance-architecture/1465A4861BEEA4ABF33A37E2DF4DBD8B|access-date= }}</ref>\n\n===Modern===\n\n====Sculpture and memorials====\n[[File:various granites.jpg|thumb|Various granites (cut and polished surfaces)]]\n\nIn some areas, granite is used for gravestones and memorials. Granite is a hard stone and requires skill to carve by hand. Until the early 18th century, in the Western world, granite could be carved only by hand tools with generally poor results.\n\nA key breakthrough was the invention of steam-powered cutting and dressing tools by Alexander MacDonald of [[Aberdeen]], inspired by seeing ancient Egyptian granite carvings. In 1832, the first polished tombstone of Aberdeen granite to be erected in an English cemetery was installed at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]. It caused a sensation in the London monumental trade and for some years all polished granite ordered came from MacDonald's.<ref>Friends of West Norwood Cemetery newsletter 71 [http://www.fownc.org/pdf/newsletter73.pdf Alexander MacDonald (1794\u20131860) \u2013 Stonemason],</ref> As a result of the work of sculptor William Leslie, and later Sidney Field, granite memorials became a major status symbol in Victorian Britain. The royal sarcophagus at [[Frogmore#Royal Mausoleum (or 'Frogmore Mausoleum')|Frogmore]] was probably the pinnacle of its work, and at 30 tons one of the largest. It was not until the 1880s that rival machinery and works could compete with the MacDonald works.\n\nModern methods of carving include using computer-controlled rotary bits and [[sandblasting]] over a rubber stencil. Leaving the letters, numbers, and emblems exposed on the stone, the blaster can create virtually any kind of artwork or epitaph.\n\nThe stone known as \"black granite\" is usually [[gabbro]], which has a completely different chemical composition.<ref name=graniteland>{{cite web|title=Black granite and black marble|url=http://www.graniteland.com/stone/color/black|work=Trade Brochure|publisher=Graniteland.com|accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Buildings====\nGranite has been extensively used as a [[dimension stone]] and as flooring tiles in public and commercial buildings and monuments. [[Aberdeen]] in Scotland, which is constructed principally from local granite, is known as \"The Granite City\". Because of its abundance in [[New England]], granite was commonly used to build foundations for homes there. The [[Granite Railway]], America's first railroad, was built to haul granite from the quarries in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], to the [[Neponset River]] in the 1820s.\n\n====Engineering====\n[[Engineers]] have traditionally used polished granite [[surface plate]]s to establish a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of reference, since they are relatively impervious and inflexible. Sandblasted [[concrete]] with a heavy [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] content has an appearance similar to rough granite, and is often used as a substitute when use of real granite is impractical. A most unusual use of granite was as the material of the tracks of the [[Haytor Granite Tramway]], Devon, England, in 1820. Granite block is usually processed into slabs, which can be cut and shaped by a [[cutting center]]. Granite tables are used extensively as bases for optical instruments because of granite's rigidity, high dimensional stability, and excellent vibration characteristics. In military engineering, Finland planted granite boulders along its [[Mannerheim Line]] to block invasion by Russian tanks in the winter war of 1940.\n\n====Other uses====\n[[Curling]] stones are traditionally fashioned of Ailsa Craig granite. The first stones were made in the 1750s, the original source being [[Ailsa Craig]] in [[Scotland]]. Because of the rarity of this granite, the best stones can cost as much as US$1,500. Between 60 and 70 percent of the stones used today are made from Ailsa Craig granite, although the island is now a wildlife reserve and is still used for quarrying under license for Ailsa granite by Kays of Mauchline for curling stones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1027_041027_curling_stones.html |title=National Geographic News&nbsp;\u2014 Puffins Return to Scottish Island Famous for Curling Stones |publisher=National Geographic News|author=Roach, John |date=October 27, 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Rock climbing==\nGranite is one of the rocks most prized by climbers, for its steepness, soundness, crack systems, and friction.

According to Moore's tale, a [[Norwegian colonization of the Americas|Norwegian]] mercenary, Captain Jon Logerquist, founded Gotham City in 1635 and the British later took it over\u2014a story that parallels the founding of New York by the Dutch (as [[New Amsterdam]]) and later takeover by the British.  During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Gotham City was the site of a major battle (paralleling the [[Battle of Long Island|Battle of Brooklyn]] in the American Revolution). This was detailed in [[Rick Veitch]]'s ''Swamp Thing'' #85 featuring [[Tomahawk (comics)|Tomahawk]].

In 1881 they constructed three bridges called the Gates of Gotham, each bearing one of their last names.  Edward Elliot became increasingly jealous of the Wayne family\u2019s popularity and wealth during this time period, a jealousy that would spread to his great-great grandson, Thomas Elliot or Hush.<ref>'''Batman: Gates to Gotham'', May 2011. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nThe occult origins of Gotham are further delved into by [[Peter Milligan]]'s 1990 story arc \"Dark Knight, Dark City\",<ref>{{cite web|author=Burgas, Greg|title=Dark Knight, Dark City|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/13/comics-you-should-own-flashback-batman-452-454/|date=April 13, 2010|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref> which reveals that some of the American [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] are involved in summoning a bat-demon which becomes trapped beneath old \"Gotham Town\", its dark influence spreading as Gotham City evolves. A similar trend is followed in 2005's ''[[Shadowpact]]'' #5 by [[Bill Willingham]], which expands upon Gotham's occult heritage by revealing a being who has slept for 40,000 years beneath the land upon which Gotham City was built. Strega, the being's servant, says that the \"dark and often cursed character\" of the city was influenced by the being who now uses the name \"Doctor Gotham.\"\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], it was defended by an ancestor of the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], fighting for the Union Army, Col. Nathan Cobblepot, in the Legendary Battle of Gotham Heights. In ''[[Gotham Underground]]'' #2 by [[Frank Tieri (comics)|Frank Tieri]], [[Tobias Whale]] claims that 19th century Gotham was run by five rival gangs, until the first \"masks\" appeared, eventually forming a gang of their own. It is not clear whether these were vigilantes or costumed criminals.\n\nIn contemporary times, Batman is considered the protector of Gotham, as he is fiercely protective of his home city. While other [[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|masked vigilantes]] also operate in Gotham City, they do so under Batman's approval since he is considered the best and most knowledgeable crime-fighter in the city.\n\nMany storylines have added more events to Gotham's history, at the same time greatly affecting the city and its people. Perhaps the greatest in effect was a long set of serial storylines, which started with [[Ra's al Ghul]] releasing a debilitating virus called the \"Clench\" during the ''[[Batman: Contagion|Contagion]]'' storyline. As that arc concluded, the city was beginning to recover, only to suffer an earthquake measuring 7.6 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter Scale]] in the 1998 \"[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]\" storyline. This resulted in the federal government cutting Gotham off from the rest of the United States in the 1999 storyline \"[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]\", the city's remaining residents forced to engage in gang warfare, either as active participants or paying for protection from groups ranging from the GCPD to the Penguin, just to stay alive. Eventually, Gotham was rebuilt and returned to the U.S. as part of a campaign mounted by [[Lex Luthor]], who used the positive publicity of his role to make a successful bid for the position of President of the United States.\n\nFor a time, the city faces various complications from gang warfare and escalating vigilante actions, due to such events as Spoiler unintentionally triggering a gang war, the return of [[Jason Todd]] as the Red Hood, and Bruce Wayne's disappearance during the war against [[Darkseid]]. Although Dick Grayson takes on the role of Batman for a time, matters become worse when a complex conspiracy initiated by the [[Cluemaster]] results in multiple villains attacking all areas of Batman's life, ruining the reputation of Wayne Enterprises and seeing Commissioner Gordon framed for causing a mass train accident. After destruction caused by the Joker's latest rampage, new villain Mr Bloom sets out to destroy the city so that a new form can \"grow\" from it, but Bruce Wayne returns as Batman in time to defeat Bloom and reaffirm his role as Batman.\n\n==Atmosphere==\nIn terms of atmosphere, ''Batman'' writer and editor [[Dennis O'Neil]] has said that, figuratively, Batman's Gotham City is akin to \"Manhattan below Fourteenth Street at eleven minutes past midnight on the coldest night in November.\"<ref>O'Neil, Dennis. Afterword. ''Batman: Knightfall, A Novel''. New York: Bantam Books. 1994. 344.</ref> Batman artist [[Neal Adams]] has long believed that Chicago, with its proliferation of mobsters in the 1940s, was the basis for Gotham, commenting, \"Chicago has had a reputation for a certain kind of criminality,\" says Adams, who lives in New York. \"Batman is in this kind of corrupt city and trying to turn it back into a better place. One of the things about Chicago is Chicago has alleys (which are virtually nonexistent in New York). Back alleys, that's where Batman fights all the bad guys.\"<ref name=today>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/25774413#.UzZCF8d4Q9U |title=Dark Knight's kind of town: Gotham City |publisher=MSNBC/Associated Press|date=2008-07-20}}</ref> The statement \"Metropolis is New York in the daytime; Gotham City is New York at night\" has been variously attributed to comics creators [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].<ref name=\"Bopik\">{{cite news |first=Barry |last=Bopik |title=The Big Apple: \"Metropolis is New York by day; Gotham and Metropolis is New York |url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/metropolis_is_new_york_by_day_gotham_city_is_new_york_by_night/|date=2008-03-29 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gotham City Batman Vol 1 615.png|thumbnail|Airships are commonly depicted flying over Gotham City.<ref name=\"Batman' 2011\"/> Art by Jim Lee.]]\nStone [[gargoyle]]s are commonly depicted on the buildings of Gotham City, such as the thirteen gargoyles on Wayne Tower.<ref name=\"Batman' 2011\">''Batman'' vol. 2 #2, December 2011. DC Comics.</ref> Various artists have depicted Batman perched atop gargoyles while keeping watch over Gotham City.<ref name=\"Batman' 2011\"/>\n\nIn designing the award-winning ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', creators [[Bruce Timm]] and [[Eric Radomski]] emulated the Tim Burton films' \"otherworldly timelessness,\" incorporating period features such as black-and-white [[title card]]s, police [[airship]]s (although no such thing existed, Timm has stated that he found it to fit the show's style), and a \"vintage\" color scheme with [[film noir]] flourishes.<ref name=\"LeatherWingsComm\">Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski, audio commentary for \"On Leather Wings\", ''Batman: The Animated Series'', Warner Bros, Volume One box set DVD.</ref> Police airships have since been incorporated into Batman comic books and are a recurring element in Gotham City.<ref name=\"Batman' 2011\"/>\n\nGotham City's atmosphere took on a lighter tone in the comics of the 1950s and part of the 1960s, similar to the tone of ''Batman'' stories of that era. However, by the early 1970s, particularly with Dennis O'Neil becoming a prominent ''Batman'' writer,<ref>''Detective Comics'' #395 (January 1970), ''Batman'' #224 (August 1970), et al.</ref> the tone of the city, along with that of the stories, had become grittier. Significantly, by the 1970s, Gotham's real-life counterpart, New York, had lost much of its 1960s \"Fun City\" luster and was beset by urban problems including public fear of rising crime, a declining economy, police corruption, and municipal financial mismanagement. In most stories since the 70s, the portrayal of Gotham is that of a dark and foreboding metropolis rife with crime, corruption, and a deep-seated sense of [[urban decay]].\n\nDuring his run as a writer, ''Batman'' scribe [[Grant Morrison]] brought about a more optimistic interpretation of Gotham City. As Morrison stated: \"If Gotham was so bloody awful, no one normal would live there and there'd be no one to protect from criminals. If Gotham really was an open sewer of crime and corruption, every story set there would serve to demonstrate the complete and utter failure of Batman's mission, which isn't really the message we want to send, is it? You've got Batman and all his allies as well as Commissioner Gordon and the city still exudes a vile miasma of darkness and death? I can't buy that. It's simply not realistic and flies in the face of in-story logic (and you know I like my comics realistic!) so my artists and I have taken a different tack and we want to show the cool, vibrant side of Gotham, the energy and excitement that would draw people to live and visit there.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Graeme McMillan |url=http://io9.com/5301435/grant-morrison-tells-all-about-batman-and-robin |title=Grant Morrison Tells All About Batman and Robin |publisher=Io9.com |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2011-07-13}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Helsinki Railway station towe&statues.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Art deco and art nouveau buildings, such as the [[Helsinki Central Railway Station]], inspired the look of Gotham in the 1989 film ''Batman''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Travel |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/760478/Helsinki-a-cruisers-guide.html |title=Helsinki: a cruiser's guide |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}</ref>]]\nIn the Batman comics, the person cited as an influential figure in promoting the unique architecture of Gotham City during the 19th century was Judge Solomon Wayne, Bruce Wayne's ancestor. His campaign to reform Gotham came to a head when he met a young architect named Cyrus Pinkney. Wayne commissioned Pinkney to design and to build the first \"Gotham Style\" structures in what became the center of the city's financial district. The \"Gotham Style\" idea of the writers matches parts of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in style and timing. In the storyline of [[Batman: Gothic]], the Gotham Cathedral plays a central role for the story as it is built by Mr. Whisper, the story's antagonist.\n\nIn a 1992 storyline, a man obsessed with Pinkney's architecture blew up several Gotham buildings in order to reveal the Pinkney structures they had hidden; the editorial purpose behind this was to transform the city depicted in the comics to resemble the designs created by [[Anton Furst]] for the 1989 ''Batman'' film.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Grant, Alan | Artist = [[Norm Breyfogle|Breyfogle, Norm]]| Story = The Destroyer Part One: A Tale of Two Cities| Title = [[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]|Issue = 474|date=February 1992| Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic| Writer = Grant, Alan|Penciller = [[Chris Sprouse|Sprouse, Chris]]| Inker = Patterson, Bruce| Copencillers = Anton Furst|Story = The Destroyer Part Two: Solomon|Title = [[Legends of the Dark Knight]]| Issue = 27|date=February 1992| Publisher = DC Comics }}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic| Writer =Grant, Alan| Penciller = [[Jim Aparo|Aparo, Jim]]| Inker = [[Mike DeCarlo|DeCarlo, Mike]]|Story =The Destroyer Part Three| Title = [[Detective Comics]]| Issue = 641|date=February 1992| Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\nAlan Wayne expanded upon his father's ideas and built a bridge to expand the city.

During stories set early in Batman's career (most notably ''[[Batman: Year One]]''), [[Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb]] was depicted as accepting bribes from many people. However, Batman found evidence for [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges, forcing Loeb to resign his position. Later stories depicted subsequent commissioners as also being corruptible, or open to various forms of influence. In other stories, Batman has had to take on crooked cops, either acting in collusion with supervillains, working for the mob, or on their own. Later stories, featuring [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] as the new [[Commissioner]], show the two characters often uniting to purge corruption from the force. Gordon eventually retired, handing the police force over to his replacement, [[Michael Akins|Commissioner Akins]]. Recent stories have returned Gordon to the position of Commissioner, unfortunately to find corruption taking a greater hold since his departure.\n\nCorruption escalates during ''[[Batman Eternal]]'' when Gordon is framed for causing a major train accident and a new commissioner is appointed with ties to the old gangs, but Batman and his allies are eventually able to replace him with their ally [[Jason Bard]], only for Bard to resign when he is revealed to have been working with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] to destroy Batman. During Bruce Wayne's temporary 'retirement' after he was left with amnesia following his last battle with the Joker, the police department even created their own Batman using various donated technology, with Gordon acting as the GCPD's official Batman, but he returned to his old role in the department after the true Batman returned. In the 1966 television series, ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', the Gotham City police force was not a focus of the stories.\n\n===Gotham Underground===\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}\n* '''Unified Crime Family'''\n** '''Black Mask''' - During the events of \"[[Batman: War Games]]\", [[Black Mask (comics)|Roman \"Black Mask\" Sionis]] gains control over all gangs in Gotham City and works with [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Society]] to kill Batman.

Gotham City will be incorporated into the [[Arrowverse]] as part of a 2018 [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline among the shows, which will introduce [[Batwoman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/batwoman-make-arrow-verse-debut-next-crossover-1112799 |title=Batwoman to Make in 'Arrow'-verse Debut in Next Crossover |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |work=Hollywood Reporter |date=May 17, 2018 |accessdate=May 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Animated Films===\n[[File:Gotham Knight Skyline.jpg|thumb|The Gotham City skyline in ''Batman: Gotham Knight'' (2008)]]\n{{Main article|DC Animated Universe}}\nDuring the events of the [[direct-to-video]] film, ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'' (1998), a computer screen displaying [[Barbara Gordon]]'s personal information refers to her location as \"Gotham City, NY\", and also displays her area code as being 212 - a [[Manhattan]] area code.\n\n''[[Batman Beyond]]'' (1999-2001) envisions a Gotham City in 2039, referred to as \"Neo-Gotham\". The 2008 direct-to-DVD film ''Batman: Gotham Knight'' shows Gotham as a large city with many skyscrapers and a bustling population.\n\n===Video games===\nGotham City appears in several video games, including ''[[Batman Begins (video game)|Batman Begins]]'', ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', and ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]''. The city makes another appearance in a video game with ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', where the player can fight in front of and inside of [[Wayne Manor]], on top of a building and in an alley as well. Gotham also appears in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', and it is a playable stage once again in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', where the player can fight in front of Empire Theater and inside the prop room.\n\n====Lego Batman====\n{{main article|Lego Batman}}\nThe city is featured in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'', ''[[LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'' as the main hub world, and ''[[LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]''.\n\n====Batman: Arkham Universe====\n[[File:Gotham City Arkham.jpg|thumb|300px|Gotham City in ''Batman: Arkham Knight'' (2015)]]\n{{main article|Batman: Arkham}}\n''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' (2009) opens with Batman driving [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from Gotham City to [[Arkham Asylum]]. Joker also threatens to detonate bombs across Gotham. In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'' (2011), the slums of Old Gotham City (the northern island) were converted into Arkham City. Inside the prison walls, this part of Gotham contains various landmarks throughout the story, like [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s Iceberg Lounge, the Ace Chemical Plant, the [[Black Mask (comics)|Sionis]] Steel Mill, the Old Gotham City Police Department building, and the Monarch Theatre with the Wayne murder scene in Crime Alley. Most of these locations have major events in the story. In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' (2013), an earlier, younger version of the city can be seen than that of other games in the ''Batman: Arkham'' series. In addition to the northern island, this installment in the series lets players explore a new southern island, connected to the former by the Pioneer's Bridge. The setting of ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' (2015), Central Gotham City, is five-times larger than Old Gotham.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Brady, Matthew and Williams, Dwight.

He was the leading American bridge personality in the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 or 1940s and 1950s, as \"Mr. Bridge\"<ref name=truscott/>{{efn|name=Mr}} \u2013 as [[Ely Culbertson]] had been in the 1930s. Culbertson, Goren, and [[Harold Vanderbilt]] were the three people named when ''[[The Bridge World]]'' inaugurated a bridge \"hall of fame\" in 1964 and they were made founding members of the [[ACBL Hall of Fame]] in 1995.<ref name=HOFtop/><ref name=HOFby/>\n\nAccording to ''New York Times'' bridge columnist [[Alan Truscott]], more than 10 million copies of Goren's books were sold. Among them, ''Point-Count Bidding'' (1949) \"pushed the great mass of bridge players into abandoning Ely Culbertson's clumsy and inaccurate honor-trick method of valuation.\"<ref name=truscott2/>\n\n==Early years==\n\nGoren was born in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania,<ref name=truscott/> to [[Russia]]n [[Jewish]] immigrants.  He earned a law degree at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] in 1923. While he was attending McGill, a girlfriend (or \"a young hostess\")<ref name=truscott/> laughed at his ineptness at the game of bridge, motivating him to immerse himself in a study of existing bridge materials.<ref>Goren and Olsen (1965), p. 10.</ref> (The young hostess laughed in 1922. The game was [[auction bridge]], \"which became [[contract bridge]] later in the decade\".)<ref name=truscott2/>\n\nWhen he graduated, he was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar and he practiced law for 13 years in Philadelphia.<ref name=truscott/> The growing fame of [[Ely Culbertson]], however, prompted Goren to abandon his original career choice to pursue bridge competitions, where he attracted the attention of [[Milton Work]]. Work hired Goren to help with his bridge articles and columns, and eventually Goren began [[ghostwriter|ghostwriting]] Work's material.<!-- sentences remain from the wholly unreferenced version prior to 2014-12-07 -->\n\nWork was one of numerous strong bridge players based in Philadelphia around the 1920s. He became an extraordinarily successful lecturer and writer on the game and perhaps the first who came to be called its \"Grand Old Man\". From 1928, he had popularized the 4\u20133\u20132\u20131 [[Hand evaluation|point count]] system for evaluating balanced hands (now sometimes called the Work count, Work point count, or Work points). His chief assistant [[Olive Peterson]] and young Goren established a partnership as players.<ref name=truscott4/>\n\nWork was the greatest authority on auction bridge, which was generally replaced by contract bridge during the late 1920s. Goren \"became Mr. Work's technical assistant at the end of the decade\".<ref name=truscott/>\n\nAs a player Goren's \"breakthrough\" was the 1937 Board-a-Match Teams championship (now [[Reisinger]]) won with three other Philadelphia players: [[John R. Crawford|John Crawford]], [[Charles J. Solomon|Charles Solomon]], and [[Sally Young]].<ref name=truscott/>\n\nHis breakthrough as a writer may have been when Culbertson moved a newspaper bridge column from one syndicate to another. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' of New York picked up Goren.<ref name=truscott/> <!-- unclear whether one or both of them ran a syndicate or Goren was previously syndicated; this source gives no date -P64 -->{{when|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Bridge contributions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}\n\nAfter Milton Work died in 1934, Goren began his own bridge writing career and published the first of his many books on playing bridge, ''Winning Bridge Made Easy'', in 1936.<ref name=truscott4/>  Drawing on his experience with Work's system, Goren quickly became popular as an instructor and lecturer. His subsequent lifetime of contributions to the game have made him one of the most important figures in the history of bridge.\n\nGoren became world champion at the [[Bermuda Bowl]] in 1950. Goren's books have sold millions of copies (especially ''Winning Bridge Made Easy'' and ''Contract Bridge Complete''); by 1958 his daily bridge column was appearing in 194 American newspapers. He also had a monthly column in ''[[McCall's]]'' and a weekly column in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.\n\nHis television program, ''Championship Bridge with Charles Goren'', was broadcast from 1959 to 1964 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]]. It featured numerous appearances by top players and segments with celebrity guests such as [[Chico Marx]], [[Alfred Drake]], and [[Forest Evashevski]], among others.\n\nGoren's longest partnership was with [[Helen Sobel Smith|Helen Sobel]], but he also famously partnered actor [[Omar Sharif]]. Sharif also wrote introductions to or co-authored several of Goren's bridge books, and was also co-author of Goren's newspaper column, eventually taking it over in collaboration with Tannah Hirsch.\n\n===Point count system===\n\nAs he continued writing, Goren began to develop his point count system, based on the [[Milton Work]] point count, as an improvement over the existing system of counting \"honor tricks\". Goren, with assistance, formulated a method of combining the Work count, which was based entirely on high cards, and various distributional features. This may well have improved the bidding of intermediate players and beginners almost immediately.\n\n===Four-card suits===\n\nGoren also worked to continue the practice of  opening four-card suits, with an occasional three-card club suit when the only four-card suit was a weak {{gcb|majorsuit|major}}. In this, he was following the practice established by [[Ely Culbertson]] in the early 1930s. Later on, he continued this practice, resisting the well-known ''five-card majors'' approach that has become a major feature of modern [[Standard American]] bidding.\n\nOpening a four-card suit can improve the chances of the partnership identifying a four-four trump fit, and the four-card approach is still used by experts today, notably by most [[Acol]] players. It is claimed that the drawback of the four-card approach is that the [[Law of Total Tricks]] is more difficult to apply in cases where it is used. However, the five-card majors approach became popular before the Law of Total Tricks was propounded.\n\n===Other contributions===\n\nIn addition to his pioneering work in bringing simple and effective bridge to everyday players, Goren also worked to popularize the [[Precision Club|Precision]] bidding method, which is one of many so-called big club or [[strong club system]]s (which use an opening bid of one club to indicate a strong hand).\n\n[[Tribune Media|Tribune Content Agency]] distributes the daily column Goren Bridge, written by Bob Jones, using the Goren method.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tribunecontentagency.com/premium-content/entertainment/card-games/goren-bridge/|title=Goren Bridge by Bob Jones|accessdate=May 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nGoren died on April 3, 1991, in [[Encino, California]], at the age of 90. He had lived with his nephew Marvin Goren for 19 years.<ref name=truscott/> While few players \"play Goren\" exactly today, the point-count approach he popularized remains the foundation for most bidding systems.{{efn|name=Mr}}\n\nDuring the month of Goren's death, Truscott followed his obituary with a bridge column entitled, \"Goren leaves behind many fans and a column with an international flavor\". His business interests had been \"managed by others\" since his retirement \"a quarter of a century ago\", according to Truscott. \"The Goren syndicated column now has an international flavor: It carries the bylines of the movie star [[Omar Sharif]], an Egyptian who lives in Paris, and an entrepreneur, Tannah Hirsch, a South African who came to the United States via Israel.\"<ref name=truscott3/>\n\n==Bridge accomplishments==\n\n===Honors===\n\n* ACBL Hall of Fame, 1964<ref name=HOFby>[http://www.acbl.org/about-acbl/hall-of-fame/induction-by-year \"Induction by Year\"].

Formerly a mortal man, Galactus is a [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] who originally consumed planets to sustain his life force, and serves a functional role in the upkeep of the [[Earth-616|primary Marvel continuity]]. Galactus was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in the comic book ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #48, published in March 1966.\n\nLee and Kirby wanted to introduce a character that broke away from the archetype of the standard villain. In the character's first appearance, Galactus was depicted as a god-like figure who feeds by draining living planets of their energy, and operates without regard to the morality and judgments of mortal beings. Galactus' initial origin was that of a space explorer named Galan who gained cosmic abilities by passing near a star, but writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] further developed the origin of the character, revealing that Galan lived during the previous universe that existed prior to the [[Big Bang]] which began the current universe. As Galan's universe came to an end, Galan merged with the \"[[Eternity (comics)|Sentience of the Universe]]\" to become Galactus, an entity that wielded such cosmic power as to require devouring entire planets to sustain his existence. Additional material written by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[Jim Starlin]], and [[Louise Simonson]] explored Galactus' role and purpose in the Marvel Universe, and examined the actions of the character through themes of genocide, manifest destiny, ethics, and natural/necessary existence. Frequently accompanied by a herald (such as the [[Silver Surfer]]), the character has appeared as both antagonist and protagonist in central and supporting roles. Since debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Galactus has played a role in over five decades of Marvel continuity.\n\nThe character has been featured in other Marvel media, such as [[arcade game]]s, [[video game]]s, animated television series, and the 2007 film ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''.\n\nIn 2009, Galactus ranked 5th on [[IGN]]'s list of \"Top 100 Comic Book Villains\", citing the character's \"larger than life presence\" as making him one of the more important villains ever created. IGN also noted \"Galactus is one of the few villains on our list to really defy the definition of an evil-doer\" as the character is compelled to destroy worlds because of his hunger.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/5.html \"Galactus is number 5\"] [[IGN]], 2009.</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist-coplotter [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[first appearance|debuted]] in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #48 (March 1966, the first of a three-issue story later known as \"[[The Galactus Trilogy]]\").<ref name=\"TR\">Thomas, Roy, ''Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe'' (Sterling Publishing, New York, 2006), \"Moment 29: The Galactus Trilogy\", pp. 112\u2013115. {{ISBN|1-4027-4225-8}}; {{ISBN|978-1-4027-4225-5}}</ref><ref name=\"kirbycollector1\">{{Cite journal\n  | last = Hatfield\n  | first = Charles\n  | author-link =\n  | title = The Galactus Trilogy: An Appreciation\n  | journal = The Collected Jack Kirby Collector\n  | volume = 1\n  | page = 211\n  |date=February 2004\n  | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n===Origin===\n{{Main|The Galactus Trilogy}}\nIn 1966, nearly five years after launching [[Marvel Comics]]' flagship [[superhero]] title, ''Fantastic Four'', creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] collaborated on an antagonist designed to break the [[supervillain]] mold of the tyrant with god-like stature and power.<ref name=\"kirbycollector1\" /> As Lee recalled in 1993,\n\n{{quote|Galactus was simply another in a long line of super-villains whom we loved creating. Having dreamed up [many] powerful baddies ... we felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evil-doer who had almost godlike powers. Therefore, the natural choice was some sort of demi-god, but now what would we do with him. We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world. ... That was when inspiration struck. Why not have him not be a really evil person? After all, a demi-god would be beyond mere good and evil. ...

And I had to come up with characters that were no longer stereotypes. ... I had to get something new. And ... for some reason, I went to the Bible. And I came up with Galactus. And there I was in front of this tremendous figure, who I knew very well, because I always felt him, and I certainly couldn't treat him the same way that I would any ordinary mortal ... and of course the Silver Surfer is the fallen angel. ... [T]hey were figures that have never been used before in comics. They were above mythic figures, and of course, they were the first gods.<ref>{{cite video\n  | people = Viola, Ken\n  | title = The Masters of Comic Book Art\n  | medium = VHS\n  | publisher = Viola, Ken\n  | location = USA\n  |date= 1987 }}</ref>}}\n\nKirby elaborated, \"Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way.\"<ref>Christensen, William A., and Mark Seifert.

Rather than traveling into a dying star, the character enters [[World egg#Influences on science fiction and popular culture|the core of the collapsing universe]] before the [[Big Bang]]; the story was later reprinted as ''Origin of Galactus'' #1 (Feb. 1996).\n\nThe character guest-starred in ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #26\u201327 (Jan. \u2013 Feb. 1982).

At the end of the story, [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], an abstract entity in the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus; [[Howard University]] professor of literature Marc Singer criticized this, accusing writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] of using the character to \"justify planetary-scale genocide.\"<ref>Singer, Marc.

Simonson originally conceived that the [[story arc]] would occur in the third volume of ''Silver Surfer'', but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales.

It is the successor of the [[Game Boy]].\n\nThe Game Boy Color features a [[RGB color model|color screen]]. It is slightly thicker and taller and features a slightly smaller screen than the [[Game Boy Pocket]], its predecessor. As with the original Game Boy, it has a custom [[8-bit]] processor made by [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] that is considered a hybrid between the [[Intel 8080]] and the [[Zilog Z80]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://realboyemulator.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/the-nintendo-game-boy-1/|title=The Nintendo\u00ae Game Boy\u2122, Part 1: The Intel 8080 and the Zilog Z80.|publisher=RealBoy|accessdate=2017-08-29}}</ref> The spelling of the system's name, ''Game Boy Color'', remains consistent throughout the world with its [[American English]] spelling of color.\n\nThe Game Boy Color's primary competitors in Japan were the grayscale 16-bit handhelds [[Neo Geo Pocket]] and the [[WonderSwan]], though the Game Boy Color outsold these by a wide margin. [[SNK]] and [[Bandai]] countered with the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] and the [[Wonderswan Color]] respectively but this did little to change Nintendo's sales dominance. With Sega discontinuing the Game Gear in 1997, the Game Boy Color's only competitor in the United States was its predecessor, the Game Boy, until the short-lived Neo Geo Pocket Color was released in August 1999. The Game Boy and Game Boy Color combined have sold 118.69 million units worldwide making it the 3rd best selling system of all time.<ref name=\"consolidatedsales\" /><ref name=\"bweek\"/> It was discontinued in 2003, shortly after the release of the [[Game Boy Advance SP]].\n\n==History==\nThe Game Boy Color was a response to pressure from game developers for a more sophisticated handheld platform, as they felt that the Game Boy, even in its latest incarnation, the [[Game Boy Pocket]], was insufficient.{{citation needed| date= September 2013}} The resultant product was [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]], a first for a handheld system, and leveraged the large library of games and installed base of the predecessor system. This became a major feature of the [[Game Boy line]], since it allowed each new launch to begin with a significantly larger library than any of its competitors.\n\n===Launch titles===\n* [[Tetris DX]]\n* [[Wario Land II]]\n* [[Pocket Bomberman]]\n\n==Specifications==\n{{main article|Comparison of Nintendo portable consoles}}\n\n===Summary===\n[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-Motherboard-Bottom.jpg|thumb|right|The Game Boy Color motherboard]]\nThe technical specifications for the console are as follows:<ref name=\"technical specification\">{{cite web |url=http://www.consoledatabase.com/consoleinfo/nintendogameboycolor/|title=Nintendo Game Boy Color Console Information \u2013 Console Database |accessdate=2011-02-19 |publisher=ConsoleDatabase.com}}</ref>\n* '''Main processor:''' [[Sharp Corporation]] LR35902 (based on the 8-bit [[Zilog Z80]])\n* '''Processor speed:''' 1.0485 (speed of original Game Boy) or 2.097&nbsp;MHz (two processor modes)\n* '''Resolution:''' 160 \u00d7 144 pixels (10:9 aspect ratio, same aspect ratio and resolution as the original [[Game Boy]])\n* '''Palette colors available:''' 32,768 (16-bit)\n* '''Colors on screen:''' Supports 10, 32 or 56\n* '''Maximum sprites:''' 40 total, 10 per line, 4 colors per sprite (one of which being transparent)\n* '''Sprite size:''' 8\u00d78 or 8\u00d716\n* '''Tiles on screen:''' 512 (360~399 visible, the rest are drawn off screen as a scrolling buffer)\n* '''Audio:''' 2 square wave channels, 1 wave channel, 1 noise channel, mono speaker, stereo headphone jack\n* '''ROM:''' 8&nbsp;MB maximum\n* '''RAM:''' 32&nbsp;kB\n* '''VRAM:''' 16&nbsp;kB\n* '''Cartridge RAM:''' 128&nbsp;kB\n* '''Power:'''\n** internal: 2 [[AA battery|AA batteries]], up to 10 hours of gameplay\n** external: 3V&nbsp;DC 0.6W (2.35mm \u00d7 0.75mm)\n** indicator: Red [[LED]]\n* '''Input:'''\n** 8-way [[D-pad]]\n** 4 buttons (A, B, Start, Select)\n** Volume [[potentiometer]]\n** Power switch\n** Serial I/O (\"Link cable\"): 512&nbsp;kbit/s with up to 4 connections in serial\n** Infra-red I/O: Less than 2&nbsp;m distance at 45\u00b0\n** Cartridge I/O\n* '''Dimensions:'''\n** Metric: 133.5 x 78 x 27.4&nbsp;mm\n** Imperial: 5.25 x 3.07 x 1.07 in\n* '''Weight:''' 138 g<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Game-Boy-Pocket-Color/Product-information/Technical-data/Technical-data-619585.html|title=Technical data|website=Nintendo of Europe GmbH|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-04}}</ref>\nThe processor, which is a [[Z80]] workalike made by [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] with a few extra (bit manipulation) instructions, has a clock speed of approximately 8&nbsp;MHz, twice as fast as that of the original Game Boy. The Game Boy Color also has three times as much memory as the original (32 kilobytes system RAM, 16 kilobytes video RAM). The screen resolution was the same as the original Game Boy, which is 160\u00d7144 pixels.\n\nThe Game Boy Color also featured an [[infrared]] communications port for wireless linking. The feature was only supported in a small number of games, so the infrared port was dropped from the [[Game Boy Advance]] line, to be later reintroduced with the [[Nintendo 3DS]], though wireless linking (using [[Wi-Fi]]) would return in the [[Nintendo DS]] line. The console was capable of showing up to 56 different colors simultaneously on screen from its [[Palette (computing)|palette]] of 32,768 (8\u00d74 color background palettes, 8x3+transparent sprite palettes), and could add basic four-, seven- or ten-color shading to games that had been developed for the original 4-shades-of-grey Game Boy. In the 7-color modes, the sprites and backgrounds were given separate color schemes, and in the 10-color modes the sprites were further split into two differently-colored groups; however, as flat black (or white) was a shared fourth color in all but one (7-color) palette, the overall effect was that of 4, 6 or 8 colors. This method of upgrading the color count resulted in graphic artifacts in certain games; for example, a sprite that was supposed to meld into the background would sometimes be colored separately, making it easily noticeable. The system also featured a rarely used \"high color mode\", capable of displaying more than 2,000 colors on the screen simultaneously.<ref name=\"aloneinthedark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/05/first-alone-in-the-dark-screenshots-for-game-boy-color|title=First Alone in the Dark Screenshots for Game Boy Color|date=4 August 2000|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Color palettes used for original Game Boy games====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+ Alternate Color Palettes\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Directional pad\n! colspan=\"3\" | Action button\n|-\n!

However, when the user turns on the system, they may choose one of 12 built in color palettes by pressing certain button combinations (namely a direction key and optionally A or B) while the Game Boy logo is present on the screen.\n\nThese palettes each contain up to ten colors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/gameboyadvance/colorchange.jsp |title=Changing the Color Palette on Game Boy Advance Systems |work=Customer Service |publisher=Nintendo |date= |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>  In most games, the four shades displayed on the original Game Boy would translate to different subsets of this 10-color palette, such as by displaying movable [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] in one subset and backgrounds, etc. in another. The grayscale (Left + B) palette produces an appearance similar to that experienced on the original Game Boy.\n[[File:GBC keypad palettes.png|right|thumb|Illustrated color-samples of the palettes for the different key-combinations.

These games would display a warning message and refuse to play if used in older Game Boy models. Games that are designed for the Game Boy Color, but which also include backwards-compatibility with the previous Game Boy systems, are shaped like original Game Boy games, but usually have black colored cartridges. [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] are also examples of Game Boy Color games that work on an original Game Boy system.

Games that are designed for the Game Boy Color, but which also include backward compatibility with the Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, Super Game Boy, Super Game Boy 2 and the Japanese-exclusive Game Boy Light, use the same cartridge shape as original Game Boy games, but are typically black and never gray. In some colorized versions of games like ''R-Type DX'', it only managed to get the monochrome versions and not the full color versions if you're playing on Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, Super Game Boy, Super Game Boy 2 and Game Boy Light.\n\n===Colors produced===\n{{See also|List of Game Boy colors and styles#Game Boy Color}}\nThe logo for Game Boy Color spelled out the word \"COLOR\" in the five original colors in which the unit was manufactured. They were named:\n\n* Berry (C)\n* Grape (O)\n* Kiwi (L)\n* Dandelion (O)\n* Teal (R)\nAnother color released at the same time was \"Atomic Purple\", made of a transparent purple plastic that was also used on the color-respective [[Nintendo 64]] controller.\n\nOther colors were sold as limited editions or in specific countries.\n\n==Games==\n{{Main article|List of Game Boy Color games}} \n\nDue to its backwards compatibility with Game Boy games, the Game Boy Color had a large playable library at launch. The system amassed an impressive library of 576 Game Boy Color games over a four-year period. While the majority of the games were Game Boy Color exclusive, approximately 30% of the titles released were backwards compatible with the original Game Boy.\n\nWhile [[Tetris (Game Boy)|Tetris]] for the original Game Boy was the best selling game compatible with the system, [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver]] were the best selling games developed for the Game Boy Color. The best selling Game Boy Color exclusive game was [[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal]].\n\nThe last ''Game Boy Color'' game ever released was the Japanese exclusive ''Doraemon no Study Boy: Kanji Yomikaki Master'', which was released in Japan on July 18, 2003. In North America and Europe, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', released in November 2002, was the last game released.\n\n==Sales==\nThe [[Game Boy]] and Game Boy Color were both commercially successful, selling a combined 32.47 million units in Japan, 44.06 million in the [[Americas]], and 42.16 million in other regions.<ref name=\"consolidatedsales\"/><ref name=\"bweek\"/>\n\nIn 2003, when the Game Boy Color was discontinued, the pair was the best selling gaming console of all time. Both the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[PlayStation 2]] would go on to outsell the pair and the Game Boy/Game Boy Color is now the third best selling system of all time and the second best selling handheld.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Nintendo}}\n\n* [[Player's Choice#Game Boy & Game Boy Color|List of Player's Choice games]]\n* [[List of Game Boy accessories]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Game Boy Color}}\n* {{Official website|https://web.archive.org/web/20160118170958/http://gameboy.com/}}\n* [https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/gameboy/index.jsp Game Boy Color] at Nintendo.com ([https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.nintendo.com/systemsclassic?type=gbc archived versions] at the [[Digital time capsule|Internet Archive Wayback Machine]])\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040212061705/http://www.nintendo.com/doc/cgb_games.pdf] at Nintendo.com (archived from {{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/gameslist/manuals/cgb_games.pdf |title=the original |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903070828/http://www.nintendo.com/doc/cgb_games.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-03}} at the [[Digital time capsule|Internet Archive Wayback Machine]])\n* {{dmoz|Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms/Nintendo/Game_Boy_Color}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/19980530162411/http://www.nintendo.com/corp/press/030998.html Nintendo Announces Full Color Game Boy - ROME (March 10, 1998)]\n{{Game Boy line}}\n{{Nintendo hardware|Game Boy Color}}\n{{Fifth generation game consoles}}\n{{Handheld game consoles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Game Boy Color}}\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Products and services discontinued in 2003]]\n[[Category:Backward-compatible video game consoles]]\n[[Category:Fifth-generation video game consoles]]\n[[Category:Game Boy consoles]]\n[[Category:Regionless game consoles]]\n[[Category:Handheld game consoles]]\n[[Category:1990s toys]]\n[[Category:2000s toys]]\n[[Category:Z80]]\n[[Category:Discontinued products]]\n\n[[de:Game Boy#Game Boy Color]]", "sha1": "4znt9kdcu6jngmrgrxhwx1nsyc4t6ju"}}, {"title": "Genosha", "ns": "0", "id": "13098", "revision": {"id": "861038065", "parentid": "855238415", "timestamp": "2018-09-24T19:10:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "Omnipaedista", "id": "8524693"}, "comment": "add IPAc-en", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox fictional location\n| name        = Genosha\n| image       = \n| image_size  = \n| caption     = \n| blank_label = [[:Category:Comics publishing companies|Publisher]]\n| blank_data  = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| first       = ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #235<br> (October 1988)\n| creators    = [[Chris Claremont]] <br> [[Rick Leonardi]]\n| type        = [[Africa]]n country\n| people      = Genoshans\n| races       = Humans, [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutants]]\n| locations   = Hammer Bay, Ridgeback Mountains, Carrion Cave\n}}\n'''Genosha''' ({{IPAc-en|\u0261|\u0259|\u02c8|n|o\u028a|\u0283|\u0259}}) is a [[fictional country]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It is an island nation that exists in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as \"Earth 616\" in the [[Marvel Universe]] and a prominent place in the [[X-Men]] chronology. The fictional nation served as an [[allegory]] for [[slavery]] and later for [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] before becoming a mutant [[homeland]] and subsequently a disaster zone.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The island is located off the Southeastern African coast northwest from [[Seychelles]] and northeast of [[Madagascar]]. Its capital city was Hammer Bay.\n\n==Publication history==\nGenosha first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #235 (October 1988), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Rick Leonardi]].\n\nGenosha received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #3.\n\n==Fictional country history==\n\n===Mutant apartheid===\nThe island is located off the east coast of [[Africa]], to the north of [[Madagascar]], and boasted a high standard of living, an excellent economy, and freedom from the political and racial turmoil that characterized neighboring nations. However, Genosha's prosperity was built upon the enslavement of its [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] population. Mutants in Genosha were the property of the state and children who were positively identified with the mutant gene were put through a process developed by [[David Moreau]], commonly known as the Genegineer, stripped of free will and made into \"[[Mutate (comics)|mutates]]\" (a Marvel term for genetically modified individuals, as opposed to those who developed mutant powers naturally). The Genegineer was also capable of modifying certain mutant abilities in order to fulfill specific labor shortages. Citizenship in Genosha is permanent and the government does not recognize any emigration. Citizens who attempt to leave the country are tracked down and forcibly brought back to the island by the special force known as [[Press Gang (comics)|Press Gang]]. The Press Gang consisted of Hawkshaw, Pipeline, and Punchout, and were aided in their task by [[Wipeout (comics)|Wipeout]]. Mutant problems are handled by a special group known as the [[Magistrates (comics)|Magistrates]].\nThe foundations of Genoshan society has been upset in recent years due to the efforts of outside mutant interests. In the first storyline to feature the nation, some members of the [[X-Men]] ([[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], and their ally [[Madelyne Pryor]]) were kidnapped by Genoshan Magistrates, under the order of the Genegineer.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #235-238</ref> Later, in the multi-issue, multi-title ''[[X-Tinction Agenda]]'' storyline, the X-Men and their allies rescued their teammates, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Tabitha Smith|Meltdown]], [[Rictor]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], from Genoshan brainwashing, toppling the government after discovering their alliance with former [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] ally turned mutant hater, [[Cameron Hodge]], and that [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] was one of the Magistrates since having his memory wiped by the Siege Perilous. Havok himself, woken from his conditioning by his brother [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] dealt the killing blow to Cameron Hodge in the process.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men '' #270-272, ''New Mutants'' #95-97, ''X-Factor'' #60-62</ref>\n\n===Conflict and Magneto's reign===\nA new Genoshan regime that promised better treatment of mutants was put in place after Hodge's destruction. A period of general turmoil and a number of attacks by superhumans, including [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto's]] [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] who were unwilling to forgive the former Genoshan government for its crimes against mutants, followed.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\nA different version of X-Factor, including Wolfsbane, later returned to the island to help restore peace between its government and a rogue group of super-powered beings that had fled the island. The Genoshan government was shown with peaceful intentions, even trying to undo the ill effects visited upon Wolfsbane. Genosha was also shown to have typical suburban tract housing, like many small towns in America.<ref>\"X-Factor\" Vol. 1 #89</ref>\n\nAfter the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" story arc, it was revealed and [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] that the mutate process formula was given to the Genegineer by [[Sugar Man]], a refugee of the ''Age of Apocalypse'' timeline.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\nThe [[United Nations]] ceded the island nation to the powerful mutant [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], after he demanded an entire mutants-only nation.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #87 (Apr 1999)</ref><ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49\u201351 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> Magneto and his Acolytes managed to reestablish a modicum of peace and stability only briefly until civil war broke out between him and the remaining human population on the island led by the Magistrates. Magneto eventually defeated the Magistrates and restored order to most of the island, with hold-outs briefly remaining at Carrion Cove before being obliterated.\n\nThe elimination of the [[Legacy Virus]] gave Magneto a freshly healthy army, leading him to declare a campaign of global conquest.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} A small team of X-Men stopped this plan, badly injuring Magneto in the process<ref>X-Men Vol.2 #113, p.21</ref> (the original issue presented him as being killed, but this was retconned in the ''[[New X-Men]]'' comic book series{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}).\n\nBy ''New X-Men'' #115, Genosha had a population of sixteen million mutants and a stable, advanced society. However, the entire island was reduced to rubble and its mutant population was slain by [[Cassandra Nova]]'s Wild [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. There were few survivors, many evacuated, and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] turned one of the Sentinels into a memorial statue in #132.\n\n===Xavier's leadership===\nMagneto and Xavier have since then joined forces to rebuild the island nation as detailed in the series ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' vol. 3 (2004). This goes badly as foreign military forces have thrown up a cordon around the island; no one is allowed to enter, and those trying to leave are fired upon.\n\nA few survivors and newly arriving mutants who wish to help with the rebuilding process remain on the island. Members of this volunteer 'army' include [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], [[Freakshow (comics)|Freakshow]] and [[Wicked (comics)|Wicked]]. More are found in the surrounding countryside, some join with Xavier. There is a conflict with Magistrates, the island's former law enforcement. Though they are assisted by humanoid creatures they refer to as 'trolls', the Magistra's forces are driven off. Some of the Magistrates are captured and kept in the island's makeshift jail.\n\nIn ''Excalibur'' #6, some of the captured Magistrates agree to work with Xavier to rebuild the island. Throughout the entire series, [[Unus the Untouchable]] and his squadron of mutants remain a problem; they do not wish to be part of Xavier's group.\n\n===House of M===\n{{Main|House of M}}\nLater Magneto learned of his daughter the Scarlet Witch's nervous break-down and her ever-growing powers to alter reality. Magneto snatched Wanda from her battle with her fellow Avengers and brought her to Genosha, where he asked Xavier to restore the Scarlet Witch\u2019s sanity - but to no avail. The telepath couldn\u2019t help her and, concerned of the threat to reality that Wanda posed, Xavier consulted the Avengers and the X-Men about what to do with her. Their decision was rendered moot, though, as by the time they reached Genosha reality altered around the heroes - changing into the world ruled by the \"[[House of M]]\".\n\nWhile conventional reality was eventually restored, it came at a high price, as thousands if not millions of Earth\u2019s mutant population lost their powers or died in the process, leaving only a few hundred mutants alive and powered. Just like most of his new Genoshan allies and enemies, Magneto was among the depowered people, remaining trapped on the island.\n\n===Son of M and the Collective Incident===\n{{Main|Son of M}}\nIn the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Son of M]]'' there is a battle between some of the remaining mutants and the [[Inhumans]].\n\nIn [[The New Avengers (comics)|''New Avengers'']] #19-20 it was stated that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, and the same held true for the energies of the numerous depowered mutants. Eventually, these energies gathered in the form of an unsuspecting energy-absorbing mutant named [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]]. Dubbed \"the Collective\" by the Avengers, against whom he then fought, the Collective traveled to Genosha and reached out to the startled Magneto. The Collective, controlled by [[Xorn]], attempted to restore Magneto\u2019s powers and convince him to lead the remaining mutants into taking over the planet. To the Collective\u2019s surprise, Magneto resisted and allowed the Avengers to separate the energy from his body and send it into the sun. The comatose Magneto is also taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, but the helicopter that was supposed to transport him off Genosha explodes once it lifts off. Magneto\u2019s body is not found. It has since been revealed that he survived the explosion and remained depowered until the [[High Evolutionary]]'s dangerous experiment returned his magnetic abilities.\n\n===Silent War===\n{{Main|Silent War}}\nTo date Genosha is now completely dead. Already in ruins before, the battle between the Inhumans and the O*N*E further destroyed the once-proud island nation.\n\nSince Magneto was the last person on Genosha, it seems that it\u2019s now totally uninhabited, which is corroborated by [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] and [[Speed (comics)|Speed]] when they began their search for their mother, the Scarlet Witch. They encountered Genosha an empty land filled with destroyed towers and empty streets.\n\n===Necrosha and beyond===\n{{Main|Necrosha}}\n[[Selene (comics)|Selene]] is seen traveling to the ruined island of Genosha with her followers who were resurrected by the Technarch transmode virus. Led there by [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], who tells Selene he senses millions of dead mutants. They enter the ruins and Selene proclaims Hammer Bay, the devastated capital of the island nation  Necrosha, the place where she will become a god.<ref>''X-Necrosha'' #1</ref>\n\nWith Eli Bard, Selene resurrects the massacred residents of Genosha, with [[Cerebro]] and [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]'s computers detecting the rise of mutant numbers into the millions.<ref>''X-Force'' #21</ref> A problem presents itself in that many of the newly resurrected mutants have been de-powered, despite having been killed ''before'' [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. [[Wither (comics)|Wither]] and [[Lois London|Mortis]] explain what happened and the Coven begins to set up base at Necrosha.\n\nSelene is eventually defeated and killed, thus ending the effect of the corrupted Techno-organic virus in the bodies she revived<ref>''X-Force'' #25</ref> and returning Genosha to an empty land. According to writer Chris Yost, Elixir is still on Necrosha.\n\nDuring a visit to Genosha by the students of Jean Grey's School for Gifted Youngsters' students organized by Beast and Kitty Pryde, Sabretooth and AOA Blob assaulted Kid Gladiator and Kid Omega in order to kidnap Genesis. During this time, there were no mentionings of Elixir living here.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #30''</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Magneto enters the island of Genosha to find that it had turned into a concentration camp for mutants. He frees two mutant girls who tell him that Red Skull is responsible and possesses Professor X's brain. Magneto attacks Red Skull, but is quickly stopped by the Skull's S-Men.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #9</ref> Magneto is captured and telepathically tortured by Red Skull. He is given visions of those closest to him suffering while being unable to do anything to stop it. After being freed by Scarlet Witch, Rogue, and Havok, he bites down on a vial beneath his skin of Mutant Growth Hormone, giving himself enough power to fight.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> Havok, Rogue, and Scarlet Witch are captured by the Red Skull's S-Men and sent to his concentration camp in Genosha. Rogue (who still has Wonder Man inside her) is able to break the group free. They discover Magneto has been captured, and free him, as well. The three want to leave the island and alert the rest of the Avengers and X-Men of what Red Skull is doing, but Magneto says he's going to stay and fight. Before they can do anything, Red Skull appears.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #24</ref> Magneto, Rogue, and the Scarlet Witch fought Red Onslaught in Genosha and are later joined by the Avengers and the X-Men. Iron Man used a telepathic tamperer to stop the Red Skull's influence. When more heroes arrived to help, Red Onslaught revealed that he influenced Stark to create a model of Sentinels, based on the knowledge of different super heroes he acquired after the Civil War before erasing the latter's memories of constructing them. Red Onslaught then deployed his Stark Sentinels to fight the heroes.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #1</ref>\n\n===All-New, All-Different Marvel===\nAs part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Magneto and his [[Uncanny_X-Men#2015.E2.80.93present:_Volume_4|Uncanny X-Men]] use Genosha as a staging ground for an ambush on the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], who have been targeting mutants with healing powers. After defeating the Dark Riders, Magneto then ties up the Dark Riders and sets off a bomb that kills them and also levels the entire island. It was a sign that Magneto has \"no intention of 'Laying Low'.\"<ref> Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 Issue #5</ref>\n\n==Points of interest==\n* '''Carrion Cove''' -\n* '''Hammer Bay''' - The capital of Genosha which is the largest city on Genosha. Sugar Man has a secret laboratory underneath Hammer Bay.\n** '''Magda Square''' - \n** '''Magneto Monument''' - A monument made from a Wild Sentinel by the Brotherhood of Mutants following the Wild Sentinels attack on Genosha.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Marvel Noir===\nIn this reality, there is a prison called Genosha Bay Prison which is somewhat similar to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guant\u00e1namo Bay]]. It was originally settled by Quaker missionaries who built a penitentiary so to isolate prisoners from each other so they could contemplate the gravity of their sins. By the 1930s, Genosha Bay later became a United States extraterritorial prison which hold prisoners of the worse cases from around the world and was notorious for practicing [[inhumane punishment]]s on its prisoners ranging from sleep deprivations and water torture. Genosha Bay Prison caught the notice of the public and culminating in a Senate Judiciary Meeting on consider closing the prison. Even if the prison were to be close down, lawmakers were unwilling to let its more severe criminal sociopaths from allowing into America's prisons. In reality, Genosha Bay Prison was used as a proving ground in recruiting the prisoners as a next generation of government operatives.<ref>''X-Men Noir: Mark of Cain'' #1</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] reality, Genosha has made an appearance. It is an island south of Madagascar. Its main export seems to be television programs. Mutants were recently reduced to [[second-class citizen]]s after the murder of a government minister by a mutant called [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]]. Citizens include [[Mojo (comics)#Ultimate Mojo|Mojo Adams]], [[Spiral (comics)#Ultimate Spiral|Spiral]], and [[Deadpool#Ultimate Marvel|Deadpool]].\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In the 1990s animated TV series ''[[X-Men (1992 TV series)|X-Men]]'', Genosha claims to be a mutant-friendly environment where those possessing the \"X-gene\" could live peacefully without fear of persecution. However, as soon as mutants travel there, they are captured and fitted with power-negating collars placed around their necks; they are put to work building [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] for the Genoshan government, under the direction of [[Bolivar Trask]], [[Cameron Hodge]], [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], and a government official known as \"the Leader.\" With the help of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and a flood orchestrated by Storm, the X-Men simultaneously free the mutant slaves and destroy the Sentinels. Genosha continues to enslave mutants employing Sentinels and Magistrates, until they are rescued by Magneto and his Acolytes with the aid of many mutants (examples being [[Random (comics)|Random]], [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]], [[Tar Baby (comics)|Tar Baby]], [[Blockbuster (Marvel Comics)|Blockbuster]], [[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peepers]], the second [[Randall Darby|Shocker]], and even [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Professor X]]). All Genoshan mutants leave for [[Asteroid M]]. Before long, the country is taken over by Magneto who is ready to declare war on humanity with the Genoshan mutants by his side, following an attack on Professor X during an anti-mutant summit. He never follows through with his plans though as he is called to a dying Xavier's side in the series' final episode.\n* In the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' continuity, Genosha is a mutant paradise under Magneto's rule. Magneto offers the country as a sanctuary for other mutants around the world, promising peace and equality. Despite the facade of a mutant paradise, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] (who intends on becoming a Genoshan resident) soon learns from [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] that Magneto is an oppressive ruler who [[incarceration|unfairly incarcerates]] Genosha mutants who do not abide by his rules. In \"Battle Lines,\" it is revealed that Senator Kelly gave Genosha to Magneto. In \"Aces and Eights\", Genosha has closed off its borders. This same episode continually present Genosha as a monarchy by depicted Magneto as a King. In the three-part episode \"Foresight,\" Magneto has Mystique pose as Senator Kelly and unleash the Sentinels on Genosha. This was part of Magneto's plan to reprogram them to attack humans only to face problems with the Phoenix Force. After the Phoenix Force is stopped, many of Magneto's followers have lost faith in his methods. Scarlet Witch and Polaris have Blink teleport Magneto and Quicksilver away from Genosha. Though Genosha is no longer Magneto's country, Scarlet Witch tells Quicksilver that he is always welcome to return.\n\n===Film===\n* In the film, ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', Genosha serves as an island located a few miles from the coast of the eastern seaboard, with a small size, rendering it virtually undetectable. Inside, the island is heavily fortified by Magneto, reinforced with steel girders, heavy titanium furnishings, and metallic walkways.

Each man pledged to gather a church and together the group or band would seek to establish a college. When the group arrived in Iowa later that year, each selected a different town in which to establish a congregation. In 1846, they collectively established '''Iowa College''' in [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]]. A few months later, Iowa joined the [[United States|Union]].\n\nThe first 25 years of Grinnell's history saw a change in name and location. Iowa College moved farther west from Davenport, Iowa, to the town of Grinnell and unofficially adopted the name of its new home, which itself had been named for one of its founders: an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] minister, [[Josiah Bushnell Grinnell]], to whom journalist [[Horace Greeley]] supposedly wrote \"[[Go West, young man]], go West.\"<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7yhCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA86 | title = Men and Events of Forty Years | accessdate = 12 February 2009| last = Grinnell | first = Josiah | publisher = [[D. Lothrop]] | location = Boston | year = 1891 | page = 87}}</ref> However, Greeley vehemently denied ever saying this to Grinnell, or to anyone.<ref>Wall, Joseph Frazier. Grinnell College in the Nineteenth Century: From Salvation to Service. (Ames: Iowa State University Press), 91-92.</ref> The name of the corporation, \"The Trustees of Iowa College,\" remained, but in 1909 the name \"Grinnell College\" was adopted by the trustees for the institution.[[File:Josiah Bushnell Grinnell - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Josiah Bushnell Grinnell]]: one of the four founders of Grinnell, Iowa and benefactor of Grinnell College.]]\n\nIn its early years, the College experienced setbacks. Although two students received bachelor of arts degrees in 1854 (the first to be granted by a college west of the [[Mississippi River]]), within 10 years the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] had claimed most of Grinnell's students and professors. In the decade following the war, growth resumed: women were officially admitted as candidates for degrees, and the curriculum was enlarged to include then-new areas of academic studies, such as [[natural sciences]] with laboratory work.\n\nIn 1882, Grinnell College was struck by a tornado \u2014 then called a cyclone, after which the college yearbook was named. The storm devastated the campus and destroyed both College buildings. Rebuilding began immediately, and the determination to expand wasn't limited to architecture: the curriculum was again extended to include departments in [[political science]] (the first in the United States) and modern languages.\n[[File:Louis Sullivan Jewel Box, Grinnell, Iowa.jpg|alt=Merchants' National Bank|left|thumb|The [[Louis Sullivan]]-designed \"jewel box\" [[Merchants' National Bank]] in downtown Grinnell, a member of the [[Grinnell Historic Commercial District]]]]\nGrinnell became known as the center of the [[Social Gospel]] reform movement,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=J.|year=1969|title=The Development of Sociology and the Social Gospel in America|periodical=Sociological Analysis|volume=30|issue=1| pages=42\u201353| doi = 10.2307/3709933| jstor = 3709933| publisher = Oxford University Press}}. see footnote 4.</ref> as Robert Handy writes, \"The movement centered on the campus of Iowa (now Grinnell) College.

Roosevelt]]'s presidency, when Grinnell graduates [[Harry Hopkins]] '12, Chester Davis '11, [[Paul H. Appleby|Paul Appleby]] '13, [[Hallie Flanagan]] '11, and Florence Kerr '12 became influential [[New Deal]] administrators.\n\nConcern with social issues, educational innovation, and individual expression continue to shape Grinnell. As an example, the school\u2019s \"5th year travel-service program,\" preceded the establishment of the [[Peace Corps]] by many years. Other recent innovations include first-year tutorials, cooperative pre-professional programs, and programs in quantitative studies and the societal impacts of technology. Every year, the college awards the $100,000 [[Grinnell College Innovator for Social Justice Prize]], which is split between the recipient and their organization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grinnell.edu/grinnellprize|title=Grinnell Prize {{!}} Grinnell College|website=www.grinnell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}</ref> \n\n== Campus ==\nGrinnell College is located in the town of [[Grinnell, Iowa]], about halfway between [[Des Moines, IA|Des Moines]] and [[Iowa City, IA|Iowa City]].

The sole [[Core curriculum|core, or general education, requirement]] is the completion of the First-Year Tutorial, a one-semester, [[Course credit|four-credit]] special topics [[seminar]] that stresses methods of inquiry, critical analysis, and writing skills. All other classes are chosen, with the direct guidance of a faculty member in the student's major department, by the student.\n\nThe academic program at Grinnell College emphasizes active learning and one-on-one interactions between faculty members and students. There are few large lecture classes. In sharp contrast to all [[public universities]] and many private universities in the United States, no classes, labs or other courses are taught by [[graduate students]].\n\nGrinnell College expects all students to possess significant academic achievements. For example, the math department does not offer any basic-level classes such as college algebra, trigonometry, or pre-calculus,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grinnell.edu/academic/catalog/courses/mathstats/|title=Mathematics and Statistics courses offered|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620225431/http://www.grinnell.edu/academic/catalog/courses/mathstats/|archivedate=2010-06-20|df=}}</ref> and remedial classes are not offered in any subject. However, several independent, non-credit programs assist students who need help in a specific subject. Among these programs are the Library Lab, Math Lab, Reading Lab, Science Learning Center, and the Writing Lab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grinnell.edu/academic/|title=Academics|work=grinnell.edu}}</ref> While private tutors can be hired, participation in these programs is free for any enrolled student.\n\nGrinnell has twenty-six major departments and ten interdisciplinary concentrations. Popular majors include [[Psychology]], [[Economics]], [[Biology]], [[History]], [[English language|English]], and [[Political Science]]. The minimum requirements in a major area of study are typically limited to 32 credits in a single department, with some departments additionally requiring a small number of classes in related fields that are deemed critical for all students in that field. For example, the biology program requires 32 credits in the biology department plus two classes in chemistry and one in math.<ref>[http://www.grinnell.edu/academic/catalog/courses/biology/ Biology major requirements]</ref> Many students exceed the minimum requirements.\n\nTo graduate, students are normally expected to complete at least 32 credits in a major field and a total of 124 credits of academic work. To encourage students to explore courses outside of their primary interest area, no more than 48 credits in one department and no more than 92 credits in one division are counted towards this requirement.\n\n[[File:Grinnell College Bucksbaum Rotunda.jpg|thumb|left|Bucksbaum Rotunda]]\nGrinnell\u2019s commitment to the importance of off-campus study reflects the school\u2019s emphasis on social and political awareness and the international nature of its campus. Approximately 60 percent of all Grinnell students participate in at least one of more than seventy off-campus programs, including the Grinnell-in-[[London]] program and study tours of [[China]], [[France]], [[Greece]], and [[Russia]]. These study programs in [[Europe]] (including Russia), [[Africa]], the [[Near East]], and [[Asia]], as well as nine programs in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], provide the opportunity for research in many disciplines, from archaeology to education to mathematics. In addition to off-campus programs, Grinnell offers internship programs in such areas as urban studies, art, and marine biology for students interested in field-based learning and experience in professional settings. Second- and third-year students may apply for summer internship grants and receive credit for the experience. Semester programs in the United States include those at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], [[Newberry Library]], [[National Theatre Institute]], and Grinnell-in-[[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nGrinnell also has invested in several interdisciplinary programs: the Center for Prairie Studies, Center for the Humanities, Center for International Studies, Noun Program in Women's Studies, Peace Studies Program, Rosenfield Public Affairs Program, and the Donald L. Wilson Program in Enterprise and Leadership.\n\nDespite the growing trend of U.S. students taking five or more years to finish an undergraduate degree, Grinnell College is strongly oriented towards students being enrolled full-time in exactly eight consecutive semesters at the college, although exceptions are available for medical issues and other emergencies.<ref>Grinnell College. [http://www.grinnell.edu/academic/catalog/acadreg/courseloads/ \"Academic Catalog: Academic Regulations\"]</ref> To avoid being suspended from the college, students must make \"normal progress towards graduation.\" This generally means that the student must pass at least 12 credits of classes in each individual semester, with grades C or higher, and have accumulated enough credits to make graduation possible at the end of four years, which requires an average of 15.5 credits each semester. A student who is not making normal progress towards graduation is placed on academic probation and may be dismissed from the college.<ref>Grinnell College.

Dantzig's parents met during their study at the [[University of Paris]], where Tobias studied mathematics under [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], after whom Dantzig's brother was named.<ref name=\"mmp\"/> The Dantzigs immigrated to the United States, where they settled in Portland, Oregon.\n\nEarly in the 1920s the Dantzig family moved from [[Baltimore]] to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. His mother became a linguist at the [[Library of Congress]], and his father became a math tutor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. Dantzig attended Powell Junior High School and Central High School; one of his friends there was [[Abraham Seidenberg]], who also became a professional mathematician.<ref name=\"mmp\"/> By the time he reached high school he was already fascinated by geometry, and this interest was further nurtured by his father, challenging him with complicated problems, particularly in [[projective geometry]].<ref name= \"JH05\"/><ref name=\"mmp\"/>\n\nGeorge Dantzig received his B.S. from [[University of Maryland]] in 1936 in mathematics and physics, which is part of the [[University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences]]. He earned his master's degree in mathematics from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1938. After a two-year period at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, he enrolled in the doctoral program in mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he studied statistics under [[Jerzy Neyman]].\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War II]], Dantzig took a leave of absence from the doctoral program at Berkeley to join the [[U.S. Air Force]] Office of Statistical Control. In 1946, he returned to Berkeley to complete the requirements of his program and received his [[Ph.D.]] that year.<ref name = \"SR06\"/> Although he had a faculty offer from Berkeley, he returned to the Air Force as mathematical advisor to the comptroller.<ref name=\"mmp\"/>\n\nIn 1952 Dantzig joined the mathematics division of the [[RAND Corporation]]. By 1960 he became a professor in the [[University of California, Berkeley College of Engineering|Department of Industrial Engineering]] at UC Berkeley, where he founded and directed the Operations Research Center. In 1966 he joined the Stanford faculty as Professor of Operations Research and of Computer Science. A year later, the Program in Operations Research became a full-fledged department. In 1973 he founded the Systems Optimization Laboratory (SOL) there. On a sabbatical leave that year, he headed the Methodology Group at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. Later he became the C. A. Criley Professor of Transportation Sciences at [[Stanford]], and kept going, well beyond his mandatory retirement in 1985.<ref name = \"SR06\"/>\n\nHe was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Academy of Engineering]], and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. Dantzig was the recipient of many honors, including the first [[John von Neumann Theory Prize]] in 1974, the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1975,<ref>[https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=95 National Science Foundation \u2013 The President's National Medal of Science]</ref>  an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] in 1976. The [[Mathematical Programming Society]] honored Dantzig by creating the [[George B. Dantzig Prize]], bestowed every three years since 1982 on one or two people who have made a significant impact in the field of mathematical programming.\n\nDantzig died on May 13, 2005, in his home in [[Stanford, California]], of complications from [[diabetes]] and [[cardiovascular disease]]. He was 90 years old.<ref name= \"JH05\"/>\n\n==Work==\nFreund wrote further that \"through his research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems, Dantzig contributed more than any other researcher to the remarkable development of linear programming\".<ref name=\"RF94\">Robert Freund (1994). [http://www.stanford.edu/group/SOL/dantzig.html \"Professor George Dantzig: Linear Programming Founder Turns 80\"]. In: ''SIAM News'', November 1994.</ref>\n\nDantzig's seminal work allows the airline industry, for example, to schedule crews and make fleet assignments. Based on his work tools are developed \"that shipping companies use to determine how many planes they need and where their delivery trucks should be deployed. The oil industry long has used linear programming in refinery planning, as it determines how much of its raw product should become different grades of gasoline and how much should be used for petroleum-based byproducts. It is used in manufacturing, revenue management, telecommunications, advertising, architecture, circuit design and countless other areas\".<ref name= \"JH05\"/>\n\n===Mathematical statistics===\nAn event in Dantzig's life became the origin of a famous story in 1939, while he was a graduate student at [[UC Berkeley]]. Near the beginning of a class for which Dantzig was late, professor [[Jerzy Neyman]] wrote two examples of famously unsolved [[statistics]] problems on the blackboard. When Dantzig arrived, he assumed that the two problems were a homework assignment and wrote them down. According to Dantzig, the problems \"seemed to be a little harder than usual\", but a few days later he handed in completed solutions for the two problems, still believing that they were an assignment that was overdue.<ref name=\"mmp\"/><ref name=snopes>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/college/homework/unsolvable.asp |publisher=Snopes |title=The Unsolvable Math Problem |date=June 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSix weeks later, Dantzig received a visit from an excited professor Neyman, who was eager to tell him that the homework problems he had solved were two of the most famous unsolved problems in statistics.<ref name= \"JH05\"/><ref name=\"mmp\"/> He had prepared one of Dantzig's solutions for publication in a mathematical journal.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dantzig|first1=George|title=On the non-existence of tests of \"Student's\" hypothesis having power functions independent of \u03c3|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|date=1940|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177731912|volume=11|issue=2|pages=186\u2013192}}</ref> As Dantzig told it in a 1986 interview in the ''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'':<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://rev-inv-ope.univ-paris1.fr/files/26305//IO-26305-1.pdf |title=Professor George Bernard Dantzig,  Life & Legend |first1=Sira M. |last1=Allende |first2=Carlos N. |last2=Bouza |journal=Revista Investigaci\u00f3n Operacional |year=2005 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=205\u201311}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nA year later, when I began to worry about a thesis topic, Neyman just shrugged and told me to wrap the two problems in a binder and he would accept them as my thesis.\n</blockquote>\n\nYears later another researcher, [[Abraham Wald]], was preparing to publish an article that arrived at a conclusion for the second problem, and included Dantzig as its co-author when he learned of the earlier solution.<ref name=\"mmp\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dantzig|first1=George|last2=Wald|first2=Abraham|title=On the Fundamental Lemma of Neyman and Pearson|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|date=1951|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177729695|accessdate=14 October 2014|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177729695|volume=22|pages=87\u201393}}</ref>\n\nThis story began to spread and was used as a motivational lesson demonstrating the power of positive thinking.  Over time Dantzig's name was removed, and facts were altered, but the basic story persisted in the form of an urban legend and as an introductory scene in the movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''.<ref name=snopes/>\n\n===Linear programming===\n[[Linear programming]] is a mathematical method for determining a way to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a given [[mathematical model]] for some list of requirements represented as linear relationships. Linear programming arose as a mathematical model developed during [[World War II]] to plan expenditures and returns in order to reduce costs to the army and increase losses to the enemy. It was kept secret until 1947. Postwar, many industries found its use in their daily planning.\n\nThe founders of this subject are  [[Leonid Kantorovich]], a Russian mathematician who developed linear programming problems in 1939, Dantzig, who published the [[Simplex algorithm|simplex method]] in 1947, and [[John von Neumann]], who developed the theory of the [[duality (optimization)|duality]] in the same year.\n\nDantzig's original example of finding the best assignment of 70 people to 70 jobs exemplifies the usefulness of [[linear programming]]. The computing power required to test all the permutations to select the best assignment is vast; the number of possible configurations exceeds the number of particles in the universe. However, it takes only a moment to find the optimum solution by posing the problem as a linear program and applying the Simplex algorithm. The theory behind linear programming drastically reduces the number of possible optimal solutions that must be checked.\n\nIn 1963, Dantzig\u2019s ''Linear Programming and Extensions'' was published by [[Princeton University Press]]. Rich in insight and coverage of significant topics, the book quickly became \"the bible\" of linear programming.\n\n==Publications==\nBooks by George Dantzig:\n* 1953.

They have exosporic gametophytes\u2014that is, the gametophyte is free-living and develops outside of the spore wall. Exosporic gametophytes can either be bisexual, capable of producing both sperm and eggs in the same thallus ([[monoicous]]), or specialized into separate male and female organisms (dioicous). \n\nIn [[heterospory|heterosporous]] vascular plants (plants that produce both microspores and megaspores), the gametophyte develops endosporically, within the spore wall. These gametophytes are [[dioicous]], producing either sperm or eggs but not both.\n\n==== Ferns ====\n\nIn most [[fern]]s, for example, in the [[leptosporangiate fern]]  ''[[Dryopteris]]'', the gametophyte is a [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] free living [[autotroph]]ic organism called a [[prothallium|prothallus]] that produces gametes and maintains the sporophyte during its early multicellular development. However, in some groups, notably the clade that includes [[Ophioglossaceae]] and ''[[Psilotaceae]]'', the gametophytes are subterranean and subsist by forming [[mycotroph]]ic relationships with fungi.\n\n==== Lycophytes ====\n\nExtant [[Lycopodiophyta|lycophytes]] produce two different types of gametophytes. In the families [[Lycopodiaceae]] and [[Huperziaceae]], germinating spores into free-living, subterranean and [[mycotroph]]ic, gametophytes that derive nutrients from symbiosis with fungi. In ''[[Isoetes]]'' and ''[[Selaginella]]'', which are [[heterospory|heterosporous]], the megaspore remains attached to the parent sporophyte and a highly reduced megagametophyte develops inside. At maturity, the megaspore cracks open at the trilete suture to allow the male gametes to access the egg cells in the archegonia inside. The gametophytes of ''Isoetes'' appear to be similar in this respect to those of the extinct [[Carboniferous]] giant arborescent clubmosses, ''Lepidodendron'' and ''Lepidostrobus''.<ref name=\"Brack-Hanes\">{{cite journal|first=S.D.|last=Brack-Hanes|date=1978|title=On the megagametophytes of two Lepidodendracean cones.|journal=Botanical Gazette|volume=139|pages=140\u2013146|doi=10.1086/336979}}</ref>\n\n==== Seed plants ====\nThe [[Spermatophyta|seed plants]] ([[gymnosperms]] and [[angiosperms]]) are endosporic and heterosporous. The gametophytes develop into multicellular organisms while still enclosed within the spore wall, and the megaspores are retained within the sporangium.<ref>C.Michael Hogan (2010): [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern ''Fern''.

Washington, DC</ref> \n\n==Heteromorphy==\n{{main article|Dioicous|Heterospory}}\n\nIn plants with heteromorphic gametophytes, there are two distinct kinds of gametophytes. Because the two gametophytes differ in form and function, they are termed ''heteromorphic'', from ''hetero''- \"different\" and ''morph'' \"form\". The egg producing gametophyte is known as a '''megagametophyte''', because it is typically larger, and the sperm producing gametophyte is known as a '''microgametophyte'''. Gametophytes which produce egg and sperm on separate plants are termed [[Dioicous]].\n\nIn [[Heterospory|heterosporous]] plants (water ferns, some lycophytes, as well as all gymnosperms and angiosperms), there are two distinct [[sporangium|sporangia]], each of which produces a single kind of spore and single kind of gametophyte. However, not all heteromorphic gametophytes come from heterosporous plants. That is, some plants have distinct egg-producing and sperm-producing gametophytes, but these gametophytes develop from the same kind of spore inside the same sporangium; ''[[Sphaerocarpos]]'' is an example of such a plant.\n\nIn the seed plants, the microgametophyte is called [[pollen]]. Seed plant microgametophytes consists of two or three cells when the pollen grains exit the sporangium. The megagametophyte develops within the megaspore of extant seedless vascular plants and within the megasporangium in a cone or flower in seed plants. In seed plants, the microgametophyte (pollen grain) travels to the vicinity of the egg cell (carried by a physical or animal vector), and produces two sperm by mitosis.\n\nIn [[gymnosperm]]s the megagametophyte consists of several thousand cells and produces one to several [[archegonia]], each with a single egg cell. The gametophyte becomes a food storage tissue in the seed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digimuse.nmns.edu.tw/Default.aspx?Domin=b&tabid=268&Field=v0&ContentType=Study&FieldName=&ObjectId=&Subject=&Language=ENG |title=Vascular Plants :: Description |publisher=Digimuse.nmns.edu.tw |date= |accessdate=2014-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522044106/http://digimuse.nmns.edu.tw/Default.aspx?Domin=b&tabid=268&Field=v0&ContentType=Study&FieldName=&ObjectId=&Subject=&Language=ENG |archivedate=2014-05-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn [[angiosperm]]s, the megagametophyte is reduced to only a few nuclei and cells, and is sometimes called the [[embryo sac]]. A typical embryo sac contains seven cells and eight nuclei, one of which is the egg cell. Two nuclei fuse with a sperm nucleus to form [[endosperm]], which becomes the food storage tissue in the seed.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sporophyte]]\n*[[Alternation of generations]]\n*[[Archegonium]]\n*[[Antheridium]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Botany}}\n\n[[Category:Plant morphology]]\n[[Category:Plant anatomy]]\n[[Category:Plant reproduction]]", "sha1": "4m8s1ubbnxd41l3v3251pp7d14ltbxn"}}, {"title": "Gavoi", "ns": "0", "id": "13116", "revision": {"id": "825608531", "parentid": "818784821", "timestamp": "2018-02-14T10:40:29Z", "contributor": {"username": "Attilios", "id": "428795"}, "comment": "sthg", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2018}}\n{{Infobox Italian comune\n| name                = Gavoi\n| official_name       = Comune di Gavoi\n| native_name         = \n| image_skyline       = Gavoi.jpg\n| imagesize           = \n| image_alt           = \n| image_caption       = \n| image_shield        = Gavoi-Stemma.png\n| shield_alt          = \n| image_map           = \n| map_alt             = \n| map_caption         = \n| pushpin_map         = Italy Sardinia\n| coordinates         = {{coord|40|10|N|09|12|E|display=inline,title}}\n| coordinates_footnotes = \n| region              = [[Sardinia]]\n| province            = [[Province of Nuoro|Nuoro]] (NU)\n| frazioni            = \n| mayor_party         = \n| mayor               = Giovanni Cugusi\n| area_footnotes      = \n| area_total_km2      = 38.06\n| population_footnotes = \n| population_total    = 2648\n| population_as_of    = 31 August 2017\n| pop_density_footnotes = \n| population_demonym  = Gavoesi\n| elevation_footnotes = \n| elevation_m         = 777\n| saint               = \n| day                 = \n| postal_code         = 08020\n| area_code           = 0784\n| footnotes           = \n}}\n'''Gavoi''' is a ''[[comune]]'' in central [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]), part of the [[province of Nuoro]], in the natural region of [[Barbagia]].

The village's center contains rock houses with balconies, and a village fountain is known as \"Antana 'e [[Cartzonna]]\".\n\nNear the lake are the archaeological areas of Orrui and San Michele di [[Fonni]]. A [[Roman bridge]] is submerged beneath the lake.\n\n==Economy==\nMountain tourism is among the sources of income. Agriculture production include potatoes and cheese (the town is famous for its [[pecorino]]).\n\n==Traditions and culture==\nThe \"[[tumbarinu]]\" is a traditional drum made of lamb skin, and more rarely, dog or donkey skin. The tumbarinu is often accompanied with the pipiolu, the traditional sheppard's fife. The \"[[ballu tundu]]\", is a traditional dance in the round, as in the [[Balkan]] area. Poetry is esteemed, including extemporaneous  rhyme competitions on given topics.\n\nThe nearby Sanctuary of Madonna d'Itria hosts a [[palio]], in this case a peculiar horse competition very similar to that of [[Siena]]. \n{{commons category|Gavoi}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<BR>\n{{Province of Nuoro}}\n\n\n{{Sardinia-geo-stub}}", "sha1": "q30jsn6i9reqwox3dijlxmsb14dfv80"}}, {"title": "Gusana", "ns": "0", "id": "13117", "revision": {"id": "854100668", "parentid": "765628394", "timestamp": "2018-08-09T00:01:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "Piterkeo", "id": "12566854"}, "comment": "added link to the land planarian genus Gusana", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n{{About|a lake in Italy|the planarian genus|Gusana (genus)}}\n{{Infobox lake\n| name = Lago di Gusana\n| image = Gusana.jpg\n| caption = \n| image_bathymetry = \n| caption_bathymetry = \n| location = [[Gavoi]], [[Sardinia]]\n| coords = {{Coord|40.13177|N|9.20448|E|region:IT_type:waterbody|display=inline,title}}\n| lake_type= [[artificial lake]]\n| inflow = \n| outflow = \n| catchment = \n| basin_countries = Italy\n| length = \n| width = \n| area = {{convert|2|km2|abbr=on}}\n| depth = \n| max-depth = {{convert|79.5|m|abbr=on}}\n| volume = {{convert|58|km3|e6acre.ft|abbr=on}}\n| residence_time = \n| shore = \n| elevation = \n| islands = \n| cities = \n}}\n'''Gusana''' is the name of an artificial [[lake]] and of the surrounding area, in the territory of [[Gavoi]], [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]].\n\nThe lake was built in the 1930s to store water for an electricity generator (central of Coghinadordza), and it covered an ancient [[Roman bridge]] as well as an ancient archaeological site of the [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragici people]].\n\nIt is now a [[tourist destination]].\n\n[[File:Gavoi - Lago di Gusana (02).JPG|thumb|none|Lake Gusana]]\n\n[[Category:Lakes of Sardinia]]\n\n\n{{Sardinia-geo-stub}}", "sha1": "ot7pne2tr39lvrmw5md5bzeq49iigjm"}}, {"title": "Grazia Deledda", "ns": "0", "id": "13118", "revision": {"id": "866580595", "parentid": "864084998", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T06:27:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Caroca2", "id": "31756405"}, "comment": "/* External links */ pm20", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2013}}\n{{Infobox writer\n| name        = Grazia Deledda\n| awards      = {{awd|[[Nobel Prize in Literature]]|1926}}\n| image       = Grazia Deledda 1926.jpg\n| caption = Deledda in 1926, from the Nobel Prize website\n| birth_date  = {{birth date|1871|9|28|df=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Nuoro]], Italy\n| death_date  = {{death date and age|1936|8|15|1871|9|28|df=y}}\n| death_place = Rome, Italy\n| nationality = Italian\n| occupation  = Writer, [[novelist]]\n| movement    = [[Literary realism|Realism]], [[Decadent movement|Decadence]]\n| signature   = Deledda - Marianna Sirca, 1915 (page 7 crop).jpg\n}}\n\n'''Grazia Maria Cosima Damiana Deledda''' ({{IPA-it|\u02c8\u0261rattsja de\u02c8l\u025bdda}}; {{IPA-srd|de\u02c8l\u025b\u0256\u0256a|lang}}; 28 September 1871 \u2013 15 August 1936) was an [[Italy|Italian]] writer who received the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1926<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/156461/Grazia-Deledda Grazia Deledda (Italian author)]. britannica.com</ref> \"for her idealistically inspired writings which with plastic clarity picture the life on her native island [i.e. [[Sardinia]]] and with depth and sympathy deal with human problems in general\".<ref>https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1926/press.html Award speech, apparently citing the Swedish Academy.</ref>  She was the first Italian woman to receive the prize.<ref name=\"hallengren1926\">{{cite web|last=Hallengren|first=Anders|title=Grazia Deledda: Voice of Sardinia|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1926/deledda-article.html|publisher=Nobel Media|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Nuoro]], [[Sardinia]], into a middle-class family, she attended elementary school and then was educated by a private tutor (a guest of one of her relatives) and moved on to study literature on her own.  She started writing at a very young age,{{vague|date=December 2017}} inspired by the Sardinian peasants and their struggles.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThe first novel she wrote and published was ''Fiori di Sardegna'' (Flowers of Sardinia). This novel was published in 1892. She first published some pieces in the fashion magazine ''L'ultima moda'' when it still published works in prose and poetry. ''Nell'azzurro'', published by Trevisani in 1890, might be considered her first work. Her family was not supportive of her desire to write. Her works seemed to focus on portraying harsh realities and difficult lifestyles, combining imaginary and autobiographical elements.  Her novels tend to criticize social values and moral norms rather than the people who are victims of such circumstances.\n\nStill between prose and poetry are, among the first works, ''Paesaggi sardi'', published by Speirani in 1896. In 1900, after having married Palmiro Madesani, a functionary of the Ministry of War whom she met in [[Cagliari]] in October 1899, the writer moved to Rome and after the publication of ''Anime oneste'' in 1895 and of ''Il vecchio della montagna'' in 1900, plus the collaboration with magazines ''La Sardegna'', ''Piccola rivista'' and ''Nuova Antologia'', her work began to gain critical interest. She had two sons and lived a quiet life occupied by her writing.<ref name=\"russell1994\">Migiel, Marilyn. \"Grazia Deledda.\" Italian Women Writers: A Bio-bibliographical Sourcebook. By Rinaldina Russell. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1994. 111-117. Print.</ref> She was a very prolific writer publishing, on average, a novel a year.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/>\n[[File:Grazia Deledda.jpg|thumb|250px|left|With her husband and son, Rome circa 1905]]\nIn 1903 she published her first real success, ''Elias Portolu'' that confirmed her as a writer and started her work as a successful [[writer of novels]] and theatrical works:'' Cenere'' (1904), ''[[L'edera (novel)|L'edera]]'' (1908), ''Sino al confine'' (1910), ''Colombi e sparvieri'' (1912), ''Canne al vento'' (1913) -her most well known book in Italy-, ''L'incendio nell'oliveto'' (1918), ''Il Dio dei venti'' (1922).\n\n''[[Cenere]]'' was the inspiration for a silent movie with the famous Italian actress [[Eleonora Duse]]. It was the only time Duse appeared in film.\n\nDeledda received the Nobel Prize in 1926 in Literature after she had been nominated by [[Henrik Sch\u00fcck]], member of the [[Swedish Academy]].<ref>https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=7586</ref>  Her response in winning the prize was Gi\u00e0! (Already!) Deledda was very protective of her daily writing routine. Her schedule was exactly the same seven days a week: a late breakfast, a few hours of reading, lunch followed by a nap and then, clearly, ending the day with a few hours of writing.\nDeledda happened to receive the Nobel Prize almost exactly a year after Benito Mussolini dropped the charade of constitutional rule of the favor of Fascism.  Mussolini himself wished to give Grazia a portrait of himself, and he signed it with \u201cprofound admiration.\u201d\nWith this string of fame, came a slew of journalists and notable photographers whom she allowed into her home to learn more about her.  Her beloved pet crow, Checcha was irritated by all the commotion with people coming in and out. \u201cIf Checcha has had enough, so have I,\u201d Deledda was quoted as saying.\n\nDeledda continued to write even as she grew older and weaker. \"La Casa del Poeta\" and \"Sole d'Estate\" are two of the collections of short stories she wrote during this time. She showcased her optimistic view of life even as she suffered from painful illnesses. She believed that life was beautiful and serene, unaltered by personal suffering; man and nature are reconciled in order to overcome physical and spiritual hardships. Her later works show how mankind and faith in God are beautiful things.\n\nShe died in Rome at the age of 64 of breast cancer. ''La chiesa della solitudine'' (1936), Deledda's last novel, is a semi-autobiographical depiction of a young Italian woman coming to terms with her breast cancer. A completed manuscript of the novel \"[[Cosima (Grazia Deledda novel)|Cosima]]\" (1937) was discovered after her death and published posthumously.<ref name=\"hallengren1926\"/>\n\nHer work has been highly regarded by [[Luigi Capuana]] and [[Giovanni Verga]] as well as some lesser known writers and critics such as {{ill|Enrico Thovez|it}}, {{ill|Pietro Pancrazi|it}} and {{ill|Renato Serra|it}}; also by Sardinian writers such as [[Sergio Atzeni]], [[Giulio Angioni]] and  [[Salvatore Mannuzzu]], the founders of what has become known as the [[Sardinian Literary Spring]].\n[[File:Pincio - busti - Deledda P1080984.jpg|thumb|200px|Bust of Deledda by {{ill|Amelia Camboni|it}}, Rome ([[Pincio]])]]\n\n==Work==\nThe life, customs, and traditions of the [[Sardinian people]] are prominent in her writing.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/> She relies heavily on geographical description and details and her work is most often concerned with transgressions.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/> Many of her characters are social outcasts that struggle in silence and isolation.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/> Deledda's whole work is based on strong facts of love, [[pain]] and death upon which rests the feeling of [[sin]] and of an inevitable fatality.\n\nIn her works we can recognize the influence of the [[verism]] of [[Giovanni Verga]] and, sometimes, also that of the [[decadentism]] by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].\n\nIn Deledda's novels there is always a strong connection between places and people, feelings and [[social environment|environment]]. The environment depicted is mostly that one harsh of native [[Sardinia]], but it is not depicted according to regional veristic schemes neither according to the otherworldly vision by D'Annunzio, but relived through the myth.\n\nDeledda has not gained much recognition as a feminist writer potentially due to her themes of women\u2019s pain and suffering as opposed to women\u2019s autonomy.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/>\n\n== Museum ==\nDeledda's birthplace and childhood home in [[Nuoro]] has been preserved as a museum in her honor (the Museo Deleddiano). The museum consists of 10 rooms where the stages of the writer's life are reconstructed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Museo Deleddiano di Nuoro|url=http://news.fidelityhouse.eu/viaggi/museo-deleddiano-nuoro-66734.html|website=Fidelity House|accessdate=24 May 2016|date=5 February 2015|language=Italian}}</ref>\n\n==Complete list of works==\nBelow is a complete list of Deledda's works:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/efts/textdbs/iww/editionidx.pl?edition_auth_codes=A0014|title=IWW Results|work=uchicago.edu}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[Stella d'Oriente]]'' (1890)\n* ''[[Nell'azzuro]]'' (1890)\n* ''[[Fior di Sardegna]]'' (1891)\n* ''[[Racconti sardi]]'' (1894)\n* ''[[Tradizioni popolari di Nuoro in Sardegna]]'' (1894)\n* ''[[La via del male]]'' (1896)\n* ''[[Anime oneste]]'' (1895)\n* ''[[Paesaggi sardi]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[La tentazioni]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Il tesoro]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[L'ospite (novel)|L'ospite]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[La giustizia]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Nostra Signora del buon consiglio: leggenda sarda]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Le disgrazie che pu\u00f2 causare il denaro]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Il Vecchio della montagna]]'' (1900)\n* ''Dopo il divorzio'' (1902; English translation: ''[[After the divorce]]'', 1995)\n* ''[[La regina delle tenebre]]'' (1902)\n* ''[[Elias Portolu]]'' (1900)\n* ''[[Cenere (novel)|Cenere]]'' (1904; English translation: ''[[Ashes (novel)|Ashes]]'', 1908)\n* ''[[Odio Vince]]'' (1904)\n* ''[[Nostalgie (novel)|Nostalgie]]'' (1905)\n* ''[[I giuochi della vita]]'' (1905)\n* ''[[L'ombra del passato]]'' (1907)\n* ''[[Amori moderni]]'' (1907)\n* ''[[L'edera-romanzo (novel)|L'edera]]'' (1908)\n* ''[[Il nonno]]'' (1908)\n* ''[[Il nostro padrone]]'' (1910)\n* ''[[Sino al confine]]'' (1910)\n* ''[[Nel deserto]]'' (1911)\n* ''[[L'edera: dramma in tre atti]]'' (1912)\n* ''[[Colombi e sparvieri]]'' (1912)\n* ''[[Chiaroscuro (novel)|Chiaroscuro]]'' (1912)\n* ''[[Canne al vento]]'' (1913), ''[[Reeds in the Wind]]'' (1999 [http://www.italicapress.com/index119.html English translation] by Martha King)\n* ''[[Le colpe altrui]]'' (1914)\n* ''[[Marianna Sirca]]'' (1915)\n* ''[[Il fanciullo nascosto]]'' (1915)\n* ''[[L'incendio nell'oliveto]]'' (1918)\n* ''[[Il ritorno del figlio]]'' (1919)\n* ''[[Naufraghi in porto]]'' (1920)\n* ''La madre'' (1920; English translation: ''[[The Woman and the Priest]]'', 1922; English translation: ''[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/deledda/mother/mother.html The Mother]'', by Mary G.

Truman]] to [[Bill Clinton]]{{spaced ndash}}on nuclear policy and was Chairman of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1961 to 1971, where he pushed for commercial [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and the peaceful applications of nuclear science. Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the [[Franck Report]] and contributed to the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]], the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the [[Eisenhower administration]], he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]], he was a key contributor to its 1983 report \"[[A Nation at Risk]]\".\n\nSeaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: [[plutonium]], [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], [[californium]], [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[mendelevium]], [[nobelium]] and element 106, which, while he was still living, was named [[seaborgium]] in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 atomic [[isotope]]s and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the [[Manhattan Project]] where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the [[Fat Man|second atomic bomb]]. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in [[nuclear medicine]] and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including [[iodine-131]], which is used in the treatment of [[thyroid]] disease. In addition to his theoretical work in the development of the actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the [[lanthanide]] series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the [[transactinide]] and [[superactinide]] series.\n\nAfter sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with [[Edwin McMillan]], he received approximately 50 honorary doctorates and numerous other [[Glenn T.

He had one sister, Jeanette, who was two years younger. His family spoke Swedish at home. When Glenn Seaborg was a boy, the family moved to [[Los Angeles County, California]], settling in a subdivision called [[Seaborg Home (South Gate, California)|Home Gardens]], later annexed to the City of [[South Gate, California]]. About this time he changed the spelling of his first name from Glen to Glenn.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }}\n\nSeaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 until he suffered a stroke in 1998.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=336 }} As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged him to become a bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical.

Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, [[John Livingood]], Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, [[iron-59]] in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the [[hemoglobin]] in human blood.

Seaborg's role was to figure out how to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of [[uranium]]. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory.

Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household [[smoke detectors]] and thus provided a good source of royalty income to Seaborg in later years.

California Governor [[Pete Wilson]] appointed Seaborg to head a committee that proposed changes to California's science curriculum despite outcries from labor organizations and others.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=193\u2013194}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Helen and Glenn Seaborg 1951.jpg|thumb|left|Helen and Glenn Seaborg in Stockholm in 1951]]\nIn 1942, Seaborg married [[Helen L. Seaborg|Helen Griggs]], the secretary of physicist [[Ernest Lawrence]]. Under wartime pressure, Seaborg had moved to Chicago while engaged to Griggs. When Seaborg returned to accompany Griggs for the journey back to Chicago, friends expected them to marry in Chicago. But, eager to be married, Seaborg and Griggs impulsively got off the train in the town of [[Caliente, Nevada]], for what they thought would be a quick wedding. When they asked for City Hall, they found Caliente had none\u2014they would have to travel {{convert|25|mi}} north to [[Pioche, Nevada|Pioche]], the [[county seat]]. With no car, this was no easy feat, but one of Caliente's newest deputy sheriffs turned out to be a recent graduate of the Cal Berkeley chemistry department and was more than happy to do a favor for Seaborg. The deputy sheriff arranged for the wedding couple to ride up and back to Pioche in a mail truck. The witnesses at the Seaborg wedding were a clerk and a janitor.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=79\u201385}} Glenn Seaborg and Helen Griggs Seaborg had seven children, of whom the first, Peter Glenn Seaborg, died in 1997 (his twin Paulette having died in infancy).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.lbl.gov/today/2006/Sep/05-Tue/Seaborg-obit.html|title=Today at Berkeley Lab: Seaborg Family Remembers: Helen 'a Mixture of Efficiency and Diplomacy'|website=www2.lbl.gov|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref> The others were Lynne Seaborg Cobb, [[David Seaborg]], Steve Seaborg, Eric Seaborg, and Dianne Seaborg.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=332 }}\n\nSeaborg was an avid hiker. Upon becoming Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1961, he commenced taking daily hikes through a trail that he blazed at the headquarters site in [[Germantown, Maryland]]. He frequently invited colleagues and visitors to accompany him, and the trail became known as the \"Glenn Seaborg Trail.\" He and his wife Helen are credited with blazing a {{convert|12|mi|km|adj=on}} trail in the East Bay area near their home in Lafayette, California. This trail has since become a part of the American Hiking Association's cross-country network of trails.

In this period, the correct expression for [[kinetic energy]], ''\u00bdmv<sup>2</sup>'', and its relation to [[mechanical work]], became established.\n\nDuring the following years, Coriolis worked to extend the notions of kinetic energy and work to rotating systems.<ref name=Gillespie>{{cite book |title=Science and Polity in France: The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Years |page= 693 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k07JbSAa6wQC&pg=PA522&lpg=PA522&dq=%22%C3%89cole+des+Ponts+and+Chauss%C3%A9es%22 |author=Charles Coulston Gillispie |isbn=0-691-11541-9 |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2004}}</ref> The first of his papers, ''Sur le principe des forces vives dans les mouvements relatifs des machines'' (On the principle of kinetic energy in the relative motion in machines),<ref name=machines>{{cite journal |journal=J.

Alternatively, a ''gameshow'' can be a demonstrative program about a game [while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony]. In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and [[goods and services]] provided by the show's [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] prize suppliers.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Game Show.jpg|thumb|Game show]]\n\n===1930s\u20131950s===\nTelevision game shows descended from similar programs on radio. The very first television game show, ''[[Spelling Bee (game show)|Spelling Bee]]'', was broadcast in 1938. ''[[Truth or Consequences]]'' was the first game show to air on commercially licensed television.  Its first episode  aired in 1941 as an experimental broadcast. Over the course of the 1950s, as television began to pervade the popular culture, game shows quickly became a fixture. Daytime game shows would be played for lower stakes to target stay-at-home housewives.  Higher-stakes programs would air in [[primetime]]. During the late 1950s, high-stakes games such as ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' and ''[[The $64,000 Question]]''  began a rapid rise in popularity.  However, the rise of quiz shows proved to be short-lived.  In 1959, many of the higher stakes game shows were [[quiz show scandals|discovered to be rigged]] and ratings declines led to most of the primetime games being canceled.\n\nAn early variant of the game show, the [[panel game]], survived the quiz show scandals. On shows like ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[I've Got A Secret]]'', and ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', panels of celebrities would interview a guest in an effort to determine some fact about them; in others, celebrities would answer questions. Panel games had success in primetime until the late 1960s, when they were collectively dropped from television because of their perceived low budget nature. Panel games made a comeback in American daytime television (where the lower budgets were tolerated) in the 1970s through comedy-driven shows such as ''[[Match Game]]'' and ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''. In the UK, commercial demographic pressures were not as prominent, and restrictions on game shows made in the wake of the scandals limited the style of games that could be played and the amount of money that could be awarded. Panel shows there were kept in primetime and have continued to thrive; they have transformed into showcases for the nation's top stand-up comedians on shows such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to You?]]'', ''[[Mock the Week]]'', ''[[QI]]'', and ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]'', all of which put a heavy emphasis on comedy, leaving the points as mere formalities. The focus on quick-witted comedians has resulted in strong ratings, which, combined with low costs of production, have only spurred growth in the UK panel show phenomenon.\n\n===1960s\u20131970s===\nGame shows remained a fixture of US daytime television through the 1960s after the quiz show scandals. Lower-stakes games made a slight comeback in daytime in the early 1960s; examples include ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' which began in 1964 and the original version of ''The Match Game'' first aired in 1962.  ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]''  began in 1963 and the 1960s also marked the debut of ''Hollywood Squares'', ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', and ''[[The Newlywed Game]]''.\n\nThough [[CBS]] gave up on daytime game shows in 1968, the other networks did not follow suit. [[Color television]] was introduced to the game show genre in the late 1960s on all three networks. The 1970s saw a renaissance of the game show as new games and massive upgrades to existing games made debuts on the major networks. ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The New Price Is Right]]'', an update of the 1950s-era game show ''[[The Price Is Right (1956 U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', debuted in 1972 and marked CBS's return to the game show format in its [[rural purge|effort to draw wealthier, suburban viewers]]. ''The Match Game'' became \"Big Money\" ''[[Match Game]] 73'', which proved popular enough to prompt a spin-off, ''[[Family Feud]]'', on ABC in 1976. ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10,000 Pyramid]]'' and its numerous higher-stakes derivatives also debuted in 1973, while the 1970s also saw the return of formerly disgraced producer and [[game show host|host]] [[Jack Barry (television personality)|Jack Barry]], who debuted ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'' and a clean version of the previously rigged ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]]'' in the 1970s. ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' debuted on NBC in 1975. The [[Prime Time Access Rule]], which took effect in 1971, barred networks from broadcasting in the 7-8 p.m. time slot immediately preceding [[prime time]], opening up time slots for [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming. Most of the syndicated programs were \"nighttime\" adaptations of network daytime game shows. These game shows originally aired once a week, but by the late 1970s and early 1980s most of the games had transitioned to five days a week.\n\n===1980s\u20131990s===\nGame shows were the lowest priority of television networks and were rotated out every thirteen weeks if unsuccessful. Most tapes were [[wiping#Game shows|destroyed]] until the early 1980s. Over the course of the late 1980s and early 1990s, as fewer new hits were produced, game shows lost their permanent place in the daytime lineup. ABC transitioned out of the daytime game show format in the mid-1980s (briefly returning to the format for one season in 1990 with a ''Match Game'' revival). NBC's game block also lasted until 1991, but the network attempted to bring them back in 1993 before cancelling its game show block again in 1994. CBS phased out most of its game shows, except for ''The Price Is Right'', by 1993. To the benefit of the genre, the moves of ''Wheel of Fortune'' and a modernized revival of ''Jeopardy!'' to [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] in 1983 and 1984, respectively, was and remains highly successful; the two are, to this day, fixtures in the prime time \"access period\".\n\n[[Cable television]] also allowed for the debut of game shows such as ''[[Supermarket Sweep]]'' (Lifetime), ''[[Trivial Pursuit (US game show)|Trivial Pursuit]]'' and ''[[Family Challenge]]'' (Family Channel), and ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]'' (Nickelodeon). It also opened up a previously underdeveloped market for game show reruns. General interest networks such as [[Television networks preceding ABC Family|CBN Cable Network]] and [[USA Network]] had popular blocks for game show reruns from the mid-1980s to the mid-'90s before that [[niche market|niche]] was overtaken by [[Game Show Network]] in 1994.\n\nAfter the popularity of game shows hit a nadir in the mid-1990s United States (at which point ''The Price Is Right'' was the only game show still on daytime network TV), the British game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' began distribution across the globe. Upon the show's American debut in 1999, it was a hit and became a regular part of ABC's prime time lineup until 2002. Several shorter-lived high-stakes games were attempted around the time of the [[millennium]], both in the United States and the United Kingdom, such as ''[[Winning Lines]]'', ''[[The Chair (game show)|The Chair]]'', ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', and ''[[Shafted]]'', leading to some dubbing this period as \"The Million-Dollar Game Show Craze\". These higher stakes contests also opened the door to [[reality television]] contests such as ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', in which contestants win large sums of money for outlasting their peers in a given environment. Several game shows returned to daytime in syndication during this time as well, such as ''Family Feud'', ''Hollywood Squares'', and ''Millionaire''.\n\nThe popularity of game shows in the United States was closely paralleled around the world. [[Reg Grundy Organisation]], for instance, would buy the international rights for American game shows and reproduce them in other countries, especially in Grundy's native [[Australia]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], game shows have had a more steady and permanent place in the television lineup and never lost popularity in the 1990s as they did in the United States, due in part to the fact that game shows were highly regulated by the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] in the 1980s and that those restrictions were lifted in the 1990s, allowing for higher-stakes games to be played. Game shows have had an inconsistent place in [[Television in Canada|Canadian television]], with most homegrown game shows there being made for the French-speaking [[Quebec]]ois market and the majority of English-language game shows in the country being rebroadcast from, or made with the express intent of export to, the United States. There have been exceptions to this (see, for instance, the long-running ''[[Definition (TV series)|Definition]]''). Unlike [[reality television]] franchises, international game show franchises generally only see Canadian adaptations in a series of specials, based heavily on the American versions but usually with a Canadian host to allow for [[Canadian content]] credits. The smaller markets and lower revenue opportunities for Canadian shows in general also affect game shows there, with Canadian games (especially Quebecois ones) often having very low budgets for prizes, unless the series is made for export. Canadian contestants are generally allowed to participate on American game shows, and there have been at least three Canadian game show hosts \u2013 [[Monty Hall]], [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]], and [[Alex Trebek]] \u2013 who have gone on to long careers hosting American series.\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\nIn the U.S., CBS is currently the only major network airing daily national game shows. It still airs ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and, as of 2009, is also airing a revival of ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]''. ''Deal'' airs on weekdays at a time chosen by each CBS affiliate, while ''Price'' airs weekdays at 10 am or 11 am in most markets.  In addition, ABC's syndication wing [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] distributes ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', and many of their local affiliates air it in syndication. The oldest, continually aired radio quiz show in the United States was ''Simply Trivia'', which aired on public radio station [[WYSO]] in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]. It ran from 1972 through 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyso.org/programs/simply-trivia|title=Programs A-Z|work=wyso.org}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of digital television in the United States opened up a large market for rerun programs. [[Buzzr]] was established by [[FremantleMedia North America]], owners of numerous classic U.S. game shows, as a broadcast outlet for its archived holdings in June 2015. There has also been a rise of live game shows at festivals and public venues, where the general audience can participate in the show, such as the science-inspired [http://www.philasciencefestival.org/event/269-geek-out-game-show ''Geek Out Game Show''] or the [http://www.yuckshow.com/ ''Yuck Show''].\n\nA boom in [[prime time]] revivals of classic daytime game shows began to emerge in the mid-2010s. In 2016, ABC packaged the existing  ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'', which had returned in 2015, with new versions of ''[[To Tell the Truth]],'' ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $100,000 Pyramid]]'', and ''[[Match Game]]'' in 2016. [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], in turn, launched a [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]-themed revival of ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', hosted by [[Snoop Dogg]], in October 2017. This is in addition to a number of original game concepts that appeared near the same time, including ''[[The Million Second Quiz]]'', ''[[Hollywood Game Night]]'', ''[[1 vs. 100]]'', and ''[[The Wall (game show)|The Wall]]'', and a string of music-themed games such as ''[[Don't Forget the Lyrics!]]'', ''[[The Singing Bee (U.S. game show)|The Singing Bee]]'', and ''[[Beat Shazam]]''.\n\n==Prizes==\nMany of the prizes awarded on game shows are provided through [[product placement]], but in some cases they are provided by private organizations or purchased at either the full price or at a discount by the show. There is the widespread use of \"promotional consideration\", in which a game show receives a subsidy from an advertiser in return for awarding that manufacturer's product as a prize or [[consolation prize]]. Some products supplied by manufacturers may not be intended to be awarded at all and are instead just used as part of the gameplay (such as the low-priced items used in several [[List of The Price Is Right pricing games|pricing games]] of ''[[The Price Is Right]]'').\n\nFor high-stakes games, a network may purchase [[prize indemnity insurance]] to avoid paying the cost of a rare but expensive prize out of pocket. If the said prize is won too often, the insurance company may refuse to insure a show. (This was a factor in the discontinuation of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular]]'' series of prime-time specials.) In 2008, three of the contestants on ''The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular'' won the top prize in a five-episode span after fifteen episodes without a winner, due in large part to a change in the rules. The insurance companies had made it extremely difficult to get further insurance for the remaining episodes. A network or syndicator may also opt to distribute large cash prizes in the form of an [[annuity (finance theory)|annuity]], spreading the cost of the prize out over several years or decades.\n\nFrom about 1960 through the rest of the 20th century, American networks placed restrictions on the amount of money that could be given away on a game show, in an effort to avoid a repeat of the scandals of the 1950s. This usually took the form of an earnings cap that forced a player to retire once they had won a certain amount of money or a limit on how many episodes, usually five, on which a player could appear on a show. The introduction of [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] games, particularly in the 1980s, eventually allowed for more valuable prizes and extended runs on a particular show. British television was under even stricter regulations on prizes until the 1990s, seriously restricting the value of prizes that could be given and disallowing games of chance to have an influence on the results of the game. (Thus, the British version of ''[[The Price Is Right (UK game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' at first did not include the American version's \"Showcase Showdown\", in which contestants spun a large wheel to determine who would advance to the Showcase bonus round.) In Canada, prizes were limited not by bureaucracy but necessity, as the much smaller population limited the audience of shows marketed toward that country. The lifting of these restrictions in the 1990s was a major factor in the explosion of high-stakes game shows in the later part of that decade in both the U.S. and Britain and, subsequently, around the world.\n\n==Bonus round==\nA bonus round (also known as a bonus game or an end game) usually follows a main game as a bonus to the winner of that game. In the bonus round, the stakes are higher and the game is considered to be tougher.<ref name=\"Graham\">Graham, Jefferson, \"Come On Down!!! The TV Game Show Book,\" Abbeville Press Publishers, New York, 1988.</ref>\n\nThe game play of a bonus round usually varies from the standard game play of the front game, and there are often borrowed or related elements of the main game in the bonus round to ensure the entire show has a unified premise. Though some end games are referred to as \"bonus rounds\", many are not specifically referred to as such in games but fit the same general role.\n\nThere is no one formula for the format of a bonus round. There are differences in almost every bonus round, though there are many recurring elements from show to show. The bonus round is often played for the show's top prize.\n\nUntil the 1960s, most game shows did not offer a bonus round. In traditional two-player formats, the winner \u2014 if a game show's rules provided for this \u2014 became the champion and simply played a new challenger either on the next show or after the commercial break.<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\nOne of the earliest forms of bonus rounds was the Jackpot Round of the original series ''[[Beat the Clock]]''. After two rounds of performing stunts, the wife of the contestant couple would perform at a jackpot board for a prize. The contestant was shown a famous quotation or common phrase, and the words were scrambled. To win the announced bonus, the contestant had to unscramble the words within 20 seconds. The contestant received a consolation gift worth over $200 if she was unsuccessful.\n\nAnother early bonus round ended each episode of ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' with the team who won the most money answering one final question for a jackpot which started at $1,000 and increased $500 each week until won.\n\nAnother early example was the Lightning Round on the word game ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', starting in 1961. The contestant who won the front game played a quick-fire series of passwords within 60 seconds, netting $50 per correctly guessed word, for a maximum bonus prize of $250.<ref name=\"Graham\"/><ref>Schwartz, David, Steve Ryan and Fred Westbock. \"The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows: 3rd Edition\", Checkmark Books, Facts on File Inc., 1999, pg. xviii. {{ISBN|0-8160-3847-3}}</ref>\n\nThe bonus round came about after game show producer [[Mark Goodson]] was first presented ''Password'', contending that it was not enough to merely guess passwords during the show. \"We needed something more, and that's how the Lightning Round was invited,\" said [[Howard Felsher]], who produced ''Password'' and ''[[Family Feud]]''. \"From that point on every game show had to have an end round. You'd bring a show to a network and they'd say, 'What's the endgame?' as if they had thought of it themselves.\"<ref>Graham, p. 54.</ref>\n\nThe end game of ''[[Match Game]]'', hosted for most of its run by [[Gene Rayburn]], served as the impetus for a completely new game show.

Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily [[Guitar distortion|distorted]], [[Guitar tunings#Dropped tunings|down-tuned guitars]], grinding [[overdriven bass]], high speed [[tempo]], [[blast beat]]s, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like [[Napalm Death]] are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as [[Brutal Truth]] and [[Nasum]]. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.\n\nA trait of grindcore is the \"microsong\". Several bands have produced songs that are only seconds in length.<ref>Metal: The Definitive Guide (Garry Sharpe-Young), US Death Metal and Grindcore</ref> British band Napalm Death holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for shortest song ever recorded with the one-second \"[[You Suffer]]\" (1987). Many bands, such as [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]], record simple phrases that may be rhythmically sprawled out across an instrumental lasting only a couple of [[Bar (music)|bars]] in length.\n\nA variety of [[microgenre]]s have subsequently emerged, often labeling bands according to traits that deviate from regular grindcore, including [[goregrind]], focused on themes of gore (e.g. mutilation and pathology), and [[pornogrind]], fixated on [[pornographic]] lyrical themes. Another offshoot is electrogrind (or cybergrind) which incorporates [[electronic music]] elements such as sampling and programmed drums. Although influential within hardcore and extreme metal, grindcore remains an underground form of music.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nGrindcore evolved as a blend of [[thrash metal]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/grindcore-ma0000004452|title=Grindcore Music Genre Overview - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref> [[thrashcore]]<ref name=\"Glasper 2009, p. 11\"/> and [[hardcore punk]].  The name derives from the fact that ''grind'' is a British term for ''thrash''; that term was appended to ''-core'' from ''hardcore''.<ref>{{Cite book | first1=Pete | last1=Prown | first2=Harvey P. | last2=Newquist | title=Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists | chapter=Chapter Thirty-three: Industrial and Grindcore | page=249 | year=1997 | publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation | isbn=978-0793540426}}</ref>  Grindcore relies on standard hardcore punk instrumentation: [[electric guitar]], [[Bass guitar|bass]] and [[Drum kit|drums]].<ref name=amg/> However, grindcore alters the usual practices of metal or rock music in regard to song structure and tone.<ref name=amg/> The vocal style is \"ranging from high-pitched shrieks to low, throat-shredding [[death growl|growls]] and barks.\"<ref name=amg/> In some cases, no clear lyrics exist. Vocals may be used as merely an added sound effect, a common practice with bands such as the experimental [[Naked City (band)|Naked City]].\n\nA characteristic of some grindcore songs is the \"microsong,\" lasting only a few seconds. In 2001, the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' awarded Brutal Truth the record for \"Shortest Music Video\" for 1994's \"[[Extreme Conditions Demand Extreme Responses|Collateral Damage]]\" (the song lasts four seconds). In 2007, the video for the Napalm Death song \"[[You Suffer]]\" set a new \"Shortest Music Video\" record: 1.3 seconds.<ref name=\"OCW\">{{cite web|url= http://www.ocweekly.com/2006-03-09/music/extreme-extremeness/|title= Extreme Extremeness|author= McPheeters, Sam|date= 2006-03-09|publisher=Orange County Weekly |accessdate= 2011-03-27}}</ref> Beyond the microsong, it is characteristic of grindcore to have short songs in general; for example, [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]]' debut album ''[[Reek of Putrefaction]]'' (1988) consists of 22 tracks with an average length of 1 minute and 48 seconds. It is also not uncommon for grindcore albums to be very short when compared to other genres, usually consisting of a large track list but having a total length of only 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nMany grindcore groups experiment with down-tuned guitars. While the [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] [[A-side]] of Napalm Death's debut, 1987's ''[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]'', is set to [[standard tuning]], on side B, the guitars are tuned down 2\u00bd steps. Their second album ''[[From Enslavement to Obliteration]]'' and the ''[[Mentally Murdered]]'' EP were tuned to [[C (musical note)|C]][[Sharp (music)|\u266f]]. ''[[Harmony Corruption]]'', their third full-length album, was tuned up to a [[D tuning|D]]. [[Bolt Thrower]] went  further, dropping 3\u00bd steps down ([[A (musical note)|A]]).<ref name=johnson200704>Johnson 2007, page 04.</ref> Bass is tuned low as well, and is often distorted.\n\n=== Blast beat ===\n{{main|Blast beat}}\n{{listen|filename=blast_beat.ogg|title=An example of a blast beat|description=A blast beat played at tempos of 124, 160, 200 and 240 BPM, respectively.|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nThe blast beat is a drum beat characteristic of grindcore in all its forms,<ref name=macgregor>Adam MacGregor, Agoraphobic Nosebleed review, ''Dusted'', June 11, 2006.

In Adam MacGregor's definition, \"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\"<ref name=macgregor/> Blast beats have been described as \"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per second than sheer sonic violence.\"<ref name=greenway>Strub, Whitney.

Daniel Ekeroth argues that the blast beat was first performed by the Swedish group Asocial on their 1982 demo.<ref>Ekeroth, p. 22.</ref> [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles]] (\"No Sense\"),<ref name=macgregor/> [[Stormtroopers of Death]] (\"Milk\"),<ref>Stormtroopers of Death, 1985, track 11.</ref> [[Sarc\u00f3fago]] (\"Satanas\"),<ref>Sarc\u00f3fago,</ref> [[Sepultura]] (\"Antichrist\"),<ref>Sepultura, 1986, track 10.</ref> and [[Repulsion (band)|Repulsion]]<ref name=repulsion/> also included the technique prior to Napalm Death's emergence.\n\n=== Lyrical themes ===\nGrindcore lyrics are typically provocative. A number of grindcore musicians are committed to political and ethical causes, generally leaning towards the [[Far-left politics|far left]] in connection to grindcore's punk roots.<ref name=gs46>\"Grindcore Special,\" p. 46.</ref> For example, Napalm Death's songs address a variety of [[anarchist]] concerns, in the tradition of [[anarcho-punk]]. These themes include [[anti-racism]], [[feminism]], [[anti-militarism]], and [[anti-capitalism]]. Other grindcore groups, such as [[Cattle Decapitation]] and [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], have expressed disgust with human behavior, animal abuse, and are, in some cases, [[vegetarians]] or [[veganism|vegans]].<ref>Carcass biography.

In a ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine article written about the genre, [[Steven Blush]] declares that \"the man often credited\" for dubbing the style grindcore was [[Shane Embury]], Napalm Death's bassist since 1987. Embury offers his own account of how the grindcore \"sound\" came to be:\n\n{{quote|As far as how this whole sound got started, we were really into [[Celtic Frost]], Siege \u2013 which is a hardcore band from [[Boston]] \u2013 a lot of hardcore and death-metal bands, and some industrial-noise bands like the early Swans.

He was the son of [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]] and a member of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. He married firstly, in 1559, [[Elisabeth of Brandenburg-K\u00fcstrin]] (29 August 1540 \u2013 8 March 1578). He married secondly, in 1579, [[Sophie of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (30 October 1563 \u2013 1639), daughter of [[William of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] and [[Dorothea of Denmark, Duchess of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Dorothea of Denmark]].\n\nGeorge Frederick reigned in his native [[Ansbach]], [[Franconia]] and [[Krnov|J\u00e4gerndorf]], [[Upper Silesia]] since 1556 and, after the death of his cousin [[Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach|Albert Alcibiades]] in 1557, also in [[Kulmbach]]. He took over the administration of the [[Duchy of Prussia]] in 1577, when the then-reigning Duke [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]] became ill.\n\nHe was the last of the older [[Franconia]] line of the House of Hohenzollern. Upon his death Ansbach and [[Kulmbach]] were inherited by younger princes of the Brandenburg line according to the [[House Treaty of Gera]] of 1598.\n\nGeorge Frederick rebuilt the palace and fortress [[Plassenburg]], which was destroyed after the second margravian war  (1552\u20131554), as one of the most impressive residences of the renaissance in the German empire. He also built the fortress [[W\u00fclzburg]] and the old palace in [[Bayreuth]].\n\nDuring his reign between 1557 and 1603 in the Franconian territories of the Hohenzollern (Brandenburg-Ansbach and Brandenburg-Kulmbach) he kept peace, rebuilt cities and Castles, founded several schools and a University.\n\n== Ancestors ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n| 1= 1.

Through his mother, he was related to the royal court in [[Buda]].  He entered the service of his uncle, King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary]], living at his court from 1506.  The king received him as an adopted son, entrusted him in 1515 with the [[Duchy of Opole|Duchy of Oppeln]], and in 1516 made him member of the tutelary government instituted for [[Hungary]], and tutor of his son [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]]. In 1521 he made an arrangement with [[Petar Keglevi\u0107]] and pulled back from Hungary and Croatia; this arrangement, accepted by Louis II in 1526, was not accepted by [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I]] until 1559.\n\n=== Territories and influence ===\nAt the court of Hungary there were two parties arrayed against each other: the [[Magyars|Magyar]] party under the leadership of [[Z\u00e1polya]]s and the German party under the leadership of George of Brandenburg, whose authority was increased by the acquisition of the [[Duchy of Racib\u00f3rz|duchies of Ratibor]] and Oppeln by hereditary treaties with their respective dukes and of the territories of [[Bohum\u00edn|Oderberg]], [[Bytom|Beuthen]], and [[Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry|Tarnowitz]] as pledges from the [[king of Bohemia]], who could not redeem his debts.\n\nBy the further appropriation of the [[Duchy of Krnov|Duchy of J\u00e4gerndorf]], George came into possession of all [[Upper Silesia]].  As the owner and mortgagee of these territories he prepared the way for the introduction of the [[Protestant Reformation]], here as well as in his native [[Franconia]].  Earlier than any other German prince or any other member of the Hohenzollern line including even his younger brother [[Albert I, Duke of Prussia|Albert]], the [[Hochmeister|Grand Master]] of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]], he turned his eyes and heart to the new faith proceeding from [[Wittenberg]].\n\n=== Conversion ===\nThe first reformatory writings began the work of winning him over to the evangelical cause. [[Martin Luther]]'s powerful testimony of faith at the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521 made an indelible impression upon his mind, and the vigorous sermons of evangelical preachers in the pulpits of [[St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Sebaldus Church|St. Sebald]] in [[Nuremberg]], during the diet there in 1522, deepened the impression. The study of [[Luther Bible|Luther's translation]] of the [[New Testament]], which appeared in 1522, established his faith on personal conviction. Moreover, he entered into correspondence with Luther, discussing with him the most important problems of faith, and in 1524 he met him personally during the negotiations concerning his brother [[Albert I, Duke of Prussia|Albert]]'s secularization of the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic Order's state of Prussia]] into the secular [[Duchy of Prussia]].\n\nAfter the accession of King Louis II, George was aided in his reforming efforts by [[Mary of Habsburg|Queen Maria]], a sister of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], who was favorably inclined toward the new doctrine.  As the adviser of the young king, George firmly advocated the cause of the new gospel against the influences and intrigues of his clerical opponents and successfully prevented their violent measures.  His relationship with Duke [[Frederick II of Legnica|Frederick II]] of [[Duchy of Legnica|Liegnitz]], [[Duchy of Brzeg|Brieg]], and [[Wo\u0142\u00f3w|Wohlau]], and with Duke [[Charles I, Duke of M\u00fcnsterberg-Oels|Charles I]] of [[Duchy of M\u00fcnsterberg (Zi\u0119bice)|M\u00fcnsterberg]]-[[Duchy of Oels|Oels]], who had both admitted the Reformation into their territories, contributed not a little to the expansion of the gospel in his own lands.  But it was his own personal influence, energy, and practical spirit that introduced the new doctrine and founded a new evangelical and churchly life.  He made efforts to secure preachers of the new gospel from Hungary, Silesia, and Franconia, and tried to introduce the church order of Brandenburg-Nuremberg, which had already found acceptance in the Franconian territories.\n\n=== Reformation in Franconia ===\nIn the hereditary lands [[Brandenburg-Ansbach]] in Franconia, where with his older brother [[Casimir, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Casimir]] of [[Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] he had assumed the regency in place of their father, he encountered greater difficulties, although the popular spirit was inclined toward the Reformation.  Owing to his marriage with a Bavarian princess and to his military command in the imperial service, his brother was allied more closely with the old church and resisted the new reforming  efforts.  But the pressure of the estates of the land soon compelled him to allow preaching according to Luther's doctrine, although he ensured retention of the old church ceremonies, even of those that were contrary to the new faith.\n\nGeorge protested against such half-measures and showed his dissatisfaction with the half-hearted resolutions of the state assembly of October 1526. It was only after the death of his brother that as sole ruler he could successfully undertake and carry out reformation in the Franconian territories, with the assistance of councillors such as [[Johann von Schwarzenberg]] and through the new resolutions of the state assembly of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1528).  At the same time George maintained his correspondence with Luther and [[Philipp Melanchthon]], discussing such questions as the evangelization of monasteries, the use of monastic property for evangelical purposes, and especially the foundation of lower schools for the people and of higher schools for the education of talented young men for the service of church and state.  He tried to gain, by his continued correspondence with Luther and other reformers such as [[Urbanus Rhegius]], efficient men for the preaching of the gospel and for the organization of the evangelical church. Hand in hand with the Council of Nuremberg he worked for the institution of a church visitation on the model of that of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], from which after repeated revisions and emendations the excellent [[Kirchenordnung|church order]] of Brandenburg-Nuremberg of 1533 was developed. After its introduction in Nuremberg and his territories in Franconia, it was also introduced in his dominions in Upper Silesia.\n\n=== Influence beyond his territories ===\nGeorge's influence manifested itself also in the development of the German Reformation as a whole.  When a union of the evangelicals in upper and lower Germany was contemplated as a means of improved defense against the retaliatory measures of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], George had a meeting with Elector [[John, Elector of Saxony|John]] of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] at [[Schleitz]] in 1529, where they agreed on certain articles of faith and confession to be drawn up by Luther; the commission was executed in the seventeen articles of [[Schwabach]] on the basis of the fifteen theses of the [[Marburg Colloquy]].\n\nBut neither at the Convention of Schwabach nor at that of [[Schmalkalden]] did George approve armed resistance against the emperor and his party, even in self-defense.  He opposed the emperor energetically at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530, when the emperor demanded the prohibition of evangelical preaching.  King Ferdinand made George the most alluring offers of Silesian possessions if he would support the emperor, but he strongly rejected them.  Next to the elector of Saxony, he stands foremost among the princes who defended the reformed faith. After the death of his cousin, [[Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim I]], who was a strict Romanist, he assisted his sons in the introduction of the Reformation in the territories of the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]].  He took part in the [[religious colloquy of Regensburg]] in 1541 where Elector [[Joachim II, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim II]] made a last attempt to bridge the differences between the Romanists and evangelicals and with his nephew requested Luther's cooperation.

The case ''t'' = 2 yields the [[root mean square]].  As ''t'' approaches 0, the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] of ''M''(''t'') is the [[geometric mean]] of the given numbers, and so it makes sense to ''define'' ''M''(0) to be the geometric mean. Furthermore, as ''t'' approaches \u221e, ''M''(''t'') approaches the maximum of the given numbers, and as ''t'' approaches \u2212\u221e, ''M''(''t'') approaches the minimum of the given numbers.\n-->\n* Each generalized mean always lies between the smallest and largest of the ''x'' values.\n* Each generalized mean is a symmetric function of its arguments; permuting the arguments of a generalized mean does not change its value.\n* Like most [[Mean#Properties|mean]]s, the generalized mean is a [[homogeneous function]] of its arguments ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>''. That is, if ''b'' is a positive real number, then the generalized mean with exponent ''p'' of the numbers <math>b\\cdot x_1,\\dots, b\\cdot x_n</math> is equal to ''b'' times the generalized mean of the numbers ''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x<sub>n</sub>''.\n* Like the [[quasi-arithmetic mean]]s, the computation of the mean can be split into computations of equal sized sub-blocks.

''f'' is a power function, so it does have a second derivative:\n\n: <math>f''(x) = \\left(\\frac{q}{p} \\right) \\left( \\frac{q}{p}-1 \\right)x^{\\frac{q}{p}-2}</math>\n\nwhich is strictly positive within the domain of ''f'', since ''q'' > ''p'', so we know ''f'' is convex.\n\nUsing this, and the Jensen's inequality we get:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n     f \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^nw_ix_i^p \\right) &\\leq \\sum_{i=1}^nw_if(x_i^p) \\\\[3pt]\n  \\sqrt[\\frac{p}{q}]{\\sum_{i=1}^nw_ix_i^p} &\\leq \\sum_{i=1}^nw_ix_i^q\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nafter raising both side to the power of 1/''q'' (an increasing function, since 1/''q'' is positive) we get the inequality which was to be proven:\n\n:<math>\\sqrt[p]{\\sum_{i=1}^nw_ix_i^p}\\leq\\sqrt[q]{\\sum_{i=1}^nw_ix_i^q}</math>\n\nUsing the previously shown equivalence we can prove the inequality for negative ''p'' and ''q'' by substituting them with, respectively, \u2212''q'' and \u2212''p'', QED.\n\n== Generalized ''f''-mean ==\n{{Main|Generalized f-mean|l1=Generalized {{mvar|f}}-mean}}\n\nThe power mean could be generalized further to the [[generalized f-mean|generalized ''f''-mean]]:\n\n:<math> M_f(x_1,\\dots,x_n) = f^{-1} \\left({\\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\sum_{i=1}^n{f(x_i)}}\\right) </math>\n\nThis covers the geometric mean without using a limit with ''f''(''x'') = ''log''(''x''). The power mean is obtained for ''f''(''x'') = ''x<sup>p</sup>''.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n===Signal processing===\nA power mean serves a non-linear [[moving average]] which is shifted towards small signal values for small ''p'' and emphasizes big signal values for big ''p''. Given an efficient implementation of a [[lowpass|moving arithmetic mean]] called <code>smooth</code> one can implement a moving power mean according to the following [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] code.\n\n<source lang=\"haskell\">\n powerSmooth :: Floating a => ([a] -> [a]) -> a -> [a] -> [a]\n powerSmooth smooth p = map (** recip p) . smooth . map (**p)\n</source>\n\n* For big ''p'' it can serve an [[envelope detector]] on a [[rectifier|rectified]] signal.\n* For small ''p'' it can serve an [[Baseline (spectrometry)|baseline detector]] on a [[mass spectrum]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arithmetic mean]]\n* [[Arithmetic-geometric mean]]\n* [[Average]]\n* [[Geometric mean]]\n* [[Harmonic mean]]\n* [[Heronian mean]]\n* [[Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]]\n* [[Lehmer mean]] &ndash; also a mean related to [[Power (mathematics)|powers]]\n* [[Pythagorean means]]\n* [[Root mean square]]\n* [[Minkowski distance]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerMean.html Power mean at MathWorld]\n*[http://people.revoledu.com/kardi/tutorial/BasicMath/Average/Generalized%20mean.html Examples of Generalized Mean]\n*A [http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=objects&name=ProofOfGeneralMeansInequality proof of the Generalized Mean] on [[PlanetMath]]\n\n[[Category:Means]]\n[[Category:Inequalities]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Haskell code]]", "sha1": "li30num4yhi2qy6dczp5k9iobj4c9ud"}}, {"title": "G.I.", "ns": "0", "id": "13144", "redirect": {"title": "GI"}, "revision": {"id": "57295373", "parentid": "52521321", "timestamp": "2006-06-07T03:29:19Z", "contributor": {"username": "Timrem", "id": "1033212"}, "comment": "redirect to GI", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[GI]]", "sha1": "adzkmhehtszlsl7o2qeeh5prmib5knp"}}, {"title": "Gerolamo Cardano", "ns": "0", "id": "13145", "revision": {"id": "864456482", "parentid": "858451137", "timestamp": "2018-10-17T09:48:05Z", "contributor": {"username": "Celia Homeford", "id": "28078513"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* top */See [[Template:Birth date#hCard microformat]].", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|Cardanus|the lunar crater|Cardanus (crater)|}}\n{{Redirect|Cardano|the technology platform|Cardano (platform)|}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n<!-- Leave redlink to prevent ambiguous \"(genus)\". -->\n{{Infobox scientist\n|name              = Gerolamo Cardano\n|image             = Jer\u00f4me Cardan.jpg\n|caption           = Gerolamo Cardano\n|birth_date        = 24 September 1501\n|birth_place       = [[Pavia]]\n|death_date        = {{Death date and age|df=yes|1576|9|21|1501|9|24}}\n|death_place       = Italy\n|residence         =\n|citizenship       =\n|nationality       = Italian\n|field             = Science, maths, philosophy, and literature\n|work_institutions =\n|alma_mater        = [[University of Pavia]]\n|doctoral_advisor  =\n|doctoral_students =\n|known_for         = Polymath, founder of various fields and inventor of several machines\n|influences        = [[Archimedes]], [[Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]], [[Leonardo Fibonacci]]\n|influenced        = [[Blaise Pascal]],<ref name=\"MCS\">{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J.J. |last2=Robertson |first2=E.F. |authorlink1=John J.

He made significant contributions to [[hypocycloid]]s, published in ''De proportionibus'', in 1570.

In 1525, Cardano repeatedly applied to the College of Physicians in Milan, but was not admitted owing to his combative reputation and illegitimate birth. However, he was consulted by many members of the College of Physicians due to his irrefutable intelligence.<ref>http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Cardan.html</ref>\n\n== Early career as a physician ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}\nCardano wanted to practice medicine in a large, rich city like Milan, but he was denied a license to practice, so he settled for the town of [[Saccolongo]], where he practiced without a license. There, he married Lucia Banderini in 1531. Before her death in 1546, they had three children, Giovanni Battista (1534), Chiara (1537) and Aldo (1543).<ref name=\"Maggi2001\" /> Cardano later wrote that those were the happiest days of his life.\n\nWith the help of a few noblemen, Cardano obtained a teaching position in mathematics in Milan. Having finally received his medical license, he practiced mathematics and medicine simultaneously, treating a few influential patients in the process. Because of this, he became one of the most sought-after doctors in Milan. In fact, by 1536, he was able to quit his teaching position, although he was still interested in mathematics. His notability in the medical field was such that the aristocracy tried to lure him out of Milan. Cardano later wrote that he turned down offers from the kings of Denmark and France, and the Queen of Scotland.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=60|oclc=41497065}}</ref>\n\n== Mathematics ==\n[[File:Gerolamo Cardano (colour).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait of Cardano on display at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, [[University of St Andrews]].]]\n\nCardano was the first mathematician to make systematic use of negative numbers.<ref>[[Isaac Asimov]], ''Asimov on Numbers'', published by [[Pocket Books]], a division of [[Simon & Schuster]], 1966, 1977, page 119.</ref> He published with attribution the solution of [[Scipione del Ferro]] to the [[cubic equation]] and the solution of his student [[Lodovico Ferrari]] to the [[quartic equation]] in his 1545 book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]''.

In ''Opus novum de proportionibus'' he introduced the [[binomial coefficient]]s and the [[binomial theorem]].\n\nCardano was notoriously short of money and kept himself solvent by being an accomplished gambler and [[chess]] player. His book about games of chance, ''Liber de ludo aleae'' (\"Book on Games of Chance\"), written around 1564,<ref name=\"LudoYear\">In Chapter 20 of ''Liber de Ludo Aleae'' he describes a personal experience from 1526 and then adds that \"thirty-eight years have passed\" [elapsis iam annis triginta octo].

He used the game of throwing dice to understand the basic concepts of probability. He demonstrated the efficacy of defining [[odds]] as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2113/index_files/Gorroochurn-Some%20Laws.pdf Some laws and problems in classical probability and how Cardano anticipated them Gorrochum, P.

He published two encyclopedias of natural science which contain a wide variety of inventions, facts, and occult superstitions. He also introduced the [[Cardan grille]], a cryptographic writing tool, in 1550.\n\nSomeone also assigned to Cardano the credit for the invention of the so-called ''[[Cardano's Rings]]'', also called [[Baguenaudier|Chinese Rings]], but it is very probable that they predate Cardano.\n\nSignificantly, in the history of [[education of the deaf]], he said that deaf people were capable of using their minds, argued for the importance of teaching them, and was one of the first to state that deaf people could learn to read and write without learning how to speak first. He was familiar with a report by [[Rudolph Agricola]] about a deaf mute who had learned to write.\n\n== ''De Subtilitate'' (1550) ==\nAs quoted from [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]'':\n<blockquote>\nThe title of a work of Cardano's, published in 1552, ''De Subtilitate'' (corresponding to what would now be called [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling#Naturphilosophie|transcendental philosophy]]), would lead us to expect, in the chapter on minerals, many far fetched theories characteristic of that age; but when treating of petrified shells, he decided that they clearly indicated the former sojourn of the sea upon the mountains.<ref>[[wikiquote:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mmIOAAAAQAAJ& Principles of Geology]'', 1832, p.29</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== Later years and death ==\nTwo of Cardano's children\u2014Giovanni and Aldo Battista\u2014came to ignoble ends. Giovanni Battista, Cardano's eldest and favorite son, was tried and [[death penalty|beheaded]] in 1560 for poisoning his wife,<ref name=\":0\" /> after he discovered that their three children were not his. Aldo Battista was a gambler, who stole money from his father, and so Gerolamo disinherited Aldo in 1569.\n\nCardano moved from Pavia to Bologna, in part because he believed that the decision to execute Giovanni was influenced by Gerolamo's battles with the academic establishment in Pavia, and his colleagues' jealousy at his scientific achievements and also because he was beset with allegations of sexual impropriety with his students.<ref name=\"Maggi2001\"/> Cardano was arrested by the [[Inquisition]] in 1570 for unknown reasons, and forced to spend several months in prison and abjure his professorship. He moved to Rome, and received a lifetime [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] from [[Pope Gregory XIII]] (after first having been rejected by [[Pope Pius V]]) and finished his autobiography. He was accepted in the Royal College of Physicians, and as well as practising medicine he continued his philosophical studies until his death in 1576.<ref name=Westfall /><ref name=\"Maggi2001\"/> Cardano is reported to have correctly predicted the exact date of his own death but it has been claimed that he achieved this by committing suicide.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/periodictable/html/Cd.html|title=Girolamo Cardano|website=www2.stetson.edu|access-date=2017-10-10}}</ref>\n\n== References in literature ==\n\nThe seventeenth century English physician and philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]] once possessed the ten volumes of the Leyden 1663 edition of the complete works of Cardan in [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne|his library]].<ref>A Facsimile of the 1711 Sales Auction Catalogue of Sir Thomas Browne and his son Edward's Libraries. Introduction, notes and index by J.S. Finch (E.J.

Significantly, he values him only for his superstitious and astrological writings; his scientific writings are dismissed because they contradict [[Aristotle]], but excused on the ground that the author of the astrological works deserves to be listened to even when he is wrong.\n\nEnglish novelist [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[Abinger Harvest]]'', a 1936 volume of essays, authorial reviews and a play, provides a sympathetic treatment of Cardano in the section titled 'The Past'. Forster believes Cardano was so absorbed in \"self-analysis that he often forgot to repent of his bad temper, his stupidity, his licentiousness, and love of revenge\" (212).\n\n== Works ==\n* ''De malo recentiorum medicorum usu libellus'', Venice, 1536 (on medicine).\n* ''Practica arithmetice et mensurandi singularis'', Milan, 1577 (on mathematics).\n* ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Artis magnae, sive de regulis algebraicis]]'' (also known as ''Ars magna''), Nuremberg, 1545 (on algebra).<ref>[http://www.filosofia.unimi.it/cardano/testi/operaomnia/vol_4_s_4.pdf] An electronic copy of his book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]'' (in Latin)</ref>\n**{{Citation |translator=Witmer, T.

Slow-cooling, coarse-grained gabbro is chemically equivalent to rapid-cooling, fine-grained basalt. Much of the Earth's [[oceanic crust]] is made of gabbro, formed at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. Gabbro is also found as [[pluton]]s associated with continental [[volcanism]]. Due to its variant nature, the term \"gabbro\" may be applied loosely to a wide range of intrusive rocks, many of which are merely \"gabbroic\".\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term \"gabbro\" was used in the 1760s to name a set of rock types that were found in the ophiolites of the [[Apennine Mountains]] in Italy.<ref>Bortolotti, V. et al. ''Chapter 11: Ophiolites, Ligurides and the tectonic evolution from spreading to convergence of a Mesozoic Western Tethys segment'' in F. Vai, G.P. and Martini, I.P.

''Chapter 11: Ophiolites, Ligurides and the tectonic evolution from spreading to convergence of a Mesozoic Western Tethys segment'' in F. Vai, G.P. and Martini, I.P. (editors) (2001) ''Anatomy of an Orogen: The Apennines and Adjacent Mediterranean Basins'', Dordrecht, Springer Science and Business Media, p. 152. {{ISBN|978-90-481-4020-6}}</ref> He assigned the name \"gabbro\" to rocks that geologists nowadays would more strictly call \"metagabbro\" ([[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] gabbro).<ref>[http://www.sandatlas.org/gabbro/ ''Gabbro''] at SandAtlas geology blog. Retrieved on 2015-07-09.</ref>\n\n==Petrology==\n[[File:Mineralogy igneous rocks EN.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Mineral assemblage of igneous rocks]]\n[[Image:main ridge of the cuillin in skye arp.jpg|thumb|right|A gabbro landscape on the main ridge of the [[Cuillin]], [[Isle of Skye]], [[Scotland]].]]\nGabbro is dense, greenish or dark-colored and contains [[pyroxene]], [[plagioclase]], and minor amounts of [[amphibole]] and [[olivine]].\n\nThe pyroxene content is mostly [[clinopyroxene]], generally [[augite]], but small amounts of [[orthopyroxene]] may also be present. If the amount of orthopyroxene is more than 95% of the total pyroxene content (5% or less clinopyroxene content), then the rock is termed [[norite]]. On the other hand, gabbro has more than 95% of its pyroxenes in the form of the [[monoclinic]] clinopyroxene/s. Intermediate rocks are termed gabbro-norite. The [[calcium]] rich [[plagioclase feldspar]] ([[labradorite]]-[[bytownite]]) and pyroxene content vary between 10\u201390% in gabbro. If more than 90% plagioclase is present, then the rock is an [[anorthosite]]. If on the other hand, the rock contains more than 90% pyroxenes (often both are present), it is termed [[pyroxenite]]. Gabbro may also contain small amounts of [[olivine]] (\"olivine gabbro\" if substantial amount of olivine is present), [[amphibole]] and [[biotite]]. The [[quartz]] content in gabbro is less than 5% of total volume. 'Quartz gabbros' or monzogabbros are also known to occur, for example the ''cizlakite'' at [[Pohorje]] in northeastern Slovenia,<ref> Le Maitre, R. W.; et al., eds., 2005, ''Igneous Rocks: A Classification and Glossary of Terms,'' Cambridge Univ. Press, 2nd ed., p. 69, {{ISBN|9780521619486}}</ref> and are probably derived from magma that was over-saturated with [[silica]]. [[Essexite]]s represent gabbros whose parent magma was under-saturated with silica, resulting in the formation of the [[feldspathoid]] minerals [[nepheline]], [[cancrinite]], and [[sodalite]] as accessory minerals rather than quartz. (Silica saturation of a rock can be evaluated by [[normative mineralogy]]). Gabbros contain minor amounts, typically a few percent, of iron-titanium oxides such as [[magnetite]], [[ilmenite]], and [[ulvospinel]].\n\nGabbro is generally coarse grained, with crystals in the size range of 1&nbsp;mm or greater. Finer grained equivalents of gabbro are called [[diabase]] (also known as [[dolerite]]), although the term ''microgabbro'' is often used when extra descriptiveness is desired. Gabbro may be extremely coarse grained to [[pegmatitic]], and some pyroxene-plagioclase [[Cumulate rock|cumulates]] are essentially coarse grained gabbro, some may exhibit acicular crystal habits.\n\nGabbro is usually [[equigranular]] in texture, although it may be [[porphyritic]] at times, especially when plagioclase oikocrysts have grown earlier than the groundmass minerals.\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:Zuma rock.jpg|thumb|[[Zuma Rock]], Nigeria, a massive, nearly uniform, intrusion of gabbro and granodiorite.]]\nGabbro can be formed as a massive, uniform intrusion via in-situ crystallisation of [[pyroxene]] and [[plagioclase]], or as part of a [[layered intrusion]] as a [[Cumulate rock|cumulate]] formed by settling of pyroxene and plagioclase. Cumulate gabbros are more properly termed ''pyroxene-plagioclase adcumulate''.\n\nGabbro is an essential part of the oceanic crust, and can be found in many [[ophiolite]] complexes as parts of zones III and IV ([[Sheeted dyke complex|sheeted dyke zone]] to massive gabbro zone). Long belts of gabbroic intrusions are typically formed at proto-rift zones and around ancient [[rift]] zone margins, intruding into the rift flanks. [[Mantle plume]] hypotheses may rely on identifying mafic and ultramafic intrusions and coeval [[basalt]] volcanism.\n\nNearly all gabbros are found in plutonic bodies, but to restrict the term (as the International Union of Geological Sciences, IUGS, suggests) just to plutonic rocks is inappropriate, because gabbro may be found as a coarse- grained interior facies of certain thick lavas (see, for example<ref>Arndt et al., 1977, ''Komatiitic and iron-rich tholeiitic lavas of Munro Township, northeast Ontario'': J. Petrol., v. 18, pp. 319\u201369</ref>). It is better to base a rock definition on descriptive characteristics of the rock rather than how or where it was formed.<ref>Robin Gill. ''Igneous Rocks and Processes'', 2010{{ISBN?}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nGabbro often contains valuable amounts of [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[platinum]], and [[copper]] [[sulfide]]s.\n\nOcellar (orbicular) varieties of gabbro can be used as ornamental facing stones, paving stones and it is also known by the trade name of 'black granite', which is a popular type of graveyard headstone used in funerary rites. It is also used in kitchens and their countertops, also under the misnomer of 'black granite'.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* {{annotated link|Peridotite}}\n* {{annotated link|Igneous differentiation}}\n* {{annotated link|Fractional crystallization (geology)|Fractional crystallisation}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/prelim/176_PREL/176IGNE.HTML Ocean drilling program gabbro petrology]\n*[http://www.livescience.com/forcesofnature/060420_earth_drill.html Scientists find the elusive gabbro]\n\n{{Igneous rocks}}\n\n[[Category:Mafic rocks]]\n[[Category:Igneous petrology]]\n[[Category:Plutonic rocks]]", "sha1": "mimx0g873jpgy1s3kc0nxs57i94j58z"}}, {"title": "Gene Roddenberry", "ns": "0", "id": "13148", "revision": {"id": "866731510", "parentid": "866713038", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T05:30:07Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "id": "753665"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* External links */add category", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{good article}} \n{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name         = Gene Roddenberry\n| image        = Gene Roddenberry crop.jpg\n| caption      = Roddenberry in 1976, Outside the [[Space Shuttle Enterprise]]\n| birth_name   = Eugene Wesley Roddenberry\n| birth_date   = {{Birth date|mf=yes|1921|8|19}}\n| birth_place  = [[El Paso, Texas]], U.S.\n| death_date   = {{nowrap|{{Death date and age|1991|10|24|1921|8|19}}}}\n| death_place  = [[Santa Monica, California]], U.S.\n| other_names  = Robert Wesley\n| education    = [[Franklin High School (Los Angeles, California)|Franklin High School]]\n| alma_mater   = [[Los Angeles City College]]\n| home_town    = Los Angeles\n| residence    = [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]]\n| occupation   = [[Television writer]], [[Television producer|producer]]\n| parents      = Eugene Edward Roddenberry<br>Caroline \"Glen\" Golemon\n| spouse       = {{marriage|Eileen-Anita Rexroat<br>|1942|1969|end=div}}<br>{{marriage|[[Majel Barrett]]<br>|1969}}\n| children     = 3, including [[Rod Roddenberry]]\n| module       = {{Infobox military person|embed=yes\n| allegiance   = {{Flagu|United States}}\n| branch 1941-1941       = [[File:USAAC_Roundel_1919-1941.svg|25px]] [[United States Army Air Corps]]\n| branch 1941-1945       = [[File:US_Army_Air_Corps_Hap_Arnold_Wings.svg|25px]] [[United States Army Air Forces]]| serviceyears = 1941\u20131945\n| unit         = [[394th Combat Training Squadron|394th Bombardment Squadron]]\n| rank         = [[File:US-O3 insignia.svg|25px]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]]\n| battles      = [[World War II]]\n| awards       = [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]<br/>[[Air Medal]]}}\n}}\n\n'''Eugene Wesley Roddenberry''' (August 19, 1921 \u2013 October 24, 1991) was an American television [[screenwriter]] and [[TV producer|producer]]. He is best remembered for creating the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'' television series]]. Born in [[El Paso, Texas]], Roddenberry grew up in [[Los Angeles]], where his father was a police officer. Roddenberry flew 89 combat missions in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] during World War&nbsp;II, and worked as a commercial pilot after the war. Later, he followed in his father's footsteps and joined the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], where he also began to write scripts for television.\n\nAs a [[freelance writer]], Roddenberry wrote scripts for ''[[Highway Patrol (U.S. TV series)|Highway Patrol]]'', ''[[Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]]'', and other series, before creating and producing his own television series ''[[The Lieutenant]].'' In 1964, Roddenberry created ''[[Star Trek]]'', which premiered in 1966 and ran for three seasons before being canceled. He then worked on other projects, including a string of failed television pilots. The syndication of ''Star Trek'' led to its growing popularity; this, in turn, resulted in the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' feature films]], on which Roddenberry continued to produce and consult. In 1987, the sequel series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' began airing on television in [[broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]]; Roddenberry was heavily involved in the initial development of the series, but took a less active role after the first season due to ill health. He continued to consult on the series until his death in 1991.\n\nIn 1985, he became the first TV writer with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], and he was later inducted by both the [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame|Science Fiction Hall of Fame]] and the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] Hall of Fame. Years after his death, Roddenberry was one of the first humans to have his ashes carried into earth orbit. The popularity of the ''Star Trek'' universe and films has inspired films, books, comic books, video games, and [[Star Trek fan productions|fan films]] set in the ''Star Trek'' universe.\n\n==Early life and career==\n{{main|Early life and career of Gene Roddenberry}}\n[[File:Gene Roddenberry 1939.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Gene Roddenberry, during his senior year at high school]]\nRoddenberry was born on August 19, 1921, in his parents' rented home in El Paso, Texas, the first child of Eugene Edward Roddenberry and Caroline \"Glen\" (n\u00e9e Goleman) Roddenberry.

The duo later learned that CBS had been eager to find out about ''Star Trek'' because it had a science fiction series in development\u2014''[[Lost in Space]]''.

In December, he decided to write lyrics to the ''Star Trek'' theme; this angered the theme's composer, [[Alexander Courage]], as it meant that royalties would be split between them. In February 1966, NBC informed Desilu that they were buying ''Star Trek'' and that it would be included in the fall 1966 television schedule.<ref>[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 255\u2013256</ref>\n\nOn May 24, the first episode of the ''Star Trek'' series went into production;<ref>[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 272</ref> Desilu was contracted to deliver 13 episodes.<ref>[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 275</ref> Five days before the first broadcast, Roddenberry appeared at the 24th [[World Science Fiction Convention]] and previewed \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\".

Not wanting to lose a potential source of income, Ellison agreed and also sought the help of other writers who also wanted to avoid losing potential income.<ref>[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 284</ref> Roddenberry corresponded with science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]] about how to address the issue of Spock's growing popularity and the possibility that his character would overshadow Kirk.<ref>[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 304</ref> Asimov suggested having Kirk and Spock work together as a team \"to get people to think of Kirk when they think of Spock.\"<ref>[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 307</ref> The series was renewed by NBC, first for a full season's order, and then for a second season.

After he was replaced on the project by television producer [[Harve Bennett]], Roddenberry was named \"[[executive consultant]]\" for the project, a position he retained for all subsequent Star Trek franchise films produced during his lifetime.

A parody of [[science fiction film]]s and [[Science fiction on television|series]], particularly ''[[Star Trek]]'' and [[Trekkie|its fandom]], the film stars [[Tim Allen]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Tony Shalhoub]], [[Sam Rockwell]], and [[Daryl Mitchell (actor)|Daryl Mitchell]] as the cast of a defunct cult television series called ''Galaxy Quest'', in which the crew of a spaceship embarked on intergalactic adventures, who are suddenly visited by actual aliens who believe the series to be an accurate documentary, and become involved in a very real intergalactic conflict.\n\nThe film was a modest box office success and was positively received by critics: it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] (an award previously won by the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series in the 1960s) and the [[Nebula Award for Best Script]], and was also nominated for ten [[Saturn Award]]s, including [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Parisot, [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Weaver, and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Rickman, with Allen winning [[Saturn Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].<ref name=\"Hugo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2000-hugo-awards/ |title=2000 Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2010-04-19 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yVVHTwxU?url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2000-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2011-05-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"Nebula\">{{cite web |url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Nebula2001.html |title=The Locus Index to SF Awards: 2001 Nebula Awards |work=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |accessdate=2011-12-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231030/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Nebula2001.html |archivedate=June 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n''Galaxy Quest'' went on to achieve [[Cult following|cult status]] through the years, particularly from ''Star Trek'' fans for its affectionate parody, but also to more mainstream audiences as a [[comedy film]] of its own.<ref name=\"7th\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/diehard-star-trek-fans-rank-the-best-and-worst-movies|title=Diehard Star Trek Fans Rank the Best and Worst Movies|work=IGN}}</ref><ref name=\"Geek.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.geek.com/geek-cetera/we-almost-got-galaxy-quest-2-with-the-original-cast-returning-but-1651671/|title=We almost got Galaxy Quest 2 with the original cast returning, but ...|work=[[Geek.com]]}}</ref><ref name=\"io9\">{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/33-secrets-you-probably-never-knew-about-the-making-of-1759220814|title=33 Secrets You Probably Never Knew About the Making of Galaxy Quest|publisher=io9 |accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref> Several former cast and crew members of ''Star Trek'' also went on to praise the film.<ref name=\"PSI\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/interviews/stewart/page13.shtml |title=Interviews: Patrick Stewart \u2013 Galaxy Quest (Star Trek Cult) |work=BBC | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140113105956/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/interviews/stewart/page13.shtml  | archivedate=2014-01-13| accessdate = 2015-09-09 }}</ref> It was included in ''[[Reader's Digest]]''{{'}}s list of The Top 100+ Funniest Movies of All Time in 2012, while ''Star Trek'' fans voted it the seventh best ''Star Trek'' film of all time in 2013.<ref name=\"7th\"/><ref name=\"Geek.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/family/the-top-100-funniest-movies-of-all-time/2/ |title=The Top 100+ Funniest Movies of All Time &#124; Reader's Digest |publisher=Rd.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-08}}</ref><ref name=\"Takei\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/startrek/takei/takei2.html |title=George Takei Is Ready To Beam Up |work=Syfy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325230032/http://www.scifi.com/startrek/takei/takei2.html |archivedate=2009-03-25}}</ref><ref name=\"MentalFloss\">{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/60540/20-things-you-might-not-know-about-galaxy-quest|title=20 Things You Might Not Know About Galaxy Quest|publisher=[[Mental Floss]]|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe former cast of the cult television space-adventure series ''Galaxy Quest'' spend most of their days attending [[fan convention]]s and promotional stunts. Though Jason Nesmith, the series' former lead star, thrives on the attention, the other cast members \u2014 Gwen DeMarco, Alexander Dane, Fred Kwan and Tommy Webber, resent Nesmith's irresponsible and self-serving attitude.\n\nDuring a convention, Nesmith is approached by a group calling themselves Thermians, led by Mathesar, who request his help; believing this to be a scheduled fan event, he agrees to be picked up the next morning. Nesmith is unaware that the Thermians are really aliens, tentacled beings using human holographic disguises. Nesmith is hungover when he is picked up, and falls asleep as they take him through space to an exact, functional version of the NSEA ''Protector'', the starship from ''Galaxy Quest''. Still hazy, Nesmith proceeds to give orders as captain, directing them to strike on Sarris, a warlord that seeks to eliminate the Thermians. Only when Nesmith is transported back to Earth does he realize that the ship is real.\n\nNesmith eagerly explains the events of the previous day to his cast members, but they consider it part of his drunken ramblings. When Laliari, another Thermian, appears and requests Nesmith's help further, he convinces the cast including Guy Fleegman, who appeared  as a [[redshirt (character)|redshirt character]] in an episode, to join him. Once aboard the ''Protector'', they are astonished by the ship, and stumble with the controls, as the Thermians only built the ship to the show's specifications but do not know how to operate it. When Sarris attacks again, they evade through a magnetic minefield and take heavy damage, disabling their power core.\n\nThe humans take a shuttle to a nearby planet to recover a new power core, having to deal with its hostile native lifeforms. By the time they return, they find that Sarris has taken over the ''Protector''. Sarris discovers that the Thermians, having no understanding of the concept of fiction, took ''Galaxy Quest'' as a documentary, and Nesmith is forced to explain they are actors to Mathesar. Sarris sets the self-destruct mechanism and leaves a sacrificial guard aboard while he returns to his ship. Nesmith and Dane use a tactic from the show to overpower their guards and free the others. While the cast and Thermian crew make repairs and familiarize themselves with the ship, Nesmith and DeMarco travel through the bowels of the ship to shut off the self-destruct sequence, aided over a misplaced Thermian communicator by superfan Brandon and his friends on Earth with detailed knowledge of the show.\n\nWith the ship repaired, Nesmith leads his cast and the Thermians to attack Sarris' ship with the magnetic mines, destroying it. The crew prepares to head home through a [[black hole]] and leaving Mathesar in command, with Nesmith giving him confidence that the Thermians can run the ship. Suddenly Sarris, who had teleported onto the ''Protector'' just before his ship was destroyed, appears on the bridge and attacks them. Nesmith activates \"Omega-13\", a plot device from the show that reverts time by 13 seconds, giving him opportunity to knock Sarris out when he first appears. However, the scuffle has caused the ship to travel too fast, too close to Earth. Mathesar informs them that they must separate the ship or die. The cast say their goodbyes, the alien crew all heading to the second bridge \u2013 though Laliari, who has fallen in love with Kwan, goes with the cast.\n\nThe command module is flung back to Earth, but the cast have no indicators where to land. Brandon and his friends set off fireworks near the convention center, where their convention is still ongoing, to guide them. The module comes to a crash landing, breaking through the center's wall into an auditorium. As the crew exit the still-smoking module, the gathered fans assume this to be part of the act. Sarris wakes up and comes out of the ship after the cast, attempting to fire on them, but Nesmith is able to vaporize him with a weapon. The fans cheer in excitement.\n\nSome time later, a revival of ''Galaxy Quest'' has been produced. The theme song plays as the credits are shown: the same cast, but this time with the additions of Fleegman and Laliari.\n\nAt the end of the credits, Mathesar can be heard saying \"Never give up; never surrender!\" \u2013 Nesmith's character's signature line.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Jason Nesmith, who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, the commander of the ''NSEA Protector'' and main character of the series\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Gwen DeMarco, who played Lieutenant Tawny Madison, the ship's communications officer\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as Alexander Dane, who played Dr. Lazarus, the ship's science officer and a member of the Mak'tar, an alien species known for their super intelligence and psionic powers\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Fred Kwan, who played Tech Sergeant Chen, the ship's chief engineer\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Guy Fleegman, who played a \"[[Redshirt (character)|redshirt]]\" (a short-lived minor character) in a single episode, simply referred to as \"Crewman #6\"\n* [[Daryl Mitchell (actor)|Daryl Mitchell]] as Tommy Webber, who played Lieutenant Laredo, a precocious child pilot\n* [[Enrico Colantoni]] as Mathesar, the leader of the Thermians\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Laliari, a Thermian and love interest for Fred\n* [[Jed Rees]] as Teb, a Thermian and Mathesar's second-in-command\n* [[Patrick Breen]] as Quellek, a Thermian who forms a bond with Alexander\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] (in his film debut) as Lahnk, another Thermian\n* [[Sam Lloyd]] as Neru, another Thermian\n* [[Robin Sachs]] as General Roth'h'ar Sarris, an evil alien reptilian humanoid who seeks to destroy the Thermians, and the antagonist of the film\n* [[Justin Long]] (in his film debut) as Brandon, a dedicated fan of ''Galaxy Quest''\n* [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]], [[Kaitlin Cullum]] and Jonathan Feyer as Brandon's friends Kyle, Katelyn and Hollister\n* [[Heidi Swedberg]] as Brandon's mother\n\nIn additional roles, the film features [[J. P. Manoux]] as an \"Excited alien\", [[Dian Bachar]] as a \"Nervous tech\", and [[Kevin McDonald]] in a [[cameo appearance]] as an announcer at a fan convention.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Writing ===\nThe original script by David Howard was titled ''Captain Starshine'' and written on spec. Producer [[Mark Johnson (producer)|Mark Johnson]], who had a first look deal with [[DreamWorks]], did not like it, but was still fascinated with its concept featuring space aliens who misconstrue old episodes of a television series. Johnson purchased the script and had Bob Gordon rewrite it into ''Galaxy Quest''.<ref name=MTV>{{cite news|author=Jordan Hoffman|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1873653/galaxy-quest-oral-history/|title='Galaxy Quest': The Oral History|publisher=MTV.com|date=July 23, 2014|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref> A fan of ''Star Trek'', Gordon was hesitant, believing ''Galaxy Quest'' \"could be a great idea or it could be a terrible idea\" and initially turned it down. He submitted his first draft to DreamWorks in 1998, which was immediately greenlit.\n\nRickman's character was originally supposed to have been [[knight]]ed by [[Elizabeth II]] before the events of the film. Rickman requested this to be changed, as he felt that it would not fit Dane's sentiment of lack of recognition; the character is still credited as \"Sir Alexander Dane\" in the credits, although all mentions of being a knight have been removed from the film.<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/><ref name=\"io9\"/> The Thermians' native planet, Klaatu Nebula, is a reference to the name of the alien visitor in the classic ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951).<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/>\n\nThe name of Rockwell's character, Guy Fleegman, is an homage to Guy Vardaman, a little-known ''Star Trek'' actor who worked extensively on ''Star Trek'' as either a [[stand-in]] or in minor roles.<ref name=\"io9\"/>\n\nThe romantic relationship between Fred Kwan and the alien Laliari comes from a suggestion of [[Steven Spielberg]], one of the owners of DreamWorks, impressed by Missi Pyle while visiting the set, to expand Missi Pyle's role in the film.<ref name=\"io9\"/><ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/>\n\n=== Crew and casting ===\nSince early in the production, Mark Johnson wanted [[Dean Parisot]], who had directed ''[[Home Fries (film)|Home Fries]]'', another film he produced, to direct ''Galaxy Quest''; however, DreamWorks favored [[Harold Ramis]] because of his experience. Ramis was hired in November 1998,<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Fleming |title=Ramis preps for blastoff on 'Galaxy Quest' |url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/ramis-preps-for-blastoff-on-galaxy-quest-1117488013/ |work=Variety |date=November 1, 1998 |accessdate=January 23, 2016}}</ref> but departed in February 1999 because of casting difficulties. He wanted [[Alec Baldwin]] for the lead role, but Baldwin turned it down. [[Steve Martin]] and [[Kevin Kline]] were considered, though Kline turned it down for family reasons. Ramis did not agree with the casting of Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith, and Parisot took over as director within three weeks. After seeing the film, Ramis said he was ultimately impressed with Allen's performance.<ref name=MTV /> About his role, Allen stated that he based his performance on [[Yul Brynner]] instead of [[William Shatner]].<ref name=\"io9\"/>\n\n[[Linda DeScenna]], [[production designer]] of the film, was interested in the project because it would not have the same aesthetics than other 1990s science fiction films, and \"it didn't have to be real, hi-tech and vacuformed\".<ref name=\"io9\"/> The design of the Thermian station was influenced by the works of artist [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]], particularly his cover art for the [[Yes (band)|Yes]] live album ''[[Yessongs]]'' (1973).<ref name=\"io9\"/>\n\nThe makers of the film wanted only \"science fiction virgins\" who had never worked in this genre to audition for Gwen DeMarco's role. Famous for science fiction roles such as [[Ellen Ripley]] in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' films]] and [[List of Ghostbusters characters#Dana Barrett|Dana Barrett]] in the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' films]], Weaver auditioned nonetheless because she wanted to work with both Allen and Rickman, and because she \"fell in love with the script\", calling it \"that great sort of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'' story of these people feeling so incomplete in the beginning, and then during the course of this adventure, they come out almost like the heroes they pretended to be in the first place\";<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/> she was surprised when discovering she actually got the role.<ref name=\"io9\"/>\n\n[[Tony Shalhoub]] originally auditioned for Guy Fleegman, but [[Sam Rockwell]] won the role, and Shalhoub was cast as Fred Kwan instead.<ref name=\"io9\"/> [[Justin Long]] said he was nervous auditioning as an unknown actor at the time, competing against [[Kieran Culkin]], [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] and [[Tom Everett Scott]] for the role of Brandon. [[Paul Rudd]] auditioned for a role, while [[David Alan Grier]] was the second choice for Tommy Webber.<ref name=MTV /> The film was [[Justin Long]]'s acting debut, and [[Rainn Wilson]]'s film debut (his only previous credit was the soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]'').<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/>\n\nAccording to casting director [[Debra Zane]], finding an actress to play the role of Laliari was very hard, as they had \"a difficult time finding a woman who could be Thermian in the same way as actors Enrico Colantoni, Rainn Wilson and Jed Rees\". Ultimately, when she auditioned Missi Pyle, she was so impressed that she sent the audition tape directly to Parisot, with a note stating \"If this is not Laliari, I will resign from the [[Casting Society of America|CSA]].\"<ref name=\"io9\"/> Steven Spielberg later asked for Laliari's role to be expanded after being impressed by her performance as well.<ref name=\"io9\"/> [[Jennifer Coolidge]] was the second choice for the role.<ref name=MTV />\n\nBoth Allen and Rockwell almost dropped out of the film; Allen had to choose between ''Galaxy Quest'' and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' and chose the first, with his ''Bicentennial Man'' role going to [[Robin Williams]] instead, while Rockwell almost backed out of the film after obtaining a lead role in an independent film; [[Kevin Spacey]] convinced him otherwise.<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/><ref name=\"io9\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nScenes on the barren planet where they stopped to get a new Beryllium Sphere and Captain Nesmith battled a rock monster, were filmed at [[Goblin Valley State Park]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=\"io9\"/> At the time, the access to Goblin Valley State Park was partly by dirt road; the fees paid by the production company were used to upgrade the entire access road to asphalt pavement.\n\nAccording to Weaver, Allen kept hectoring her during production so she would sign a piece he owned of the ''Nostromo'', the spaceship in ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', in which she starred; she ultimately did, writing \"Stolen by Tim Allen; Love, Sigourney Weaver\", which she said made him very upset.<ref name=\"io9\"/> During the period of filming, the entire cast attended a 20th anniversary screening of ''Alien''.

He probably ruled sometime between 2800 and 2500 BC and was posthumously [[Apotheosis|deified]]. He became a major figure in Sumerian legends during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] ({{circa}} 2112 \u2013 {{circa}} 2004 BC). Tales of Gilgamesh's legendary exploits are narrated in five surviving Sumerian poems. The earliest of these is probably ''[[Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld]]'', in which Gilgamesh comes to the aid of the goddess [[Inanna]] and drives away the creatures infesting her ''huluppu'' tree. She gives him two unknown objects called a ''mikku'' and a ''pikku'', which he loses. After [[Enkidu]]'s death, his [[Shade (mythology)|shade]] tells Gilgamesh about the bleak conditions in the [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|Underworld]]. The poem ''Gilgamesh and Agga'' describes Gilgamesh's revolt against his overlord [[Aga of Kish|King Agga]]. Other Sumerian poems relate Gilgamesh's defeat of the ogre [[Humbaba|Huwawa]] and the [[Bull of Heaven]] and a fifth, poorly preserved one apparently describes his death and funeral.\n\nIn later Babylonian times, these stories began to be woven into a connected narrative. The standard Akkadian ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' was composed by a scribe named [[S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni]], probably during the [[Kassites|Middle Babylonian Period]] ({{circa}} 1600 \u2013 {{circa}} 1155 BC), based on much older source material. In the epic, Gilgamesh is a [[demigod]] of superhuman strength who befriends the wildman [[Enkidu]]. Together, they go on adventures, defeating Humbaba (the [[East Semitic]] name for Huwawa) and the Bull of Heaven, who, in the epic, is sent to attack them by [[Ishtar]] (the East Semitic equivalent of Inanna) after Gilgamesh rejects her offer for him to become her consort. After Enkidu dies of a disease sent as punishment from the gods, Gilgamesh becomes afraid of his own death, and visits the sage [[Utnapishtim]], the survivor of the [[Gilgamesh flood myth|Great Flood]], hoping to find [[immortality]]. Gilgamesh repeatedly fails the trials set before him and returns home to Uruk, realizing that immortality is beyond his reach.\n\nMost classical historians agree that the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' exerted substantial influence on both the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', two epic poems written in [[ancient Greek]] during the eighth century BC. The story of Gilgamesh's birth is described in a second-century AD anecdote from ''On the Nature of Animals'' by the Greek writer [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]. Aelian relates that Gilgamesh's grandfather kept his mother under guard to prevent her from becoming pregnant, because he had been told by an [[oracle]] that his grandson would overthrow him. She became pregnant and the guards threw the child off a tower, but an eagle rescued him mid-fall and delivered him safely to an orchard, where he was raised by the gardener. The ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' was rediscovered in the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] in 1849. After being translated in the early 1870s, it caused widespread controversy due to similarities between portions of it and the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Gilgamesh remained mostly obscure until the mid-twentieth century, but, since the late twentieth-century, he has become an increasingly prominent figure in modern culture.\n\n==Historical king==\nMost historians generally agree that Gilgamesh was a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of [[Uruk]],{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=89}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=40}}{{sfn|Kramer|1963|pages=45\u201346}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=338}} who probably ruled sometime during the early part of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]] ({{circa}} 2900 \u2013 2350 BC).{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=89}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=40}} [[Stephanie Dalley]], a scholar of the ancient Near East, states that \"precise dates cannot be given for the lifetime of Gilgamesh, but they are generally agreed to lie between 2800 and 2500 BC.\"{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=40}} No contemporary mention of Gilgamesh has yet been discovered,{{sfn|Kramer|1963|pages=45\u201346}} but the 1955 discovery of the [[Tummal Inscription]], a thirty-four-line [[Historiography|historiographic]] text written during the reign of [[Ishbi-Erra]] ({{circa}} 1953 \u2013 {{circa}} 1920 BC), has cast considerable light on his reign.{{sfn|Kramer|1963|pages=45\u201346}} The inscription credits Gilgamesh with building the walls of Uruk.{{sfn|Mark|2018}} Lines eleven through fifteen of the inscription read:{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=46}}\n<blockquote><poem>\nFor a second time, the Tummal fell into ruin,\nGilgamesh built the Numunburra of the House of [[Enlil]].\nUr-lugal, the son of Gilgamesh,\nMade the Tummal pre-eminent,\nBrought [[Ninlil]] to the Tummal.{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=46}}\n</poem></blockquote>\nGilgamesh is also referred to as a king by King [[Enmebaragesi]] of Kish, a known historical figure who may have lived near Gilgamesh's lifetime.{{sfn|Mark|2018}} Furthermore, Gilgamesh is listed as one of the kings of Uruk by the [[Sumerian King List]].{{sfn|Mark|2018}} Fragments of an epic text found in Me-Turan (modern [[Tell Haddad]]) relate that at the end of his life Gilgamesh was buried under the river bed.{{sfn|Mark|2018}} The people of Uruk diverted the flow of the [[Euphrates]] passing Uruk for the purpose of burying the dead king within the river bed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2982891.stm | title=Gilgamesh tomb believed found | publisher=BBC News | date=29 April 2003 | accessdate=12 October 2017}}</ref>{{sfn|Mark|2018}}\n\n==Deification and legendary exploits==\n===Sumerian poems===\n[[File:Le dieu de l ete et dumuzi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Akkadian cylinder seal impression from [[Girsu]] ({{circa}} 2340 - 2150 BC) showing a mythological scene.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=32\u201333}} The figure in the center appears to be a god, perhaps Gilgamesh, who is bending the trunk of a tree into a curve as he chops it down.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=32\u201333}} Underneath the tree, a god ascending from the Underworld hands a mace-like object to a goddess.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=32\u201333}}]]\n\nIt is certain that, during the later Early Dynastic Period, Gilgamesh was worshipped as a god at various locations across Sumer.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=89}} In the twenty-first century BC, [[Utu-hengal]], the king of Uruk, adopted Gilgamesh as his patron deity.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=89}} The kings of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] ({{circa}} 2112 \u2013 {{circa}} 2004 BC) were especially fond of Gilgamesh,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=89}}{{sfn|Mark|2018}} calling him their \"divine brother\" and \"friend\".{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=89}} King [[Shulgi]] of Ur (2029 \u2013 1982 BC) declared himself the son of [[Lugalbanda]] and [[Ninsun]] and the brother of Gilgamesh.{{sfn|Mark|2018}} Over the centuries, there may have been a gradual accretion of stories about Gilgamesh, some possibly derived from the real lives of other historical figures, such as [[Gudea]], the Second Dynasty ruler of [[Lagash]] (2144\u20132124 BC).<ref>{{cite book | author-link=N.K.

episodic challenges, which probably originated as major independent adventures,{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=171}} but, in the epic, they are reduced to what [[Joseph Fontenrose|Joseph Eddy Fontenrose]] calls \"fairly harmless incidents.\"{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=171}} First, Gilgamesh encounters and slays lions in the mountain pass.{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=171}} Upon reaching the mountain of [[Mashu]], Gilgamesh encounters a [[scorpion man]] and his wife;{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=171}} their bodies flash with terrifying radiance,{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=171}} but, once Gilgamesh tells

finds a beautiful garden by the sea in which he meets [[Siduri]], the divine barmaid.{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=171}} At first she tries to prevent Gilgamesh from entering the

refuses to do this, she directs him to [[Urshanabi]], the ferryman of the gods, who ferries Gilgamesh across the sea to Utanpishtim's homeland.{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=171}} When Gilgamesh finally arrives at Utnapishtim's home, Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that, to become immortal, he must defy sleep.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=90}} Gilgamesh fails to do this and falls asleep for seven days without waking.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=90}}\n\nNext, Utnapishtim tells him that, even if he cannot obtain immortality, he can restore his youth using a plant with the power of rejuvenation.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=90}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=172}} Gilgamesh takes the plant, but leaves it on the shore while swimming and a snake steals it, explaining why snakes

having previously died in Tablet VII,{{sfn|Tigay|2002|pages=26\u201327}} and Gilgamesh is kind to Ishtar, despite the violent rivalry between them displayed in Tablet VI.{{sfn|Tigay|2002|pages=26\u201327}} Also, while most of the parts of the epic are free adaptations of their respective Sumerian predecessors,{{sfn|Tigay|2002|page=26}} Tablet XII is a literal, word-for-word translation of the last part of ''Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld''.{{sfn|Tigay|2002|page=26}} For these reasons, scholars conclude this narrative was probably relegated to the

Mesopotamia,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=91}} authentic representations of him in ancient art are extremely rare.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=91}} Popular works often identify depictions of a hero with

genuine ancient Mesopotamian representations of Gilgamesh do exist, however.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=91}} These representations are mostly found on clay plaques and cylinder seals.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=91}} Generally, it is only possible to identify a figure shown in art as Gilgamesh if the artistic work in question clearly depicts a scene from the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' itself.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=91}} One set of representations of Gilgamesh is found in scenes of two heroes fighting a demonic giant, certainly Humbaba.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=91}} Another set is found in scenes showing a similar pair of heroes confronting a giant, winged bull, certainly the Bull of

28\u201329}} In January 1902, the German Assyriologist [[Friedrich Delitzsch]] gave a lecture at the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]] in front of the [[Kaiser]] and his wife, in which he argued that the Flood story in the Book of Genesis was directly copied off the one in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh''.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=23\u201325}} Delitzsch's lecture was so controversial that, by September 1903, he had managed to collect 1,350 short articles from newspapers and journals, over 300 longer ones, and twenty-eight pamphlets, all written in response to this lecture, as well as another lecture about the relationship between the Code of Hammurabi and the [[Law of Moses]] in the [[Torah]].{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=25}} These articles were overwhelmingly critical of Delitzsch.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=25}} The Kaiser distanced himself from Delitzsch and his radical views{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=25}} and, in fall of 1904, Delitzsch was forced to give his third lecture in [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] rather than in Berlin.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=25}} The putative relationship between the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' and the Hebrew Bible later became a major part of Delitzsch's argument in his 1920-21 book ''Die gro\u00dfe T\u00e4uschung'' (''The Great Deception'') that the Hebrew Bible was irredeemably \"contaminated\" by Babylonian influence{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=23\u201325}} and that only by eliminating the human Old Testament entirely could Christians finally believe in the true, [[Aryan#19th century|Aryan]] message of

Cenci Hamilton, an American lawyer and businessman.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=20\u201321}} Hamilton had rudimentary knowledge of Akkadian, which he had learned from [[Archibald Sayce]]'s 1872 ''Assyrian Grammar for Comparative Purposes''.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=21}} Hamilton's book relied heavily on Smith's translation of the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'',{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=21}} but also made major changes.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=21}} For instance, Hamilton omitted the famous flood story entirely{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=21}} and instead focused on the romantic relationship between Ishtar and Gilgamesh.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=21}} ''Ishtar and Izdubar'' expanded the original roughly 3,000 lines of the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' to roughly 6,000 lines of rhyming couplets grouped into forty-eight [[canto]]s.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=21}} Hamilton significantly altered most of the characters and introduced entirely new episodes not found in the original

of the epic from the \"grim realism\" and \"ironic tragedy\" of the original to a \"cheery optimism\" filled with \"the sweet strains of love and harmony\".{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=23}}\n\nIn his 1904 book ''Das Alte Testament im Lichte des alten Orients'', the German Assyriologist [[Alfred Jeremias]] equated Gilgamesh with the king [[Nimrod]] from the Book of Genesis{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=26}} and argued that Gilgamesh's strength must come from his hair, like the hero [[Samson]] in the [[Book of Judges]],{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=26}} and that he must have performed [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labors]] like the hero [[Heracles]] in [[Greek mythology]].{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=26}} In his 1906 book ''Das Gilgamesch-Epos in der Weltliteratur'', the Orientalist [[Peter Jensen (Orientalist)|Peter Jensen]] declared that the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' was the source behind nearly all the stories in the Old Testament,{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=26}} arguing that [[Moses]] is \"the Gilgamesh of Exodus who saves the children of Israel from precisely the same situation faced by the inhabitants of Erech at the beginning of the Babylonian

Gilgamesh.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=26}} Finally, he declared that even [[Jesus]] is \"nothing but an Israelite Gilgamesh. Nothing but an adjunct to Abraham, Moses, and countless other figures in the saga.\"{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=26}} This ideology became known as [[Panbabylonianism]]{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=26\u201327}} and was almost immediately rejected by mainstream scholars.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=26\u201327}} The most stalwart critics of Panbabylonianism were those associated with the emerging ''[[Religionsgeschichtliche Schule]]''.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=27}} [[Hermann Gunkel]] dismissed most of Jensen's purported parallels between Gilgamesh and biblical figures as mere baseless sensationalism.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=27}} He concluded that Jensen and other Assyriologists like him had failed to understand the complexities of Old Testament scholarship{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=26\u201327}} and had confused scholars with \"conspicuous mistakes and remarkable aberrations\".{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=26\u201327}}\n\nIn English-speaking countries, the prevailing scholarly interpretation during the early twentieth century was one originally proposed by [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet]],{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=28}} which held that Gilgamesh is a \"solar hero\", whose actions represent the movements of the sun,{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=28}} and that the twelve tablets of his epic represent the twelve signs of the [[Babylonian zodiac]].{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=28}} The German psychologist [[Sigmund Freud]], drawing on the theories of [[James George Frazer]] and Paul Ehrenreich, interpreted Gilgamesh and Eabani (the earlier misreading for ''Enkidu'') as representing \"man\" and \"crude sensibility\" respectively.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=29}} He compared them to other brother-figures in world mythology,{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=29}} remarking, \"One is always weaker than the other and dies sooner. In Gilgamesh this ages-old motif of the unequal pair of brothers served to represent the relationship between a man and his [[libido]].\"{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=29}} He also saw Enkidu as representing the [[placenta]], the \"weaker twin\" who dies shortly after birth.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=29\u201330}} Freud's friend and pupil [[Carl Jung]] frequently discusses Gilgamesh in his early work ''Symbole der Wandlung'' (1911-1912).{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=30}} He, for instance, cites Ishtar's sexual attraction to Gilgamesh as an example of the mother's [[incest]]uous desire for her son,{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=30}} Humbaba as an example of an oppressive father-figure whom Gilgamesh must overcome,{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=30}} and Gilgamesh himself as an example of a man who forgets his dependence on [[Unconscious mind|the unconscious]] and is punished by the \"gods\", who represent it.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=30}}\n\n===Modern cultural significance===\n[[File:Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945.

G. Bridson|Douglas Geoffrey Bridson]], helped popularize the epic in Britain.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2011}} In the [[United States]], [[Charles Olson]] praised the epic in his poems and essays{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2011}} and [[Gregory Corso]] believed that it contained ancient virtues capable of curing what he viewed as modern moral degeneracy.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2011}} The 1966 postfigurative novel ''Gilgamesch'' by Guido Bachmann became a classic of German \"[[Gay literature|queer literature]]\"{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2011}} and set a decades-long international literary trend of portraying Gilgamesh and Enkidu as homosexual lovers.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2011}} This trend proved so popular that the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' itself is included in ''The Columbia Anthology of Gay Literature'' (1998) as a major early work of that genre.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2011}} In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Feminist literary criticism|feminist literary critics]] analyzed the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' as showing evidence for a transition from the [[Matriarchy#By chronology|original matriarchy of all humanity]] to modern [[patriarchy]].{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2011}} As the [[Green politics|Green Movement]] expanded in Europe, Gilgamesh's story began [[Ecocriticism|to be seen through an environmentalist lens]],{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2011}} with Enkidu's death symbolizing man's separation from nature.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2011}}\n\n[[File:Gilagmesh.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|A modern [[Statue of Gilgamesh, University of Sydney|statue of Gilgamesh]] stands at the [[University of Sydney]].{{sfn|Stone|2012}}]]\n\n[[Theodore Ziolkowski]], a scholar of modern literature, states, that \"unlike most other figures from myth, literature, and history, Gilgamesh has established himself as an autonomous entity or simply a name, often independent of the epic context in which he originally became known.

Wood himself was a cross-dresser, and the film is a plea for tolerance. It is widely considered [[List of films considered the worst|one of the worst films ever]]. However, it has become a [[cult film]] due to its low-budget production values and [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] style.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=April 2016}}\nThe film begins with a narrator, called The Scientist ([[Bela Lugosi]]), making cryptic comments about humanity. He first comments that humanity's constant search for the unknown results in startling things coming to light. But most of these \"new\" discoveries are actually quite old, which he refers to as \"the signs of the ages\". Later, the scene turns to the streets of a city, with the narrator commenting that each human has his/her own thoughts, ideas, and personality. He makes further comments on human life, while sounds accompany some comments. The cries of a newborn baby are followed by the sirens of an ambulance. One is a sign that a new life has begun, the other that a life has ended.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref><ref name=\"Radiation\">{{cite web |url= http://www.radiationcinema.com/2009/06/unbroken-dream-of-edward-d-wood-jr.html |title=''The Unbroken Dream of Edward D. Wood, Jr.' |date=  June 14, 2009 |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |author= Mykal |publisher=Radiation Cinema}}</ref>\n\nThis last comment starts the narrative of the film. The life which has ended is that of a [[Transvestism|transvestite]] named Patrick/Patricia, who has committed [[suicide]]. A scene opens with their corpse in a small room. Within the room is an unidentified man who opens the door to a physician, a photographer, and the police. A [[suicide note]] explains the reasons behind the suicide. Patrick/Patricia had been arrested four times for [[cross-dressing]] in public, and had spent time in prison. Since they would continue wearing women's clothing, subsequent arrests and imprisonment were only a matter of time. So they ended their own life and wished to be buried with their women's clothing. \"''Let my body rest in death forever, in the things I cannot wear in life.''\"<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref><ref name=\"Radiation\"/>\n\nInspector Warren is puzzled and wants to know more about cross-dressing. So he seeks the office of Dr. Alton, who narrates for him the story of Glen/Glenda. Glen is shown studying women's clothes in a shop window. Dr. Alton points out that men's clothes are dull and restrictive, whereas women can adorn themselves with attractive and comfortable clothing.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref><ref name=\"Radiation\"/> A flashback scene reveals that a young Glen started out by asking to wear his sister's dress for a [[Halloween]] party. And he did, despite his father's protests. But he then continued wearing his sister's clothing, and Sheila (the sister) eventually caught him in the act.  She shuns him afterward.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref>\n\nThe narrative explains that Glen is a transvestite, but not a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]. He hides his cross-dressing from his fianc\u00e9e, Barbara, fearing that she will reject him.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref><ref name=\"Radiation\"/> She has no idea that certain of her clothes are [[Sexual fetishism|fetish objects]] for him. When Barbara notices that something is bothering him, Glen does not have the courage to explain his secret to her. She voices her suspicion that there is another woman in his life, unaware that the woman is his feminine inner self, Glenda.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref> The scene shifts from a speechless Glen to footage of a stampeding herd of [[bison]], while the Scientist calls for Glen to ''\"Pull the string''\". The meaning of the call is unclear, though it could be a call for opening the proverbial curtain and revealing the truth.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref>\n\nAlton narrates that Glen is torn between the idea of being honest with Barbara before their wedding, or waiting until after. The narrative shifts briefly from Glen's story to how society reacts to [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex change operations]]. A conversation between two \"average joes\", concludes that society should be more \"lenient\" when it comes to people with tranvestite tendencies.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref> The story returns to Glen, who confides in a transvestite friend of his, John, whose wife left him after catching him wearing her clothes.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref>\n\nLater, a scene opens with Glen/Glenda walking the city streets at night. They return home in obvious anguish, when the sound of [[thunder]] causes them to collapse to the floor. The Scientist cryptically comments ''\"Beware! Beware! Beware of the big, green dragon that sits on your doorstep! He eats little boys, puppy dog tails, and big, fat snails! Take care! Beware!''\"<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref> This serves as the introduction to an extended [[dream sequence]]. The dream opens with Barbara anguished at seeing Glenda. Then Barbara is depicted trapped under a tree, while the room around is in a chaotic state. Glenda fails to lift the tree and rescue Barbara. Glenda is replaced by Glen, who completes the task with ease.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref> The dream then depicts Glen and Barbara getting married. The priest seems normal but the [[Groomsman|best man]] is a stereotypical [[devil]], smiling ominously, suggesting that this marriage is [[Damnation|damned]].<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref>  The dream shifts to the Scientist, who seems to speak to the unseen dragon, asking it what it eats. The voice of a little girl provides the answers in an apparently mocking tone.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref>\n\nThe dreams continues with a strange series of vignettes. A woman is [[whip]]ped by a shirtless man in a [[BDSM]]-themed vignette. Several women \"flirt and partially disrobe\" for an unseen audience.

This one concerns another tranvestite, called Alan/Ann. He was born a boy, but his mother wanted a girl and raised him as such. Their father did not care either way. They were an outsider as a child, trying to be one of the girls and consequently rejected by schoolmates of both sexes. As a teenager, they self-identified as a woman. They were [[Conscription|conscripted]] in [[World War II]], maintaining a secret life throughout their military service. They first heard of [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex change operations]] during the War while recovering from combat wounds in a hospital.  They eventually did have a sex change operation, enduring the associated pains to fulfill their dreams.

Wood was given the job, but instead made a movie about transvestism.\n\nWood persuaded Lugosi, at the time poor and [[drug addiction|drug-addicted]], to appear in the movie. Lugosi's scenes were shot at the Jack Miles Studios in [[Los Angeles]]. He was reportedly paid $5000 for the role, although some stories state the actual amount was only $1000.<ref name=\"rhodes\"/> Lugosi is credited as \"The Scientist\", a character whose purpose is unclear. He acts as a sort of narrator but gives no narration relevant to the plot; that job is reserved for the film's primary narrator, [[Timothy Farrell]].<ref name=\"Peary\"/>\n\nThis was the only film Wood directed but did not also produce. Wood played the eponymous character, but under the [[pseudonym]] \"Daniel Davis\".<ref name=\"Peary\">{{cite book | title = Cult Movies 3 | first = Danny | last = Peary | year = 1988 | publisher = Simon & Schuster Inc. | location = New York | pages = 97\u2013101 | isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}</ref> His then-girlfriend, [[Dolores Fuller]], played Glen's girlfriend/fianc\u00e9e Barbara. Wood later returned to ''Glen or Glenda'' in his [[pulp novel]] ''Killer in Drag'' (1963). The plot features a transvestite called Glen whose alter-ego is called Glenda. He is executed in the sequel ''Death of a Transvestite'' (1967) after a struggle for the right to go to the [[electric chair]] dressed as Glenda.\n\nThe erotic-themed vignettes were not created by Wood. They were reportedly added by producer [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]]. He needed extra scenes to add to what he felt was an overtly -short film.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref> While not organic parts of the narrative, they seem to tell their own tales of gender dynamics and so fit in the general themes of the film.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref> The [[whip]]ping scene suggests a [[Master/slave (BDSM)|Master/slave]] relationship.

In the theatrical trailer, included in [[laserdisc]] and [[DVD]] editions, the scene in which Fuller hands over her [[Angora wool|angora]] sweater, is a different take than the one in the release version \u2014 in the trailer, she tosses it to Wood in a huff, while the release version shows her handing it over more acceptingly. There is also a shot of Wood in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], mouthing the word \"Cut!\"\n\nThe second part of the film, titled ''Alan or Anne'', is much shorter, told largely through [[stock footage]], and was made to meet the distributor's demand for a [[sex change]] film. Alan is a [[Intersex|pseudo-hermaphrodite]] who fights in [[World War II]] wearing women's underwear. After his return, Alan undergoes surgery to become a woman.\n\n==Release==\nDomestically, the film was [[Limited release|limited in release]], having been pre-sold to some theaters (under alternative titles such including ''I Led Two Lives'', ''He or She?'' and ''I Changed My Sex''). Internationally, the film was also limited, and in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], the title was translated as ''Louis ou Louise'' and in [[Argentina]] as ''Yo Cambi\u00e9 Mi Sexo''; the film had a brief <!-- A few minutes? A few days? --> screening in the [[Republic of China]].<ref name=\"rhodes\"/>\n\nAccording to Tim Dirks, the film was one of a wave of \"cheap teen movies\" released for the [[Drive-in theater|drive-in market]].

This led to ''Glen or Glenda'' being reissued in 1982. This cut included six minutes of additional footage. One of the restored scenes features Glen rejecting a pass made to him by a man. At this point, the film was reviewed seriously, and reclaimed as a radical work, by Steve Jenkins in the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]''.\n\nThe critic [[Leonard Maltin]] names ''Glen or Glenda'' as \"possibly the worst movie ever made\".\n\nIn 1994, [[Tim Burton]] chronicled the troubled production of ''Glen or Glenda'' in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''. The film includes re-creations of several key scenes, including Lugosi's narration and Glen's plea for his girlfriend's understanding at the end of the film.\nA remake of the film, entitled ''Glen & Glenda'', was released the same year as ''Ed Wood'' and featured much the same script as the original film, as well as explicit scenes.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137784/ IMDB entry]</ref>\n\nIn the 2004 horror comedy film ''[[Seed of Chucky]]'', main characters [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] and [[Tiffany (Child's Play)|Tiffany]] spend the duration of the film feuding over whether they should call their male child \"Glen or Glenda\" as he lacks genitalia.\n\nIn 2006, the [[distributed operating system]] [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]] had a mascot, [[Glenda, the Plan 9 Bunny]], named after ''Glen or Glenda'' and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''.\n\nIn 2011, the film ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]'' was nominated for every award at the [[32nd Golden Raspberry Awards]], including Worst Prequel, Remake, Ripoff or Sequel, where it was declared a Remake/Ripoff of ''Glen or Glenda'', despite having nothing to do with the film, other than the lead actor dressed as a woman.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Transgender in film and television]]\n* [[Cross-dressing in film and television]]\n* [[List of films considered the worst]]\n* [[Ed Wood filmography]]\n\n==References==\n* {{citation | last1=Craig | first1=Rob| title=''Ed Wood, Mad Genius: A Critical Study of the Films'' | chapter=Glen or Glenda?

The book features many low-budget obscurities and exploitation films such as ''[[Rat Pfink a Boo Boo]]'', ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]'', and the apparently lost ''[[Him (film)|Him]]''. Other categories include expensive, big studio failures like ''[[The Swarm (film)|The Swarm]]'' and popular films such as ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.\n\nIn the introduction the authors admit that \"we know our choices will not please everyone&mdash;least of all the actors, producers, writers and directors who are honored in the pages that follow. We further recognize that the number of bad films is so enormous and the competition for the very worst is so intense, that all decisions reached here are subject to considerable second-guessing. Nevertheless, we have researched the subject thoroughly&mdash;sitting through more than 2,000 wretched films in the last few years&mdash;and we believe that our nominees and award winners can stand the test of time.\"\n\nThe Medveds had previously celebrated bad cinema in ''[[The Fifty Worst Films of All Time]]'', many of which were also featured in the various ''Golden Turkey Awards'' categories. Subsequently, they turned their attention to [[box office bomb]]s in ''[[The Hollywood Hall of Shame]]''. They also published a sequel to ''The Golden Turkey Awards'', ''[[Son of Golden Turkey Awards]],'' in 1986. They declared that ''Son of Golden Turkey Awards'' \"is our last word...we hereby solemnly pledge that the years ahead will produce no further Golden Turkey publications by the Medved Brothers...we now pass the torch to whichever brave souls feel ready to take up the challenge.\" ''Son of Golden Turkey Awards'' also listed a \"Who's Who in the World of Bad Movies\" at the end of its awards presentations.\n\nThe Golden Turkey Awards formed the basis of a 1983 television series ''[[The Worst of Hollywood]]'' hosted by Michael Medved.\n\n==Awards given==\nIn the book ''The Fifty Worst Films of All Time'' the authors invited readers to write in nominating their favorite \"worst films\". More than 3,000 ballots were received. Based on these votes, the Worst Film of All Time award was given to ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' by [[Ed Wood]].\n\nWood is also awarded the title of Worst Director of All Time, judged by the authors. \n[[Raquel Welch]] is judged the Worst Actress of All Time over nominees including [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Mamie van Doren]].\n\n[[Richard Burton]] is judged as the Worst Actor of All Time over nominees [[John Agar]], [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Victor Mature]]. While conceding he is sometimes brilliant, the authors claim Burton's \"occasional triumphs only serve to highlight the pathetic waste in most of his films; for every ''[[Equus (film)|Equus]]'' in which he appears there are at least a half-dozen ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''s or ''[[Boom! (1968 film)|Boom!]]''s. The authors state that \"when he is bad ... well, he's just the pits\" and list several \"bad\" films in which he has appeared: ''[[The Sandpiper]]'', ''[[Hammersmith Is Out]]'', ''[[The Voyage (film)|The Voyage]]'', ''[[The Medusa Touch]]'' and ''[[The Assassination of Trotsky]]''.

The fake film was ''Dog of Norway'' featuring \"Muki the Wonder Hound\". This film was illustrated using a photo of a co-author's dog. The giveaway was that the same dog was in the photo of the authors in the back of the book. Another film in the book, the now-lost 1974 porn film ''[[Him (film)|Him]]'', has also been cited as the hoax, though it is known to have existed.<ref>{{cite web |author=Mark Goodacre |authorlink=Mark Goodacre |date=May 19, 2005 |title=Gay Jesus Film Hoax? |work=NT Blog |url=http://ntweblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/gay-jesus-film-hoax.html |accessdate=2009-06-08 }}</ref>\n\nNo formal clarification of the hoax film was provided by the subsequent release, ''The Hollywood Hall of Shame''. That book again features the same dog pictured with the authors (as did the subsequent ''Son of Golden Turkey Awards''). In ''The Hollywood Hall of Shame'', in reference to the dish barbecued dog, the authors explain that it was \"a snack which produced a mixed reaction among the representatives of an industry that had given the world [[Lassie]], [[Rin Tin Tin]], [[Benji]], [[Phyllis Diller]], and Muki the Wonder Hound.\"<ref>Harry Medved and [[Michael Medved]].

The son of a [[Leicestershire]] [[Weaver (occupation)|weaver]], he lived in times of social upheaval and war. He rebelled against the [[Religion|religious]] and political authorities by proposing an unusual, uncompromising approach to the [[Christianity|Christian faith]]. He travelled throughout Britain as a dissenting preacher, often being persecuted by the disapproving authorities. In 1669, he married [[Margaret Fell]], widow of a wealthy supporter, [[Thomas Fell]]; she was a leading Friend. His ministry expanded and he made tours of [[North America]] and the [[Low Countries]]. He was arrested and jailed numerous times for his beliefs. He spent his final decade working in London to organize the expanding Quaker movement. Despite disdain from some Anglicans and Puritans, he was viewed with respect by the Quaker convert [[William Penn]] and the Lord Protector, [[Oliver Cromwell]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:George-fox-fenny-drayton-memorial-inscription.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to Fox's birthplace, situated on George Fox Lane in [[Fenny Drayton]], England]]\n\nGeorge Fox was born in the strongly [[Puritan]] village of Drayton-in-the-Clay, Leicestershire, England (now known as [[Fenny Drayton]]), 15&nbsp;miles (24&nbsp;km) west-south-west of [[Leicester]]. He was the eldest of four children of Christopher Fox, a successful [[weaving|weaver]], called \"Righteous Christer\"<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.1</ref> by his neighbours, and his wife, Mary {{n\u00e9e}} Lago. Christopher Fox was a churchwarden and was relatively wealthy; when he died in the late 1650s he left his son a substantial legacy.<ref name=ingle>Ingle (2004)</ref> From childhood Fox was of a serious, religious disposition. There is no record of any formal schooling but he learned to read and write. \"When I came to eleven years of age\", he said, \"I knew pureness and righteousness; for, while I was a child, I was taught how to walk to be kept pure. The Lord taught me to be faithful, in all things, and to act faithfully two ways; viz., inwardly to God, and outwardly to man.\"<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.1\u20132 and Jones, chapter 1</ref> Known as an honest person, he also proclaimed, \"The Lord taught me to be faithful in all things...and to keep to Yea and Nay in all things.\"<ref>The Quakers, Money & Morals, James Walvin, Pg. 8</ref>\n\nAs he grew up, his relatives \"thought to have made me a priest\" but he was instead apprenticed to a local [[shoemaking|shoemaker]] and [[Pastoral farming|grazier]], George Gee of [[Mancetter]].<ref>Nickalls, p.2 and Ingle (2004)</ref> This suited his contemplative temperament and he became well known for his diligence among the wool traders who had dealings with his master. A constant obsession for Fox was the pursuit of \"simplicity\" in life, meaning humility and the abandonment of luxury, and the short time he spent as a [[shepherd]] was important to the formation of this view. Toward the end of his life he wrote a letter for general circulation pointing out that [[Cain and Abel|Abel]], [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Jacob]], [[Moses]] and [[David]] were all keepers of sheep or cattle and therefore that a learned education should not be seen as a necessary qualification for ministry.<ref>Marsh 1847, p.364</ref>\n\nGeorge Fox knew people who were \"professors\" (followers of the standard religion), but by the age of 19 he had begun to look down on their behaviour, in particular drinking alcohol. He records that, in prayer one night after leaving two acquaintances at a drinking session, he heard an inner voice saying, \"Thou seest how young people go together into vanity, and old people into the earth; thou must forsake all, young and old, keep out of all, and be as a stranger unto all.\"<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.3 and Jones, chapter 1</ref>\n\n==First travels==\nDriven by his \"inner voice\", Fox left Drayton-in-the-Clay in September 1643, moving toward London in a state of mental torment and confusion. The [[English Civil War]] had begun and troops were stationed in many towns through which he passed.<ref name=ingle/> In [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], he was torn by depression (perhaps from the temptations of the resort town near London). He alternately shut himself in his room for days at a time or went out alone into the countryside. After almost a year he returned to Drayton, where he engaged [[Nathaniel Stephens (clergyman)|Nathaniel Stephens]], the clergyman of his hometown, in long discussions on religious matters.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.5</ref> Stephens considered Fox a gifted young man but the two disagreed on so many issues that he later called Fox mad and spoke against him.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.48</ref>\n\nOver the next few years Fox continued to travel around the country as his particular religious beliefs took shape. At times he actively sought the company of clergy but found no comfort from them as they seemed unable to help with the matters troubling him. One, in [[Warwickshire]], advised him to take [[tobacco]] (which Fox disliked) and sing [[psalms]]; another, in [[Coventry]], lost his temper when Fox accidentally stood on a flower in his garden; a third suggested [[bloodletting]].<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.5\u20136</ref> He became fascinated by the [[Bible]], which he studied assiduously.<ref>Fox in e.g. Nickalls, p.9</ref> He hoped to find among the \"[[English Dissenters]]\" a spiritual understanding absent from the established church but fell out with one group, for example, because he maintained that women had souls:<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.8\u20139, 11</ref>\n\n{{quote|as I had forsaken the priests, so I left the separate preachers also, and those esteemed the most experienced people; for I saw there was none among them all that could speak to my condition. And when all my hopes in them and in all men were gone, so that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what to do, then, oh, then, I heard a voice which said, \"There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition\"; and when I heard it my heart did leap for joy. Then the Lord let me see why there was none upon the earth that could speak to my condition, namely, that I might give Him all the glory; for all are concluded under sin, and shut up in unbelief as I had been, that Jesus Christ might have the pre-eminence who enlightens, and gives grace, and faith, and power. Thus when God doth work, who shall let ''(i.e. prevent)'' it? And this I knew experimentally.<ref>Quaker Faith and Practice \u00a719.02</ref><ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.11</ref>}}\n[[File:AssemblyOfQuakers.jpg|thumb|right|A Quaker woman preaches at a meeting in London.]]\nHe thought intensely about the [[Temptation of Christ]], which he compared to his own spiritual condition, but drew strength from his conviction that God would support and preserve him.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.12</ref> In prayer and meditation he came to a greater understanding of the nature of his faith and what it required from him; this process he called \"opening\". He also came to what he deemed a deep inner understanding of standard Christian beliefs. Among his ideas were:\n\n*Rituals can be safely ignored, as long as one experiences a true spiritual conversion.\n*The qualification for ministry is given by the [[Holy Spirit]], not by ecclesiastical study. This implies that anyone has the right to minister, assuming the Spirit guides them, including women and children.<ref name=ingle/>\n*God \"dwelleth in the hearts of his obedient people\": religious experience is not confined to a [[Church (building)|church building]]. Indeed, Fox refused to apply the word \"church\" to a building, using instead the name \"steeple-house\", a usage maintained by many Quakers today. Fox would just as soon worship in fields and orchards, believing that God's presence could be felt anywhere.<ref>Fox in e.g. Nickalls, pp.8, 24, 40, 85, 126</ref>\n*Though Fox used the Bible to support his views, Fox reasoned that, because God was within the faithful, believers could follow their own inner guide rather than rely on a strict reading of Scripture or the word of clerics.<ref name=ingle/><ref>See e.g. Fox in Nickalls, pp.145, 159</ref>\n*Fox also made no clear distinction between Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<ref name=ingle/>\n\n==Religious Society of Friends==\nIn 1647 Fox began to preach publicly:<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.18\u201319</ref> in market-places, fields, appointed meetings of various kinds or even sometimes \"steeple-houses\" after the service. His powerful preaching began to attract a small following. It is not clear at what point the Society of Friends was formed but there was certainly a group of people who often travelled together. At first, they called themselves \"Children of the Light\" or \"Friends of the Truth\", and later simply \"Friends\". Fox seems to have initially had no desire to found a sect but only to proclaim what he saw as the pure and genuine principles of [[Christianity]] in their original simplicity, though he afterward showed great prowess as a religious organisor in the structure he gave to the new society.\n\nThere were a great many rival [[Christian denomination]]s holding very diverse opinions; the atmosphere of dispute and confusion gave Fox an opportunity to put forward his own beliefs through his personal sermons. Fox's preaching was grounded in scripture but was mainly effective because of the intense personal experience he was able to project.<ref name=ingle/> He was scathing about immorality, deceit and the exacting of [[tithe]]s and urged his listeners to lead lives without sin,<ref>Fox in e.g. Nickalls, p.91</ref> avoiding the [[Ranters|Ranter]]'s [[antinomian]] view that a believer becomes automatically sinless. By 1651 he had gathered other talented preachers around him and continued to roam the country despite a harsh reception from some listeners, who would whip and beat them to drive them away.<ref>See e.g. Fox in Nickalls, pp.44, 48, 97\u201398, 120, 127\u2013131</ref> As his reputation spread, his words were not welcomed by all. As an uncompromising preacher, he hurled disputation and contradiction to the faces of his opponents.<ref>The Quakers, Money & Morals, James Walvin, Pg. 11</ref> The worship of Friends in the form of silent waiting punctuated by individuals speaking as the Spirit moved them seems to have been well-established by this time,<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.79</ref> though it is not recorded how this came to be; [[Richard Bauman]] asserts that \"speaking was an important feature of the meeting for worship from the earliest days of Quakerism.\"<ref>Bauman, 124.</ref>\n\n===Imprisonment===\nFox complained to judges about decisions he considered morally wrong, as in his letter on the case of a woman due to be [[Capital punishment|executed]] for theft.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.66</ref> He campaigned against the paying of tithes, which funded the established church and often went into the pockets of absentee landlords or religious colleges far away from the paying parishioners. In his view, as God was everywhere and anyone could preach, the established church was unnecessary and a university qualification irrelevant for a preacher.<ref name=ingle/> Conflict with civil authority was inevitable. Fox was imprisoned several times, the first at [[Nottingham]] in 1649.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.40\u201343</ref> At [[Derby]] in 1650 he was imprisoned for [[blasphemy]]; a judge mocked Fox's exhortation to \"tremble at the word of the Lord\", calling him and his followers \"Quakers\".<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.52\u201358 and Jones, chapter 4</ref> Following his refusal to fight against the return of the monarchy (or to take up arms for any reason), his sentence was doubled.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.64\u201365</ref> The refusal to swear oaths or take up arms came to be a much more important part of his public statements. Refusal to take oaths meant that Quakers could be prosecuted under laws compelling subjects to [[Oath of allegiance|pledge allegiance]], as well as making testifying in court problematic.<ref name=ingle/> In a letter of 1652 (''That which is set up by the sword''), he urged Friends not to use \"carnal weapons\" but \"spiritual weapons\", saying \"let the waves [the power of nations] break over your heads\".\n\nIn 1652, Fox preached for several hours under a walnut tree at [[Balby]], where his disciple [[Thomas Aldham]] was instrumental in setting up the first meeting in the [[Doncaster]] area.<ref>Doncaster Friends site: [http://homepages.tesco.net/~d.swift/Doncaster.htm Retrieved 30 September 2011.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210205852/http://homepages.tesco.net/~d.swift/Doncaster.htm |date=10 December 2011 }}</ref> In the same year Fox felt that God led him to ascend [[Pendle Hill]] where he had a vision of many souls coming to Christ. From there he travelled to [[Sedbergh]], where he had heard a group of [[Seekers]] were meeting, and preached to over a thousand people on [[Firbank Fell]], convincing many, including [[Francis Howgill]], to accept that Christ might speak to people directly.<ref>Nickalls, pp.103\u2013108</ref> At the end of the month he stayed at [[Swarthmoor Hall]], near [[Ulverston]], the home of Thomas Fell, vice-chancellor of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], and his wife, Margaret. At around this time the ''ad hoc'' meetings of Friends began to be formalized and a monthly meeting was set up in [[County Durham]].<ref name=ingle/> Margaret became a Quaker and, although Thomas did not convert, his familiarity with the Friends proved influential when Fox was arrested for blasphemy in October. Fell was one of three presiding judges, and had the charges dismissed on a technicality.\n\nFox remained at [[Swarthmoor]] until summer 1653 then left for [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] where he was arrested again for blasphemy.<ref name=ingle/> It was even proposed to put him to death but [[Barebone's Parliament|Parliament]] requested his release rather than have \"a young man&nbsp;... die for religion\".<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.159\u2013164 and Jones, chapter 7</ref> Further imprisonments came at [[London]], England in 1654, [[Launceston, England|Launceston]] in 1656, [[Lancaster, England|Lancaster]] in 1660, [[Leicester]] in 1662, Lancaster again and [[Scarborough, England|Scarborough]] in 1664\u20131666 and [[Worcester, England|Worcester]] in 1673\u20131675. Charges usually included causing a disturbance and travelling without a pass. Quakers fell foul of irregularly enforced laws forbidding unauthorized worship while actions motivated by belief in social equality\u2014refusing to use or acknowledge titles, take hats off in court or bow to those who considered themselves socially superior\u2014were seen as disrespectful.<ref>Fox in e.g. Nickalls, pp.36\u201337, 243\u2013244</ref> While imprisoned at Launceston Fox wrote, \"Christ our Lord and master saith 'Swear not at all, but let your communications be yea, yea, and nay, nay, for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.'&nbsp;... the Apostle James saith, 'My brethren, above all things swear not, neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor by any other oath. Lest ye fall into condemnation.'\"<ref>Fox in e.g. Nickalls, pp.244\u2013245</ref>\n\nIn prison George Fox continued writing and preaching, feeling that imprisonment brought him into contact with people who needed his help\u2014the jailers as well as his fellow prisoners. In his journal, he told his magistrate, \"God dwells not in temples made with hands.\"<ref>Journal of George Fox (1694), Chapter 4</ref> He also sought to set an example by his actions there, turning the other cheek when being beaten and refusing to show his captors any dejected feelings.\n\n===Encounters with Cromwell===\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell - Statue - Palace of Westminster - London - 240404.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cromwell was sympathetic to Fox and almost agreed to follow his teaching\u2014but persecution of Quakers continued.]]\n\nParliamentarians grew suspicious of monarchist plots and fearful that the group travelling with Fox aimed to overthrow the government: by this time his meetings were regularly attracting crowds of over a thousand. In early 1655 he was arrested at [[Whetstone, Leicestershire]] and taken to London under armed guard. In March<ref>Ingle (2004) says 9 March; Nickalls, p.199 says 6 March.</ref> he was brought before the [[Lord Protector]], [[Oliver Cromwell]]. After affirming that he had no intention of taking up arms Fox was able to speak with Cromwell for most of the morning about the Friends and advised him to listen to God's voice and obey it so that, as Fox left, Cromwell \"with tears in his eyes said, 'Come again to my house; for if thou and I were but an hour of a day together, we should be nearer one to the other'; adding that he wished [Fox] no more ill than he did to his own soul.\"<ref>Fox in Jones, chapter 8 and Nickalls, p.199</ref>\n\nThis episode was later recalled as an example of \"speaking truth to power\", a preaching technique by which subsequent Quakers hoped to influence the powerful.<ref>Tolles, Frederick Barnes (1956). [http://www.quaker.org/pamphlets/ward1956a.html ''The Ward Lecture 1956: Quakerism and Politics''.] Quaker Pamphlets.</ref> Although not used until the 20th century, the phrase is related to the ideas of plain speech and simplicity which Fox practiced, but motivated by the more worldly goal of eradicating war, injustice and oppression.\n\nFox petitioned Cromwell over the course of 1656, asking him to alleviate the persecution of Quakers.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.220\u2013221, 254</ref> Later that year, they met for a second time at Whitehall. On a personal level, the meeting went well; despite disagreements between the two men, they had a certain rapport. Fox invited Cromwell to \"lay down his crown at the feet of Jesus\"\u2014which Cromwell declined to do.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.274 and Jones, chapter 10</ref> Fox met Cromwell again twice in March 1657.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.289</ref> Their last meeting was in 1658 at [[Hampton Court]], though they could not speak for long or meet again because of the Protector's worsening illness\u2014Fox even wrote that \"he looked like a dead man\".<ref>Fox in Jones, chapter 12 and Nickalls, p.350</ref> Cromwell died in September of that year.\n\n===James Nayler===\nOne early Quaker convert, the Yorkshireman [[James Nayler]], arose as a prominent preacher in London around 1655. A breach began to form between Fox's and Nayler's followers. As Fox was held prisoner at Launceston, Nayler moved south-westwards towards Launceston intending to meet Fox and heal any rift. On the way he was arrested himself and held at [[Exeter]]. After Fox was released from Launceston gaol in 1656, he preached throughout the [[West Country]]. Arriving at Exeter late in September, Fox was reunited with Nayler. Nayler and his followers refused to remove their hats while Fox prayed, which Fox took as both a personal slight and a bad example. When Nayler refused to kiss Fox's hand, Fox told Nayler to kiss his foot instead. Nayler was offended and the two parted acrimoniously. Fox wrote, \"there was now a wicked spirit risen amongst Friends\".<ref>Ingle (2004) and Fox in Nickalls, p.268</ref>\n\nAfter Nayler's own release later the same year he rode into [[Bristol]] triumphantly playing the part of Jesus Christ in a re-enactment of [[Palm Sunday]]. He was arrested and taken to London, where Parliament defeated a motion to execute him by 96\u201382. Instead, they ordered that he be pilloried and whipped through both London and Bristol, branded on his forehead with the letter B (for blasphemer), bored through the tongue with a red-hot iron and imprisoned in solitary confinement with hard labour.<ref>Jones, footnote 125, chapter 10</ref> Nayler was released in 1659, but he was a broken man. On meeting Fox in London, he fell to his knees and begged Fox's forgiveness. Shortly afterward, Nayler was attacked by thieves while travelling home to his family, and died.<ref name=ingle/>\n\n==Suffering and growth==\n[[File:George Fox.jpg|thumb|left|19th-century engraving of George Fox, based on a painting of unknown date]]\nThe persecutions of these years\u2014with about a thousand Friends in prison by 1657\u2014hardened Fox's opinions of traditional religious and social practices. In his preaching, he often emphasized the Quaker rejection of [[baptism]] by water; this was a useful way of highlighting how the focus of Friends on inward transformation differed from what he saw as the superstition of outward ritual. It was also deliberately provocative to adherents of those practices, providing opportunities for Fox to argue with them on matters of scripture. This pattern was also found in his court appearances: when a judge challenged him to remove his hat, Fox riposted by asking where in the Bible such an injunction could be found.\n\nThe Society of Friends became increasingly organized towards the end of the decade. Large meetings were held, including a three-day event in Bedfordshire, the precursor of the present [[Britain Yearly Meeting]] system.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.339</ref> Fox commissioned two Friends to travel around the country collecting the testimonies of imprisoned Quakers, as evidence of their persecution; this led to the establishment in 1675 of [[Meeting for Sufferings]], which has continued to the present day.<ref>Quaker Faith and Practice \u00a77</ref>\n\nThe 1650s, when the Friends were most confrontational, was one of the most creative periods of their history. During the Commonwealth, Fox had hoped that the movement would become the major church in England. Disagreements, persecution and increasing social turmoil, however, led Fox to suffer from a severe depression, which left him deeply troubled at [[Reading, Berkshire]], for ten weeks in 1658 or 1659.<ref>Nickalls, pp.353\u2013355 and Ingle (2004)</ref> In 1659, he sent [[Rump Parliament|parliament]] his most politically radical pamphlet, ''[[Fifty nine Particulars laid down for the Regulating things]]'', but the year was so chaotic that it never considered them; the document was not reprinted until the 21st century.<ref name=ingle/>\n\n===The Restoration===\nWith the [[English Restoration|restoration of the monarchy]], Fox's dreams of establishing the Friends as the dominant religion seemed at an end. He was again accused of conspiracy, this time against [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and fanaticism\u2014a charge he resented. He was imprisoned in Lancaster for five months, during which he wrote to the king offering advice on governance: Charles should refrain from war and domestic religious persecution, and discourage oath-taking, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], and [[maypole]] games. These last suggestions reveal Fox's [[Puritan]] leanings, which continued to influence Quakers for centuries after his death. Once again, Fox was released after demonstrating that he had no military ambitions.\n\nAt least on one point, Charles listened to Fox. The seven hundred Quakers who had been imprisoned under [[Richard Cromwell]] were released, though the government remained uncertain about the group's links with other, more violent, movements. A revolt by the [[Fifth Monarchists]] in January 1661 led to the suppression of that sect and the repression of other [[Nonconformist]]s, including Quakers.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.394\u2013395 and Jones, chapter 14</ref> In the aftermath of this attempted coup, Fox and eleven other Quakers issued a broadside proclaiming what became known among Friends in the 20th century as the \"peace testimony\": they committed themselves to oppose all outward wars and strife as contrary to the will of God. Not all his followers accepted this statement; [[Isaac Penington (Quaker)|Isaac Penington]], for example, dissented for a time arguing that the state had a duty to protect the innocent from evil, if necessary by using military force. Despite the testimony, persecution against Quakers and other dissenters continued.<ref name=ingle/>\n\nPenington and others, such as John Perrot and John Pennyman, were uneasy at Fox's increasing power within the movement. Like Nayler before them, they saw no reason why men should remove their hats for prayer, arguing that men and women should be treated as equals and if, as according to the apostle Paul, women should cover their heads, then so could men. Perrot and Penington lost the argument. Perrot emigrated to the New World, and Fox retained leadership of the movement.<ref name=ingle/>\n\nParliament enacted laws which forbade non-Anglican religious meetings of more than five people, essentially making Quaker meetings illegal. Fox counseled his followers to openly violate laws that attempted to suppress the movement, and many Friends, including women and children, were jailed over the next two and a half decades. Meanwhile, Quakers in [[New England]] had been banished (and some [[Boston martyrs|executed]]), and Charles was advised by his councillors to issue a [[mandamus]] condemning this practice and allowing them to return.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.411\u2013414</ref> Fox was able to meet some of the New England Friends when they came to London, stimulating his interest in the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]]. Fox was unable to travel there immediately: he was imprisoned again in 1664 for his refusal to swear the oath of allegiance, and on his release in 1666 was preoccupied with organizational matters\u2014he normalized the system of monthly and quarterly meetings throughout the country, and extended it to Ireland.\n\nVisiting Ireland also gave him the opportunity to preach against what he saw as the excesses of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], in particular the use of ritual. More recent Quaker commentators have noted points of contact between the denominations: both claim the actual presence of God in their meetings, and both allow the collective opinion of the church to augment Biblical teaching. Fox, however, did not perceive this, brought up as he was in a wholly [[Protestantism|Protestant]] environment hostile to \"Popery\".\n\nFox married [[Margaret Fell]] of [[Swarthmoor Hall]], a lady of high social position and one of his early converts, on 27 October 1669 at a meeting in Bristol. She was ten years his senior and had eight children (all but one of them Quakers) by her first husband, Thomas Fell, who had died in 1658. She was herself very active in the movement, and had campaigned for equality and the acceptance of women as preachers. As there were no priests at Quaker weddings to perform the ceremony, the union took the form of a civil marriage approved by the principals and the witnesses at a meeting. Ten days after the marriage, Margaret returned to Swarthmoor to continue her work there while George went back to London.<ref>Margaret wrote in her testimony, published in Ellwood's 1694 edition of Fox's journal, \"we were very willing, both of us, to live apart for some years upon God's account and his Truth's service, and to deny ourselves of that comfort which we might have had in being together, for the sake and service of the Lord and his Truth. And if any took occasion, or judged hard of us because of that, the Lord will judge them; for we were innocent.\"</ref> Their shared religious work was at the heart of their life together, and they later collaborated on a great deal of the administration the Society required. Shortly after the marriage, Margaret was imprisoned at Lancaster;<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.557</ref> George remained in the south-east of England, becoming so ill and depressed that for a time he lost his sight.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.569\u2013571</ref>\n\n===Travels in America and Europe===\n{{wikisource|Letter to the Governor of Barbados, 1671}}\n\n[[File:George Fox Stone, Flushing, NY IMG 3655.JPG|225px|right|thumb|This stone in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[New York (state)|New York]], located across from the [[John Bowne]] House commemorates the place where George Fox preached a sermon on 7 June 1672.]]\n\nBy 1671 Fox had recovered and Margaret had been released by order of the King. Fox resolved to visit the English settlements in America and the West Indies, remaining there for two years, possibly to counter any remnants of Perrot's teaching there.<ref name=ingle/> After a voyage of seven weeks, during which dolphins were caught and eaten, the party arrived in [[Barbados]] on 3 October 1671.<ref>Diary of John Hull, quoted in Nickalls, pp.580\u2013592</ref> From there, Fox sent an [[Epistle (Quaker)|epistle]] to Friends spelling out the role of women's meetings in the Quaker marriage ceremony, a point of controversy when he returned home. One of his proposals suggested that the prospective couple should be interviewed by an all-female meeting prior to the marriage to determine whether there were any financial or other impediments. Though women's meetings had been held in London for the last ten years, this was an innovation in Bristol and the north-west of England, which many there felt went too far.<ref name=ingle/>\n\nFox wrote a letter to the governor and assembly of the island in which he refuted charges that Quakers were stirring up the slaves to revolt and tried to affirm the orthodoxy of Quaker beliefs. After a stay in [[Jamaica]], Fox's first landfall on the [[North America|North American continent]] was at [[Maryland]], where he participated in a four-day meeting of local Quakers. He remained there while various of his English companions travelled to the other colonies, because he wished to meet some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who were interested in Quaker ways\u2014though he relates that they had \"a great dispute\" among themselves about whether to participate in the meeting. Fox was impressed by their general demeanour, which he said was \"courteous and loving\".<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.618; Jones, chapter 18, using alternate sources, has \"a great debate\" and \"carried themselves very courteously and lovingly\".</ref> He resented the suggestion (from a man in [[North Carolina]]) that \"the Light and Spirit of God&nbsp;... was not in the Indians\", a proposition which Fox refuted.<ref>Fox in Jones, chapter 18; Nickalls, p.642, has more complicated wording but the same meaning.</ref> Fox left no record of encountering slaves on the mainland.\n\nElsewhere in the colonies, Fox helped to establish organizational systems for the Friends, along the same lines as he had done in Britain.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.621</ref> He also preached to many non-Quakers, some but not all of whom were converted.\n\n[[File:AmsterdamDamsquar.jpg|thumb|right|Fox established a Yearly Meeting in [[Amsterdam]] for Friends in the Netherlands and German states.]]\n\nFollowing extensive travels around the various American colonies, George Fox returned to England in June 1673 confident that his movement was firmly established there. Back in England, however, he found his movement sharply divided among provincial Friends (such as William Rogers, John Wilkinson and John Story) who resisted establishment of women's meetings and the power of those who resided in or near London. With [[William Penn]] and [[Robert Barclay]] as allies of Fox, the challenge to Fox's leadership was eventually put down.<ref name=ingle/> But in the midst of the dispute, Fox was imprisoned again for refusing to swear oaths after being captured at [[Armscote]], [[Worcestershire]].<ref>Though now in [[Warwickshire]], until the re-arrangement of county boundaries in the twentieth century Armscote was in an outlying part of Worcestershire.</ref> His mother died shortly after hearing of his arrest and Fox's health began to suffer.<ref>Fox in Nickalls, pp.666\u2013676</ref> Margaret Fell petitioned the king for his release,<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.701</ref> which was granted,<ref>Fox in Nickalls, p.705</ref> but Fox felt too weak to take up his travels immediately. Recuperating at Swarthmoor, he began dictating what would be published after his death as his journal and devoted his time to his written output: letters, both public and private, as well as books and essays.<ref>[[Henry Cadbury|Cadbury, Henry J.]] (1952) \"George Fox's Later Years\" in Nickalls, pp.713\u2013756</ref> Much of his energy was devoted to the topic of oaths, having become convinced of its importance to Quaker ideas. By refusing to swear, he felt that he could bear witness to the value of truth in everyday life, as well as to God, whom he associated with truth and the [[inner light]].\n\nFor three months in 1677 and a month in 1684, Fox visited the Friends in the [[Netherlands]], and organized their meetings for discipline. The first trip was the more extensive, taking him into what is now Germany, proceeding along the coast to [[Friedrichstadt]] and back again over several days. Meanwhile, Fox was participating in a dispute among Friends in Britain over the role of women in meetings, a struggle which took much of his energy and left him exhausted. Returning to England, he stayed in the south in order to try to end the dispute. He followed the foundation of the colony of [[Pennsylvania]], where Penn had given him over {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of land, with interest.<ref name=ingle/> Persecution continued, with Fox arrested briefly in October 1683. Fox's health was becoming worse, but he continued his activities\u2014writing to leaders in [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], and elsewhere about his beliefs, and their treatment of Quakers.\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:George Fox marker Bunhill Fields.jpg|thumb|George Fox's marker in [[Quaker Gardens, Islington|Bunhill Fields]], next to the Meeting House<ref>\"Eleventh month 1690\" is \"January 1691\" in modern reckoning. In the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] calendar used at the time, the new year started on 25 March, and Quakers numbered the months to avoid using \"heathen\" names.</ref>]]\nIn the last years of his life, Fox continued to participate in the London Meetings, and still made representations to Parliament about the sufferings of Friends. The new King, [[James II of England|James II]], pardoned religious dissenters jailed for failure to attend the established church, leading to the release of about 1,500 Friends. Though the Quakers lost influence after the [[Glorious Revolution]], which deposed James II, the [[Act of Toleration 1689]] put an end to the uniformity laws under which Quakers had been persecuted, permitting them to assemble freely.\n\nTwo days after preaching, as usual, at the [[Gracechurch Street]] Meeting House in London, George Fox died between 9 and 10 p.m. on 13 January 1691. He was interred in the [[Quaker Gardens, Islington|Quaker Burying Ground]], Bunhill Fields, three days later in the presence of thousands of mourners.<ref>Robert Barrow's account quoted in Nickalls, p.760 estimates four thousand; Ellwood says \"a very great number\"; Ingle (2004) says \"thousands\"</ref>\n\n==Journal and letters==\nFox's journal was first published in 1694, after editing by [[Thomas Ellwood]]\u2014a friend and associate of [[John Milton]]\u2014with a preface by [[William Penn]]. Like most similar works of its time the journal was not written contemporaneously to the events it describes, but rather compiled many years later, much of it dictated. Parts of the journal were not in fact by Fox at all but are constructed by its editors from diverse sources and written as if by him.<ref>See for example, Nickalls, pp.536, 580, 594</ref> The dissent within the movement and the contributions of others to the development of Quakerism are largely excluded from the narrative. Fox portrays himself as always in the right and always vindicated by God's interventions on his behalf.<ref name=ingle/> As a religious autobiography, [[Rufus Jones (writer)|Rufus Jones]] compared it to such works as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' and [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]''. It is, though, an intensely personal work with little dramatic power that only succeeds in appealing to readers after substantial editing. Historians have used it as a primary source because of its wealth of detail on ordinary life in the 17th century, and the many towns and villages which Fox visited.<ref>[[Rufus Jones (writer)|Jones, Rufus M.]] (1908) \"Preface\" in Jones's version of Fox's journal</ref>\n\nHundreds of Fox's letters\u2014mostly intended for wide circulation, along with a few private communications\u2014were also published. Written from the 1650s onwards, with such titles as ''Friends, seek the peace of all men'' or ''To Friends, to know one another in the light'', they give enormous insight into the detail of Fox's beliefs, and show his determination to spread them. These writings, in the words of [[Henry Cadbury]], Professor of Divinity at [[Harvard University]] and a leading Quaker, \"contain a few fresh phrases of his own, [but] are generally characterized by an excess of scriptural language and today they seem dull and repetitious\".<ref>Cadbury, Henry J. (1967). \"Fox, George\". ''Collier's Encyclopedia''. Crowell Collier and Macmillan, Inc. Vol.10 p.243</ref> Others point out that \"Fox's sermons, rich in biblical metaphor and common speech, brought hope in a dark time.\"<ref>George Fox University (19 March 2008). [http://www.georgefox.edu/about/georgefox/leadership.html \"Spiritual Leadership of George Fox\"]. Retrieved 12 May 2008.</ref> Fox's aphorisms have found an audience beyond Quakers, with many other church groups using them to illustrate principles of Christianity.\n\nFox is described by Ellwood as \"graceful in countenance, manly in personage, grave in gesture, courteous in conversation\". Penn says he was \"civil beyond all forms of breeding\". We are told that he was \"plain and powerful in preaching, fervent in prayer\", \"a discerner of other men's spirits, and very much master of his own\", skilful to \"speak a word in due season to the conditions and capacities of most, especially to them that were weary, and wanted soul's rest\"; \"valiant in asserting the truth, bold in defending it, patient in suffering for it, immovable as a rock\".<ref>1694 Journal front matter</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nFox's influence on the Society of Friends was tremendous, and his beliefs have largely been carried forward by that group. Perhaps his most significant achievement, other than his predominant influence in the early movement, was his leadership in overcoming the twin challenges of government prosecution after the Restoration and internal disputes that threatened its stability during the same period. Not all of his beliefs were welcome to all Quakers: his Puritan-like opposition to the arts<ref>Fox in e.g. Nickalls, pp.37\u201338</ref> and rejection of [[theology|theological]] study, forestalled development of these practices among Quakers for some time.\n\nThe name of George Fox is often invoked by traditionalist Friends who dislike modern liberal attitudes to the Society's Christian origins. At the same time, Quakers and others can relate to Fox's religious experience, and even those who disagree with many of his ideas regard him as a pioneer.\n\n[[Walt Whitman]], who was raised by parents inspired by Quaker principles, later wrote: \"George Fox stands for something too\u2014a thought\u2014the thought that wakes in silent hours\u2014perhaps the deepest, most eternal thought latent in the human soul. This is the thought of God, merged in the thoughts of moral right and the immortality of identity.

Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under King James had faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow plotters were [[John and Christopher Wright|John Wright]], [[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Thomas Wintour]], [[Thomas Percy (Gunpowder Plot)|Thomas Percy]], [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Robert Keyes]], [[Thomas Bates]], [[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Robert Wintour]], [[John and Christopher Wright|Christopher Wright]], [[John Grant (Gunpowder Plot)|John Grant]], [[Ambrose Rookwood]], [[Everard Digby|Sir Everard Digby]] and [[Francis Tresham]].  Fawkes, who had 10&nbsp;years of military experience fighting in the [[Southern Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands]] in the failed suppression of the [[Dutch Revolt]], was given charge of the explosives.\n\nThe plot was revealed to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent to [[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle|William Parker, 4th&nbsp;Baron Monteagle]], on 26&nbsp;October 1605. During a search of the House of Lords at about midnight on 4&nbsp;November 1605, Fawkes was discovered guarding 36&nbsp;barrels of [[gunpowder]]\u2014enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble\u2014and arrested. Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned of the plot's discovery, trying to enlist support along the way. Several made a stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men at [[Holbeche House]]; in the ensuing battle, Catesby was one of those shot and killed. At their trial on 27&nbsp;January 1606, eight of the survivors, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].\n\nDetails of the assassination attempt were allegedly known by the principal [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] of England, Father [[Henry Garnet]]. Although he was convicted of [[treason]] and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through [[Confession (religion)#Roman Catholicism|confession]], Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the [[Seal of the Confessional in the Catholic Church|absolute confidentiality of the confessional]]. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]] of today.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Religion in England===\n{{Main|English Reformation}}\n{{See also|Roman Catholicism in England and Wales}}\n[[File:Elizabeth I George Gower.jpg|thumb|alt=A three-quarter portrait of a middle-aged woman wearing a tiara, bodice, puffed-out sleeves, and a lace ruff.  The outfit is heavily decorated with patterns and jewels.  Her face is pale, her hair light brown.  The backdrop is mostly black.|[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&nbsp;I]]]]\n\nBetween 1533 and 1540, the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] took control of the English Church from Rome, the start of several decades of religious tension in England.  English Catholics struggled in a society dominated by the newly separate and increasingly [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Church of England]].  Henry's daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], responded to the growing religious divide by introducing the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], which required anyone appointed to a public or church office to swear allegiance to the monarch as head of the Church and state. The penalties for refusal were severe; fines were imposed for [[recusancy]], and repeat offenders risked imprisonment and execution.  Catholicism became marginalised, but despite the threat of torture or execution, priests continued to practise their faith in secret.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=12}}</ref>\n\n===Succession===\nQueen Elizabeth, unmarried and childless, steadfastly refused to name an heir. Many Catholics believed that her Catholic cousin, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was the legitimate heir to the English throne, but she was executed for treason in 1587.  The [[Secretary of State (England)|English Secretary of State]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], negotiated secretly with Mary's son, [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]], who had a strong claim to the English throne as Elizabeth's first cousin twice removed through both his parents.{{efn|James VI of Scotland was a great-great-grandson of Henry VII of England, and thus Elizabeth's first cousin twice removed since Henry VII was Elizabeth's paternal grandfather.}} In the months before Elizabeth's death on 24&nbsp;March 1603, Cecil prepared the way for James to succeed her.{{efn|Salisbury wrote to James, \"The subject itself is so perilous to touch amongst us as it setteth a mark upon his head forever that hatcheth such a bird\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Willson|1963|p=154}}</ref>}}\n\nSome exiled Catholics favoured [[Philip II of Spain]]'s daughter, [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Infanta Isabella]], as Elizabeth's successor.  More moderate Catholics looked to James's and Elizabeth's cousin [[Arbella Stuart]], a woman thought to have Catholic sympathies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=15}}</ref>  As Elizabeth's health deteriorated, the government detained those they considered to be the \"principal papists\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=xxv\u2013xxvi}}</ref> and the [[Privy council|Privy Council]] grew so worried that Arbella Stuart was moved closer to [[London]] to prevent her from being kidnapped by [[papist]]s.<ref name=\"Fraserpxxv\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=xxv}}</ref>\n\nDespite competing claims to the English throne, the transition of power following Elizabeth's death went smoothly.{{efn|The [[heir presumptive]] under the terms of [[Henry VIII's will]], i.e. either [[Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp]], or [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven]], depending on whether one recognised the legitimacy of the first-mentioned's birth; and  the Lady [[Arbella Stuart]] on grounds similar to James's own.}}  James's succession was announced by a proclamation from Cecil on 24&nbsp;March, which was generally celebrated.  Leading papists, rather than causing trouble as anticipated, reacted to the news by offering their enthusiastic support for the new monarch.  [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests, whose presence in England was punishable by death, also demonstrated their support for James, who was widely believed to embody \"the natural order of things\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=xxvii\u2013xxix}}</ref>  James ordered a ceasefire in the conflict with Spain, and even though the two countries were still technically at war, [[Philip III of Spain|King Philip III]] sent his envoy, [[Juan de Tassis y Peralta, 2nd Count of Villamediana|Don Juan de Tassis]], to congratulate James on his accession.<ref name=\"Fraserp91\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=91}}</ref><!-- James and Tassis first met 8 November, Fraser p94 -->\n\nFor decades, the English had lived under a monarch who refused to provide an heir, but James arrived with a family and a future line of succession.  His wife, [[Anne of Denmark]], was the daughter of a [[Frederick II of Denmark|king]].  Their eldest child, the nine-year-old [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry]], was considered a handsome and confident boy, and their two younger children, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]] and [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], were proof that James was able to provide heirs to continue the Protestant monarchy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=70\u201374}}</ref>\n\n===Early reign of James I, VI===\n[[File:James I, VI by John de Critz, c.1606.png|thumb|upright|alt=A full length portrait of a middle-aged man, wearing a grey doublet with grey tights, and brown fur draped over his shoulders.|[[James I|King James]], c. 1606<br />(portrait by [[John de Critz]])]]\n\nJames's attitude towards Catholics was more moderate than that of his predecessor, perhaps even tolerant. He promised that he would not \"persecute any that will be quiet and give an outward obedience to the law\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Brice|1994|p=88}}</ref> and believed that exile was a better solution than capital punishment: \"I would be glad to have both their heads and their bodies separated from this whole island and transported beyond seas.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=46}}</ref>  Some Catholics believed that the martyrdom of James's mother, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], would encourage James to convert to the Catholic faith, and the Catholic houses of Europe may also have shared that hope.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=xxx\u2013xxxi}}</ref>  James received an envoy from the Habsburg [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert]] of the Southern Netherlands,<ref name=\"Fraserp91\"/> ruler of the remaining Catholic territories after over 30&nbsp;years of war in the [[Dutch Revolt]] by English-supported Protestant rebels.  For the Catholic expatriates engaged in that struggle, the restoration by force of a Catholic monarchy was an intriguing possibility, but following the failed [[Spanish Armada|Spanish invasion of England]] in 1588 the papacy had taken a longer-term view on the return of a Catholic monarch to the English throne.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=7}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 16th century, Catholics made several assassination attempts on Protestant rulers in Europe and in England, including plans to poison Elizabeth I. The Jesuit [[Juan de Mariana]]'s 1598 ''On Kings and the Education of Kings'' explicitly justified the assassination of the French king [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]\u2014who had been stabbed to death by [[Jacques Cl\u00e9ment|a Catholic fanatic]] in 1589\u2014and until the 1620s, some English Catholics believed that regicide was justifiable to remove tyrants from power.<ref name=MarshallP227>{{Harvnb|Marshall|2006|p=227}}</ref> Much of the \"rather nervous\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=32\u201333}}</ref> James I's political writing was \"concerned with the threat of Catholic assassination and refutation of the [Catholic] argument that 'faith did not need to be kept with heretics'\".<ref name=MarshallP228>{{Harvnb|Marshall|2006|p=228}}</ref>\n\n===Early plots===\nIn the absence of any sign that James would move to end the persecution of Catholics, as some had hoped for, several members of the [[clergy]] (including two anti-Jesuit priests) decided to take matters into their own hands.  In what became known as the [[Bye Plot]], the priests [[William Watson (priest)|William Watson]] and [[William Clark (priest)|William Clark]] planned to kidnap James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics. Cecil received news of the plot from several sources, including the [[Archpriest]] [[George Blackwell]], who instructed his priests to have no part in any such schemes. At about the same time, [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]], [[Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton|Lord Grey de Wilton]], [[Griffin Markham]] and [[Walter Raleigh]] hatched what became known as the [[Main Plot]], which involved removing James and his family and supplanting them with [[Arbella Stuart]].  Amongst others, they approached [[Henry IV of France]] for funding, but were unsuccessful.  All those involved in both plots were arrested in July and tried in autumn 1603; [[George Brooke (conspirator)|Sir George Brooke]] was executed, but James, keen not to have too bloody a start to his reign, reprieved Cobham, Grey, and Markham while they were at the scaffold.

The adjournment of Parliament gave them, they thought, until February 1605 to finalise their plans.  On 9&nbsp;June, Percy's patron, the Earl of Northumberland, appointed him to the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], a [[cavalry|mounted troop]] of 50&nbsp;bodyguards to the King. This role gave Percy reason to seek a base in London, and a small property near the Prince's Chamber owned by Henry Ferrers, a tenant of John Whynniard, was chosen.  Percy arranged for the use of the house through Northumberland's agents, [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Dudley Carleton]] and [[John Hippisley (Parliamentarian)|John Hippisley]].  Fawkes, using the pseudonym \"John Johnson\", took charge of the building, posing as Percy's servant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=52}}</ref>  The building was occupied by Scottish commissioners appointed by the King to consider his plans for the unification of England and Scotland, so the plotters hired Catesby's lodgings in Lambeth, on the opposite bank of the Thames, from where their stored gunpowder and other supplies could be conveniently rowed across each night.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=54\u201355}}</ref>  Meanwhile, King James continued with his policies against the Catholics, and Parliament pushed through anti-Catholic legislation, until its adjournment on 7&nbsp;July.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=122\u2013124}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John rocque house of lords gunpowder plot cropped.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=The medieval House of Lords was part of a complex of buildings alongside the north bank of the River Thames, in London.

Concern over the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] meant that rather than sitting in February, as the plotters had originally planned for, Parliament would not sit again until 3&nbsp;October 1605.  The contemporaneous account of the prosecution claimed that during this delay the conspirators were digging a tunnel beneath Parliament.  This may have been a government fabrication, as no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found.  The account of a tunnel comes directly from Thomas Wintour's confession,<ref name=\"ODNB Thomas Wintour\"/> and Guy Fawkes did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation.  Logistically, digging a tunnel would have proved extremely difficult, especially as none of the conspirators had any experience of mining.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=133\u2013134}}</ref>  If the story is true, by 6&nbsp;December the Scottish commissioners had finished their work, and the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords.  They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above.

The [[Palace of Westminster]] in the early 17th century was a warren of buildings clustered around the medieval chambers, chapels, and halls of the former royal palace that housed both Parliament and the various royal law courts.  The old palace was easily accessible; merchants, lawyers, and others lived and worked in the lodgings, shops and taverns within its precincts.  Whynniard's building was along a right-angle to the House of Lords, alongside a passageway called Parliament Place, which itself led to Parliament Stairs and the [[River Thames]]. Undercrofts were common features at the time, used to house a variety of materials including food and firewood. Whynniard's undercroft, on the ground floor, was directly beneath the first-floor House of Lords, and may once have been part of the palace's medieval kitchen.  Unused and filthy, its location was ideal for what the group planned to do.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=144\u2013145}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Capon map of parliament.jpg|left|thumb|250px|alt=The medieval complex of Parliamentary buildings was mapped by William Capon around the turn of the 18th century.

Garnet answered that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account later admonished Catesby during a second meeting in July in Essex, showing him a letter from the pope which forbade rebellion.  Soon after, the Jesuit priest [[Oswald Tesimond]] told Garnet he had taken Catesby's confession,{{efn|Haynes (2005) writes that Tesimond took Thomas Bates' confession.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=62}}</ref>}} in the course of which he had learnt of the plot.

Fawkes left the country for a short time. The King, meanwhile, spent much of the summer away from the city, hunting.  He stayed wherever was convenient, including on occasion at the houses of prominent Catholics.

More gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=170}}</ref>  The final three conspirators were recruited in late 1605.  At [[Michaelmas]], Catesby persuaded the staunchly Catholic [[Ambrose Rookwood]] to rent [[Clopton House]] near Stratford-upon-Avon.  Rookwood was a young man with recusant connections, whose stable of horses at [[Coldham Hall]] in [[Stanningfield]], [[Suffolk]] was an important factor in his enlistment.  His parents, [[Robert Rookwood]] and [[Dorothea Drury]], were wealthy landowners, and had educated their son at a Jesuit school near [[Calais]].  [[Everard Digby]] was a young man who was generally well liked, and lived at [[Gayhurst House, Buckinghamshire|Gayhurst House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].  He had been knighted by the King in April 1603, and was converted to Catholicism by Gerard.  Digby and his wife, [[Mary Mulshaw]], had accompanied the priest on his pilgrimage, and the two men were reportedly close friends.

In his confession, Tresham claimed that he had asked Catesby if the plot would damn their souls, to which Catesby had replied it would not, and that the plight of England's Catholics required that it be done.  Catesby also apparently asked for \u00a32,000, and the use of [[Rushton Hall]] in [[Northamptonshire]].

From there they continued their journey to Huddington.  Bates left the group and travelled to [[Coughton Court]] to deliver a letter from Catesby, to Father Garnet and the other priests, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army.  Garnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their \"wicked actions\", before himself fleeing.  Several priests set out for Warwick, worried about the fate of their colleagues.  They were caught, and then imprisoned in London.  Catesby and the others arrived at Huddington early in the afternoon, and were met by Thomas Wintour.  They received practically no support or sympathy from those they met, including family members, who were terrified at the prospect of being associated with treason.  They continued on to [[Holbeche House]] on the border of [[Staffordshire]], the home of Stephen Littleton, a member of their ever-decreasing band of followers. Whilst there Stephen Littleton and Thomas Wintour went to 'Pepperhill', the Shropshire residence of [[John Talbot of Grafton|Sir John Talbot]] to gain support but to no avail. Tired and desperate, they spread out some of the now-soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, to dry out.  Although gunpowder does not explode unless physically contained, a spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant, and a man named Morgan (a member of the hunting party).<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=218\u2013222}}</ref>\n\nThomas Wintour and Littleton, on their way from Huddington to Holbeche House, were told by a messenger that Catesby had died.

Digby, Robert Wintour and his half-brother John, and Thomas Bates, had all left.  Of the plotters, only the singed figures of Catesby and Grant, and the Wright brothers, Rookwood, and Percy, remained.

Bates also told his interrogators of his ride with Tesimond to Huddington, before the priest left him to head for the Habingtons at Hindlip Hall, and of a meeting between Garnet, Gerard, and Tesimond in October 1605.  At about the same time in December, Tresham's health began to deteriorate.  He was visited regularly by his wife, a nurse, and his servant William Vavasour, who documented his [[strangury]].  Before he died Tresham had also told of Garnet's involvement with the 1603 mission to Spain, but in his last hours he retracted some of these statements.  Nowhere in his confession did he mention the Monteagle letter.  He died early on the morning of 23&nbsp;December, and was buried in the Tower.  Nevertheless he was attainted along with the other plotters, his head was set on a pike either at Northampton or London Bridge, and his estates confiscated.<!-- Fraser says his estate went to his brother p253 --><ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=249}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Nicholls |first=Mark |chapter=Tresham, Francis (1567?\u20131605) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27708 |accessdate=16 November 2009 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/27708 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105224523/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27708 |archive-date=5 January 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }} {{ODNBsub}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=104}}</ref>\n\nOn 15&nbsp;January a proclamation named Father Garnet, Father Gerard, and Father Greenway (Tesimond) as wanted men.

Monteagle's part in the discovery of the plot was welcomed, and denunciations of the 1603 mission to Spain featured strongly.  Fawkes's protestations that Gerard knew nothing of the plot were omitted from Coke's speech.  The foreign powers, when mentioned, were accorded due respect, but the priests were accursed, their behaviour analysed and criticised wherever possible.  There was little doubt, according to Coke, that the plot had been invented by the Jesuits.

He concluded that a severe backlash against suspected Catholics would have followed, and that without foreign assistance a successful rebellion would have been unlikely; despite differing religious convictions, most Englishmen were loyal to the institution of the monarchy.  England might have become a more \"Puritan absolute monarchy\", as \"existed in Sweden, Denmark, [[Saxony]], and [[Prussia]] in the seventeenth century\", rather than following the path of parliamentary and civil reform that it did.<ref name=\"hutton\">{{citation | last=Hutton | first=Ronald | title=What If the Gunpowder Plot Had Succeeded? | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/gunpowder_hutton_01.shtml | publisher=bbc.co.uk | date=1 April 2001 | accessdate=7 November 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109062537/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/gunpowder_hutton_01.shtml | archive-date=9 January 2009 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Accusations of state conspiracy===\nMany at the time felt that Salisbury had been involved in the plot to gain favour with the King and enact more stridently anti-Catholic legislation.

Measuring devices placed in the chamber to calculate the force of the blast were themselves destroyed by the explosion; the skull of the dummy representing King James, which had been placed on a throne inside the chamber surrounded by courtiers, peers and bishops, was found a considerable distance from the site. According to the findings of the programme, no one within {{convert|330|ft}} of the blast could have survived, and all of the stained glass windows in [[Westminster Abbey]] would have been shattered, as would all of the windows in the vicinity of the Palace. The explosion would have been seen from miles away, and heard from further away still. Even if only half of the gunpowder had gone off, everyone in the House of Lords and its environs would have been killed instantly.<ref name=Times/>\n\nThe programme also disproved claims that some deterioration in the quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up from the top of the barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1501865/Guy-Fawkes-had-twice-the-gunpowder-needed.html | title = Guy Fawkes had twice the gunpowder needed | first = Fiona | last = Govan | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 31 October 2005 | accessdate = 18 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120523012931/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1501865/Guy-Fawkes-had-twice-the-gunpowder-needed.html | archive-date = 23 May 2012 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSome of the gunpowder guarded by Fawkes may have survived.

The process of [[hydrolysis]] involves breaking down the molecular bonds between individual collagen strands and peptides using combinations of physical, chemical or biological means.   Typically, with skin-sourced collagen (Type-I collagens), hides are put in a lime slurry pit for up to 3 months, loosening collagen bonds; the hides are then washed to remove lime, and the collagen extracted in boiling water.  The extracted collagen is evaporator concentrated, desiccated with drum driers, and pulverized.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n== Characteristics ==\nHydrolysis results in the reduction of collagen [[protein]] fibrils of about 300,000 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]] into smaller [[peptides]].

These processes may take several weeks, and differences in such processes have great effects on the properties of the final gelatin products.\n\nGelatin also can be prepared at home. Boiling certain cartilaginous cuts of meat or bones results in gelatin being dissolved into the water. Depending on the concentration, the resulting stock (when cooled) will form a jelly or gel naturally. This process is used for [[aspic]].\n\nWhile many processes exist whereby collagen may be converted to gelatin, they all have several factors in common. The intermolecular and intramolecular bonds that stabilize insoluble collagen must be broken, and also, the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the collagen [[helix]] must be broken.<ref name=\"Ward\"/> The manufacturing processes of gelatin consists of three main stages:\n#Pretreatments to make the raw materials ready for the main extraction step and to remove impurities that may have negative effects on physiochemical properties of the final gelatin product\n#The main extraction step, which usually is done with hot water or dilute acid solutions as a multistage extraction to hydrolyze collagen into gelatin\n#The refining and recovering treatments including filtration, clarification, evaporation, sterilization, drying, rutting, grinding, and sifting to remove the water from the gelatin solution, to blend the gelatin extracted, and to obtain dried, blended, ground final product\n\n===Pretreatments===\nIf the raw material used in the production of the gelatin is derived from [[bone]]s, dilute [[acid]] solutions are used to remove [[calcium]] and other salts. Hot water or several solvents may be used to reduce the fat content, which should not exceed 1% before the main extraction step. If the raw material consists of [[hide (skin)|hides]] and [[skin]]; size reduction, washing, removal of hair from hides, and degreasing are necessary to prepare the hides and skins for the main extraction step.\n\nCollagen hydrolysis is performed by one of three different methods: [[acid hydrolysis|acid]]-, [[base hydrolysis|alkali]]-, and [[enzymatic hydrolysis]]. Acid treatment is especially suitable for less fully [[cross-link]]ed materials such as pig skin collagen and normally requires 10 to 48 hours. Alkali treatment is suitable for more complex collagen such as that found in [[bovine]] hides and requires more time, normally several weeks. The purpose of the alkali treatment is to destroy certain chemical crosslinks still present in collagen. Within the gelatin industry, the gelatin obtained from acid-treated raw material has been called type-A gelatin and the gelatin obtained from alkali-treated raw material is referred to as type-B gelatin.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vyse.com/about_gelatin_process.html|title= Type A & B Process Definition|date= 26 October 2009|accessdate= 16 July 2014|website= |publisher= Vyse Gelatin Company|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150301224019/http://www.vyse.com/about_gelatin_process.html|archivedate= 1 March 2015|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAdvances are occurring to optimize the yield of gelatin using enzymatic hydrolysis of collagen. The treatment time is shorter than that required for alkali treatment, however, and results in almost complete conversion to the pure product. The physical properties of the final gelatin product are considered better.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Recent advances on the role of process variables affecting gelatin yield and characteristics with special reference to enzymatic extraction: A review|journal=Food Hyrocolloids|date=February 2017|volume=63|pages=85\u201396|doi=10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.08.007|last1=Ahmad|first1=Tanbir|last2=Ismail|first2=Amin|last3=Ahmad|first3=Siti Aqlima|last4=Khalil|first4=Khalilah A.|last5=Kumar|first5=Yogesh|last6=Adeyemi|first6=Kazeem D.|last7=Sazili|first7=Awis Q.}}</ref>\n\n===Extraction===\nAfter preparation of the raw material, i.e., reducing cross-links between collagen components and removing some of the impurities such as fat and salts, partially purified collagen is converted into gelatin by extraction with either water or acid solutions at appropriate temperatures. All industrial processes are based on neutral or acid pH values because although alkali treatments speed up conversion, they also promote degradation processes. Acidic extraction conditions are extensively used in the industry, but the degree of acid varies with different processes. This extraction step is a multistage process, and the extraction temperature usually is increased in later extraction steps, which ensures minimum thermal degradation of the extracted gelatin.\n\n===Recovery===\nThis process includes several steps such as filtration, evaporation, drying, grinding, and sifting. These operations are concentration-dependent and also dependent on the particular gelatin used. Gelatin degradation should be avoided and minimized, so the lowest temperature possible is used for the recovery process. Most recoveries are rapid, with all of the processes being done in several stages to avoid extensive deterioration of the peptide structure. A deteriorated peptide structure would result in a low gel strength, which is not generally desired.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Early history of food applications===\n\nThe first use of gelatin in foods is attributed to [[Britain in the Middle Ages|medieval Britain]] (1400s) when cattle hooves were boiled to produce a gel.<ref name=\"enc\">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/gelatin.aspx |title=Gelatin |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917110428/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/gelatin.aspx |archivedate=17 September 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Further commercial development occurred in 1754 when a British manufacturing patent was issued.<ref name=enc/> Food applications in France and the United States during 1800\u20131900 appear to have established the versatility of gelatin, including the origin of its popularity in the USA as [[Jell-O]].<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0756788544|title=Jell-o: A Biography: the History And Mystery of America's Most Famous Dessert|author=Wyman, Carolyn|publisher=Diane Publishing Company|year=2001}}</ref> Over middle-late 1800s, Charles and [[Rose Knox]] of New York manufactured and marketed gelatin powder, diversifying the appeal and applications of gelatin.<ref name=\"enc2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/gelatin.aspx#2 |title=Gelatin: background |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917110428/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/gelatin.aspx#2 |archivedate=17 September 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Culinary uses===\n[[File:Oeufs en gel\u00e9e p1150406.jpg|thumb|[[Egg (food)|Eggs]] in [[aspic]]]]\nProbably best known as a [[gelling agent]] in [[cooking]], different types and grades of gelatin are used in a wide range of food and nonfood products.

For example, [[Jew]]ish [[kosher]] and [[Islamic]] [[halal]] customs require gelatin from sources other than pigs, such as cattle (that have been slaughtered according to the religious regulations) or fish (that they are allowed to consume). [[Roma people]] are cautious of gelatin products that may have been made from horses, as their culture forbids the consumption of horses. Some companies specify the source of the gelatin used.\n\n[[Veganism|Vegans]] and [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] do not eat foods containing gelatin made from animals. Likewise, [[Sikh]], [[Hindu]], and [[Jainism|Jain]] customs may require gelatin alternatives from sources other than animals, as many Hindus, most Jains and some Sikhs are vegetarian. Other people simply consider gelatin unpalatable due to the ingredients used in its production.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nPartial alternatives to gelatins derived from animals include the [[seaweed]] extracts [[agar]] and [[carrageenan]], and the plant extracts [[pectin]] and [[konjac]].

This preparation was called ''jelly''; English cookery writer [[Hannah Glasse]] was the first to record the use of this jelly in [[trifle]] in her book ''[[The Art of Cookery]]'', first published in 1747.<ref name=Glasse>{{cite book |last1=Glasse |first1=Hannah |authorlink1=Hannah Glasse |title=To make hartshorn jelly |work=[[The Art of Cookery]] |page=285 |edition=1774 |url=https://archive.org/stream/artcookerymadep02glasgoog#page/n326/mode/2up/search/trifle}}</ref> Preparations on making jelly (including illustrations) appear in the best selling cookbooks of English writers [[Eliza Acton]] and [[Isabella Beeton]] in the 19th century.\n\n==Preparation==\n\nTo make a gelatin dessert, gelatin is dissolved in hot liquid with the desired flavors and other additives. These latter ingredients usually include [[sugar]], fruit juice, or [[sugar substitute]]s; they may be added and varied during preparation, or pre-mixed with the gelatin in a commercial product which merely requires the addition of hot water.\n\nIn addition to sweeteners, the prepared commercial blends generally contain [[Flavor#Flavorants or flavorings|flavoring agents]] and other additives, such as [[adipic acid]], [[fumaric acid]], [[Trisodium citrate|sodium citrate]], and artificial flavorings and [[food color]]s. Because the [[collagen]] is processed extensively, the final product is not categorized as a meat or [[animal product]] by the US federal government.\n[[File:00505 Weihnachtsgelee Sanok 2012.JPG|thumb|left|A gelatin dessert containing pieces of fruit]]\nPrepared commercial blends may be sold as a powder or as a concentrated gelatinous block, divided into small squares. Either type is mixed with sufficient hot water to completely dissolve it, and then mixed with enough cold water to make the volume of liquid specified on the packet.\n\nThe solubility of powdered gelatin can be enhanced by sprinkling it into the liquid several minutes before heating, \"blooming\" the individual granules.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/gelatintip.htm |title=Unflavored Gelatin - Using Gelatin In Your Cooking |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426091852/http://whatscookingamerica.net/gelatintip.htm |archivedate=26 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The fully dissolved mixture is then [[refrigerate]]d, slowly forming a [[colloid]]al [[gel]] as it cools.\n\nGelatin desserts may be enhanced in many ways, such as using [[Mold (cooking implement)|decorative molds]], creating multicolored layers by adding a new layer of slightly cooled liquid over the previously-solidified one, or suspending non-soluble edible elements such as [[marshmallow]]s or [[fruit]]. Some types of fresh fruit and their unprocessed juices are incompatible with gelatin desserts; see the [[#Chemistry|Chemistry]] section below.\n\nWhen fully chilled, the most common ratios of gelatin to liquid (as instructed on commercial packaging) usually result in a [[custard]]-like texture which can retain detailed shapes when cold but melts back to a viscous liquid when warm. A recipe calling for the addition of additional gelatin to regular jelly gives a rubbery product that can be cut into shapes with cookie cutters and eaten with fingers (called \"Knox Blox\" by the Knox company, makers of unflavored gelatin). Higher gelatin ratios can be used to increase the stability of the gel, culminating in [[Gummy candy|gummy candies]] which remain rubbery solids at room temperature (see [[Bloom (test)]]).\n\nThe Bloom Strength of a gelatin mixture is the measure of how strong it is. It is defined by the force in grams required to press a 12.5&nbsp;mm diameter plunger 4&nbsp;mm into 112 g of a standard 6.67% w/v gelatin gel at 10&nbsp;\u00b0C. The Bloom Strength of a gel is useful to know when determining the possibility of substituting a gelatin of one Bloom Strength for a gelatin of another. One can use the following equation:\n\nC x B<sup>\u00bd</sup> = k\n\nor      C<sub>1</sub>(B<sub>1</sub>)<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u00f7(B<sub>2</sub>)<sup>\u00bd</sup> = C<sub>2</sub>\n\nWhere C = concentration, B = Bloom strength and k = constant. For example, when making gummies, it's important to know that a 250 Bloom gelatin has a much shorter (more thick) texture than a 180 Bloom gelatin.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Food Science and Technology|last=Francis|first=Frederick J|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York|pages=1183\u20131188|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Gelatin shots===\n[[File:Tray of jello shots.jpg|thumb|A tray of [[Shooter (mixed drink)|gelatin shots]] prior to refrigeration]]\n{{see also|Jello shot}}\nA gelatin shot (usually called a '''[[Jell-O]] shot''' in North America and '''vodka jelly''' or '''jelly shot''' in the UK and Australia) is a [[shooter (drink)|shooter]] in which  [[Distilled beverage|liquor]], usually [[vodka]], [[rum]], [[tequila]], or [[neutral grain spirit]], replaces some of the water or fruit juice that is used to congeal the gel.\n\nThe American satirist and mathematician [[Tom Lehrer]] claims to have invented the gelatin shot in the 1950s while working for the [[National Security Agency]], where he developed [[vodka]] gelatin as a way to circumvent a restriction of alcoholic beverages on base.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2000-04-19/news/that-was-the-wit-that-was/ |title=That Was the Wit That Was |work=SF Weekly |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512190125/http://www.sfweekly.com/2000-04-19/news/that-was-the-wit-that-was/ |archivedate=12 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An early published recipe for an alcoholic gelatin drink dates from 1862, found in ''How to Mix Drinks, or The Bon Vivant's Companion'' by [[Jerry Thomas (bartender)|Jerry Thomas]]: his recipe for \"Punch Jelly\" calls for the addition of [[isinglass]] or other [[gelatin]] to a punch made from cognac, rum, and lemon juice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDUEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA24#PPA22,M1|title=How to Mix Drinks, Or, The Bon-vivant's Companion|authorlink=Jerry Thomas (bartender)|first=Jerry|last=Thomas|work=google.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022090430/https://books.google.com/books?id=QDUEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA24#PPA22,M1|archivedate=22 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>''The Joy of Mixology'' by Gary Regan.

The clear gelatin base is prepared using gelatin, water, sugar, citric acid and food flavoring.  \n\nWhen the clear gelatin base sets, colorful shapes are injected using a syringe. \n\nThe injected material usually consists of a sweetener (most commonly sugar), some type of edible liquid (milk, cream, water, etc.), food coloring and a thickening agent such as starch or additional gelatin. \n\nThe shapes are drawn by making incisions in the clear gelatin base using sharp objects. Colored liquid is then allowed to fill the crevice and make the cut shape visible. \n\nMost commonly, the shapes are drawn using sterile medical needles or specialized pre-cut gelatin art tools that allow the shape to be cut and filled with color at the same time. \n\nGelatin art tools are attached to a syringe and used to inject a predetermined shape into gelatin.\n\nWhen combined with other ingredients, such as whipping cream or mousse, gelatin art desserts can be assembled into visually impressive formations resembling a cake. \n\n===Gelatin substitutes===\n{{See also|Agar|Gulaman}}\nOther culinary gelling agents can be used instead of animal-derived gelatin.  These plant-derived substances are more similar to [[pectin]] and other gelling plant [[carbohydrate]]s than to gelatin proteins; their physical properties are slightly different, creating different constraints for the preparation and storage conditions.

Collagen is a protein made up of three strands of polypeptide chains that form in a helical structure. To make a gelatin dessert, such as [[Jell-O|Jello]], the collagen is mixed with water and heated, disrupting the bonds that hold the three strands of polypeptides together. As the gelatin cools, these bonds try to reform in the same structure as before, but now with small bubbles of liquid in between. This gives gelatin its semisolid, gel-like texture.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=What is Jell-O?

This allows it to react with different compounds, such as sugars and other food additives. These interactions give gelatin a versatile nature in the roles that it plays in different foods. It can stabilize foams in foods such as [[marshmallow]]s, it can help maintain small ice crystals in [[ice cream]], and it can even serve as an emulsifier for foods like [[toffee]] and [[margarine]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Food Science and Technology|last=Francis|first=Frederick J|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York|pages=1183\u20131188|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAlthough many gelatin desserts incorporate fruit, some fresh fruits contain proteolytic [[enzyme]]s; these enzymes cut the gelatin molecule into [[peptide]]s (protein fragments) too small to form a firm gel. The use of such fresh fruits in a gelatin recipe results in a dessert that never \"sets\".\n\nSpecifically, [[pineapple]] contains the [[protease]] (protein cutting enzyme) [[bromelain]], [[kiwi fruit]] contains [[actinidin]], [[ficus|fig]]s contain [[ficain]], and [[papaya]] contains [[papain]]. Cooking or [[canning]] [[Denaturation (biochemistry)#Protein denaturation|denatures]] and deactivates the proteases, so canned pineapple, for example, works fine in a gelatin dessert.\n\n== Legal definitions and regulations ==\n=== China ===\nGelatin dessert in China is defined as edible jelly-like food prepared from a mixture of water, sugar and gelling agent.<ref>http://files.instrument.com.cn/FilesCenter/20060626/2006626158325356.pdf</ref> The preparation processes include concocting, gelling, sterilizing and packaging.

At [[Maastricht]], 14 February 1499, Albert settled the succession to his possessions, and endeavoured by this arrangement to prevent further partition of his domain. He died 12 September 1500, and was succeeded in his German territories by George as the head of the Albertine line, while George's brother [[Henry IV, Duke of Saxony|Heinrich]] became hereditary governor of Friesland.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nThe Saxon occupation of Friesland, however, was by no means secure and was the source of constant revolts in that province. Consequently, Heinrich, who was of a rather inert disposition, relinquished his claims to the governorship, and in 1505 an agreement was made between the brothers by which Friesland was transferred to George, while Heinrich received an annuity and the districts of [[Freiberg (district)|Freiberg]] and [[Wolkenstein]]. But this arrangement did not restore peace in Friesland, which remained a source of trouble to Saxony. In 1515 George sold Friesland to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|the future Emperor Charles V]] (then [[Duke of Burgundy]]) for the very moderate price of 100,000 florins. He tried to keep the newmade lands of [[het Bildt]] which weren't granted him by Charles V. These troubles outside of his Saxon possessions did not prevent George from bestowing much care on the government of the ducal territory proper. When regent, during the lifetime of his father, the difficulties arising from conflicting interests and the large demands on his powers had often brought the young prince to the verge of despair.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nIn a short time, however, he developed decided ability as a ruler; on entering upon his inheritance he divided the duchy into governmental districts, took measures to suppress the robber-knights, and regulated the judicial system by defining and readjusting the jurisdiction of the various law courts. In his desire to achieve good order, severity, and the amelioration of the condition of the people, he sometimes ventured to infringe even on the rights of the cities. His court was better regulated than that of any other German prince, and he bestowed a paternal care on the [[University of Leipzig]], where a number of reforms were introduced, and [[Humanism]], as opposed to [[Scholasticism]], was encouraged.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n==Opposition to the Reformation==\nFrom the beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 1517, Duke George directed his energies chiefly to ecclesiastical affairs. Hardly one of the secular German princes held as firmly as he to the Church, he defended its rights and vigorously condemned every innovation except those countenanced by the highest ecclesiastical authorities. At first he was not opposed to Luther, but as time went on and Luther's aim became clear to him, he turned more and more from the Reformer, and was finally, in consequence of this change of attitude, drawn into an acrimonious correspondence in which Luther, according to some without any justification, heavily criticized the duke.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nThe duke was not blind to the undeniable abuses existing at that time in the Church. In 1519, despite the opposition of the theological faculty of the university, he originated the [[Disputation of Leipzig]], with the idea of helping forward the cause of truth, and was present at all the discussions. In 1521, at the [[Diet of Worms]], when the German princes handed in a paper containing a list of \"grievances\" concerning the condition of the Church, George added for himself twelve specific complaints referring mainly to the abuse of [[Indulgences]] and the [[annate]]s.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nIn 1525, he combined with his Lutheran son-in-law, Landgrave [[Philip of Hesse]], and his cousin, the Elector Frederick the Wise, to suppress the [[German Peasants' War|revolt of the peasants]], who were defeated near [[Frankenhausen]] in [[Thuringia]]. Some years later, he wrote a forcible preface to a translation of the [[New Testament]] issued at his command by his private secretary, [[Hieronymus Emser]], as an offset to Luther's version. Lutheran books were confiscated by his order, wherever found, though he refunded the cost of the books. He proved himself in every way a vigorous opponent of the Lutherans, decreeing that Christian burial was to be refused to apostates, and recreant ecclesiastics were to be delivered to the [[bishop of Merseburg]].<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nFor those, however, who merely held anti-catholic opinions, the punishment was only expulsion from the duchy. The duke deeply regretted the constant postponement of the ardently desired council, from the action of which so much was expected. While awaiting its convocation, he thought to remove the more serious defects by a reform of the monasteries, which had become exceedingly worldly in spirit and from which many of the inmates were departing. He vainly sought to obtain from the [[Curia]] the right, which was sometimes granted by [[Rome]], to make official visitations to the conventual institutions of his realm. His reforms were confined mainly to uniting the almost vacant monasteries and to matters of economic management, the control of the property being entrusted in most cases to the secular authorities.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nIn 1525, Duke George formed, with some other German rulers, the [[League of Dessau]], for the protection of Catholic interests. In the same way he was the animating spirit of the [[League of Halle]], formed in 1533, from which sprang in 1538 the [[Holy League of Nuremberg]] for the maintenance of the religious [[Peace of Nuremberg]].<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nThe vigorous activity displayed by the duke in so many directions was not attended with much success. Most of his political measures, indeed, stood the test of experience, but in ecclesiastico-political matters he witnessed with sorrow the gradual decline of Catholicism and the spread of Lutheranism within his dominions, in spite of his earnest efforts and forcible prohibition of the new doctrine. Furthermore, during George's lifetime his nearest relations his son-in-law Philip of Hesse, and his brother Heinrich, joined the Reformers.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nHe spent the last years of his reign in endeavours to secure a Catholic successor, thinking by this step to check the dissemination of Lutheran opinions. The only one of George's sons then living was the weak-minded and unmarried Frederick. The intention of his father was that Frederick should rule with the aid of a council. Early in 1539, Frederick was married to Elizabeth of [[Mansfeld]], but he died shortly afterwards, leaving no prospect of an heir. According to the act of settlement of 1499, George's Protestant brother Heinrich was now heir prospective; but George, disregarding his father's will, sought to disinherit his brother and to bequeath the duchy to [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], brother of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. His sudden death prevented the carrying out of this intention.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n==Character==\nGeorge was an industrious and energetic, if somewhat irascible ruler in the furtherance of the interests of his land and people. A faithful adherent of the Emperor and Empire, he accomplished much for his domain by economy, love of order and wise direction of activities of his state officials. The grief of his life was Luther's Reformation and what he regarded to be apostasy from the Old Faith. Of a strictly religious, although not narrow, disposition, he sought at any cost to keep his subjects from falling away from the Church, but his methods were sometimes questionable.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Gneiss is formed by high-temperature and high-pressure [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] processes acting on formations composed of [[igneous rock|igneous]] or [[sedimentary rock]]s. Orthogneiss is gneiss derived from [[igneous rock]] (such as granite). Paragneiss is gneiss derived from [[sedimentary rock]] (such as sandstone). Gneiss forms at higher temperatures and pressures than does [[schist]]. Gneiss is typically [[Foliation (geology)|foliated]] (composed of layers of sheet-like [[plane (geometry)|planar]] structures). The foliations are characterized by alternating darker and lighter colored bands, called gneissic banding.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''gneiss'' has been used in English since at least 1757. It is [[Loanword|borrowed]] from the German word ''Gneis'', formerly also spelled ''Gneiss'', which is probably derived from the [[Middle High German]] noun {{lang|gmh|gneist}} \"spark\" (so called because the rock glitters).<ref name=etymonline>Harper, ''Online Etym. Dict.'', [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=gneiss&searchmode=none \"gneiss\"]</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nGneissic rocks are usually medium- to coarse-[[Foliation (geology)|foliated]]; they are largely [[Recrystallization (geology)|recrystallized]] but do not carry large quantities of [[mica]]s, [[Chlorite group|chlorite]] or other platy [[mineral]]s. Gneisses that are metamorphosed igneous rocks or their equivalent are termed [[granite]] gneisses, [[diorite]] gneisses, etc. Gneiss rocks may also be named after a characteristic component such as [[garnet]] gneiss, [[biotite]] gneiss, [[albite]] gneiss, etc.  ''Orthogneiss'' designates a gneiss derived from an [[igneous rock]], and ''paragneiss'' is one from a [[sedimentary rock]].\n[[image:Orthogneiss Geopark.jpg|thumb|Orthogneiss from the Czech Republic]]\n''Gneissose'' rocks have properties similar to gneiss.\n\n===Gneissic banding===\nGneiss appears to be striped in bands like parallel lines in shape, called gneissic banding.<ref name=\"Marshak 2009\">{{Harvnb |Marshak |2013 |pp=194\u201395; Figs. 7.6a\u2013c}}</ref> The banding is developed under high temperature and pressure conditions.\n\nThe minerals are arranged into layers that appear as bands in cross section.<ref name=\"Marshak 2009\"/> The appearance of layers, called 'compositional banding', occurs because the layers, or bands, are of different composition. The darker bands have relatively more [[mafic]] minerals (those containing more [[magnesium]] and [[iron]]). The lighter bands contain relatively more [[felsic]] minerals ([[silicate minerals]], containing more of the lighter elements, such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium).\n\nA common cause of the banding is the subjection of the [[protolith]] (the original rock material that undergoes metamorphism) to extreme shearing force, a sliding force similar to the pushing of the top of a deck of cards in one direction, and the bottom of the deck in the other direction.<ref name=\"Marshak 2009\"/> These forces stretch out the rock like a [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]], and the original material is spread out into sheets.\n\nSome banding is formed from original rock material (protolith) that is subjected to extreme temperature and pressure and is composed of alternating layers of [[sandstone]] (lighter) and [[shale]] (darker), which is metamorphosed into bands of [[quartzite]] and [[mica]].<ref name=\"Marshak 2009\"/>\n\nAnother cause of banding is \"metamorphic differentiation\", which separates different materials into different layers through chemical reactions, a process not fully understood.<ref name=\"Marshak 2009\"/>\n\nNot all gneiss rocks have detectable banding. In kyanite gneiss, crystals of [[kyanite]] appear as random clumps in what is mainly a plagioclase ([[albite]]) [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]].\n\n==Types==\n\n===Augen gneiss===\n[[File:Henderson Augen Gneiss.jpg|thumb|Henderson augen gneiss]]\n[[Augen]] gneiss, from the {{lang-de|Augen}} {{IPA-de|\u02c8a\u028a\u0261\u0259n|}}, meaning \"eyes\", is a coarse-grained gneiss resulting from metamorphism of granite, which contains characteristic elliptic or [[Lens (geology)|lenticular]] shear-bound feldspar [[porphyroclast]]s, normally [[microcline]], within the layering of the quartz, biotite and magnetite bands.\n\n===Henderson gneiss===\nHenderson gneiss is found in [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]], US, east of the [[Brevard Shear Zone]].

The second ministry was from 9 May 1986 until 16 October 1989 and this cabinet became known worldwide for its high proportion of female ministers: nearly half, or eight of the total eighteen ministers, were female. The third ministry was from 3 November 1990 to 25 October 1996.\n\nBrundtland became leader of the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] in 1981 and held the office until resigning in 1992, during her third term as Prime Minister. In 1996, she resigned as Prime Minister and retired completely from Norwegian politics. Her successor as both Labour Party leader in 1992 and as Prime Minister in 1996 was [[Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland]].\n\n==International career==\nIn 1983, Brundtland was invited by then [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] to establish and chair the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED), widely referred to as the [[Brundtland Commission]]. She developed the broad political concept of [[sustainable development]] in the course of extensive public hearings, that were distinguished by their inclusiveness. The commission, which published its report, ''[[Our Common Future]]'', in April 1987, provided the momentum for the 1992 [[Earth Summit]]/[[UNCED]], which was headed by [[Maurice Strong]], who had been a prominent member of the commission. The Brundtland Commission also provided momentum for [[Agenda 21]].\n\nDuring her third ministry, the Norwegian government in 1993 took the initiative to sponsor secret peace talks between the Government of Israel led by [[Yitzchak Rabin]] \u2013 like Brundtland, leader of a Labour Party \u2013 and the PLO led by [[Yasser Arafat]]. This culminated with the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]]. For several years afterwards Norway continued to have a high-profile involvement in promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace, though increasingly displaced by the United States from its role as the mediator.\n\nAfter the end of her term as PM, Brundtland was then elected Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]] in May 1998. In this capacity, Brundtland adopted a far-reaching approach to public health, establishing a [[Commission on Macroeconomics and Health]], chaired by [[Jeffrey Sachs]], and addressing [[violence]] as a major public health issue. Brundtland spearheaded the movement, now worldwide, to achieve the abolition of [[Tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]] by education, persuasion, and increased taxation.<ref>{{cite news | author=Claire Doole |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/background_briefings/smoking/198338.stm |title=WHO declares war on tobacco firms |publisher=[[BBC]] news |date=21 October 1998 |accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref> Under her leadership, the World Health Organization was one of the first major employers to make quitting smoking a condition of employment.\nUnder Brundtland's leadership, the World Health Organization was criticized <ref>{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Duff|title=New blood-pressure guidelines pay off \u2014 for drug companies|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-pay-off-8212-for-drug-companies/|accessdate=21 February 2017|work=Seattle Times|issue=26 June 2005|date=26 June 2005|ref=SeattleTimes}}</ref> for increased drug-company influence on the agency.\n\nBrundtland was recognized in 2003 by ''[[Scientific American]]'' as their 'Policy Leader of the Year' for coordinating a rapid worldwide response to stem outbreaks of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]].

On the way to Athens his ship encountered a violent storm, and the terrified Gregory prayed to Christ that if He would deliver him, he would dedicate his life to His service.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |28}}  While at Athens, he developed a close friendship with his fellow student [[Basil of Caesarea]] and also made the acquaintance of Flavius Claudius Julianus, who would later become the emperor known as [[Julian the Apostate]].<ref name = \"Ruether\" />{{rp |19,25}}  In Athens, Gregory studied under the famous rhetoricians [[Himerius]] and [[Proaeresius]].<ref name = \"Hunter-Blair\">{{citation |last=Hunter-Blair |first=DO |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |contribution=Gregory of Nazianzus |publisher=Robert Appleton |year=1910}}</ref> Upon finishing his education, he taught rhetoric in Athens for a short time.\n\n===Priesthood===\nIn 361 Gregory returned to Nazianzus and was ordained a [[presbyter]] by his father, who wanted him to assist with caring for local Christians.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |99\u2013102}}  The younger Gregory, who had been considering a monastic existence, resented his father's decision to force him to choose between priestly services and a solitary existence, calling it an \"act of tyranny\".<ref name = \"Ruether\" />{{rp |32}}<ref>Migne, J.P.

Arriving at Nazianzus, Gregory found the local Christian community split by theological differences and his father accused of heresy by local monks.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |107}}  Gregory helped to heal the division through a combination of personal diplomacy and oratory.\n\nBy this time Emperor Julian had publicly declared himself in opposition to Christianity.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |115}}  In response to the emperor's rejection of the Christian faith, Gregory composed his ''Invectives Against Julian'' between 362 and 363. ''Invectives'' asserts that Christianity will overcome imperfect rulers such as Julian through love and patience. This process as described by Gregory is the public manifestation of the process of deification (''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]''), which leads to a spiritual elevation and mystical union with God.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |121}}  Julian resolved, in late 362, to vigorously prosecute Gregory and his other Christian critics; however, the emperor perished the following year during a campaign against the Persians.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |125\u20136}}  With the death of the emperor, Gregory and the Eastern churches were no longer under the threat of persecution, as the new emperor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] was an avowed Christian and supporter of the church.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |130}}\n\nGregory spent the next few years combating [[Arianism]], which threatened to divide the region of Cappadocia. In this tense environment, Gregory interceded on behalf of his friend Basil with Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea ([[Caesarea Mazaca|Mazaca]]).<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |138\u201342}}  The two friends then entered a period of close fraternal cooperation as they participated in a great rhetorical contest of the Caesarean church precipitated by the arrival of accomplished Arian theologians and rhetors.<ref name=\"McGuckin\" />{{rp |143}}  In the subsequent public debates, presided over by agents of the Emperor [[Valens]], Gregory and Basil emerged triumphant.  This success confirmed for both Gregory and Basil that their futures lay in administration of the Church.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |143}}  Basil, who had long displayed inclinations to the episcopacy, was elected bishop of the see of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea in Cappadocia]] in 370.\n\n===Episcopate in Sasima and Nazianzus===\nGregory was ordained Bishop of [[Sasima]] in 372 by Basil.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |190\u20135}}  Basil created this [[Episcopal see|see]] in order to strengthen his position in his dispute with [[Anthimus of Tyana|Anthimus]], bishop of [[Tyana]].<ref name = \"Hunter-Blair\" /> The ambitions of Gregory's father to have his son rise in the Church hierarchy and the insistence of his friend Basil convinced Gregory to accept this position despite his reservations. Gregory would later refer to his episcopal ordination as forced upon him by his strong-willed father and Basil.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |187\u201392}} Describing his new bishopric, Gregory lamented how it was nothing more than an \"utterly dreadful, pokey little hole; a paltry horse-stop on the main road&nbsp;... devoid of water, vegetation, or the company of gentlemen&nbsp;... this was my Church of Sasima!\"<ref>Gregory, as quoted in ''[[Patrologia Graeca|PG]]'' 37.1059\u201360, ''De Vita Sua'', vv. 439\u201346.</ref>  He made little effort to administer his new diocese, complaining to Basil that he preferred instead to pursue a contemplative life.<ref name = \"Ruether\" />{{rp |38\u20139}}\n\nBy late 372 Gregory returned to Nazianzus to assist his dying father with the administration of his diocese.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |199}}  This strained his relationship with Basil, who insisted that Gregory resume his post at Sasima. Gregory retorted that he had no intention to continue to play the role of pawn to advance Basil's interests.<ref>{{citation |last=Gallay |first=P. |title=Gr\u00e9goire de Nazianze |place=Paris |year=1964 |language=French |page=61}}; quoting from Ep. 48, PG 37.97.</ref> He instead focused his attention on his new duties as [[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutor]] of Nazianzus. It was here that Gregory preached the first of his great episcopal orations.\n\nFollowing the deaths of his mother and father in 374, Gregory continued to administer the Diocese of Nazianzus but refused to be named bishop. Donating most of his inheritance to the needy, he lived an austere existence.<ref name = \"Hunter-Blair\" />  At the end of 375 he withdrew to a monastery at [[Silifke|Seleukia]], living there for three years. Near the end of this period his friend Basil died. Although Gregory's health did not permit him to attend the funeral, he wrote a heartfelt letter of condolence to Basil's brother, [[Gregory of Nyssa]] and composed twelve memorial poems dedicated to the memory of his departed friend.\n\n===Gregory at Constantinople===\nEmperor Valens died in 378. The accession of [[Theodosius I]], a steadfast supporter of Nicene orthodoxy, was good news to those who wished to purge Constantinople of [[Arianism|Arian]] and [[Apollinarism|Apollinarian]] domination.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |235}}  The exiled Nicene party gradually returned to the city. From his deathbed, Basil reminded them of Gregory's capabilities and likely recommended his friend to champion the trinitarian cause in Constantinople.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |235\u20136}}<ref>Orat. 43.2, PG 36.497.</ref>\n\nIn 379, the Antioch synod and its archbishop, Meletios, asked Gregory to go to Constantinople to lead a theological campaign to win over that city to Nicene orthodoxy.<ref name = \"Ruether\" />{{rp |42}}  After much hesitation, Gregory agreed. His cousin Theodosia offered him a villa for his residence; Gregory immediately transformed much of it into a church, naming it Anastasia, \"a scene for the resurrection of the faith\".<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |241}}<ref>2 Kings 4:8 and Orat. 26.17, PG 35.1249.</ref>  From this little chapel he delivered five powerful discourses on Nicene doctrine, explaining the nature of the Trinity and the unity of the Godhead.<ref name = \"Hunter-Blair\" /> Refuting the Eunomion denial of the Holy Spirit's divinity, Gregory offered this argument:\n\n{{quote |Look at these facts: Christ is born, the Holy Spirit is His Forerunner. Christ is baptized, the Spirit bears witness to this&nbsp;... Christ works miracles, the Spirit accompanies them. Christ ascends, the Spirit takes His place. What great things are there in the idea of God which are not in His power? What titles appertaining to God do not apply also to Him, except for Unbegotten and Begotten?

Fearing his popularity, his opponents decided to strike. On the [[Easter Eve|vigil of Easter]] in 379, an Arian mob burst into his church during worship services, wounding Gregory and killing another bishop. Escaping the mob, Gregory next found himself betrayed by his erstwhile friend, the philosopher [[Maximus I of Constantinople|Maximus the Cynic]]. Maximus, who was in secret alliance with Peter, bishop of Alexandria, attempted to seize Gregory's position and have himself ordained bishop of Constantinople.<ref name=\"Ruether\" />{{rp |43}} Shocked, Gregory decided to resign his office, but the faction faithful to him induced him to stay and ejected Maximus. However, the episode left him embarrassed and exposed him to criticism as a provincial simpleton unable to cope with intrigues of the imperial city.<ref name=\"Ruether\" />{{rp |43}}\n\nAffairs in Constantinople remained confused as Gregory's position was still unofficial and Arian priests occupied many important churches. The arrival of the emperor Theodosius in 380 settled matters in Gregory's favor.  The emperor, determined to eliminate Arianism, expelled [[Demophilus of Constantinople|Bishop Demophilus]]. Gregory was subsequently enthroned as bishop of Constantinople at the Basilica of the Apostles, replacing Demophilus.<ref name = \"Ruether\" />{{rp |45}}\n\n===Second Ecumenical Council and retirement to Nazianzus===\n[[Image:3HolyHierarchs.jpg|thumb|left|A Byzantine-style icon depicting the [[Three Holy Hierarchs]]: ''(left to right:)'' [[Basil the Great]], [[John Chrysostom]] and Gregory the Theologian.]]\nTheodosius wanted to further unify the entire empire behind the orthodox position and decided to convene a church council to resolve matters of faith and discipline.<ref name=\"Ruether\" />{{rp |45}}  Gregory was of similar mind in wishing to unify Christianity. In the spring of 381 they convened the [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] in Constantinople, which was attended by 150 Eastern bishops.  After the death of the presiding bishop, [[Meletius of Antioch]], Gregory was selected to lead the Council. Hoping to reconcile the West with the East, he offered to recognize [[Paulinus, Bishop of Antioch|Paulinus]] as Patriarch of Antioch. The Egyptian and Macedonian bishops who had supported Maximus's ordination arrived late for the Council. Once there, they refused to recognise Gregory's position as head of the church of Constantinople, arguing that his transfer from the See of Sasima was canonically illegitimate.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |358\u20139}}\n\nGregory was physically exhausted and worried that he was losing the confidence of the bishops and the emperor.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |359}}  Rather than press his case and risk further division, he decided to resign his office: \"Let me be as the Prophet Jonah!  I was responsible for the storm, but I would sacrifice myself for the salvation of the ship.  Seize me and throw me&nbsp;... I was not happy when I ascended the throne, and gladly would I descend it.\"<ref>''[[Patrologia Graeca|PG]]'', 37.1157\u20139, ''Carm. de vita sua'', ll 1828\u201355.</ref>  He shocked the Council with his surprise resignation and then delivered a dramatic speech to Theodosius asking to be released from his offices. The emperor, moved by his words, applauded, commended his labor and granted his resignation. The Council asked him to appear once more for a farewell ritual and celebratory orations. Gregory used this occasion to deliver a final address (Or. 42) and then departed.<ref name = \"McGuckin\" />{{rp |361}}\n\nReturning to his homeland of Cappadocia, Gregory once again resumed his position as bishop of Nazianzus. He spent the next year combating the local Apollinarian heretics and struggling with periodic illness. He also began composing ''De Vita Sua'', his autobiographical poem.<ref name = \"Ruether\" />{{rp |50}}  By the end of 383 he found his health too feeble to cope with episcopal duties. Gregory established Eulalius as bishop of Nazianzus and then withdrew into the solitude of Arianzum. After enjoying six peaceful years in retirement at his family estate, he died on 25 January in 390.\n\nThroughout his life Gregory faced stark choices. Should he pursue studies as a rhetor or philosopher? Would a monastic life be more appropriate than public ministry? Was it better to blaze his own path or follow the course mapped for him by his father and Basil? Gregory's writings illuminate the conflicts which both tormented and motivated him. Biographers suggest that it was this dialectic which defined him, forged his character and inspired his search for meaning and truth.<ref name = \"Ruether\" />{{rp |54}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Gregory of Nazianzus from Vasilyevskiy chin (15th c., GTG).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrei Rublev]], ''Gregory the Theologian'' (1408), [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]].]]\n\n===Theological and other works===\nGregory's most significant theological contributions arose from his defense of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]].  He is especially noted for his contributions to the field of [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|pneumatology]]\u2014that is, theology concerning the nature of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref>Michael O'Carroll, \"Gregory of Nazianzus\" in ''Trinitas'' (Wilmington, DE: Michael Glazier, 1987).</ref> In this regard, Gregory is the first to use the idea of ''procession'' to describe the relationship between the Spirit and the Godhead: \"The Holy Spirit is truly Spirit, coming forth from the Father indeed but not after the manner of the Son, for it is not by generation but by ''procession'', since I must coin a word for the sake of clearness.\"<ref>Gregory of Nazianzus, ''Five Theological Orations'', oration five. This fifth oration deals entirely with the Holy Spirit.</ref> Although Gregory does not fully develop the concept, the idea of procession would shape most later thought about the Holy Spirit.<ref>HEW Turner and Francis Young, \"Procession(s)\" in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'', ed. A. Richardson & J. Bowden (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1983). Through Augustine, the idea would develop in the West into \"double-procession,\" resulting in the ''[[Filioque clause]]'' and the split between Eastern and Western Christianity.</ref>\n\nHe emphasized that Jesus did not cease to be God when he became a man, nor did he lose any of his divine attributes when he took on human nature. Furthermore, Gregory asserted that Christ was fully human, including a full human soul. He also proclaimed the eternality of the Holy Spirit, saying that the Holy Spirit's actions were somewhat hidden in the [[Old Testament]] but much clearer since the ascension of Jesus into Heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit at the feast of Pentecost.\n\nIn contrast to the Neo-Arian belief that the Son is ''anomoios'', or \"unlike\" the Father, and with the [[Semi-Arian]] assertion that the Son is ''[[homoiousios]]'', or \"like\" the Father, Gregory and his fellow Cappadocians maintained the Nicaean doctrine of ''[[Homoousian|homoousia]]'', or [[consubstantiality]] of the Son with the Father.<ref name = \"B\u00f8rtnes\">{{citation |last=B\u00f8rtnes |year=2006|title=Gregory of Nazianzus: Images and Reflections}}</ref>{{rp |9,10}}  The Cappadocian Fathers asserted that God's nature is unknowable to man; helped to develop the framework of ''[[hypostases]]'', or three persons united in a single Godhead; illustrated how Jesus is the [[icon|eikon]] of the Father; and explained the concept of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'', the belief that all Christians can be assimilated with God in \"imitation of the incarnate Son as the divine model.\"<ref name = \"B\u00f8rtnes\" />{{rp |10}}\n\nSome of Gregory's theological writings suggest that, like his friend [[Gregory of Nyssa]], he may have supported some form of the doctrine of [[apocatastasis]], the belief that God will bring all of creation into harmony with the Kingdom of Heaven.<ref>\"[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc01.html?term=Apocatastasis Apocatastasis]\". ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. I''.</ref> This led some late-nineteenth century [[Universal reconciliation|Christian universalists]], notably [[J. W.

[http://www.tentmaker.org/books/Prevailing.html#211 Chapter XV: Gregory Nazianzen]. Boston and Chicago Universalist Publishing House, 1899.</ref> This view of Gregory is also held by some modern theologians, such as [[John Sachs]] who said that Gregory had \"leanings\" toward apocatastasis, but in a \"cautious, undogmatic\" way.<ref>Sachs, John R. \"Apocatastasis in Patristic Theology.\" Theological Studies. 54 (December 1993), p. 632.</ref>  However, it is not clear or universally accepted that Gregory held to the doctrine of apocatastasis.<ref>David L. Balas, \"Apokatastasis\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', second edition, ed. Everett Ferguson (New York: Garland Publishing, 1997), details [[Gregory of Nyssa]]'s adherence to the doctrine, while making no mention of Nazianzan.</ref>\n\nApart from the several theological discourses, Gregory was also one of the most important early Christian men of letters, a very accomplished orator, perhaps one of the greatest of his time.<ref name = \"B\u00f8rtnes\" />{{rp |21}} Gregory was also a very prolific poet who wrote theological, moral and biographical poems.\n\n===Influence===\nGregory's great nephew Nichobulos served as his literary executor, preserving and editing many of his writings. A cousin, Eulalios, published several of Gregory's more noteworthy works in 391.<ref name=\"McGuckin\" />{{rp |xi}}  By 400, Rufinius began translating his orations into Latin. As Gregory's works circulated throughout the empire they influenced theological thought. His orations were cited as authoritative by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431. By 451 he was designated ''Theologus'', or Theologian by the [[Council of Chalcedon]]<ref name=\"McGuckin\" />{{rp |xi}} \u2014 a title held by no others save [[John the Apostle]]<ref name = \"Hunter-Blair\" /> and [[Symeon the New Theologian]] (949\u20131022 AD). He is widely quoted by Eastern Orthodox theologians and highly regarded as a defender of the Christian faith. His contributions to [[Trinitarian theology]] are also influential and often cited in the Western churches.<ref>See how the 1992 edition of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] cites a variety of Gregory's orations</ref>  [[Paul Tillich]] credits Gregory of Nazianzus for having \"created the definitive formulae for the doctrine of the trinity\".<ref>Tillich, Paul.

His relics, consisting of portions of his body and clothing, were transferred to [[Constantinople]] in 950, into the Church of the Holy Apostles. Part of the relics were taken from Constantinople by [[Crusade]]rs during the [[Fourth Crusade]], in 1204, and ended up in [[Rome]]. On  27 November 2004, those relics, along with those of [[John Chrysostom]], were returned to [[Istanbul]] ([[Constantinople]]) by [[Pope John Paul II]], with the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] retaining a small portion of both. The relics are now enshrined in the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Patriarchal]] [[Church of St. George, Istanbul|Cathedral of St. George]] in the [[Fener|Fanar]].<ref>{{citation|first=Ian |last=Fisher |contribution=Pope returns remains of 2 Orthodox patriarchs |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041128/news_1n28pope.html |title=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=28 November 2004 |accessdate=24 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829143756/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041128/news_1n28pope.html |archivedate=29 August 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nDuring the six years of life which remained to him after his final retirement to his birthplace, Gregory composed the greater part of the copious poetical works which has passed down from generation. These include a valuable autobiographical poem of nearly 2,000 lines; about one hundred other shorter poems relating to his past career; and a large number of epitaphs, epigrams, and epistles to well-known people during that era. The poems that he wrote that dealt with his personal affairs refer to the continuous illness and severe sufferings (physical and spiritual) which assailed him during his last years. In the tiny plot of ground at [[Arianzus]], all that remained to him of his rich inheritance was by a fountain near which there was a shady walk. At this point, Gregory retired to spend his days as a hermit. It was at this point he decided to write theological discourses and poetry of both a religious and an autobiographical nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-gregory-of-nazianzen/|title=Saint Gregory of Nazianzen|date=3 January 2009|publisher=}}</ref> He would sometimes receive occasional visits from intimate friends, as well as sometimes from strangers who were attracted to his retreat by his large reputation for sanctity and learning.
