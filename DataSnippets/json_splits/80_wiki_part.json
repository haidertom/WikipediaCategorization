[[Quarter (United States coin)|U.S. quarter]] (diameter 24&nbsp;mm) for comparison.]]\n\n'''Gunpowder''', also known as '''black powder''' to distinguish it from modern [[smokeless powder]], is the earliest known chemical [[explosive]]. It consists of a mixture of [[sulfur]] (S), [[charcoal]] (C), and [[potassium nitrate]] ([[saltpeter]], KNO<sub>3</sub>). The sulfur and charcoal act as [[fuel]]s while the saltpeter is an [[oxidizer]].{{sfn|Agrawal|2010|p=69}}{{sfn|Cressy|2013}} Because of its incendiary properties and the amount of heat and gas volume that it generates, gunpowder has been widely used as a [[propellant]] in [[firearm]]s, [[artillery]], [[rocket]]s, and [[fireworks]] and as a blasting powder in [[quarry]]ing, [[mining]], and [[road#Construction|road building]].\n\nGunpowder was invented in 9th-century China and spread throughout most parts of Eurasia by the end of the 13th century.{{sfn|Buchanan|2006|p=2}} Originally developed by the [[Taoist|Taoists]] for medicinal purposes, gunpowder was first used for warfare about 1000 AD.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=30}}\n\nGunpowder is classified as a [[Explosive material|low explosive]] because of its relatively slow decomposition rate and consequently low [[brisance]]. Low explosives [[deflagration|deflagrate]] (i.e., burn) at ''subsonic'' speeds, whereas [[high explosives]] [[detonation|detonate]], producing a supersonic wave.\n\nIgnition of gunpowder packed behind a [[projectile]] generates enough pressure to force the shot from the muzzle at high speed, but usually not enough force to rupture the [[gun barrel]]. Gunpowder thus makes a good propellant, but is less suitable for shattering rock or fortifications with its low-yield explosive power. However, by transferring enough energy (from the burning gunpowder to the mass of the cannonball, and then from the cannonball to the opposing fortifications by way of the impacting ammunition) eventually a [[bombardier (rank)|bombardier]] may wear down an opponent's fortified defenses.\n\nGunpowder was widely used to fill fused artillery shells (and used in [[mining]] and [[civil engineering]] projects) until the second half of the 19th century, when the first [[high explosives]] were put into use. Gunpowder is no longer used in modern weapons nor is it used for industrial purposes due to its relatively inefficient cost compared to newer alternatives such as [[dynamite]] and [[ANFO|ammonium nitrate/fuel oil]].<ref name=\"Rossotti2002\">{{cite book|author=Hazel Rossotti|title=Fire: Servant, Scourge, and Enigma|year=2002|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-42261-9|pages=132\u2013137}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Explosives \u2013 History|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/2634/Explosives-History.html |publisher=science.jrank.org|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref> Today gunpowder firearms are limited primarily to hunting, target shooting, and bulletless historical reenactments.\n\n== History of gunpowder ==\n[[File:Chinese Gunpowder Formula.JPG|thumb|Earliest known written formula for gunpowder, from the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' of 1044 AD.]]\n[[File:Huolongjing bomb.jpg|thumb|A 'magic fire meteor going against the wind' bomb as depicted in the ''[[Huolongjing]]'' ca. 1350.]]\n[[File:\u3066\u3064\u306f\u3046\uff08\u9707\u5929\u96f7\uff09.JPG|thumb|Stoneware bombs, known in Japanese as ''Tetsuhau'' (iron bomb), or in Chinese as ''Zhentianlei'' ([[thunder crash bomb]]), excavated from the Takashima shipwreck, October 2011, dated to the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] (1274\u20131281 AD).]]\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Heilongjianghandcannon.jpg|thumb|The [[Heilongjiang hand cannon]], dated to 1288, is a [[Yuan Dynasty]] hand cannon.

In the following centuries various gunpowder weapons such as [[bombs]], [[fire lances]], and the [[gun]] appeared in China.{{sfn|Buchanan|2006|p=2}}\n\n[[Saltpeter]] was known to the Chinese by the mid-1st century AD and was primarily produced in the provinces of [[Sichuan]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Shandong]].{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=103}} There is strong evidence of the use of saltpeter and sulfur in various [[medicine|medicinal]] combinations.{{sfn|Buchanan|2006}} A Chinese alchemical text dated 492 noted saltpeter burnt with a purple flame, providing a practical and reliable means of distinguishing it from other inorganic salts, thus enabling alchemists to evaluate and compare purification techniques; the earliest Latin accounts of saltpeter purification are dated after 1200.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=31-32}}\n\nThe first reference to the incendiary properties of such mixtures is the passage of the ''Zhenyuan miaodao yaol\u00fce'', a [[Taoist]] text tentatively dated to the mid-9th century:{{sfn|Chase|2003}} \"Some have heated together sulfur, [[realgar]] and saltpeter with [[honey]]; smoke and flames result, so that their hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house where they were working burned down.\"{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=4}} The Chinese word for \"gunpowder\" is {{zh|c=\u706b\u836f/\u706b\u85e5 |p=hu\u014f y\u00e0o}} {{IPA|/xuo y\u0251\u028a/}}, which literally means \"Fire Medicine\";{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=30}} however this name only came into use some centuries after the mixture's discovery.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=18}} In the following centuries a variety of gunpowder weapons such as rockets, bombs, and land mines appeared before the first metal barrel firearms were invented.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=1}} Explosive weapons such as bombs have been discovered in a shipwreck off the shore of Japan dated from 1281, during the Mongol invasions of Japan.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Delgado|first=James|title=Relics of the Kamikaze|journal=Archaeology|date=February 2003|volume=56|issue=1|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0301/etc/kamikaze.html}}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' (''Complete Essentials from the Military Classics''), written by [[Zeng Gongliang]] between 1040 and 1044, provides encyclopedia references to a variety of mixtures that included petrochemicals\u2014as well as garlic and honey. A slow match for flame throwing mechanisms using the siphon principle and for fireworks and rockets is mentioned. The mixture formulas in this book do not contain enough saltpeter to create an explosive however; being limited to at most 50% saltpeter, they produce an [[Incendiary device|incendiary]].{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=31}} The ''Essentials'' was however written by a [[Song dynasty]] court bureaucrat, and there is little evidence that it had any immediate impact on warfare; there is no mention of gunpowder use in the chronicles of the wars against the [[Tangut people|Tanguts]] in the 11th century, and China was otherwise mostly at peace during this century.\n\nHowever, by 1083 the Song court was producing hundreds of thousands of fire arrows for their garrisons.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} Bombs and the first proto-guns, known as \"fire lances\", became prominent during the 12th century and were used by the Song during the [[Jin-Song Wars]]. Fire lances were first recorded to have been used at the [[Siege of De'an]] in 1132 by Song forces against the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]].{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=33-34}} In the early 13th century the Jin utilized iron-casing bombs.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=42}} Projectiles were added to fire lances, re-usable fire lance barrels were developed, first out of hardened paper, and then metal. By 1257 some fire lances were firing wads of bullets.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=51}}{{sfn|Partington|1960|p=246}} In the late 13th century metal fire lances became 'eruptors', proto-cannons firing co-viative projectiles, and by 1287 at the latest, had become true guns, the [[hand cannon]].{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=293-4}}\n\n<gallery heights=\"180\">\nFile:Manual Fire Arrow.jpg|An arrow strapped with gunpowder ready to be shot from a bow.

The most telling passage reads: \"We have an example of these things (that act on the senses) in [the sound and fire of] that children's toy which is made in many [diverse] parts of the world; i.e., a device no bigger than one's thumb. From the violence of that salt called saltpeter [together with sulfur and willow charcoal, combined into a powder] so horrible a sound is made by the bursting of a thing so small, no more than a bit of parchment [containing it], that we find [the ear assaulted by a noise] exceeding the roar of strong thunder, and a flash brighter than the most brilliant lightning.\"{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=48-50}} In the early 20th century, British artillery officer Henry William Lovett Hime proposed that [[Roger Bacon#Other attributed works|another work tentatively attributed to Bacon]], ''Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae'' contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder. This claim has been disputed by historians of science including [[Lynn Thorndike]], [[John Maxson Stillman]] and [[George Sarton]] and by Bacon's editor [[Robert Steele (medievalist)|Robert Steele]], both in terms of authenticity of the work, and with respect to the decryption method.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=48-50}} In any case, the formula claimed to have been decrypted (7:5:5 saltpeter:charcoal:sulfur) is not useful for firearms use or even firecrackers, burning slowly and producing mostly smoke.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=358}}{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=xxiv}} However, if Bacon's recipe is taken as measurements by volume rather than weight, a far more potent and serviceable explosive powder is created suitable for firing hand-cannons, albeit less consistent due to the inherent inaccuracies of measurements by volume. One example of this composition resulted in 100 parts saltpeter, 27 parts charcoal, and 45 parts sulfur, by weight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/blackpowder/recipe.html |title=The Recipe for Black Powder |last=Bretscher |first=Ulrich  |website= Ulrich Bretscher's Black Powder Page |access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Liber Ignium]]'', or ''Book of Fires'', attributed to Marcus Graecus, is a collection of incendiary recipes, including some gunpowder recipes. Partington dates the gunpowder recipes to approximately 1300.{{sfn|Partington|1960|p=60}} One recipe for \"flying fire\" (''ignis volatilis'') involves saltpeter, sulfur, and [[colophonium]], which, when inserted into a reed or hollow wood, \"flies away suddenly and burns up everything.\" Another recipe, for artificial \"thunder\", specifies a mixture of one pound native sulfur, two pounds linden or willow charcoal, and six pounds of saltpeter. Another specifies a 1:3:9 ratio.{{sfn|Partington|1960|p=48-49, 54}}\n\nSome of the gunpowder recipes of ''De Mirabilibus Mundi'' of [[Albertus Magnus]] are identical to the recipes of the ''Liber Ignium'', and according to Partington, \"may have been taken from that work, rather than conversely.\"{{sfn|Partington|1960|p=82-83}} Partington suggests that some of the book may have been compiled by Albert's students, \"but since it is found in thirteenth century manuscripts, it may well be by Albert.\"{{sfn|Partington|1960|p=82-83}} Albertus Magnus died in 1280.\n\nA major advance in manufacturing began in Europe in the late 14th century when the safety and thoroughness of incorporation was improved by wet grinding; liquid, such as distilled spirits{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=61}} was added during the grinding-together of the ingredients and the moist paste dried afterwards. The principle of wet mixing to prevent the separation of dry ingredients, invented for gunpowder, is used today in the pharmaceutical industry.<ref>Molerus, Otto. \"History of Civilization in the Western Hemisphere from the Point of View of Particulate Technology, Part 2,\" Advanced Powder Technology 7 (1996): 161\u2013166</ref>\n\nIt was also discovered that if the paste was rolled into balls before drying the resulting gunpowder absorbed less water from the air during storage and traveled better. The balls were then crushed in a mortar by the gunner immediately before use, with the old problem of uneven particle size and packing causing unpredictable results. If the right size particles were chosen, however, the result was a great improvement in power.  Forming the damp paste into ''corn''-sized clumps by hand or with the use of a sieve instead of larger balls produced a product after drying that loaded much better, as each tiny piece provided its own surrounding air space that allowed much more rapid combustion than a fine powder.  This \"corned\" gunpowder was from 30% to 300% more powerful. An example is cited where 34 pounds of serpentine was needed to shoot a 47-pound ball, but only 18 pounds of corned powder.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=61}} The optimum size of the grain depended on its use; larger for large cannon, finer for small arms.  Larger cast cannons were easily muzzle-loaded with corned powder using a long-handled ladle. Corned powder also retained the advantage of low moisture absorption, as even tiny grains still had much less surface area to attract water than a floury powder.\n\nDuring this time, European manufacturers also began regularly purifying saltpeter, using wood ashes containing [[potassium carbonate]] to precipitate calcium from their dung liquor, and using ox blood, [[alum]], and slices of [[turnip]] to clarify the solution.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=61}}\n\nDuring the Renaissance, two European schools of [[pyrotechnics|pyrotechnic]] thought emerged, one in Italy and the other at Nuremberg, Germany. The German printer and publisher Christiaan Egenolff adapted an earlier work on pyrotechnics from manuscript to print form, publishing his ''B\u00fcchsenmeysterei'' in 1529 and reprinting it in 1531. Now extremely rare, the book discusses the manufacturing of gunpowder, the operation of artillery and the rules of conduct for the gunsmith.<ref name=Asher>{{cite web|title=Early printing, 15th and 16th century|url=http://www.forumrarebooks.com/application/upload/forum/files/pdf/2014/Early_Printing.pdf|website=Asher Rare Books|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy, [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]], born in 1480, was a member of the guild ''Fraternita di Santa Barbara'' but broke with the tradition of secrecy by setting down everything he knew in a book titled ''[[De la pirotechnia]]'', written in vernacular.

After he discovered that France was not self-sufficient in gunpowder, a Gunpowder Administration was established;  to head it, the lawyer [[Antoine Lavoisier]] was appointed. Although from a bourgeois family, after his degree in law Lavoisier became wealthy from a company set up to collect taxes for the Crown; this allowed him to pursue experimental natural science as a hobby.<ref>In 1777 Lavoisier named ''oxygen'', which had earlier been isolated by [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]]; the realization that saltpeter contained this substance was fundamental to understanding gunpowder.</ref>\n\nWithout access to cheap saltpeter (controlled by the British), for hundreds of years France had relied on saltpetermen with royal warrants, the ''droit de fouille'' or \"right to dig\", to seize nitrous-containing soil and demolish walls of barnyards, without compensation to the owners.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=164}} This caused farmers, the wealthy, or entire villages to bribe the petermen and the associated bureaucracy to leave their buildings alone and the saltpeter uncollected.  Lavoisier instituted a crash program to increase saltpeter production, revised (and later eliminated) the ''droit de fouille'', researched best refining and powder manufacturing methods, instituted management and record-keeping, and established pricing that encouraged private investment in works.  Although saltpeter from new Prussian-style putrefaction works had not been produced yet (the process taking about 18 months), in only a year France had gunpowder to export. A chief beneficiary of this surplus was the [[American Revolution]].  By careful testing and adjusting the proportions and grinding time, powder from mills such as at [[Essonne]] outside Paris became the best in the world by 1788, and inexpensive.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=164}}<ref>{{citation|last=Metzner|first =Paul|year=1998|title=Crescendo of the Virtuoso: Spectacle, Skill, and Self-Promotion in Paris during the Age of Revolution|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>\n\n=== Great Britain and Ireland ===\n\nGunpowder production in Britain appears to have started in the mid 14th century with the aim of supplying the [[Kingdom of England|English Crown]].{{sfn|Cocroft|2000}} Records show that, in England, gunpowder was being made in 1346 at the [[Tower of London]]; a [[powder house]] existed at the Tower in 1461; and in 1515 three King's gunpowder makers worked there.{{sfn|Cocroft|2000}} Gunpowder was also being made or stored at other Royal castles, such as [[Portchester Castle|Portchester]]. By the early 14th century, according to N.J.G. Pounds's study ''The Medieval Castle in England and Wales,'' many [[England|English]] castles had been deserted and others were crumbling. Their military significance faded except on the borders. Gunpowder had made smaller castles useless.<ref>Ross, Charles. ''The Custom of the Castle: From Malory to Macbeth''.

After the end of [[World War I]], the majority of the United Kingdom gunpowder manufacturers merged into a single company, \"Explosives Trades limited\"; and a number of sites were closed down, including those in Ireland. This company became Nobel Industries Limited; and in 1926 became a founding member of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]]. The [[Home Office]] removed gunpowder from its list of ''Permitted Explosives''; and shortly afterwards, on 31 December 1931, the former [[Curtis & Harvey]]'s [[Glynneath]] gunpowder factory at [[Pontneddfechan]], in [[Wales]], closed down, and it was demolished by fire in 1932.<ref name = glynneath>{{Citation | last =Pritchard | first =Tom | last2 =Evans | first2 =Jack | last3 =Johnson | first3 =Sydney | year =1985 | title =The Old Gunpowder Factory at Glynneath | place =Merthyr Tydfil | publisher =Merthyr Tydfil & District Naturalists' Society}}</ref>\n\nThe last remaining gunpowder mill at the [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|Royal Gunpowder Factory, Waltham Abbey]] was damaged by a German [[parachute mine]] in 1941 and it never reopened.{{sfn|Cocroft|2000}} This was followed by the closure of the gunpowder section at the [[Royal Ordnance Factory]], [[ROF Chorley]], the section was closed and demolished at the end of [[World War II]]; and [[Nobel Industries (Scotland)|ICI Nobel]]'s [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] gunpowder factory, which closed in 1954.{{sfn|Cocroft|2000}}<ref name = macdougall>{{cite book|last1=MacDougall|first1=Ian|title='Oh, ye had to be careful' : personal recollections by Roslin gunpowder mill and bomb factory workers|date=2000|publisher=Tuckwell Press in association with the European Ethnological Research Centre and the Scottish Working People's History Trust|location=East Linton, Scotland|isbn=1-86232-126-4}}</ref>\n\nThis left the sole United Kingdom gunpowder factory at ICI Nobel's [[Ardeer, Scotland|Ardeer]] site in [[Scotland]]; it too closed in October 1976.{{sfn|Cocroft|2000}} Since then gunpowder has been imported into the United Kingdom.

A major problem confronting the study of early gunpowder history is ready access to sources close to the events described. Often the first records potentially describing use of gunpowder in warfare were written several centuries after the fact, and may well have been colored by the contemporary experiences of the chronicler.{{sfn|\u00c1goston|2008|p=15}} Translation difficulties have led to errors or loose interpretations bordering on [[artistic licence]]. Ambiguous language can make it difficult to distinguish gunpowder weapons from similar technologies that do not rely on gunpowder. A commonly cited example is a report of the [[Battle of Mohi]] in Eastern Europe that mentions a \"long lance\" sending forth \"evil-smelling vapors and smoke\", which has been variously interpreted by different historians as the \"first-gas attack upon European soil\" using gunpowder, \"the first use of cannon in Europe\", or merely a \"toxic gas\" with no evidence of gunpowder.{{sfnm|Partington|1999|1p=198|Saunders|1971|2p=198}}   It is difficult to accurately translate original Chinese alchemical texts, which tend to explain phenomena through metaphor, into modern scientific language with rigidly defined terminology in English. {{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=22}} Early texts potentially mentioning gunpowder are sometimes marked by a linguistic process where [[semantic change]] occurred.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=xvi\u2013xvii}} For instance, the Arabic word ''naft'' transitioned from denoting [[naphtha]] to denoting gunpowder, and the Chinese word ''p\u00e0o'' changed in meaning from catapult to referring to a cannon.{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=108-109}} This has led to arguments on the exact origins of gunpowder based on etymological foundations. Science and technology historian Bert S. Hall makes the observation that, \"It goes without saying, however, that historians bent on special pleading, or simply with axes of their own to grind, can find rich material in these terminological thickets.\"{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=xvi\u2013xvii}}\n\nAnother major area of contention in modern studies of the history of gunpowder is regarding the transmission of gunpowder. While the literary and archaeological evidence supports a Chinese origin for gunpowder and guns, the manner in which gunpowder technology was transferred from China to the West is still under debate.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=75}} It is unknown why the rapid spread of gunpowder technology across Eurasia took place over several decades whereas other technologies such as paper, the compass, and printing did not reach Europe until centuries after they were invented in China.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=76}}\n\n== Manufacturing technology ==\n{{main|Powder mill}}\n[[File:Hagley Mill Equipment.jpg|thumb|Edge-runner mill in a restored mill, at [[Hagley Museum and Library|The Hagley Museum]]]]\n[[File:Irvinepowderhouse2.JPG|thumb|The old Powder or Pouther magazine dating from 1642, built by order of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].

Gunpowder was extensively used in the [[Naderian Wars]].]]\n\nFor the most powerful black powder, [[meal powder]], a [[wood]] charcoal, is used. The best wood for the purpose is Pacific [[willow]],<ref>{{cite book|author=US Department of Agriculture|title=Department Bulleting No. 316: Willows: Their growth, use, and importance |year=1917|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x20TAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA15-PA31&dq=black+powder+willow|publisher=The Department}}</ref> but others such as [[alder]] or [[buckthorn]] can be used. In Great Britain between the 15th and 19th centuries charcoal from [[alder buckthorn]] was greatly prized for gunpowder manufacture; [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood]] was used by the American [[Confederate States]].{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=200}} The ingredients are reduced in particle size and mixed as intimately as possible. Originally, this was with a mortar-and-pestle or a similarly operating stamping-mill, using copper, bronze or other non-sparking materials, until supplanted by the rotating [[ball mill]] principle with non-sparking [[bronze]] or [[lead]]. Historically, a marble or [[limestone]] edge runner mill, running on a limestone bed, was used in Great Britain; however, by the mid 19th century this had changed to either an iron-shod stone wheel or a [[cast iron]] wheel running on an iron bed.<ref name=\"earl-2\" /> The mix was dampened with [[alcohol]] or water during grinding to prevent accidental ignition. This also helps the extremely soluble saltpeter to mix into the microscopic nooks and crannies of the very high surface-area charcoal.\n\nAround the late 14th century, European powdermakers first began adding liquid during grinding to improve mixing, reduce dust, and with it the risk of explosion.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=60-63}} The powder-makers would then shape the resulting paste of dampened gunpowder, known as mill cake, into corns, or grains, to dry. Not only did corned powder keep better because of its reduced surface area, gunners also found that it was more powerful and easier to load into guns. Before long, powder-makers standardized the process by forcing mill cake through sieves instead of corning powder by hand.\n\nThe improvement was based on reducing the surface area of a higher density composition. At the beginning of the 19th century, makers increased density further by static pressing. They shoveled damp mill cake into a two-foot square box, placed this beneath a screw press and reduced it to {{frac|1|2}} its volume. \"Press cake\" had the hardness of slate. They broke the dried slabs with hammers or rollers, and sorted the granules with sieves into different grades.  In the United States, [[Eleuthere Irenee du Pont]], who had learned the trade from Lavoisier, tumbled the dried grains in rotating barrels to round the edges and increase durability during shipping and handling. (Sharp grains rounded off in transport, producing fine \"meal dust\" that changed the burning properties.)\n\nAnother advance was the manufacture of kiln charcoal by distilling wood in heated iron retorts instead of burning it in earthen pits. Controlling the temperature influenced the power and consistency of the finished gunpowder.  In 1863, in response to high prices for Indian saltpeter, [[DuPont]] chemists developed a process using [[potash]] or mined [[potassium chloride]] to convert plentiful [[Chile]]an sodium nitrate to potassium nitrate.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=199}}\n\nThe following year (1864) the Gatebeck Low Gunpowder Works in Cumbria (Great Britain) started a plant to manufacture potassium nitrate by essentially the same chemical process.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jecock|first1=Marcus|last2=Dunn|first2=Christopher|title=Gatebeck Low Gunpowder Works and the Workers\u2019 Settlements of Endmoor and Gatebeck, Cumbria|journal=Research Department Report Series|date=2009|volume=63-2009|publisher=English Heritage|issn=1749-8775|display-authors=etal}}</ref> This is nowadays called the \u2018Wakefield Process\u2019, after the owners of the company.

Semi-smokeless powders featured bulk volume properties that approximated black powder, but had significantly reduced amounts of smoke and combustion products. Smokeless powder has different burning properties (pressure vs. time) and can generate higher pressures and work per gram. This can rupture older weapons designed for black powder. Smokeless powders ranged in color from brownish tan to yellow to white. Most of the bulk semi-smokeless powders ceased to be manufactured in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissrifles.com/ammo/index.html|title=Swiss Handguns 1882|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.chuckhawks.com/blackpowder_pyrodex.htm Blackpowder to Pyrodex and Beyond] by Randy Wakeman at Chuck Hawks</ref><ref>[http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/nebland/articles/history/shotshells.asp The History and Art of Shotshells] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114215300/http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/nebland/articles/history/shotshells.asp |date=14 November 2007 }} by Jon Farrar, Nebraskaland Magazine</ref>\n\nBlack powder is a granular mixture of\n* a [[nitrate]], typically potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>), which supplies oxygen for the reaction;\n* [[charcoal]], which provides carbon and other fuel for the reaction, simplified as carbon (C);\n* [[sulfur]] (S), which, while also serving as a fuel, lowers the temperature required to ignite the mixture, thereby increasing the rate of [[combustion]].\nPotassium nitrate is the most important ingredient in terms of both bulk and function because the combustion process releases oxygen from the potassium nitrate, promoting the rapid burning of the other ingredients.{{sfn|Buchanan|2006|p=4}} To reduce the likelihood of accidental ignition by [[static electricity]], the granules of modern black powder are typically coated with [[graphite]], which prevents the build-up of electrostatic charge.\n\nCharcoal does not consist of pure carbon; rather, it consists of partially [[Pyrolysis|pyrolyzed]] [[cellulose]], in which the wood is not completely decomposed. [[Carbon]] differs from ordinary [[charcoal]]. Whereas charcoal's autoignition temperature is relatively low, carbon's is much greater. Thus, a black powder composition containing pure carbon would burn similarly to a match head, at best.<ref>[http://www.musketeer.ch/blackpowder/recipe.html Black Powder Recipes], Ulrich Bretscher</ref>\n\nThe current standard composition for the black powders that are manufactured by pyrotechnicians was adopted as long ago as 1780. Proportions by weight are 75% potassium nitrate (known as saltpeter or saltpetre), 15% softwood charcoal, and 10% sulfur.<ref name = earl-2>{{Harvcolnb|Earl|1978|loc=Chapter 2: The Development of Gunpowder}}</ref> These ratios have varied over the centuries and by country, and can be altered somewhat depending on the purpose of the powder. For instance, power grades of black powder, unsuitable for use in firearms but adequate for blasting rock in quarrying operations, are called blasting powder rather than gunpowder with standard proportions of 70% nitrate, 14% charcoal, and 16% sulfur; blasting powder may be made with the cheaper [[sodium nitrate]] substituted for potassium nitrate and proportions may be as low as 40% nitrate, 30% charcoal, and 30% sulfur.<ref>Julian S. Hatcher, ''Hatcher's Notebook'', Military Service Publishing Company, 1947. Chapter XIII Notes on Gunpowder, pp. 300\u2013305.</ref> In 1857, Lammot du Pont solved the main problem of using cheaper sodium nitrate formulations when he patented DuPont \"B\" blasting powder. After manufacturing grains from press-cake in the usual way, his process tumbled the powder with graphite dust for 12 hours. This formed a graphite coating on each grain that reduced its ability to absorb moisture.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=218}}\n\nNeither the use of graphite nor sodium nitrate was new. Glossing gunpowder corns with graphite was already an accepted technique in 1839,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Some Account of Gunpowder|journal=The Saturday Magazine|date=January 1839|volume=422, supplement|pages=33\u201340}}</ref> and sodium nitrate-based blasting powder had been made in Peru for many years using the sodium nitrate mined at Tarapac\u00e1 (now in Chile).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wisniak|first1=J.

Another suggestion is that it was [[William Lobb]], the planthunter, who recognised the possibilities of sodium nitrate during his travels in South America. Lammot du Pont would have known about the use of graphite and probably also knew about the plants in south-west England. In his patent he was careful to state that his claim was for the combination of graphite with sodium nitrate-based powder, rather than for either of the two individual technologies.\n\nFrench war powder in 1879 used the ratio 75% saltpeter, 12.5% charcoal, 12.5% sulfur. English war powder in 1879 used the ratio 75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal, 10% sulfur.<ref>Book title Workshop Receipts Publisher William Clowes and Son limited Author Ernest Spon. Date 1 August 1873.</ref> The British Congreve rockets used 62.4% saltpeter, 23.2% charcoal and 14.4% sulfur, but the British Mark VII gunpowder was changed to 65% saltpeter, 20% charcoal and 15% sulfur.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The explanation for the wide variety in formulation relates to usage. Powder used for rocketry can use a slower burn rate since it accelerates the projectile for a much longer time\u2014whereas powders for weapons such as flintlocks, cap-locks, or matchlocks need a higher burn rate to accelerate the projectile in a much shorter distance. Cannons usually used lower burn rate powders, because most would burst with higher burn rate powders.\n\n== Serpentine ==\nThe original dry-compounded powder used in 15th-century Europe was known as \"Serpentine\", either a reference to Satan{{sfn|Nolan|2006|p=365}} or to a common artillery piece that used it.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=58}} The ingredients were ground\ntogether with a mortar and pestle, perhaps for 24 hours,{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=58}} resulting in a fine flour.  Vibration during transportation could cause the components to separate again, requiring remixing in the field. Also if the quality of the saltpeter was low (for instance if it was contaminated with highly [[hygroscopic]] [[calcium nitrate]]), or if the powder was simply old (due to the mildly hygroscopic nature of potassium nitrate), in humid weather it would need to be re-dried. The dust from \"repairing\" powder in the field was a major hazard.\n\nLoading cannons or [[Bombard (weapon)|bombards]] before the powder-making advances of the Renaissance was a skilled art. Fine powder loaded haphazardly or too tightly would burn incompletely or too slowly. Typically, the breech-loading powder chamber in the rear of the piece was filled only about half full, the serpentine powder neither too compressed nor too loose, a wooden bung pounded in to seal the chamber from the barrel when assembled, and the projectile placed on.  A carefully determined empty space was necessary for the charge to burn effectively. When the cannon was fired through the touchhole, turbulence from the initial surface combustion caused the rest of the powder to be rapidly exposed to the flame.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=58}}\n\nThe advent of much more powerful and easy to use ''corned'' powder changed this procedure, but serpentine was used with older guns into the 17th century.<ref name=\"Guilmartin2003\">{{cite book|author=John Francis Guilmartin|title=Gunpowder & galleys: changing technology & Mediterranean warfare at sea in the 16th century|year=2003|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|isbn=0-85177-951-4 |pages=109\u2013110 and 298\u2013300}}</ref>\n\n== Corning ==\nFor propellants to oxidize and burn rapidly and effectively, the combustible ingredients must be reduced to the smallest possible particle sizes, and be as thoroughly mixed as possible. Once mixed, however, for better results in a gun, makers discovered that the final product should be in the form of individual dense grains that spread the fire quickly from grain to grain, much as [[straw]] or [[twig]]s catch fire more quickly than a pile of [[sawdust]].\n\nBecause the dry powdered ingredients must be mixed and bonded together for extrusion and cutting into grains to maintain the blend, size reduction and mixing is done while the ingredients are damp, usually with water. After 1800, instead of forming grains by hand or with sieves, the damp ''mill-cake'' was pressed in molds to increase its density and extract the liquid, forming ''press-cake''. The pressing took varying amounts of time, depending on conditions such as atmospheric humidity.  The hard, dense product was broken again into tiny pieces, which were separated with sieves to produce a uniform product for each purpose: coarse powders for cannons, finer grained powders for muskets, and the finest for small hand guns and priming.<ref name=\"Guilmartin2003\" /> Inappropriately fine-grained powder often caused cannons to burst before the projectile could move down the barrel, due to the high initial spike in pressure.<ref>T.J. Rodman (1861), ''Reports of experiments on the properties of metals for cannon and the qualities of cannon powder'', p. 270</ref> ''Mammoth'' powder with large grains, made for [[Rodman gun|Rodman's 15-inch cannon]], reduced the pressure to only 20 percent as high as ordinary cannon powder would have produced.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=195}}\n\nIn the mid-19th century, measurements were made determining that the burning rate within a grain of black powder (or a tightly packed mass) is about 6&nbsp;cm/s (0.20 feet/s), while the rate of ignition propagation from grain to grain is around 9&nbsp;m/s (30 feet/s), over two orders of magnitude faster.<ref name=\"Guilmartin2003\" />\n\n== Modern types ==\nModern corning first compresses the fine black powder meal into blocks with a fixed density (1.7&nbsp;g/cm\u00b3).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tenney L.

These grades were sorted on a system of screens with oversize retained on a mesh of 6 wires per inch, A-1 retained on 10 wires per inch, Fg retained on 14, FFg on 24, FFFg on 46, and FFFFg on 60. Fines designated FFFFFg were usually reprocessed to minimize explosive dust hazards.<ref>Sharpe, Philip B. (1953) ''Complete Guide to Handloading'' Funk & Wagnalls p. 137</ref>  In the [[United Kingdom]], the main service gunpowders were classified RFG (rifle grained fine) with diameter of one or two millimeters and RLG (rifle grained large) for grain diameters between two and six millimeters.<ref name=\"brown\" />  Gunpowder grains can alternatively be categorized by mesh size: the BSS [[Mesh (scale)|sieve mesh size]], being the smallest mesh size, which retains no grains.

[[brown powder|Prismatic Brown Powder]] is a large-grained product the [[Rottweil]] Company introduced in 1884 in Germany, which was adopted by the British Royal Navy shortly thereafter. The French navy adopted a fine, 3.1 millimeter, not prismatic grained product called ''Slow Burning Cocoa'' (SBC) or \"cocoa powder\". These brown powders reduced burning rate even further by using as little as 2 percent sulfur and using charcoal made from [[rye]] straw that had not been completely charred, hence the brown color.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=224}}\n\nLesmok powder was a product developed by DuPont in 1911,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cartridgecollectors.org/glossary.htm |title=LESMOK POWDER}}</ref> one of several semi-smokeless products in the industry containing a mixture of black and nitrocellulose powder. It was sold to [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] and others primarily for .22 and .32 small calibers. Its advantage was that it was believed at the time to be less corrosive than smokeless powders then in use.  It was not understood in the U.S. until the 1920s that the actual source of corrosion was the potassium chloride residue from potassium chlorate sensitized primers.  The bulkier black powder fouling better disperses primer residue.  Failure to mitigate primer corrosion by dispersion caused the false impression that nitrocellulose-based powder caused corrosion.<ref>Julian S. Hatcher, ''Hatcher's Notebook'', Stackpole Books, 1962. Chapter XIV, Gun Corrosion and Ammunition Developments, pp. 346\u2013349.</ref>  Lesmok had some of the bulk of black powder for dispersing primer residue, but somewhat less total bulk than straight black powder, thus requiring less frequent bore cleaning.<ref>{{cite web| first=Randy |last=Wakeman |title=Blackpowder to Pyrodex and Beyond |url=http://www.chuckhawks.com/blackpowder_pyrodex.htm}}</ref>  It was last sold by Winchester in 1947.\n\n== Sulfur-free gunpowder ==\n[[File:Burst muzzle loader barrel.jpg|thumb|Burst barrel of a muzzle loader pistol replica, which was loaded with nitrocellulose powder instead of black powder and could not withstand the higher pressures of the modern propellant]]\nThe development of smokeless powders, such as cordite, in the late 19th century created the need for a spark-sensitive [[blasting cap|priming charge]], such as gunpowder. However, the sulfur content of traditional gunpowders caused [[corrosion]] problems with Cordite Mk I and this led to the introduction of a range of sulfur-free gunpowders, of varying grain sizes.{{sfn|Cocroft|2000}} They typically contain 70.5 parts of saltpeter and 29.5 parts of charcoal.{{sfn|Cocroft|2000}} Like black powder, they were produced in different grain sizes. In the United Kingdom, the finest grain was known as ''sulfur-free mealed powder'' (''SMP''). Coarser grains were numbered as sulfur-free gunpowder (SFG n): 'SFG 12', 'SFG 20', 'SFG 40' and 'SFG 90', for example; where the number represents the smallest BSS sieve mesh size, which retained no grains.\n\nSulfur's main role in gunpowder is to decrease the ignition temperature. A sample reaction for sulfur-free gunpowder would be\n\n: 6 KNO<sub>3</sub> + C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O \u2192 3 K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 4 CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 3 N<sub>2</sub>\n\n== Combustion characteristics ==\n=== Chemical reaction ===\nGunpowder does not burn as a single reaction, so the byproducts are not easily predicted. One study{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} showed that it produced (in order of descending quantities) 55.91% solid products: potassium carbonate, [[potassium sulfate]], [[potassium sulfide]], sulfur, potassium nitrate, [[potassium thiocyanate]], carbon, [[ammonium carbonate]] and 42.98% gaseous products: [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[hydrogen]], [[methane]], 1.11% water.\n\nHowever, simplified equations have been cited.\n\nA simple, commonly cited, [[chemical equation]] for the combustion of black powder is\n:2 [[potassium nitrate|KNO<sub>3</sub>]] + [[sulfur|S]] + 3 [[carbon|C]] \u2192 [[potassium sulfide|K<sub>2</sub>S]] + [[nitrogen|N<sub>2</sub>]] + 3 [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]].\n\nA balanced, but still simplified, equation is<ref>[http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/bang.htm#Blac Flash!

However, it is more hygroscopic than powders made from potassium nitrate\u2014popularly known as saltpeter. Because ''corned'' black powder grains made with saltpeter are less affected by moisture in the air, they can be stored unsealed without degradation by humidity. [[Muzzleloader]]s have been known to fire after hanging on a wall for decades in a loaded state, provided they remained dry. By contrast, black powder made with sodium nitrate must be kept sealed to remain stable.\n\nThe [[matchlock]] musket or pistol (an early gun ignition system), as well as the [[flintlock]] would often be unusable in wet weather, due to powder in the pan being exposed and dampened.\n\n=== Energy ===\nGunpowder releases 3 [[Joule#Megajoule|megajoules]] per [[kilogram]] and contains its own oxidant. This is lower than\n[[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (4.7 [[Joule#Megajoule|megajoules]] per kilogram), or [[gasoline]] (47.2 megajoules per kilogram, but gasoline requires an oxidant, so an optimized gasoline and O<sub>2</sub> mixture contains 10.4 megajoules per kilogram).\nBlack powder also has a low [[energy density]] compared to modern \"smokeless\" powders, and thus to achieve high energy loadings, large amounts of black powder are needed with heavy projectiles.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n=== Effects ===\nGunpowder is a [[Explosive material#Low explosives|low explosive]], that is, it does not [[Detonation|detonate]] but rather [[Deflagration|deflagrates]] (burns quickly). This is an advantage in a propeller device, where one does not desire a shock that would shatter the gun and potentially harm the operator, however it is a drawback when some explosion is wanted. In that case, gunpowder (and most importantly, gases produced by its burning) must be confined. Since it contains its own oxidizer and additionally burns faster under pressure, its combustion is capable of bursting containers such as shell, grenade, or improvised \"pipe bomb\" or \"pressure cooker\" casings to form [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].\n\nIn quarrying, high explosives are generally preferred for shattering rock. However, because of its low [[brisance]], black powder causes fewer fractures and results in more usable stone compared to other explosives, making black powder useful for blasting monumental stone such as [[granite]] and [[marble]]. Black powder is well suited for [[blank round]]s, [[signal flare]]s, [[burst charge]]s, and rescue-line launches. Black powder is also used in fireworks for lifting shells, in rockets as fuel, and in certain [[special effect]]s.\n\nAs seen above, combustion converts less than half the mass of black powder to gas, most of it turns into particulate matter. Some of it is ejected, wasting propelling power, fouling the air, and generally being a nuisance (giving away a soldier's position, generating fog that hinders vision, etc.). Some of it ends up as a thick layer of [[soot]] inside the barrel, where it also is a nuisance for subsequent shots, and a cause of jamming an automatic weapon. Moreover, this residue is [[hygroscopic]], and with the addition of moisture absorbed from the air forms a [[corrosive substance]]. The soot contains [[potassium oxide]] or [[sodium oxide]] that turns into [[potassium hydroxide]], or [[sodium hydroxide]], which corrodes [[wrought iron]] or [[steel]] gun barrels.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Black powder arms must therefore be well cleaned after use, both inside and out, to remove the residue.\n\n== Transportation regulations ==\nThe [[United Nations]] Model Regulations on the Transportation of [[Dangerous Goods]] and national transportation authorities, such as [[United States Department of Transportation]], have classified gunpowder (black powder) as a ''Group A: Primary explosive substance'' for shipment because it ignites so easily. Complete manufactured devices containing black powder are usually classified as ''Group D: Secondary detonating substance, or black powder, or article containing secondary detonating substance'', such as firework, class D [[model rocket]] engine, etc., for shipment because they are harder to ignite than loose powder. As explosives, they all fall into the category of Class 1.\n\n== Mining and industrial uses ==\nBesides its use as a propellant in firearms and artillery, black powder's other main use has been as a blasting powder in quarrying, mining, and road construction (including railroad construction). During the 19th century, outside of war emergencies such as the Crimean War or the American Civil War, more black powder was used in these industrial uses than in firearms and artillery. But [[dynamite]] gradually replaced it for those uses. Today industrial explosives for such uses are still a huge market, but most of the market is in newer explosives rather than black powder.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, gunpowder or smokeless powder was used in [[rivet gun]]s, [[Stunning|stun guns]] for animals, cable splicers and other industrial construction tools.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64&dq=Popular+Science+1931+plane#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=Popular Science|publisher=|author1=Corporation|first1=Bonnier|date=April 1932}}</ref> The \"stud gun\" drove nails or screws into solid concrete, a function not possible with hydraulic tools. Today [[powder-actuated tool]]s are still an important part of various industries, but the cartridges usually use smokeless powders. Industrial [[shotgun]]s have been used to eliminate persistent material rings in operating rotary kilns (such as those for cement, lime, phosphate, etc.) and clinker in operating furnaces, and commercial tools make the method more reliable.<ref>{{cite web|title=MasterBlaster System |url=http://www.remington.com/products/ammunition/industrial/masterblaster-system.aspx |publisher=Remington Products |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004180951/http://www.remington.com/products/ammunition/industrial/masterblaster-system.aspx |archivedate=4 October 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Other uses ==\nGunpowder has occasionally been employed for other purposes besides weapons, mining, and construction:\n* After the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] (1809), the surgeon of the Napoleonic Army [[Dominique-Jean Larrey|Larrey]], lacking salt, seasoned a [[horse meat]] [[bouillon (broth)|bouillon]] for the wounded under his care with gunpowder.<ref name=\"Parker\">{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Harold T.|title=Three Napoleonic battles.|date=1983|publisher=Duke Univ.

Modern attempts to recreate his invention were similarly unsuccessful.\n* Near London in 1853, Captain Shrapnel demonstrated a [[mineral processing]] use of black powder in a method for crushing gold-bearing ores by firing them from a cannon into an iron chamber, and \"much satisfaction was expressed by all present\". He hoped it would be useful on the [[Gold rush|goldfields]] of [[California]] and [[Australia]]. Nothing came of the invention, as continuously-operating crushing machines that achieved more reliable [[comminution]] were already coming into use.<ref>''Mining Journal''  22 January 1853, p.  61</ref>\n* Fireworks use gunpowder as lifting and burst charges, although sometimes other more powerful compositions are added to the burst charge to improve performance in small shells or provide a louder report.

Although his career in computing spanned more than two decades, he is mainly remembered in connection with [[IBM]]'s unsuccessful attempt in 1980 to license CP/M for the [[IBM PC]].\n\n== Early life ==\nGary Kildall was born and grew up in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], where his family operated a [[seafaring]] school.

Digital Research licensed CP/M for the [[IMSAI 8080]], a popular clone of the [[Altair 8800]]. As more manufacturers licensed CP/M, it became a [[de facto standard]] and had to support an increasing number of hardware variations. In response, Kildall pioneered the concept of a [[BIOS]], a set of simple programs stored in the computer hardware (ROM or EPROM chip) that enabled CP/M to run on different systems without modification.<ref name=\"swaine\"/>\n\nCP/M's quick success took Kildall by surprise, and he was slow to update it for [[Floppy disk format|high density floppy disks]] and [[hard disk]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} After hardware manufacturers talked about creating a rival operating system, Kildall started a rush project to develop [[CP/M 2]].<ref name=\"eubanksrecollections\">{{cite interview |editor-first=Clive |editor-last=Akass |author-first=Gordon |author-last=Eubanks |author-link=Gordon Eubanks |title=Interview: Gordon Eubanks, Former Student & CEO of Oblix, Inc. |work=Recollections of Gary Kildall |publisher=DigitalResearch.biz |url=http://www.digitalresearch.biz/EUBANKS.HTM |access-date=2006-11-30}}</ref> By 1981, at the peak of its popularity, CP/M ran on 3,000 different computer models and DRI had $5.4 million in yearly revenues.<ref name=\"swaine\"/>\n\n=== IBM dealings ===\n[[IBM]], presided by [[John R.

In principle, the hardware dependent portions of CP/M were concentrated in the BIOS, thus allowing Glenn, or anyone else, to adapt CP/M to the Imsai equipment. Imsai was subsequently licensed to distribute [[CP/M 1.3|CP/M version 1.3]], which eventually evolved into an operating system called [[IMDOS]].

It is the most ambitious literary undertaking of [[medieval]] Denmark and is an essential source for the nation's early history. It is also one of the oldest known written documents about the [[history of Estonia]] and [[History of Latvia|Latvia]].\n\nConsisting of sixteen books written in [[Latin]] on the invitation of [[Archbishop]] [[Absalon]], ''Gesta Danorum'' describes Danish history and to some degree [[Scandinavia]]n history in general, from prehistory to the late 12th century. In addition, ''Gesta Danorum'' offers singular reflections on European affairs in the [[High Middle Ages]] from a unique Scandinavian perspective, supplementing what has been handed down by historians from [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Southern Europe]].\n\n== Books ==\nThe sixteen books, in prose with an occasional excursion into poetry, can be categorized into two parts: Books 1-9, which deal with [[Norse mythology]], and Books 10-16, which deal with medieval history. Book 9 ends with [[Gorm the Old]], the first factual documented [[King of Denmark]]. The last three books (14-16), which describe Danish conquests on the south shore of the Baltic Sea and wars against [[Slavic peoples]] (the [[Northern Crusades]]), are very valuable for the history of West Slavic tribes ([[Polabian Slavs]], [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranians]]) and [[Slavic mythology|Slavic paganism]]. Book 14 contains a unique description of the temple on the island of [[R\u00fcgen]].\n\n=== Chronology ===\nWhen exactly ''Gesta Danorum'' was written is the subject of numerous works; however, it is generally agreed that ''Gesta Danorum'' was not finished before 1208. The last event described in the last book (Book 16) is King [[Canute VI]] of Denmark subduing [[Pomerania]] under Duke [[Bogislaw I]], in 1186. However the preface of the work, dictated to Archbishop [[Anders Sunesen]], mentions the Danish conquest of the areas north of the [[Elbe]] in 1208.\n\nBook 14, comprising nearly one-quarter of the text of the entire work, ends with [[Absalon]]'s appointment to archbishop in 1178. Since this book is so large and ''Absalon'' has greater importance than King [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]], this book may have been written first and comprised a work on its own. It is possible that Saxo then enlarged it with Books 15 and 16, telling the story of King Valdemar I's last years and King Canute VI's first years.\n\nIt is believed that Saxo then wrote Books 11, 12, and 13. [[Svend Aagesen]]'s history of Denmark, ''[[Brevis Historia Regum Dacie]]'' (circa 1186), states that Saxo had decided to write about \"The king-father and his sons,\" which would be King [[Sweyn Estridson]], in Books 11, 12, and 13. He would later add the first ten books. This would also explain the 22 years between the last event described in the last book (Book 16) and the 1208 event described in the preface.\n\n=== Manuscripts ===\nThe original manuscripts of the work are lost, except for four fragments: the [[Angers Fragment]], [[Lassen Fragment]], [[Kall-Rasmussen Fragment]] and [[Plesner Fragment]]. The Angers Fragment is the biggest fragment, and the only one attested to be in [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]\u2019s own handwriting. The other ones are copies from ca. 1275. All four fragments are in the collection of the [[Danish Royal Library]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.\n\nThe text has, however, survived. In 1510\u20131512, [[Christiern Pedersen]], a Danish translator working in Paris, searched Denmark high and low for an existing copy of Saxo\u2019s works, which by that time was nearly all but lost. By that time most knowledge of Saxo\u2019s work came from a summary located in ''[[Chronica Jutensis]]'', from around 1342, called ''[[Compendium Saxonis]]''. It is also in this summary that the name ''Gesta Danorum'' is found. The title Saxo himself used for his work is unknown.\n\nChristiern Pedersen finally found a copy in the collection of Archbishop [[Birger Gunnersen]] of [[Lund]], Sk\u00e5ne (Sk\u00e5ne is now part of [[Sweden]], but at the time was still part of Denmark), which he gladly lent him. With the help of printer [[Jodocus Badius]], ''Gesta Danorum'' was refined and printed.\n\n=== Printing ===\n[[File:Saxo Chr P front version 001.jpg|thumb|right|Front page of [[Christiern Pedersen]]'s Saxo version, [[Paris]] 1514.]]\nThe first printed press publication and the oldest known complete text of Saxo\u2019s works is Christiern Pedersen's Latin edition, printed and published by Jodocus Badius in Paris, France on 15 March 1514 under the title of ''Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae'' (\"History of the Kings and heroes of the Danes\"). The edition features the following [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]: ...''impressit in inclyta Parrhisorum academia Iodocus Badius Ascensius Idibus Martiis. MDXIIII. Supputatione Romana.'' (the [[Ides of March]], 1514).\n\nThe full front page reads (with abbreviations expanded) in Latin:\n<blockquote>''Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae stilo eleganti a Saxone Grammatico natione Zialandico necnon Roskildensis ecclesiae praeposito, abhinc supra trecentos annos conscriptae et nunc primum literaria serie illustratae tersissimeque impressae.''</blockquote>\n\n[[Danish language]]:\n<blockquote>''De danske Kongers og Heltes Historie, skrevet i pyntelig Stil for over 300 Aar siden af Saxo Grammaticus, en Sj\u00e6llandsfar og Provst ved Kirken i Roskilde, og nu for f\u00f8rste Gang oplyst ved et Register og omhyggeligt trykt''.</blockquote>\n\nEnglish language:\n<blockquote>''Histories of the Kings and heroes of the Danes, composed in elegant style by Saxo Grammaticus, a [[Zealand]]er and also provost of the church of [[Roskilde]], over three hundred years ago, and now for the first time illustrated and printed correctly in a learned compilation.''</blockquote>\n\n\n==== Latin versions==== \nThe source of all existing translations and new editions is Christiern Pedersen's Latin ''Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae''.

It is thought that Shakespeare never read ''Gesta Danorum'', and instead had access to an [[Ur-Hamlet|auxiliary version of the tale]] describing the downfall of the Prince of Denmark, whose real name, [[Amleth]], was used in [[anagram]] by Shakespeare for Hamlet.\n\nSaxo\u2019s version, told of in Books 3 and 4, is very similar to that of Shakespeare\u2019s ''Hamlet''. In Saxo's version, two brothers, [[Horwendill|Orvendil]] and [[Feng (Claudius)|Fengi]] are given the rule over [[Jutland]] by King [[Hr\u00e6rekr sl\u00f6ngvanbaugi|R\u00f8rik Slyngebond]] of the Danes.  Soon after, Orvendil marries King R\u00f8rik\u2019s daughter, Geruth (Gertrude in ''Hamlet''). Amleth is their first and only child.\n\nFengi becomes resentful of his brother\u2019s marriage, and also wants sole leadership of Jutland, so therefore murders Orvendil. After a very brief period of mourning, Fengi marries Geruth, and declares himself sole leader of Jutland. Eventually, Amleth avenges his father\u2019s murder and plans the murder of his uncle, making him the new and rightful King of Jutland. However, while Hamlet dies in Shakespeare's version just after his uncle's death, in Saxo's version Amleth survives and begins ruling his kingdom, going on to other adventures.\n\n== References ==\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation| editor-last = Fisher | editor-first =  Peter | editorlink = | editor-first2 = Hilda Ellis | editor-last2 = Davidson | editorlink2= | title =  Saxo Grammaticus The History of the Danes, Book I-IX | volume = I: Text | publisher =  Cambridge: D.

He is best known as the creator of the [[Minnesota Public Radio]] (MPR) show ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' (called ''Garrison Keillor's Radio Show'' in some international syndication), which he hosted from 1974 to 2016. Keillor created the fictional Minnesota town [[Lake Wobegon]], the setting of many of his books, including ''[[Lake Wobegon Days]] ''and ''[[Leaving Home: A Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories]]''. Other creations include [[Guy Noir]], a detective voiced by Keillor who appeared in ''A Prairie Home Companion'' comic skits. Keillor is also the creator of the five-minute daily radio/podcast program ''[[The Writer's Almanac]]'', which pairs one or two poems of his choice with a script about important literary, historical, and scientific events that coincided with that date in history.\n\nIn November 2017, Minnesota Public Radio cut all business ties with Keillor after an allegation of inappropriate behavior with a freelance writer for ''A Prairie Home Companion''. On April 13, 2018, MPR and Keillor announced a settlement that allows archives of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' and ''The Writer's Almanac'' to be publicly available again, and soon thereafter, Keillor began publishing new episodes of ''The Writer's Almanac'' on his website.<ref>http://www.garrisonkeillor.com/radio-categories/twa-2018/</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:GarrisonKeillor.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Keillor in 2010, wearing his signature red shoes]]\n\nKeillor was born in [[Anoka, Minnesota]], the son of Grace Ruth (''n\u00e9e'' Denham) and John Philip Keillor.

He hosted a weekday drive-time broadcast called ''A Prairie Home Entertainment'', on KSJR FM at [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|St. John's University]] in [[Collegeville, Minnesota|Collegeville]]. The show's eclectic music was a major divergence from the station's usual [[classical music|classical]] fare. During this time he submitted fiction to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, where his first story for that publication, \"Local Family Keeps Son Happy,\" appeared in September 1970.<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite news|first=J.

When he returned to the station in October, the show was dubbed ''A Prairie Home Companion''.<ref name=\"Lee\"/>\n\nKeillor has attributed the idea for the live Saturday night radio program to his 1973 assignment to write about the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', but he had already begun showcasing local musicians on the morning show, despite limited studio space.

Keillor voices Noir, the cowboy Lefty, and other recurring characters, and provides lead or backup vocals for some of the show's musical numbers. The show airs from the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]].\n\nAfter the show's intermission, Keillor reads clever and often humorous greetings to friends and family at home submitted by members of the theater audience in exchange for an honorarium. Also in the second half of the show, Keillor delivers a monologue called ''The News from Lake Wobegon'', a fictitious town based in part on Keillor's own hometown of [[Anoka, Minnesota]], and on [[Freeport, Minnesota|Freeport]] and other small towns in [[Stearns County, Minnesota]], where he lived in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book |first = Garrison | last = Keillor | authorlink = Garrison Keillor | title = In Search of Lake Wobegon | publisher = Viking Studio | location = New York| year = 2001 | pages = 12\u201313 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-670-03037-8}}</ref> [[Lake Wobegon]] is a quintessentially Minnesota small town characterized by the narrator as a place \"... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.\"\n\n[[File:2014DworskyKeillor.jpg|thumb|left|Keillor with [[Richard Dworsky]] on the 40th anniversary of ''A Prairie Home Companion'']]\nThe original ''PHC'' ran until 1987, when Keillor ended it to focus on other projects. In 1989, he launched a new live radio program from New York City, ''The American Radio Company of the Air'', which had essentially the same format as ''PHC''. In 1992, he moved ARC back to St. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to ''A Prairie Home Companion''; it has remained a fixture of Saturday night radio broadcasting ever since.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.prairiehome.org/about/history |title=A Prairie Home Companion |publisher=A Prairie Home Companion |access-date=2016-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115070843/https://www.prairiehome.org/about/history |archivedate=November 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn a typical broadcast of ''A Prairie Home Companion'', Keillor's name is not mentioned unless a guest addresses him by name, although some sketches feature Keillor as his alter ego, Carson Wyler. In the closing credits, which Keillor reads, he gives himself no billing or credit except \"written by [[Cerebellum|Sarah Bellum]],\" a joking reference to his own brain.\n\nKeillor regularly takes the radio company on the road to broadcast from popular venues around the United States; the touring production typically features local celebrities and skits incorporating local color. In April 2000, he took the program to Edinburgh, Scotland, producing two performances in the city's Queen's Hall, which were broadcast by BBC Radio. He toured Scotland with the program to celebrate its 25th anniversary. (In the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the program is known as ''Garrison Keillor's Radio Show''.)

Over the years, Mr. Blue's strongest advice has come down on the side of freedom in our personal lives, freedom from crushing obligation and overwork and family expectations and the freedom to walk our own walk and be who we are. And some of the best letters have been addressed to younger readers trapped in jobs like steel suits, advising them to bust loose and go off and have an adventure. Some of the advisees have written back to inform Mr. Blue that the advice was taken and that the adventure changed their lives. This was gratifying.\n\nSo now I am simply taking my own advice. Cut back on obligations: Promote a certain elegant looseness in life. Simple as that. Winter and spring, I almost capsized from work, and in the summer I had a week in [[Saint Marys Hospital (Rochester)|St. Mary's Hospital]] to sit and think, and that's the result. Every dog has his day and I've had mine and given whatever advice was mine to give (and a little more). It was exhilarating to get the chance to be useful, which is always an issue for a writer (What good does fiction do?), and Mr. Blue was a way to be useful. Nothing human is beneath a writer's attention; the basic questions about how to attract a lover and what to do with one once you get one and how to deal with disappointment in marriage are the stuff that fiction is made from, so why not try to speak directly? And so I did.

Near his capital Ancyra (modern Ankara), Pylamenes, the king's heir, rebuilt a temple of the [[Phrygia]]n god [[Men (god)|Men]] to venerate Augustus (the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]]), as a sign of fidelity. It was on the walls of this temple in Galatia that the major source for the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]]'' of Augustus were preserved for modernity. Few of the provinces proved more enthusiastically loyal to Rome.\n\n[[Josephus]] related the Biblical figure [[Gomer (Ezekiel)|Gomer]] to Galatia (or perhaps to Gaul in general): \"For Gomer founded those whom the Greeks now call Galatians, [Galls], but were then called Gomerites.\"<ref>[[Josephus]].

The fate of the Galatian people is a subject of some uncertainty, but they seem ultimately to have been absorbed into the Greek-speaking populations of Anatolia.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Galatian head Thrace detail.jpg|A Galatian's head as depicted on a gold Thracian ''objet d'art'', 3rd century BC.

Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or [[set theory|set]] of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements (thus creating a [[conceptual model]]). As such, they are the essential basis of all valid [[deductive|deductive inferences]]. The process of [[falsifiability|verification]] is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation.\n\nGeneralization is the process of identifying the parts of a whole, as belonging to the whole. The parts, completely unrelated may be brought together as a group, belonging to the whole by establishing a common relation between them.\n\nIt must be stated that, the parts cannot be generalized into a whole until a common relation is established among '''all''' the parts. But this does not mean that the parts are unrelated, only that no common relation has been established yet for  the generalization.\n\nThe concept of generalization has broad application in many connected disciplines, sometimes having a specialized context or meaning. \n\nOf any two related concepts, such as ''A'' and ''B'', ''A'' is a \"generalization\" of ''B'', and ''B'' is a [[special case]] of ''A'', if and only if\n* every instance of concept ''B'' is also an instance of concept ''A''; and\n* there are instances of concept ''A'' which are not instances of concept ''B''.\n\nFor instance, ''[[animal]]'' is a generalization of ''[[bird]]'' because every bird is an animal, and there are animals which are not birds ([[dog]]s, for instance). (See also: [[Specialisation (biology)]]).\n\n==Hypernym and hyponym==\n{{See also|Semantic change}}\nThe connection of ''generalization'' to ''specialization'' (or ''particularization'') is reflected in the contrasting words [[hypernym]] and [[hyponym]]. A hypernym as a [[generic antecedents|generic]] stands for a class or group of equally ranked items&mdash;for example, ''tree'' stands for equally ranked items such as ''peach'' and ''oak'', and ''ship'' stands for equally ranked items such as ''cruiser'' and ''steamer''. In contrast, a hyponym is one of the items included in the generic, such as ''peach'' and ''oak'' which are included in ''tree'', and ''cruiser'' and ''steamer'' which are included in ''ship''. A hypernym is superordinate to a hyponym, and a hyponym is subordinate to a hypernym.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Biological generalization===\n[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization, it extracts the essence of a concept based on its analysis of similarities from many discrete objects. The resulting simplification enables higher-level thinking.]]\nAn [[animal]] is a generalization of a [[mammal]], a [[bird]], a [[fish]], an [[amphibian]] and a [[reptile]].\n\n===Cartographic generalization of geo-spatial data===\n{{Main|Cartographic generalization}}\nGeneralization has a long history in [[cartography]] as an art of creating maps for different scale and purpose. [[Cartographic generalization]] is the process of selecting and representing information of a map in a way that adapts to the scale of the display medium of the map. In this way, every map has, to some extent, been generalized to match the criteria of display. This includes small cartographic scale maps, which cannot convey every detail of the real world. Cartographers must decide and then adjust the content within their maps to create a suitable and useful map that conveys [[geospatial]] information within their representation of the world.\n\nGeneralization is meant to be context-specific. That is to say, correctly generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way.

Puccini got a diploma from the Pacini School of Music in Lucca in 1880, having studied there with his uncle Fortunato, and later with Carlo Angeloni, who had also instructed [[Alfredo Catalani]]. A grant from [[Margherita of Savoy|Queen Margherita]], and assistance from another uncle, Nicholas Cer\u00f9, provided the funds necessary for Puccini to continue his studies at the [[Milan Conservatory]],<ref name=Dry /><ref name=Streatfield /> where he studied composition with [[Stefano Ronchetti-Monteviti]], [[Amilcare Ponchielli]], and [[Antonio Bazzini]]. Puccini studied at the conservatory for three years, sharing a room with [[Pietro Mascagni]]. In 1880, at the age of 21, Puccini composed his ''[[Messa (Puccini)|Mass]]'', which marks the culmination of his family's long association with [[Christian music|church music]] in his native Lucca.{{refn|Although Puccini himself correctly titled the work a ''Messa'', referring to a setting of the Ordinary of the [[Catholic Mass]], today the work is popularly known as his ''Messa di Gloria'', a name that technically refers to a setting of only the first two prayers of the Ordinary, the [[Kyrie]] and the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], while omitting the [[Credo]], the [[Sanctus]], and the [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]].|group=n}}\n\n==Early career and first operas==\nPuccini wrote an orchestral piece called the ''Capriccio sinfonico'' as a thesis composition for the Milan Conservatory. Puccini's teachers Ponchielli and Bazzini were impressed by the work, and it was performed at a student concert at the conservatory on 14 July 1883, conducted by [[Franco Faccio]]. Puccini's work was favorably reviewed in the Milanese publication ''Perseveranza'',<ref name=Dry /> and thus Puccini began to build a reputation as a young composer of promise in Milanese music circles.\n\n===''Le Villi''===\nAfter the premiere of the ''Capriccio sinfonico'', Ponchielli and Puccini discussed the possibility that Puccini's next work might be an opera. Ponchielli invited Puccini to stay at his villa, where Puccini was introduced to another young man named [[Ferdinando Fontana]].<ref name=Dry /> Puccini and Fontana agreed to collaborate on an opera, for which Fontana would provide the [[libretto]]. The work, ''[[Le Villi]]'', was entered into a competition sponsored by the Sozogno music publishing company in 1883 (the same competition in which [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' was the winner in 1889).<ref name=Dry /> Although it did not win, ''Le Villi'' was later staged at the [[Teatro Dal Verme]], premiering on 31 May 1884.<ref name=Dry /> [[Casa Ricordi|G.

A revised version met with success at the [[Teatro del Giglio]] in Puccini's native Lucca on 5 September 1891.<ref name=Girardi /> In 1892, further revisions reduced the length of the opera from four acts to three, in a version that was well received in Ferrara and was performed in Turin and in Spain.<ref name=Girardi /> Puccini made further revisions in 1901 and 1905, but the work never achieved popularity.<ref name=Girardi /> Without the personal support of Ricordi, ''Edgar'' might have cost Puccini his career. Puccini had eloped with his former piano student, the married Elvira Gemignani, and Ricordi's associates were willing to turn a blind eye to his life style as long as he was successful. When ''Edgar'' failed, they suggested to Ricordi that he should drop Puccini, but Ricordi said that he would stay with him and continued his allowance until his next opera.{{sfn|Carner|1959|p=49}}\n\n===''Manon Lescaut''===\nOn commencing his next opera, ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]'', Puccini announced that he would write his own libretto so that \"no fool of a librettist\"{{sfn|Carner|1959}}{{page needed|date=June 2018}} could spoil it. Ricordi persuaded him to accept [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]] as his librettist, but Puccini soon asked Ricordi to remove him from the project. Four other librettists were then involved with the opera, as Puccini constantly changed his mind about the structure of the piece. It was almost by accident that the final two, [[Luigi Illica]] and [[Giuseppe Giacosa]], came together to complete the opera.\n\n''Manon Lescaut'' premiered at the [[Teatro Regio (Turin)|Teatro Regio]] in Turin on 2 February 1893.<ref name=\"Night of Lescaut premiere\">{{cite news|title=Arte e Scienze|newspaper=La Stampa|date=2 February 1893}}</ref> By coincidence, Puccini's first enduringly popular opera appeared within a week of the premiere of Verdi's last opera, ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', which was first performed on 9 February 1893.<ref name=\"Night of Lescaut premiere\" /> In anticipation of the premiere, ''[[La Stampa]]'' wrote that Puccini was a young man concerning whom \"great hopes\" had a real basis (\"{{Lang|it|un giovane che e tra i pochi sul quale le larghe speranze non siano benigne illusioni}}\").<ref name=\"Night of Lescaut premiere\" /> Because of the failure of ''Edgar'', however, a failure of ''Manon Lescaut'' could have jeopardized Puccini's future as a composer.

''La boh\u00e8me'' premiered in [[Turin]] in 1896, conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]].<ref>Budden p. 494</ref> Within a few years, it had been performed throughout many of the leading opera houses of Europe, including Britain, as well as in the United States.<ref name=\"Amadeus\">{{Almanacco|match=La boh\u00e8me}}</ref> It was a popular success, and remains one of the most frequently performed operas ever written.\n\nThe libretto of the opera, freely adapted from Murger's episodic novel, combines comic elements of the impoverished life of the young protagonists with the tragic aspects, such as the death of the young seamstress Mim\u00ed. Puccini's own life as a young man in Milan served as a source of inspiration for elements of the libretto. During his years as a conservatory student and in the years before ''Manon Lescaut'', he experienced poverty similar to that of the bohemians in ''La boh\u00e8me'', including chronic shortage of necessities like food, clothing and money to pay rent. Although Puccini was granted a small monthly stipend by the Congregation of Charity in Rome ({{Lang|it|Congregazione di carit\u00e1}}), he frequently had to pawn his possessions to cover basic expenses.<ref name=Dry /><ref name=\"Nuova Antologia\">{{cite book|title=Nuova Antologia|date=December 1897|publisher=Direzione della Nuova Antologia|author=Eugenio Checchi|editor=Francisco Protonotari|pages=470\u201381|language=Italian}}</ref> Early biographers such as Wakeling Dry and Eugenio Checchi, who were Puccini's contemporaries, drew express parallels between these incidents and particular events in the opera.<ref name=Dry /><ref name=\"Nuova Antologia\" /> Checchi cited a diary kept by Puccini while he was still a student, which recorded an occasion in which, as in Act 4 of the opera, a single herring served as a dinner for four people.<ref name=Dry /><ref name=\"Nuova Antologia\" /> Puccini himself commented: \"I lived that ''Boh\u00e8me'', when there wasn't yet any thought stirring in my brain of seeking the theme of an opera\". (\"{{Lang|it|Quella Boh\u00e8me io l\u2019ho vissuta, quando ancora non mi mulinava nel cervello l\u2019idea di cercarvi l\u2019argomento per un\u2019opera in musica.}}\")<ref name=\"Nuova Antologia\" />\n\nPuccini's composition of ''La boh\u00e8me'' was the subject of a public dispute between Puccini and fellow composer Ruggiero Leoncavallo.  In early 1893, the two composers discovered that they were both engaged in writing operas based on Murger's work.  Leoncavallo had started his work first, and he and his music publisher claimed to have \"priority\" on the subject (although Murger's work was in the public domain).  Puccini responded that he started his own work without having any knowledge of Leoncavallo's project, and wrote: \"Let him compose.  I will compose.  The audience will decide.\"<ref name=Phillips-Matz />  Puccini's opera premiered a year before that of Leoncavallo, and has been a perennial audience favorite, while Leoncavallo's version of the story was quick to fade into obscurity.<ref name=Girardi />\n\n===''Tosca''===\nPuccini's next work after ''La boh\u00e8me'' was ''[[Tosca]]'' (1900), arguably Puccini's first foray into ''[[verismo]]'', the realistic depiction of many facets of real life including violence. Puccini had been considering an opera on this theme since he saw the play ''Tosca'' by [[Victorien Sardou]] in 1889, when he wrote to his publisher, [[Giulio Ricordi]], begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \"I see in this ''Tosca'' the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\"<ref>Phillips-Matz, pp. 106\u201307</ref>\n[[File:Puccini7.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Puccini photographed in 1908]]\n\nThe music of ''Tosca'' employs musical signatures for particular characters and emotions, which have been compared to Wagnerian leitmotivs, and some contemporaries saw Puccini as thereby adopting a new musical style influenced by Wagner. Others viewed the work differently. Rejecting the allegation that ''Tosca'' displayed Wagnerian influences, a critic reporting on the 20 February 1900 Torino premiere wrote: \"I don't think you could find a more Puccinian score than this.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=La prima della Tosca del M.

The car was driven by Puccini's chauffeur and was carrying Puccini, his future wife Elvira, and their son Antonio. It went off the road, fell several metres, and flipped over. Elvira and Antonio were flung from the car and escaped with minor injuries. Puccini's chauffeur, also thrown from the car, suffered a serious fracture of his femur. Puccini was pinned under the vehicle, with a severe fracture of his right leg and with a portion of the car pressing down on his chest.

It was initially greeted with great hostility (probably largely owing to inadequate rehearsals). When Storchio's [[kimono]] accidentally lifted during the performance, some in the audience started shouting: \"The butterfly is pregnant\" and \"There is the little Toscanini\".

The opera had been originally commissioned by Vienna's [[Carltheater]]; however, the outbreak of [[World War I]] prevented the premiere from being given there. Moreover, the firm of Ricordi had declined the score of the opera&nbsp;\u2013 Giulio Ricordi's son Tito was then in charge and he described the opera as \"bad [[Franz Leh\u00e1r|Leh\u00e1r]]\".<ref>Phillips-Matz (2002) p. 245</ref> It was taken up by their rival, Lorenzo Sonzogno, who arranged the first performance in neutral [[Monaco]].<ref>Gavin Plumley, \"Puccini's Bittersweet Operetta\", San Francisco Opera program, Nov/Dec 2007, pp. 30\u201331</ref> The composer continued to work at revising this, the least known of his mature operas, until his death.\n\n''La rondine'' was initially conceived as an operetta, but Puccini eliminated spoken dialogue, rendering the work closer in form to an opera. A modern reviewer described ''La rondine'' as \"a continuous fabric of lilting waltz tunes, catchy pop-styled melodies, and nostalgic love music,\" while characterizing the plot as recycling characters and incidents from works like 'La traviata' and 'Die Fledermaus'.<ref name=PucciniMitSchlag>{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Peter G.|title=Puccini Mit Schlag|journal=New York Magazine|date=3 Sep 1984|volume=17|issue=35}}</ref>\n\n===''Il trittico'': ''Il tabarro'', ''Suor Angelica'', and ''Gianni Schicchi''===\nIn 1918, ''[[Il trittico]]'' premiered in New York.

Of the three, ''Gianni Schicchi'', containing the popular aria ''[[O mio babbino caro]]'', has remained popular.\n\n===''Turandot''===\n''[[Turandot]]'', Puccini's final opera, was left unfinished, and the last two scenes were completed by [[Franco Alfano]] based on the composer's sketches.

Puccini's relationships with his librettists were at times very difficult. His publisher, Casa Ricordi, was frequently required to mediate disputes and impasses between them.<ref name=\"Phillips-Matz\">Phillips-Matz</ref>\n\nPuccini explored many possible subjects that he ultimately rejected only after a significant amount of effort\u2014such as the creation of a libretto\u2014had been put into them.<ref>Phillips-Matz, ''passim''</ref> Among the subjects that Puccini seriously considered, but abandoned, were: ''Cristoforo Sly'', ''Anima Allegra'' (based on the play ''El genio alegre'' by Seraf\u00edn and Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1lvarez Quintero), ''Two Little Wooden Shoes'' (''I due zoccoletti'') (a short story by Maria Louise Ram\u00e9, a.k.a.

Narciso was killed by the husband of a woman that Narciso had an affair with, dying on 26 February 1903, one day after [[#Automobile accident and near death|Puccini's car accident]].<ref name=Girardi /> Only then, in early 1904, were Puccini and Elvira able to marry, and to legitimize Antonio.\n\nThe marriage between Puccini and Elvira was also troubled by infidelity, as Puccini had frequent affairs himself, including with well-known singers such as [[Maria Jeritza]], [[Emmy Destinn]], [[Cesira Ferrani]], and [[Hariclea Darcl\u00e9e]].<ref name=Girardi />\n\nIn 1909, Puccini's wife Elvira publicly accused Doria Manfredi, a maid working for the Puccini family, of having an affair with the composer. After being publicly accused of adultery, Doria Manfredi committed suicide. An autopsy determined, however, that Doria had died a virgin, refuting the allegations made against her. Elvira Puccini was prosecuted for slander, and was sentenced to more than five months in prison, although a payment to the Manfredi family by Puccini spared Elvira from having to serve the sentence.<ref name=AM /> Some music critics and interpreters of Puccini's work have speculated that the psychological effects of this incident on Puccini interfered with his ability to complete compositions later in his career, and also influenced the development of his characters such as Li\u00f9 (from ''[[Turandot]]''), a slave girl who dies tragically by suicide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: San Francisco Opera's Music Director Designate Nicola Luisotti on Covent Garden's ''Turandot'' and his plans for his new company|url=http://www.musicalcriticism.com/interviews/luisotti-0109.shtml|accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Two films by acclaimed and controversial filmmaker Tony Palmer|url=http://blog.naxos.com/2008/06/26/two-films-by-acclaimed-and-controversial-filmmaker-tony-palmer/|publisher=Naxos|accessdate=25 August 2012|date=26 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107084753/http://blog.naxos.com/2008/06/26/two-films-by-acclaimed-and-controversial-filmmaker-tony-palmer/|archivedate=7 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Weaver, p. 375</ref>\n\nAccording to documents found in the possession of a descendant of the Manfredi family, Nadia Manfredi, in 2007, Puccini was actually having an affair with Giulia Manfredi, Doria's cousin.

Puccini biographer [[Mary Jane Phillips-Matz]] wrote: \"Throughout this entire period [of World War I and its immediate aftermath], Puccini's interest in politics was close to zero, as it had been all his life, so far as one can judge. He seemed almost indifferent to everything from mayoral elections in Viareggio to cabinet appointments in Rome.\"<ref name=\"Phillips-Matz\" /> Another biographer speculates that Puccini may have been\u2014if he had a political philosophy\u2014a monarchist.<ref name=Fairtile>{{cite book|last=Fairtile|first=Linda Beard|title=Giacomo Puccini: A Guide to Research|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-8153-2033-7}}</ref>\n\nPuccini's indifference to politics caused him problems during [[World War I]]. Puccini's long-standing and close friendship with Toscanini was interrupted for nearly a decade because of an argument in the summer of 1914 (in the opening months of the war) during which Puccini remarked that Italy could benefit from German organization.<ref name=\"Phillips-Matz\" /> Puccini was also criticized during the war for his work on ''La rondine'' under a 1913 commission contract with an Austrian theater after Italy and Austria-Hungary became opponents in the war in 1914 (although the contract was ultimately cancelled). Puccini did not participate in the public war effort, but privately rendered assistance to individuals and families affected by the war.<ref name=\"Phillips-Matz\" />\n\nIn 1919, Puccini was commissioned to write music to an ode by {{Interlanguage link multi|Fausto Salvatori|it}} honoring Italy's victories in World War I. The work, ''Inno a Roma'' (Hymn to Rome), was to premiere on 21 April 1919, during a celebration of the anniversary of the founding of Rome. The premiere was delayed to 1 June 1919, when it was played at the opening of a gymnastics competition.<ref>Weaver, p. 301</ref> Although not written for the fascists, ''Inno a Roma'' was widely played during Fascist street parades and public ceremonies.<ref>[http://sfopera.com/SanFranciscoOpera/media/Education-Resource-Materials/Tosca/Puccini_Bio.pdf Puccini biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702150356/http://sfopera.com/SanFranciscoOpera/media/Education-Resource-Materials/Tosca/Puccini_Bio.pdf |date=2 July 2011 }} prepared by San Francisco Opera Company</ref>\n\nPuccini had some contact with [[Benito Mussolini]] and the [[National Fascist Party|Italian Fascist Party]] in the year preceding his death. In 1923 the Fascist Party in Viareggio made Puccini an honorary member and sent him a membership card.<ref name=\"Phillips-Matz\" /> However, evidence that Puccini was actually a member of the [[National Fascist Party|Fascist party]] is ambiguous.<ref name=\"Wilson 2007, 192\">Wilson (2007), 192</ref> The Italian Senate has traditionally included a small number of members appointed in recognition of their cultural contributions to the nation. Puccini hoped to attain this honor, which had been granted to Verdi, and undertook to use his connections to bring about the appointment. While honorary senators could vote, there is no indication that Puccini sought the appointment for this purpose. Puccini also wished to establish a national theater in Viareggio, a project which would require government support. Puccini met with Mussolini twice, in November and December 1923, seeking support for the theater project. While the theater project never came to fruition, Puccini was named Senator (''senatore a vita'') a few months before his death.<ref name=\"Phillips-Matz\" />\n\nAt the time Puccini met with Mussolini, Mussolini had been prime minister for approximately a year, but his party had not yet taken full control of the Italian Parliament through the violence and irregularities of the [[Italian general election, 1924|1924 general election]]. Puccini was no longer alive when Mussolini announced the end of representative government, and the beginning of a fascist dictatorship, in his speech before the Chamber of Deputies on 3 January 1925.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pugliese|first=Stanislao G.|title=Fascism, Anti-Fascism, and the Resistance in Italy: 1919 To the Present|year=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0-7425-3122-8|quote=Mussolini's speech before the Chamber of Deputies on 3 January 1925 is universally recognized as the beginning of the full fascist dictatorship.

A diagnosis of [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] led his doctors to recommend a new and experimental [[radiation therapy]] treatment, which was being offered in [[Brussels]]. Puccini and his wife never knew how serious the cancer was, as the news was revealed only to his son.\n\nPuccini died in Brussels on 29 November 1924, aged 65, from complications after the treatment; uncontrolled bleeding led to a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] the day after surgery. News of his death reached Rome during a performance of ''La boh\u00e8me''. The opera was immediately stopped, and the orchestra played [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|''Funeral March'']] for the stunned audience.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/2012/11/29/the-death-of-giacomo-puccini-brussels-29-november-1924/ |title=The Death of Giacomo Puccini |publisher=The British Newspaper Archive |date=29 November 2012 |accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref> He was buried in [[Milan]], in Toscanini's family tomb, but that was always intended as a temporary measure. In 1926 his son arranged for the transfer of his father's remains to a specially created chapel inside the Puccini villa at Torre del Lago.\n\n==Style and critical reception==\nMost broadly, Puccini wrote in the style of the late-Romantic period of classical music (see [[Romantic music]]).<ref name=\"Davis - Late Style\">{{cite book|last1=David|first1=Andrew|title=Il Trittico, Turandot, and Puccini's Late Style|date=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington IN|isbn=978-0-253-35514-0|pages=8 et seq.}}</ref>  Music historians also refer to Puccini as a component of the ''[[giovane scuola]]'' (\"young school\"), a cohort of composers who came onto the Italian operatic scene as Verdi's career came to an end, such as Mascagni, Leoncavallo, and others mentioned below.<ref name=\"Mallach - The Autumn\" />  Puccini is also frequently referred to as a ''[[verismo]]'' composer.<ref name=\"Montgomery\">{{cite book|last=Montgomery|first=Alan|title=Opera Coaching: Professional Techniques And Considerations|year=2006|publisher=Routledge Taylor and Francis Group|location=New York|isbn=9780415976015}}</ref>\n\nPuccini's career extended from the end of the Romantic period into the modern period.  He consciously attempted to 'update' his style to keep pace with new trends, but did not attempt to fully adopt a modern style.  One critic, Anthony Davis has stated: \"Loyalty toward nineteenth-century Italian-opera traditions and, more generally, toward the musical language of his Tuscan heritage is one of the clearest features of Puccini's music.\"<ref name=\"Davis - Late Style\" />  Davis  also identifies, however, a \"stylistic pluralism\" in Puccini's work, including influences from \"the German symphonic tradition, French harmonic and orchestrational traditions, and, to a lesser extent, aspects of Wagnerian chromaticism.\"<ref name=\"Davis - Late Style\" />  In addition, Puccini frequently sought to introduce music or sounds from outside sources into his operas, such as his use of Chinese folk melodies in Turandot.\n\nAll of Puccini's operas have at least one set piece for a lead singer that is separate enough from its surroundings that it can be treated as a distinct aria, and most of his works have several of these.  At the same time, Puccini's work continued the trend away from operas constructed from a series of set pieces, and instead used a more \"through-composed\" or integrated construction.  His works are strongly melodic.  In orchestration, Puccini frequently doubled the vocal line in unison or at octaves in order to emphasize and strengthen the melodic line.<ref name=\"Davis - Late Style\" />\n\n''Verismo'' is a style of Italian opera that began in 1890 with the first performance of Mascagni's ''Cavalleria rusticana'', peaked in the early 1900s, and lingered into the 1920s.<ref>\"Verismo\" in Stanley Sadie (ed.) ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians'', London: Macmillan/New York: Grove, 1980, vol. 19, p. 670, {{ISBN|1-56159-174-2}}</ref> The style is distinguished by realistic \u2013 sometimes sordid or violent \u2013 depictions of everyday life, especially the life of the contemporary lower classes. It by and large rejects the historical or mythical subjects associated with [[Romanticism]]. ''Cavalleria rusticana'', ''Pagliacci'', and ''Andrea Ch\u00e9nier'' are uniformly considered to be ''verismo'' operas.  Puccini's career as a composer is almost entirely coincident in time with the ''verismo'' movement. Only his ''Le Villi'' and ''Edgar'' preceded ''Cavalleria rusticana''.  Some view Puccini as essentially a ''verismo'' composer,<ref name=Montgomery /> while others, although acknowledging that he took part in the movement to some degree, do not view him as a \"pure\" ''verismo'' composer.<ref name=\"Berger 2005\">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=William|title=Puccini Without Excuses: A Refreshing Reassessment of the World's Most Popular Composer|year=2005|publisher=Random House Digital|isbn=1-4000-7778-8|page=7}}</ref> In addition, critics differ as to the degree to which particular operas by Puccini are, or are not, properly described as ''verismo'' operas.

[[Grove Music Online]] described Puccini's strengths as a composer as follows:\n<blockquote>Puccini succeeded in mastering the orchestra as no other Italian had done before him, creating new forms by manipulating structures inherited from the great Italian tradition, loading them with bold harmonic progressions which had little or nothing to do with what was happening then in Italy, though they were in step with the work of French, Austrian and German colleagues.<ref>Ravenni and Girardi, #11 ''Assessment''</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his work on Puccini, [[Julian Budden]] describes Puccini as a gifted and original composer, noting the innovation hidden in the popularity of works such as \"Che gelida manina\". He describes the aria in musical terms (the signature embedded in the harmony for example), and points out that its structure was rather unheard of at the time, having three distinct musical paragraphs that nonetheless form a complete and coherent whole. This gumption in musical experimentation was the essence of Puccini's style, as evidenced in his diverse settings and use of the [[Motif (music)|motif]] to express ideas beyond those in the story and text.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nPuccini has, however, consistently been the target of condescension by some music critics who find his music insufficiently sophisticated or difficult.<ref name=Groos>{{cite book|last1=Groos|first1=Arthur|last2=Parker|first2=Roger|title=Giacomo Puccini, La Boh\u00e8me|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire] |isbn=0521264898|page=127|edition=Reprinted.}}</ref> Some have explicitly condemned his efforts to please his audience, such as this contemporary Italian critic:\n<blockquote>He willingly stops himself at minor genius, stroking the taste of the public ... obstinately shunning too-daring innovation ... A little heroism, but not taken to great heights; a little bit of veristic comedy, but brief; a lot of sentiment and romantic idyll: this is the recipe in which he finds happiness. ({{Lang|it|[E]gli si arresta volentieri alla piccola genialit\u00e0, accarezzando il gusto del pubblico ... rifuggendo ostinato dalle troppo ardite innovazioni. ...

Indeed, for many years he has remained a victim of his own popularity; hence the resistance to his music in academic circles. Be it remembered, however, that Verdi's melodies were once dismissed as barrel-organ fodder. The truth is that music that appeals immediately to a public becomes subject to bad imitation, which can cast a murky shadow over the original. So long as counterfeit Puccinian melody dominated the world of sentimental operetta, many found it difficult to come to terms with the genuine article. Now that the current coin of light music has changed, the composer admired by Schoenberg, Ravel, and Stravinsky can be seen to emerge in his full stature.<ref name=Budden /></blockquote>\n\n==Works==\n{{Main|List of compositions by Giacomo Puccini}}\n{{Listen|type=music\n|filename=Enrico Caruso, Donna non vidi mai (Manon Lescaut (Puccini)).ogg\n|title=\"Donna non vidi mai\"\n|description=From ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]'', act 1.

January 26, 1983.</ref> He mainly concentrated on comedies and literary adaptations. His career flourished at [[RKO]] when [[David O. Selznick]], the studio's Head of Production, assigned Cukor to direct several of RKO's major films, including ''[[What Price Hollywood?]]'' (1932), ''[[A Bill of Divorcement (1932 film)|A Bill of Divorcement]]'' (1932), ''[[Our Betters]]'' (1933), and ''[[Little Women (1933 film)|Little Women]]'' (1933). When Selznick moved to MGM in 1933, Cukor followed and directed ''[[Dinner at Eight (film)|Dinner at Eight]]'' (1933) and ''[[David Copperfield (1935 film)|David Copperfield]]'' (1935) for Selznick and ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1936) and ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936) for [[Irving Thalberg]].\n\nHe was replaced as the director of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), but he went on to direct ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[Adam's Rib]]'' (1949), ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]'' (1950), ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954), ''[[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]'' (1956), and ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964). He continued to work into the 1980s.\n\n==Early life==\nCukor was born on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in  New York City, the younger child and only son of [[Hungarian-Jewish]] immigrants Viktor, an assistant [[district attorney]], and Hel\u00e9n Ilona Gross. His parents selected his middle name in honor of [[Spanish\u2013American War]] hero [[George Dewey]]. The family was not particularly religious (pork was a staple on the dinner table), and when he started attending temple as a boy, Cukor learned [[Hebrew]] phonetically, with no real understanding of the meaning of the words or what they represented. As a result, he was ambivalent about his faith and dismissive of old world traditions from childhood, and as an adult he embraced [[Anglophilia]] to remove himself even further from his roots.<ref>McGilligan, pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nAs a child, Cukor appeared in several amateur plays and took dance lessons, and at the age of seven he performed in a recital with [[David O. Selznick]], who in later years became a mentor and friend.<ref>McGilligan, p. 11.</ref> As a teenager, Cukor frequently was taken to the [[New York Hippodrome]] by his uncle. Infatuated with theatre, he often cut classes at [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] to attend afternoon matinees.<ref>Kipen, David. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/08/29/DD141675.DTL \"Flawed look at career of blacklisted director\"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', August 29, 2001. Accessed September 14, 2009. \"The American 20th century went to high school at DeWitt Clinton High in the Bronx. Multicultural before there was a name for it \u2013 at least a polite one --Clinton nurtured such diverse and influential figures as Bill Graham, James Baldwin, George Cukor, Neil Simon and Abraham Lincoln Polonsky.\"</ref><ref>McGilligan, p. 10.</ref> During his senior year, he worked as a [[supernumerary actor|supernumerary]] with the [[Metropolitan Opera]], earning 50\u00a2 per appearance, and $1 if he was required to perform in [[blackface]].<ref>Levy, Emanuel, ''George Cukor: Master of Elegance''. New York: William Morrow & Company, Inc. 1994. {{ISBN|0-688-11246-3}}, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nFollowing his graduation in 1917, Cukor was expected to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a career in law. He halfheartedly enrolled in the [[City College of New York]], where he entered the Students Army Training Corps in October 1918. His military experience was limited; Germany surrendered in early November, and Cukor's duty ended after only two months. He left school shortly afterwards.<ref>McGilligan, p. 19.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bette davis bad sister.jpg|thumb|Bette Davis, aged 23]]\nCukor obtained a job as an assistant stage manager and bit player with a touring production of ''[[The Better 'Ole]]'', a popular British musical based on [[Old Bill (cartoon character)|Old Bill]], a cartoon character created by [[Bruce Bairnsfather]].<ref>McGilligan, p. 21.</ref> In 1920, he became the stage manager for the Knickerbocker Players, a troupe that shuttled between [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and [[Rochester, New York]], and the following year he was hired as general manager of the newly formed Lyceum Players, an upstate [[summer stock]] company. In 1925 he formed the C.F. and Z. Production Company with Walter Folmer and John Zwicki, which gave him his first opportunity to direct.<ref>Levy, pp. 33\u201334.</ref><ref>McGilligan, pp. 34\u201335.</ref> Following their first season, he made his Broadway directorial debut with ''Antonia'' by Hungarian playwright [[Melchior Lengyel]], then returned to Rochester, where C.F. and Z. evolved into the Cukor-Kondolf Stock Company, a troupe that included [[Louis Calhern]], [[Ilka Chase]], [[Phyllis Povah]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Reginald Owen]], [[Elizabeth Patterson (actress)|Elizabeth Patterson]] and [[Douglass Montgomery]], all of whom worked with Cukor in later years in Hollywood.<ref>McGilligan, pp. 36\u201341.</ref> Lasting only one season with the company was [[Bette Davis]]. Cukor later recalled, \"Her talent was apparent, but she did buck at direction. She had her own ideas, and though she only did bits and ingenue roles, she didn't hesitate to express them.\" For the next several decades, Davis claimed she was fired, and although Cukor never understood why she placed so much importance on an incident he considered so minor, he never worked with her again.<ref>Levy, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n\nFor the next few years, Cukor alternated between Rochester in the summer months and Broadway in the winter. His direction of a 1926 stage adaptation of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[Owen Davis]] brought him to the attention of the New York critics. Writing in the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]'', drama critic Arthur Pollock called it \"an unusual piece of work by a director not nearly so well known as he should be.\"<ref>McGilligan, p. 53.</ref> Cukor directed six more Broadway productions before departing for Hollywood in 1929.\n\n==Early Hollywood career==\n\nWhen Hollywood began to recruit New York theater talent for sound films, Cukor immediately answered the call. In December 1928, [[Paramount Pictures]] signed him to a contract that reimbursed him for his airfare and initially paid him $600 per week with no screen credit during a six-month apprenticeship. He arrived in Hollywood in February 1929, and his first assignment was to coach the cast of ''River of Romance'' to speak with an acceptable Southern accent.<ref>McGilligan, p. 61.</ref> In October, the studio lent him to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] to conduct the screen tests and work as a dialogue director for ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' which was released in 1930. That year he co-directed three films at Paramount, and his weekly salary was increased to $1500.<ref>McGilligan, pp. 67\u201369.</ref> He made his solo directorial debut with ''[[Tarnished Lady]]'' (1931) starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]].\n\nCukor was then assigned to ''[[One Hour with You]]'' (1932), an [[operetta]] with [[Maurice Chevalier]] and [[Jeanette MacDonald]], when original director [[Ernst Lubitsch]] opted to concentrate on producing the film instead. At first the two men worked well together, but two weeks into filming Lubitsch began arriving on the set on a regular basis, and he soon began directing scenes with Cukor's consent. Upon the film's completion, Lubitsch approached Paramount general manager [[B.P. Schulberg]] and threatened to leave the studio if Cukor's name wasn't removed from the credits. When Schulberg asked him to cooperate, Cukor filed suit. He eventually settled for being billed as assistant director and then left Paramount to work with David O. Selznick at [[RKO Studios]].<ref>McGilligan, pp. 69\u201371.</ref>\n[[File:PhiladelphiaStory trailer.png|thumb|333p|right|Scene from Cukor's hit film ''The Philadelphia Story'']]\nCukor quickly earned a reputation as a director who could coax great performances from actresses and he became known as a \"woman's director\", a title he resented. Despite this reputation, during his career, he oversaw more performances honored with the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] than any other director: [[James Stewart]] in ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), [[Ronald Colman]] in ''[[A Double Life (1947 film)|A Double Life]]'' (1947), and [[Rex Harrison]] in ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964). One of Cukor's earlier ingenues was actress [[Katharine Hepburn]], who debuted in ''[[A Bill of Divorcement (1932 film)|A Bill of Divorcement]]'' (1932) and whose looks and personality left RKO officials at a loss as to how to use her. Cukor directed her in several films, both successful, such as ''[[Little Women (1933 film)|Little Women]]'' (1933) and ''[[Holiday (1938 film)|Holiday]]'' (1938), and disastrous, such as ''[[Sylvia Scarlett]]'' (1935). Cukor and Hepburn became close friends off the set.\n\nCukor was hired to direct ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' by Selznick in 1936, even before the book was published.<ref>McGilligan, p. 134.</ref> He spent the next two years involved with pre-production, including supervision of the numerous screen tests of actresses anxious to portray [[Scarlett O'Hara]]. Cukor favored Hepburn for the role, but Selznick, concerned about her reputation as \"box office poison\", would not consider her without a screen test, and the actress refused to film one. Of those who did, Cukor preferred [[Paulette Goddard]], but her supposedly illicit relationship with [[Charlie Chaplin]] (they were, in fact, secretly married) concerned Selznick.<ref>McGilligan, pp. 137\u201338.</ref>\n\nBetween his ''Wind'' chores, the director assisted with other projects. He filmed the cave scene for ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938 film)|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' (1938),<ref>McGilligan, pp. 139\u201340.</ref> and, following the firing of its original director [[Richard Thorpe]], Cukor spent a week on the set of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939). Although he filmed no footage, he made crucial changes to the look of Dorothy by eliminating [[Judy Garland]]'s blonde wig and adjusting her makeup and costume, encouraging her to act in a more natural manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=852&category=Notes |title=''The Wizard of Oz'' at Turner Classic Movies |publisher=Tcm.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref><ref>McGilligan, p. 145.</ref> Additionally, Cukor softened the Scarecrow's makeup and gave [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] a different hairstyle for the Wicked Witch of the West, as well as altering her makeup and other facial features. Cukor also suggested that the studio cast [[Jack Haley]], on loan from [[20th Century Fox]], as the Tin Man.\n\n[[File:DavidSelznick.jpg|thumb|left|David. O. Selznick]]\nCukor spent many hours coaching [[Vivien Leigh]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]] before the start of filming ''Wind'', but [[Clark Gable]] resisted his efforts to get him to master a Southern accent. However, despite rumors about Gable being uncomfortable with Cukor on the set, nothing in the internal memos of David O. Selznick indicates or suggests that Clark Gable played any role in Cukor's dismissal from the film. Rather, they show Selznick's mounting dissatisfaction with Cukor's slow pace and quality of work. From a private letter from journalist Susan Myrick to [[Margaret Mitchell]] in February 1939: \"George [Cukor] finally told me all about it. He hated [leaving the production] very much he said but he could not do otherwise. In effect he said he is an honest craftsman and he cannot do a job unless he knows it is a good job and he feels the present job is not right. For days, he told me he has looked at the rushes and felt he was failing...the things did not click as it should. Gradually he became convinced that the script was the trouble...So George just told David he would not work any longer if the script was not better and he wanted the [Sidney] Howard script back...he would not let his name go out over a lousy picture...and bull-headed David said 'OK get out!'\"<ref>Myrick, Susan White (1986), ''Columns in Hollywood: Reports from the Gwtw Sets'', Mercer University Press.</ref>\n\nSelznick had already been unhappy with Cukor (\"a very expensive luxury\") for not being more receptive to directing other Selznick assignments, even though Cukor had remained on salary since early 1937; and in a confidential memo written in September 1938, four months before principal photography began, Selznick flirted with the idea of replacing him with [[Victor Fleming]]. \"I think the biggest black mark against our management to date is the Cukor situation and we can no longer be sentimental about it.... We are a business concern and not patrons of the arts...\" Cukor was relieved of his duties, but he continued to work with Leigh and Olivia de Havilland off the set. Various rumors about the reasons behind his dismissal circulated throughout Hollywood. Selznick's friendship with Cukor had crumbled slightly when the director refused other assignments, including ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star is Born]]'' (1937) and ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1939).<ref>McGilligan, p. 139.</ref> Given that Gable and Cukor had worked together before (on ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'', 1934) and Gable had no objection to working with him then, and given Selznick's desperation to get Gable for Rhett Butler, if Gable had any objections to Cukor, certainly they would have been expressed before he signed his contract for the film.<ref>''Hollywood Studio Magazine'', \"The Great Directors\" September 1986.</ref> Yet, writer [[Gore Vidal]], in his autobiography ''Point to Point Navigation'', recounted that Gable demanded that Cukor be fired off ''Wind'' because, according to Cukor, the young Gable had been a male hustler and Cukor had been one of his johns.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vidal|first=Gore|title=Point to Point Navigation: A Memoir|year=2007|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-27501-1|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yP8KHNtT69gC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}</ref> This has been confirmed by Hollywood biographer E.J. Fleming, who has recounted that, during a particularly difficult scene, Gable erupted publicly, screaming: \"I can't go on with this picture. I won't be directed by a fairy. I have to work with a real man.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=E. J.|title=The Fixers: Eddie Mannix, Howard Strickling, and the MGM Publicity Machine|year=2005|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson NC|isbn=978-0-7864-2027-8|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0usSUISUUMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}</ref>\n\nCukor's dismissal from ''Wind'' freed him to direct ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), which has an all-female cast, followed by ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940). He also directed [[Greta Garbo]], another of his favorite actresses, in ''[[Two-Faced Woman]]'' (1941), her last film before she retired from the screen.\n\n[[File:Twofaced woman.jpg|thumb|Greta Garbo and [[Melvyn Douglas]] in \"Two-Faced Woman\" (1941)]]\nIn 1942, at the age of 43, Cukor enlisted in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]]. Following basic training at [[Fort Monmouth]], he was assigned to the old [[Kaufman Astoria Studios|Paramount]] studios in [[Astoria, Queens]] (where he had directed three films in the early 1930s), although he was permitted to lodge at the [[The St. Regis Hotel|St. Regis Hotel]] in Manhattan. Working with [[Irwin Shaw]], [[John Cheever]] and [[William Saroyan]], among others, Cukor produced training and instructional films for army personnel. Because he lacked an officer's commission, he found it difficult to give orders and directions to his superiors. Despite his efforts to rise above the rank of private\u2014he even called upon [[Frank Capra]] to intercede on his behalf\u2014he never achieved officer's status or any commendations during his six months of service. In later years, Cukor suspected his homosexuality impeded him from receiving any advances or honors,<ref>McGilligan, pp. 171\u201375.</ref> although rumors to that effect could not be confirmed.<ref>Levy, p. 150.</ref>\n\nThe remainder of the decade was a series of hits and misses for Cukor. Both ''Two-Faced Woman'' and ''[[Her Cardboard Lover]]'' (1942) were commercial failures. More successful were ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' (1941) with [[Joan Crawford]] and ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944) with [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Charles Boyer]]. During this era, Cukor forged an alliance with screenwriters [[Garson Kanin]] and [[Ruth Gordon]], who had met in Cukor's home in 1939 and married three years later. Over the course of seven years, the trio collaborated on seven films, including ''[[A Double Life (1947 film)|A Double Life]]'' (1947) starring [[Ronald Colman]], ''[[Adam's Rib]]'' (1949), ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]'' (1950), ''[[The Marrying Kind]]'' (1952), and ''[[It Should Happen to You]]'' (1954), all featuring [[Judy Holliday]], another Cukor favorite, who won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for ''Born Yesterday''.\n\n==Later Hollywood career==\n[[File:Judy Garland in A Star is Born trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Judy Garland, star of ''A Star is Born'']]\nIn December 1952, Cukor was approached by [[Sidney Luft|Sid Luft]], who proposed the director helm a musical remake of ''A Star is Born'' (1937) with his then-wife Judy Garland in the lead role. Cukor had declined to direct the earlier film because it was too similar to his own ''What Price Hollywood?'' (1932), but the opportunity to direct his first [[Technicolor]] film, first musical, and work with screenwriter [[Moss Hart]] and especially Garland appealed to him, and he accepted.<ref>McGilligan, 217-18.</ref> Getting the updated ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954) to the screen proved to be a challenge. Cukor wanted [[Cary Grant]] for the male lead and went so far as to read the entire script with him, but Grant, while agreeing it was the role of a lifetime, steadfastly refused to do it, and Cukor never forgave him. The director then suggested either [[Humphrey Bogart]] or [[Frank Sinatra]] tackle the part, but [[Jack L. Warner]] rejected both. [[Stewart Granger]] was the front runner for a period of time, but he backed out when he was unable to adjust to Cukor's habit of acting out scenes as a form of direction.<ref>McGilligan, pp. 219\u201320.</ref> [[James Mason]] eventually was contracted, and filming began on October 12, 1953. As the months passed, Cukor was forced to deal not only with constant script changes but a very unstable Garland, who was plagued by chemical and alcohol dependencies, extreme weight fluctuations, and real and imagined illnesses. In March 1954, a rough cut still missing several musical numbers was assembled, and Cukor had mixed feelings about it. When the last scene finally was filmed in the early morning hours of July 28, 1954, Cukor already had departed the production and was unwinding in Europe.<ref>McGilligan, pp. 224\u201326.</ref> The first preview the following month ran 210 minutes and, despite ecstatic feedback from the audience, Cukor and editor Folmar Blangsted trimmed it to 182 minutes for its New York premiere in October. The reviews were the best of Cukor's career, but Warner executives, concerned the running time would limit the number of daily showings, made drastic cuts without Cukor, who had departed for [[Pakistan]] to scout locations for the epic ''[[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]'' in 1954-1955. At its final running time of 154 minutes, the film had lost musical numbers and crucial dramatic scenes, and Cukor called it \"very painful.\"<ref>McGilligan, pp. 236\u201337.</ref> He was not included in the film's six Oscar nominations.\n\n[[File:Remick - Cukor - 1962.jpg|thumb|left|Rehearsing with [[Lee Remick]] in 1962]]\nOver the next ten years, Cukor directed a handful of films with varying success. ''[[Les Girls]]'' (1957) won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy]], and ''[[Wild Is the Wind]]'' (1957) earned Oscar nominations for [[Anna Magnani]] and [[Anthony Quinn]], but neither ''[[Heller in Pink Tights]]'' nor ''[[Let's Make Love]]'' (both 1960) were box office hits. Another project during this period was the ill-fated ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'', an updated remake of the comedy ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940). Cukor liked leading lady [[Marilyn Monroe]] but found it difficult to deal with her erratic work habits, frequent absences from the set, and the constant presence of her acting coach [[Paula Strasberg]]. After 32 days of shooting, the director had only 7\u00bd minutes of usable film.<ref name=\"Levy, p. 271\">Levy, p. 271.</ref> Then Monroe travelled to New York to appear at a birthday celebration for [[John F. Kennedy]] at Madison Square Garden, where she serenaded the president. Studio documents released after Monroe's death confirmed that her appearance at the political fundraising event was approved by Fox executives. The production came to a halt when Cukor had filmed every scene not involving Monroe and the actress remained unavailable. [[20th Century Fox]] executive Peter Levathes fired her and hired [[Lee Remick]] to replace her, prompting co-star [[Dean Martin]] to quit because his contract guaranteed he would be playing opposite Monroe.<ref>McGilligan, p. 272.</ref> With the production already $2 million over budget<ref name=\"Levy, p. 271\"/> and everyone back at the starting gate, the studio pulled the plug on the project. Less than two months later, Monroe was found dead in her home.\n\nTwo years later, Cukor achieved one of his greatest successes with ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964). Throughout filming there were mounting tensions between the director and designer [[Cecil Beaton]], but Cukor was thrilled with leading lady [[Audrey Hepburn]], although the crew was less enchanted with her diva-like demands.<ref>Levy, p. 289.</ref> Although several reviews were critical of the film \u2013 [[Pauline Kael]] said it \"staggers along\" and [[Stanley Kauffmann]] thought Cukor's direction was like \"a rich gravy poured over everything, not remotely as delicately rich as in the [[Anthony Asquith|Asquith]]-[[Leslie Howard (actor)|Howard]] 1937 [sic] ''[[Pygmalion (1938 film)|Pygmalion]]''\" \u2014<ref>Levy, p. 293.</ref> the film was a box office hit which won him the [[Academy Award for Best Director]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]], and the [[Directors Guild of America Award]] after having been nominated for each several times.\n\nFollowing ''My Fair Lady'', Cukor became less active. He directed [[Maggie Smith]] in ''[[Travels with My Aunt (film)|Travels with My Aunt]]'' (1972) and helmed the critical and commercial flop ''[[The Blue Bird (1976 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' (1976), the first joint Soviet-American production. He reunited twice with Katharine Hepburn for the television movies ''[[Love Among the Ruins (film)|Love Among the Ruins]]'' (1975) and ''[[The Corn Is Green]]'' (1979). He directed ''[[Rich and Famous (1981 film)|Rich and Famous]]'' (1981), his final film, with [[Jacqueline Bisset]] and [[Candice Bergen]], at the age of 82.\n\nIn 1976, Cukor was awarded the [[George Eastman Award]], given by [[George Eastman House]] for distinguished contribution to the art of film.<ref>[http://www.eastmanhouse.org/museum/awards.php The George Eastman Award] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415000000/http://www.eastmanhouse.org/museum/awards.php |date=April 15, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:George Cukor Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|Cukor at home in 1973]]\nIt was an open secret in Hollywood that Cukor was gay, at a time when society was against it, although he was discreet about his sexual orientation and \"never carried it as a pin on his lapel,\" as producer [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] put it.<ref>McGilligan, p. 113.</ref> He was a celebrated bon vivant whose luxurious home was the site of weekly Sunday afternoon parties attended by closeted celebrities and the attractive young men they met in bars and gyms and brought with them.<ref>McGilligan, pp. 186\u201387.</ref> At least once, in the midst of his reign at MGM, he was arrested on vice charges, but studio executives managed to get the charges dropped and all records of it expunged, and the incident was never publicized by the press.<ref>McGilligan, p. 133.</ref> In the late 1950s, Cukor became involved with a considerably younger man named George Towers. He financed his education at the [[California State University, Los Angeles|Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences]] and the [[University of Southern California]], from which Towers graduated with a law degree in 1967.<ref>McGilligan, pp. 277\u201378.</ref> That fall Towers married a woman, and his relationship with Cukor evolved into one of father and son, and for the remainder of Cukor's life the two remained very close.<ref>McGilligan, pp. 307, 347\u201348.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1930s, Cukor was not only established as a prominent director but, socially, as an unofficial head of Hollywood's gay subculture. His home, redecorated in 1935 by gay actor-turned-interior designer [[William Haines]] with gardens designed by [[Florence Yoch & Lucile Council]], was the scene of many gatherings for the industry's homosexuals. The close-knit group reputedly included Haines and his partner [[Jimmie Shields]], writer [[Somerset Maugham]], director [[James Vincent]], screenwriter [[Rowland Leigh]], costume designers [[Orry-Kelly]] and Robert Le Maire, and actors [[John Darrow]], [[Anderson Lawler]], [[Grady Sutton]], Robert Seiter and Tom Douglas. Frank Horn, secretary to Cary Grant, was also a frequent guest.<ref>Mann, William J.; ''Wisecracker: The Life and Times of William Haines, Hollywood's first Openly Gay Star''; New York: Viking, 1998; pp. 253, 255, 256.</ref>\n\nCukor's friends were of paramount importance to him and he kept his home filled with their photographs. Regular attendees at his famed soir\u00e9es included Katharine Hepburn and [[Spencer Tracy]], Joan Crawford and [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], [[Lauren Bacall]] and Humphrey Bogart, [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Laurence Olivier]] and Vivien Leigh, actor [[Richard Cromwell (actor)|Richard Cromwell]],  [[Stanley Holloway]], Judy Garland, [[Gene Tierney]], [[No\u00ebl Coward]], [[Cole Porter]], director [[James Whale]], costume designer [[Edith Head]], and [[Norma Shearer]], especially after the death of her first husband [[Irving Thalberg]]. He often entertained literary figures like [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Hugh Walpole]], [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Lesley Blanch]], [[Ferenc Moln\u00e1r]], and close friend Somerset Maugham.<ref>McGilligan, pp. 124\u201325.</ref><ref name=Walpole>{{cite book|last=Hart-Davis|first=Rupert|title=Hugh Walpole|year=1985|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|isbn=0-241-11406-3|pages=349, 360, 365, 369}}</ref>\n\n[[Frances Goldwyn]], second wife of studio mogul [[Sam Goldwyn]], long considered Cukor to be the love of her life, although their relationship remained platonic.

hood c.1915.jpg|thumb|A World War I British P Helmet c.1915]]\n\nThe '''gas mask''' is a [[mask]] used to protect the user from inhaling airborne [[pollutant]]s and toxic gases.  The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Some gas masks are also [[respirator]]s, though the word ''gas mask'' is often used to refer to military equipment (e.g. field protective mask). The user of the gas mask is not protected from gas that the skin can absorb. Most gas mask filters will last around 24 hours in a nuclear biological chemical (NBC) situation.\n\nAirborne toxic materials may be gaseous (for example, [[sulfur mustard]] and [[Chlorine|chlorine gas]]) or particulates (such as [[biological warfare|biological agents]]). Many gas masks include protection from both types. Gas masks are used in construction to protect against welding fumes, in demolition to protect against [[asbestos]] or other hazardous particles, and in the chemical industry when handling [[hazardous materials]], as in making repairs to leaking equipment or cleaning up after spills; workers are usually issued gas masks as a precaution against leaks.\n\nDuring demonstrations and protests where tear gas or CS-gas is employed by riot police, gas masks are commonly used by police and demonstrators alike. Aside from serving their functional purposes, gas masks are also used as emblems in [[industrial music]], with the most notable example, the [[subgenre]] of [[drum and bass]] called [[neurofunk]]. These emblems are used by [[graffiti]] taggers because the mask protects them from the paint canister's [[toxic|toxic fumes]], and by [[Urban exploration|urban explorers]] venturing into environments where hazardous materials, such as asbestos, may be present.\n\nThe traditional gas mask style with two small circular eye windows originated when the only suitable material for these eye windows was [[glass]] or [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]]; as glass is notoriously brittle, glass eye windows had to be kept small and thick. Later, the discovery of [[polycarbonate]] allowed for gas masks with a large full-face window. Some have one or two filters attached to the face mask while others have a large filter connected to the face mask with a hose, that is sometimes confused with respirators.{{clarify|post-text=(What kind of respirator?)|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Principles of construction==\n[[Absorption (chemistry)|Absorption]] is the process of being drawn into a (usually larger) body or substrate, and [[adsorption]] is the process of deposition upon a surface. This can be used to remove both particulate and gaseous hazards.  Although some form of [[chemical reaction|reaction]] may take place, it is not necessary; the method may work by attractive [[electric charge|charges]]. For example, if the target particles are positively charged, a negatively charged substrate may be used. Examples of substrates include [[activated carbon]], and [[zeolite]]s. This effect can be very simple and highly effective, for example using a damp cloth to cover the mouth and nose while escaping a fire.  While this method can be effective at trapping particulates produced by combustion, it does not filter out harmful gasses which may be toxic or which displace the oxygen required for survival.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:US Navy gas mask exercise 021015-N-6996M-589.jpg|[[MCU-2/P Protective Mask|MCU-2/P protective mask]] on a US Navy n and Lt. j.g.

The filter cartridge is connected via a flexible hose.\nFile:Gas mask greek.jpg|Greek Infantry with US [[M17 gas mask]]s\n</gallery>\n\n===Safety of old gas masks===\nGas masks have a limited useful lifespan that is related to the absorbent capacity of the filter. Once the filter has been saturated with hazardous chemicals, it ceases to provide protection and the user may be injured. Most gas masks use sealing caps over the air intake to prevent the filter from degrading before use, but the protective abilities also degrade as the filter ages or if it is exposed to moisture and heat. Very old unused gas mask filters from World War II may not be effective at all in protecting the user, and can even potentially cause harm to the user due to long-term changes in the filter chemical composition.\n[[File:2 Gasmaskenfilter.jpg|thumb|An asbestos-containing Russian GP-5 filter and a safe modern one in comparison.]]\n\nWorld War II gas masks contained [[chrysotile asbestos]] or [[Riebeckite#Crocidolite_(fibrous_riebeckite)|crocidolite asbestos]] in their filters.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Burns| first = Judith| title = Ban wartime gas masks, schools told| work = BBC News| accessdate = 2018-08-21| date = 2014-05-13| url = https://www.bbc.com/news/education-27391955}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Springer Science & Business Media| isbn = 978-1-4612-2496-9| last1 = Dail| first1 = David H.| last2 = Hammar| first2 = Samuel P.| last3 = Colby| first3 = Thomas V.| title = Pulmonary Pathology \u2014 Tumors| date = 2012-12-06 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSgyBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1005}}</ref> It is unknown how long for certain the materials were used in filters. Breathing blue asbestos in the factories resulted in the death of 10 percent of the workforce due to pleural and [[peritoneal mesothelioma]]. This rate was between 2.5 and 3.2 times the normal incidence of lung or respiratory cancers.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/oem.39.4.344 | title = Mortality of two groups of women who manufactured gas masks from chrysotile and crocidolite asbestos: a 40-year follow-up | year = 1982 | last1 = Acheson | first1 = E D | last2 = Gardner | first2 = M J | last3 = Pippard | first3 = E C | last4 = Grime | first4 = L P | journal = Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 39 | pages = 344\u20138 | pmid=6291580 | issue = 4 | pmc = 1009064}}</ref>\n\nMany stories have originated from various Russian gas masks and their filters that are now common in surplus stores; the [[GP-5 gas mask|GP-5]] was often considered to have an asbestos filter. The filter is made so that the asbestos fibres cannot be breathed in, if the filter layer is not damaged.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}  Nearly all Russian [[Cold War]] period masks contain asbestos, however, only the ones produced before 1972 pose a threat, and even then, the construction of the mask makes it impossible to breathe the asbestos in if not damaged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cwunea.org/article.php?articleid=1233|title=Health & Safety - Asbestos Danger from WW2 Gas Masks {{!}} CWU - North Anglia Branch|last=webdesign@mirandaz.co.uk|website=www.cwunea.org|access-date=2017-04-01}}</ref>\n\nModern gas masks are quite safe and do not use asbestos, but it is still important to be careful when using a modern gas mask. Typically, masks using 40&nbsp;mm connections are a more recent design. Rubber degrades with time, so new in-box \"modern type\" masks can be [[ozone cracking|cracked]] and leak. Also, the US C2 canister (black) was shown to contain [[hexavalent chromium]]: the studies by the [[U.S. Army Chemical Corps]] showed that the levels in the filter were acceptable, but imply caution when using, as it is a [[carcinogen]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n=== Filter classification ===\n\nThe filter is selected according to the toxic compound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/09/10010967/guide_for_selection_and_use_of_filtering_devices_9045782_en.pdf|title=Guide for selection and use of filtering devices|format=PDF|publisher=draeger.com}}</ref> Each filter type protects against a particular hazard:\n\n* AX - Low-boiling (\u226465&nbsp;\u00b0C) organic compounds\n* A - High-boiling (>65&nbsp;\u00b0C) organic compounds\n* B - Inorganic gases ([[hydrogen sulfide]], [[chlorine]], [[hydrogen cyanide]])\n* E - [[Sulfur dioxide]] and [[hydrogen chloride]] (acidic gases)\n* K - [[Ammonia]] and [[amine]]s\n* CO - [[Carbon monoxide]]\n* Hg - [[mercury (element)|Mercury]]\n* Reactor - [[Iodine]] and [[methyl iodide]] (radioactive)\n* P - Particles; classified as P1, P2, and P3 according to removal efficiency\n* ABEK, ABEK-P3, ABEK-HgP3 or other combination filters against multiple hazards\n\nParticle filters are often included, because in many cases, the hazardous materials are in the form of mist, which is captured already by the particle filter before entering the chemical adsorber. Filtration may be aided with an air pump to improve wearer comfort. Filtration of air is only possible if there is sufficient oxygen in the first place. Thus, when handling [[asphyxiant]]s, or when ventilation is poor or the hazards are unknown, filtration is not possible and air must be supplied from a pressurized bottle as in scuba diving. Also, a gas mask does not protect against other hazards; for example, corrosive gases can damage the skin, requiring full-body protection.\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Monmouth Regimental Museum - QRpedia 5.JPG|thumb|A 1939 Second World War-era baby's gas mask in [[Monmouth Regimental Museum]]. This design covered the whole of the baby except for its legs.]] \nA modern mask typically is constructed of an elastic polymer in various sizes. It is fitted with various adjustable straps which may be tightened to secure a good fit. Crucially, it is connected to a filter cartridge near the mouth either directly, or via a flexible hose. Some models contain drinking tubes which may be connected to a water bottle. Corrective lens inserts are also available for users who require them.\n\nMasks are typically tested for fit before use. After a mask is fitted, it is often tested by various challenge agents. [[Isoamyl acetate]], a synthetic banana flavourant, and [[camphor]] are often used as innocuous challenge agents. In the military, [[teargas]]es such as [[CN gas|CN]], [[CS gas|CS]], and [[stannic chloride]] in a chamber may be used to give the users confidence in the efficiency of the mask.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN32-4006.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020175705/http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN32-4006.pdf |archive-date=2012-10-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\n{{Further information| MOPP | NBC suit}}\n\n==Reaction and exchange==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nThis principle relies on substances harmful to humans being usually more reactive than air. This method of separation will use some form of generally reactive substance (for example an [[acid]]) coating or supported by some solid material. An example is [[synthetic resin]]s. These can be created with different groups of [[atom]]s (usually called [[functional group]]s) that have different properties. Thus a resin can be tailored to a particular toxic group. When the reactive substance comes in contact with the resin, it will bond to it, removing it from the air stream. It may also exchange with a less harmful substance at this site.\n\nThough it was crude, the [[hypo helmet]] was a stopgap measure for British troops in the trenches that offered at least some protection during a gas attack. As the months passed and poison gas was used more often, more sophisticated gas masks were developed and introduced. There are two main difficulties with gas mask design:\n\n*The user may be exposed to many types of toxic material. Military personnel are especially prone to being exposed to a diverse range of toxic gases. However, if the mask is for a particular use (such as the protection from a specific toxic material in a factory), then the design can be much simpler and the cost lower.\n*The protection will wear off over time. Filters will clog up, substrates for absorption will fill up, and reactive filters will run out of reactive substance. Thus the user only has protection for a limited time, and then he must either replace the filter device in the mask, or use a new mask.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Humboldt gasmask 1799.jpg|A primitive respirator was designed by A. von Humboldt in 1799 for underground mining\nImage:Various gas masks WWI.jpg|Various gas masks employed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] during World War I\nImage:1930s gas mask.jpg|[[Finland|Finnish]] civilian gas mask from 1939.

Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA74&dq=true#v=onepage&q=true&f=true \"Gas Mask Weighing Half As Much.\"] ''Popular Sciences'', March 1944, p. 74.</ref>\n\nGas mask development since has mirrored the development of chemical agents in warfare, filling the need to protect against ever more deadly threats, biological weapons, and radioactive dust in the nuclear era. However, where agents that cause harm through contact or penetration of the skin occurs, such as [[blister agent]] or [[nerve agent]], a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection, and full protective clothing must be worn in addition, to protect from contact with the atmosphere. For reasons of civil defense and personal protection, individuals often buy gas masks believing that they protect against the harmful effects of an attack with nuclear, biological, or chemical ([[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|NBC]]) agents; which is only partially true, as gas masks protect only against respiratory absorption. Whilst most military gas masks are designed to be capable of protection against all NBC agents, they can have filter canisters proof against those agents (heavier) or only against [[riot control agent]]s and smoke (lighter, and often used for training purposes); likewise there are lightweight masks solely for use in riot control agents and not for NBC situations.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAlthough thorough training and the availability of gas masks and other protective equipment can nullify the casualty-causing effects of an attack by chemical agents, troops who are forced to operate in full protective gear are less efficient in completing tasks, tire easily, and may be affected psychologically by the threat of attack by these weapons. During the [[Cold War]] era, it was seen as inevitable that there would be a constant NBC threat on the battlefield, and thus troops needed protection in which they could remain fully functional; thus protective gear, and especially gas masks have evolved to incorporate innovations in terms of increasing user-comfort, and in compatibility with other equipment (from drinking devices to artificial respiration tubes, to communications systems etc.). The gas mask has thus now arrived at a 'fourth generation' of development.\n\n[[File:Chemical weapon1.jpg|thumb|Iranian soldier wearing gas mask on the front-line of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]]]\nDuring the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u201388), Iraq developed [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|its chemical weapons program]] with the help of Europeans countries (such as Germany and France), and used them large-scale against Iranians as well as against Iraqi Kurd. Iran was unprepared for chemical warfare. In 1984, Iran received gas masks from the [[Republic of Korea]] and [[East Germany]], but the Korean masks were not suited for the faces of non-[[East Asian people]] and the filter only lasted for 15 minutes, and the 5,000 masks bought from East Germany proved to be not gas masks but spray painting goggles.

After his success with ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) he never composed an Italian opera again. Almost blind, and having lived in England for nearly fifty years, he died in 1759, a respected and rich man. His funeral was given full state honours, and he was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] in London.\n\nBorn the same year as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Domenico Scarlatti]], Handel is regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era, with works such as ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', ''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]'', and ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]'' remaining steadfastly popular.{{sfn|Buelow|2004|p=476}} One of his four [[Coronation Anthems (Handel)|coronation anthems]], ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'' (1727), composed for the coronation of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], has been performed at every subsequent [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation]], traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. Another of his English oratorios, ''[[Solomon (Handel)|Solomon]]'' (1748), has also remained popular, with the Sinfonia that opens act 3 (known more commonly as \"The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba\") featuring at the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012 London Olympics opening ceremony]].

A firm Lutheran, he nevertheless strongly advocated the separation of church and state, famously denouncing the witch trials then prevalent. Lang believes that Thomasius instilled in Handel a \"respect for the dignity and freedom of man's mind and the solemn majesty of the law,\" principles that would have drawn him to and kept him in England for half a century.{{sfn|Lang|1966|pp=20\u201321}} Handel also there encountered theologian and professor of Oriental languages [[August Hermann Francke]], who was particularly solicitous of children, particularly orphans. The orphanage he founded became a model for Germany, and undoubtedly influenced Handel's own charitable impulse, when he assigned the rights of ''Messiah'' to London's Foundling Hospital.{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Dom Halle.jpg|thumb|Domkirche in Halle]]\nShortly after commencing his university education, Handel (though Lutheran{{efn|Records of the Marktkirche show that he took communion there in April of the years 1701\u20133.<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=10}}; {{harvnb|Deutsch|1955|pp=8, 9, 10}}.</ref>}}) on 13 March 1702 accepted the position of organist at the Calvinist Cathedral in Halle, the Domkirche, replacing J.C. Leporin, for whom he had acted as assistant.{{sfn|Dent|1982|p=2}} The position, which was a one-year probationary appointment showed the foundation he had received from Zachow, for a church organist and cantor was a highly prestigious office. From it he received 5 thalers a year and lodgings in the run-down castle of Moritzburg. {{sfn|Burrows|1994|p=20}}\n\nAround this same time Handel made the acquaintance of [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]]. Four years Handel's senior, Telemann was studying law and assisting cantor [[Johann Kuhnau]] ([[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s predecessor at the [[Thomaskirche]] there). Telemann recalled forty years later in an autobiography for Mattheson's ''Grundlage'': \"The writing of the excellent Johann Kuhnau served as a model for me in fugue and counterpoint; but in fashioning melodic movements and examining them Handel and I were constantly occupied, frequently visiting each other as well as writing letters.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|pp=10\u201311}} translating {{harvnb|Mattheson|1740|p=359}}.</ref>\n\n=== Halle compositions ===\nAlthough Mainwaring records that Handel wrote weekly when assistant to Zachow and as probationary organist at Domkirche part of his duty was to provide suitable music,{{efn|Handel was required by the terms of his appointment, among other things, \"to play the organ fittingly at Divine Service, and for this purpose to pre-intone the prescribed Psalms and Spritual Songs, and to have due care to whatever might be needful to the support of beautiful harmony \u2026\"{{sfn|Deutsch|1955|p=9}}}} no sacred compositions from his Halle period can now be identified.{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=22 n.2}} Mattheson, however, summarized his opinion of Handel's church cantatas written in Halle: \"Handel in those days set very, very long arias and sheerly unending cantatas which, while not possessing the proper knack or correct taste, were perfect so far as harmony is concerned.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lang|1966|p=22}} translating {{harvnb|Mattheson|1740|p=93}}.</ref>\n\nEarly chamber works do exist, but it is difficult to date any of them to Handel's time in Halle. Many historians until recently followed Chrysander and designated the six trio sonatas for two oboes and basso continuo as his first known composition, supposedly written in 1696 (when Handel was 11).{{sfn|Deutsch|1955|p=4 n.1}} Lang doubts the dating based on a handwritten date of a copy (1700) and stylistic considerations. Lang writes that the works \"show thorough acquaintance with the distilled sonata style of the [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli school]]\" and are notable for \"the formal security and the cleanness of the texture.\"{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=23}} Hogwood considers all of the oboe trio sonatas spurious and even suggests that some parts cannot be performed on oboe.{{sfn|Hogwood|1984|p=21}}  That authentic manuscript sources do not exist and that Handel never recycled any material from these works make their authenticity doubtful.{{sfn|Best|1985|pp=486\u201389}} Other early chamber works were printed in Amsterdam in 1724 as opus 1, but it is impossible to tell which are early works in their original form, rather than later re-workings by Handel, a frequent practice of his.{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=23}}\n\n== From Halle to Italy ==\n[[File:Hamburgs Oper.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hamburg State Opera|Hamburg Opera am G\u00e4nsemarkt]] in 1726]]\n\nHandel's probationary appointment to Domkirche expired in March 1703.

Since he left no explanation for the move{{efn|Mainwaring gives the cryptic explanation that since he had to earn a living from his profession, he had to find a place less distant than Berlin. Given that Hamburg's opera house was second only to Berlin's in repute, \"it was resolved to send him thither on his own bottom, and chiefly with a view to improvement.\"{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|pp=27\u201328}} The passage suggests that Handel had already determined on secular dramatic music as a career, but who it was \"to send him thither\" is not explained.}} biographers have offered their own speculation. Burrows believes that the answer can be found by untangling Mainwaring's confused chronology of the trip to Berlin. Burrows dates this trip to 1702 or 1703 (after his father's death) and concluded that since Handel (through a \"friend and relation\" at the Berlin court) turned down Frederick's offer to subsidize his musical education in Italy (with the implicit understanding that he would become a court musician on his return), Handel was no longer able to expect preferment (whether as musician, lawyer or otherwise) within Brandenburg-Prussia. And since he was attracted to secular, dramatic music (by meeting the Italians Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti and through the influence of Telemann), Hamburg, a free city with an established opera company, was the logical choice.{{sfn|Burrows|1994|pp=11\u201313}} The question remains, however, why Handel rejected the King's offer, given that Italy was the center of opera. Lang suggests that, influenced by the teachings of Thomasius, Handel's character was such that he was unable to make himself subservient to anyone, even a king. Lang sees Handel as someone who could not accept class distinctions that required him to regard himself as a social inferior. \"What Handel craved was personal freedom to raise himself out of his provincial milieu to a life of culture.\"{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=26}} Burrows notes that like his father, Handel was able to accept royal (and aristocratic) favors without considering himself a court servant.{{sfn|Burrows|1994|p=12}} And so given the embarrassed financial condition of his mother,{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|p=29}} Handel set off for Hamburg to obtain experience while supporting himself.\n\nIn 1703 he accepted a position as violinist and harpsichordist in the orchestra of the Hamburg [[Oper am G\u00e4nsemarkt]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=18}}</ref> There he met the composers [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Christoph Graupner]] and [[Reinhard Keiser]].

Other sources say Handel was invited by [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]], whom Handel had met in 1703\u20131704 in Hamburg.{{sfn|Harris|2001|p=37}}. De' Medici, who had a keen interest in opera, was trying to make Florence Italy's musical capital by attracting the leading talents of his day. In Italy Handel met [[librettist]] [[Antonio Salvi]], with whom he later collaborated. Handel left for Rome and, since opera was (temporarily) banned in the [[Papal States]], composed sacred music for the Roman clergy. His famous ''[[Dixit Dominus (Handel)|Dixit Dominus]]'' (1707) is from this era. He also composed [[cantata]]s in [[pastoral]] style for musical gatherings in the palaces of cardinals [[Pietro Ottoboni (cardinal)|Pietro Ottoboni]], [[Benedetto Pamphili]] and [[Colonna family|Carlo Colonna]]. Two [[oratorio]]s, ''[[La resurrezione]]'' and ''[[Il trionfo del tempo e del disinganno|Il trionfo del tempo]]'', were produced in a private setting for [[Ruspoli#The. first Prince of Cerveteri \u2013 Francesco Maria Ruspoli|Ruspoli]] and Ottoboni <!--Better, which opera house there?-->in 1709 and 1710, respectively.

In March 1734 Handel composed a wedding anthem ''[[Wedding anthem for Princess Anne|This is the day which the Lord hath made]]'', and a [[serenata]] ''[[Parnasso in Festa]]'' for [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne, Princess Royal]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dent|2004|p=33}}</ref>\n\nDespite the problems the Opera of the Nobility was causing him at the time, Handel's neighbour in Brook Street, [[Mary Delany]], reported on a party she invited Handel to at her house on 12 April 1734 where he was in good spirits:<blockquote>I had Lady Rich and her daughter, Lady Cath. Hanmer and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Percival, Sir John Stanley and my brother, Mrs. Donellan, [[Anna Maria Strada|Strada]] [star soprano of Handel's operas]  and Mr. Coot.  Lord Shaftesbury begged of Mr. Percival to bring him, and being a profess'd friend of Mr. Handel (who was here also) was admitted; I never was so well entertained at an opera!  Mr. Handel was in the best humour in the world, and played lessons and accompanied Strada and all the ladies that sang from seven o'clock till eleven.  I gave them tea and coffee, and about half an hour after nine had a salver brought in of chocolate, mulled white wine and biscuits.

His most famous work, the oratorio ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' with its \"Hallelujah\" chorus, is among the most popular works in choral music and has become the centrepiece of the Christmas season. The [[Lobkowicz Palace]] in [[Prague]] holds [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] copy of ''Messiah'', complete with handwritten annotations. Among the works with opus numbers published and popularised in his lifetime are the [[Organ concertos, Op. 4 (Handel)|Organ Concertos Op. 4]] and [[Organ concertos, Op. 7 (Handel)|Op. 7]], together with the Opus 3 and [[Concerti grossi, Op. 6 (Handel)|Opus 6 concerti grossi]]; the latter incorporate an earlier organ concerto ''The Cuckoo and the Nightingale'' in which birdsong is imitated in the upper registers of the organ. Also notable are his sixteen keyboard suites, especially ''[[The Harmonious Blacksmith]]''.\n\nHandel introduced previously uncommon musical instruments in his works: the [[viola d'amore]] and [[violetta marina]] (''Orlando''), the lute (''Ode for St. Cecilia's Day''), three trombones (Saul), clarinets or small high cornetts (''Tamerlano''), [[theorbo]], French horn (''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]''), lyrichord, [[double bassoon]], [[viola da gamba]], [[carillon]] (bell chimes), [[positive organ]], and harp (''Giulio Cesare'', ''Alexander's Feast'').<ref>Textbook in CD ''Sacred Arias with Harp & Harp Duets by Rachel Ann Morgan & Edward Witsenburg.</ref>\n\n=== Catalogues ===\nThe first published catalogue of Handel's works appeared as an appendix to Mainwaring's ''Memoirs''.{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|pp=145\u201355}} Between 1787 and 1797 [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] compiled a 180-volume collection of Handel's works\u2014however, it was far from complete.{{sfn|Dean|1982|p=116}} Also incomplete was the collection produced between 1843 and 1858 by the English Handel Society (founded by [[George Alexander Macfarren|Sir George Macfarren]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.handel-edition.com/history.htm |title=A short history of editing Handel |author=The Halle Handel Edition |accessdate=3 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114021/http://www.handel-edition.com/history.htm |archivedate=3 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe 105-volume ''[[H\u00e4ndel-Gesellschaft]]'' (\"Handel Society\") edition was published between 1858 and 1902 \u2013 mainly due to the efforts of [[Friedrich Chrysander]].

It did not start as a critical edition, but after heavy criticism of the first volumes, which were performing editions without a critical apparatus (for example, the opera ''Serse'' was published with the title character recast as a tenor, reflecting pre-war German practice), it repositioned itself as a critical edition. Influenced in part by cold-war realities, editorial work was inconsistent: misprints are found in abundance and editors failed to consult important sources. In 1985 a committee was formed to establish better standards for the edition. The unification of Germany in 1990 removed communication problems, and the volumes issued have since shown a significant improvement in standards.{{sfn|Hicks|2013}}\n\nBetween 1978 and 1986 the German academic [[Bernd Baselt]] catalogued Handel's works in his ''[[H\u00e4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis]]'' publication.

The oratorios continued to be performed but not long after Handel's death they were thought to need some modernisation, and Mozart orchestrated German versions of ''Messiah'' and other works. Throughout the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, particularly in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries, his reputation rested primarily on his English oratorios, which were customarily performed by choruses of amateur singers on solemn occasions.  The centenary of his death, in 1859, was celebrated by a performance of ''Messiah'' at [[The Crystal Palace]], involving 2,765 singers and 460 instrumentalists, who played for an audience of about 10,000 people.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blyth|first1=Alan|title=Choral Music on Record|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=82}}</ref>\n\nRecent decades have revived his secular cantatas and what one might call 'secular oratorios' or 'concert operas'. Of the former, ''[[Ode for St. Cecilia's Day]]'' (1739) (set to texts by [[John Dryden]]) and ''[[Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne]]'' (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to classical mythology for subjects, producing such works as ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' (1719), ''[[Hercules (music drama)|Hercules]]'' (1745) and ''[[Semele (oratorio)|Semele]]'' (1744). These works have a close kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel's Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes fully staged as operas. With the rediscovery of his theatrical works, Handel, in addition to his renown as instrumentalist, orchestral writer, and melodist, is now perceived as being one of opera's great musical dramatists.\n\nThe original form of his name, Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel, is generally used in Germany and elsewhere, but he is known as \"Haendel\" in France.

Roberts demonstrated that Handel's borrowings were unusually frequent even for his own era, enough to have been criticised by contemporaries (notably [[Johann Mattheson]]); Roberts suggested several reasons for Handel's practice, including Handel's attempts to make certain works sound more up-to-date and more radically, his \"basic lack of facility in inventing original ideas\" \u2013 though Roberts took care to argue that this does not \"diminish Handel's stature\", which should be \"judged not by his methods, still less by his motives in employing them, but solely by the effects he achieves.\"<ref>John H.

The first movement from [[Louis Spohr]]'s ''Symphony No. 6'', Op. 116, \"The Age of Bach and Handel\", resembles two melodies from Handel's ''Messiah''. In 1797 [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] published the ''12 Variations in G major on \u2018See the conqu\u2019ring hero comes\u2019 from Judas Maccabaeus by Handel'', for cello and piano. In 1822 Beethoven composed ''[[The Consecration of the House]]'' overture, which also bears the influence of Handel. Guitar virtuoso [[Mauro Giuliani]] composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel, Op. 107'' for guitar, based on Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major, HWV 430, for harpsichord.\n[[File:Handel-Westminster.png|thumb|left|upright|Handel's monument in Westminster Abbey with the plaque recording his [[Handel Commemoration|commemoration]] in 1784]]\nIn 1861, using a theme from the second of Handel's harpsichord suites, [[Johannes Brahms]] wrote the ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel]]'', Op. 24, one of his most successful works (praised by [[Richard Wagner]]).  Several works by the French composer [[F\u00e9lix-Alexandre Guilmant]] use Handel's themes, for example his ''March on a Theme by Handel'' uses a theme from ''Messiah''. French composer and flautist [[Philippe Gaubert]] wrote his ''Petite marche'' for flute and piano based on the fourth movement of Handel's Trio Sonata, Op. 5, No. 2, HWV 397. [[Argentine people|Argentine]] composer Luis Gianneo composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel'' for piano. In 1911, Australian-born composer and pianist [[Percy Grainger]] based one of his most famous works on the final movement of Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major (just like Giuliani). He first wrote some variations on the theme, which he titled ''Variations on Handel's 'The Harmonious Blacksmith' ''. Then he used the first sixteen bars of his set of variations to create ''Handel in the Strand'', one of his most beloved pieces, of which he made several versions (for example, the piano solo version from 1930). [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra in B-flat major (1933) was composed after Handel's Concerto Grosso, Op. 6/7.<ref>Auner Joseph H.

In the [[Calendar of saints (Lutheran)|Lutheran Calendar of Saints]] Handel and Bach share that date with [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], and Handel and Bach are commemorated in the calendar of saints prepared by the [[Order of Saint Luke]] for the use of the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>''For All the Saints: A Calendar of Commemorations for United Methodists'', ed. by Clifton F.

It was made at [[Denham Studios]] by the [[Rank Organisation]], and shot in [[Technicolor]]. He is also the central character in the television films ''[[God Rot Tunbridge Wells!]]'' (1985) and ''[[Handel's Last Chance]]'' (1996) and the stage play ''[[All the Angels]]'' (2015). Handel was portrayed as the antagonist in the film ''[[Farinelli_(film)|Farinelli]]'' (1994).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Classical music|Opera|Music|Biography}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel}}\n* [[Handel Reference Database]]\n* [[Letters and writings of George Frideric Handel]]\n* [[List of compositions by George Frideric Handel]]\n* [[List of operas by George Frideric Handel]]\n* [[Publications by Friedrich Chrysander]]\n* [[Valentine Snow]]\n* [[Will of George Frideric Handel]]\n* [[Drexel 5856]]\n\n== Notes, references and sources ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Aileen K.|last2=Hofest\u00e4dt|first2=B.|title=Georg H\u00e4ndel (1622\u201397): The Barber-Surgeon Father of George Frideric Handel (1685\u20131759)|work=Journal of Medical Biography|volume=13|issue=3|pages=142\u201349|date=August 2005|pmid=16059526|ref=harv|doi=10.1258/j.jmb.2005.04-49}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Best|first=Terence|title=Handel's Chamber Music: Sources, Chronology and Authenticity|work=Early Music|volume=13|number=4|date=November 1985|pp=476\u201399|subscription=yes|ref=harv|doi=10.1093/em/13.4.476|jstor = 3127226}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bone|first=Philip J.|title=The Guitar and Mandolin: Biographies of Celebrated Players and Composers for these Instruments|location=London|publisher=Schott & Co.|year=1914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Buelow|first=George J.|title=A History of Baroque Music|location=Bloomington, Indiana|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-253-34365-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bukofzer|first=Manfred F.|authorlink=Manfred Bukofzer|title='Music in the Baroque Era \u2013 From Monteverdi To Bach|location=New York|publisher=W.W.

He studied with [[Robin Mallapert]] and [[Firmin Lebel]]. He spent most of his career in the city.\n\nPalestrina came of age as a musician under the influence of the northern European style of polyphony, which owed its dominance in Italy primarily to two influential [[Netherlandish]] composers, [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Josquin des Prez]], who had spent significant portions of their careers there. Italy itself had yet to produce anyone of comparable fame or skill in polyphony.<ref name=Roche/>\n\nFrom 1544 to 1551, Palestrina was the organist of the [[Cathedral of St. Agapito]], the principal church of his native city. In 1551 [[Pope Julius III]] (previously the [[Bishop of Palestrina]]) appointed Palestrina ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' or musical director of the [[Cappella Giulia]]<ref>Lino Bianchi, ''Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina</ref>, (Julian Chapel, in the sense of choir), the choir of the chapter of canons at [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Palestrina dedicated to Julius III his first published compositions (1554), a book of [[Mass (music)|Masses]]. It was the first book of Masses by a native composer, since in the Italian states of Palestrina's day, most composers of sacred music were from the [[Low Countries]], France, Portugal,<ref>Manuel Mendes, Ant\u00f3nio Carreira, Duarte Lobo, Filipe de Magalh\u00e3es, Fr.

In fact the book was modeled on one by [[Crist\u00f3bal de Morales]]: the woodcut in the front is almost an exact copy of the one from the book by the Spanish composer.\n\n[[File:Facade San Giovanni in Laterano 2006-09-07.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|St John Lateran]], Rome, where Palestrina was musical director]]\nDuring the next decade, Palestrina held positions similar to his Julian Chapel appointment at other chapels and churches in Rome, notably [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|St. John Lateran]] (1555\u20131560, a post previously held by [[Lassus]]), and St Mary Major (1561\u20131566). In 1571 he returned to the Julian Chapel and remained at St Peter's for the rest of his life. The decade of the 1570s was difficult for him personally: he lost his brother, two of his sons, and his wife in three separate outbreaks of the plague (1572, 1575, and 1580, respectively). He seems to have considered becoming a priest at this time, but instead he remarried, this time to a wealthy widow. This finally gave him financial independence (he was not well paid as choirmaster) and he was able to compose prolifically until his death.\n\nHe died in Rome of [[pleurisy]] in 1594. As was usual, Palestrina was buried on the same day he died, in a plain coffin with a lead plate on which was inscribed ''[[Libera me]] Domine''. A five-part psalm for three choirs was sung at the funeral.<ref name=Pyne>Zoe Kendrick Pyne, ''Giovanni Pierluigi di Palestrina: His Life and Times'' (London: Bodley Head, 1922).</ref> Palestrina's funeral was held at St. Peter's, and he was buried beneath the floor of the basilica.

According to this tale (which forms the basis of [[Hans Pfitzner]]'s opera [[Palestrina (opera)|''Palestrina'']]), it was composed in order to persuade the [[Council of Trent]] that a draconian ban on the [[polyphony|polyphonic]] treatment of text in sacred music (as opposed, that is, to a more directly intelligible homophonic treatment) was unnecessary.<ref name=\"Bokina\">John Bokina, ''Opera and Politics'' (New York: Yale University Press, 1997), pp. 129\u2013131.</ref> However, more recent scholarship shows that this mass was in fact composed before the cardinals convened to discuss the ban (possibly as much as ten years before).<ref name=\"Bokina\" /> Historical data indicates that the Council of Trent, as an official body, never actually banned any church music and failed to make any ruling or official statement on the subject. These stories originated from the unofficial points-of-view of some Council attendees who discussed their ideas with those not privy to the Council's deliberations. Those opinions and rumors have, over centuries, been transmuted into fictional accounts, put into print, and often incorrectly taught as historical fact. While Palestrina's compositional motivations are not known, he may have been quite conscious of the need for intelligible text; however, this was not to conform with any doctrine of the [[Counter-Reformation]],<ref name=\"Bokina\" /> because no such doctrine exists.  His characteristic style remained consistent from the 1560s until the end of his life.  Roche's hypothesis that Palestrina's seemingly dispassionate approach to expressive or emotive texts could have resulted from his having to produce many to order, or from a deliberate decision that any intensity of expression was unbecoming in church music,<ref name=\"Roche\" /> reflects modern expectations about expressive freedom and underestimates the extent to which the mood of Palestrina's settings is adapted to the liturgical occasions for which the texts were set, rather than the line-by-line meaning of the text, and depends on the distinctive characters of the church [[Gregorian mode|modes]] and variations in vocal grouping for expressive effect. Performing editions and recordings of Palestrina have tended to favour his works in the more familiar modes and standard (SATB) voicings, under-representing the expressive variety of his settings. \n\nThere are two comprehensive editions of Palestrina's works: a 33-volume edition published by Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel, in [[Leipzig]] Germany between 1862 and 1894 edited by [[Franz Xaver Haberl]], and a 34-volume edition published in the mid twentieth century, by Fratelli Scalera, in Rome, Italy edited by [[w:it:Raffaele Casimiri|R. Casimiri]] and others. \n\n==The 'Palestrina Style'==\nOne of the hallmarks of Palestrina's music is that dissonances are typically relegated to the [[Off-beat (music)|\"weak\" beats]] in a measure.<ref name=Jeppesen>Knud Jeppesen, ''Counterpoint: The Polyphonic Vocal Style of the Sixteenth Century'', trans. Glen Haydon (with a new foreword by Alfred Mann; New York: Prentice-Hall, 1939, repr. New York: Dover, 1992).</ref> This produced a smoother and more consonant type of [[polyphony]] which is now considered to be definitive of late Renaissance music, given Palestrina's position as Europe's leading composer (along with [[Orlande de Lassus]]) in the wake of [[Josquin des Prez]] (d. 1521).    \n\nThe \"Palestrina style\" taught in college courses covering Renaissance [[counterpoint]] is often based on the codification by the 18th-century composer and theorist [[Johann Joseph Fux]], published as ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' (Steps to Parnassus, 1725). Citing Palestrina as his model, Fux divided counterpoint into five ''species'' (hence the term \"[[species counterpoint]]\"), designed as exercises for the student, which deployed progressively more elaborate rhythmic combinations of voices while adhering to strict harmonic and melodic requirements. The method was widely adopted and was the main basis of contrapuntal training in the 19th century, but Fux had introduced a number of simplifications to the Palestrina style, notably the obligatory use of a ''[[cantus firmus]]'' in [[semibreves]], which were corrected by later authors such as [[Knud Jeppesen]] and [[R. O. Morris]]. Palestrina's music conforms in many ways to Fux's rules, particularly in the fifth species but does not fit his pedagogical format.    \n\nThe main insight, that the \"pure\" style of polyphony achieved by Palestrina followed an invariable set of stylistic and combinational requirements, was justified. Fux's manual was endorsed by his contemporary [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]], who himself arranged two of Palestrina's masses for performance.   \n\nAccording to Fux, Palestrina had established and followed these basic guidelines:\n\n* The flow of music is dynamic, not rigid or static.\n* Melody should contain few leaps between notes. (Jeppesen: \"The line is the starting point of Palestrina's style\".)<ref name=Jeppesen/>\n* If a leap occurs, it must be small and immediately countered by stepwise motion in the opposite direction.\n* Dissonances are to be confined to suspensions, passing notes and weak beats. If one falls on a strong beat (in a suspension) it must be immediately resolved.\n\nNot mentioned by Fux, was the manner in which the musical phrasing of Palestrina followed the [[syntax]] of the sentences he was setting to music,\nsomething not always observed by earlier composers. Also to be noticed in Palestrina is a great deal of [[tone painting]]. Elementary examples of this are descending musical motion with latin words like ''descendit'' (descends) or of a static musical or cadential moment with the words ''de coelis'' (from heaven). <ref>{{cite book|last=Georgiades|first=Thrasybulos|year=1974|title=Music and Language The Rise of Western Music as Exemplified in Settings of the Mass|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\n==Reputation==\nPalestrina was extremely famous in his day, and if anything, his reputation and influence increased after his death.

If the wavepacket has a narrow range of frequencies, and {{math|''\u03c9''(''k'')}} is approximately linear over that narrow range, the pulse distortion will be small, in relation to the small nonlinearity.

Loosely speaking, different frequency-components of the wavepacket travel at different speeds, with the faster components moving towards the front of the wavepacket and the slower moving towards the back. Eventually, the wave packet gets stretched out. This is an important effect in the propagation of signals through [[optical fiber]]s and in the design of high-power, short-pulse lasers.\n\n=== History ===\nThe idea of a group velocity distinct from a wave's [[phase velocity]] was first proposed by [[William Rowan Hamilton|W.R.

In most cases this is accurate, and the group velocity can be thought of as the [[signal velocity]] of the [[wave]]form. However, if the wave is travelling through an absorptive or gainful medium, this does not always hold.

The peaks of wavepackets were also seen to move faster than {{mvar|c}}.\n\nIn all these cases, however, there is no possibility that signals could be carried [[faster than light|faster than the speed of light in vacuum]], since the high value of {{mvar|v}}<sub>{{mvar|g}}</sub> does not help to speed up the true motion of the sharp wavefront that would occur at the start of any real signal. Essentially the seemingly superluminal transmission is an artifact of the narrow band approximation used above to define group velocity and happens because of resonance phenomena in the intervening medium. In a wide band analysis it is seen that the apparently paradoxical speed of propagation of the signal envelope is actually the result of local interference of a wider band of frequencies over many cycles, all of which propagate perfectly causally and at phase velocity. The result is akin to the fact that shadows can travel faster than light, even if the light causing them always propagates at light speed; since the phenomenon being measured is only loosely connected with causality, it does not necessarily respect the rules of causal propagation, even if it under normal circumstances does so and leads to a common intuition.<ref name=Boyd1170885/><ref name=\"DEWSL06\">{{Citation |first1=Gunnar |last1=Dolling |first2=Christian |last2=Enkrich |first3=Martin |last3=Wegener |first4=Costas M. |last4=Soukoulis |first5=Stefan |last5=Linden |title=Simultaneous Negative Phase and Group Velocity of Light in a Metamaterial |journal=Science |volume=312 |pages=892\u2013894 |year=2006 |doi=10.1126/science.1126021 |pmid=16690860 |issue=5775 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312..892D }}</ref><ref name=\"BLSB06\">{{Citation |first1=Matthew S. |last1=Bigelow |first2=Nick N. |last2=Lepeshkin |first3=Heedeuk |last3=Shin |first4=Robert W. |last4=Boyd |title=Propagation of a smooth and discontinuous pulses through materials with very large or very small group velocities |journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter |volume=18 |pages=3117\u20133126 |year=2006 |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/18/11/017 |issue=11|bibcode = 2006JPCM...18.3117B }}</ref><ref name=\"GSBKB06\">{{Citation |first1=George M. |last1=Gehring |first2=Aaron |last2=Schweinsberg |first3=Christopher |last3=Barsi |first4=Natalie |last4=Kostinski |first5=Robert W. |last5=Boyd |title=Observation of a Backward Pulse Propagation Through a Medium with a Negative Group Velocity |journal=Science |volume=312 |pages=895\u2013897 |year=2006 |doi=10.1126/science.1124524 |pmid=16690861 |issue=5775|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..895G }}</ref><ref name=\"SLBBJ05\">{{Citation |first1=A. |last1=Schweinsberg |first2=N.

The [[cyclic group]] ''C''<sub>3</sub> consisting of the rotations by 0\u00b0, 120\u00b0 and 240\u00b0 acts on the set of the three vertices.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''action''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a formal way of interpreting the manner in which the elements of the group correspond to transformations of some [[Space (mathematics)|space]] in a way that preserves the [[mathematical structure|structure]] of that space. Common examples of spaces that groups act on are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[vector spaces]], and [[topological spaces]]. Actions of groups on vector spaces are called [[Group representation|representations]] of the group.\n\nWhen there is a natural correspondence between the set of group elements and the set of space transformations, a group can be interpreted as acting on the space in a [[canonical map|canonical]] way. For example, the [[symmetric group]] of a finite [[set (mathematics)|set]] consists of all [[bijective]] transformations of that set; thus, applying any element of the permutation group to an element of the set will produce another (not necessarily distinct) element of the set. More generally, [[symmetry groups]] such as the [[homeomorphism group]] of a [[topological space]] or the [[general linear group]] of a [[vector space]], as well as their subgroups, also admit canonical actions. For other groups, an interpretation of the group in terms of an action may have to be specified, either because the group does not act canonically on any space or because the canonical action is not the action of interest. For example, we can specify an action of the two-element [[cyclic group]] <math>\\mathrm{C}_2 = \\{0,1\\}</math> on the finite set <math>\\{a,b,c\\}</math> by specifying that 0 (the identity element) sends <math>a\\mapsto a,b\\mapsto b,c\\mapsto c</math>, and that 1 sends <math>a\\mapsto b,b\\mapsto a,c\\mapsto c</math>. This action is not canonical.\n\nA common way of specifying non-canonical actions is to describe a [[homomorphism]] <math>\\varphi</math> from a group ''G'' to the group of symmetries of a set ''X''. The action of an element <math>g\\in G</math> on a point <math>x\\in X</math> is assumed to be identical to the action of its image <math>\\varphi(g) \\in \\text{Sym}(X)</math> on the point <math>x</math>. The homomorphism <math>\\varphi</math> is also frequently called the \"action\" of ''G'', since specifying <math>\\varphi</math> is equivalent to specifying an action. Thus, if ''G'' is a group and ''X'' is a set, then an action of ''G'' on ''X'' may be formally defined as a [[group homomorphism]] <math>\\varphi</math> from ''G'' to the [[symmetric group]] of ''X''. The action assigns a [[permutation]] of ''X'' to each element of the group in such a way that:\n* the [[identity element]] of ''G'' is assigned the [[identity transformation]] of ''X'';\n* any product ''gk'' of two elements of ''G'' is assigned the [[function composition|composition]] of the permutations assigned to ''g'' and&nbsp;''k''.\nIf ''X'' has additional structure, then <math>\\varphi</math> is only called an action if for each <math>g\\in G</math>, the permutation <math>\\varphi(g)</math> preserves the structure of&nbsp;''X''.\n\nThe [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] provided by group actions is a powerful one, because it allows geometrical ideas to be applied to more abstract objects. Many objects in mathematics have natural group actions defined on them. In particular, groups can act on other groups, or even on themselves. Because of this generality, the theory of group actions contains wide-reaching [[theorem]]s, such as the orbit stabilizer theorem, which can be used to prove deep results in several fields.\n\n== Definition ==\nIf ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and ''X'' is a set, then a (''left'') ''group action'' ''&phi;'' of ''G'' on ''X'' is a function\n:<math>\\varphi\\colon G \\times X \\to X\\colon (g,x)\\mapsto \\varphi(g,x)</math>\nthat satisfies the following two axioms (where we denote ''&phi;''(''g'', ''x'') as ''g''\u22c5''x''):<ref>{{cite book|author=Eie & Chang |title=A Course on Abstract Algebra|year=2010|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=jozIZ0qrkk8C|page=144|text=group action}}|page=144}}</ref>\n; Identity: {{nowrap|1=''e''\u22c5''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''X''. (Here, ''e'' denotes the identity element of the group ''G''.)\n; Compatibility: {{nowrap|1=(''gh'')\u22c5''x'' = ''g''\u22c5(''h''\u22c5''x'')}} for all ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''. (Here, ''gh'' denotes the result of applying the group operation of ''G'' to the elements ''g'' and ''h''.)\n\nThe group ''G'' is said to act on ''X'' (on the left). The set ''X'' is called a (''left'') ''G-set''.\n\nFrom these two axioms, it follows that for every ''g'' in ''G'', the function which maps ''x'' in ''X'' to ''g''\u22c5''x'' is a [[bijective function|bijective map]] from ''X'' to ''X'' (its [[inverse function|inverse]] being the function which maps ''x'' to ''g''<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5''x''). Therefore, one may alternatively define a group action of ''G'' on ''X'' as a [[group homomorphism]] from ''G'' into the [[symmetric group]] Sym(''X'') of all bijections from ''X'' to ''X''.<ref>This is done, e.g., by {{cite book|author=Smith |title=Introduction to abstract algebra|year=2008|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=PQUAQh04lrUC|page=253|text=group action}}|page=253}}</ref>\n\nIn complete analogy, one can define a ''right group action'' of ''G'' on ''X'' as an operation {{nowrap|''X'' \u00d7 ''G'' \u2192 ''X''}} mapping {{nowrap|(''x'', ''g'')}} to ''x''\u22c5''g'' and satisfying the two axioms:\n; Identity: {{nowrap|1=''x''\u22c5''e'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''X''.\n; Compatibility: {{nowrap|1=''x''\u22c5(''gh'') = (''x''\u22c5''g'')\u22c5''h''}} for all ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X'';\n\nThe difference between left and right actions is in the order in which a product like ''gh'' acts on ''x''. For a left action ''h'' acts first and is followed by ''g'', while for a right action ''g'' acts first and is followed by ''h''. Because of the formula {{nowrap|1=(''gh'')<sup>\u22121</sup> = ''h''<sup>\u22121</sup>''g''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, one can construct a left action from a right action by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, a right action of a group ''G'' on ''X'' is the same thing as a left action of its [[opposite group]] ''G''<sup>op</sup> on ''X''. It is thus sufficient to only consider left actions without any loss of generality.\n\n== Types of actions ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Diffeomorphism]], and redirected from \"Transitive action\" -->\nThe action of ''G'' on ''X'' is called\n* ''{{visible anchor|Transitive}}'' if ''X'' is non-empty and if for each pair ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''y''}}. For example, the action of the symmetric group of ''X'' is transitive, the action of the [[general linear group]] or the [[special linear group]] of a vector space ''V'' on {{nowrap|''V'' \u2216 {0}{{null}}}} is transitive, but the action of the [[orthogonal group]] of a [[Euclidean space]] ''E'' is not transitive on {{nowrap|''E'' \u2216 {0}{{null}}}} (it is transitive on the [[unit sphere]] of ''E'', though).\n* ''{{visible anchor|Faithful}}'' (or ''{{visible anchor|effective}}'') if for every two distinct ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' \u2260 ''h''\u22c5''x''}}; or equivalently, if for each {{nowrap|''g'' \u2260 ''e''}} in ''G'' there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' such that {{nowrap|''g''\u22c5''x'' \u2260 ''x''}}.  In other words, in a faithful group action, different elements of ''G'' induce different permutations of ''X''. In algebraic terms, a group ''G'' acts faithfully on ''X'' [[if and only if]] the corresponding homomorphism to the symmetric group, {{nowrap|''G'' \u2192 Sym(''X'')}}, has a trivial [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]]. Thus, for a faithful action, ''G'' embeds into a [[permutation group]] on ''X''; specifically, ''G'' is isomorphic to its image in Sym(''X''). If ''G'' does not act faithfully on ''X'', one can easily modify the group to obtain a faithful action. If we define {{nowrap|1=''N'' = {''g'' in ''G'' : ''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''x'' for all ''x'' in ''X''}{{null}}}}, then ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G''; indeed, it is the kernel of the homomorphism {{nowrap|''G'' \u2192 Sym(''X'')}}. The [[factor group]] ''G''/''N'' acts faithfully on ''X'' by setting {{nowrap|1=(''gN'')\u22c5''x'' = ''g''\u22c5''x''}}. The original action of ''G'' on ''X'' is faithful if and only if {{nowrap|1=''N'' = {''e''}{{null}}}}.\n* ''{{visible anchor|Free}}'' (or ''semiregular'' or ''fixed point free'') if, given ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'', the existence of an ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''h''\u22c5''x''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''h''}}. Equivalently: if ''g'' is a group element and there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''x''}} (that is, if ''g'' has at least one fixed point), then ''g'' is the identity. Note that a free action on a [[non-empty]] set is faithful.\n* ''{{visible anchor|Regular}}'' (or ''{{visible anchor|simply transitive}}'' or ''sharply transitive'') if it is both transitive and free; this is equivalent to saying that for every two ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists precisely one ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''y''}}.  In this case, ''X'' is called a [[principal homogeneous space]] for ''G'' or a ''G''-torsor. The action of any group ''G'' on itself by left multiplication is regular, and thus faithful as well. Every group can, therefore, be embedded in the symmetric group on its own elements, Sym(''G''). This result is known as [[Cayley's theorem]].\n* ''{{visible anchor|n-transitive}}'' if ''X'' has at least ''n'' elements and for all pairwise distinct ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>'' and pairwise distinct ''y''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''y<sub>n</sub>'' there is a ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x<sub>k</sub>'' = ''y<sub>k</sub>''}} for {{nowrap|1 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n''}}.  A 2-transitive action is also called ''{{visible anchor|doubly transitive}}'', a 3-transitive action is also called ''triply transitive'', and so on.  Such actions define interesting classes of subgroups in the symmetric groups: [[2-transitive group]]s and more generally [[multiply transitive group]]s. The action of the symmetric group on a set with ''n'' elements is always ''n''-transitive; the action of the [[alternating group]] is ''n-2''-transitive.\n* ''{{visible anchor|Sharply n-transitive}}'' if there is exactly one such ''g''.\n* ''{{visible anchor|Primitive}}'' if it is transitive and preserves no non-trivial partition of ''X''. See [[primitive permutation group]] for details.\n* ''Locally free'' if ''G'' is a [[topological group]], and there is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] ''U'' of ''e'' in ''G'' such that the restriction of the action to ''U'' is free; that is, if  {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''x''}} for some ''x'' and some ''g'' in ''U'' then {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''e''}}.\n\nFurthermore, if <math>G</math> acts on a [[topological space]] <math>X</math>, then the action is:\n\n*''Wandering'' if every point <math> x \\in X </math> has a neighbourhood <math> U </math> such that <math>\\{g \\in G : g \\cdot U \\cap U \\neq \\emptyset\\}</math> is finite.<ref name=\"Thurston 1980 p175\">{{Citation | last1=Thurston | first1=William | title=The geometry and topology of three-manifolds | url=http://library.msri.org/books/gt3m/ | series=Princeton lecture notes | year=1980 | page=175}}</ref> For example, the action of <math>\\mathbb Z^n</math> on <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> by translations is wandering.

The ''orbit'' of an element ''x'' in ''X'' is the set of elements in ''X'' to which ''x'' can be moved by the elements of ''G''. The orbit of ''x'' is denoted by ''G''\u22c5''x'':\n\n:<math> G\\cdot x = \\left\\{ g\\cdot x \\mid g \\in G \\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe defining properties of a group guarantee that the set of orbits of (points ''x'' in) ''X'' under the action of ''G'' form a [[partition of a set|partition]] of ''X''. The associated [[equivalence relation]] is defined by saying {{nowrap|''x'' \u223c ''y''}} [[if and only if]] there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''y''}}. The orbits are then the [[equivalence class]]es under this relation; two elements ''x'' and ''y'' are equivalent if and only if their orbits are the same; i.e., {{nowrap|1=''G''\u22c5''x'' = ''G''\u22c5''y''}}.\n\nThe group action is [[Group action#Types of actions|transitive]] if and only if it has exactly one orbit, i.e., if there exists ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''G''\u22c5''x'' = ''X''}}. This is the case if and only if {{nowrap|1=''G''\u22c5''x'' = ''X''}} for ''all'' ''x'' in ''X''.\n\nThe set of all orbits of ''X'' under the action of ''G'' is written as ''X''/''G'' (or, less frequently: ''G''\\''X''), and is called the ''quotient'' of the action. In geometric situations it may be called the ''{{visible anchor|orbit space}}'', while in algebraic situations it may be called the space of ''{{visible anchor|coinvariants}}'', and written ''X<sub>G</sub>'',  by contrast with the invariants (fixed points), denoted ''X<sup>G</sup>'': the coinvariants are a ''quotient'' while the invariants are a ''subset.'' The coinvariant terminology and notation are used particularly in [[group cohomology]] and [[group homology]], which use the same superscript/subscript convention.\n\n===Invariant subsets===\nIf ''Y'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', we write ''GY'' for the set {{nowrap|{ ''g''\u22c5''y'' : ''y'' \u2208 ''Y'' and ''g'' \u2208 ''G''}<nowiki/>}}. We call the subset ''Y'' ''invariant under G'' if {{nowrap|1=''G''\u22c5''Y'' = ''Y''}} (which is equivalent to {{nowrap|''G''\u22c5''Y'' \u2286 ''Y''}}). In that case, ''G'' also operates on ''Y'' by restricting the action to ''Y''. The subset ''Y'' is called ''fixed under G'' if {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''y'' = ''y''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''y'' in ''Y''. Every subset that is fixed under ''G'' is also invariant under ''G'', but not vice versa.\n\nEvery orbit is an invariant subset of ''X'' on which ''G'' acts [[Group action#Types of actions|transitively]]. The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is ''transitive'' if and only if all elements are equivalent, meaning that there is only one orbit.\n\nA ''G-invariant'' element of ''X'' is {{nowrap|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''x''}} for all {{nowrap|''g'' \u2208 ''G''}}. The set of all such ''x'' is denoted ''X<sup>G</sup>'' and called the ''G-invariants'' of ''X''. When ''X'' is a [[G-module|''G''-module]], ''X<sup>G</sup>'' is the zeroth [[group cohomology]] group of ''G'' with coefficients in ''X'', and the higher cohomology groups are the [[derived functor]]s of the [[functor]] of ''G''-invariants.\n\n===Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups===\nGiven ''g'' in ''G'' and ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''x''}}, we say ''x'' is a fixed point of ''g'' and ''g'' fixes ''x''.\n\nFor every ''x'' in ''X'', we define the ''stabilizer subgroup'' of ''G'' with respect to ''x'' (also called the ''isotropy group'' or ''little group''<ref name=\"Procesi\">{{cite book|last1=Procesi|first1=Claudio|title=Lie Groups: An Approach through Invariants and Representations|date=2007|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9780387289298|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sl8OAGYRz_AC&pg=PA5&dq=%22little+group%22+action&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiP0P3X5qbSAhXriFQKHfNLDDsQ6AEIODAF#v=onepage&q=%22little%20group%22%20action&f=false|accessdate=23 February 2017|language=en}}</ref>) as the set of all elements in ''G'' that fix ''x'':\n:<math>G_x = \\{g \\in G \\mid g \\cdot x = x\\}.</math>\nThis is a [[subgroup]] of ''G'', though typically not a normal one. The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is [[Group action#Types of actions|free]] if and only if all stabilizers are trivial. The kernel ''N'' of the homomorphism with the symmetric group, {{nowrap|''G'' \u2192 Sym(''X'')}}, is given by the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the stabilizers ''G<sub>x</sub>'' for all ''x'' in ''X''. If ''N'' is trivial, the action is said to be faithful (or effective).\n\nLet ''x'' and ''y'' be two elements in ''X'', and let ''g'' be a group element such that {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''g''\u22c5''x''}}. Then the two stabilizer groups ''G<sub>x</sub>'' and ''G<sub>y</sub>'' are related by {{nowrap|1=''G<sub>y</sub>'' = ''g'' ''G<sub>x</sub>'' ''g''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}. Proof: by definition, {{nowrap|''h'' &isin; ''G<sub>y</sub>''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''h''\u22c5(''g''\u22c5''x'') = ''g''\u22c5''x''}}. Applying ''g''<sup>\u22121</sup> to both sides of this equality yields {{nowrap|1=(''g''<sup>\u22121</sup>''hg'')\u22c5''x'' = ''x''}}; that is, {{nowrap|''g''<sup>\u22121</sup>''hg'' &isin; ''G<sub>x</sub>''}}. An opposite inclusion follows similarly by taking {{nowrap|''h'' &isin; ''G<sub>x</sub>''}} and supposing {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''g''<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5''y''}}.\n\nThe above says that the stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are [[Conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other. Thus, to each orbit, one can associate a conjugacy class of a subgroup of ''G'' (i.e., the set of all conjugates of the subgroup). Let <math>(H)</math> denote the conjugacy class of ''H''. Then one says that the orbit ''O'' has type <math>(H)</math> if the stabilizer <math>G_x</math> of some/any ''x'' in ''O'' belongs to <math>(H)</math>. A maximal orbit type is often called a [[principal orbit type]].\n\n==={{visible anchor|Orbit-stabilizer theorem}} and Burnside's lemma===\nOrbits and stabilizers are closely related. For a fixed ''x'' in ''X'', consider the map from ''G'' to ''X'' given by {{nowrap|''g'' \u21a6 ''g''\u22c5''x''}} for all {{nowrap|''g'' \u2208 ''G''}}. The [[image (mathematics)|image]] of this map is the orbit of ''x'' and the [[coimage]] is the set of all left [[coset]]s of ''G<sub>x</sub>''. The standard quotient theorem of set theory then gives a natural [[bijection]] between ''G''/''G<sub>x</sub>'' and ''G''\u22c5''x''. Specifically, the bijection is given by ''hG<sub>x</sub>'' \u21a6 ''h''\u22c5''x''. This result is known as the ''orbit-stabilizer theorem''. From a more categorical perspective, the orbit-stabilizer theorem comes from the fact that every ''G''-set is a sum of quotients of the ''G''-set ''G''. \n\nIf ''G'' is finite then the orbit-stabilizer theorem, together with [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], gives\n:<math>|G\\cdot x| = [G\\,:\\,G_x] = |G| / |G_x|.</math>\n\nThis result is especially useful since it can be employed for counting arguments (typically in situations where ''X'' is finite as well).\n\n[[File:Labeled cube graph.png|thumb|Cubical graph with vertices labeled]]\n'''Example:'''  One can use the orbit-stabilizer theorem to count the automorphisms of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. Consider the [[cubical graph]] as pictured, and let <math>G</math> denote its [[Graph automorphism|automorphism]] group. Then <math>G</math> acts on the set of vertices <math>\\{1,2,\\ldots,8\\}</math>, and this action is transitive as can be seen by composing rotations about the center of the cube. Thus, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we have that <math>|G| = |G\\cdot1||G_1| = 8|G_1|</math>. Applying the theorem now to the stabilizer <math>G_1</math>, we obtain <math>|G_1| = |(G_1)\\cdot2||(G_1)_2|</math>. Any element of <math>G</math> that fixes <math>1</math> must send <math>2</math> to either <math>2</math>, <math>4</math> or <math>5</math>. There are such automorphisms; consider for example the map that transposes <math>2</math> and <math>4</math>, transposes <math>6</math> and <math>8</math>, and fixes the other vertices. Thus, <math>\\left|(G_1)\\cdot2\\right| = 3</math>. Applying the theorem a third time gives <math>|(G_1)_2| = |((G_1)_2)\\cdot3||((G_1)_2)_3|</math>. Any element of <math>G</math> that fixes <math>1</math> and <math>2</math> must send <math>3</math> to either <math>3</math> or <math>6</math>, and one easily finds such automorphisms. Thus, <math>\\left|((G_1)_2)\\cdot3\\right| = 2</math>.

Combining the preceding calculations, we now obtain <math>|G| = 8\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1 = 48</math>.\n\nA result closely related to the orbit-stabilizer theorem is [[Burnside's lemma]]:\n:<math>\\left|X/G\\right|=\\frac{1}{\\left|G\\right|}\\sum_{g\\in G}\\left|X^g\\right|</math>,\n\nwhere ''X<sup>g</sup>'' is the set of points fixed by ''g''. This result is mainly of use when ''G'' and ''X'' are finite, when it can be interpreted as follows: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of points fixed per group element.\n\nFixing a group ''G'', the set of formal differences of finite ''G''-sets forms a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] called the [[Burnside ring]] of ''G'', where addition corresponds to [[disjoint union]], and multiplication to [[Cartesian product]].\n\n== Examples ==\n* The ''{{visible anchor|trivial}}'' action of any group ''G'' on any set ''X'' is defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''; that is, every group element induces the [[identity function|identity permutation]] on ''X''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eie & Chang |title=A Course on Abstract Algebra|year=2010|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=jozIZ0qrkk8C|page=144|text=trivial action}}|page=145}}</ref>\n* In every group ''G'', left multiplication is an action of ''G'' on ''G'': {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''gx''}} for all ''g'', ''x'' in ''G''.\n* In every group ''G'' with subgroup ''H'', left multiplication is an action of ''G'' on the set of cosets ''G/H'': {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''aH'' = ''gaH''}} for all ''g'',''a'' in ''G''. In particular if H contains no nontrivial normal subgroups of ''G'' this induces an isomorphism from ''G'' to a subgroup of the permutation group of degree ''[G : H]''.\n* In every group ''G'', [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] is an action of ''G'' on ''G'': {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''x'' = ''gxg''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}. An exponential notation is commonly used for the right-action variant: {{nowrap|1=''x<sup>g</sup>'' = ''g''<sup>\u22121</sup>''xg''}}; it satisfies ({{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>''g''</sup>)<sup>''h''</sup> = ''x''<sup>''gh''</sup>}}.\n* In every group ''G'' with subgroup ''H'', [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] is an action of ''G'' on conjugates of ''H'': {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''K'' = ''gKg<sup>\u22121</sup>''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and ''K'' conjugates of ''H''.\n* The [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub> and its [[subgroup]]s act on the set {{nowrap|{ 1, \u2026, ''n'' }<nowiki/>}} by permuting its elements\n* The [[symmetry group]] of a [[polyhedron]] acts on the set of vertices of that polyhedron. It also acts on the set of faces or the set of edges of the polyhedron.\n* The symmetry group of any geometrical object acts on the set of points of that object.\n* The [[automorphism group]] of a [[vector space]] (or [[graph theory|graph]], or group, or [[ring (algebra)|ring]]\u2026) acts on the vector space (or set of vertices of the graph, or group, or ring\u2026).\n* The [[general linear group]] {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''K'')}} and its subgroups, particularly its [[Lie subgroup]]s (including the [[special linear group]] {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''K'')}}, [[orthogonal group]] {{nowrap|O(''n'', ''K'')}}, special orthogonal group {{nowrap|SO(''n'', ''K'')}}, and [[symplectic group]] {{nowrap|Sp(''n'', ''K'')}}) are [[Lie group]]s that act on the [[vector space]] ''K''<sup>''n''</sup>.

The orbits of its action are classified by the greatest common divisor of coordinates of the vector in '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n* The [[affine group]] acts [[#Types of actions|transitively]] on the points of an [[affine space]], and the subgroup V of the affine group (i.e., a vector space) transitive and free (i.e., ''regular'') action on these points;<ref>{{cite book|title=Geometry and topology|last=Reid|first=Miles|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780521613255|location=Cambridge, UK New York|pages=170|via=}}</ref> indeed this can be used to give a definition of an [[Affine space#Definition|affine space]].\n* The [[projective linear group]] {{nowrap|PGL(''n'' + 1, ''K'')}} and its subgroups, particularly its Lie subgroups, which are Lie groups that act on the [[projective space]] '''P'''<sup>n</sup>(''K''). This is a quotient of the action of the general linear group on projective space. Particularly notable is {{nowrap|PGL(2, ''K'')}}, the symmetries of the projective line, which is sharply 3-transitive, preserving the [[cross ratio]]; the [[M\u00f6bius group]] {{nowrap|PGL(2, '''C''')}} is of particular interest.\n*The [[Isometry|isometries]] of the plane act on the set of 2D images and patterns, such as [[wallpaper group|wallpaper pattern]]s. The definition can be made more precise by specifying what is meant by image or pattern; e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. Isometries are in fact one example of affine group (action).{{dubious|reason=The isometries of a space are a subgroup of the affine group of that space, but not an affine group in themselves|date=March 2015}}\n*The sets acted on by a group G comprise the category of G-sets in which the objects are G-sets and the morphisms are G-set homomorphisms: functions {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5(''f''(''x'')) = ''f''(''g''\u22c5''x'')}} for every ''g'' in ''G''.\n* The [[Galois group]] of a [[field extension]] ''L''/''K'' acts on the field L but has only a trivial action on elements of the subfield K. Subgroups of Gal(L/K) correspond to subfields of L that contain K, i.e., intermediate field extensions between L and K.\n* The additive group of the [[real number]]s {{nowrap|('''R''', +)}} acts on the [[phase space]] of \"[[well-behaved]]\" systems in [[classical mechanics]] (and in more general [[dynamical systems]]) by [[time translation]]: if ''t'' is in '''R''' and ''x'' is in the phase space, then ''x'' describes a state of the system, and {{nowrap|''t'' + ''x''}} is defined to be the state of the system ''t'' seconds later if ''t'' is positive or &minus;''t'' seconds ago if ''t'' is negative.\n*The additive group of the real numbers {{nowrap|('''R''', +)}} acts on the set of real functions of a real variable in various ways, with (''t''\u22c5''f'')(''x'') equal to, e.g., {{nowrap|''f''(''x'' + ''t'')}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') + ''t''}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''xe<sup>t</sup>'')}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'')''e<sup>t</sup>''}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'' + ''t'')''e<sup>t</sup>''}}, or {{nowrap|''f''(''xe<sup>t</sup>'') + ''t''}}, but not {{nowrap|''f''(''xe<sup>t</sup>'' + ''t'')}}.\n*Given a group action of ''G'' on ''X'', we can define an induced action of ''G'' on the [[power set]] of ''X'', by setting {{nowrap|1=''g''\u22c5''U'' = {''g''\u22c5''u'' : ''u'' \u2208 ''U''}<nowiki/>}} for every subset ''U'' of ''X'' and every ''g'' in ''G''. This is useful, for instance, in studying the action of the large [[Mathieu group]] on a 24-set and in studying symmetry in certain models of [[finite geometry|finite geometries]].\n* The [[quaternions]] with [[Norm of a quaternion|norm]] 1 (the [[versor]]s), as a multiplicative group, act on '''R'''<sup>3</sup>: for any such quaternion {{nowrap|1=''z'' = cos ''\u03b1''/2 + '''v''' sin ''\u03b1''/2}}, the mapping {{nowrap|1=''f''('''x''') = ''z'''''x'''''z''<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is a counterclockwise rotation through an angle ''\u03b1'' about an axis given by a unit vector '''v'''; ''z'' is the same rotation; see [[quaternions and spatial rotation]].\n\n== Group actions and groupoids ==\nThe notion of group action can be put in a broader context by using the ''action [[groupoid]]'' <math>\\scriptstyle G' \\;=\\;  G \\,\\ltimes\\, X</math>  associated to the group action, thus allowing techniques from groupoid theory such as presentations and [[fibration]]s. Further the stabilizers of the action are the vertex groups,  and the orbits of the action are the components, of the action groupoid. For more details, see the book ''Topology and groupoids'' referenced below.\n\nThis action groupoid comes with a morphism <math>\\scriptstyle p:\\; G' \\,\\rightarrow\\, G</math> which is a ''covering morphism of groupoids''. This allows a relation between such morphisms and [[covering maps]] in topology.\n\n== Morphisms and isomorphisms between ''G''-sets ==\nIf ''X'' and ''Y'' are two ''G''-sets, we define a ''[[morphism]]'' from ''X'' to ''Y'' to be a function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f''(''g''\u22c5''x'') = ''g''\u22c5''f''(''x'')}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''. Morphisms of ''G''-sets are also called ''[[equivariant map]]s'' or ''G-maps''.\n\nThe composition of two morphisms is again a morphism.\n\nIf a morphism ''f'' is [[bijective]], then its inverse is also a morphism, and we call ''f'' an ''[[isomorphism]]'' and the two ''G''-sets ''X'' and ''Y'' are called ''isomorphic''; for all practical purposes, they are indistinguishable in this case.\n\nSome example isomorphisms:\n* Every regular ''G'' action is isomorphic to the action of ''G'' on ''G'' given by left multiplication.\n* Every free ''G'' action is isomorphic to {{nowrap|''G'' \u00d7 ''S''}}, where ''S'' is some set and ''G'' acts on {{nowrap|''G'' \u00d7 ''S''}} by left multiplication on the first coordinate. (''S'' can be taken to be the set of orbits ''X''/''G''.)\n* Every transitive ''G'' action is isomorphic to left multiplication by ''G'' on the set of left [[coset]]s of some [[subgroup]] ''H'' of ''G''. (''H'' can be taken to be the stabilizer group of any element of the original ''G''-set.the original action.)\n\nWith this notion of morphism, the collection of all ''G''-sets forms a [[category theory|category]]; this category is a [[Grothendieck topos]] (in fact, assuming a classical metalogic, this topos will even be Boolean).\n\n== Continuous group actions ==\n{{main article|continuous group action}}\n\nOne often considers ''continuous group actions'': the group ''G'' is a [[topological group]], ''X'' is a [[topological space]], and the map {{nowrap|''G'' \u00d7 ''X'' \u2192 ''X''}} is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] with respect to the [[product topology]] of {{nowrap|''G'' \u00d7 ''X''}}. The space ''X'' is also called a ''G-space'' in this case. This is indeed a generalization, since every group can be considered a topological group by using the [[discrete space|discrete topology]]. All the concepts introduced above still work in this context, however we define morphisms between ''G''-spaces to be ''continuous'' maps compatible with the action of ''G''. The quotient ''X''/''G'' inherits the [[quotient topology]] from ''X'', and is called the ''quotient space'' of the action. The above statements about isomorphisms for regular, free and transitive actions are no longer valid for continuous group actions.\n\nIf ''X'' is a [[Covering map#Deck transformation group, regular covers|regular covering space]] of another topological space ''Y'', then the action of the [[Covering map#Deck transformation group, regular covers|deck transformation group]]  on ''X'' is properly discontinuous as well as being free. Every free, properly discontinuous action of a group ''G'' on a [[path-connected]] topological space ''X'' arises in this manner: the quotient map {{nowrap|''X'' \u21a6 ''X''/''G''}} is a regular covering map, and the deck transformation group is the given action of ''G'' on ''X''. Furthermore, if ''X'' is simply connected, the fundamental group of ''X''/''G'' will be isomorphic to ''G''.\n\nThese results  have been generalized in the book ''Topology and Groupoids'' referenced below to obtain the [[fundamental groupoid]] of the orbit space of a discontinuous action of a discrete group on a Hausdorff space, as,  under reasonable  local conditions, the orbit groupoid of the fundamental groupoid of the space. This allows calculations such as the fundamental group of the [[symmetric square]] of a space ''X'', namely the orbit space of the product of ''X'' with itself under the twist action of the cyclic group of order 2 sending {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} to {{nowrap|(''y'', ''x'')}}.\n\nAn action of a group ''G'' on a [[locally compact space]] ''X'' is ''cocompact'' if there exists a compact subset ''A'' of ''X'' such that {{nowrap|1=''GA'' = ''X''}}. For a properly discontinuous action, cocompactness is equivalent to compactness of the quotient space ''X/G''.\n\nThe action of ''G'' on ''X'' is said to be ''proper'' if the mapping {{nowrap|''G'' \u00d7 ''X'' \u2192 ''X'' \u00d7 ''X''}} that sends {{nowrap|(''g'', ''x'') \u21a6 (''g\u22c5x'', ''x'')}} is a [[proper map]].\n\n===Strongly continuous group action and smooth points===\nA group action of a topological group ''G'' on a topological space ''X'' is said to be ''strongly continuous'' if for all ''x'' in ''X'', the map {{nowrap|''g'' \u21a6 ''g''\u22c5''x''}} is continuous with respect to the respective topologies. Such an action induces an action on the space of continuous functions on ''X'' by defining {{nowrap|1=(''g''\u22c5''f'')(''x'') = ''f''(''g''<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5''x'')}} for every ''g'' in ''G'', ''f'' a continuous function on ''X'', and ''x'' in ''X''. Note that, while every continuous group action is strongly continuous, the converse is not in general true.<ref>{{cite web\n| last       = Yuan\n| first      = Qiaochu\n| title      = wiki's definition of \"strongly continuous group action\" wrong?\n| publisher  = Mathematics Stack Exchange\n| date       = 27 February 2013\n| url        = http://math.stackexchange.com/q/316042\n| accessdate = 1 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe subspace of ''smooth points'' for the action is the subspace of ''X'' of points ''x'' such that {{nowrap|''g'' \u21a6 ''g''\u22c5''x''}} is smooth; i.e., it is continuous and all derivatives{{where|date=August 2013}} are continuous.\n\n== Variants and generalizations ==\nOne can also consider actions of [[monoid]]s on sets, by using the same two axioms as above. This does not define bijective maps and equivalence relations however. See [[semigroup action]].\n\nInstead of actions on sets, one can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an arbitrary [[category theory|category]]: start with an object ''X'' of some category, and then define an action on ''X'' as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of endomorphisms of ''X''. If ''X'' has an underlying set, then all definitions and facts stated above can be carried over. For example, if we take the category of [[vector space]]s, we obtain [[group representation]]s in this fashion.\n\nOne can view a group ''G'' as a category with a single object in which every [[morphism]] is invertible. A (left) group action is then nothing but a (covariant) [[functor]] from ''G'' to the [[category of sets]], and a group representation is a functor from ''G'' to the [[category of vector spaces]]. A morphism between G-sets is then a [[natural transformation]] between the group action functors.  In analogy, an action of a [[groupoid]] is a functor from the groupoid to the category of sets or to some other category.\n\nIn addition to [[continuous group action|continuous actions]] of topological groups on topological spaces, one also often considers [[Lie group action|smooth actions]] of [[Lie groups]] on [[manifold|smooth manifold]]s, regular actions of [[algebraic group]]s on [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], and [[group-scheme action|actions]] of [[group scheme]]s on [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. All of these are examples of [[group object]]s acting on objects of their respective category.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Measurable group action]]\n* [[Gain graph]]\n* [[Group with operators]]\n* [[Monoid action]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|last1=Aschbacher|first1=Michael|author1-link=Michael Aschbacher|title=Finite Group Theory|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|mr=1777008 |isbn=978-0-521-78675-1}}\n* Brown, Ronald (2006).

The most commonly known is the GNU Project's implementation using [[LZ77|Lempel-Ziv]] coding (LZ77). [[OpenBSD]]'s version of gzip is actually the compress program, to which support for the gzip format was added in OpenBSD 3.4. The 'g' in this specific version stands for ''[[wikt:gratis|gratis]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://man.openbsd.org/gzip.1#HISTORY|title=OpenBSD gzip(1) manual page|website=Openbsd.org|accessdate=2018-02-04|publisher=OpenBSD}}</ref> [[FreeBSD]], [[DragonFly BSD]] and [[NetBSD]] use a BSD-licensed implementation instead of the GNU version; it is actually a [[command-line interface]] for [[zlib]] intended to be compatible with the GNU implementation's options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://man.freebsd.org/gzip|title=gzip|publisher=Man.freebsd.org|date=2011-10-09|accessdate=2014-03-01}}</ref> These implementations originally come from [[NetBSD]], and support decompression of [[bzip2]] and the Unix [[pack (compression)|pack]] format.\n\nAn alternative compression program achieving 3-8% better compression is [[Zopfli]]. It achieves gzip-compatible compression using more exhaustive algorithms, at the expense of compression (but not decompression) time.\n\n== Derivatives and other uses ==\nThe [[tar (computing)|tar]] utility included in most Linux distributions can extract .tar.gz files by passing the {{mono|z}} option, e.g., {{mono|tar -zxf file.tar.gz}}.\n\n[[zlib]] is an abstraction of the DEFLATE algorithm in library form which includes support both for the gzip file format and a lightweight stream format in its API. The zlib stream format, DEFLATE, and the gzip file format were standardized respectively as RFC 1950, RFC 1951, and RFC 1952.\n\nThe gzip format is used in [[HTTP compression]], a technique used to speed up the sending of [[HTML]] and other content on the [[World Wide Web]]. It is one of the three standard formats for HTTP compression as specified in RFC 2616.

Liquid anaesthetics are vapourised in the machine.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nMany compounds have been used for inhalation anaesthesia, but only a few are still in widespread use. [[Desflurane]], [[isoflurane]] and [[sevoflurane]] are the most widely used [[volatile anaesthetic]]s today. They are often combined with [[nitrous oxide]].

General anesthetics that agonize them are typically used to induce a state of sedation and/or unconsciousness. Such drugs include [[propofol]], [[etomidate]], [[isoflurane]], [[benzodiazepine]]s ([[midazolam]], [[lorazepam]], [[diazepam]]), and [[barbiturate]]s ([[sodium thiopental]], [[methohexital]]).<ref name=\":04\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":25\" />\n\n==== NMDA receptor antagonists ====\n* [[Ketamine]], an [[NMDA receptor]] antagonist, is used primarily for its analgesic effects and in an [[Off-label use|off-label]] capacity for its anti-depressant effects. This drug, however, also alters arousal and is often used in parallel with other general anesthetics to help maintain a state of general anesthesia. Administration of ketamine alone leads to a dissociative state, in which a patient may experience auditory and visual [[hallucination]]s. Additionally, the perception of pain is dissociated from the perception of noxious stimuli. Ketamine appears to bind preferentially to the NMDA receptors on GABAergic interneurons, which may partially explain its effects.<ref name=\":04\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":25\" />\n\n==== Two-pore potassium channels (K<sub>2P</sub>s) activation ====\n* [[Two-pore-domain potassium channel|Two-pore potassium channels (K<sub>2P</sub>s)]] modulate the potassium conductance that contributes to the [[Resting potential|resting membrane potential]] in neurons. Opening of these channels therefore facilitates a [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarizing]] current, which reduces neuronal excitability. K<sub>2P</sub>s have been found to be affected by general anesthetics (esp. halogenated inhalational anesthetics) and are currently under investigation as potential targets. The K<sub>2P</sub> channel family comprises six subfamilies, which includes 15 unique members. 13 of these channels (excluding TWIK-1 and TWIK-2 homomers) are affected by general anesthetics. While it has not been determined that general anesthetics bind directly to these channels, nor is it clear how these drugs affect K<sub>2P</sub> conductance, [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] studies have shown that certain general anesthetics result in K<sub>2P</sub> channel activation. This drug-elicited channel activation has been shown to be dependent upon specific amino-acids within certain K<sub>2P</sub> channels (i.e. TREK-1 and TASK channels). Furthermore, the effects of certain general anesthetics are less pronounced in K<sub>2P</sub> [[Knockout mouse|knock-out mice]], as compared to their [[Wild type|wild-type]] counterparts. Cumulatively, TASK-1, [[KCNK9|TASK-3]], and [[KCNK2|TREK-1]] are particularly well supported as playing a role in the induction of general anesthesia.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":32\" /><ref name=\":42\" />\n\n==== Others ====\n* [[Opioid receptor]] agonists are primarily utilized for their analgesic effects. These drugs, however, can also elicit sedation. This effect is mediated by opioid actions on both opioid and acetylcholine receptors. While these drugs can lead to decreased arousal, they do not elicit a loss of consciousness. For this reason, they are often used in parallel with other general anesthetics to help maintain a state of general anesthesia. Such drugs include [[morphine]], [[fentanyl]], [[hydromorphone]], and [[remifentanil]].<ref name=\":04\" /><ref name=\":25\" />\n* Administration of the [[Adrenergic receptor|alpha2 adrenergic receptor]] agonist [[dexmedetomidine]] leads to sedation that resembles [[non-REM]] sleep. It is used in parallel with other general anesthetics to help maintain a state of general anesthesia, in an off-label capacity. Notably, patients are easily aroused from this non-REM sleep state.<ref name=\":04\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":25\" />\n* [[Dopamine receptor]] antagonists have sedative and [[antiemetic]] properties. Previously, they were used in parallel with opioids to elicit neuroleptic anesthesia ([[catalepsy]], analgesia, and unresponsiveness). They are no longer used in the context, because patients experiencing neuroleptic anesthesia were frequently aware of the medical procedures being performed, but could not move or express emotion. Such drugs include [[haloperidol]] and [[droperidol]].<ref name=\":04\" />\n{{See also|Theories of general anaesthetic action}}\n*\n\n== Physiological side effects ==\nAside from the clinically advantageous effects of general anesthetics, there are a number of other physiological consequences mediated by this class of drug. Notably, a reduction in blood pressure can be facilitated by a variety of mechanisms, including reduced cardiac contractility and dilation of the vasculature. This drop in blood pressure may activate a reflexive increase in heartrate, due to a [[Baroreceptor reflex|baroreceptor-mediated feedback mechanism]]. Some anesthetics, however, disrupt this reflex.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":25\" />\n[[File:PEO-puke_finger.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PEO-puke_finger.svg|thumb|173x173px|Nausea and vomiting following general anesthesia remains a pervasive side-effect]]\nPatients under general anesthesia are at greater risk of developing [[hypothermia]], as the aforementioned [[vasodilation]] increases the heat lost via peripheral blood flow. By and large, these drugs reduce the internal body temperature threshold at which autonomic [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] mechanisms are triggered in response to cold. (On the other hand, the threshold at which thermoregulatory mechanisms are triggered in response to heat is typically increased.)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bindra|first=Ashish|last2=Bindu|first2=Barkha|last3=Rath|first3=Girija|date=2017-07-01|title=Temperature management under general anesthesia: Compulsion or option|url=http://www.joacp.org/text.asp?2017/33/3/306/214311|journal=Journal of Anaesthesiology Clinical Pharmacology|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|doi=10.4103/joacp.joacp_334_16}}</ref>\n\nAnesthetics typically affect respiration. Inhalational anesthetics elicit [[Bronchodilator|bronchodilation]], an increase in respiratory rate, and reduced [[tidal volume]]. The net effect is decreased respiration, which must be managed by healthcare providers, while the patient is under general anesthesia.<ref name=\":25\" /> The reflexes that function to alleviate airway obstructions are also dampened (e.g. gag and cough). Compounded with a reduction in [[lower esophageal sphincter]] tone, which increases the frequency of regurgitation, patients are especially prone to [[asphyxiation]] while under general anesthesia. Healthcare providers closely monitor individuals under general anesthesia and utilize a number of devices, such as an [[endotracheal tube]], to ensure patient safety.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nGeneral anesthetics also effect the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] and [[Vomiting center|brainstem vomiting center]], eliciting nausea and vomiting following treatment.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n==Pharmacokinetics==\n\n=== Intravenous general anesthetics ===\n\n====Induction====\n\nIntravenously-delivered general anesthetics are typically small and highly [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] molecules. These characteristics facilitate their rapid preferential distribution into the brain and spinal cord, which are both highly vascularized and lipophilic. It is here where the actions of these drugs lead to general anesthesia induction.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n====Elimination====\nFollowing distribution into the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), the anesthetic drug then diffuses out of the CNS into the muscles and viscera, followed by [[adipose tissue]]s. In patients given a single injection of drug, this redistribution results in termination of general anesthesia. Therefore, following administration of a single anesthetic [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]], duration of drug effect is dependent solely upon the redistribution kinetics.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nThe [[half-life]] of an anesthetic drug following a prolonged infusion, however, depends upon both drug redistribution kinetics, [[drug metabolism]] in the liver, and existing drug concentration in fat. When large quantities of an anesthetic drug have already been dissolved in the body's fat stores, this can slow its redistribution out of the brain and spinal cord, prolonging its CNS effects. For this reason, the half-lives of these infused drugs are said to be [[Context-sensitive half-life|context-dependent]]. Generally, prolonged anesthetic drug infusions result in longer drug half-lives, slowed elimination from the brain and spinal cord, and delayed termination of general anesthesia.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n=== Inhalational general anesthetics ===\n[[Minimum alveolar concentration|Minimal alveolar concentration (MAC)]] is the concentration of an inhalational anesthetic in the lungs that prevents 50% of patients from responding to surgical incision. This value is used to compare the [[Potency (pharmacology)|potencies]] of various inhalational general anesthetics and impacts the [[Partial pressure|partial-pressure]] of the drug utilized by healthcare providers during general anesthesia induction and/or maintenance.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":25\" />\n\n==== Induction ====\n[[File:General_Anesthesia_WIKI_-_Figure.tif|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:General_Anesthesia_WIKI_-_Figure.tif|thumb|437x437px]]\nInduction of anesthesia is facilitated by diffusion of an inhaled anesthetic drug into the brain and spinal cord. Diffusion throughout the body proceeds until the drug's [[partial pressure]] within the various tissues is equivalent to the partial pressure of the drug within the lungs.<ref name=\":16\" /> Healthcare providers can control the rate of anesthesia induction and final tissue concentrations of the anesthetic by varying the partial pressure of the inspired anesthetic. A higher drug partial pressure in the lungs will drive diffusion more rapidly throughout the body and yield a higher maximum tissue concentration. Respiratory rate and inspiratory volume will also effect the promptness of anesthesia onset, as will the extent of pulmonary blood flow.<ref name=\":25\" />\n\nThe [[partition coefficient]] of a gaseous drug is indicative of its relative solubility in various tissues. This metric is the relative drug concentration between two tissues, when their partial pressures are equal (gas:blood, fat:blood, etc.). Inhalational anesthetics vary widely with respect to their tissue solubilities and partition coefficients.<ref name=\":16\" /> Anesthetics that are highly soluble require many molecules of drug to raise the partial pressure within a given tissue, as opposed to minimally soluble anesthetics which require relatively few.<ref name=\":25\" /> Generally, inhalational anesthetics that are minimally soluble reach equilibrium more quickly. Inhalational anesthetics that have a high fat:blood partition coefficient, however, reach equilibrium more slowly, due to the minimal vascularization of fat tissue, which serves as a large, slowly-filling reservoir for the drug.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n==== Elimination ====\nInhaled anesthetics are eliminated via expiration, following diffusion into the lungs. This process is dependent largely upon the anesthetic [[Blood\u2013gas partition coefficient|blood:gas partition coefficient]], tissue solubility, blood flow to the lungs, and patient respiratory rate and inspiratory volume.<ref name=\":25\" /> For gases that have minimal tissue solubility, termination of anesthesia generally occurs as rapidly as the onset of anesthesia. For gases that have high tissue solubility, however, termination of anesthesia is generally [[Context-sensitive half-life|context-dependent]]. As with intravenous anesthetic infusions, prolonged delivery of highly soluble anesthetic gases generally results in longer drug half-lives, slowed elimination from the brain and spinal cord, and delayed termination of anesthesia.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nMetabolism of inhaled anesthetics is generally not a major route of drug elimination.<ref name=\":25\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Local anesthesia|Local anaesthesia]]\n* [[Mechanical ventilation]]\n* [[Intraoperative awareness]]\n\n==References ==\n{{Reflist}}{{Anesthesia}}\n{{General anesthetics}}\n{{Major drug groups}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:General Anaesthetic}}\n[[Category:Drugs with unknown mechanisms of action]]\n[[Category:Anesthesia]]", "sha1": "b8wzj46svslv39o779sfnwv29csy419"}}, {"title": "Geoffrey Chaucer", "ns": "0", "id": "12787", "revision": {"id": "866579787", "parentid": "866072107", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T06:18:05Z", "contributor": {"ip": "142.160.89.97"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|Chaucer}}\n{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|English poet}}\n{{Infobox writer<!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n| name = Geoffrey Chaucer\n| image = File:Portrait of Geoffrey Chaucer (4671380) (cropped).jpg\n| caption = Portrait of Chaucer (19th century)\n| birth_date = {{circa|1343}}\n| birth_place = London, England\n| death_date = {{Death date|df=y|1400|10|25}} (aged 56\u201357)\n| resting_place = [[Westminster Abbey]], London\n| period = [[Late Middle Ages]]\n| occupation = Author, poet, philosopher, [[Bureaucracy|bureaucrat]], diplomat\n| spouse = [[Philippa Roet]]\n| children = {{Plainlist|\n*Elizabeth Chaucer\n*[[Thomas Chaucer]]\n }}\n}}\n\n'''Geoffrey Chaucer''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t\u0283|\u0254\u02d0|s|\u0259r}}; {{circa|1343}}&nbsp;\u2013 25 October 1400), known as the Father of [[English literature]],<ref>Robert DeMaria, Jr., Heesok Chang, Samantha Zacher (eds.), ''A Companion to British Literature, Volume 2: Early Modern Literature, 1450\u20131660'', John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p. 41.</ref> is widely considered the greatest English poet of the [[Middle Ages]].

He also worked as a courtier, a diplomat, and a civil servant, as well as working for the king from 1389 to 1391 as Clerk of the King's Works.<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = Critical Companion to Chaucer: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work\n | last1 = Rossignol | first1 = Rosalyn\n | publisher = Facts on File | location = New York\n | pages = 551, 613\n | date = 2006\n | isbn = 978-0-8160-6193-8\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1359, in the early stages of the [[Hundred Years' War]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] invaded France and Chaucer travelled with [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], Elizabeth's husband, as part of the [[History of the British Army|English army]]. In 1360, he was captured during the [[Reims Campaign|siege of Rheims]]. Edward paid \u00a316 for his ransom,<ref>''Chaucer Life Records'', p. 24</ref> a considerable sum, and Chaucer was released.\n\nAfter this, Chaucer's life is uncertain, but he seems to have travelled in France, Spain, and [[Flanders]], possibly as a messenger and perhaps even going on a pilgrimage to [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Around 1366, Chaucer married [[Philippa (de) Roet]]. She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III's queen, [[Philippa of Hainault]], and a sister of [[Katherine Swynford]], who later (c. 1396) became the third wife of [[John of Gaunt]]. It is uncertain how many children Chaucer and Philippa had, but three or four are most commonly cited. His son, [[Thomas Chaucer]], had an illustrious career, as [[Chief Butler of England|chief butler]] to four kings, envoy to France, and [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. Thomas's daughter, [[Alice de la Pole|Alice]], married the [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]].

He became a member of the royal court of Edward III as a ''[[valet de chambre]]'', [[yeoman]], or [[esquire]] on 20 June 1367, a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks. His wife also received a pension for court employment. He travelled abroad many times, at least some of them in his role as a valet. In 1368, he may have attended the wedding of [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]] to [[Violante Visconti]], daughter of [[Galeazzo II Visconti]], in [[Milan]]. Two other literary stars of the era were in attendance: [[Jean Froissart]] and [[Petrarch]]. Around this time, Chaucer is believed to have written ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' in honour of [[Blanche of Lancaster]], the late wife of John of Gaunt, who died in 1369 of the plague.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Holt Literature and Language Arts|last=|first=|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=2003|isbn=0030573742|location=|pages=113}}</ref>\n\nChaucer travelled to [[Picardy]] the next year as part of a military expedition; in 1373 he visited [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]].

Later documents suggest it was a mission, along with Jean Froissart, to arrange a marriage between the future King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and a French princess, thereby ending the [[Hundred Years War]]. If this was the purpose of their trip, they seem to have been unsuccessful, as no wedding occurred.\n\nIn 1378, Richard II sent Chaucer as an envoy (secret dispatch) to the Visconti and to Sir [[John Hawkwood]], English [[condottiere]] (mercenary leader) in [[Milan]]. It has been speculated that it was Hawkwood on whom Chaucer based his character the Knight in the ''Canterbury Tales'', for a description matches that of a 14th-century condottiere.\n\n[[File:Geoffrey Chaucer.jpeg|left|thumb|A 19th-century depiction of Chaucer]]\nA possible indication that his career as a writer was appreciated came when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] granted Chaucer \"a gallon of wine daily for the rest of his life\" for some unspecified task. This was an unusual grant, but given on a day of celebration, [[St George's Day]], 1374, when artistic endeavours were traditionally rewarded, it is assumed to have been another early poetic work. It is not known which, if any, of Chaucer's extant works prompted the reward, but the suggestion of him as poet to a king places him as a precursor to later [[poets laureate]]. Chaucer continued to collect the liquid stipend until Richard II came to power, after which it was converted to a monetary grant on 18 April 1378.\n\nChaucer obtained the very substantial job of [[comptroller]] of the customs for the port of London, which he began on 8 June 1374.<ref>Morley, Henry (1890) ''English Writers: an attempt towards a history of English literature''. London: Cassell & Co.; Vol. V. p. 106.</ref> He must have been suited for the role as he continued in it for twelve years, a long time in such a post at that time. His life goes undocumented for much of the next ten years, but it is believed that he wrote (or began) most of his famous works during this period. He was mentioned in law papers of 4 May 1380, involved in the ''raptus'' of Cecilia Chaumpaigne. What ''raptus'' means is unclear, but the incident seems to have been resolved quickly and did not leave a stain on Chaucer's reputation. It is not known if Chaucer was in the city of London at the time of the [[Peasants' Revolt]], but if he was, he would have seen its leaders pass almost directly under his apartment window at [[Aldgate]].<ref>Saunders, Corrine J. (2006) ''A Concise Companion to Chaucer''. Oxford: Blackwell; p. 19</ref>\n\nWhile still working as comptroller, Chaucer appears to have moved to [[Kent]], being appointed as one of the commissioners of peace for Kent, at a time when French invasion was a possibility. He is thought to have started work on ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the early 1380s. He also became a member of parliament for Kent in 1386, and attended the '[[Wonderful Parliament]]' that year. He appears to have been present at most of the 71 days it sat, for which he was paid \u00a324 9s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=F.

The last mention of Chaucer is on 5 June 1400, when some monies owed to him were paid.\n\nHe is believed to have died of unknown causes on 25 October 1400, but there is no firm evidence for this date, as it comes from the engraving on his tomb, erected more than one hundred years after his death. There is some speculation\u2014most recently in [[Terry Jones]]' book ''[[Who Murdered Chaucer? : A Medieval Mystery]]''\u2014that he was murdered by enemies of Richard II or even on the orders of his successor Henry IV, but the case is entirely circumstantial. Chaucer was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] in London, as was his right owing to his status as a tenant of the Abbey's close. In 1556, his remains were transferred to a more ornate tomb, making Chaucer the first writer interred in the area now known as [[Poets' Corner]].\n\n==Relationship to John of Gaunt==\nChaucer was a close friend of [[John of Gaunt]], the wealthy [[Duke of Lancaster]] (and father of the future [[Henry IV of England|King of England]]), and served under his patronage. Near the end of their lives Lancaster and Chaucer became brothers-in-law. Chaucer married [[Philippa (de) Roet|Philippa (Pan) de Roet]] in 1366, and Lancaster took his mistress of nearly 30 years, [[Katherine Swynford]] (de Roet), who was Philippa Chaucer's sister, as his third wife in 1396. Although Philippa died c.1387, the men were bound as brothers and Lancaster's children by Katherine\u2014John, Henry, Thomas and Joan [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]]\u2014were Chaucer's nephews and niece.\n\nChaucer's ''[[Book of the Duchess]]'', also known as the ''Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse'',<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = The Riverside Chaucer\n | last1 = Chaucer | first1 = Geoffrey\n | editor1-last = Benson | editor1-first = Larry D.\n | editor2-last = Pratt | editor2-first = Robert\n | editor3-last = Robinson | editor3-first = F.N.\n | year = 1984\n | chapter = The Legend of Good Women\n | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | location = Boston\n | page = 600\n | isbn = 0-395-29031-7\n}}</ref> <!-- DEETH, BLAUNCHE, & DUCHESSE are correct Middle English spellings, please do not change --> was written in commemoration of [[Blanche of Lancaster]], John of Gaunt's first wife. The poem refers to John and Blanche in [[allegory]] as the narrator relates the tale of \"A long castel with walles white/Be Seynt Johan, on a ryche hil\" (1318\u20131319) who is mourning grievously after the death of his love, \"And goode faire White she het/That was my lady name ryght\" (948\u2013949). The phrase \"long castel\" is a reference to Lancaster (also called \"Loncastel\" and \"Longcastell\"), \"walles white\" is thought to likely be an oblique reference to Blanche, \"Seynt Johan\" was John of Gaunt's name-saint, and \"ryche hil\" is a reference to Richmond; these thinly veiled references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. \"White\" is the English translation of the French word \"blanche\", implying that the white lady was [[Blanche of Lancaster]].<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = The Riverside Chaucer\n | last1 = Wilcockson | first1 = Colin\n | editor1-last = Benson | editor1-first = Larry D.\n | editor2-last = Pratt | editor2-first = Robert\n | editor3-last = Robinson | editor3-first = F.N.\n | year = 1987\n | chapter = Explanatory Notes on 'The Book of the Duchess'\n | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | location = Boston\n | pages = 966\u2013976\n | isbn = 0-395-29031-7\n}}</ref>\n\nBelieved to have been written in the 1390s, Chaucer's short poem ''Fortune'', is also inferred to directly reference Lancaster.<ref name=\"Gross, Zaila 1987 635\">{{Cite book\n | title = The Riverside Chaucer\n | last1 = Gross | first1 = Zaila\n | editor1-last = Benson | editor1-first = Larry D.\n | editor2-last = Pratt | editor2-first = Robert\n | editor3-last = Robinson | editor3-first = F.N.\n | year = 1987\n | chapter = Introduction to the Short Poems\n | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | location = Boston\n | page = 635\n | isbn = 0-395-29031-7\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n | title = A New View of Chaucer\n | last = Williams | first = George\n | year = 1965\n | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham\n | page = 55\n}}</ref> \"Chaucer as narrator\" openly defies [[Fortuna|''Fortune'']], proclaiming he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit, and declares \"my suffisaunce\" (15) and that \"over himself hath the maystrye\" (14). [[Fortuna|''Fortune'']], in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, \"And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve\" (32, 40, 48). Chaucer retorts that \"My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse\" (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. [[Fortuna|''Fortune'']] turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and \"Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne\" (78\u201379). The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|York]], and [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]], and a portion of line 76, \"as three of you or tweyne,\" to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes.<ref name=\"Gross, Zaila 1987 635\" /> Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's \"beste frend\". [[Fortuna|''Fortune'']] states three times in her response to the plaintiff, \"And also, you still have your best friend alive\" (32, 40, 48); she also references his \"beste frend\" in the envoy when appealing to his \"noblesse\" to help Chaucer to a higher estate. A fifth reference is made by \"Chaucer as narrator\" who rails at [[Fortuna|''Fortune'']] that she shall not take his friend from him. While the envoy playfully hints to Lancaster that Chaucer would certainly appreciate a boost to his status or income, the poem ''Fortune'' distinctively shows his deep appreciation and affection for John of Gaunt.\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nGeoffrey Chaucer's attitudes toward \"the Church\" should not be confused with his attitudes toward Christianity. Chaucer seems to have respected and admired sincere Christians (and to have been one himself), even while he also recognised that many people in the church of his era were venal and corrupt.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/was-chaucer-favor-church-opposed-326550|title=Was Chaucer in favor of the church or opposed to it?   \u2013 eNotes|website=eNotes}}</ref> In his \"retraction\" Chaucer writes \"now I beg all those that listen to this little treatise [Canterbury Tales], or read it, that if there be anything in it that pleases them, they thank our Lord Jesus Christ for it, from whom proceeds all understanding and goodness.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/poets/geoffrey-chaucer.html|title=Geoffrey Chaucer}}</ref>\n\n==Literary works==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}<!--first 3 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:Portrait of Chaucer - Portrait and Life of Chaucer (16th C), f.1 - BL Add MS 5141.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Chaucer (16th century), f.1 \u2013 BL Add MS 5141]]\n[[File:Hengwrt Chaucer (f.2.r) title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, possibly in the hand of the scribe [[Adam Pinkhurst]], c. 1400]]\nChaucer's first major work, ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'', was an elegy for [[Blanche of Lancaster]] (who died in 1368). It is possible that this work was commissioned by her husband John of Gaunt, as he granted Chaucer a \u00a310 annuity on 13 June 1374. This would seem to place the writing of ''The Book of the Duchess'' between the years 1368 and 1374. Two other early works by Chaucer were ''[[Anelida and Arcite]]'' and ''[[The House of Fame]]''. Chaucer wrote many of his major works in a prolific period when he held the job of customs comptroller for London (1374 to 1386). His ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'', ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' all date from this time. It is believed that in the early 1380s he started the work for which he is best known \u2013 ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', a collection of stories told by fictional pilgrims on the road to the cathedral at [[Canterbury]]; tales that would help to shape English literature.\n\n''The Canterbury Tales'' contrasts with other literature of the period in the naturalism of its narrative, the variety of stories the pilgrims tell and the varied characters who are engaged in the pilgrimage. Many of the stories narrated by the pilgrims seem to fit their individual characters and social standing, although some of the stories seem ill-fitting to their narrators, perhaps as a result of the incomplete state of the work. Chaucer drew on real life for his cast of pilgrims: the innkeeper shares the name of a contemporary keeper of an inn in Southwark, and real-life identities for the Wife of Bath, the Merchant, the Man of Law and the Student have been suggested. The many jobs that Chaucer held in medieval society\u2014page, soldier, messenger, valet, bureaucrat, foreman and administrator\u2014probably exposed him to many of the types of people he depicted in the ''Tales''. He was able to shape their speech and satirise their manners in what was to become popular literature among people of the same types.\n\nChaucer's works are sometimes grouped into first a French period, then an Italian period and finally an English period, with Chaucer being influenced by those countries' literatures in turn. Certainly ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' is a middle period work with its reliance on the forms of Italian poetry, little known in England at the time, but to which Chaucer was probably exposed during his frequent trips abroad on court business. In addition, its use of a [[Classical antiquity|classical]] subject and its elaborate, courtly language sets it apart as one of his most complete and well-formed works. In ''Troilus and Criseyde'' Chaucer draws heavily on his source, [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], and on the late Latin philosopher [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]. However, it is ''The Canterbury Tales'', wherein he focuses on English subjects, with bawdy jokes and respected figures often being undercut with humour, that has cemented his reputation.\n\nChaucer also translated such important works as Boethius' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' and ''[[Roman de la Rose|The Romance of the Rose]]'' by [[Guillaume de Lorris]] (extended by Jean de Meun). However, while many scholars maintain that Chaucer did indeed translate part of the text of ''Roman de la Rose'' as ''[[The Romaunt of the Rose]]'', others claim that this has been effectively disproved. Many of his other works were very loose translations of, or simply based on, works from continental Europe. It is in this role that Chaucer receives some of his earliest critical praise. [[Eustache Deschamps]] wrote a ballade on the great translator and called himself a \"nettle in Chaucer's garden of poetry\". In 1385 [[Thomas Usk]] made glowing mention of Chaucer, and [[John Gower]], Chaucer's main poetic rival of the time, also lauded him. This reference was later edited out of Gower's ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' and it was suggested by one editor<ref>{{ cite book\n | title=The Canterbury Tales of Chaucer | editor=Thomas Tyrwhitt\n | chapter=Introductory Discourse to the Canterbury Tales | page=126 note 15\n | publisher=W.

Although much of the text may have come from other sources, the treatise indicates that Chaucer was versed in science in addition to his literary talents. Another scientific work discovered in 1952, ''Equatorie of the Planetis'', has language and handwriting similar to some considered to be Chaucer's and it continues many of the ideas from the Astrolabe. Furthermore, it contains an example of early European [[encryption]].<ref>[[Simon Singh]]: ''[[The Code Book]]'', page 27. Fourth Estate, 1999</ref> The attribution of this work to Chaucer is still uncertain.\n\n==Influence==\n===Linguistic===\n[[File:Chaucer Hoccleve.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Portrait of Chaucer from a manuscript by [[Thomas Hoccleve]], who may have met Chaucer]]\nChaucer wrote in continental accentual-syllabic [[Meter (poetry)|meter]], a style which had developed since around the 12th century as an alternative to the [[Alliterative verse|alliterative]] Anglo-Saxon metre.<ref>C. B. McCully and J. J. Anderson, ''English Historical Metrics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 97.</ref> Chaucer is known for metrical innovation, inventing the [[rhyme royal]], and he was one of the first English poets to use the five-stress line, a decasyllabic cousin to the [[iambic pentameter]], in his work, with only a few anonymous short works using it before him.<ref>[[Marchette Chute]], ''Geoffrey Chaucer of England'' E. P. Dutton, 1946, p. 89.</ref> The arrangement of these five-stress lines into rhyming [[couplet]]s, first seen in his ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', was used in much of his later work and became one of the standard poetic forms in English. His early influence as a satirist is also important, with the common humorous device, the funny accent of a regional [[dialect]], apparently making its first appearance in ''[[The Reeve's Tale]]''.\n\nThe poetry of Chaucer, along with other writers of the era, is credited with helping to standardise the London Dialect of the [[Middle English]] language from a combination of the Kentish and Midlands dialects.<ref>Edwin Winfield Bowen, ''Questions at Issue in our English Speech'', NY: Broadway Publishing, 1909, p. 147.</ref> This is probably overstated; the influence of the court, [[Lord Chancellor|chancery]] and bureaucracy\u2014of which Chaucer was a part\u2014remains a more probable influence on the development of [[Standard English]]. [[Modern English]] is somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucer's poems owing to the effect of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] some time after his death. This change in the [[pronunciation]] of English, still not fully understood, makes the reading of Chaucer difficult for the modern audience. The status of the final ''-e'' in Chaucer's verse is uncertain: it seems likely that during the period of Chaucer's writing the final ''-e'' was dropping out of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular. Chaucer's versification suggests that the final ''-e'' is sometimes to be vocalised, and sometimes to be silent; however, this remains a point on which there is disagreement. When it is vocalised, most scholars pronounce it as a [[schwa]]. Apart from the irregular spelling, much of the vocabulary is recognisable to the modern reader. Chaucer is also recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as the first author to use many common English words in his writings. These words were probably frequently used in the language at the time but Chaucer, with his ear for common speech, is the earliest extant manuscript source. ''Acceptable'', ''alkali'', ''altercation'', ''amble'', ''angrily'', ''annex'', ''annoyance'', ''approaching'', ''arbitration'', ''armless'', ''army'', ''arrogant'', ''arsenic'', ''arc'', ''artillery'' and ''aspect'' are just some of the many [[English words first attested in Chaucer]].\n\n===Literary===\nWidespread knowledge of Chaucer's works is attested by the many poets who imitated or responded to his writing. [[John Lydgate]] was one of the earliest poets to write continuations of Chaucer's unfinished ''Tales'' while [[Robert Henryson]]'s ''Testament of Cresseid'' completes the story of [[Cressida]] left unfinished in his ''Troilus and Criseyde''. Many of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works contain material from these poets and later appreciations by the [[romantic era]] poets were shaped by their failure to distinguish the later \"additions\" from original Chaucer. Writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as [[John Dryden]], admired Chaucer for his stories, but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers, leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess.<ref>\"From The Preface to ''Fables Ancient and Modern''\".

New York, London: Norton, 2006. 2132\u201333. p. 2132.</ref> It was not until the late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon, accepted today, was decided upon, largely as a result of [[Walter William Skeat]]'s work. Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer's death, ''The Canterbury Tales'' was selected by [[William Caxton]] to be one of the first books to be printed in England.\n\n===English===\nChaucer is sometimes considered the source of the English vernacular tradition. His achievement for the language can be seen as part of a general historical trend towards the creation of a [[vernacular literature]], after the example of [[Dante]], in many parts of Europe. A parallel trend in Chaucer's own lifetime was underway in Scotland through the work of his slightly earlier contemporary, [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]], and was likely to have been even more general, as is evidenced by the example of the [[Pearl Poet]] in the north of England.\n\nAlthough Chaucer's language is much closer to Modern English than the text of ''[[Beowulf]]'', such that (unlike that of ''Beowulf'') a Modern English-speaker with a large vocabulary of archaic words may understand it, it differs enough that most publications modernise his idiom. The following is a sample from the prologue of ''[[The Summoner's Tale]]'' that compares Chaucer's text to a modern translation:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n| || ''Original Text'' || ''Modern Translation''\n|-\n| || This frere bosteth that he knoweth helle,\n| This friar boasts that he knows hell,\n|-\n| || And God it woot, that it is litel wonder;\n| And God knows that it is little wonder;\n|-\n| || Freres and feendes been but lyte asonder.\n| Friars and fiends are seldom far apart.\n|-\n| || For, pardee, ye han ofte tyme herd telle\n| For, by God, you have ofttimes heard tell\n|-\n|  || How that a frere ravyshed was to helle\n| How a friar was taken to hell\n|-\n| || In spirit ones by a visioun;\n| In spirit, once by a vision;\n|-\n| || And as an angel ladde hym up and doun,\n| And as an angel led him up and down,\n|-\n|  || To shewen hym the peynes that the were,\n| To show him the pains that were there,\n|-\n| || In al the place saugh he nat a frere;\n| In all the place he saw not a friar;\n|-\n| || Of oother folk he saugh ynowe in wo.\n| Of other folk he saw enough in woe.\n|-\n|  || Unto this angel spak the frere tho:\n| Unto this angel spoke the friar thus:\n|-\n| || Now, sire, quod he, han freres swich a grace\n| \"Now sir\", said he, \"Have friars such a grace\n|-\n| || That noon of hem shal come to this place?\n| That none of them come to this place?\"\n|-\n| || Yis, quod this aungel, many a millioun!\n| \"Yes\", said the angel, \"many a million!\"\n|-\n| || And unto sathanas he ladde hym doun.\n| And unto Satan the angel led him down.\n|-\n| || \u2013And now hath sathanas, \u2013seith he, \u2013a tayl\n| \"And now Satan has\", he said, \"a tail,\n|-\n|  || Brodder than of a carryk is the sayl.\n| Broader than a galleon's sail.\n|-\n| || Hold up thy tayl, thou sathanas!\u2013quod he;\n| Hold up your tail, Satan!\" said he.\n|-\n| || \u2013shewe forth thyn ers, and lat the frere se\n| \"Show forth your arse, and let the friar see\n|-\n| || Where is the nest of freres in this place!\u2013\n| Where the nest of friars is in this place!\"\n|-\n| || And er that half a furlong wey of space,\n| And before half a furlong of space,\n|-\n| || Right so as bees out swarmen from an hyve,\n| Just as bees swarm out from a hive,\n|-\n| ||Out of the develes ers ther gonne dryve\n| Out of the devil's arse there were driven\n|-\n| || Twenty thousand freres on a route,\n| Twenty thousand friars on a rout,\n|-\n| || And thurghout helle swarmed al aboute,\n| And throughout hell swarmed all about,\n|-\n| || And comen agayn as faste as they may gon,\n| And came again as fast as they could go,\n|-\n| || And in his ers they crepten everychon.\n| And every one crept into his arse.\n|-\n|  ||He clapte his tayl agayn and lay ful stille.\n| He shut his tail again and lay very still.<ref>Original e-text available online at the [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Cha2Can.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&tag=public&part=17&division=div2 University of Virginia website], trans.

There are 83 surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales (in whole or part) alone, along with sixteen of ''Troilus and Criseyde'', including the personal copy of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].<ref>Benson, Larry, ''The Riverside Chaucer'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987), p. 1118.</ref> Given the ravages of time, it is likely that these surviving manuscripts represent hundreds since lost. Chaucer's original audience was a courtly one, and would have included women as well as men of the upper social classes. Yet even before his death in 1400, Chaucer's audience had begun to include members of the rising literate, middle and merchant classes, which included many [[Lollard]] sympathisers who may well have been inclined to read Chaucer as one of their own, particularly in his satirical writings about friars, priests, and other church officials. In 1464, John Baron, a tenant farmer in [[Agmondesham]], was brought before [[John Chadworth]], the Bishop of Lincoln, on charges he was a Lollard heretic; he confessed to owning a \"boke of the Tales of Caunterburie\" among other suspect volumes.<ref>Potter, Russell A., \"Chaucer and the Authority of Language: The Politics and Poetics of the Vernacular in Late Medieval England\", ''Assays'' VI (Carnegie-Mellon Press, 1991), p. 91.</ref>\n\n===Printed editions===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[William Caxton]], the first English printer, was responsible for the first two folio editions of ''The Canterbury Tales'' which were published in 1478 and 1483.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076.htm|title=A Leaf from The Canterbury Tales.

Both Caxton editions carry the equivalent of manuscript authority. Caxton's edition was reprinted by his successor, [[Wynkyn de Worde]], but this edition has no independent authority.\n\n[[Richard Pynson]], the [[King's Printer]] under Henry VIII for about twenty years, was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer, introducing in the process five previously printed texts that we now know are not Chaucer's. (The collection is actually three separately printed texts, or collections of texts, bound together as one volume.) There is a likely connection between Pynson's product and [[William Thynne]]'s a mere six years later. Thynne had a successful career from the 1520s until his death in 1546, when he was one of the masters of the royal household. His editions of ''Chaucers Works'' in 1532 and 1542 were the first major contributions to the existence of a widely recognised Chaucerian canon. Thynne represents his edition as a book sponsored by and supportive of the king who is praised in the preface by [[Sir Brian Tuke]]. Thynne's canon brought the number of apocryphal works associated with Chaucer to a total of 28, even if that was not his intention. As with Pynson, once included in the ''Works'', [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]] texts stayed within it, regardless of their first editor's intentions.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, Chaucer was printed more than any other English author, and he was the first author to have his works collected in comprehensive single-volume editions in which a Chaucer [[wikt:canon|canon]] began to cohere. Some scholars contend that 16th-century editions of Chaucer's ''Works'' set the precedent for all other English authors in terms of presentation, prestige and success in print. These editions certainly established Chaucer's reputation, but they also began the complicated process of reconstructing and frequently inventing Chaucer's biography and the canonical list of works which were attributed to him.\n\nProbably the most significant aspect of the growing apocrypha is that, beginning with Thynne's editions, it began to include medieval texts that made Chaucer appear as a [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]] [[Lollard]], primarily the ''[[Testament of Love]]'' and ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]''. As \"Chaucerian\" works that were not considered apocryphal until the late 19th century, these medieval texts enjoyed a new life, with English Protestants carrying on the earlier Lollard project of appropriating existing texts and authors who seemed sympathetic\u2014or malleable enough to be construed as sympathetic\u2014to their cause. The official Chaucer of the early printed volumes of his ''Works'' was construed as a proto-Protestant as the same was done, concurrently, with [[William Langland]] and ''[[Piers Plowman]]''. The famous ''Plowman's Tale'' did not enter Thynne's ''Works'' until the second, 1542, edition. Its entry was surely facilitated by Thynne's inclusion of [[Thomas Usk]]'s ''Testament of Love'' in the first edition. The ''Testament of Love'' imitates, borrows from, and thus resembles Usk's contemporary, Chaucer. (''Testament of Love'' also appears to borrow from ''Piers Plowman''.) Since the ''Testament of Love'' mentions its author's part in a failed plot (book 1, chapter 6), his imprisonment, and (perhaps) a recantation of (possibly Lollard) heresy, all this was associated with Chaucer. (Usk himself was executed as a traitor in 1388.) [[John Foxe]] took this recantation of heresy as a defence of the true faith, calling Chaucer a \"right Wiclevian\" and (erroneously) identifying him as a schoolmate and close friend of [[John Wycliffe]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]]. ([[Thomas Speght]] is careful to highlight these facts in his editions and his \"Life of Chaucer.\") No other sources for the ''Testament of Love'' exist\u2014there is only Thynne's construction of whatever manuscript sources he had.\n\n[[John Stow]] (1525\u20131605) was an antiquarian and also a chronicler.\nHis edition of Chaucer's ''Works'' in 1561<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm|title=UWM.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111220719/http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm|archivedate=11 November 2005}}</ref> brought the apocrypha to more than 50 titles.

What was added to Chaucer often helped represent him favourably to Protestant England.\n\n[[File:Chaucer 1602.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Chaucer from [[Thomas Speght|Speght's]] edition]]\n\nIn his 1598 edition of the ''Works'', Speght (probably taking cues from Foxe) made good use of Usk's account of his political intrigue and imprisonment in the ''Testament of Love'' to assemble a largely fictional \"Life of Our Learned English Poet, Geffrey Chaucer.\" Speght's \"Life\" presents readers with an erstwhile radical in troubled times much like their own, a proto-Protestant who eventually came around the king's views on religion. Speght states that \"In the second year of Richard the second, the King tooke Geffrey Chaucer and his lands into his protection. The occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people.\" Under the discussion of Chaucer's friends, namely John of Gaunt, Speght further explains:\n\n::Yet it seemeth that [Chaucer] was in some trouble in the daies of King Richard the second, as it may appeare in the Testament of Loue: where hee doth greatly complaine of his owne rashnesse in following the multitude, and of their hatred against him for bewraying their purpose. And in that complaint which he maketh to his empty purse, I do find a written copy, which I had of Iohn Stow (whose library hath helped many writers) wherein ten times more is adioined, then is in print. Where he maketh great lamentation for his wrongfull imprisonment, wishing death to end his daies: which in my iudgement doth greatly accord with that in the Testament of Loue. Moreouer we find it thus in Record.\n\nLater, in \"The [[Argument (literature)|Argument]]\" to the ''Testament of Love'', Speght adds:\n::Chaucer did compile this booke as a comfort to himselfe after great griefs conceiued for some rash attempts of the commons, with whome he had ioyned, and thereby was in feare to loose the fauour of his best friends.\n\nSpeght is also the source of the famous tale of Chaucer being fined for beating a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] in [[Fleet Street]], as well as a fictitious [[coat of arms]] and [[family tree]]. Ironically\u2014and perhaps consciously so\u2014an introductory, apologetic letter in Speght's edition from [[Francis Beaumont]] defends the unseemly, \"low\", and bawdy bits in Chaucer from an elite, classicist position. Francis Thynne noted some of these inconsistencies in his ''Animadversions'', insisting that Chaucer was not a commoner, and he objected to the friar-beating story. Yet Thynne himself underscores Chaucer's support for popular religious reform, associating Chaucer's views with his father William Thynne's attempts to include ''The Plowman's Tale'' and ''The Pilgrim's Tale'' in the 1532 and 1542 ''Works''.\n\nThe myth of the Protestant Chaucer continues to have a lasting impact on a large body of Chaucerian scholarship. Though it is extremely rare for a modern scholar to suggest Chaucer supported a religious movement that didn't exist until more than a century after his death, the predominance of this thinking for so many centuries left it for granted that Chaucer was at least hostile toward Catholicism. This assumption forms a large part of many critical approaches to Chaucer's works, including neo-Marxism.\n\nAlongside Chaucer's ''Works'', the most impressive literary monument of the period is [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Acts and Monuments...]]''. As with the Chaucer editions, it was critically significant to English Protestant identity and included Chaucer in its project. Foxe's Chaucer both derived from and contributed to the printed editions of Chaucer's ''Works'', particularly the pseudepigrapha. ''Jack Upland'' was first printed in Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', and then it appeared in Speght's edition of Chaucer's ''Works''. Speght's \"Life of Chaucer\" echoes Foxe's own account, which is itself dependent upon the earlier editions that added the ''Testament of Love'' and ''The Plowman's Tale'' to their pages. Like Speght's Chaucer, Foxe's Chaucer was also a shrewd (or lucky) political survivor. In his 1563 edition, Foxe \"thought it not out of season \u2026 to couple \u2026 some mention of Geoffrey Chaucer\" with a discussion of [[John Colet]], a possible source for [[John Skelton]]'s character [[Colin Clout]].\n\nProbably referring to the 1542 [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]], Foxe said that he \"marvel[s] to consider \u2026 how the bishops, condemning and abolishing all manner of English books and treatises which might bring the people to any light of knowledge, did yet authorise the works of Chaucer to remain still and to be occupied; who, no doubt, saw into religion as much almost as even we do now, and uttereth in his works no less, and seemeth to be a right Wicklevian, or else there never was any. And that, all his works almost, if they be thoroughly advised, will testify (albeit done in mirth, and covertly); and especially the latter end of his third book of the Testament of Love \u2026 Wherein, except a man be altogether blind, he may espy him at the full: although in the same book (as in all others he useth to do), under shadows covertly, as under a visor, he suborneth truth in such sort, as both privily she may profit the godly-minded, and yet not be espied of the crafty adversary. And therefore the bishops, belike, taking his works but for jests and toys, in condemning other books, yet permitted his books to be read.\"\n\nIt is significant, too, that Foxe's discussion of Chaucer leads into his history of \"The Reformation of the Church of Christ in the Time of Martin Luther\" when \"Printing, being opened, incontinently ministered unto the church the instruments and tools of learning and knowledge; which were good books and authors, which before lay hid and unknown. The science of printing being found, immediately followed the grace of God; which stirred up good wits aptly to conceive the light of knowledge and judgment: by which light darkness began to be espied, and ignorance to be detected; truth from error, religion from superstition, to be discerned.\"\n\nFoxe downplays Chaucer's bawdy and amorous writing, insisting that it all testifies to his piety. Material that is troubling is deemed metaphoric, while the more forthright satire (which Foxe prefers) is taken literally.\n[[File:Chaucer1721.jpg|thumb|left|Spine and Titlepage of the 1721 [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry edition]] of Chaucer's complete works]]\n\n[[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]] produced the first edition of the complete works of Chaucer in a Latin font, published posthumously in 1721. Included were several tales, according to the editors, for the first time printed, a biography of Chaucer, a glossary of old English words, and testimonials of author writers concerning Chaucer dating back to the 16th century. According to A. S. G Edwards, \"This was the first collected edition of Chaucer to be printed in roman type. The life of Chaucer prefixed to the volume was the work of the Reverend [[John Dart]], corrected and revised by Timothy Thomas. The glossary appended was also mainly compiled by Thomas. The text of Urry's edition has often been criticised by subsequent editors for its frequent conjectural emendations, mainly to make it conform to his sense of Chaucer's metre. The justice of such criticisms should not obscure his achievement. His is the first edition of Chaucer for nearly a hundred and fifty years to consult any manuscripts and is the first since that of William Thynne in 1534 to seek systematically to assemble a substantial number of manuscripts to establish his text. It is also the first edition to offer descriptions of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works, and the first to print texts of 'Gamelyn' and 'The Tale of Beryn', works ascribed to, but not by, Chaucer.\"\n\n===Modern scholarship===\nAlthough Chaucer's works had long been admired, serious scholarly work on his legacy did not begin until the late 18th century, when [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] edited ''The Canterbury Tales'', and it did not become an established academic discipline until the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = Chaucer: The Critical Heritage.

[[Walter William Skeat]], who like Furnivall was closely associated with the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', established the base text of all of Chaucer's works with his edition, published by Oxford University Press. Later editions by John H. Fisher and Larry D. Benson offered further refinements, along with critical commentary and bibliographies.\n\nWith the textual issues largely addressed, if not resolved, attention turned to the questions of Chaucer's themes, structure, and audience.

He was instrumental in bringing the [[Modern Paganism|Contemporary Pagan]] religion of Wicca to public attention, writing some of its definitive religious texts and founding the tradition of [[Gardnerian Wicca]].\n\nBorn into an upper-middle-class family in [[Blundellsands]], [[Lancashire]], Gardner spent much of his childhood abroad in [[Madeira]]. In 1900, he moved to colonial [[Ceylon]], and then in 1911 to [[British Malaya|Malaya]], where he worked as a civil servant, independently developing an interest in the native peoples and writing papers and a book about their magical practices. After his retirement in 1936, he travelled to [[Cyprus]], penning the novel ''A Goddess Arrives'' before returning to England.  Settling down near the [[New Forest]], he joined an [[occultism|occult]] group, the [[Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship]], through which he said he had encountered the [[New Forest coven]] into which he was initiated in 1939. Believing the coven to be a survival of the pre-Christian [[Witch-cult hypothesis|witch-cult]] discussed in the works of [[Margaret Murray]], he decided to revive the faith, supplementing the coven's rituals with ideas borrowed from [[Freemasonry]], [[ceremonial magic]] and the writings of [[Aleister Crowley]] to form the Gardnerian tradition of Wicca.\n\nMoving to London in 1945, he became intent on propagating this religion, attracting media attention and writing about it in ''High Magic's Aid'' (1949), ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959). Founding a Wiccan group known as the [[Bricket Wood coven]], he introduced a string of High Priestesses into the religion, including [[Doreen Valiente]], [[Lois Bourne]], [[Patricia Crowther (Wiccan)|Patricia Crowther]] and [[Eleanor Bone]], through which the Gardnerian community spread throughout Britain and subsequently into Australia and the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Involved for a time with [[Cecil Williamson]], Gardner also became director of the [[Museum of Witchcraft|Museum of Magic and Witchcraft]] on the [[Isle of Man]], which he ran until his death.\n\nGardner is internationally recognised as the \"Father of Wicca\" among the Pagan and occult communities. His claims regarding the New Forest coven have been widely scrutinised, with Gardner being the subject of investigation for historians and biographers [[Aidan Kelly]], [[Ronald Hutton]] and [[Philip Heselton]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: 1884\u201399===\nGardner's family was wealthy and [[upper middle class]], running a family firm, Joseph Gardner and Sons, which described itself as \"the oldest private company in the timber trade within the [[British Empire]].\" Specialising in the import of [[hardwood]], the company had been founded in the mid-18th century by Edmund Gardner (b. 1721), an entrepreneur who would subsequently become a [[Freedom of the City|Freeman]] of [[Liverpool]].{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=6\u20139}}  Gerald's father, William Robert Gardner (1844\u20131935) had been the youngest son of Joseph Gardner (b. 1791), after whom the firm had been renamed, and who with his wife Maria had had five sons and three daughters. In 1867, William had been sent to [[New York City]], in order to further the interests of the family firm. Here, he had met an American, Louise Burguelew Ennis, the daughter of a wholesale stationer; entering a relationship, they were married in [[Manhattan]] on 25 November 1868. After a visit to England, the couple returned to the US, where they settled in [[Mott Haven]], [[Morrisania, Bronx|Morrisania]] in New York State.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=11\u201318}}  It was here that their first child, Harold Ennis Gardner, was born in 1870. At some point in the next two years they moved back to England, by 1873 settling into The Glen, a large Victorian house in [[Blundellsands]] in [[Lancashire]], north-west England, which was developing into a wealthy suburb of Liverpool. It was here that their second child, Robert \"Bob\" Marshall Gardner, was born in 1874.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=18\u201319, 23}}\n\n[[File:Gardner and Com.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Gardner with his Irish nursemaid, Com, during the 1880s]]\nIn 1876 the family moved into one of the neighbouring houses, Ingle Lodge, and it was here that the couple's third son, Gerald Brosseau Gardner, was born on Friday 13 June 1884.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=13|Heselton|2012a|2p=28}}  A fourth child, Francis Douglas Gardner, was then born in 1886.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=29}}  Gerald would rarely see Harold, who went on to study Law at the [[University of Oxford]], but saw more of Bob, who drew pictures for him, and Douglas, with whom he shared his nursery.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=13|Heselton|2012a|2p=29}} The Gardners employed an [[Irish people|Irish]] nursemaid named Josephine \"Com\" McCombie, who was entrusted with taking care of the young Gerald; she would subsequently become the dominant figure of his childhood, spending far more time with him than his parents.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=14|Heselton|2012a|2pp=29\u201331}} Gardner suffered with [[asthma]] from a young age, having particular difficulty in the cold Lancashire winters. His nursemaid offered to take him to warmer climates abroad at his father's expense in the hope that this condition would not be so badly affected.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=14|Heselton|2012a|2p=32}} Subsequently, in summer 1888, Gerald and Com travelled via London to [[Nice]] in the south of France.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=32\u201333}} After several more years spent in the [[Mediterranean]], in 1891 they went to the [[Canary Islands]], and it was here that Gardner first developed his lifelong interest in weaponry.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=15|Heselton|2012a|2pp=33\u201334}} From there, they then went on to [[Accra]] in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (modern [[Ghana]]).{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=17|Heselton|2012a|2pp=35\u201336}} Accra was followed by a visit to [[Funchal]] on the Portuguese colony of [[Madeira]]; they would spend most of the next nine years on the island, only returning to England for three or four months in the summer.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=18|Heselton|2012a|2p=36}}\n\nAccording to Gardner's first biographer, [[Jack Bracelin]], Com was very flirtatious and \"clearly looked on these trips as mainly manhunts\", viewing Gardner as a nuisance.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=17|Heselton|2012a|2pp=34\u201335}} As a result, he was largely left to his own devices, which he spent going out, meeting new people and learning about foreign cultures.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=39}} In Madeira, he also began collecting weapons, many of which were remnants from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], displaying them on the wall of his hotel room.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=39\u201340}} As a result of his illness and these foreign trips, Gardner ultimately never attended school, or gained any formal education.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=31}} He taught himself to read by looking at copies of ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' but his writing betrayed his poor education all his life, with highly eccentric spelling and grammar.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=19|Heselton|2012a|2p=40}} A voracious reader, one of the books that most influenced him at the time was [[Florence Marryat]]'s ''There Is No Death'' (1891), a discussion of [[spiritualism]], and from which he gained a firm belief in the existence of an [[afterlife]].{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=19\u201320|Heselton|2012a|2pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===Ceylon and Borneo: 1900\u201311===\nIn 1900, Com married David Elkington, one of her many suitors who owned a tea plantation in the British colony of [[Ceylon]] (modern [[Sri Lanka]]).{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=20|Heselton|2012a|2pp=43\u201344}} It was agreed with the Gardners that Gerald would live with her on a tea plantation named Ladbroke Estate in [[Maskeliya]] district, where he could learn the [[Tea production in Sri Lanka|tea trade]].{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=22\u201323|Heselton|2012a|2pp=44, 46}} In 1901 Gardner and the Elkingtons lived briefly in a [[bungalow]] in [[Kandy]], where a neighbouring bungalow had just been vacated by the occultists [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett]].{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=47\u201348}} At his father's expense, Gardner trained as a \"creeper\", or trainee planter, learning all about the growing of tea; although he disliked the \"dreary endlessness\" of the work, he enjoyed being outdoors and near to the forests.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=26|Heselton|2012a|2pp=48\u201349}} He lived with the Elkingtons until 1904, when he moved into his own bungalow and began earning a living working on the Non Pareil tea estate below the [[Horton Plains National Park|Horton Plains]]. He spent much of his spare time hunting deer and trekking through the local forests, becoming acquainted with the Singhalese natives and taking a great interest in their [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] beliefs.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=27, 30|Heselton|2012a|2pp=50\u201352}} In December 1904, his parents and younger brother visited, with his father asking him to invest in a pioneering [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber]] plantation which Gardner was to manage; located near the village of Belihil Oya, it was known as the Atlanta Estate, but allowed him a great deal of leisure time.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=28\u201329|Heselton|2012a|2pp=52\u201353}} Exploring his interest in weaponry, in 1907 Gardner joined the [[Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps]], a local [[Military reserve force|volunteer force]] composed of European tea and rubber planters intent on protecting their interests from foreign aggression or domestic insurrection.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=34|Heselton|2012a|2pp=55\u201356}}\n\nIn 1907 Gardner returned to Britain for several months' leave, spending time with his family and joining the [[Legion of Frontiersmen]], a militia founded to repel the threat of German invasion.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=57\u201359}} During his visit, Gardner spent a lot of time with family relations known as the Sergenesons. Gardner became very friendly with this side of his family, whom his [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] parents avoided because they were [[Methodists]]. According to Gardner, the Surgenesons readily talked about the [[paranormal]] with him; the patriarch of the family, Ted Surgeneson, believed that [[fairy|fairies]] were living in his garden and would say \"I can often feel they're there, and sometimes I've seen them\", though he readily admitted the possibility that it was all in his imagination.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=121|Heselton|2012a|2pp=59\u201362}} It was from the Sergenesons that Gardner claimed to have discovered a family rumour that his grandfather, Joseph, had been a practising [[witch]], after being converted to the practice by his mistress.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=123|Heselton|2012a|2pp=62\u201366}} Another unconfirmed family belief repeated by Gardner was that a Scottish ancestor, Grissell Gairdner, had been [[witch-hunt|burned as a witch]] in [[Newburgh, Fife|Newburgh]] in 1610.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=3\u20134}}\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Ibu Dajak krijger uit Long Nawan Z. en O. afdeling Borneo. TMnr 60034031.jpg|thumb|left|While working in Borneo in 1911, Gardner eschewed the racist attitudes of his colleagues by befriending members of the Dayak indigenous community, fascinated by their magico-religious beliefs, tattoos and displays of weaponry.]]\nGardner returned to Ceylon in late 1907 and settled down to the routine of managing the rubber plantation. In 1910 he was initiated as an [[Freemasonry|Apprentice Freemason]] into the Sphinx Lodge No. 107 in [[Colombo]], affiliated with the [[Grand Lodge of Ireland|Irish Grand Lodge]]. Gardner placed great importance on this new activity; In order to attend masonic meetings, he had to arrange a weekend's leave, walk 15 miles to the nearest railway station in [[Haputale]], and then catch a train to the city. He entered into the second and third degrees of Freemasonry within the next month, but this enthusiasm seems also to have waned, and he resigned the next year, probably because he intended to leave Ceylon.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=35|Heselton|2012a|2pp=66\u201367}} The experiment with rubber growing at the Atlanta Estate had proved relatively unsuccessful, and Gardner's father decided to sell the property in 1911, leaving Gerald unemployed.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=36|Heselton|2012a|2pp=67\u201368}}\n\nThat year, Gardner moved to [[Borneo]], gaining employment as a rubber planter at the Mawo Estate at Membuket. However, he did not get on well with the plantation's manager, a [[racism|racist]] named R. J. Graham who had wanted to deforest the entire local area.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=38\u201339|Heselton|2012a|2pp=70\u201371}} Instead Gardner became friendly with many of the locals, including the [[Dayak people|Dyak]] and [[Dusun people]].{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=43|Heselton|2012a|2p=71}} An amateur anthropologist, Gardner was fascinated by the indigenous way of life, particularly the local forms of weaponry such as the ''[[Blowgun|sumpitan]]''.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=44|Heselton|2012a|2pp=72\u201373}} He was intrigued by the [[tattoo]]s of the Dayaks and pictures of him in later life show large snake or dragon tattoos on his forearms, presumably obtained at this time.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=72}} Taking a great interest in indigenous religious beliefs, Gardner told his first biographer that he had attended Dusun [[s\u00e9ance]]s or healing rituals.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=45\u201348|Heselton|2012a|2pp=74\u201376}} He was unhappy with the working conditions and the racist attitudes of his colleagues, and when he developed [[malaria]] he felt that this was the last straw; he left Borneo and moved to [[Singapore]], in what was then known as the [[Straits Settlements]], part of [[British Malaya]].{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=51|Heselton|2012a|2pp=76\u201377}}\n\n===Malaya and World War I: 1911\u201326===\nArriving in Singapore, he initially planned to return to Ceylon, but was offered a job working as an assistant on a rubber plantation in [[Perak]], northern Malaya, and decided to take it, working for the [[Borneo Company Limited|Borneo Company]].{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=56, 60\u201361|Heselton|2012a|2p=81}} Arriving in the area, he decided to supplement this income by purchasing his own estate, Bukit Katho, on which he could grow rubber; initially sized at 450 acres, Gardner purchased various pieces of adjacent land until it covered 600 acres.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=85}} Here, Gardner made friends with an American man known as Cornwall, who had converted to [[Islam]] and married a local Malay woman.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=57\u201360|Heselton|2012a|2pp=82\u201383}} Through Cornwall, Gardner was introduced to many locals, whom he soon befriended, including members of the [[Senoi]] and [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] peoples. Cornwall invited Gardner to make the ''[[Shahada]]'', the Muslim confession of faith, which he did; it allowed him to gain the trust of locals, although would he would never become a practising Muslim. Cornwall was however an unorthodox Muslim, and his interest in local peoples included their magical and spiritual beliefs, to which he also introduced Gardner, who took a particular interest in the ''[[kris]]'', a ritual knife with magical uses.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=83\u201384, 91\u201395}}\n\nIn 1915, Gardner again joined a local volunteer militia, the Malay States Volunteer Rifles. Although between 1914 and 1918 [[World War I]] was raging in Europe, its effects were little felt in Malaya, apart from the [[1915 Singapore Mutiny]].{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=63\u201364|Heselton|2012a|2pp=85\u201386}} Gardner was keen to do more towards the war effort and in 1916 once again returned to Britain. He attempted to join the [[British Navy]], but was turned down due to ill health.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=123|Heselton|2012a|2pp=86\u201387}} Unable to fight on the front lines, he began working as an orderly in the [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] (VAD) in the First Western General Hospital, [[Fazakerley]], located on the outskirts of Liverpool. He was working in the VAD when casualties came back from the [[Battle of the Somme]] and he was engaged in looking after patients and assisting in changing wound dressings. He soon had to give this up when his malaria returned, and so decided to return to Malaya in October 1916 because of the warmer climate.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=123\u2013124|Heselton|2012a|2pp=87\u201389}}\n\nHe continued to manage the rubber plantation but after the end of the war, commodity prices dropped and by 1921 it was difficult to make a profit.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=95}} He returned again to Britain, in what later biographer Philip Heselton speculated might have been an unsuccessful attempt to ask his father for money.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=95\u201396}} Returning to Malaya, Gardner found that the Borneo Company had sacked him, and he was forced to find work with the Public Works Department.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=64\u201365|Heselton|2012a|2p=96}} In September 1923 he successfully applied to the Office of Customs to become a government-inspector of rubber plantations, a job that involved a great amount of travelling around the country, something he enjoyed.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=65\u201366|Heselton|2012a|2pp=96\u201398}} After a brief but serious illness, the [[Johore]] government reassigned Gardner to an office in the Lands Office while he recovered, eventually being promoted to Principal Officer of Customs. In this capacity, he was made an Inspector of Rubber Shops, overseeing the regulation and sale of rubber in the country. In 1926 he was placed in charge of monitoring shops selling [[opium]], noting regular irregularities and a thriving illegal trade in the controlled substance; believing opium to be essentially harmless, there is evidence indicating that Gardner probably took many bribes in this position, earning himself a small fortune.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=66\u201374|Heselton|2012a|2pp=99\u2013102}}\n\n===Marriage and archaeology: 1927\u201336===\n\nGardner's mother had died in 1920, but he had not returned to Britain on that occasion.{{Sfn|Bracelin|1960|p=125}} However, in 1927 his father became very ill with [[dementia]], and Gardner decided to visit him. On his return to Britain, Gardner began to investigate [[spiritualism]] and [[mediumship]]. He soon had several encounters which he attributed to spirits of deceased family members. Continuing to visit Spiritualist churches and s\u00e9ances, he was highly critical of much of what he saw, although he encountered several mediums he considered genuine. One medium apparently made contact with a deceased cousin of Gardner's, an event which impressed him greatly. His first biographer Jack Bracelin reports that this was a watershed in Gardner's life, and that a previous academic interest in spiritualism and life after death thereafter became a matter of firm personal belief for him.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=125\u2013133|Heselton|2012a|2pp=104\u2013109}} The very same evening (28 July 1927) after Gardner had met this medium, he met the woman he was to marry; Dorothea Frances Rosedale, known as Donna, a relation of his sister-in-law Edith. He asked her to marry him the next day and she agreed. Because his leave was coming to an end very soon, they married quickly on 16 August at [[St Jude's Church, Kensington]], and then [[honeymoon]]ed in [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], before heading via France to Malaya.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=133\u2013137|Heselton|2012a|2pp=109\u2013114}}\n\nArriving in the country, the couple settled into a bungalow at Bukit Japon in [[Johore Bahru]].{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=117}} Here, he once more became involved in Freemasonry, joining the Johore Royal Lodge No. 3946, but had retired from it by April 1931.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=122}} Gardner also returned to his old interests in the anthropology of Malaya, witnessing the magical practices performed by the locals, and he readily accepted a belief in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{Sfn|Bracelin|1960|p=59}} During his time in Malaya, Gardner became increasingly interested in local customs, particularly those involved in [[folk magic]] and weapons. Gardner was not only interested in the anthropology of Malaya, but also in its archaeology. He began excavations at the city of Johore Lama, alone and in secret, as the local Sultan considered archaeologists little better than grave-robbers. Prior to Gardner's investigations, no serious archaeological excavation had occurred at the city, though he himself soon unearthed four miles of earthworks, and uncovered finds that included tombs, pottery, and porcelain dating from [[Ming China]].{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=102\u2013103|Heselton|2012a|2pp=118\u2013121}} He went on to begin further excavations at the royal cemetery of [[Kota Tinggi]], and the jungle city of Syong Penang.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=104|Heselton|2012a|2p=119}} His finds were displayed as an exhibit on the \"Early History of Johore\" at the [[National Museum of Singapore]], and several beads that he had discovered suggested that trade went on between the [[Roman Empire]] and the Malays, presumably, Gardner thought, via India.{{Sfn|Bracelin|1960|p=106}} He also found gold coins originating from [[Johore]] and he published [[academic paper]]s on both the beads and the coins.{{Sfnm|Gardner|1937|Gardner|1933}}\n\n[[File:Kris display.jpg|thumb|right|A selection of ''kris'' knives; Gardner took a great interest in such items, even authoring the definitive text on the subject, ''Keris and Other Malay Weapons'' (1936).]]\n\nBy the early 1930s Gardner's activities had moved from those exclusively of a civil servant, and he began to think of himself more as a folklorist, archaeologist and anthropologist.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=74|Heselton|2012a|2p=123}} He was encouraged in this by the director of the Raffles Museum (now the [[National Museum of Singapore]]) and by his election to Fellowship of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]] in 1936.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=123}} En route back to London in 1932 Gardner stopped off in [[Egypt]] and, armed with a letter of introduction, joined [[Flinders Petrie|Sir Flinders Petrie]] who was excavating the site of [[Tall al-Ajjul]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=137\u2013138|Heselton|2012a|2pp=124\u2013126}} Arriving in London in August 1932 he attended a conference on prehistory and protohistory at [[King's College London]], attending at least two lectures which described the cult of the [[Mother Goddess]].{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=126\u2013128}} He also befriended the archaeologist and practising Pagan [[Alexander Keiller (archaeologist)|Alexander Keiller]], known for his excavations at [[Avebury]], who would encourage Gardner to join in with the excavations at Hembury Hill in [[Devon]], also attended by [[Aileen Fox]] and [[Mary Leakey]].{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=139|Heselton|2012a|2pp=126, 128}}\n\nReturning to East Asia, he took a ship from Singapore to [[Saigon]] in [[French Indo-China]], from where he travelled to [[Phnom Penh]], visiting the [[Silver Pagoda, Phnom Penh|Silver Pagoda]]. He then took a train to [[Hangzhou]] in China, before continuing onto [[Shanghai]]; because of the ongoing [[Chinese Civil War]], the train did not stop throughout the entire journey, something that annoyed the passengers.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=130}} In 1935, Gardner attended the Second Congress for Prehistoric Research in the Far East in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], acquainting himself with several experts in the field.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=130\u2013132}} His main research interest lay in the Malay ''kris'' blade, which he unusually chose to spell \"keris\"; he eventually collected 400 examples and talked to natives about their magico-religious uses. Deciding to author a book on the subject, he wrote ''Keris and Other Malay Weapons'', being encouraged to do so by anthropologist friends; it would subsequently edited into a readable form by Betty Lumsden Milne and published by the Singapore-based Progressive Publishing Company in 1936.{{Sfnm|Gardner|1936|Heselton|2012a|2pp=133\u2013141}} It was well received by literary and academic circles in Malaya.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=140\u2013145}} In 1935, Gardner heard that his father had died, leaving him a bequest of \u00a33,000. This assurance of financial independence may have led him to consider retirement, and as he was due for a long leave in 1936 the Johore Civil Service allowed him to retire slightly early, in January 1936. Gardner wanted to stay in Malaya, but he conceded to his wife Donna, who insisted that they return to England.{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=142|Heselton|2012a|2p=139}}\n\n===Return to Europe: 1936\u201338===\nIn 1936, Gardner and Donna left Malaya and headed for Europe. She proceeded straight to London, renting them a flat at 26 Charing Cross Road.{{sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=152|Heselton|2012a|2p=150}} Gardner visited [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], becoming involved in the archaeological excavations run by J.L. Starkey at [[Lachish]]. Here he grew particularly interested in a temple containing statues to both the male [[Abrahamic God|deity of Judeo-Christian theology]] and the pagan goddess [[Ashtoreth]].{{sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=149|Heselton|2012a|2pp=149\u2013151}} From Palestine, Gardner went to [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], and Germany. He eventually reached England, but soon went on a visit to [[Denmark]] to attend a conference on weaponry at the [[Christiansborg Palace]], [[Copenhagen]], during which he gave a talk on the ''kris''.{{sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=150\u2013152|Heselton|2012a|2pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nReturning to Britain, he found that the climate made him sick, leading him to register with a doctor, Edward A.Gregg, who recommended that he try [[nudism]]. Hesitant at first, Gardner first attended an in-door nudist club, the Lotus League in [[Finchley]], North London, where he made several new friends and felt that the nudity cured his ailment. When summer came, he decided to visit an outdoor nudist club, that of Fouracres near the town of [[Bricket Wood]] in [[Hertfordshire]], which he soon began to frequent.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=152\u2013154}} Through nudism, Gardner made a number of notable friends, including [[James Laver]] (1899\u20131975), who became the Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and Cottie Arthur Burland (1905\u20131983), who was the Curator of the Department of Ethnography at the [[British Museum]].{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=156\u2013157}} Biographer Philip Heselton suggested that through the nudist scene Gardner may have also met Dion Byngham (1896\u20131990), a senior member of the [[Order of Woodcraft Chivalry]] who propounded a Contemporary Pagan religion known as Dionysianism.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=158\u2013159}} By the end of 1936, Gardner was finding his Charing Cross Road flat to be cramped, and moved into the block of flats at 32a Buckingham Palace Mansions.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=161}}\n\n[[File:GeraldBrosseauGardnerPlaque.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque erected to mark the house at Highcliffe where Gardner lived during the Second World War.]]\n\nFearing the cold of the English winter, Gardner decided to sail to [[Cyprus]] in late 1936, remaining there into the following year. Visiting the Museum in [[Nicosia]], he studied the Bronze Age swords of the island, successfully hafting one of them, on the basis of which he wrote a paper entitled \"The Problem of the Cypriot Bronze Dagger Hilt\", which would subsequently be translated into both French and Danish, being published in the journals of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Pr\u00e9historique Fran\u00e7aise and the Vaabenhistorisk Selskab respectively.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=163\u2013165}} Back in London, in September 1937, Gardner applied for and received a [[Doctorate of Philosophy]] from the Meta Collegiate Extension of the National Electronic Institute, an organisation based in [[Nevada]] that was widely recognised by academic institutions as offering invalid academic degrees via post for a fee. He would subsequently style himself as \"Dr. Gardner\", despite the fact that academic institutions would not recognise his qualifications.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=166}}\n\nPlanning to return to the Palestinian excavations the following winter, he was prevented from doing so when Starkey was murdered. Instead he decided to return to Cyprus. A believer in [[reincarnation]], Gardner came to believe that he had lived on the island once before, in a previous life, subsequently buying a plot of land in [[Famagusta]], planning to build a house on it, although this never came about.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=170}} Influenced by his dreams, he wrote his first novel, ''A Goddess Arrives'', over the next few years. Revolving around an Englishman living in 1930s London named Robert Denvers who has recollections of a previous life as a Bronze Age Cypriot \u2013 an allusion to Gardner himself \u2013 the primary plot of ''A Goddess Arrives'' is set in ancient Cyprus and featured a queen, Dayonis, who practices sorcery in an attempt to help her people defend themselves from invading [[ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]]. Published in late 1939, biographer Philip Heselton noted that the book was \"a very competent first work of fiction\", with strong allusions to the build-up which proceeded [[World War II]].{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=169\u2013181}} Returning to London, he helped to dig shelter trenches in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] as a part of the build-up to the war, also volunteering for the [[Air Raid Precautions|Air Raid Wardens' Service]].{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=159|Heselton|2012a|2p=183}} Fearing the bombing of the city, Gardner and his wife soon moved to [[Highcliffe]], just south of the [[New Forest]] in [[Hampshire]]. Here, they purchased a house built in 1923 named Southridge, situated on the corner of Highland Avenue and Elphinstone Road.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=184\u2013185, 188\u2013189}}\n\n==Involvement in Wicca==\n\n===The Rosicrucian Order: 1938\u201339===\n{{main article|Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship}}\n[[File:templeofrosycross.png|right|thumb|upright|''The Temple of the Rose Cross'', [[Teophilus Schweighardt Constantiens]], 1618.]]\nIn Highcliffe, Gardner came across a building describing itself as the \"First Rosicrucian Theatre in England\".{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=186\u2013187}} Having an interest in [[Rosicrucianism]], a prominent magico-religious tradition within [[Western esotericism]], Gardner decided to attend one of the plays performed by the group; in August 1939, Gardner took his wife to a theatrical performance based on the life of [[Pythagoras]]. An amateur thespian, she hated the performance, thinking the quality of both actors and script terrible, and she refused to go again.{{sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=162|Heselton|2012a|2pp=187\u2013188, 195\u2013196}} Unperturbed and hoping to learn more of Rosicrucianism, Gardner joined the group in charge of running the theatre, the [[Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship]], and began attending meetings held in their local ''[[ashram]]''. Founded in 1920 by George Alexander Sullivan, the Fellowship had been based upon a blend of Rosicrucianism, [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]], Freemasonry and his own personal innovation, and had moved to Christchurch in 1930.{{sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=196\u2013198}}\n\nAs time went by, Gardner became critical of many of the Rosicrucian Order's practices; Sullivan's followers claimed that he was immortal, having formerly been the famous historical figures [[Pythagoras]], [[Cornelius Agrippa]] and [[Francis Bacon]]. Gardner facetiously asked if he was also the [[Wandering Jew]], much to the annoyance of Sullivan himself. Another belief held by the group that Gardner found amusing was that a lamp hanging from one of the ceilings was the disguised [[holy grail]] of [[Arthurian legend]].{{sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=163|Heselton|2012a|2p=198}} Gardner's dissatisfaction with the group grew, particularly when in 1939, one of the group's leaders sent a letter out to all members in which she stated that war would not come. The very next day, [[World War II|Britain declared war on Germany]], greatly unimpressing the increasingly cynical Gardner.{{Sfn|Bracelin|1960|p=164}}\n\nAlongside Rosicrucianism, Gardner had also been pursuing other interests. In 1939, Gardner joined the [[Folklore Society|Folk-Lore Society]]; his first contribution to its journal ''Folk-Lore'', appeared in the June 1939 issue and described a box of witchcraft relics that he believed had belonged to the 17th century \"Witch-Finder General\", [[Matthew Hopkins]]. Subsequently, in 1946 he would go on to become a member of the society's governing council, although most other members of the society were wary of him and his academic credentials.{{sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=192\u2013194, 333\u2013336}} Gardner would also join the [[Historical Association]], being elected Co-President of its Bournemouth and Christchurch branch in June 1944, following which he became a vocal supporter for the construction of a local museum for the Christchurch borough.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=296\u2013297}} He also involved himself in preparations for the impending war, joining the [[Air Raid Precautions]] (ARP) as a warden, where he soon rose to a position of local seniority, with his own house being assigned as the ARP post.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=229}} In 1940, following the outbreak of conflict, he also tried to sign up for the [[Local Defence Volunteers]], or \"Home Guard\", but was turned away because he was already an ARP warden. He managed to circumvent this restriction by joining his local Home Guard in the capacity as armourer, which was officially classified as technical staff.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=229\u2013234}} Gardner took a strong interest in the Home Guard, helping to arm his fellows from his own personal weaponry collection and personally manufacturing [[molotov cocktails]].{{Sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1pp=161\u2013167|Heselton|2012a|2p=235}}\n\n===The New Forest coven: 1939\u201344===\n{{main article|New Forest coven}}\n\nAlthough sceptical of the Rosicrucian Order, Gardner got on well with a group of individuals inside the group who were \"rather brow-beaten by the others, kept themselves to themselves.\"{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=198}} Gardner's biographer Philip Heselton theorised that this group consisted of [[Edith Woodford-Grimes]] (1887\u20131975), Susie Mason, her brother Ernie Mason, and their sister Rosetta Fudge, all of whom had originally come from [[Southampton]] before moving to the area around Highcliffe, where they joined the Order.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=198}} According to Gardner, \"unlike many of the others [in the Order], [they] had to earn their livings, were cheerful and optimistic and had a real interest in the occult\". Gardner became \"really very fond of them\", remarking that he \"would have gone through hell and high water even then for any of them.\"{{Sfn|Bracelin|1960|p=165}} In particular he grew close to Woodford-Grimes, being invited over to her home to meet her daughter, and the two helped each other with their writing, Woodford-Grimes probably assisting Gardner edit ''A Goddess Arrives'' prior to publication. Gardner would subsequently give her the nickname \"Dafo\", for which she would become better known.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=199\u2013200, 205}}\n\n[[File:Latimers.jpg|thumb|left|The Mill House in Highcliffe, where Gardner was supposedly initiated into the Craft]]\nAccording to Gardner's later account, one night in September 1939 they took him to a large house owned by [[Dorothy Clutterbuck|\"Old Dorothy\" Clutterbuck]], a wealthy local woman, where he was made to strip naked and taken through an initiation ceremony. Halfway through the ceremony, he heard the word \"Wica\", and he recognised it as an [[Old English]] word for \"witch\". He was already acquainted with [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of the [[witch-cult hypothesis|Witch-cult]], and that \"I then knew then that which I had thought burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived.\"{{sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=207\u2013215}} This group, he claimed, were the [[New Forest coven]], and he believed them to be one of the few surviving [[coven]]s of the ancient, pre-Christian Witch-Cult religion. Subsequent research by the likes of Hutton and Heselton has shown that in fact the New Forest coven was probably only formed in the mid-1930s, based upon such sources as [[folk magic]] and the theories of Margaret Murray.{{sfn|Heselton|2012a|pp=225\u2013228}}\n\nGardner only ever described one of their rituals in depth, and this was an event that he termed \"Operation Cone of Power\". According to his own account, it took place in 1940 in a part of the New Forest and was designed to ward off the Nazis from invading Britain by magical means. Gardner claimed that a \"Great Circle\" was erected at night, with a \"great cone of power\" \u2013 a form of magical energy \u2013 being raised and sent to Berlin with the command of \"you cannot cross the sea, you cannot cross the sea, you cannot come, you cannot come\".{{sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=167|Heselton|2012a|2pp=237\u2013251}}\n\n===Bricket Wood and the Origins of Gardnerianism: 1945\u201350===\n\nThroughout his time in the New Forest, Gardner had regularly travelled to London, keeping his flat at Buckingham Palace Mansions until mid-1939 and regularly visiting the [[Spielplatz]] nudist club there.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=293\u2013294}} At Spielplatz he befriended [[Ross Nichols]], whom he would later introduce to the Pagan religion of [[Neo-druidism|Druidry]]; Nichols would become enamoured with this faith, eventually founding the [[Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids]].{{Sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=295\u2013296}} However, following the war, Gardner decided to return to London, moving into 47 Ridgemount Gardens, [[Bloomsbury]] in late 1944 or early 1945.{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|p=298}} Continuing his interest in nudism, in 1945 he purchased a plot of land in Fouracres, a nudist colony near to the village of [[Bricket Wood]] in [[Hertfordshire]] that would soon be renamed Five Acres. As a result, he would become one of the major shareholders at the club, exercising a significant level of power over any administrative decisions and was involved in a recruitment drive to obtain more members.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=299\u2013309}}\n\n[[File:The Witches' Cottage.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The Witches' Cottage, where Gardner and his Bricket Wood coven performed their rituals]]\n[[File:Witches Hut 2006 side view.JPG|thumb|The Witches' Cottage in 2006]]\n\nBetween 1936 and 1939, Gardner befriended the Christian mystic [[John Sebastian Marlowe Ward|J.S.M. Ward]], proprietor of the Abbey Folk Park, Britain's oldest open-air museum. One of the exhibits was a 16th-century cottage that Ward had found near to [[Ledbury]], [[Herefordshire]] and had transported to his park, where he exhibited it as a \"witch's cottage\". Gardner made a deal with Ward exchanging the cottage for Gardner's piece of land near to Famagusta in Cyprus. The witch's cottage was dismantled and the parts transported to Bricket Wood, where they were reassembled on Gardner's land at Five Acres. In Midsummer 1947 he held a ceremony in the cottage as a form of house-warming, which Heselton speculated was probably based upon the ceremonial magic rites featured in ''[[The Key of Solomon]]'' grimoire.{{sfnm|Valiente|2007|1p=56|Heselton|2012b|2pp=315\u2013324}}\n\nFurthering his interest in esoteric Christianity, in August 1946 Gardner was ordained as a priest in the [[Ancient British Church]], a fellowship open to anyone who considered themselves a [[monotheism|monotheist]]. Gardner also took an interest in Druidry, joining the [[The Druid Order|Ancient Druid Order]] (ADO) and attending its annual Midsummer rituals at [[Stonehenge]].{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=327\u2013332}}  He also joined the [[Folk-Lore Society]], being elected to their council in 1946, and that same year giving a talk on \"Art Magic and Talismans\". Nevertheless, many fellows \u2013 including [[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katherine Briggs]] \u2013 were dismissive of Gardner's ideas and his fraudulent academic credentials.{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=332\u2013338}} In 1946 he also joined the [[Society for Psychical Research]].{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|p=339}}\n\nOn May Day 1947, Gardner's friend [[Arnold Crowther]] introduced him to [[Aleister Crowley]], the ceremonial magician who had founded the religion of [[Thelema]] in 1904. Shortly before his death, Crowley elevated Gardner to the IV\u00b0 of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.) and issued a charter decreeing that Gardner could admit people into its Minerval degree. The charter itself was written in Gardner's handwriting and only signed by Crowley.{{sfnm|Bracelin|1960|1p=171|Valiente|2007|2p=57|Heselton|2012b|3pp=341\u2013362}} From November 1947 to March 1948, Gardner and his wife toured the United States visiting relatives in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], also visiting [[New Orleans]], where Gardner hoped to learn about [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]].{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=363\u2013366}} During his voyage, Crowley had died, and as a result Gardner considered himself the head of the O.T.O. in Europe, (a position accepted by [[Lady Frieda Harris]]). He met Crowley's successor, [[Karl Germer]], in New York though Gardner would soon lose interest in leading the O.T.O., and in 1951 he was replaced by [[Frederic Mellinger]] as the O.T.O.'s European representative.{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=366\u2013371}}\n\nGardner hoped to spread Wicca, and described some of its practices in a fictional form as ''High Magic's Aid''. Set in the twelfth-century, Gardner included scenes of ceremonial magic based on ''The Key of Solomon''. Published by the [[Atlantis Bookshop]] in July 1949, Gardner's manuscript had been edited into a publishable form by astrologer [[Madeline Montalban]].{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=373\u2013374, 377\u2013399}} Privately, he had also begun work on a scrapbook known as \"Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical\", in which he wrote down a number of Wiccan rituals and spells. This would prove to be the prototype for what he later termed a [[Book of Shadows]].{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=375\u2013377}} He also gained some of his first initiates, Barbara and Gilbert Vickers, who were initiated at some point between autumn 1949 and autumn 1950.{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=403\u2013409}}\n\n===Doreen Valiente and the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft: 1950\u201357===\n\nGardner also came into contact with [[Cecil Williamson]], who was intent on opening his own museum devoted to witchcraft; the result would be the [[Museum of Witchcraft|Folk-lore Centre of Superstition and Witchcraft]], opened in [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]] on the [[Isle of Man]] in 1951. Gardner and his wife moved to the island, where he took up the position of \"resident witch\".{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=410\u2013442}} On 29 July, the ''[[Sunday Pictorial]]'' published an article about the museum in which Gardner declared \"Of course I'm a witch.

In 1954, Gardner bought the museum from Williamson, who returned to England to found the rival [[Museum of Witchcraft]], eventually settling it in [[Boscastle]], [[Cornwall]]. Gardner renamed his exhibition the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft and continued running it up until his death.{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=474\u2013478, 480\u2013483}} He also acquired a flat at 145 Holland Road, near [[Shepherd's Bush]] in West London, but nevertheless fled to warmer climates during the winter, where his asthma would not be so badly affected, for instance spending time in France, Italy, and the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]].{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=450\u2013455, 457, 470\u2013473, 478\u2013480}} From his base in London, he would frequent Atlantis bookshop, thereby encountering a number of other occultists, including [[Austin Osman Spare]] and [[Kenneth Grant]], and he also continued his communication with Karl Germer until 1956.{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=505\u2013515}}\n\nIn 1952, Gardner had begun to correspond with a young woman named [[Doreen Valiente]]. She eventually requested initiation into the Craft, and though Gardner was hesitant at first, he agreed that they could meet during the winter at the home of Edith Woodford-Grimes. Valiente got on well with both Gardner and Woodford-Grimes, and having no objections to either ritual nudity or scourging (which she had read about in a copy of Gardner's novel ''High Magic's Aid'' that he had given to her), she was initiated by Gardner into Wicca on Midsummer 1953. Valiente went on to join the Bricket Wood Coven. She soon rose to become the High Priestess of the coven, and helped Gardner to revise his [[Book of Shadows]], and attempting to cut out most of Crowley's influence.{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=490\u2013494}}\n\nIn 1954, Gardner published a non-fiction book, ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'', containing a preface by [[Margaret Murray]], who had published her theory of a surviving Witch-Cult in her 1921 book, ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe''. In his book, Gardner not only espoused the survival of the Witch-Cult, but also his theory that a belief in [[fairy|faeries]] in Europe was due to a secretive pygmy race that lived alongside other communities, and that the [[Knights Templar]] had been initiates of the Craft.{{sfn|Heselton|2012b|pp=494\u2013503}} Alongside this book, Gardner began to increasingly court publicity, going so far as to invite the press to write articles about the religion. Many of these turned out very negatively for the cult; one declared \"Witches Devil-Worship in London!\", and another accused him of whitewashing witchcraft in his luring of people into covens. Gardner continued courting publicity, despite the negative articles that many tabloids were producing, and believed that only through publicity could more people become interested in witchcraft, so preventing the \"Old Religion\", as he called it, from dying out.{{sfnm|Valiente|2007|1p=67|Heselton|2012b|2pp=517\u2013520}}\n\n===Later life and death===\n\nIn 1960, Gardner's official biography, entitled ''Gerald Gardner: Witch'', was published. It was written by a friend of his, the Sufi mystic [[Idries Shah]], but used the name of one of Gardner's High Priests, [[Jack L. Bracelin]], because Shah was wary about being associated with Witchcraft.{{sfnm|Lamond|2004|1p=19|Bourne|1998|2p=29}} In May of that year, Gardner travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]], where he enjoyed a garden party in recognition of his years of service to the Empire in the Far East. Soon after his trip, Gardner's wife Donna died, and Gardner himself once again began to suffer badly from [[asthma]]. The following year he, along with Shah and Lois Bourne, travelled to the island of [[Majorca]] to holiday with the poet [[Robert Graves]], whose ''[[The White Goddess]]'' would play a significant part in the burgeoning Wiccan religion. In 1963, Gardner decided to go to [[Lebanon]] over the winter. Whilst returning home on the ship, ''The Scottish Prince'' on 12 February 1964, he suffered a fatal [[heart attack]] at the breakfast table. He was buried in [[Tunisia]], the ship's next port of call, and his funeral was attended only by the ship's captain.<ref name=\"newsworld19640223\">{{cite news |url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/Gardners%20death.htm |title=Britain's chief witch dies at sea |work=[[News of the World]] |date=23 February 1964}}</ref> He was 79 years old.\n\nThough having bequeathed the museum, all his artifacts, and the copyright to his books in his will to one of his High Priestesses, Monique Wilson, she and her husband sold off the artefact collection to the American [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] organisation several years later. Ripley's took the collection to America, where it was displayed in two museums before being sold off during the 1980s.

She discovered that the cemetery he was interred in was to be redeveloped, and so she raised enough money for his body to be moved to another cemetery in [[Tunis]],{{Sfn|Valiente|2007|p=44}} where it currently remains. In 2007, a new plaque was attached to his grave, describing him as being \"Father of Modern Wicca. Beloved of the Great Goddess\".<ref name=\"GGgrave\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/Ggrave.htm |title=Photograph of Gardner's grave |website=TheWica.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nGardner only married once, to Donna, and several who knew him made the claim that he was devoted to her. Indeed, after her death in 1960, he began to again suffer serious [[asthma]] attacks. Despite this, as many coven members slept over at his cottage due to living too far away to travel home safely, he was known to cuddle up to his young High Priestess, [[Dayonis]], after rituals.{{Sfn|Lamond|2004|p=11}}  The author [[Philip Heselton]], who largely researched Wicca's origins, came to the conclusion that Gardner had held a long-term affair with [[Edith Woodford-Grimes|Dafo]], a theory expanded upon by Adrian Bott.{{Sfn|Heselton|2003|p=26}}  Those who knew him within the modern witchcraft movement recalled how he was a firm believer in the therapeutic benefits of sunbathing.{{Sfn|Valiente|2007}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2013}}  He also had several [[tattoo]]s on his body, depicting magical symbols such as a snake, dragon, anchor and dagger.<ref name=\"dispatch19540805\">{{cite news |url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/Dispatch1.htm |title=Yes, I Am a Witch |work=Daily Dispatch |location=London |first=Arnold |last=Field |date=5 August 1954}}</ref> In his later life he wore a \"heavy bronze bracelet... denoting the three degrees... of witchcraft\"{{Sfn|Valiente|2007|p=38}} as well as a \"large silver ring with... signs on it, which... represented his witch-name 'Scire', in the letters of the magical [[Theban alphabet]].\"{{Sfn|Valiente|2007|p=38}}\n\nAccording to Bricket Wood coven member [[Frederic Lamond (Wiccan)|Frederic Lamond]], Gardner also used to comb his beard into a narrow [[goatee|barbiche]] and his hair into two horn like peaks, giving him \"a somewhat demonic appearance\".{{Sfn|Lamond|2004|p=9}}  Lamond thought that Gardner was \"surprisingly lacking in charisma\" for someone at the forefront of a religious movement.{{Sfn|Lamond|2004|p=9}}\n\nGardner was a supporter of the right wing [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and for several years had been a member of the Highcliffe Conservative Association, as well as being an avid reader of the pro-Conservative newspaper, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.{{Sfn|Heselton|2012a|p=230}}\n\n==Criticisms==\nIn a 1951 interview with a journalist from the ''[[Sunday Pictorial]]'' newspaper, Gardner said he was a doctor of philosophy from [[University of Singapore|Singapore]] and also to have a doctorate in literature from [[University of Toulouse|Toulouse]].<ref name=\"pictorial19510729\"/> Later investigation by Doreen Valiente suggested that these claims were false. The University of Singapore did not exist at that time and the University of Toulouse had no record of his receiving a doctorate. Valiente suggests that these claims may have been a form of compensation for his lack of formal education.{{Sfn|Valiente|2007|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nValiente further criticises Gardner for his publicity-seeking \u2013 or at least his indiscretion. After a series of tabloid expos\u00e9s,<ref name=\"pictorial19550612\">{{cite news |url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/GG%20sp%2055.htm |title=No Witchcraft is fun |work=[[Sunday Pictorial]] |first=Peter |last=Hawkins |page=7 |date=12 June 1955}}</ref> some members of his coven proposed some rules limiting what members of the Craft should say to non-members. Valiente reports that Gardner responded with a set of [[Wiccan laws]] of his own, which he claimed were original but others suspected he had made up on the spot.  This led to a split in the coven, with Valiente and others leaving.{{Sfn|Valiente|2007|pp=69\u201372}}  She recounted many years after his death:\n{{Quote |With all his faults (and who among us is faultless?), Gerald was a great person, and he did great work in bringing back the Old Religion to many people.  I am glad to have known him.{{Sfn|Valiente|2007|p=80}}}}\n\n==Legacy==\nCommenting on Gardner, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White commented that \"There are few figures in esoteric history who can rival him for\nhis dominating place in the pantheon of Pagan pioneers.\"{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=171}}\n\nIn 2012, [[Philip Heselton]] published a two-volume biography of Gardner, titled ''Witchfather''. The biography was reviewed by Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White in ''[[The Pomegranate]]'' journal, where he commented that it was \"more exhaustive with greater detail\" than Heselton's prior tomes and was \"excellent in most respects\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=172}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ashrama Hall and Christchurch Garden Theatre]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist |32em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Bourne |first=Lois |author-link=Lois Bourne |title=Dancing with Witches |location=London |publisher=Robert Hale |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7090-6223-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Bracelin |first=Jack |author-link=Jack L.

George See'''; February 28, 1931) is an American film and television character [[actor]], ship's ambassador, Christian activist and author, whose career spans six decades of television. He has also appeared as a guest on several talk, variety and religious shows. \n\nMacLeod's long career began in films in 1957, playing opposite [[Peter Mann]] in ''[[The Sword of Ali Baba]]'' (1965), [[Anthony Franciosa]] in ''[[A Man Called Gannon]]'' (1968), [[Christopher George]] in ''[[The Thousand Plane Raid]]'', and [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Telly Savalas]] along with [[Carroll O'Connor]] in ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' (1970). He then achieved continuing television success co-starring opposite [[Ernest Borgnine]] on ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' (1962\u20131964), as Joseph \"Happy\" Haines, and on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' (1970\u20131977) as [[Murray Slaughter]]. He is best known for his starring role on ''[[The Love Boat]]'' (1977\u20131986), in which MacLeod played Captain Merrill Stubing.\n\n==Early life==\nGavin MacLeod was born as '''Allan George See''' on February 28, 1931, in [[Mount Kisco, New York]], the elder of two children.

His first movie appearance was a small, uncredited role in ''[[The True Story of Lynn Stuart]]'' in 1958. Soon thereafter, he landed a credited role in ''[[I Want to Live!]]'', a 1958 prison drama starring [[Susan Hayward]].  He was soon noticed by [[Blake Edwards]], who in 1958 cast him in the pilot episode of his NBC series ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', two guest roles on the Edwards CBS series ''[[Mr. Lucky (TV series)|Mr. Lucky]]'' in 1959, and as a nervous harried navy [[yeoman]] in ''[[Operation Petticoat]]'', with [[Cary Grant]] and [[Tony Curtis]].  ''Operation Petticoat'' proved to be a [[breakout role]] for MacLeod, and he was soon cast in two other Edwards comedies, ''[[High Time (film)|High Time]]'', with [[Bing Crosby]] and ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'' with [[Peter Sellers]].\n\nBetween 1957 and 1961, MacLeod made several television appearances on various shows. In December 1961, he landed a guest role on ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' as Mel's cousin Maxwell Cooley, a wholesale jeweler. This was his first time working with Mary Tyler Moore. MacLeod had three guest appearances on ''[[Perry Mason]]'': in 1961 he played Lawrence Comminger in \"The Case of the Grumbling Grandfather\", and in 1965 he played Mortimer Hershey in \"The Case of the Grinning Gorilla\", and Dan Platte in \"The Case of the Runaway Racer\". He played the role of a drug pusher, \"Big Chicken\", in two episodes of the first season of ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]''.

His starring role as Captain Stubing on ''[[The Love Boat]]'', his next TV series, brought laughter to 90 countries worldwide, between 1977 and 1986 (9 seasons). His work on that show earned him three Golden Globe nominations. Co-starring with him was familiar actor and best friend [[Bernie Kopell]] as Dr. Adam Bricker and unfamiliar actor and best friend [[Ted Lange]] as bartender Isaac Washington. Lange said in a 2017 interview with The Wiseguyz Show of MacLeod that \"Oh yeah, sure, Gavin was wonderful.

Every Gopher document has a defined format and type, and the typical user navigates through a single server-defined menu system to get to a particular document. This can be quite different from the way a user finds documents on the Web.\n\nGopher remains in active use by its enthusiasts, and there have been attempts to revive Gopher on modern platforms and mobile devices. One attempt is The Overbite Project, which hosts various browser extensions and modern clients.\n\n===Server census===\n*{{As of|2012}}, there remained about 160 gopher servers indexed by [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica-2]],<ref name=\"Veronica report\">{{cite web|url=http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher/0/v2/vstat |title=Floodgap Gopher-HTTP gateway gopher://gopher/0/v2/vstat |website=Gopher.floodgap.com |date= |access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> reflecting a slow growth from 2007 when there were fewer than 100.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://db.tidbits.com/article/8909 |title=Down the Gopher Hole |last=Kaiser |first=Cameron |publisher=TidBITS |date=19 March 2007 |access-date=23 March 2007}}</ref> They are typically infrequently updated.

At a minimum, whatever a person can do with data files on a [[CD-ROM]], one can do on Gopher.\n\nA Gopher system consists of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus. The choice of menu items and titles is controlled by the administrator of the server.\n{{Double image|center|Floodgap gopher top menu.PNG|250|Floodgap gopher fun menu.PNG|{{#expr: (183 * 1249 / 755) round 0}}|The top level menu of a Gopher server. Selecting the \"Fun and Games\" menu item...|...takes the user to the \"Fun and Games\" menu.}}\n\nSimilar to a file on a Web server, a file on a Gopher server can be linked to as a menu item from any other Gopher server. Many servers take advantage of this inter-server linking to provide a directory of other servers that the user can access.\n\n===Protocol===\nThe Gopher protocol was first described in RFC 1436. [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] has assigned [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[List of well-known ports (computing)|port]] 70 to the Gopher protocol.\n\nThe protocol is simple to negotiate, making it possible to browse without using a client. A standard gopher session may therefore appear as follows:\n\n<pre>\n/Reference\n1CIA World Factbook     /Archives/mirrors/textfiles.com/politics/CIA    gopher.quux.org 70\n0Jargon 4.2.0   /Reference/Jargon 4.2.0 gopher.quux.org 70      +\n1Online Libraries       /Reference/Online Libraries     gopher.quux.org 70     +\n1RFCs: Internet Standards       /Computers/Standards and Specs/RFC      gopher.quux.org 70\n1U.S. Gazetteer /Reference/U.S. Gazetteer       gopher.quux.org 70      +\niThis file contains information on United States        fake    (NULL)  0\nicities, counties, and geographical areas.  It has      fake    (NULL)  0\nilatitude/longitude, population, land and water area,   fake    (NULL)  0\niand ZIP codes. fake    (NULL)  0\ni       fake    (NULL)  0\niTo search for a city, enter the city's name.  To search        fake    (NULL) 0\nifor a county, use the name plus County -- for instance,        fake    (NULL) 0\niDallas County. fake    (NULL)  0\n</pre>\n\nHere, the client has established a TCP connection with the server on port 70, the standard gopher port. The client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a [[Newline|line feed]] (a \"CR + LF\" sequence). This is the selector, which identifies the document to be retrieved. If the item selector were an empty line, the default directory would be selected. The server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection. According to the protocol, before the connection is closed, the server should send a full-stop (i.e., a period character) on a line by itself. However, as is the case here, not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close the connection without returning the final full-stop.\n\nIn this example, the item sent back is a gopher menu, a directory consisting of a sequence of lines each of which describes an item that can be retrieved. Most clients will display these as [[hypertext]] links, and so allow the user to navigate through gopherspace by following the links.<ref name=\"wwwunleashed\" />\n\nAll lines in a gopher menu are terminated by \"CR + LF\", and consist of five fields: the ''item type'' as the very first character (see below), the ''display string'' (i.e., the description text to display), a ''selector'' (i.e., a file-system pathname), ''host name'' (i.e., the domain name of the server on which the item resides), and ''port'' (i.e., the port number used by that server). The item type and display string are joined without a space; the other fields are separated by the tab character.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, tools such as [[netcat]] make it possible to download Gopher content easily from the command line:\n echo jacks/jack.exe | nc gopher.example.org 70 > jack.exe\nThe protocol is also supported by [[cURL]] as of 7.21.2-DEV.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curl: Re: Gopher patches for cURL (includes test suite)|url=http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0339.html|access-date=25 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155457/http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0339.html|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Source code of a menu===\nGopher menu items are defined by lines of [[tab-separated values]] in a [[text file]]. This file is sometimes called a ''gophermap''. As the [[source code]] to a gopher menu, a gophermap is roughly analogous to an [[HTML]] file for a [[web page]]. Each tab-separated line (called a ''selector line'') gives the [[client software]] a description of the menu item: what it is, what it's called, and where it leads. The client displays the menu items in the order that they appear in the gophermap.\n\nThe first character in a selector line indicates the ''item type'', which tells the client what kind of file or protocol the menu item points to. This helps the client decide what to do with it. Gopher's item types are a more basic precursor to the [[media type]] system used by the Web and [[email attachment]]s.\n\nThe item type is followed by the ''user display string'' (a description or label that represents the item in the menu); the selector (a [[Path (computing)|path]] or other string for the resource on the server); the ''hostname'' (the [[domain name]] or [[IP address]] of the server), and the [[network port]].\n\nFor example: The following selector line generates a link to the \"/home\" [[Directory (computing)|directory]] at the [[subdomain]] gopher.floodgap.com, on [[Port (computer networking)|port]] 70. The item type of {{var|1}} indicates that the resource is a Gopher menu. The string \"Floodgap Home\" is what the user  sees in the menu.\n\n 1Floodgap Home\t/home\tgopher.floodgap.com\t70\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Item type !! User display string !! Selector !! Hostname !! [[Port (computer networking)|Port]] \n|-\n| 1 || Floodgap Home || /home || gopher.floodgap.com || 70\n|}\n\nIn addition to selector lines, a gophermap may contain ''comment lines''. Comment lines are not for [[code comments]]; rather, they are lines of text sent to the client to display alongside the menu items, such as for a menu description or welcome message. A comment line contains no [[tab character]]s.\n\n====Item types====\nIn a Gopher menu's source code, a one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. This code may either be a digit or a letter of the alphabet; letters are [[case-sensitive]].\n\nThe [[technical specification]] for Gopher, RFC 1436, defines 14 item types. A one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. Item type {{code|3}} is an [[error code]] for [[exception handling]]. Gopher client authors improvised item types {{code|h}} (HTML), {{code|i}} (informational message), and {{code|s}} ([[sound file]]) after the publication of RFC 1436.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" {{partial|Canonical types}}\n|-\n| {{okay|'''0'''}} || [[Text file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''1'''}} || Gopher submenu\n|-\n| {{okay|'''2'''}} || [[CCSO Nameserver]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''3'''}} || Error code returned by a Gopher server to indicate failure\n|-\n| {{okay|'''4'''}} || [[BinHex]]-encoded file (primarily for [[Macintosh]] computers)\n|-\n| {{okay|'''5'''}} || [[DOS]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''6'''}} || [[uuencoded]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''7'''}} || Gopher [[full-text search]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''8'''}} || [[Telnet]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''9'''}} || [[Binary file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''+'''}} || Mirror or alternate server (for [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] or in case of primary server [[downtime]])\n|-\n| {{okay|'''g'''}} || [[GIF]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''I'''}} || [[Image file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''T'''}} || [[Telnet 3270]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" {{unofficial|Non-canonical types}} \n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''h''' || [[HTML]] file\n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''i''' || Informational message\n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''s''' || [[Sound file]] (especially the [[WAV]] format) \n|}\n\n====URL links====\nHistorically, to create a link to a Web server, \"GET /\" was used as a pseudo-selector to emulate an [[HTTP]] [[GET request]]. [[John Goerzen]] created an addition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopher.quux.org/Archives/Mailing%20Lists/gopher/gopher.2002-02 |title=Gopher: gopher.2002-02 |publisher=Gopher.quux.org |date= |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref> to the Gopher protocol, commonly referred to as \"[[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] links\", that allows links to any protocol that supports URLs. For example, to create a link to http://gopher.quux.org/, the item type is {{code|h}}, the display string is the title of the link, the item selector is \"<nowiki>URL:http://gopher.quux.org/</nowiki>\", and the domain and port are that of the originating Gopher server (so that clients that do not support URL links will query the server and receive an HTML redirection page).\n\n===Related technology===\nThe master Gopherspace search engine is [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]]. Veronica offers a keyword search of all the public Internet Gopher server menu titles. A Veronica search produces a menu of Gopher items, each of which is a direct pointer to a Gopher data source. Individual Gopher servers may also use localized search engines specific to their content such as [[Jughead (search engine)|Jughead]] and [[Jughead (search engine)|Jugtail]].\n\n[[GopherVR]] is a 3D virtual reality variant of the original Gopher system.\n\n==Client software==\n===Web browsers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Browser\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Version\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | {{nowrap|First supported}}\n! scope=\"col\" | {{nowrap|Last supported}}\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Camino (web browser)|Camino]]\n| {{included|1.0}}\n| {{included|2.1.2}}\n| Always uses port 70.\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Classilla]]\n| {{included|9.0}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n| Hardcoded to port 70 from 9.0\u20139.2; whitelisted ports from 9.2.1.\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[cURL]]\n| {{included|7.21.2<br>{{small|(October 2010)}}}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n| cURL is a command-line file transfer utility\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[ELinks]]\n| {{optional|0.10.0}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Fonseca|first=Jonas|title=elinks-users ANNOUNCE ELinks-0.10.0 (Thelma)|url=http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/elinks-users/2004-December/000785.html|publisher=[[Linux From Scratch]]|access-date=22 May 2010|date=24 December 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220130659/http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/elinks-users/2004-December/000785.html|archivedate=20 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n| {{dunno}}\n| Offers support as a build option\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Web (web browser)|Epiphany]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{dropped|2.26.3}}\n|Disabled after switch to [[WebKit]]\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Galeon]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|2.0.7}}\n| \n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Google Chrome]]\n| {{Needs|With extension only}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11345|title=Issue 11345: gopher protocol doesn't work|access-date=25 July 2011|date=2 May 2009|author=hotaru.firefly|publisher=Google|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n| {{N/A}}\n| The Overbite extension<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/|title=The Overbite Project @ Floodgap -- Gopher Client Software for Modern Operating Systems, Browsers and Mobile Devices (OverbiteFF [Firefox], Overbite Android)|author=|date=|website=gopher.floodgap.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111060216/http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/|archivedate=11 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> that automatically forwards to Gopher proxies is no longer compatible with Chrome.\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Internet Explorer]]\n| {{N/A}}\n| {{optional|6.0 SP1+}}\n| Supported added by MS02-047 to IE 6 SP1 can be enabled in the [[Windows Registry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-047.mspx |title=Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-047 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=28 February 2003 |access-date=23 March 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61CUyjRrX?url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-047.mspx |archivedate=25 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Always uses port 70.\n|-\n! {{rh2}} | [[Internet Explorer for Mac]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|5.2.3}}\n| PowerPC-only\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[K-Meleon]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n|\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Konqueror]]\n| {{Needs|With plug-in only}}\n| {{dunno}}\n| Requires kio_gopher plug-in<ref>{{cite web|url=http://userbase.kde.org/Kio_gopher|title=Kio gopher - KDE UserBase Wiki|author=|date=|website=userbase.kde.org|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501125030/https://userbase.kde.org/Kio_gopher|archivedate=1 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[libwww]]\n| {{included|1.0c<br>{{small|(December 1992)}}}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n| libwww is an [[Application programming interface|API]] for internet applications\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Line Mode Browser]]\n| {{included||1.1<br>{{small|(January 1992)}}}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n|\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|Present(3.0)}}\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Mozilla Firefox]]\n| {{included|0.0}}\n| {{dropped|3.6}}\n| Built-in support dropped from Firefox 4.0 onwards;<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=388195| title=Bug 388195 \u2013 Remove gopher protocol support for Firefox | access-date=15 June 2010}}</ref> can be added back to [https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-add-technology-modernizing Firefox < 57] with [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/overbiteff/ OverbiteFF] and Firefox > 57 with [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/overbitewx/ OverbiteWX].

These are usually held for a nation's primary legislative body, as distinguished from [[by-election]]s and [[local election]]s.\n\nIn [[Presidential system|presidential systems]], a general election is a [[fixed-term election|regularly scheduled]] election where both the president, and either \"[[Staggered elections|a class]]\" of or all members of the national legislature are elected at the same time but can also involve special elections held to fill prematurely vacated positions. A general election day may also include elections for local officials.\n\nThe term originates in the [[elections in the United Kingdom]] for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] started on November 26 1962.\n\n==India ==\n{{main|Elections in India}}\nThe elections held to elect the members of the Lok Sabha after expiry of the Parliamentary Elections. Earlier up to 1957 simultaneous elections were held for both the Lok Sabha and the State Assemblies. However, on account of early dismissal and mid-term elections the two got separated.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n{{see also|Elections in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom general elections overview}}\nThe term ''general election'' in the United Kingdom often refers to the elections held on the same day in all constituencies of their [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Under the terms of the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], the period between one general election and the next is fixed at 5 years, unless the Commons passes a motion of no confidence in the Government sooner than that, or if the House of Commons, with the support of at least two thirds of its members, resolves that a general election should take place sooner.\n\nThe term may also be used to refer to elections to any democratically elected body in which all of the members are up for election. Section 2 of the Scotland Act 1998, for example, specifically refers to ordinary elections to the Scottish Parliament as general elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_2#pt1-pb2-l1g2|title=Scotland Act 1998|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, British elections took place over a period of several weeks, with individual constituencies holding polling on separate days. The [[Parliament Act 1911]] introduced the requirement that elections in all parliamentary constituencies be held on the same day. There has been a convention since the 1930s that general elections in Britain should take place on a Thursday; the last general election to take place on any other weekday was that of [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931]].\n\nThe five-year limit on the time of a Parliament can be varied by an Act of Parliament implemented by several bodies. This was done during both World Wars; the Parliament elected in [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] was prolonged to November 1918, and that elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|November 1935]] lasted until June 1945. The [[House of Lords]] has an absolute veto on any Bill to extend the life of Parliament.\n\n==United States ==\n{{Main|Elections in the United States}}\n\nIn U.S. politics, general elections are elections held at any level (e.g. city, county, congressional district, state) that typically involve competition between at least two parties.  General elections occur every two to six years (depending on the positions being filled with most positions good for four years) and include the presidential election, but unlike parliamentary systems the term can also refer to special elections that fill out positions prematurely vacated by the previous office holder (e.g. through death, resignation, etc.). Some parallels can be drawn between the general election in parliamentary systems and the biennial [[United States House of Representatives#Elections|elections determining all House seats]], although there is no analogue to \"calling early elections\" in the U.S., and the members of the elected [[U.S. Senate]] face elections of only one-third at a time at two-year intervals including during a general election.<!-- citation needed -->\n\nUnlike parliamentary systems where the term ''general election'' is distinguished from by-elections, the term in is used the US in reference to and distinguished from primaries or caucuses, which are intra-party elections meant to select a party's official candidate for a particular race.\n\nIn the [[Louisiana#politics|State of Louisiana]] the expression ''general election'' means the [[runoff election]] which occurs between the two highest candidates as determined by the [[jungle primary]].<ref>Chapter 5 of the [http://www.lawserver.com/law/state/louisiana/la-laws/louisiana_revised_statutes_18-401 ''Louisiana Election Code''], incorporating Section 18:401 of the ''Louisiana Revised Statutes''.</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060715071321/http://www.idea.int/elections/index.cfm International IDEA's Electoral Processes Program]\n*[http://dca.tufts.edu/features/aas A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787-1825]\n*[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/ General Election 2010]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:General Election}}\n[[Category:Elections]]\n[[Category:General elections| ]]", "sha1": "gwufhjumh3kpqbuu2d0yk3lmpn2u2g5"}}, {"title": "Genotype", "ns": "0", "id": "12796", "revision": {"id": "858229913", "parentid": "857812490", "timestamp": "2018-09-05T20:56:57Z", "contributor": {"username": "GreenC bot", "id": "27823944"}, "comment": "Remove 1 stray access-date.

Not all organisms with the same genotype look or act the same way because appearance and behavior are modified by environmental and growing conditions. Likewise, not all organisms that look alike necessarily have the same genotype.\n\nOne's genotype differs subtly from one's genomic sequence, because it refers to how an individual ''differs'' or is specialized within a group of individuals or a species. So, typically, one refers to an individual's genotype with regard to a particular [[gene]] of interest and the combination of [[allele]]s the individual carries (see [[homozygous]], [[heterozygous]]).<ref>Griffiths AJF, Gelbart WM, Miller JH, et al. Modern Genetic Analysis. New York: W. H. Freeman; 1999. Genetics begins with Variation. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21344/</ref> Genotypes are often denoted with letters, for example ''Bb'', where ''B'' stands for one allele and ''b'' for another.\n\n[[Somatic mutation|Somatic mutations]] which are acquired rather than inherited, such as those in cancers, are not part of the individual's genotype. Hence, scientists and [[Physician|physicians]] sometimes talk about the genotype of a particular [[cancer]], that is, of the disease as distinct from the diseased.\n\nAn example of a characteristic determined by a genotype is the [[petal color]] in a [[pea plant]]. The collection of all genetic possibilities for a single trait are called [[alleles]]; two alleles for petal color are purple and white.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Bray|first2=Dennis|last3=Hopkin|first3=Karen|last4=Johnson|first4=Alexander|last5=Lewis|first5=Julian|last6=Raff|first6=Martin|last7=Roberts|first7=Keith|last8=Walter|first8=Peter|title=Essential Cell Biology|date=2014|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8153-4454-4|pages=659|edition=4}}</ref>\n\n==Phenotype==\n{{main|Phenotype}}\n\nAny given gene will usually cause an observable change in an organism, known as the phenotype.  The terms [[Genotype-phenotype distinction|genotype and phenotype]] are distinct for at least two reasons:\n\n#To distinguish the source of an observer's knowledge (one can know about genotype by observing DNA; one can know about phenotype by observing outward appearance of an organism).\n#Genotype and phenotype are not always directly correlated.  Some genes only express a given phenotype in certain environmental conditions.  Conversely, some phenotypes could be the result of multiple genotypes. The genotype is commonly mixed up with the phenotype which describes the end result of both the genetic and the environmental factors giving the observed expression (e.g. blue eyes, hair color, or various hereditary diseases).\n\nA simple example to illustrate genotype as distinct from phenotype is the flower colour in pea plants (see [[Gregor Mendel]]). There are three available genotypes, PP (homozygous dominant), Pp (heterozygous), and pp (homozygous recessive). All three have different genotypes but the first two have the same phenotype (purple) as distinct from the third (white).\n\nA more technical example to illustrate genotype is the [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] or SNP.  A SNP occurs when corresponding sequences of DNA from different individuals differ at one DNA base, for example where the sequence AAGCCTA changes to AAGCTTA. This contains two alleles : C and T. SNPs typically have three genotypes, denoted generically AA Aa and aa. In the example above, the three genotypes would be CC, CT and TT. Other types of [[genetic marker]], such as [[microsatellite]]s, can have more than two alleles, and thus many different genotypes.\n\nPenetrance is the proportion of individuals showing a specified genotype in their phenotype under a given set of environmental conditions.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/260204631|title=A dictionary of zoology |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |editor=Allaby, Michael |isbn=9780199233410 |edition=3rd |location=Oxford |oclc=260204631}}</ref>\n\n==Mendelian inheritance==\n{{main|Mendelian inheritance}}\n\nThe distinction between genotype and phenotype is commonly experienced when studying family patterns for certain [[Genetic disorder|hereditary diseases]] or conditions, for example, [[hemophilia]].  Humans and most animals are diploid; thus there are two [[allele]]s for any given gene. These [[allele]]s can be the same (homozygous) or different (heterozygous), depending on the individual (see [[zygosity|zygote]]). With a [[dominant allele]], the offspring is guaranteed to inherit the trait in question irrespective of the second allele.\n\nIn the case of an albino with a recessive allele (aa), the phenotype depends upon the other allele (Aa, aA, aa or AA). An affected person mating with a heterozygous individual (Aa or aA, also carrier) there is a 50-50 chance the offspring will be albino's phenotype. If a heterozygote mates with another heterozygote, there is 75% chance passing the gene on and only a 25% chance that the gene will be displayed. A homozygous dominant (AA) individual has a normal phenotype and no risk of abnormal offspring. A homozygous recessive individual has an abnormal phenotype and is guaranteed to pass the abnormal gene onto offspring.\n\nIn the case of hemophilia, it is sex-linked thus only carried on the X chromosome. Only females can be a carrier in which the abnormality is not displayed. This woman has a normal phenotype, but runs a 50-50 chance, with an unaffected partner, of passing her abnormal gene on to her offspring.

Of his two daughters, the eldest, [[Louise Charlotte of Brandenburg|Louise Charlotte]], married [[Jacob Kettler|Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland]], and the younger, [[Hedwig Sophia of Brandenburg|Hedwig Sophie]], married [[William VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Rule===\nIn 1619 George William inherited the [[Margravate of Brandenburg]] and the [[Duchy of Prussia]]. He paid his [[Homage (feudal)|feudal homage]] in person to the [[King of Poland]], [[Sigismund III Vasa]], in September 1621 in [[Warsaw]] (the Duchy of Prussia was a fief of the Kingdom of Poland at the time). The homage was renewed in 1633 after the election of a new Polish king, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Continental Reformed church|Reformed]] George William tried to remain neutral between the [[Roman Catholic]] forces of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] principalities. As his sister [[Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg]] was queen of [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], George William had to maneuver between requests of assistance from his Lutheran brother-in-law King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] and his own Protestant counsellors on one side and his Catholic chancellor Count [[Adam von Schwarzenberg]] on the other.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nDespite his attempts at neutrality, George William was forced by [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], since 1626 occupying [[Strait of Baltiysk|Ducal Prussia's access to the sea]], to join the Protestant forces in 1631. His rule was largely weak and ineffective, as much of government responsibilities in [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] was turned over to Schwarzenberg as the country suffered greatly during the war. Protestant and Catholic troops alike burned and plundered the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg region]] and the population was decimated there as it was throughout the [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]].<ref>Clark, p. 26.</ref> Whereas [[Ducal Prussia]] remained mostly untouched.\n\nWith his brother-in-law Gustavus dead in 1632, George William maintained the Swedish alliance until after the Swedish defeat at the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]] on 6 September 1634. At that point, George William withdrew Brandenburg from the war and signed the [[Peace of Prague (1635)|Peace of Prague]] with Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] on 30 May 1635. Leaving Schwarzenberg in charge of the government, George William withdrew in 1637 to the relatively safe region of Ducal Prussia, where he lived in retirement until his death at [[K\u00f6nigsberg|K\u00f6nigsberg in Prussia]] in 1640.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Ancestors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+''' George William's ancestors in three generations'''\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" align=\"center\"| '''George William, Elector of Brandenburg '''\n| rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| '''Father:'''<br />[[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| '''Paternal Grandfather:'''<br />[[Joachim Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg]]\n| align=\"center\"| '''Paternal Great-grandfather:'''<br />[[John George, Elector of Brandenburg]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''Paternal Great-grandmother:'''<br />[[Sophie of Legnica]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| '''Paternal Grandmother:'''<br />[[Catherine of Brandenburg-K\u00fcstrin]]\n| align=\"center\"| '''Paternal Great-grandfather:'''<br />[[John, Margrave of Brandenburg-K\u00fcstrin]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''Paternal Great-grandmother:'''<br />[[Catherine of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Margravine of Brandenburg-K\u00fcstrin|Catherine of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| '''Mother:'''<br />[[Duchess Anna of Prussia|Anna of Prussia]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| '''Maternal Grandfather:'''<br />[[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia]]\n| align=\"center\"| '''Maternal Great-grandfather:'''<br />[[Albert, Duke of Prussia]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''Maternal Great-grandmother:'''<br />[[Anna Marie of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| '''Maternal Grandmother:'''<br />[[Marie Eleonore of Cleves]]\n| align=\"center\"| '''Maternal Great-grandfather:'''<br />[[Wilhelm, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''Maternal Great-grandmother:'''<br />[[Archduchess Maria of Austria (1531\u20131581)|Archduchess Maria of Austria]]\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Clark, C.

The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term \"graphic [[design]]\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common uses of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]] and [[signage]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of graphic design}}\n[[Image:KellsFol114vTuncDicit.gif|thumb|Page from the [[Book of Kells]]: Folio 114v, Decorated text. ''Tunc dicit illis'']]The term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.<ref>Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009</ref> However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" <ref name=\":0\"/> The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the Nile, on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\", from 500 <small>AD</small> to 1450 <small>AD</small>, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"<ref>Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983</ref>\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named called the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. \"<ref name=\":1\">Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===The advent of printing===\n{{Main article|History of printing}}\nDuring the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279).<ref>\" Printing\" The Silk Road Foundation. Retrieved May 31, 2008. [http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml Silk-road.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141910/http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] <nowiki/>introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''\"squis\"'' or ''\"pin up\" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the Roman era when public notices were posted stating ''\"if anybody...\"'', which is Latin for ''\"si quis\"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.\n\nIn 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''<nowiki/>'[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick'<nowiki/>]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''<nowiki/>'[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'<nowiki/>'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''\"Weeklies\"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. ''<nowiki/>'The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.'''<ref name=\":1\" /> The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the [[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.\n\n===Design industry===\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name=mccarthy>Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}</ref>\n\n===Twentieth century design===\n[[File:VC-25(040616-F-5677R-002).jpg|thumb|right|A Boeing 747 aircraft with [[livery]] designating it as [[Air Force One]].

''Modernism in Art Design and Architecture'', New York: [[St. Martins Press]]. {{ISBN|0-312-21830-3}} (cloth) {{ISBN|0-312-21832-X}} (pbk)</ref> The post-World War II American economy revealed a greater need for graphic design, mainly in advertising and packaging. The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |title=\u0e3fEmigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}</ref> stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand.

The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].\n\nDesign can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].\n\n==Skills==\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these message. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\n===Typography===\n{{Main article|Typography}}\n\nTypography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<ref>Butterick, Matthew. \"Butterick's Practical Typography.\" Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Page layout===\n{{Main article|Page layout}}\n[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].\n\n===Printmaking===\n{{Main article|Printmaking}}\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\n==Tools==\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"[[pen]]\". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].<ref>Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19</ref> Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws & Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011</ref>\n\n===Computers and software===\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.<ref>[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007</ref> Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].<ref>Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction</ref> While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design. These include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).\n\n==Related design fields==\n===Interface design===\n{{Main article|User interface design}}\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].\n\n===User experience design===\n{{Main article|User experience design}}\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\n===Experiential graphic design===\n{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\n==Occupations==\n{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|access-date=2018-06-29|df=}}</ref> The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]\" or \"[[Graphic Artist]]\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27|df=}}</ref>\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\n===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===\n{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}\nJeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term \"[[crowdsourcing]]\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing \u2013 and Why You\u2019re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014|df=}}</ref>  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent.

It contains the [[Rift Valley lakes]], which include some of the deepest lakes in the world (up to {{convert|1470|m}} deep at [[Lake Tanganyika]]).\n\nMuch of this area lies within the boundaries of national parks such as [[Virunga National Park]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Rwenzori National Park]] and [[Queen Elizabeth National Park]] in [[Uganda]], and [[Volcanoes National Park]] in [[Rwanda]]. [[Lake Victoria]] is considered to be part of the rift valley system although it actually lies between the two branches. All of the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|African Great Lakes]] were formed as the result of the rift, and most lie within its rift valley.\n\nIn [[Kenya]], the valley is deepest to the north of [[Nairobi]]. As the lakes in the Eastern Rift have no outlet to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high [[mineral]] content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind. For example, [[Lake Magadi]] has high concentrations of soda ([[sodium carbonate]]) and [[Lake Elmenteita]], [[Lake Bogoria]], and [[Lake Nakuru]] are all strongly [[alkaline]], while the freshwater springs supplying [[Lake Naivasha]] are essential to support its current biological variety.\n\nThe southern section of the Rift Valley includes [[Lake Malawi]], the third-deepest freshwater body in the world, reaching {{Convert|706|m|}} in depth and separating the [[Niassa Province|Nyassa]] plateau of Northern Mozambique from Malawi; it ends in the [[Zambezi]] valley.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia]]\n*''[[The Great Rift: Africa's Wild Heart]]'', a [[BBC]]/[[Animal Planet]] production\n*Main earthquakes\n**[[Galilee earthquake of 1837|1837 Galilee earthquake]]\n**[[2005 Lake Tanganyika earthquake]]\n**[[2008 Lake Kivu earthquake]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Africa's Great Rift Valley'', 2001, {{ISBN|0-8109-0602-3}}\n*''Tribes of the Great Rift Valley'', 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-8109-9411-9}}\n*''East African Rift Valley lakes'', 2006, {{OCLC|76876862}}\n*''Photographic atlas of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge Rift Valley'', 1977, {{ISBN|0-387-90247-3}}\n*''Rift Valley fever : an emerging human and animal problem'', 1982, {{ISBN|92-4-170063-7}}\n*''Rift valley: definition and geologic significance'', Giacomo Corti (National Research Council of Italy, Institute of Geosciences and Earth Resources) \u2013 The Ethiopian Rift Valley, 2013, [http://ethiopianrift.igg.cnr.it]\n* [https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/05/africa/crack-africa-rift-valley-continent-splitting-two/index.html Big crack is evidence that East Africa could be splitting in two, by Lucia Perez Diaz, CNN.

He has been described as a monk or as a \"strannik\" (wanderer, or [[pilgrim]]), though he held no official position in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. After traveling to St. Petersburg, either in 1903 or the winter of 1904\u20135, Rasputin captivated some church and social leaders. He became a society figure, and met the Tsar in November 1905.\n\nIn late 1906, Rasputin began acting as a healer for the Tsar and his wife [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra]]'s son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei]], who suffered from [[hemophilia]] and was Nicholas' only heir ([[Tsarevitch]]). At court, he was a divisive figure, seen by some Russians as a mystic, visionary, and prophet, and by others as a religious [[charlatan]]. The high point of Rasputin's power was in 1915, when Nicholas II left St Petersburg to oversee Russian armies fighting [[World War I]], increasing both Alexandra and Rasputin's influence. As Russian defeats in the war mounted, however, both Rasputin and Alexandra became increasingly unpopular. In the early morning of {{OldStyleDate|30 December|1916|17 December}}, Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative noblemen who opposed his influence over Alexandra and the Tsar.\n\nHistorians often suggest that Rasputin's terrible reputation helped discredit the tsarist government, and thus helped precipitate the overthrow of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]], which happened a few weeks after he was assassinated. Very little about Rasputin's life and influence is certain, however, as accounts have often been based on hearsay, rumor, and legend.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Gorskii 04663u.jpg|thumb|Pokrovskoye in 1912]]\n[[File:Raspoutine et ses enfants.jpg|thumb|Rasputin with his children]]\n\nRasputin was born a peasant in the small village of [[Pokrovskoye, Tyumen Oblast|Pokrovskoye]], along the [[Tura River]] in the [[Tobolsk Governorate]] (now [[Tyumen Oblast]]) in [[Siberia]].{{sfn|Wilson|1964|p=23-26}} According to official records, he was born on {{OldStyleDate|21 January|1869|9 January}} and christened the following day.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=7}} He was named for [[St. Gregory of Nyssa]], whose feast was celebrated on January 10.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=14}}\n\nThere are few records of Rasputin's parents. His father, Efim (sometimes spelled Yefim), was a peasant farmer and church elder who had been born in Pokrovskoye in 1842, and married Rasputin's mother, Anna Parshukova, in 1863. Efim also worked as a government courier, ferrying people and goods between [[Tobolsk]] and [[Tyumen]]{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=6}}{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=14}} The couple had seven other children, all of whom died in infancy and early childhood; there may have been a ninth child, Feodosiya. According to historian Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin was certainly close to Feodosiya and was godfather to her children, but \"the records that have survived do not permit us to say more than that.\"{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=6}}\n\nAccording to historian [[Douglas Smith (writer)|Douglas Smith]], Rasputin's youth and early adulthood are \"a black hole about which we know almost nothing\", though the lack of reliable sources and information did not stop others from fabricating stories about his parents and his youth after Rasputin's rise to fame.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=14-15}} Historians agree, however, that like most Siberian peasants, including his mother and father, Rasputin was never formally educated, and he remained illiterate well into his early adulthood.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=14}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=9}} Local archival records suggest that he had a somewhat unruly youth \u2013 possibly involving drinking, small thefts, and disrespect for local authorities \u2013 but contain no evidence of his being charged with stealing horses, blasphemy, or bearing false witness, all major crimes that he was later rumored to have committed as a young man.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=16-17}}\n\nIn 1886, Rasputin travelled to [[Abalak, Russia|Abalak]], where he met a peasant girl named Praskovya Dubrovina. After a courtship of several months, they married in February 1887. Praskovya remained in Pokrovskoye throughout Rasputin's later travels and rise to prominence, and remained devoted to him until his death. The couple had seven children, though only three survived to adulthood: Dmitry (b. 1895), Maria (b. 1898) and Varvara (b. 1900).{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=17-18}}\n\n==Religious conversion==\n\nIn 1897, Rasputin developed a renewed interest in religion and left Pokrovskoye to go on a pilgrimage. His reasons for doing so are unclear: according to some sources, Rasputin left the village to escape punishment for his role in a horse theft.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=14}} Other sources suggest that he had a vision \u2013 either of the [[Virgin Mary]], or of [[Simeon of Verkhoturye|St. Simeon of Verkhoturye]] \u2013 while still others suggest that Rasputin's pilgrimage was inspired by his interactions with a young theological student, Melity Zaborovsky.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=20-21}} Whatever his reasons, Rasputin's departure was a radical life change: he was twenty-eight, had been married ten years, and had an infant son with another child on the way. According to Douglas Smith, his decision \"could only have been occasioned by some sort of emotional or spiritual crisis.\"{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=21}}\n\nRasputin had undertaken earlier, shorter pilgrimages to the Holy Znamensky Monastery at Abalak and to Tobolsk's cathedral, but his visit to the St. Nicholas Monastery at Verkhoturye in 1897 was transformative.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=22}} There, he met and was \"profoundly humbled\" by a ''starets'' (elder) known as Makary. Rasputin may have spent several months at Verkhoturye, and it was perhaps here that he learned to read and write, but he later complained about the monastery itself, claiming that some of the monks engaged in homosexuality and criticizing monastic life as too coercive.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=23-25}} He returned to Pokrovskoye a changed man, looking disheveled and behaving differently than he had before.  He became a vegetarian, swore off alcohol, and prayed and sang much more fervently than he had in the past.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=17}}\n\nRasputin would spend the years that followed living as a ''Strannik,'' (a holy wanderer, or pilgrim), leaving Pokrovskoye for months or even years at a time to wander the country and visit a variety of different holy sites.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=23,26}} It is possible that Rasputin wandered as far [[Mount Athos|Athos]], Greece \u2013 the center of Orthodox monastic life \u2013 in 1900.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=25-26}}\n\nBy the early 1900s, Rasputin had developed a small circle of [[acolytes]], primarily family members and other local peasants, who prayed with him on Sundays and other holy days when he was in Pokrovskoye. Building a makeshift chapel in Efim's root cellar \u2013 Rasputin was still living within his father's household at the time \u2013 the group held secret prayer meetings there. These meetings were the subject of some suspicion and hostility from the village priest and other villagers. It was rumored that female followers were ceremonially washing him before each meeting, that the group sang strange songs that the villagers had not heard before, and even that Rasputin had joined the [[Khlysty]], a religious sect whose ecstatic rituals were rumored to included self-[[flagellation]] and sexual orgies.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=28}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=19-20}} According to historian Joseph Fuhrmann, however, \"repeated investigations failed to establish that Rasputin was ever a member of the sect,\" and rumors that he was a Khlyst appear to have been unfounded.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=20}}\n\n==Rise to prominence==\n[[File:Makarij, Theofan of Poltava and Rasputin, 1909 03.jpg|thumb|Makary, [[Theofan (Bystrov)|Theofan of Poltava]] (Feofan) and Rasputin]]\n\nWord of Rasputin's activity and charisma began to spread in Siberia during the early 1900s.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=28}} Sometime between 1902 and 1904, he travelled to the city of [[Kazan]] on the [[Volga river]], where he acquired a reputation as a wise and perceptive ''starets,'' or holy man, who could help people resolve their spiritual crises and anxieties.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=50}} Despite rumors that Rasputin was having sex with some of his female followers,{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=25}} he won over the father superior of the Seven Lakes Monastery outside Kazan, as well as a local church officials [[Archimandrite]] Andrei and Bishop Chrysthanos, who gave him a letter of recommendation to Bishop Sergei, the rector of the St. Petersburg Theological Seminary at the [[Alexander Nevsky Monastery]], and arranged for him to travel to St. Petersburg, either in 1903 or in the winter of 1904\u20131905.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=50-525}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=26}}{{sfn|Radzinsky|2010|p=47-8}}\n\nUpon meeting Sergei at the Nevsky Monastery, Rasputin was introduced to a number of different church leaders, including [[Theofan (Bystrov)|Archimandrite Feofan]], who was the inspector of the theological seminary, was well-connected in St. Petersburg society, and later served as confessor to the Tsar and his wife.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=29}}{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=66}} Feofan was so impressed with Rasputin that he invited him to stay in his home, and became one of Rasputin's most important and influential friends in St. Petersburg.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=29}}\n\nAccording to Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin stayed in St. Petersburg for only a few months on his first visit and returned to Prokovskoye in the fall of 1903.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=30}} Historian Douglas Smith, however, argues that it is impossible to know whether Rasputin stayed in St. Petersburg or returned to Prokovskoye at some point between his first arrival there and 1905.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=65}} Regardless, by 1905 Rasputin had formed friendships with several members of the aristocracy, including the \"Black Princesses,\" [[Princess Milica of Montenegro|Militsa]] and [[Princess Anastasia of Montenegro|Anatasia]] of [[Montenegro]], who had married the Tsar's cousins ([[Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich of Russia|Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich]] and [[Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich]]), and were instrumental in introducing Rasputin to the Tsar and his family.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=66}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=29-30,39}}\n\nRasputin first met the Tsar on November 1, 1905, at the [[Peterhof Palace]].  The tsar recorded the event in his diary, writing that he and Alexandra had \"made the acquaintance of a man of God \u2013 Grigory, from Tobolsk province.\"{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=65}} Rasputin would not meet the Tsar and his wife again for some months: he returned to Prokovskoye shortly after their first meeting and did not return to St. Petersburg until July 1906.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=69-76}} On his return, Rasputin sent Nicholas a telegram asking to present the tsar with an icon of [[Simeon of Verkhoturye]]. He met with Nicholas and Alexandra on July 18 and again in October, when he first met their children.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=41}} At some point, the royal family became convinced that Rasputin possessed the power to heal Alexei, but historians disagree over when: according to Orlando Figes, Rasputin was first introduced to the Tsar and Tsarina as a healer who could help their son in November 1905,{{sfn|Figes|1998|p=30}} while Joseph Fuhrmann has speculated that it was in October of 1906 that Rasputin was first asked to pray for the health of Alexei.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=41-42}}\n\n==Healer to Alexei==\n[[File:\u03a1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd.jpg|thumb|Alexandra Feodorovna with her children, Rasputin and the nurse Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova (1908)]]\n\nMuch of Rasputin's influence with the royal family stemmed from the belief by Alexandra and others that he had eased the pain and stopped the bleeding of the Tsarevich \u2013 who suffered from hemophilia \u2013 on several occasions. According to historian [[Marc Ferro]], the Tsarina had a \"passionate attachment\" to Rasputin as a result of her belief that he could heal her son's affliction.{{sfn|Ferro|1995|p=137}} [[Harold Shukman]] wrote that Rasputin became \"an indispensable member of the royal entourage\" as a result.{{sfn|Shukman|p=370}} \n\nRasputin had been rumored to be capable of faith-healing since his arrival in St. Petersburg,{{sfn|Massie|p=163}} and the Tsarina's friend [[Anna Vyrubova]] became convinced that Rasputin had miraculous powers shortly thereafter. Vyrubova would become one of Rasputin's most influential advocates.{{sfn|Massie|p=168}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=46}}\n\nIt is unclear when Rasputin first learned of Alexei's hemophilia, or when he first acted as a healer for Alexei. He may have been aware of Alexei's condition as early as October 1906,{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=41-42}} and was summoned by Alexandra to pray for Alexei when he had an internal hemorrhage in the spring of 1907. Alexei recovered the next morning.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|43}}\n\nDuring the summer of 1912, Alexei developed a hemorrhage in his thigh and groin after a jolting carriage ride near the royal hunting grounds at [[Spala]], which caused a large [[hematoma]].{{sfn|Massie|p=192}} In severe pain and delirious with fever, the Tsarevich appeared to be close to death.{{sfn|Massie|p=193-195}} In desperation, the Tsarina asked Vyrubova to send Rasputin (who was in Siberia) a telegram, asking him to pray for Alexei.{{sfn|Massie|p=195}} Rasputin wrote back quickly, telling the Tsarina that \"God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.\"{{sfn|Massie|p=195}} The next morning, Alexei's condition was unchanged, but Alexandra was encouraged by the message and regained some hope that Alexei would survive. Alexei's bleeding stopped the following day.{{sfn|Massie|p=195}} \n\nHistorian [[Robert K. Massie]] has called Alexei's recovery \"one of the most mysterious episodes of the whole Rasputin legend.\"{{sfn|Massie|p=195}} The cause of his recovery is unclear: Massie speculated that Rasputin's suggestion not to let doctors disturb Alexei had aided his recovery by allowing him to rest and heal, or that his message may have aided Alexei's recovery by calming Alexandra and reducing the emotional stress on Alexei.{{sfn|Massie|p=197-8}} Alexandra, however, believed that Rasputin had performed a miracle, and concluded that he was essential to Alexei's survival.{{sfn|Massie|p=198}}\n\nSome writers and historians, such as Ferro, have claimed that Rasputin stopped Alexei's bleeding on other occasions through [[hypnosis]].{{sfn|Ferro|1995|p=137}}\n\n==Controversy==\n{{refimprovesect|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Rasputin Photo.jpg|thumb|Rasputin among admirers, 1914]]\n\nThe royal family{{snd}}and especially Alexandra's{{snd}}belief that Rasputin possessed the power to heal Alexei brought him considerable status and power at court.{{sfn|Figes|1998|p=31}} The Tsar appointed Rasputin his ''lampadnik,'' or lamplighter, who was charged with keeping the lamps that burned in front of religious icons in the palace lit and thus had regular access to the palace and royal family.{{sfn|Ferro|1995|p=138}} By December 1906, Rasputin had become close enough to the royal family to ask a special favor of the Tsar \u2013 that he be permitted to change his surname to Rasputin-Novyi (Rasputin-New). Nicholas granted the request and the name change was speedily processed, suggesting that the Tsar viewed \u2013 and treated \u2013 Rasputin favorably at that time.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=41-42}} Rasputin used his status and power to full effect, accepting bribes and sexual favors from admirers{{sfn|Figes|1998|p=31}} and working diligently to expand his influence. He soon became a controversial figure; he was accused by his enemies of religious heresy and rape, was suspected of exerting undue political influence over the tsar, and was even rumored to be having an affair with the Tsarina.{{sfn|Figes|1998|p=32-33}}\n\nEven before Rasputin's arrival in St. Petersburg in 1903, alternative religious movements such as [[spiritualism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] had become increasingly popular among the city's aristocracy, and many of them were intensely curious about the [[occult]] and the supernatural more generally.{{sfn|Figes|1998|p=29}} While fascinated by him, the Saint Petersburg [[elite]] did not widely accept Rasputin. He did not fit in with the royal family, and he and the Russian Orthodox Church had a very strained relationship. The [[Holy Synod]] frequently attacked Rasputin, accusing him of a variety of immoral or evil practices. Because Rasputin was a court official, though, he and his apartment were under 24-hour surveillance, and, accordingly, there exists some credible evidence about his lifestyle in the form of the famous \"staircase notes\" \u2013 reports from [[police]] [[Espionage|spies]], which were not given only to the Tsar but also published in [[newspapers]].{{fact|date=September 2017}}\n\n[[File:Rasputindaughtercropped.jpg|thumb|left|Rasputin with his wife and daughter [[Maria Rasputin|Matryona]] (Maria) in his St. Petersburg apartment in 1911]]\n\nAccording to Rasputin's daughter, Maria, Rasputin did \"look into\" the [[Khlysty]] sect, but rejected it.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} One Khlyst practice was known as \"rejoicing\" (\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435), a [[ritual]] which sought to overcome human sexual urges by engaging in group sexual activities so that, in consciously sinning together, the sin's power over the human was nullified.{{sfn|Radzinsky|2010|p=40}} Rasputin is said to have been particularly appalled by the belief that grace is found through [[self-flagellation]].{{fact|date=September 2017}}\n\nLike many spiritually minded Russians, Rasputin spoke of [[salvation]] as depending less on the clergy and the church than on seeking the spirit of God within. He also maintained that [[sin]] and [[repentance]] were interdependent and necessary to salvation. Thus, he claimed that yielding to [[temptation]] (and, for him personally, this meant sex and alcohol), even for the purposes of humiliation (so as to dispel the sin of [[vanity]]), was needed to proceed to repentance and salvation.{{fact|date=September 2017}} Rasputin was deeply opposed to war, both from a moral point of view and as something which was likely to lead to political catastrophe. During the years of [[World War I]], Rasputin's increasing drunkenness, sexual promiscuity and willingness to accept [[bribes]] (in return for helping petitioners who flocked to his apartment), as well as his efforts to have his critics dismissed from their posts, made him appear increasingly cynical. Attaining [[divine grace]] through [[sin]] seems to have been one of the central secret doctrines which Rasputin preached to (and practiced with) his inner circle of society ladies.{{fact|date=September 2017}}\n\nDuring World War I, Rasputin became the focus of accusations of unpatriotic influence at court. The unpopular Tsarina, meanwhile, who was of [[English people|Anglo]]-[[Germany|German]] descent, was accused of acting as a [[secret agent|spy]] in German employ.{{fact|date=September 2017}} When Rasputin expressed an interest in going to the front to bless the troops early in the war, the Commander-in-Chief, [[Grand Duke Nicholas]], promised to hang him if he dared to show up there. Rasputin then claimed that he had a revelation that the Russian armies would not be successful until the Tsar personally took command. With this, the ill-prepared Tsar Nicholas proceeded to take personal command of the Russian army, with dire consequences for himself as well as for Russia.{{fact|date=September 2017}} While Tsar Nicholas II was away at war, Rasputin's influence over Tsarina Alexandra increased.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} He soon became her [[confidant]] and personal adviser, and he convinced her to fill some governmental offices with his own handpicked candidates. To advance his power further in the highest circles of Russian society, Rasputin cohabited with upper-class women in exchange for granting political favors.{{fact|date=September 2017}} \n\n[[File:Rasputin listovka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Caricature of Rasputin and the Imperial couple (1916)]]\n\nWorld War I, the ossifying effects of [[feudalism]], and a meddling government [[bureaucracy]] all contributed to Russia's declining economy at a very rapid rate. Many at the time laid the blame with Alexandra and with Rasputin, because of his influence over her. Here is an example:\n\n<blockquote>\n[[Vladimir Purishkevich]] was an outspoken member of the [[Duma]]. On November 19, 1916, Purishkevich made a rousing speech in the Duma, in which he stated, \"The tsar's ministers who have been turned into [[marionettes]], marionettes whose threads have been taken firmly in hand by Rasputin and the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna \u2014 the evil genius of Russia and the Tsarina ... who has remained a German on the Russian throne and alien to the country and its people.\" [[Felix Yusupov]] attended the speech and afterwards contacted Purishkevich, who quickly agreed to participate in the murder of Rasputin.{{sfn|Radzinsky|2010|p=434}}\n</blockquote>\n\nRasputin's influence over the royal family was used against him and the [[Romanov]]s by politicians and journalists who wanted to weaken the integrity of the [[dynasty]], force the Tsar to give up his absolute political power and separate the Russian Orthodox Church from the state. Rasputin unintentionally contributed to their propaganda by having public disputes with [[clergy]] members, bragging about his ability to influence both the Tsar and Tsarina, and also by his dissolute and very public lifestyle. Nobles in influential positions around the Tsar, as well as some parties of the Duma, clamored for Rasputin's removal from the court. Perhaps inadvertently, Rasputin had contributed to the diminishing respect the Tsar's subjects had for him.{{fact|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Assassination attempt==\nOn {{OldStyleDate|12 July|1914|29 June}} a 33-year-old peasant woman named [[Khioniya Guseva|Chionya Guseva]] attempted to assassinate Rasputin by stabbing him in the stomach outside his home in Pokrovskoye.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|1990|p=106-7}} Rasputin was seriously wounded, and for a time it was not clear that he would survive.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|1990|p=108}}  After surgery{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=332}} and some time in a hospital in [[Tyumen]],{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=360-1}} however, he did recover.\n\nGuseva was a follower of [[Iliodor]], a former priest who had supported Rasputin before denouncing his sexual escapades and self-aggrandizement in December 1911.{{sfn|Smith|2017}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|1990|p=82}} A radical conservative and anti-semite, Iliodor had been part of a group of establishment figures who had attempted to drive a wedge between the royal family and Rasputin in 1911. When this effort failed, Iliodor had been banished from St. Petersburg and was ultimately [[defrocking|defrocked]].{{sfn|Smith|2017}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|1990|p=82-4}} Guseva claimed to have acted alone, having read about Rasputin in the newspapers and believing him to be a \"false prophet and even an Antichrist.\"{{sfn|Radzinsky|2010|p=256}} Both the police and Rasputin, however, believed that Iliodor had played some role in the attempt on Rasputin's life.{{sfn|Smith|2017}} Iliodor fled the country before he could be questioned about the assassination attempt, and Guseva was found to be not responsible for her actions due to insanity.{{sfn|Smith|2017}}\n\nAccording to his daughter Maria, Rasputin was very much changed by the experience and began to drink alcohol.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Prince Felix Yusupov.jpg|thumb|[[Felix Yusupov]] (1914) married [[Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia|Irina Aleksandrovna Romanova]], the Tsar's niece.]]\n[[File:BasementYusupovpalace.jpg|thumb|Basement of the Yusupov Palace on the Moika in St Petersburg, where Rasputin was murdered]]\n\nHaving decided that Rasputin's influence over the Tsarina had made him a threat to the empire, a group of nobles led by Prince [[Felix Yusupov]], the Grand Duke [[Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Dmitri Pavlovich]], and the right-wing politician [[Vladimir Purishkevich]] concocted a plan to kill Rasputin in December 1916, apparently by luring Rasputin to the Yusupovs' [[Moika Palace]].{{sfn|Farquhar|2001|p=197}}{{sfn|Moorehead|1958|p=107-108}}\n\nRasputin was murdered during the early morning on {{OldStyleDate|30 December|1916|17 December}}, at the home of Felix Yusupov.  He died of three gunshot wounds, one of which was a close-range shot to his forehead.  Beyond this, little is certain about his death, and the circumstances of his death have been the subject of considerable speculation.  According to historian Douglas Smith, \"what really happened at the Yusupov home on 17 December will never be known.\"{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=590, 595}} The story of Rasputin's death that Yusupov recounted in his memoirs, however, has become the most frequently told version of events.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=590-592}} \n\nAccording to Yusupov, he invited Rasputin to his home shortly after midnight and ushered him into the basement. Yusupov offered Rasputin tea and cakes which had been laced with cyanide. At first, Rasputin refused the cakes, but then began to eat them. To Yusupov's surprise, Rasputin did not appear to be affected by the poison.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=590}} Rasputin then asked for some [[Madeira wine]] (which had also been poisoned) and drank three glasses, but still showed no sign of distress. At around 2:30 am, Yusupov excused himself to go upstairs, where his fellow conspirators were waiting.  Taking a revolver from Dmitry Pavlovich, Yusupov returned to the basement and, referring to a crucifix that was in the room, told Rasputin that he'd \"better look at the crucifix and say a prayer,\" then shot him once in the chest.  Believing him to be dead, they then drove to Rasputin's apartment, with Sukhotin wearing Rasputin's coat and hat, in an attempt to make it look as though Rasputin had returned home that night.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=590-1}}  Upon returning to the Moika Palace, Yusupov went back to the basement to ensure that Rasputin was dead.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=591}} Suddenly, Rasputin leapt up and attacked Yusupov, who \u2013 with some effort \u2013 freed himself and fled upstairs. Rasputin followed and made it into the palace's courtyard before being shot by Purishkevich and collapsing into a snowbank. The conspirators then wrapped Rasputin's body in cloth, drove it to the [[Bolshoy Petrovsky Bridge|Petrovsky Bridge]] and dropped it into the [[Malaya Nevka River]].{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=591-2}}\n\nNews of Rasputin's murder spread quickly, even before his body was found. According to Douglas Smith, Purishkevich spoke openly about Rasputin's murder to two soldiers, and to a policeman who was investigating reports of shots shortly after the event, but urged them not to tell anyone else.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=597-8}} An investigation was launched the next morning, as rumors that Rasputin had been killed were already circulating.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=599}} One newspaper, the ''Stock Exchange Gazette,'' even ran a report of Rasputin's death \"after a party in one of the most aristocratic homes in the center of the city\" on the afternoon of {{OldStyleDate|30 December|1916|17 December}}.\n\n[[File:PolshoiPetrovskyMost.jpg|thumb|left|The wooden [[Bolshoy Petrovsky Bridge]], from which Rasputin's body was thrown into the [[Malaya Nevka River]]]]\n[[File:Dead Rasputin.jpg|thumb|left|Rasputin's body with bullet wound in forehead]]\n\nWhen two workmen noticed blood on the railing of the Petrovsky Bridge and a boot was found on the ice below, river police began searching the area for Rasputin's body.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=600}} His body was found under the river ice on January 1st [O.S. 19 December], approximately 200 meters downstream from the bridge.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=606}} An autopsy was conducted by Dr. Dmitry Kosorotov, the city's senior autopsy surgeon. The report that Kosorotov wrote was later lost, but he later stated that Rasputin's body had shown signs of severe trauma, including three gunshot wounds - one of which had been sustained at close range, and to the forehead - a slice wound to his left side, and many other injuries, many of which Kosorotov felt had been sustained post-mortem.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=608-610}} Kosorotov found a single bullet in Rasputin's body, but stated that it was too badly deformed and of a type too widely used to trace. He found no evidence that Rasputin had been poisoned.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=610}} According to both Douglas Smith and Joseph Fuhrmann, Kosorotov found no water in Rasputin's lungs, and reports that Rasputin had been thrown into the water alive were incorrect.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=611}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=217-219}} Contrary to some later accounts that claimed that Rasputin's penis had been severed, Kosorotov found his genitals intact.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=610}}\n\nRasputin was buried on January 2 [O.S. December 21] at a small church that Anna Vyrubova had been building at [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. The funeral was attended only by the royal family and a few of their intimates. Rasputin's wife, mistress, and children were not invited,{{sfn|Rollins|1982|p=197}} although his daughters met with the Royal family at Vyrubova's home later that day.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=612}} His body was exhumed and burned by an attachment of soldiers shortly after the Tsar abdicated the throne in March 1917,{{sfn|Rollins|1982|p=197}} in order to prevent his burial site from becoming a shrine or a rallying point for supporters of the old regime.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=650}}\n\nSome writers \u2013 including Oleg Shishkin, Andrew Cook,{{sfn|Cook|2005}} Richard Cullen, and [[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Michael Smith]]{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=203}}{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2010}} \u2013 have suggested that agents of the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Intelligence Service]] (BSIS) were involved in Rasputin's assassination.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=226}} According to this theory, British agents were concerned that Rasputin was urging the tsar to make a separate peace with Germany and withdraw from the war, and that this would allow Germany to transfer a large number of troops to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=226}} The theory suggests, in other words, that British agents played an active role in Rasputin's assassination in order to keep Russia in the war and force Germany to keep defending the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. While there are several variants of this theory, in general they suggest that British intelligence agents under the command of [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]], and in particular [[Oswald Rayner]] \u2013 who had attended [[Oxford University]] with Yusopov \u2013 were directly involved in planning and carrying out the assassination, {{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=226-7}}{{sfn|Miller|2004}} or that Rayner had personally shot Rasputin.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=227-229}} However, historians do not seriously consider this theory. According to historian Douglas Smith, \"there is no convincing evidence that places any British agents at the murder scene.\"{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=631-2}} Historian [[Keith Jeffrey]] has stated that if British Intelligence agents had been involved in the assassination of Rasputin, \"I would have expected to find some trace of that\" in the MI6 archives, but that no such evidence exists.{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2010}}\n\n==Daughter==\nRasputin's daughter, [[Maria Rasputin]] (Matryona Rasputina) (1898\u20131977), emigrated to [[France]] after the [[October Revolution]], and then to the [[United States|U.S.]] There she worked as a [[dancer]] and then a [[Lion taming|lion tamer]] in a circus.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=cp0Die6QcuIC&pg=PA162 Women of the American Circus, 1880-1940, p. 162 by Katherine H.

The carvings of [[Carl Faberg\u00e9]] are significant works in this tradition.\n\n==Characteristics and classification==\n{{Copypaste|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:Gem.pebbles.800pix.labelled.jpg|thumb|250px|A selection of gemstone pebbles made by tumbling rough rock with abrasive grit, in a rotating drum. The biggest pebble here is {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.]]\n\nThe traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], begins with a distinction between ''precious'' and ''semi-precious''; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use the precious stones are [[diamond]], [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] and [[emerald]], with all other gemstones being semi-precious.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''], Max Bauer, p. 2</ref> This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are  [[translucent]] with fine color in their purest forms, except for the colorless diamond, and very hard, with hardnesses of 8 to 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Other stones are classified by their color, [[translucency]] and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values, for example, while [[garnet]]s are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called [[tsavorite]] can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, pp. 3\u20138 {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>  Another unscientific term for semi-precious gemstones used in [[art history]] and [[archaeology]] is [[hardstone]]. Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it deceptively implies certain stones are intrinsically more valuable than others, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nIn modern times gemstones are identified by [[gemology|gemologists]], who describe gems and their characteristics using [[technical terminology]] specific to the field of [[gemology]]. The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its [[chemical composition]]. For example, [[diamond]]s are made of [[carbon]] (C) and rubies of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}). Next, many gems are crystals which are classified by their [[crystal system]] such as [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] or [[trigonal]] or [[monoclinic]]. Another term used is [[crystal habit|habit]], the form the gem is usually found in. For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as [[octahedron]]s.\n\nGemstones are classified into different ''groups'', ''species'', and ''varieties''.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Az2_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT11|title=GEM HUNTER|first=George|last=Frangoulis|date=18 April 2015|publisher=Lulu.com}}</ref> For example, ruby is the red variety of the species [[corundum]], while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the emerald (green), [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]] (blue), [[red beryl]] (red), [[goshenite]] (colorless), [[heliodor]] (yellow) and [[morganite]] (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species [[beryl]].\n\nGems are characterized in terms of [[refractive index]], [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], [[specific gravity]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[fracture]] and luster. They may exhibit [[pleochroism]] or [[double refraction]]. They may have [[luminescence]] and a distinctive [[absorption spectrum]].\n\nMaterial or flaws within a stone may be present as [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]].\n\nGemstones may also be classified in terms of their \"water\". This is a recognized grading of the gem's luster, transparency, or \"brilliance\".<ref>AskOxford.com Concise Oxford English dictionary online.</ref> Very transparent gems are considered \"[[first water]]\", while \"second\" or \"third water\" gems are those of a lesser transparency.<ref>Desirable diamonds: The world's most famous gem. by Sarah Todd.</ref>\n\n==Value==\n[[File:Spanish jewellery-Gold and emerald pendant at VAM-01.jpg|thumb|250px|Spanish emerald and gold pendant at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]] [[File:Pendant.jpg|thumb|250px|Enamelled gold, amethyst and pearl pendant, about 1880, Pasquale Novissimo (1844\u20131914), V&A Museum number M.36-1928]]\nThere is no universally accepted grading system for gemstones. Diamonds are graded using a system developed by the [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p.36 {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>\n\nA [[mnemonic device]], the \"four Cs\" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced to help the consumer understand the factors used to grade a diamond.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p. 15</ref> With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weight depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. Diamonds are meant to sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called \"cut\". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, it is the purity and beauty of that color that is the primary determinant of quality.\n\nPhysical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual [[optical phenomena]] within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) and [[star stone|asteria]] (star effects). The Greeks, for example, greatly valued asteria gemstones, which were regarded as powerful love charms, and Helen of Troy was known to have worn star-[[corundum]].<ref name=burnham>{{cite book | last = Burnham | first = S.M. | title = Precious Stones in Nature, Art and Literature | publisher = Bradlee Whidden | date = 1868}} Page 251 URL: [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 Helen of Troy and star corundum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013073718/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 |date=2010-10-13 }}</ref>\n\nAside from the [[diamond]], the [[ruby]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], [[pearl]] (not, strictly speaking, a gemstone), and [[opal]]<ref name=church>{{cite book | last = Church | first = A.H.

Up to the discoveries of bulk [[amethyst]] in Brazil in the 19th century, amethyst was considered a ''precious stone'' as well, going back to ancient Greece.

These characteristics include clarity, rarity, freedom of defects, beauty of the stone, as well as the demand for them. There are different pricing influencers for both colored gemstones, and for diamonds. The pricing on colored stones is determined by market supply-and-demand, but diamonds are more intricate.

Country of origin has sometimes been difficult to determine, due to the constant discovery of new source locations.

Amsterdam. 2012.jpg|thumb|right|A diamond cutter in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]] in 2012]]\n\nA few gemstones are used as gems in the crystal or other form in which they are found. Most however, are cut and polished for usage as jewelry. The picture to the left is of a rural, commercial cutting operation in Thailand. This small factory cuts thousands of carats of sapphire annually. The two main classifications are stones cut as smooth, dome shaped stones called [[cabochon]]s, and stones which are cut with a [[faceting machine]] by polishing small flat windows called [[facet]]s at regular intervals at exact angles.\n\nStones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as [[opal]], [[turquoise]], [[variscite]], etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone's color or surface properties as in opal and star sapphires. Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones.<ref>Introduction to Lapidary by Pansy D. Kraus</ref>\n\nGems which are transparent are normally faceted, a method which shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for [[diamond cut|faceted stones]]. The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the [[optical]] properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets.<ref>Faceting For Amateurs by Glen and Martha Vargas</ref> Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.\n\n==Colors==\n[[File:Aurora Pyramid of Hope.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Nearly 300 variations of diamond color exhibited at [[Aurora Pyramid of Hope|the Aurora display]] at the Natural History Museum in London.]]\nThe color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is actually all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. A ruby appears red because it absorbs all the other colors of white light, while reflecting the red.\n\nA material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are [[corundum]]) but exhibit different colors because of impurities. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and \"fancy sapphires\" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called \"[[Padparadscha|padparadscha sapphire]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenaturalsapphirecompany.com/blog/padparadscha-sapphires-a-buying-guide|title=Padparadscha Sapphires : 10 Tips On Judging The Rare Gem|date=2015-04-06|work=The Natural Sapphire Company Blog|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThis difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called [[impurities]] are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected.\n\nFor example, [[beryl]], which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If [[manganese]] is added instead of [[chromium]], beryl becomes pink [[morganite]]. With iron, it becomes [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]].\n\nSome gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be \"manipulated\", thus changing the color of the gem.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nGemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the stone. Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they can affect the value of the stone. Some treatments are used widely because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to the original tone.<ref>Gemstone Enhancement: History, Science and State of the Art by Kurt Nassau</ref>\n\n===Heat===\nHeat can improve gemstone color or clarity. The heating process has been well known to gem miners and cutters for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice. Most [[citrine]] is made by heating [[amethyst]], and partial heating with a strong gradient results in \u201c[[ametrine]]\u201d \u2013 a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine. [[Aquamarine (gemstone)|Aquamarine]] is often heated to remove yellow tones, or to change green colors into the more desirable blue, or enhance its existing blue color to a purer blue.<ref name=Nassau>{{cite book | last = Nassau | first = Kurt | title = Gem Enhancements | publisher = Butterworth Heineman | date = 1994}}</ref>\n\nNearly all [[tanzanite]] is heated at low temperatures to remove brown undertones and give a more desirable blue / purple color.<ref>[http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx Tanzanite Heating - The Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620222334/http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx |date=2016-06-20 }}</ref> A considerable portion of all [[sapphire]] and [[ruby]] is treated with a variety of heat treatments to improve both color and clarity.\n\nWhen jewelry containing diamonds is heated (for repairs) the diamond should be protected with [[boric acid]]; otherwise the diamond (which is pure carbon) could be burned on the surface or even burned completely up. When jewelry containing [[sapphires]] or [[rubies]] is heated, those stones should not be coated with boracic acid (which can etch the surface) or any other substance. They do not have to be protected from burning, like a diamond (although the stones ''do'' need to be protected from heat stress fracture by immersing the part of the jewelry with stones in water when metal parts are heated).\n\n===Radiation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\nVirtually all [[blue topaz]], both the lighter and the darker blue shades such as \"London\" blue, has been [[Irradiation|irradiated]] to change the color from white to blue. Most greened quartz (Oro Verde) is also irradiated to achieve the yellow-green color. Diamonds are [[Artificially irradiated diamond|irradiated]] to produce fancy-color diamonds (which occur naturally, though rarely in gem quality).\n\n===Waxing/oiling===\nEmeralds containing natural fissures are sometimes filled with wax or oil to disguise them. This wax or oil is also colored to make the emerald appear of better color as well as clarity. Turquoise is also commonly treated in a similar manner.\n\n===Fracture filling===\nFracture filling has been in use with different gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds and sapphires. In 2006 \"glass filled rubies\" received publicity. Rubies over 10 carats (2&nbsp;g) with large fractures were filled with lead glass, thus dramatically improving the appearance (of larger rubies in particular). Such treatments are fairly easy to detect.\n\n==Synthetic and artificial gemstones==\nIt is important to distinguish between synthetic gemstones, and imitation or simulated gems.\n\nSynthetic gems are physically, optically and chemically identical to the natural stone, but are created in controlled conditions in a laboratory.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrESAQAAMAAJ|title=Jewelers' Circular-keystone: JCK.|date=1994|publisher=Chilton Company|language=en}}</ref> Imitation or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone but may be optically similar to it; they can be glass, plastic, resins or other compounds.\n\nExamples of simulated or imitation stones include [[cubic zirconia]], composed of [[zirconium]] oxide and simulated [[moissanite]], which are both [[diamond simulants]]. The imitations copy the look and color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. Moissanite actually has a higher refractive index than diamond and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will have more \"fire\" than the diamond.\n\nSynthetic, cultured or lab-created gemstones are not imitations. For example, [[diamond]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s and [[emerald]]s have been manufactured in labs to possess identical chemical and physical characteristics to the naturally occurring variety. Synthetic (lab created) [[corundum]], including ruby and sapphire, is very common and costs much less than the natural stones. Smaller [[synthetic diamond]]s have been manufactured in large quantities as industrial [[abrasive]]s, although larger gem-quality synthetic diamonds are becoming available in multiple carats.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Process Promises Bigger, Better Diamond Crystals|url=http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|accessdate=7 January 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201005848/http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|archivedate=1 December 2010|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhether a gemstone is a natural stone or lab-created (synthetic), the physical characteristics are the same. Lab-created stones tend to have a more vivid color to them, as impurities are not present in a lab and do not modify the clarity or color of the stone, unless added intentionally for a specific purpose.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==List of rare gemstones==\n* [[Painite]] was discovered in 1956 in Ohngaing in Myanmar.

However today most view him as a master colourist, and a painter who according to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],  worked in a \"progressive, even enterprising, mode, casting off his late medieval heritage and proceeding with a certain purity of vision in an age of transition.\"<ref name=\"met\" />\n\nIn his early work David followed Haarlem artists such as [[Dirk Bouts]], Albert van Oudewater and [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]], though he had already given evidence of superior power as a colourist. To this early period belong the ''St John'' of the [[:de:Richard von Kaufmann|Richard von Kaufmann]] collection in Berlin and the [[George Salting|Salting]]'s ''St Jerome''. In Bruges came directly under the influence of Memling, the master whom he followed most closely. It was from him that David acquired a solemnity of treatment, greater realism in the rendering of human form, and an orderly arrangement of figures.\n\nHe visited Antwerp in 1515 and was impressed with the work of [[Quentin Matsys]],<ref name=\"h63\"/> who had introduced a greater vitality and intimacy in the conception of sacred themes.\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Rothschild Prayerbook 2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''Virgin and Child on a Crescent Moon'' in the ''[[Rothschild Prayerbook]]'', c. 1500\u201320]]\nThe works for which David is best known are the [[altarpiece]]s painted before his visit to Antwerp: the ''Marriage of St Catherine'' at the National Gallery, London; the triptych of the ''Madonna Enthroned and Saints'' of the [[Palazzo Rosso (Genoa)|Brignole-Sale collection]] in [[Genoa]]; the ''Annunciation'' of the Sigmaringen collection; and above all, the ''Madonna with Angels and Saints'' (usually titled ''The Virgin among the Virgins''), which he donated to the [[Carmelite]] Nuns of Sion at Bruges,<ref>\"Flemish and German masterpieces from the National Gallery\".

His rank among the masters was renewed, however, when a number of his paintings were assembled at the seminal 1902 [[Gruuthusemuseum]], Bruges [[Exposition des primitifs flamands \u00e0 Bruges|exhibition of early Flemish painters]].\n\nHe also worked closely with the leading [[manuscript illuminator]]s of the day, and seems to have been brought in to paint specific important miniatures himself, among them a ''Virgin among the Virgins'' in the [[Morgan Library]], a ''Virgin and Child on a Crescent Moon'' in the ''[[Rothschild Prayerbook]]'',<ref name=\"Release\">{{cite web|title=Release Announcement |url=http://www.christies.com/about/press-center/releases/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=6809 |publisher=[[Christie's]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213233031/http://www.christies.com/about/press-center/releases/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=6809 |archivedate=13 December 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref> and a portrait of the Emperor Maximilian in Vienna.

This expanded over time to include data communications, first by circuit-switched transport, then by [[Network packet|packet]] data transport via [[GPRS]] (General Packet Radio Services) and [[EDGE]] (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution, or EGPRS).\n\nSubsequently, the [[3GPP]] developed third-generation ([[3G]]) [[UMTS]] standards, followed by fourth-generation ([[4G]]) [[LTE Advanced]] standards, which do not form part of the ETSI GSM standard.\n\n\"GSM\" is a [[trademark]] owned by the [[GSM Association]]. It may also refer to the (initially) most common voice codec used, [[Full Rate]].\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1983, work began to develop a European standard for digital cellular voice telecommunications when the [[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations]] (CEPT) set up the ''Groupe Sp\u00e9cial Mobile'' (GSM) committee and later provided a permanent technical-support group based in [[Paris]]. Five years later, in 1987, 15 representatives from 13 European countries signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] in [[Copenhagen]] to develop and deploy a common cellular telephone system across Europe, and EU rules were passed to make GSM a mandatory standard.<ref>[http://www.cellular-news.com/story/25102.php EU Seeks To End Mandatory GSM for 900Mhz - Source<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The decision to develop a continental standard eventually resulted in a unified, open, standard-based network which was larger than that in the United States.<ref name=zdnet_birthday>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/mobile-devices/2007/09/07/happy-20th-birthday-gsm-39289154/ |title=Happy 20th Birthday, GSM |author=Leader |date=7 September 2007 |work=zdnet.co.uk |publisher=CBS Interactive |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yRRJnMZw?url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/mobile-devices/2007/09/07/happy-20th-birthday-gsm-39289154/ |archivedate=5 May 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2011 |quote=Before GSM, Europe had a disastrous mishmash of national analogue standards in phones and TV, designed to protect national industries but instead creating fragmented markets vulnerable to big guns from abroad. |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=etsi_gsm>{{cite web|url=http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/Technologies/gsm.aspx |title=GSM |year=2011 |work=etsi.org |publisher=European Telecommunications Standards Institute |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yRQjyd8W?url=http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/Technologies/gsm.aspx |archivedate=5 May 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2011 |quote=GSM was designed principally for voice telephony, but a range of bearer services was defined...allowing circuit-switched data connections at up to 9600 bits/s. |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=gsmworld_history>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmworld.com/about-us/history.htm |title=History |year=2001 |work=gsmworld.com |publisher=GSM Association |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yRQRGPgH?url=http://www.gsmworld.com/about-us/history.htm |archivedate=5 May 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2011 |quote=1982 Groupe Speciale Mobile (GSM) is formed by the Confederation of European Posts and Telecommunications (CEPT) to design a pan-European mobile technology. |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=etsi_cellhist>{{cite web|url=http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/Technologies/Cellularhistory.aspx |title=Cellular History |year=2011 |work=etsi.org |publisher=European Telecommunications Standards Institute |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yRQXw2sv?url=http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/Technologies/Cellularhistory.aspx |archivedate=5 May 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2011 |quote=The task was entrusted to a committee known as Groupe Sp\u00e9cial Mobile (GSMTM), aided by a \"permanent nucleus\" of technical support personnel, based in Paris. |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn February 1987 Europe produced the very first agreed GSM Technical Specification.

There are five different cell sizes in a GSM network\u2014[[macrocell|macro]], [[microcell|micro]], [[Picocell|pico]], [[femtocell|femto]], and [[umbrella cells]]. The coverage area of each cell varies according to the implementation environment. Macro cells can be regarded as cells where the [[base station]] [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] is installed on a mast or a building above average rooftop level. Micro cells are cells whose antenna height is under average rooftop level; they are typically used in urban areas. Picocells are small cells whose coverage diameter is a few dozen meters; they are mainly used indoors. Femtocells are cells designed for use in residential or small business environments and connect to the service provider\u2019s network via a broadband internet connection. Umbrella cells are used to cover shadowed regions of smaller cells and fill in gaps in coverage between those cells.\n\nCell horizontal radius varies depending on antenna height, antenna gain, and propagation conditions from a couple of hundred meters to several tens of kilometres. The longest distance the GSM specification supports in practical use is {{convert|35|km|mi|0}}. There are also several implementations of the concept of an extended cell,<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/computer-electronics-manufacturing/6838169-1.html Motorola Demonstrates Long Range GSM Capability \u2013 300% More Coverage With New Extended Cell]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219003334/http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/computer-electronics-manufacturing/6838169-1.html |date=19 February 2012 }}</ref> where the cell radius could be double or even more, depending on the antenna system, the type of terrain, and the [[timing advance]].\n\nIndoor coverage is also supported by GSM and may be achieved by using an indoor picocell base station, or an [[Cellular repeater|indoor repeater]] with distributed indoor antennas fed through power splitters, to deliver the radio signals from an antenna outdoors to the separate indoor distributed antenna system. These are typically deployed when significant call capacity is needed indoors, like in shopping centers or airports. However, this is not a prerequisite, since indoor coverage is also provided by in-building penetration of the radio signals from any nearby cell.\n\n==== GSM carrier frequencies ====\n{{Main|GSM frequency bands}}\nGSM networks operate in a number of different [[carrier frequency]] ranges (separated into [[GSM frequency ranges]] for 2G and [[UMTS frequency bands]] for 3G), with most [[2G]] GSM networks operating in the 900&nbsp;MHz or 1800&nbsp;MHz bands. Where these bands were already allocated, the 850&nbsp;MHz and 1900&nbsp;MHz bands were used instead (for example in Canada and the United States). In rare cases the 400 and 450&nbsp;MHz frequency bands are assigned in some countries because they were previously used for first-generation systems.\n\nFor comparison most [[3G]] networks in Europe operate in the 2100&nbsp;MHz frequency band. For more information on worldwide GSM frequency usage, see  [[GSM frequency bands]].\n\nRegardless of the frequency selected by an operator, it is divided into [[time division multiplexing|timeslots]] for individual phones. This allows eight full-rate or sixteen half-rate speech channels per [[radio frequency]]. These eight radio timeslots (or [[burst transmission|burst]] periods) are grouped into a [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] frame. Half-rate channels use alternate frames in the same timeslot. The channel data rate for all {{nowrap|8 channels}} is {{nowrap|270.833 kbit/s,}} and the frame duration is {{nowrap|4.615 ms.}}\n\nThe transmission power in the handset is limited to a maximum of 2 watts in {{nowrap|GSM 850/900}} and {{nowrap|1 watt}} in {{nowrap|GSM 1800/1900}}.\n\n==== Voice codecs ====\nGSM has used a variety of voice [[codec]]s to squeeze 3.1&nbsp;kHz audio into between 7 and 13&nbsp;kbit/s. Originally, two codecs, named after the types of data channel they were allocated, were used, called [[Half Rate]] (6.5&nbsp;kbit/s) and [[Full Rate]] (13&nbsp;kbit/s). These used a system based on [[linear predictive coding]] (LPC). In addition to being efficient with [[bitrate]]<nowiki/>s, these codecs also made it easier to identify more important parts of the audio, allowing the air interface layer to prioritize and better protect these parts of the signal. GSM was further enhanced in 1997<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/06_series/06.51/0651-401.zip |publisher=ETSI |title=GSM 06.51 version 4.0.1 |date = December 1997|format=ZIP |accessdate=5 September 2007}}</ref> with the [[enhanced full rate]] (EFR) codec, a 12.2&nbsp;kbit/s codec that uses a full-rate channel. Finally, with the development of [[UMTS]], EFR was refactored into a variable-rate codec called [[Adaptive Multi-Rate|AMR-Narrowband]], which is high quality and robust against interference when used on full-rate channels, or less robust but still relatively high quality when used in good radio conditions on half-rate channel.\n\n=== Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) ===\n{{Main|Subscriber Identity Module}}\nOne of the key features of GSM is the [[Subscriber Identity Module]], commonly known as a '''SIM card'''. The SIM is a detachable [[smart card]] containing the user's subscription information and phone book. This allows the user to retain his or her information after switching handsets. Alternatively, the user can change operators while retaining the handset simply by changing the SIM. Some operators will block this by allowing the phone to use only a single SIM, or only a SIM issued by them; this practice is known as [[SIM lock]]ing.\n\n=== Phone locking ===\n{{main|SIM lock}}\nSometimes [[mobile network operator]]s restrict handsets that they sell for use with their own network. This is called  ''locking'' and is implemented by a software feature of the phone. A subscriber may usually contact the provider to remove the lock for a fee, utilize private services to remove the lock, or use software and websites to unlock the handset themselves. It is possible to hack past a phone locked by a network operator.\n\nIn some countries (e.g., [[Bangladesh]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Germany]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Lebanon]], [[Malaysia]], [[Nepal]], [[Norway]], [[Pakistan]], [[Poland]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[Thailand]]) all phones are sold unlocked.<ref name=\"German_Unlock\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/21/technology/21iphone.html|title=iPhone Must Be Offered Without Contract Restrictions, German Court Rules|accessdate=2 February 2011|publisher=The New York Times|year=2007|author=Victoria Shannon}}</ref>\n\n==GSM security==\nGSM was intended to be a secure wireless system.  It has considered the user authentication using a [[pre-shared key]] and [[Challenge-response authentication|challenge-response]], and over-the-air encryption. However, GSM is vulnerable to different types of attack, each of them aimed at a different part of the network.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4756489 Solutions to the GSM Security Weaknesses], Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services, and Technologies (NGMAST2008), pp.576\u2013581, Cardiff, UK, September 2008, {{arxiv|1002.3175}}</ref>\n\nThe development of [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] introduced an optional [[Universal Subscriber Identity Module]] (USIM), that uses a longer authentication key to give greater security, as well as mutually authenticating the network and the user, whereas GSM only authenticates the user to the network (and not vice versa). The security model therefore offers confidentiality and authentication, but limited authorization capabilities, and no  [[non-repudiation]].\n\nGSM uses several cryptographic algorithms for security. The [[A5/1]], [[A5/2]], and [[A5/3]] [[stream cipher]]s are used for ensuring over-the-air voice privacy. A5/1 was developed first and is a stronger algorithm used within Europe and the United States; A5/2 is weaker and used in other countries. Serious weaknesses have been found in both algorithms: it is possible to break A5/2 in real-time with a [[ciphertext-only attack]], and in January 2007, [[The Hacker's Choice]] started the A5/1 cracking project with plans to use [[FPGA]]s that allow A5/1 to be broken with a [[rainbow table]] attack.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/7227619/Cracking-a5-THC-Wiki|title=The A5/1 Cracking Project|publisher=scribd.com |date= |accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref> The system supports multiple algorithms so operators may replace that cipher with a stronger one.\n\nSince 2000 different efforts have been made in order to crack the A5 encryption algorithms. Both A5/1 and A5/2 algorithms have been broken, and their cryptanalysis has been revealed in the literature. As an example, {{Interlanguage link multi|Karsten Nohl|de}} developed a number of [[rainbow table]]s (static values which reduce the time needed to carry out an attack) and have found new sources for [[known plaintext attack]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/29/technology/29hack.html|title=Cellphone Encryption Code Is Divulged|newspaper=New York Times|author=Kevin J.

They also noted that some carriers do not encrypt the data (i.e., using GEA/0) in order to detect the use of traffic or protocols they do not like (e.g., [[Skype]]), leaving customers unprotected. GEA/3 seems to remain relatively hard to break and is said to be in use on some more modern networks. If used with [[Subscriber Identity Module|USIM]] to prevent connections to [[fake base station]]s and [[downgrade attack]]s, users will be protected in the medium term, though migration to 128-bit GEA/4 is still recommended.\n\n== Standards information ==\nThe GSM systems and services are described in a set of standards governed by [[ETSI]], where a full list is maintained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webapp.etsi.org/key/key.asp?full_list=y|title=GSM UMTS 3GPP Numbering Cross Reference|publisher=ETSI|accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n== GSM open-source software ==\nSeveral [[open source|open-source]] software projects exist that provide certain GSM features:\n*gsmd daemon by [[Openmoko]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Gsmd |title=Gsmd \u2013 Openmoko |publisher=Wiki.openmoko.org |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n*[[OpenBTS]] develops a [[Base transceiver station]]\n*''The GSM Software Project'' aims to build a GSM analyzer for less than $1,000<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hacker's Choice Wiki|url=http://wiki.thc.org/|accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref>\n*''[[OsmocomBB]]'' developers intend to replace the proprietary baseband GSM stack with a free software implementation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bb.osmocom.org/trac |title=OsmocomBB |publisher=Bb.osmocom.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n*YateBTS develops a [[Base transceiver station]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yatebts.com |title=YateBTS |publisher=Legba Inc. |date= |accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Issues with patents and open source ===\nPatents remain a problem for any open-source GSM implementation, because it is not possible for GNU or any other free software distributor to guarantee immunity from all lawsuits by the patent holders against the users. Furthermore, new features are being added to the standard all the time which means they have patent protection for a number of years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe original GSM implementations from 1991 may now be entirely free of patent encumbrances, however patent freedom is not certain due to the United States' \"first to invent\" system that was in place until 2012. The \"first to invent\" system, coupled with \"patent term adjustment\" can extend the life of a U.S. patent far beyond 20 years from its priority date. It is unclear at this time whether [[OpenBTS]] will be able to implement features of that initial specification without limit. As patents subsequently expire, however, those features can be added into the open-source version. {{as of|2011}}, there have been no lawsuits against users of OpenBTS over GSM use.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Cellular network]]\n* [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE)\n* [[Enhanced Network Selection]] (ENS)\n* [[Call forwarding#Mobile .28cell.29 phones|GSM forwarding standard features codes]] \u2013 list of call forward codes working with all operators and phones\n* [[GSM frequency bands]]\n* [[GSM services]]\n** [[Cell Broadcast]]\n** [[GSM localization]]\n** [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] (MMS)\n** [[NITZ]] Network Identity and Time Zone\n** [[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP)\n* [[GSM-R]] (GSM-Railway)\n*[[Unstructured Supplementary Service Data|GSM USSD codes]] \u2013 Unstructured Supplementary Service Data: list of all standard GSM codes for network and SIM related functions\n* [[Handoff]]\n* [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access]] (HSDPA)\n* [[International Mobile Subscriber Identity]] (IMSI)\n* [[LTE (telecommunication)|Long Term Evolution]] (LTE)\n* [[MSISDN]] Mobile Subscriber ISDN Number\n* [[Nordic Mobile Telephone]] (NMT)\n* [[ORFS]]\n* [[Personal communications network]] (PCN)\n* [[RTP audio video profile]]\n* [[Network simulation|Simulation of GSM networks]]\n* Standards\n** [[Comparison of mobile phone standards]]\n** [[GEO-Mobile Radio Interface]]\n** [[GSM 02.07]] - Cellphone features\n** [[GSM 03.48]] \u2013 Security mechanisms for the SIM application toolkit\n** [[Intelligent Network]]\n** [[Parlay X]]\n** [[RRLP]] \u2013 Radio Resource Location Protocol\n* [[Um interface]]\n* [[Visitors Location Register]] (VLR)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book |first1=Siegmund M. |last1=Redl |first2=Matthias K. |last2=Weber |first3=Malcolm W |last3=Oliphant |title=An Introduction to GSM |date=February 1995 |publisher=Artech House |isbn=978-0-89006-785-7}}\n*{{cite book |first1=Siegmund M. |last1=Redl |first2=Matthias K. |last2=Weber |first3=Malcolm W |last3=Oliphant |title=GSM and Personal Communications Handbook |series=Artech House Mobile Communications Library |date=April 1998 |publisher=Artech House |isbn=978-0-89006-957-8}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-first=Friedhelm |editor1-last=Hillebrand  |title=GSM and UMTS, The Creation of Global Mobile Communications |date=December 2001 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-470-84322-2}}\n*{{cite book |first1=Michel |last1=Mouly |first2=Marie-Bernardette |last2=Pautet |title=The GSM System for Mobile Communications |date=June 2002 |publisher=Telecom Publishing |isbn=978-0-945592-15-0}}\n*{{cite book |first1=Salgues B. |last1=Salgues |title=Les t\u00e9l\u00e9coms mobiles GSM DCS |edition=2nd |series=Hermes |date=April 1997 |publisher=Hermes Sciences Publications|isbn=2866016068 }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|GSM Standard}}\n\n<!-- This is not an SEO opportunity.

He repeated the feat the following year, winning with a score of 8\u00bd of 9. He was being trained by [[Alexander Shakarov]] during this time.\n\nIn 1978, Kasparov participated in the [[Alexey Sokolsky|Sokolsky]] Memorial tournament in [[Minsk]]. He had been invited as an exception but took first place and became a [[chess master]]. Kasparov has repeatedly said that this event was a turning point in his life, and that it convinced him to choose chess as his career. \"I will remember the Sokolsky Memorial as long as I live\", he wrote. He has also said that after the victory, he thought he had a very good shot at the World Championship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessclub.com/help/interview |title=ICC Help: interview |accessdate=11 August 2007 |publisher=Internet Chess Club}}</ref>\n\nHe first qualified for the [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Chess Championship]] at age 15 in 1978, the youngest ever player at that level. He won the 64-player Swiss system tournament at [[Daugavpils]] on tiebreak over [[Igor V. Ivanov]] to capture the sole qualifying place.\n\nKasparov rose quickly through the [[FIDE|World Chess Federation]] rankings. Starting with an oversight by the [[Russian Chess Federation]], he participated in a grandmaster tournament in [[Banja Luka]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (then part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]), in 1979 while still unrated (he was a replacement for the Soviet [[Defection|defector]] [[Viktor Korchnoi]], who was originally invited but withdrew due to the threat of a boycott from the Soviets). Kasparov won this high-class tournament, emerging with a provisional rating of 2595, enough to catapult him to the top group of chess players (at the time, number 15 in the world)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olimpbase.org/Elo/Elo198001e.html|title=FIDE Rating List: January 1980|publisher=OlimpBase|accessdate=2 April 2011}}</ref>). The next year, 1980, he won the [[World Junior Chess Championship]] in [[Dortmund]], West Germany.

At this stage, he was already the No. 2-rated player in the world, trailing only World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov on the January 1983 list.\n\nKasparov's first (quarter-final) Candidates match was against [[Alexander Beliavsky]], whom he defeated 6\u20133 (four wins, one loss).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/8284$cix.htm |title=World Chess Championship 1982\u201384 Candidates Matches |accessdate=11 August 2007 |publisher=Mark Weeks' Chess Pages}}</ref> Politics threatened Kasparov's semi-final against Viktor Korchnoi, which was scheduled to be played in [[Pasadena, California]]. Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union in 1976, and was at that time the strongest active non-Soviet player. Various political maneuvers prevented Kasparov from playing Korchnoi, and Kasparov forfeited the match. This was resolved by Korchnoi allowing the match to be replayed in London, along with the previously scheduled match between [[Vasily Smyslov]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Ribli]]. The Kasparov-Korchnoi match was put together on short notice by [[Raymond Keene]]. Kasparov lost the first game but won the match 7\u20134 (four wins, one loss).\n\nIn January 1984, Kasparov became the [[List of FIDE chess world number ones|No. 1 ranked player]] in the world, with a FIDE rating of 2710. He became the youngest ever world No. 1, a record that lasted 12 years until being broken by [[Vladimir Kramnik]] in January 1996; the record is currently held by [[Magnus Carlsen]].\n\nLater in 1984, he won the Candidates' final 8\u00bd\u20134\u00bd (four wins, no losses) against the resurgent former world champion Vasily Smyslov, at [[Vilnius]], thus qualifying to play Anatoly Karpov for the World Championship. That year he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), as a member of which he was elected to the Central Committee of [[Komsomol]] in 1987.\n\n== 1984 World Championship ==\n{{Main|World Chess Championship 1984}}\nThe [[World Chess Championship 1984]] match between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov had many ups and downs, and a very controversial finish. Karpov started in very good form, and after nine games Kasparov was down 4\u20130 in a \"first to six wins\" match. Fellow players predicted he would be whitewashed 6\u20130 within 18 games.<ref name=\"Karpov1984\">[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/84kk$$.htm 1984 Karpov \u2013 Kasparov Title Match Highlights] Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref>\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, there followed a series of 17 successive draws, some relatively short, and others drawn in unsettled positions. Kasparov lost game 27 (5\u20130), then fought back with another series of draws until game 32 (5\u20131), earning his first-ever win against the World Champion. Another 14 successive draws followed, through game 46; the previous record length for a world title match had been 34 games, the match of [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]] vs. [[Alexander Alekhine]] in 1927.\n\nKasparov won games 47 and 48 to bring the scores to 5\u20133 in Karpov's favour. Then the match was ended without result by [[Florencio Campomanes]], the President of [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs]] (FIDE), and a new match was announced to start a few months later. The termination was controversial, as both players stated that they preferred the match to continue. Announcing his decision at a [[press conference]], Campomanes cited the health of the players, which had been strained by the length of the match.\n\nThe match became the first, and so far only, world championship match to be abandoned without result. Kasparov's relations with Campomanes and FIDE were greatly strained, and the feud between them finally came to a head in 1993 with Kasparov's complete break-away from FIDE.\n\n== World Champion ==\n[[File:Kasparov-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kasparov after winning the FIDE World Championship title in 1985]]\nThe second Karpov-Kasparov match in 1985 was organized in Moscow as the best of 24 games where the first player to win 12\u00bd points would claim the World Champion title. The scores from the terminated match would not carry over; however, in the event of a 12\u201312 draw, the title would remain with Karpov. On 9 November 1985, Kasparov secured the title by a score of 13\u201311, winning the 24th game with Black, using a [[Sicilian defense]]. He was 22 years old at the time, making him the youngest ever World Champion,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/25/world/asia/25chess.html|title=Record Set for World\u2019s Youngest Chess Champion|author =Dylan Loeb McClain |publisher= ''The New York Times'' |date=24 December 2010}}</ref> and breaking the record held by [[Mikhail Tal]] for over 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchesshof.org/hall-of-fame/world-chess-hall-of-fame/mikhail-tal/|title=Mikhail Tal|publisher=[[World Chess Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=22 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206023152/http://worldchesshof.org/hall-of-fame/world-chess-hall-of-fame/mikhail-tal/|archive-date=6 February 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Kasparov's win as Black in the 16th game has been recognized as one of the all-time masterpieces in chess history.\n\nAs part of the arrangements following the aborted 1984 match, Karpov had been granted (in the event of his defeat) a right to rematch. Another match took place in 1986, hosted jointly in London and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], with each city hosting 12 games. At one point in the match, Kasparov opened a three-point lead and looked well on his way to a decisive match victory. But Karpov fought back by winning three consecutive games to level the score late in the match. At this point, Kasparov dismissed one of his seconds, grandmaster [[Evgeny Vladimirov]], accusing him of selling his [[Chess opening|opening]] preparation to the Karpov team (as described in Kasparov's autobiography ''Unlimited Challenge'', chapter Stab in the Back). Kasparov scored one more win and kept his title by a final score of 12\u00bd\u201311\u00bd.\n\nA fourth match for the world title took place in 1987 in [[Seville]], as Karpov had qualified through the Candidates' Matches to again become the official challenger.  This match was very close, with neither player holding more than a one-point lead at any time during the contest. Kasparov was down one full point at the time of the final game, and needed a win to draw the match and retain his title. A long tense game ensued in which Karpov [[blunder (chess)|blundered]] away a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]] just before the first [[time control]], and Kasparov eventually won a long ending. Kasparov retained his title as the match was drawn by a score of 12\u201312. (All this meant that Kasparov had played Karpov four times in the period 1984\u201387, a statistic unprecedented in chess. Matches organized by FIDE had taken place every three years since 1948, and only Botvinnik had a right to a rematch before Karpov.)\n\nA fifth match between Kasparov and Karpov was held in New York and [[Lyon]] in 1990, with each city hosting 12 games. Again, the result was a close one with Kasparov winning by a margin of 12\u00bd\u201311\u00bd. In their five world championship matches, Kasparov had 21 wins, 19 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.\n\n== Break with and ejection from FIDE ==\n[[File:Kasparov-10.jpg|thumb|Kasparov and [[Viswanathan Anand]] in a publicity photo on top of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in New York]]\nWith the World Champion title in hand, Kasparov began opposing [[FIDE]]. Beginning in 1986, he created the Grandmasters Association (GMA), an organization to represent professional chess players and give them more say in FIDE's activities. Kasparov assumed a leadership role. GMA's major achievement was in organizing a series of six World Cup tournaments for the world's top players. A somewhat uneasy relationship developed with FIDE, and a sort of truce was brokered by [[Bessel Kok]], a Dutch businessman.\n\nThis stand-off lasted until 1993, by which time a new challenger had qualified through the [[Candidates Tournament|Candidates]] cycle for Kasparov's next World Championship defense: [[Nigel Short]], a British grandmaster who had defeated [[Anatoly Karpov]] in a qualifying match, and then [[Jan Timman]] in the finals held in early 1993. After a confusing and compressed bidding process produced lower financial estimates than expected,<ref>''Nigel Short: Quest for the Crown'', by Cathy Forbes</ref> the world champion and his challenger decided to play outside FIDE's jurisdiction, under another organization created by Kasparov called the [[Professional Chess Association]] (PCA). At this point, a great fracture occurred in the lineage of the FIDE World Championship. In an interview in 2007, Kasparov called the break with FIDE the worst mistake of his career, as it hurt the game in the long run.<ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1120623 'My decision to break away from fide was a mistake'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318122600/http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1120623 |date=18 March 2009 }}, ''[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]'', 10 September 2007. Retrieved 11 September 2007.</ref>\n\nKasparov and Short were ejected from FIDE, and [[World Chess Championship 1993|played their well-sponsored match]] in London. Kasparov won convincingly by a score of 12\u00bd\u20137\u00bd. The match considerably raised the profile of chess in the UK, with an unprecedented level of coverage on [[Channel 4]]. Meanwhile, FIDE organized a World Championship match between [[Jan Timman]] (the defeated Candidates finalist) and former World Champion Karpov (a defeated Candidates semifinalist), which Karpov won.\n[[File:Kasparov-44.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kasparov and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] in 2000]] \nFIDE removed Kasparov and Short from the FIDE rating lists. Thus, till this was in effect, there was a parallel rating list presented by PCA which featured all world top players, regardless of their relation to FIDE. There were now two World Champions: PCA champion Kasparov, and FIDE champion Karpov. The title remained split for 13 years.\n\nKasparov defended his title in a [[PCA World Chess Championship 1995|1995 match]] against [[Viswanathan Anand]] at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in New York City. Kasparov won the match by four wins to one, with thirteen draws. It was the last World Championship to be held under the auspices of the PCA, which collapsed when [[Intel]], one of its major backers, withdrew its sponsorship.\n\nKasparov tried to organize another World Championship match, under another organization, the World Chess Association (WCA) with [[Linares chess tournament|Linares]] organizer [[Luis Rentero]]. [[Alexei Shirov]] and Vladimir Kramnik played a candidates match to decide the challenger, which Shirov won in a surprising upset. But when Rentero admitted that the funds required and promised had never materialized, the WCA collapsed. This left Kasparov stranded, and yet another organization stepped in\u2014BrainGames.com, headed by [[Raymond Keene]]. No match against Shirov was arranged, and talks with Anand collapsed, so a match was instead arranged against Kramnik.\n\nDuring this period, Kasparov was approached by [[Oakham School]] in the United Kingdom, at the time the only school in the country with a full-time chess coach,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/expateducation/4179931/Tradition-with-an-eye-on-the-future.html|title=Tradition with an eye on the future|date=6 November 2001|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref> and developed an interest in the use of chess in education. In 1997, Kasparov supported a scholarship programme at the school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19147262.html|title=Kasparov's master class to launch chess scholarship in Britain|publisher=}}</ref> Kasparov also won the [[Marca Leyenda]] trophy that year.\n\n== Losing the title and aftermath ==\n[[File:Kasparov-11.jpg|thumb|Kasparov playing against [[Vladimir Kramnik]] in the Botvinnik Memorial match in Moscow, 2001]]\nThe Kasparov-Kramnik match took place in London during the latter half of 2000. Kramnik had been a student of Kasparov's at the famous Botvinnik/Kasparov chess school in Russia, and had served on Kasparov's team for the 1995 match against [[Viswanathan Anand]].\n\nThe better-prepared Kramnik won game 2 against Kasparov's [[Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence]] and achieved winning positions in Games 4 and 6, although Kasparov held the draw in both games. Kasparov made a critical error in Game 10 with the [[Nimzo-Indian Defence]], which Kramnik exploited to win in 25 moves. As White, Kasparov could not crack the passive but solid [[Ruy Lopez#Berlin Defence|Berlin Defence in the Ruy Lopez]], and Kramnik successfully drew all his games as Black. Kramnik won the match 8\u00bd\u20136\u00bd. Kasparov became the first player to lose a world championship match without winning a game since [[Emanuel Lasker]] lost to [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]] in 1921.\n\nAfter losing the title, Kasparov won a series of major tournaments, and remained the top rated player in the world, ahead of both Kramnik and the FIDE World Champions. In 2001 he refused an invitation to the 2002 Dortmund [[Candidates Tournament]] for the Classical title, claiming his results had earned him a rematch with Kramnik.<ref>{{cite press release |title=BGN/Dortmund Event |publisher=This Week in Chess |date=6 September 2001 |url=http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/owenbrain.html |accessdate=11 August 2001}}</ref>\n\nKasparov and Karpov played a four-game match with rapid time controls over two days in December 2002 in New York City. Karpov surprised the experts and emerged victoriously, winning two games and drawing one.<ref>[http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=661 Anatoly Karpov wins X3D Rapid Match] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019054119/http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=661 |date=19 October 2012 }}, ''ChessBase News'', 21 December 2002</ref>\n\nDue to Kasparov's continuing strong results, and status as world No. 1 in much of the public eye, he was included in the so-called \"Prague Agreement\", masterminded by [[Yasser Seirawan]] and intended to reunite the two World Championships. Kasparov was to play a match against the FIDE World Champion [[Ruslan Ponomariov]] in September 2003. But this match was called off after Ponomariov refused to sign his contract for it without reservation. In its place, there were plans for a match against [[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]], winner of the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2004]], to be held in January 2005 in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. These also fell through due to lack of funding. Plans to hold the match in Turkey instead came too late. Kasparov announced in January 2005 that he was tired of waiting for FIDE to organize a match and so had decided to stop all efforts to regain the World Championship title.\n\n== Retirement from chess ==\nAfter winning the prestigious [[Linares chess tournament|Linares tournament]] for the ninth time, Kasparov announced on 10 March 2005 that he would retire from serious competitive chess. He cited as the reason a lack of personal goals in the chess world (he commented when winning the [[Russian Chess Championship|Russian championship]] in 2004 that it had been the last major title he had never won outright) and expressed frustration at the failure to reunify the world championship.\n\nKasparov said he may play in some rapid chess events for fun, but intends to spend more time on his books, including both the ''My Great Predecessors'' series (see [[#Books and other writings|below]]) and a work on the links between decision-making in chess and in other areas of life, and will continue to involve himself in [[Politics of Russia|Russian politics]], which he views as \"headed down the wrong path\".\n\nKasparov has been married three times: to Masha, with whom he had a daughter before divorcing; to Yulia, with whom he had a son before their 2005 divorce; and to Daria (Dasha), with whom he has two children.<ref>Emma Cowing, \"[http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1024232006 Kasparov makes his first political move on Putin]\", ''The Scotsman'', 13 July 2006.</ref><ref name=\"New_Yorker\">{{cite journal |author=David Remnick |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/01/071001fa_fact_remnick?printable=true |title=The Tsar's Opponent: Garry Kasparov takes aim at the power of Vladimir Putin |accessdate=22 October 2007 |date=1 October 2007 |journal=New Yorker}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-retirement chess ===\nOn 22 August 2006, in his first public chess games since his retirement, Kasparov played in the Lichthof Chess Champions Tournament, a [[fast chess|blitz]] event played at the time control of 5 minutes per side and 3 second increments per move.

This book was subsequently updated several times after he became World Champion. Its content is mainly literary, with a small chess component of key unannotated games. He published an annotated games collection in 1985: ''Fighting Chess: My Games and Career''<ref>{{ISBN|0-7855-0863-5}}</ref> and this book has also been updated several times in further editions. He also wrote a book annotating the games from his [[World Chess Championship 1985]] victory, ''World Chess Championship Match: Moscow, 1985''.\n\nHe has annotated his own games extensively for the Yugoslav ''[[Chess Informant]]'' series and for other chess publications. In 1982, he co-authored ''Batsford Chess Openings'' with British grandmaster [[Raymond Keene]] and this book was an enormous seller. It was updated into a second edition in 1989. He also co-authored two opening books with his trainer Alexander Nikitin in the 1980s for British publisher [[Batsford]]\u2014on the [[Caro-Kann Defence#Classical / Capablanca Variation|Classical Variation of the Caro-Kann Defence]] and on the [[Sicilian Defence, Scheveningen Variation|Scheveningen Variation of the Sicilian Defence]]. Kasparov has also contributed extensively to the five-volume openings series ''Encyclopedia of Chess Openings''.\n\nIn 2000, Kasparov co-authored ''Kasparov Against the World: The Story of the Greatest Online Challenge''<ref>{{ISBN|0-9704813-0-6}}</ref> with grandmaster [[Daniel J.

This volume, which deals with the world chess champions [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], [[Emanuel Lasker]], [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], [[Alexander Alekhine]], and some of their strong contemporaries, has received lavish praise from some reviewers (including [[Nigel Short]]), while attracting criticism from others for historical inaccuracies and analysis of games directly copied from unattributed sources. Through suggestions on the book's website, most of these shortcomings were corrected in following editions and translations. Despite this, the first volume won the [[British Chess Federation]]'s Book of the Year award in 2003. Volume two, covering [[Max Euwe]], Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov and [[Mikhail Tal]] appeared later in 2003. Volume three, covering [[Tigran Petrosian]] and Boris Spassky appeared in early 2004. In December 2004, Kasparov released volume four, which covers [[Samuel Reshevsky]], [[Miguel Najdorf]], and [[Bent Larsen]] (none of these three were World Champions), but focuses primarily on [[Bobby Fischer]]. The fifth volume, devoted to the chess careers of World Champion [[Anatoly Karpov]] and challenger Viktor Korchnoi, was published in March 2006.\n\n=== ''Modern Chess'' series ===\n{{Main|My Great Predecessors#Modern Chess}}\nHis book ''Revolution in the 70s'' (published in March 2007) covers \"the openings revolution of the 1970s\u20131980s\" and is the first book in a new series called \"Modern Chess Series\", which intends to cover his matches with Karpov and selected games. The book \"Revolution in the 70s\" concerns the revolution in opening theory that was witnessed in that decade. Such systems as the controversial (at the time) [[Hedgehog Defense|\"Hedgehog\"]] opening plan of passively developing the pieces no further than the first three ranks are examined in great detail. Kasparov also analyzes some of the most notable games played in that period. In a section at the end of the book, top opening theoreticians provide their own \"take\" on the progress made in opening theory in the 1980s.\n\n=== ''Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov'' series ===\n{{Main|My Great Predecessors#Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov}}\nKasparov is publishing three volumes of his games.\n\n==='''Winter Is Coming'''===\nIn October 2015, Kasparov published a book titled Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped.

A documentary film was made about this famous matchup entitled ''[[Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine]]''.\n\nKasparov said that he was \"not well prepared\" to face Deep Blue in 1997.

In particular, he was denied access to Deep Blue's recent games, in contrast to the computer's team, which could study hundreds of Kasparov's.\n\nAfter the loss Kasparov said that he sometimes saw deep intelligence and creativity in the machine's moves, suggesting that during the second game, human chess players, in contravention of the rules, intervened. IBM denied that it cheated, saying the only human intervention occurred between games.  The rules provided for the developers to modify the program between games, an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computer's play revealed during the course of the match.

Radbruch is also regarded as one of the most influential [[legal philosopher]]s of the 20th century.\n\n==Life==\nBorn in [[L\u00fcbeck]], Radbruch studied law in [[University of Munich|Munich]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]]. He passed his first bar exam (\"[[Staatsexamen]]\") in Berlin in 1901, and the following year he received his doctorate with a dissertation on \"The Theory of Adequate Causation\". This was followed in 1903 by his qualification to teach criminal law in [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]. In 1904, he was appointed Professor of criminal and trial law and legal philosophy in Heidelberg. In 1914 he accepted a call to a professorship in [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg|K\u00f6nigsberg]], and later that year assumed a professorship at [[University of Kiel|Kiel]].<ref name=DHM>{{cite web|url=https://www.dhm.de/lemo/Biografie/gustav-radbruch|title=Biografie Gustav Radbruch (German)|publisher=Deutsches Historisches Museum|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=Bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz97652.html|title=Biografie Gustav Radbruch(German)|publisher=Bayerische Staatsbibliothek|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nRadbruch was a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), and held a seat in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] from 1920 to 1924. In 1921-22 and throughout 1923, he was minister of justice in the cabinets of [[Joseph Wirth]] and [[Gustav Stresemann]]. During his time in office, a number of important laws were implemented, such as those giving women access to the justice system, and, after the assassination of [[Walter Rathenau]], the law for the protection of the republic.\n\nIn 1926, Radbruch accepted a renewed call to lecture at [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]. After the [[Machtergreifung |Nazi seizure of power]] in January 1933, Radbruch, as a former [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic politician]], was dismissed from his university post under the terms of the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|so-called \"Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\" (''\"Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums\"'')]].  (The universities, as public bodies, were subject to civil service laws and regulations.)    Despite the employment ban in [[Nazi Germany]], during 1935/36 he was able to spend a year in [[England]], at [[University College, Oxford |University College,]] [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].   An important practical outcome of this was his book, \"Der Geist des englischen Rechts\" (''\"The Spirit of English Law\"''), although this could be published only in 1945.<ref name=GRlautRA>{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-kiel.de/grosse-forscher/index.php?nid=radbruch&lang=e|title=Famous scholars from Kiel:  Gustav Radbruch|work=The lawyer and SPD politician was Minister for Justice in the Weimar Republic.

According to this view, \"should\" can never be derived from \"Being.\" Indicative of the Heidelberg school of neokantianism to which Radbruch subscribed was that it interpolated the value-related cultural studies between the explanatory sciences (being) and philosophical teachings of values (should).\n[[File:RadbruchGrab2.jpg|thumb|His grave in Heidelberg]]\n\nIn relation to the law, this [[triadism]] shows itself in the subfields of legal sociology, legal philosophy and legal dogma. Legal dogma assumes a place in between. It posits itself in opposition to positive law, as the latter depicts itself in social reality and methodologically in the objective \"should-have\" sense of law, which reveals itself through value-related interpretation.\n\nThe core of Radbruch's legal philosophy consists of his tenets the concept of law and the idea of law. The idea of law is defined through a triad of justice, utility and certainty. Radbruch thereby had the idea of utility or usefuleness spring forth from an analysis of the idea of justice. Upon this notion was based the [[Radbruch formula]], which is still vigorously debated today. The concept of law, for Radbruch, is \"nothing other than the given fact, which has the sense to serve the idea of law.\"\n\nHotly disputed is the question whether Radbruch was a legal positivist before 1933 and executed an about-face in his thinking due to the advent of Nazism, or whether he continued to develop, under the impression of Nazi crimes, the relativistic values-teaching he had already been advocating before 1933.\n\nThe problem of the controversy between the spirit and the letter of the law, in Germany, has been brought back to public attention due to the trials of former East German soldiers who guarded the Berlin Wall\u2014the so-called necessity of following orders. Radbruch's theories are posited against the positivist \"pure legal tenets\" represented by [[Hans Kelsen]] and, to some extent, also from [[Georg Jellinek]].\n\nIn sum, [[Radbruch formula|Radbruch's formula]] argues that where [[statutory law]] is incompatible with the requirements of [[justice]] \"to an intolerable degree\", or where statutory law was obviously designed in a way that deliberately negates \"the equality that is the core of all justice\", statutory law must be disregarded by a judge in favour of the justice principle. Since its first publication in 1946 the principle has been accepted by Germany's Federal Constitutional Court in a variety of cases. Many people partially blame the older German legal tradition of [[legal positivism]] for the ease with which Hitler obtained power in an outwardly \"legal\" manner, rather than by means of a coup. Arguably, the shift to a concept of [[natural law]] ought to act as a safeguard against dictatorship, an untrammeled State power and the abrogation of civil rights.\n{{clear}}\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{wikiquote|Gustav Radbruch}}\n*{{Cite book |first=Arthur |last=Kaufmann |title=Gustav Radbruch - Rechtsdenker, Philosoph, Sozialdemokrat |publisher=Piper Verlag |location=Munich |year=1987 |language=de}}\n*{{Cite book |first=Fritz |last=von Hippel |title=Gustav Radbruch als rechtsphilosophischer Denker |publisher=Schneider Verlag |location=Heidelberg |year=1951 |language=de}}\n*{{Cite book |first=Barend |last=Van Niekerk |title=The Warning Voice from Heidelberg: the life and thought of Gustav Radbruch |location=Kenwyn |publisher=Juta |year=1973 }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{PM20|FID=pe/014008}}\n\n{{jurisprudence}}\n{{GermanJusticeMinisters}}\n{{Second Wirth cabinet}}\n{{First Stresemann cabinet}}\n{{Second Stresemann cabinet}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Radbruch, Gustav}}\n[[Category:1878 births]]\n[[Category:1949 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from L\u00fcbeck]]\n[[Category:German jurists]]\n[[Category:German military personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Justice ministers of Germany]]\n[[Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians]]\n[[Category:German Protestants]]\n[[Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni]]\n[[Category:Leipzig University alumni]]\n[[Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni]]\n[[Category:University of K\u00f6nigsberg faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Kiel faculty]]\n[[Category:Heidelberg University faculty]]\n[[Category:Members of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic]]", "sha1": "trpor4lcogz6l64yndfy12mq6wfi4uo"}}, {"title": "Great programmer", "ns": "0", "id": "12817", "redirect": {"title": "List of programmers"}, "revision": {"id": "15910474", "parentid": "684692", "timestamp": "2003-02-20T12:34:35Z", "contributor": {"username": "Egil", "id": "7457"}, "comment": "Double redirect", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[List of programmers]]", "sha1": "8lir1t3fblyksi4tq78c142tbf2lgh5"}}, {"title": "Gate", "ns": "0", "id": "12821", "revision": {"id": "863418904", "parentid": "858473273", "timestamp": "2018-10-10T17:09:04Z", "contributor": {"username": "A876", "id": "1234701"}, "comment": "mention [Portal (architecture)] (big gate).", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About | the point of entry or exit||Gate (disambiguation)|and|Gateway (disambiguation)}}\n{{No footnotes|date=September 2018}}\n[[File:Imecsfalvi sz\u00e9kelykapu.png|thumb|250px|Hand-carved wooden gate in [[Imecsfalva]], [[Sz\u00e9kely Land]], [[Transylvania]]]]\n[[File:Bab Lalla Rihana.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A monumental gate of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] also known as the Mosque of Uqba, in [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].]]\n\nA '''gate''' or '''gateway''' is a point of entry to a space which is enclosed by [[wall]]s. Gates may prevent or control the entry or exit of individuals, or they may be merely decorative. Other terms for gate include '''''yett''''' and '''''port'''''. The word derives from the old Norse \"gata\", meaning [[road]] or [[wikt:path|path]], and originally referred to the gap in the wall or fence, rather than the [[Barricade|barrier]] which closed it. The moving part or parts of a gateway may be called \"doors\", but used for the whole point of entry [[door]] usually refers to the entry to a building, or an internal opening between different rooms.\n\nA gate may have a [[latch (hardware)|latch]] to keep it from swinging and a [[lock (security device)|lock]] for security. Larger gates can be used for a whole building, such as a [[castle]] or [[fortified town]], or the actual doors that block entry through the [[gatehouse]]. Today, many gate doors are opened by an automated gate operator.\n\n==Types==\nPurpose-specific types of gate include:\n* [[Baby gate]] a safety gate to protect babies and toddlers\n* [[City gate]] of a [[walled city]]\n* [[Hampshire gate]] (a.k.a.

The Byzantines typically used it in [[Naval warfare|naval battles]] to great effect, as it could continue burning while floating on water. It provided a technological advantage and was responsible for many key Byzantine military victories, most notably the salvation of [[Constantinople]] from [[List of sieges of Constantinople|two Arab sieges]], thus securing the Empire's survival.\n\nThe impression made by Greek fire on the western European [[Crusades|Crusaders]] was such that the name was applied to any sort of incendiary weapon, including those used by Arabs, the [[China|Chinese]], and the [[Mongols]].

Also in equal amounts of each ingredient mix together black mulberry resin and Zakynthian asphault, the latter in a liquid form and free-flowing, resulting in a product that is sooty colored. Then add to the asphalt the tiniest amount of quicklime. But because the sun is at its zenith, one must pound it carefully and protect the face, for it will ignite suddenly. When it catches fire, one should seal it in some sort of copper receptacle; in this way you will have it available in a box, without exposing it to the sun.

Within a generation, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt had fallen to the Arabs, who in {{c.|lk=no|672}} set out to conquer the imperial capital of [[Constantinople]]. Greek fire was used to great effect against the Muslim fleets, helping to repel the Muslims at the [[Siege of Constantinople (674\u2013678)|first]] and [[Siege of Constantinople (718)|second]] Arab sieges of the city.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=26\u201327, 31\u201332}} Records of its use in later naval battles against the [[Saracen]]s are more sporadic, but it did secure a number of victories, especially in the phase of Byzantine expansion in the late 9th and early 10th centuries.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=61\u201362, 72}} Utilisation of the substance was prominent in Byzantine civil wars, chiefly the revolt of the thematic fleets in 727 and the large-scale rebellion led by [[Thomas the Slav]] in 821\u2013823. In both cases, the rebel fleets were defeated by the Constantinopolitan Imperial Fleet through the use of Greek fire.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=32, 46, 73}} The Byzantines also used the weapon to devastating effect against the various [[Rus' people|Rus']] raids on the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]], especially those of [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine War (941)|941]] and [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine War (1043)|1043]], as well as during the [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine War (970\u2013971)|Bulgarian war of 970\u2013971]], when the fire-carrying Byzantine ships blockaded the Danube.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=86, 189}}\n\nThe importance placed on Greek fire during the Empire's struggle against the Arabs would lead to its discovery being ascribed to divine intervention. The Emperor [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogennetos]] (r. 945\u2013959), in his book ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', admonishes his son and heir, [[Romanos II]] (r. 959\u2013963), to never reveal the secrets of its composition, as it was \"shown and revealed by an angel to the great and holy first Christian emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]]\" and that the angel bound him \"not to prepare this fire but for Christians, and only in the imperial city.\" As a warning, he adds that one official, who was bribed into handing some of it over to the Empire's enemies, was struck down by a \"flame from heaven\" as he was about to enter a church.{{sfn|Moravcsik|Jenkins|1967|pp=68\u201371}}{{sfn|Forbes|1959|p=82}} As the latter incident demonstrates, the Byzantines could not avoid capture of their precious secret weapon: the Arabs captured at least one fireship intact in 827, and the Bulgars captured several ''siph\u014dns'' and much of the substance itself in 812/814. This, however, was apparently not enough to allow their enemies to copy it (see [[#General characteristics|below]]). The Arabs, for instance, employed a variety of incendiary substances similar to the Byzantine weapon, but they were never able to copy the Byzantine method of deployment by ''siph\u014dn'', and used catapults and grenades instead.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=609\u2013611}}{{sfn|Roland|1992|pages=660, 663\u2013664}}\n\nGreek fire continued to be mentioned during the 12th century, and [[Anna Komnene]] gives a vivid description of its use in a naval battle against the [[Pisa]]ns in 1099.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=110}} However, although the use of hastily improvised [[fireships]] is mentioned during the [[Siege of Constantinople (1203)|1203 siege]] of Constantinople by the [[Fourth Crusade]], no report confirms the use of the actual Greek fire.  This might be because of the general disarmament of the Empire in the 20 years leading up to the sacking, or because the Byzantines had lost access to the areas where the primary ingredients were to be found, or even perhaps because the secret had been lost over time.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=630\u2013631}}{{sfn|Haldon|2006|p=316}}\n\nRecords of a 13th-century event in which \"Greek fire\" was used by the Saracens against the Crusaders can be read through the Memoirs of the Lord of Joinville during the [[Seventh Crusade]].

In her ''[[Alexiad]]'', Anna Komnene provides a description of an incendiary weapon, which was used by the Byzantine garrison of [[Dyrrhachium]] in 1108 against the [[Normans]].

Although quicklime was certainly known and used by the Byzantines and the Arabs in warfare,{{sfn|Partington|1999|pp=6\u201310, 14}} the theory is refuted by literary and empirical evidence. A quicklime-based substance would have to come in contact with water to ignite, while Emperor Leo's ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactica]]'' indicate that Greek fire was often poured directly on the decks of enemy ships,<ref>Leo VI, ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactica]]'', XIX.67, transl. in {{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=509}}</ref> although admittedly, decks were kept wet due to lack of sealants. Likewise, Leo describes the use of grenades,<ref>Leo VI, ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactica]]'', XIX.63, transl. in {{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=509}}</ref> which further reinforces the view that contact with water was not necessary for the substance's ignition.{{sfn|Roland|1992|p=660}} Furthermore, C.

Portable projectors (''cheirosiph\u014dnes'') were also invented, reputedly by Emperor Leo VI. The [[Byzantine military manuals]] also mention that jars (''chytrai'' or ''tzykalia'') filled with Greek fire and [[caltrop]]s wrapped with [[tow]] and soaked in the substance were thrown by catapults, while pivoting [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s (''gerania'') were employed to pour it upon enemy ships.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=378\u2013379, 609}}{{sfn|Forbes|1959|pp=86\u201387}} The ''cheirosiph\u014dnes'' especially were prescribed for use at land and in sieges, both against [[siege machines]] and against defenders on the walls, by several 10th-century military authors, and their use is depicted in the ''[[Poliorcetica]]'' of [[Hero of Byzantium]].{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=617\u2013619}}{{sfn|Haldon|2006|p=295}} The Byzantine [[dromon]]s usually had a ''siph\u014dn'' installed on their prow under the forecastle, but additional devices could also on occasion be placed elsewhere on the ship.

Anna Komnene gives this account of beast-shaped Greek fire projectors being mounted to the bow of warships:{{sfn|Dawes|1928|p=292}}\n<blockquote>As he [the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]]] knew that the [[Pisa]]ns were skilled in sea warfare and dreaded a battle with them, on the prow of each ship he had a head fixed of a lion or other land-animal, made in brass or iron with the mouth open and then gilded over, so that their mere aspect was terrifying. And the fire which was to be directed against the enemy through tubes he made to pass through the mouths of the beasts, so that it seemed as if the lions and the other similar monsters were vomiting the fire.</blockquote>\n\nSome sources provide more information on the composition and function of the whole mechanism. The Wolfenb\u00fcttel manuscript in particular provides the following description:{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=614\u2013616}}\n<blockquote>...having built a furnace right at the front of the ship, they set on it a copper vessel full of these things, having put fire underneath. And one of them, having made a bronze tube similar to that which the rustics call a ''squitiatoria'', \"squirt,\" with which boys play, they spray [it] at the enemy.</blockquote>\n\nAnother, possibly first-hand, account of the use of Greek fire comes from the 11th-century ''[[Yngvars saga v\u00ed\u00f0f\u00f6rla]]'', in which the [[Viking]] [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] faces ships equipped with Greek fire weapons:{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=616\u2013617}}\n<blockquote>[They] began blowing with smiths\u2019 bellows at a furnace in which there was fire and there came from it a great din. There stood there also a brass [or bronze] tube and from it flew much fire against one ship, and it burned up in a short time so that all of it became white ashes...</blockquote>\nThe account, albeit embellished, corresponds with many of the characteristics of Greek fire known from other sources, such as a loud roar that accompanied its discharge.{{sfn|Ellis Davidson|1973|p=72}} These two texts are also the only two sources that explicitly mention that the substance was heated over a furnace before being discharged; although the validity of this information is open to question, modern reconstructions have relied upon them.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=628\u2013629}}{{sfn|Haldon|2006|p=315}}\n\n[[File:Greek Fire mechanism after Haldon and Byrne.jpg|thumb|left|Proposed reconstruction of the Greek fire mechanism by Haldon and Byrne]]\nBased on these descriptions and the Byzantine sources, John Haldon and Maurice Byrne designed a hypothetical apparatus as consisting of three main components: a bronze pump, which was used to pressurize the oil; a brazier, used to heat the oil (\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, ''propyron'', \"pre-heater\"); and the nozzle, which was covered in bronze and mounted on a swivel (\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, ''strepton'').{{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=93}} The brazier, burning a match of linen or flax that produced intense heat and the characteristic thick smoke, was used to heat oil and the other ingredients in an airtight tank above it,{{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=94}} a process that also helped to dissolve the resins into a fluid mixture.{{sfn|Haldon|2006|p=310}} The substance was pressurized by the heat and the usage of a force pump. After it had reached the proper pressure, a valve connecting the tank with the swivel was opened and the mixture was discharged from its end, being ignited at its mouth by some source of flame.{{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=95}} The intense heat of the flame made necessary the presence of heat shields made of iron (\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1, ''boukolia''), which are attested in the fleet inventories.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=624\u2013626}}\n\nThe process of operating Haldon and Byrne's design was fraught with danger, as the mounting pressure could easily make the heated oil tank explode, a flaw which was not recorded as a problem with the historical fire weapon.{{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=96}}{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=627\u2013628}} In the experiments conducted by Haldon in 2002 for the episode \"Fireship\" of the television series ''Machines Times Forgot'', even modern welding techniques failed to secure adequate insulation of the bronze tank under pressure. This led to the relocation of the pressure pump between the tank and the nozzle. The full-scale device built on this basis established the effectiveness of the mechanism's design, even with the simple materials and techniques available to the Byzantines. The experiment used crude oil mixed with wood resins, and achieved a flame temperature of over {{convert|1000|C}} and an effective range of up to {{convert|15|m|sp=us}}.<ref>For a detailed description, cf. {{harvnb|Haldon|2006|pp=297\u2013315}} An interesting characteristic displayed during these tests was that, contrary to expectations due to the flame's heat, the stream of fire projected through the tube did not curve upwards but downwards, as the fuel was not completely vaporized as it left the nozzle. This fact is important because medieval galleys had a low profile, and a high-arcing flame would miss them entirely.{{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=621}}</ref>\n\n===Hand-held projectors===\n[[File:Hand-siphon for Greek fire, medieval illumination (detail).jpg|thumb|Detail of a ''cheirosiph\u014dn'']]\nThe portable ''cheirosiph\u014dn'' (\"hand-''siph\u014dn''\"), the earliest analogue to a modern [[flamethrower]], is extensively attested in the military documents of the 10th century, and recommended for use in both sea and land. They first appear in the ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactica]]'' of emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]], who claims to have invented them.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=617}} Subsequent authors continued to refer to the ''cheirosiph\u014dnes'', especially for use against [[siege towers]], although [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] also advises their use in field armies, with the aim of disrupting the enemy formation.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=617\u2013619}} Although both Leo VI and Nikephoros Phokas claim that the substance used in the ''cheirosiph\u014dnes'' was the same as in the static devices used on ships, Haldon and Byrne consider that the former were manifestly different from their larger cousins, and theorize that the device was fundamentally different, \"a simple syringe [that] squirted both liquid fire (presumably unignited) and noxious juices to repel enemy troops.\" The illustrations of Hero's ''Poliorcetica'' show the ''cheirosiph\u014dn'' also throwing the ignited substance, {{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=97}}{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=627}} but such illustrations were ''narrative'' in intent, so that showing the device throwing the ignited substance may have seemed preferable to trying to clearly illustrate throwing the unignited substance and then igniting it.\n\n===Grenades===\n[[Image:Liquid fire granades Chania.jpg|thumb|Ceramic grenades that were filled with Greek fire, surrounded by [[caltrop]]s, 10th\u201312th century, [[National Historical Museum (Greece)|National Historical Museum]], Athens, Greece]]\nIn its earliest form, Greek fire was hurled onto enemy forces by firing a burning cloth-wrapped ball, perhaps containing a flask, using a form of [[Catapult|light catapult]], most probably a seaborne variant of the Roman light catapult or [[onager (siege weapon)|onager]]. These were capable of hurling light loads, around {{convert|6|to|9|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, a distance of {{convert|350|-|450|m|yd|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Effectiveness and countermeasures==\nAlthough the destructiveness of Greek fire is indisputable, it did not make the [[Byzantine navy]] invincible. It was not, in the words of naval historian John Pryor, a \"ship-killer\" comparable to the [[naval ram]], which, by then, had fallen out of use.{{sfn|Pryor|2003|p=97}} While Greek fire remained a potent weapon, its limitations were significant when compared to more traditional forms of artillery: in its ''siph\u014dn''-deployed version, it had a limited range, and it could be used safely only in a calm sea and with favourable wind conditions.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=384}}\n\nThe Muslim navies eventually adapted themselves to it by staying out of its effective range and devising methods of protection such as felt or hides soaked in vinegar.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=617}}\n\n==In literature==\nIn [[C. J. Sansom]]'s historical mystery novel ''[[Dark Fire (Sansom novel)|Dark Fire]]'', [[Thomas Cromwell]] sends the lawyer [[Matthew Shardlake]] to recover the secret of Greek fire, following its discovery in the library of a dissolved London monastery.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview22 A wherry across the Thames] The Guardian, 6 November 2004.</ref>\n\nIn [[Michael Crichton]]'s sci-fi novel ''[[Timeline (novel) |Timeline]]'', [[Timeline (novel)#Professor Edward Johnston|Professor Edward Johnston]] is stuck in the past in 14th century Europe, and claims to have knowledge of Greek fire.\n\nIn [[Mika Waltari]]'s novel ''[[The Dark Angel (novel) |The Dark Angel]]'', some old men who are the last ones who know the secret of Greek fire are mentioned as present in the last Christian services held in [[Hagia Sophia]] before the [[Fall of Constantinople]].  The narrator is told that in the event of the city's fall, they will be killed so as to keep the secret from the Turks.\n\nIn [[George R. R. Martin]]'s fantasy series of novels ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', and its adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', Wildfire is similar to Greek fire, it was used in naval battles as it could remain lit on water and it was an extremely secretive recipe and was protected immensely.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fire ship]]\n*[[List of Byzantine inventions]]\n*[[List of flamethrowers]]\n*[[Napalm]]\n*[[Thermobaric weapon]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n |last = al-Hassan\n |first = A.

According to its preamble, its purpose was the \"substantial reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers and the elimination of preferences, on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis.\"\n\nIt was first discussed during the [[United Nations]] Conference on Trade and Employment and was the outcome of the failure of negotiating governments to create the [[International Trade Organization]] (ITO). GATT was signed by 23 nations in Geneva on 30 October 1947, and took effect on 1 January 1948. It remained in effect until the signature by 123 nations in Marrakesh on 14 April 1994, of the Uruguay Round Agreements, which established the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on 1 January 1995. The WTO is a successor to GATT, and the original GATT text (GATT 1947) is still in effect under the WTO framework, subject to the modifications of GATT 1994.<ref>World Trade Organization: [http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/legal_e.htm#GATT94 WTO legal texts]; [http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/06-gatt_e.htm General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994]</ref>\n\nGATT, and its successor WTO, have successfully reduced tariffs.

Twenty-six countries took part in the round. $2.5 billion in tariffs were eliminated or reduced.\n\n===Dillon Round: 1960\u201362===\nThe fifth round occurred once more in [[Geneva]] and lasted from 1960-1962. The talks were named after U.S. Treasury Secretary and former Under Secretary of State, [[Douglas Dillon]], who first proposed the talks. Twenty-six countries took part in the round. Along with reducing over $4.9 billion in tariffs, it also yielded discussion relating to the creation of the [[European Economic Community]] ([[European Community|EEC]]).\n\n===Kennedy Round: 1962\u201367===\n{{main|Kennedy Round}}\nThe sixth round of GATT multilateral trade negotiations, held from 1963 to 1967. It was named after U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] in recognition of his support for the reformulation of the United States trade agenda, which resulted in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This Act gave the President the widest-ever negotiating authority.\n\nAs the Dillon Round went through the laborious process of item-by-item tariff negotiations, it became clear, long before the Round ended, that a more comprehensive approach was needed to deal with the emerging challenges resulting from the formation of the European Economic Community (EEC) and EFTA, as well as Europe's re-emergence as a significant international trader more generally.\n\nJapan's high economic growth rate portended the major role it would play later as an exporter, but the focal point of the Kennedy Round always was the United States-EEC relationship. Indeed, there was an influential American view that saw what became the Kennedy Round as the start of a transatlantic partnership that might ultimately lead to a transatlantic economic community.\n\nTo an extent, this view was shared in Europe, but the process of European unification created its own stresses under which the Kennedy Round at times became a secondary focus for the EEC. An example of this was the French veto in January 1963, before the round had even started, on membership by the United Kingdom.\n\nAnother was the internal crisis of 1965, which ended in the Luxembourg Compromise. Preparations for the new round were immediately overshadowed by the Chicken War, an early sign of the impact variable levies under the Common Agricultural Policy would eventually have. Some participants in the Round had been concerned that the convening of UNCTAD, scheduled for 1964, would result in further complications, but its impact on the actual negotiations was minimal.\n\n'''In May 1963 Ministers reached agreement on three negotiating objectives for the round''':\n\n(a) Measures for the expansion of trade of developing countries as a means of furthering their economic development,\n\n(b) Reduction or elimination of tariffs and other barriers to trade, and\n\n(c) Measures for access to markets for agricultural and other primary products.\n\nThe working hypothesis for the tariff negotiations was a linear tariff cut of 50% with the smallest number of exceptions. A drawn-out argument developed about the trade effects a uniform linear cut would have on the dispersed rates (low and high tariffs quite far apart) of the United States as compared to the much more concentrated rates of the EEC which also tended to be in the lower held of United States tariff rates.\n\nThe EEC accordingly argued for an evening-out or harmonization of peaks and troughs through its cerement, double cart and thirty: ten proposals. Once negotiations had been joined, the lofty working hypothesis was soon undermined. The special-structure countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa), so called because their exports were dominated by raw materials and other primary commodities, negotiated their tariff reductions entirely through the item-by-item method.\n\nIn the end, the result was an average 35% reduction in tariffs, except for textiles, chemicals, steel and other sensitive products; plus a 15% to 18% reduction in tariffs for agricultural and food products. In addition, the negotiations on chemicals led to a provisional agreement on the abolition of the American Selling Price (ASP). This was a method of valuing some chemicals used by the noted States for the imposition of import duties which gave domestic manufacturers a much higher level of protection than the tariff schedule indicated.\n\nHowever, this part of the outcome was disallowed by Congress, and the American Selling Price was not abolished until Congress adopted the results of the Tokyo Round. The results on agriculture overall were poor. The most notable achievement was agreement on a Memorandum of Agreement on Basic Elements for the Negotiation of a World Grants Arrangement, which eventually was rolled into a new International Grains Arrangement.\n\nThe EEC claimed that for it the main result of the negotiations on agriculture was that they \"greatly helped to define its own common policy\". The developing countries, who played a minor role throughout the negotiations in this Round, benefited nonetheless from substantial tariff cuts particularly in non-agricultural items of interest to them.\n\nTheir main achievement at the time, however, was seen to be the adoption of Part IV of the GATT, which absolved them from according reciprocity to developed countries in trade negotiations. In the view of many developing countries, this was a direct result of the call at UNCTAD I for a better trade deal for them.\n\nThere has been argument ever since whether this symbolic gesture was a victory for them, or whether it ensured their exclusion in the future from meaningful participation in the multilateral trading system. On the other hand, there was no doubt that the extension of the Long-Term Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles, which later became the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, for three years until 1970 led to the longer-term impairment of export opportunities for developing countries.\n\nAnother outcome of the Kennedy Round was the adoption of an Anti-dumping Code, which gave more precise guidance on the implementation of Article VI of the GATT. In particular, it sought to ensure speedy and fair investigations, and it imposed limits on the retrospective application of anti-dumping measures.\n\n[[Kennedy Round]] took place from 1962\u20131967. $40 billion in tariffs were eliminated or reduced.\n\n===Tokyo Round: 1973\u201379===\nReduced tariffs and established new regulations aimed at controlling the proliferation of non-tariff barriers and voluntary export restrictions. 102 countries took part in the round. Concessions were made on $19 billion worth.\n\n===Uruguay Round: 1986\u201394===\n{{Main|Uruguay Round}}\nThe [[Uruguay Round]] began in 1986. It was the most ambitious round to date, hoping to expand the competence of the GATT to important new areas such as [[service (economics)|services]], [[capital (economics)|capital]], [[intellectual property]], [[textiles]], and [[agriculture]]. 123 countries took part in the round. The [[Uruguay Round]] was also the first set of multilateral trade negotiations in which developing countries had played an active role.<ref>{{cite web|title=The GATT Uruguay Round|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5443&title=gatt-uruguay-round-ldcs|work=ODI briefing paper|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=28 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803075541/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5443&title=gatt-uruguay-round-ldcs|archive-date=3 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAgriculture was essentially exempted from previous agreements as it was given special status in the areas of [[import quota]]s and [[export subsidies]], with only mild caveats. However, by the time of the Uruguay round, many countries considered the exception of agriculture to be sufficiently glaring that they refused to sign a new deal without some movement on agricultural products. These fourteen countries came to be known as the \"[[Cairns Group]]\", and included mostly small and medium-sized agricultural exporters such as [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Indonesia]], and [[New Zealand]].\n\nThe Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round continues to be the most substantial [[trade liberalization]] agreement in agricultural products in the history of trade negotiations. The goals of the agreement were to improve market access for agricultural products, reduce domestic support of agriculture in the form of price-distorting [[subsidies]] and quotas, eliminate over time export subsidies on agricultural products and to harmonize to the extent possible sanitary and phytosanitary measures between member countries.\n\n==GATT and the World Trade Organization==\n{{Main|Uruguay Round}}\n\nIn 1993, the GATT was updated (''GATT 1994'') to include new obligations upon its signatories. One of the most significant changes was the creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). The 75 existing GATT members and the [[European Communities]] became the founding members of the WTO on 1 January 1995. The other 52 GATT members rejoined the WTO in the following two years (the last being [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]] in 1997). Since the founding of the WTO, 21 new non-GATT members have joined and 29 are currently negotiating membership. There are a total of [[Member states of the World Trade Organization|164 member countries in the WTO]], with [[Liberia]] and [[Afghanistan]] being the newest members as of 2016.\n\nOf the original GATT members, [[Syria]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min96_e/chrono.htm |title=Fiftieth Anniversary GATT |publisher=Wto.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm |title=Understanding the WTO - members |publisher=WTO |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> and the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] have not rejoined the WTO.

[[Montenegro]] became a member in 2012, while [[Serbia]] is in the decision stage of the negotiations and is expected to become a member of the WTO in the future.\n\nWhilst GATT was a set of rules agreed upon by nations, the WTO is an institutional body. As such, GATT was merely a forum for nations to discuss, while the WTO is a proper international organization (which implies physical headquarters, staff, delegation ...). The WTO expanded its scope from traded goods to include trade within the [[service sector]] and [[Intellectual Property Rights|intellectual property rights]]. Although it was designed to serve multilateral agreements, during several rounds of GATT negotiations (particularly the [[Tokyo]] Round) [[plurilateral]] agreements created selective trading and caused fragmentation among members.

The GPCR arranges itself into a [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] resembling a barrel, with the seven transmembrane helices forming a cavity within the plasma membrane that serves a [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-binding domain that is often covered by EL-2. Ligands may also bind elsewhere, however, as is the case for bulkier ligands (e.g., [[protein]]s or large [[peptide]]s), which instead interact with the extracellular loops, or, as illustrated by the class C [[metabotropic glutamate receptors]] (mGluRs), the N-terminal tail. The class C GPCRs are distinguished by their large N-terminal tail, which also contains a ligand-binding domain. Upon glutamate-binding to an mGluR, the N-terminal tail undergoes a conformational change that leads to its interaction with the residues of the extracellular loops and TM domains. The eventual effect of all three types of [[agonist]]-induced activation is a change in the relative orientations of the TM helices (likened to a twisting motion) leading to a wider intracellular surface and \"revelation\" of residues of the intracellular helices and TM domains crucial to signal transduction function (i.e., G-protein coupling). [[Inverse agonist]]s and [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]s may also bind to a number of different sites, but the eventual effect must be prevention of this TM helix reorientation.<ref name=trz/>\n\nThe structure of the N- and C-terminal tails of GPCRs may also serve important functions beyond ligand-binding. For example, The C-terminus of M<sub>3</sub> muscarinic receptors is sufficient, and the six-amino-acid polybasic (KKKRRK) domain in the C-terminus is necessary for its preassembly with G<sub>q</sub> proteins.<ref name=\" pmid=21873996 \">{{cite journal |vauthors= Qin K, Dong C, Wu G, Lambert NA |title= Inactive-state preassembly of G(q)-coupled receptors and G(q) heterotrimers |journal= Nature Chemical Biology |volume= 7 |issue= 10 |pages= 740\u20137 |date= October 2011 |pmid= 21873996 |doi= 10.1038/nchembio.642 |pmc= 3177959}}</ref> In particular, the C-terminus often contains [[serine]] (Ser) or [[threonine]] (Thr) residues that, when [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]], increase the [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] of the intracellular surface for the binding of scaffolding proteins called \u03b2-[[arrestin]]s (\u03b2-arr).<ref name=\"pmid2163110\">{{cite journal |vauthors= Lohse MJ, Benovic JL, Codina J, Caron MG, Lefkowitz RJ |title= beta-Arrestin: a protein that regulates beta-adrenergic receptor function |journal= Science |volume= 248 |issue= 4962 |pages= 1547\u201350 |date= June 1990 |pmid= 2163110 |doi= 10.1126/science.2163110}}</ref> Once bound, \u03b2-arrestins both [[sterically]] prevent G-protein coupling and may recruit other proteins, leading to the creation of signaling complexes involved in extracellular-signal regulated kinase ([[extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]]) pathway activation or receptor [[endocytosis]] (internalization).

Palmitoylation is the covalent modification of [[cysteine]] (Cys) residues via addition of hydrophobic [[acyl group]]s, and has the effect of targeting the receptor to [[cholesterol]]- and [[sphingolipid]]-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane called [[lipid raft]]s. As many of the downstream transducer and effector molecules of GPCRs (including those involved in [[negative feedback]] pathways) are also targeted to lipid rafts, this has the effect of facilitating rapid receptor signaling.\n\nGPCRs respond to extracellular signals mediated by a huge diversity of agonists, ranging from proteins to [[biogenic amines]] to [[protons]], but all transduce this signal via a mechanism of G-protein coupling. This is made possible by a [[guanine]]-nucleotide exchange factor ([[guanine nucleotide exchange factor|GEF]]) domain primarily formed by a combination of IL-2 and IL-3 along with adjacent residues of the associated TM helices.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:GPCR activation.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Cartoon depicting the basic concept of GPCR conformational activation.

It is not yet known how exactly the active and inactive states differ from each other.\n\n===G-protein activation/deactivation cycle===\n[[File:GPCR cycle.jpg|thumb|500px|Cartoon depicting the Heterotrimeric G-protein activation/deactivation cycle in the context of GPCR signaling]]\n{{See also|G protein}}\nWhen the receptor is inactive, the [[guanine nucleotide exchange factor|GEF]] domain may be bound to an also inactive \u03b1-subunit of a [[heterotrimeric G-protein]]. These \"G-proteins\" are a [[protein trimer|trimer]] of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits (known as G\u03b1, G\u03b2, and G\u03b3, respectively) that is rendered inactive when reversibly bound to [[Guanosine diphosphate]] (GDP) (or, alternatively, no guanine nucleotide) but active when bound to [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP). Upon receptor activation, the GEF domain, in turn, [[allosterically]] activates the G-protein by facilitating the exchange of a molecule of GDP for GTP at the G-protein's \u03b1-subunit. The cell maintains a 10:1 ratio of cytosolic GTP:GDP so exchange for GTP is ensured. At this point, the subunits of the G-protein dissociate from the receptor, as well as each other, to yield a G\u03b1-GTP [[monomer]] and a tightly interacting [[G beta-gamma complex|G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer]], which are now free to modulate the activity of other intracellular proteins. The extent to which they may [[diffuse]], however, is limited due to the [[palmitoylation]] of G\u03b1 and the presence of an [[isoprenoid]] moiety that has been [[covalent bond|covalently]] added to the C-termini of G\u03b3.\n\nBecause G\u03b1 also has slow [[GTP-ase|GTP\u2192GDP hydrolysis]] capability, the inactive form of the \u03b1-subunit (G\u03b1-GDP) is eventually regenerated, thus allowing reassociation with a G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer to form the \"resting\" G-protein, which can again bind to a GPCR and await activation. The rate of GTP hydrolysis is often accelerated due to the actions of another family of allosteric modulating proteins called [[regulator of G protein signaling|Regulators of G-protein Signaling]], or RGS proteins, which are a type of [[GTPase activating protein|GTPase-Activating Protein]], or GAP. In fact, many of the primary [[Effector (biology)|effector]] proteins (e.g., [[adenylate cyclase]]s) that become activated/inactivated upon interaction with G\u03b1-GTP also have GAP activity. Thus, even at this early stage in the process, GPCR-initiated signaling has the capacity for self-termination.\n\n===Crosstalk===\n[[File:GPCR and itegrin signaling diagram.png|thumb|Proposed downstream interactions between [[integrin]] signaling and GPCRs.

Some evidence suggests that receptors and G proteins are actually pre-coupled.<ref name=\" pmid=21873996 \"/> For example, binding of G proteins to receptors affects the receptor's affinity for ligands. Activated G proteins are bound to [[guanosine triphosphate|GTP]].\n\nFurther signal transduction depends on the type of G protein. The enzyme [[adenylate cyclase]] is an example of a cellular protein that can be regulated by a G protein, in this case the G protein [[Gs alpha subunit|G<sub>s</sub>]]. Adenylate cyclase activity is activated when it binds to a subunit of the activated G protein. Activation of adenylate cyclase ends when the G protein returns to the [[guanosine diphosphate|GDP]]-bound state.\n\nAdenylate cyclases (of which 9 membrane-bound and one cytosolic forms are known in humans) may also be activated or inhibited in other ways (e.g., Ca2+/[[Calmodulin]] binding), which can modify the activity of these enzymes in an additive or synergistic fashion along with the G proteins.\n\nThe signaling pathways activated through a GPCR are limited by the [[protein primary structure|primary sequence]] and [[tertiary structure]] of the GPCR itself but ultimately determined by the particular [[protein conformation|conformation]] stabilized by a particular [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]], as well as the availability of [[transducer]] molecules. Currently, GPCRs are considered to utilize two primary types of transducers: [[G-proteins]] and [[arrestin|\u03b2-arrestins]]. Because \u03b2-arr's have high [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] only to the [[phosphorylated]] form of most GPCRs (see above or below), the majority of signaling is ultimately dependent upon G-protein activation. However, the possibility for interaction does allow for G-protein-independent signaling to occur.\n\n===G-protein-dependent signaling===\n\nThere are three main G-protein-mediated signaling pathways, mediated by four [[class (biology)|sub-classes]] of G-proteins distinguished from each other by [[sequence homology]] ([[G\u03b1s|G<sub>\u03b1s</sub>]], [[G\u03b1i|G<sub>\u03b1i/o</sub>]], [[G\u03b1q|G<sub>\u03b1q/11</sub>]], and [[G12/G13 alpha subunits|G<sub>\u03b112/13</sub>]]). Each sub-class of G-protein consists of multiple proteins, each the product of multiple [[genes]] or [[splice variant|splice variations]] that may imbue them with differences ranging from subtle to distinct with regard to signaling properties, but in general they appear reasonably grouped into four classes. Because the signal transducing properties of the various possible [[G beta-gamma complex|\u03b2\u03b3 combinations]] do not appear to radically differ from one another, these classes are defined according to the isoform of their \u03b1-subunit.<ref name=\"Wettschureck_2005\"/>{{rp|1163}}\n\nWhile most GPCRs are capable of activating more than one G\u03b1-subtype, they also show a preference for one subtype over another. When the subtype activated depends on the ligand that is bound to the GPCR, this is called [[functional selectivity]] (also known as agonist-directed trafficking, or conformation-specific agonism). However, the binding of any single particular [[agonist]] may also initiate activation of multiple different G-proteins, as it may be capable of stabilizing more than one conformation of the GPCR's [[guanine nucleotide exchange factor|GEF]] domain, even over the course of a single interaction. In addition, a conformation that preferably activates one [[isoform]] of G\u03b1 may activate another if the preferred is less available. Furthermore, [[feedback]] pathways may result in [[post-translational modification|receptor modifications]] (e.g., phosphorylation) that alter the G-protein preference. Regardless of these various nuances, the GPCR's preferred coupling partner is usually defined according to the G-protein most obviously activated by the [[endogenous]] ligand under most [[physiological]] or [[experimental]] conditions.\n\n====G\u03b1 signaling====\n\n# The effector of both the G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> and G<sub>\u03b1i/o</sub> pathways is the [[cyclic amp|cyclic-adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP)-generating enzyme [[adenylyl cyclase|adenylate cyclase]], or AC. While there are ten different AC gene products in mammals, each with subtle differences in [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] distribution or function, all [[catalyze]] the conversion of [[cytosolic]] [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) to cAMP, and all are directly stimulated by G-proteins of the G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> class. In contrast, however, interaction with G\u03b1 subunits of the G<sub>\u03b1i/o</sub> type inhibits AC from generating cAMP. Thus, a GPCR coupled to G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> counteracts the actions of a GPCR coupled to G<sub>\u03b1i/o</sub>, and vice versa. The level of cytosolic cAMP may then determine the activity of various [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel|ion channels]] as well as members of the [[Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase|ser/thr-specific]] [[protein kinase A]] (PKA) family. Thus cAMP is considered a [[second messenger system|second messenger]] and PKA a secondary [[effector (biology)|effector]].\n# The effector of the G<sub>\u03b1q/11</sub> pathway is [[phospholipase C|phospholipase C-\u03b2]] (PLC\u03b2), which catalyzes the cleavage of membrane-bound [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] (PIP2) into the second messengers [[inositol trisphosphate|inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate]] (IP3) and [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]] (DAG). IP3 acts on [[inositol trisphosphate receptor|IP3 receptors]] found in the membrane of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) to elicit [[Ca2+|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] release from the ER, while DAG diffuses along the [[plasma membrane]] where it may activate any membrane localized forms of a second ser/thr kinase called [[protein kinase C]] (PKC). Since many isoforms of PKC are also activated by increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, both these pathways can also converge on each other to signal through the same secondary effector. Elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> also binds and [[allosterically]] activates proteins called [[calmodulin]]s, which in turn go on to bind and allosterically activate enzymes such as [[Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase|Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinases]] (CAMKs).\n# The effectors of the G<sub>\u03b112/13</sub> pathway are three [[RhoGEF domain|RhoGEFs]] (p115-RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG), which, when bound to G<sub>\u03b112/13</sub> allosterically activate the cytosolic [[small GTPase]], [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]]. Once bound to GTP, Rho can then go on to activate various proteins responsible for [[cytoskeleton]] regulation such as [[Rho-associated protein kinase|Rho-kinase]] (ROCK). Most GPCRs that couple to G<sub>\u03b112/13</sub> also couple to other sub-classes, often G<sub>\u03b1q/11</sub>.\n\n====G\u03b2\u03b3 signaling====\n\nThe above descriptions ignore the effects of [[G beta-gamma complex|G\u03b2\u03b3]]\u2013signalling, which can also be important, in particular in the case of activated G<sub>\u03b1i/o</sub>-coupled GPCRs. The primary effectors of G\u03b2\u03b3 are various ion channels, such as [[G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel|G-protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels]] (GIRKs), [[P-type calcium channel|P]]/[[Q-type calcium channel|Q]]- and [[N-type calcium channel|N-]]type [[voltage-dependent calcium channel|voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels]], as well as some isoforms of AC and PLC, along with some [[PI3K|phosphoinositide-3-kinase]] (PI3K) isoforms.\n\n===G-protein-independent signaling===\n\nAlthough they are classically thought of working only together, GPCRs may signal through G-protein-independent mechanisms, and heterotrimeric G-proteins may play functional roles independent of GPCRs. GPCRs may signal independently through many proteins already mentioned for their roles in G-protein-dependent signaling such as [[arrestin|\u03b2-arrs]], [[G protein-coupled receptor kinase|GRKs]], and [[Src (gene)|Srcs]]. In addition, further scaffolding proteins involved in [[subcellular localization]] of GPCRs (e.g., [[PDZ (biology)|PDZ-domain]]-containing proteins) may also act as signal transducers. Most often the effector is a member of the [[MAPK]] family.\n\n====Examples====\n\nIn the late 1990s, evidence began accumulating to suggest that some GPCRs are able to signal without G proteins. The [[MAPK1|ERK2]] mitogen-activated protein kinase, a key signal transduction mediator downstream of receptor activation in many pathways, has been shown to be activated in response to cAMP-mediated receptor activation in the [[slime mold]] [[Dictyostelium discoideum|''D. discoideum'']] despite the absence of the associated G protein \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Kim JY, Haastert PV, Devreotes PN |title= Social senses: G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways in Dictyostelium discoideum |journal= Chemistry & Biology |volume= 3 |issue= 4 |pages= 239\u201343 |date= April 1996 |pmid= 8807851 |doi= 10.1016/S1074-5521(96)90103-9 |url= http://www.cell.com/chemistry-biology/retrieve/pii/S1074552196901039}}</ref>\n\nIn mammalian cells, the much-studied \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor has been demonstrated to activate the ERK2 pathway after arrestin-mediated uncoupling of G-protein-mediated signaling. Therefore, it seems likely that some mechanisms previously believed related purely to receptor desensitisation are actually examples of receptors switching their signaling pathway, rather than simply being switched off.\n\nIn kidney cells, the [[bradykinin receptor B2]] has been shown to interact directly with a protein tyrosine phosphatase. The presence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated [[immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif|ITIM]] (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) sequence in the B2 receptor is necessary to mediate this interaction and subsequently the antiproliferative effect of bradykinin.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Duchene J, Schanstra JP, Pecher C, Pizard A, Susini C, Esteve JP, Bascands JL, Girolami JP |title= A novel protein-protein interaction between a G protein-coupled receptor and the phosphatase SHP-2 is involved in bradykinin-induced inhibition of cell proliferation |journal= The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume= 277 |issue= 43 |pages= 40375\u201383 |date= October 2002 |pmid= 12177051 |doi= 10.1074/jbc.M202744200}}</ref>\n\n====GPCR-independent signaling by heterotrimeric G-proteins====\n\nAlthough it is a relatively immature area of research, it appears that heterotrimeric G-proteins may also take part in non-GPCR signaling. There is evidence for roles as signal transducers in nearly all other types of receptor-mediated signaling, including [[integrins]], [[receptor tyrosine kinases]] (RTKs), [[cytokine receptors]] ([[JAK-STAT signaling pathway|JAK/STATs]]), as well as modulation of various other \"accessory\" proteins such as [[guanine nucleotide exchange factor|GEFs]], [[guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors|guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitors]] (GDIs) and [[protein phosphatases]]. There may even be specific proteins of these classes whose primary function is as part of GPCR-independent pathways, termed activators of G-protein signalling (AGS). Both the ubiquity of these interactions and the importance of G\u03b1 vs. G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits to these processes are still unclear.\n\n==Details of cAMP and PIP2 pathways==\n[[File:Proteinkinase 1.svg|thumb|250px|Activation effects of cAMP on protein kinase A]]\n[[File:The effect of Rs and Gs in cAMP signal pathway.jpg|thumb|250px|The effect of Rs and Gs in cAMP signal pathway]]\n[[File:The effect of Ri and Gi in cAMP signal pathway.jpg|thumb|250px|The effect of Ri and Gi in cAMP signal pathway]]\nThere are two principal signal transduction pathways involving the [[G protein-coupled receptors|G protein-linked receptors]]: the [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] signal pathway and the [[phosphatidylinositol]] signal pathway.<ref name=\"Gilman_1987\"/>\n\n===cAMP signal pathway===\n\n{{Main|cAMP-dependent pathway}}\nThe cAMP signal transduction contains 5 main characters: stimulative [[hormone]] receptor (Rs) or inhibitory [[hormone receptor]] (Ri); stimulative regulative G-protein (Gs) or inhibitory regulative G-protein (Gi); [[adenylyl cyclase]]; [[protein kinase A]] (PKA); and cAMP [[phosphodiesterase]].\n\nStimulative hormone receptor (Rs) is a receptor that can bind with stimulative signal molecules, while inhibitory hormone receptor (Ri) is a receptor that can bind with inhibitory signal molecules.\n\nStimulative regulative G-protein is a G-protein linked to stimulative hormone receptor (Rs), and its \u03b1 subunit upon activation could stimulate the activity of an enzyme or other intracellular metabolism. On the contrary, inhibitory regulative G-protein is linked to an inhibitory hormone receptor, and its \u03b1 subunit upon activation could inhibit the activity of an enzyme or other intracellular metabolism.\n\nAdenylyl cyclase is a 12-transmembrane glycoprotein that catalyzes ATP to form cAMP with the help of cofactor Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>. The cAMP produced is a second messenger in cellular metabolism and is an allosteric activator of protein kinase A.\n\nProtein kinase A is an important enzyme in cell metabolism due to its ability to regulate cell metabolism by phosphorylating specific committed enzymes in the metabolic pathway. It can also regulate specific gene expression, cellular secretion, and membrane permeability. The protein enzyme contains two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits. When there is no cAMP\uff0cthe complex is inactive. When cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits, their conformation is altered, causing the dissociation of the regulatory subunits, which activates protein kinase A and allows further biological effects.\n\nThese signals then can be terminated by cAMP phosphodiesterase, which is an enzyme that degrades cAMP to 5'-AMP and inactivates protein kinase A.\n\n===Phosphatidylinositol signal pathway===\n\n{{Main|IP3/DAG pathway}}\nIn the [[phosphatidylinositol]] signal pathway, the extracellular signal molecule binds with the G-protein receptor (G<sub>q</sub>) on the cell surface and activates [[phospholipase C]], which is located on the [[cell membrane|plasma membrane]]. The [[lipase]] hydrolyzes [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] (PIP2) into two second messengers: [[inositol trisphosphate|inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)]] and [[diacylglycerol]] (DAG). IP3 binds with the [[IP3 receptor]] in the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to open Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. DAG helps activate [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), which phosphorylates many other proteins, changing their catalytic activities, leading to cellular responses.\n\nThe effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are also remarkable: it cooperates with DAG in activating PKC and can activate the [[Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase|CaM kinase]] pathway, in which calcium-modulated protein [[calmodulin]] (CaM) binds Ca<sup>2+</sup>, undergoes a change in conformation, and activates CaM kinase II, which has unique ability to increase its binding affinity to CaM by autophosphorylation, making CaM unavailable for the activation of other enzymes. The kinase then phosphorylates target enzymes, regulating their activities. The two signal pathways are connected together by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM, which is also a regulatory subunit of adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase in the cAMP signal pathway.\n\n==Receptor regulation==\n\nGPCRs become desensitized when exposed to their ligand for a long period of time. There are two recognized forms of desensitization: 1) [[homologous desensitization]], in which the activated GPCR is downregulated; and 2) [[heterologous desensitization]], wherein the activated GPCR causes downregulation of a different GPCR. The key reaction of this downregulation is the [[phosphorylation]] of the intracellular (or [[cytoplasm]]ic) receptor domain by [[protein kinase]]s.\n\n===Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases===\n\nCyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases ([[protein kinase A]]) are activated by the signal chain coming from the G protein (that was activated by the receptor) via [[adenylate cyclase]] and [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP). In a ''feedback mechanism'', these activated kinases phosphorylate the receptor. The longer the receptor remains active the more kinases are activated and the more receptors are phosphorylated. In [[beta-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor]]s, this phosphorylation results in the switching of the coupling from the G<sub>s</sub> class of G-protein to the [[Gi alpha subunit|G<sub>i</sub>]] class.<ref name=\"pmid11053129\">{{cite journal |vauthors= Chen-Izu Y, Xiao RP, Izu LT, Cheng H, Kuschel M, Spurgeon H, Lakatta EG |title= G(i)-dependent localization of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor signaling to L-type Ca(2+) channels |journal= Biophysical Journal |volume= 79 |issue= 5 |pages= 2547\u201356 |date= November 2000 |pmid= 11053129 |pmc= 1301137 |doi= 10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76495-2}}</ref> cAMP-dependent PKA mediated phosphorylation can cause heterologous desensitisation in receptors other than those activated.<ref name=\"pmid14744258\">{{cite journal |vauthors= Tan CM, Brady AE, Nickols HH, Wang Q, Limbird LE |title= Membrane trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors |journal= Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology |volume= 44 |issue= 1 |pages= 559\u2013609 |year= 2004 |pmid= 14744258 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.44.101802.121558}}</ref>\n\n===Phosphorylation by GRKs===\n\nThe [[G protein-coupled receptor kinases]] (GRKs) are protein kinases that phosphorylate only active GPCRs.<ref name=\"Trimarco2013\">{{cite journal |vauthors= Santulli G, Trimarco B, Iaccarino G |title= G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and hypertension: molecular insights and pathophysiological mechanisms |journal= High Blood Pressure & Cardiovascular Prevention |volume= 20 |issue= 1 |pages= 5\u201312 |date= March 2013 |pmid= 23532739 |doi= 10.1007/s40292-013-0001-8}}</ref> G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are key modulators of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling.

This mechanism is used to regulate long-term exposure, for example, to a hormone, by allowing resensitisation to follow desensitisation.

This mechanism is used, for example, with [[rhodopsin]] in [[retina]] cells to compensate for exposure to bright light. In many cases, arrestin's binding to the receptor is a prerequisite for translocation. For example, beta-arrestin bound to \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors acts as an adaptor for binding with clathrin, and with the beta-subunit of AP2 (clathrin adaptor molecules); thus, the arrestin here acts as a scaffold assembling the components needed for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors.<ref name=\"pmid10770944\">{{cite journal |vauthors= Laporte SA, Oakley RH, Holt JA, Barak LS, Caron MG |title= The interaction of beta-arrestin with the AP-2 adaptor is required for the clustering of beta 2-adrenergic receptor into clathrin-coated pits |journal= The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume= 275 |issue= 30 |pages= 23120\u20136 |date= July 2000 |pmid= 10770944 |doi= 10.1074/jbc.M002581200 |url= http://www.jbc.org/content/275/30/23120.full.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10097102\">{{cite journal |vauthors= Laporte SA, Oakley RH, Zhang J, Holt JA, Ferguson SS, Caron MG, Barak LS |title= The beta2-adrenergic receptor/betaarrestin complex recruits the clathrin adaptor AP-2 during endocytosis |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume= 96 |issue= 7 |pages= 3712\u20137 |date= March 1999 |pmid= 10097102 |pmc= 22359 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.96.7.3712}}</ref>\n\n===Mechanisms of GPCR signal termination===\n\nAs mentioned above, G-proteins may terminate their own activation due to their intrinsic [[GTPase|GTP\u2192GDP hydrolysis]] capability. However, this reaction proceeds at a slow [[rate constant|rate]] (\u2248.02 times/sec) and, thus, it would take around 50 seconds for any single G-protein to deactivate if other factors did not come into play. Indeed, there are around 30 [[protein isoform|isoforms]] of [[regulator of G protein signaling|RGS proteins]] that, when bound to G\u03b1 through their [[GTPase activating protein|GAP domain]], accelerate the hydrolysis rate to \u224830 times/sec. This 1500-fold increase in rate allows for the cell to respond to external signals with high speed, as well as spatial [[angular resolution|resolution]] due to limited amount of [[second messenger]] that can be generated and limited distance a G-protein can diffuse in 0.03 seconds. For the most part, the RGS proteins are [[promiscuous]] in their ability to activate G-proteins, while which RGS is involved in a given signaling pathway seems more determined by the tissue and GPCR involved than anything else. In addition, RGS proteins have the additional function of increasing the rate of GTP-GDP exchange at GPCRs, (i.e., as a sort of co-GEF) further contributing to the time resolution of GPCR signaling.\n\nIn addition, the GPCR may be [[homologous desensitization|desensitized]] itself. This can occur as:\n\n# a direct result of [[receptor theory|ligand occupation]], wherein the change in [[protein conformation|conformation]] allows recruitment of [[G protein-coupled receptor kinase|GPCR-Regulating Kinases]] (GRKs), which go on to [[phosphorylation|phosphorylate]] various [[serine]]/[[threonine]] residues of IL-3 and the [[C-terminal]] tail. Upon GRK phosphorylation, the GPCR's affinity for [[arrestin|\u03b2-arrestin]] (\u03b2-arrestin-1/2 in most tissues) is increased, at which point \u03b2-arrestin may bind and act to both [[sterically]] hinder G-protein coupling as well as initiate the process of [[receptor-mediated endocytosis|receptor internalization]] through [[clathrin-mediated endocytosis]]. Because only the liganded receptor is desensitized by this mechanism, it is called [[homologous desensitization]]\n# the affinity for \u03b2-arrestin may be increased in a ligand occupation and GRK-independent manner through phosphorylation of different ser/thr sites (but also of IL-3 and the C-terminal tail) by PKC and PKA. These phosphorylations are often sufficient to impair G-protein coupling on their own as well.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n# PKC/PKA may, instead, phosphorylate GRKs, which can also lead to GPCR phosphorylation and \u03b2-arrestin binding in an occupation-independent manner. These latter two mechanisms allow for desensitization of one GPCR due to the activities of others, or [[heterologous desensitization]]. GRKs may also have GAP domains and so may contribute to inactivation through non-[[kinase]] mechanisms as well. A combination of these mechanisms may also occur.\n\nOnce \u03b2-arrestin is bound to a GPCR, it undergoes a conformational change allowing it to serve as a scaffolding protein for an adaptor complex termed [[AP2 adaptors|AP-2]], which in turn recruits another protein called [[clathrin]]. If enough receptors in the local area recruit clathrin in this manner, they aggregate and the [[plasma membrane|membrane]] buds inwardly as a result of interactions between the molecules of clathrin, in a process called [[opsonization]]. Once the pit has been pinched off the [[plasma membrane]] due to the actions of two other proteins called [[amphiphysin]] and [[dynamin]], it is now an [[endocytosis|endocytic]] [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]. At this point, the adapter molecules and clathrin have [[dissociated]], and the receptor is either [[protein targeting|trafficked]] back to the plasma membrane or targeted to [[lysosome]]s for [[proteolysis|degradation]].\n\nAt any point in this process, the \u03b2-arrestins may also recruit other proteins\u2014such as the [[non-receptor tyrosine kinase]] (nRTK), [[Src (gene)|c-SRC]]\u2014which may activate [[extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK1/2]], or other [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] (MAPK) signaling through, for example, phosphorylation of the [[small GTPase]], [[Ras subfamily|Ras]], or recruit the proteins of the [[MAPK/ERK pathway|ERK cascade]] directly (i.e., [[Raf-1]], [[mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase|MEK]], ERK-1/2) at which point signaling is initiated due to their close proximity to one another. Another target of c-SRC are the dynamin molecules involved in endocytosis. Dynamins [[polymerization|polymerize]] around the neck of an incoming vesicle, and their phosphorylation by c-SRC provides the energy necessary for the conformational change allowing the final \"pinching off\" from the membrane.\n\n===GPCR cellular regulation===\nReceptor desensitization is mediated through a combination phosphorylation, \u03b2-arr binding, and endocytosis as described above. Downregulation occurs when endocytosed receptor is embedded in an endosome that is trafficked to merge with an organelle called a lysosome. Because lysosomal membranes are rich in proton pumps, their interiors have low pH (\u22484.8 vs. the pH\u22487.2 cytosol), which acts to denature the GPCRs. In addition, lysosomes contain many [[degradative enzyme]]s, including proteases, which can function only at such low pH, and so the peptide bonds joining the residues of the GPCR together may be cleaved. Whether or not a given receptor is trafficked to a lysosome, detained in endosomes, or trafficked back to the plasma membrane depends on a variety of factors, including receptor type and magnitude of the signal.\nGPCR regulation is additionally mediated by gene transcription factors. These factors can increase or decrease gene transcription and thus increase or decrease the generation of new receptors (up- or down-regulation) that travel to the cell membrane.\n\n==Receptor oligomerization==\n{{Main|GPCR oligomer}}\n\nG-protein-coupled receptor oligomerisation is a widespread phenomenon. One of the best-studied examples is the metabotropic [[GABAB receptor|GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor]]. This so-called constitutive receptor is formed by heterodimerization of [[GABBR1|GABA<sub>B</sub>R1]] and [[GABBR2|GABA<sub>B</sub>R2]] subunits. Expression of the GABA<sub>B</sub>R1 without the GABA<sub>B</sub>R2 in heterologous systems leads to retention of the subunit in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. Expression of the GABA<sub>B</sub>R2 subunit alone, meanwhile, leads to surface expression of the subunit, although with no functional activity (i.e., the receptor does not bind agonist and cannot initiate a response following exposure to agonist). Expression of the two subunits together leads to plasma membrane expression of functional receptor.

Most prominent among the regulatory GTPases are the G proteins.\n\n===GTP switch===\nAll regulatory GTPases have a common mechanism that enables them to switch a [[signal transduction]] chain on and off. Toggling the switch is performed by the unidirectional change of the GTPase from the ''active, [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]]-bound form'' to the ''inactive, [[guanosine diphosphate|GDP]]-bound form'' by [[hydrolysis]] of the GTP through intrinsic GTPase-activity, effectively switching the GTPase ''off''. This reaction is initiated by [[GTPase-activating protein]]s (GAPs), coming from another signal transduction pathway. It can be reversed (switching the GTPase ''on'' again) by [[Guanine nucleotide exchange factor]]s (GEFs), which cause the GDP to dissociate from the GTPase, leading to its association with a new GTP. This closes the cycle to the active state of the GTPase; the irreversible hydrolysis of the GTP to GDP forces the cycle to run only in one direction. Only the active state of the GTPase can transduce a signal to a reaction chain.\n\n===Switch regulation===\nThe efficiency of the signal transduction via a GTPase depends on the ratio of active to inactive GTPase. That equals:\n<!--\n:GTPase*GTP   k<sub>diss.GDP</sub> \n:<sup>__________</sup> = <sup>_________</sup> \n:GTPase*GDP   k<sub>cat.GTP</sub> \n-->\n:<math>\n\\frac {\\mbox{GTPase}*\\mbox{GTP}} {\\mbox{GTPase}*\\mbox{GDP}} =\n\\frac {k_\\mbox{diss.GDP}} {k_\\mbox{cat.GTP}}\n</math>\n\nwith ''k<sub>diss.GDP</sub>'' being the dissociation constant of GDP, and ''k<sub>cat.GTP</sub>'' the hydrolysis constant of GTP for the specific GTPase. Both constants can be modified by special regulatory proteins.\n\nThe amount of active GTPase can be changed in several ways : \n# Acceleration of GDP dissociation by GEFs speeds up the building of active GTPase. \n# Inhibition of GDP dissociation by [[Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors]] (GDIs) slows down the building of active GTPase. \n# Acceleration of GTP hydrolysis by GAPs reduces the amount of active GTPase. \n# ''GTP analogues'' like ''&gamma;-S-GTP'', ''&beta;,&gamma;-methylene-GTP'', and ''&beta;,&gamma;-imino-GTP'' that cannot be hydrolyzed fixate the GTPase in its active state.\n\n==Heterotrimeric G proteins==\n{{main|Heterotrimeric G protein}}\nThese G proteins are made from three  subunits, with the G domain located on the largest one (the ''&alpha; unit''); together with the two smaller subunits (''&beta;'' and ''&gamma; units''), they form a tightly associated protein complex. \u03b1 and \u03b3 unit are associated with the membrane by [[lipid anchor]]s. Heterotrimeric G proteins act as the specific reaction partners of [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s. The GTPase is normally inactive. Upon receptor activation, the intracellular receptor domain activates the GTPase, which in turn activates other molecules of the signal transduction chain, either via the \u03b1 unit or the \u03b2\u03b3 complex. Among the target molecules of the active GTPase are [[adenylate cyclase]] and [[ion channel]]s. The heterotrimeric G proteins can be classified by [[sequence homology]] of the \u03b1 unit into four families: \n# ''G<sub>s</sub> family.'' These G proteins are used in the signal transduction of taste and smell. They always use the activation of [[adenylate cyclase]] as the next step in the signal chain. The <sub>s</sub> stands for stimulation. Their function is permanently activated by the [[cholera toxin]], which is the cause of the fatal effects of infection with ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. \n# ''G<sub>i</sub> family.'' The ''i'' stands for ''inhibition'' of the [[adenylate cyclase]]; another effector molecule for this protein family is ''[[phospholipase]] C''. Also, G<sub>t</sub> and G<sub>g</sub> proteins are summarized under this label due to sequence homologies. G<sub>t</sub> proteins, a.k.a. [[transducin]], is used in the light recognition pathway in retina cells. G<sub>g</sub> protein occurs in the taste recognition for ''bitter''. Most G<sub>i</sub> protein family members can be inhibited by the [[pertussis toxin]] of ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]''. \n# ''G<sub>q</sub> family.'' These proteins usually have [[phospholipase]] C as effector protein. \n# ''G<sub>12</sub> family.'' These G proteins can be activated by [[thromboxan receptor]]s and [[thrombin receptor]]s. Their effector proteins are unknown. \nBy combination of different \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits, a great variety (>1000) G proteins can be produced.\nGDP is not needed for GTP.\n\n===Activation cycle of heterotrimeric G proteins===\nIn the basic state, the G<sub>\u03b1</sub>-GDP-G<sub>\u03b2\u03b3</sub> complex and the receptor that can activate it are separately associated with the membrane. On receptor activation, the receptor becomes highly [[electron affinity|affine]] for the G protein - GDP complex. On binding with the complex, GDP dissociates from the complex; the receptor works as a GEF - GDP-GTP Exchange Factor; the ''free'' complex has a high affinity for GTP. Upon GTP binding, both G<sub>\u03b1</sub>-GTP and G<sub>\u03b2\u03b3</sub> separate from both the receptor and from each other. Depending on the lifetime of the active state of the receptor, it can activate more G proteins this way.\n\nBoth G<sub>\u03b1</sub>-GTP and G<sub>\u03b2\u03b3</sub> can now activate separate and/or the same effector molecules, thus sending the signal further down the signal reaction chain. Once the intrinsic GTPase activity of the \u03b1 unit has hydrolyzed the GTP to GDP, and then the two parts associate to the original, inactive state. The speed of the hydrolysis reaction works as an internal clock for the length of the signal.\n\n==The Ras GTPase superfamily==\nThese are small monomeric proteins homologous to [[Ras (protein)|Ras]].  They are also called [[small GTPase]]s.  Small GTPases have a molecular weight of about 21 kilodaltons and generally serve as molecular switches for a variety of cellular signaling events. According to their primary amino acid sequences and biochemical properties, the Ras superfamily is further divided into five subfamilies: [[Ras (protein)|Ras]], [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]], [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab]], [[ADP ribosylation factor|Arf]] and [[Ran protein|Ran]].  The [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]] subfamily is further divided into RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hippenstiel S, Schmeck B, N'Guessan PD, etal |title=Rho protein inactivation induced apoptosis of cultured human endothelial cells |journal=Am.

He was born in [[Barcelona]] by the end of 414. Theodosius died early in the following year, thus eliminating an opportunity for a Romano-Visigothic line.<ref name=\"Ralph W.

In [[Hispania]], Ataulf imprudently accepted into his service a man identified as \"Dubius\" or \"Eberwolf\", a former follower of Sarus. Sarus was a [[Germanic kingship|Germanic chieftain]] who was killed while fighting under Jovinus and Sebastianus. His follower harbored a secret desire to avenge the death of his beloved patron.

According to ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' by [[Edward Gibbon]], the first act of Sigeric's reign \"was the inhuman murder\" of Ataulf's six children from a former marriage \"whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop\" (Sigesar, bishop of the Goths<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>). As for Galla Placidia, as Ataulf's widow, she was \"treated with cruel and wanton insult\" by being forced to walk more than twelve miles on foot among the crowd of captives driven ahead of the mounted Sigeric. Seeing the noble widow's sufferings, however, became one of the factors that roused indignant opponents of the usurper, who quickly assassinated Sigeric and replaced him with [[Wallia]], Ataulf's relative.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/g/g43d/chapter31.html |first=Edward |last=Gibbon |title=History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |chapter=chapter 31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040914234518/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/g/g43d/chapter31.html |archivedate=2004-09-14 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Second marriage==\n[[Image:Ravenna 1978 079.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] in [[Ravenna]] ]]\nAccording to the ''Chronicon Albeldense'', included in the [[Roda Codex]], Wallia was desperate for food supplies.

Two factions of the Roman clergy had proceeded to elect their own popes, the first electing [[Antipope Eulalius|Eulalius]] (27 December) and the other electing [[Pope Boniface I|Boniface I]] (28 December). They acted as rival popes, both in Rome, and their factions plunged the city into tumult. Symmachus, Prefect of Rome, sent his report to the imperial court at Ravenna, requesting an imperial decision on the matter.<ref name=\"CE\">{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope St. Boniface I}}</ref> Placidia and, presumably, Constantius petitioned the emperor in favor of Eulalius.<ref name=\"Ralph W. Mathisen, Galla Placidia\"/> This was arguably the first intervention by an Emperor in the Papal election.\n\nHonorius initially confirmed Eulalius as the legitimate pope. As this failed to put an end to the controversy, Honorius called a [[synod]] of Italian bishops at Ravenna to decide the matter. The synod met from February to March 419 but failed to reach a conclusion. Honorius called a second synod in May, this time including Gaulish and African bishops. In the meantime, the two rival popes were ordered to leave Rome. As [[Easter]] approached, however, Eulalius returned to the city and attempted to seize the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] in order to \"preside at the paschal ceremonies\". Imperial troops managed to repel him, and on Easter (March 30, 419) the ceremonies were led by Achilleus, [[Archdiocese of Spoleto-Norcia|Bishop of Spoleto]]. The conflict cost Eulalius the imperial favor, and Boniface was proclaimed the legitimate pope as of April 3, 419, returning to Rome a week later.<ref name=\"CE\"/> Placidia had personally written to the African bishops, summoning them to the second synod.

Neither title was recognised by Theodosius II, the Eastern Roman Emperor. Constantius reportedly complained about the loss of personal freedom and privacy that came with the imperial office. He died of an illness on September 2, 421.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/westemp5.htm#Note%208 |first=Hugh |last=Elton |title= Western Roman Emperors of the First Quarter of the Fifth Century}}</ref>\n\n==Widow==\n[[File:Honorius et Galla Placidia.JPG|thumb|left|Medallions of Honorius and Galla Placidia, Ravenna, 425]]\nGalla Placidia herself was now forced from the Western Empire.

However, Theodosius hesitated and the decision was delayed. Taking advantage of the [[power vacuum]], [[Castinus]] the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)#Patrician position|Patrician]] proceeded to become a [[kingmaker]]. He declared [[Joannes]], the ''[[primicerius]] [[Notarius|notariorum]]'' \"chief notary\" (the head of the [[civil service]]), to be the new Western Roman Emperor. Among their supporters was [[Flavius Aetius]]. Aetius was a son of [[Flavius Gaudentius]], magister militum, and Aurelia.

In 423/424, Valentinian was named ''[[nobilissimus]]''. In 424, Valentinian was betrothed to [[Licinia Eudoxia]], his first cousin once removed. She was a daughter of Theodosius II and Aelia Eudocia.

Forces of the [[Byzantine army|Eastern Roman army]] gathered at [[Thessaloniki]], and were placed under the general command of Ardaburius, the victorious general of the Roman-Persian War. The invasion force was to cross the [[Adriatic Sea]] by two routes. [[Aspar]], son of Ardaburius, led the cavalry by land, following the coast of the Adriatic from the Western [[Balkans]] to [[Northern Italy]]. Placidia and Valentinian joined this force. Ardaburius and the infantry boarded ships of the [[Byzantine navy|Eastern Roman navy]] in an attempt to reach Ravenna by sea. Aspar marched his forces to [[Aquileia]], taking the city by surprise and with virtually no resistance. The fleet, on the other hand, was dispersed by a storm. Ardaburius and two of his [[galley]]s were captured by forces loyal to Joannes and were held prisoners in Ravenna.<ref name=\"roman-emperors.org\"/><ref name=\"etext.library.adelaide.edu.au\"/>\n\nArdaburius was treated well by Joannes, who probably intended to negotiate with Theodosius for an end to the hostilities. The prisoner was allowed the \"courteous freedom\" of walking the court and streets of Ravenna during his captivity. He took advantage of this privilege to come into contact with the forces of Joannes and convinced some of them to [[Defection|defect]] to Theodosius' side. The conspirators contacted Aspar and beckoned him to Ravenna. A shepherd led Aspar's cavalry force through the [[marsh]]es of the [[Po (river)|Po]] to the gates of Ravenna; with the besiegers outside the walls and the defectors within, the city was quickly captured. Joannes was taken and his right hand cut off; he was then mounted on a [[donkey]] and paraded through the streets, and finally beheaded in the [[hippodrome]] of Aquileia.<ref name=\"roman-emperors.org\"/><ref name=\"etext.library.adelaide.edu.au\"/>\n\nWith Joannes dead, Valentinian was officially proclaimed the new Augustus of the Western Roman Empire on October 23, 425, in the presence of the [[Roman Senate]]. Three days following Joannes' death, Aetius brought reinforcements for his army, a reported number of sixty thousand [[Huns]] from across the [[Danube]]. After some skirmishing, Placidia and Aetius came to an agreement that established the political landscape of the Western Roman Empire for the next thirty years. The Huns were paid off and sent home, while Aetius received the position of ''[[magister militum]] per Gallias ''([[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Roman army]] in Gaul).<ref name=\"roman-emperors.org\"/><ref name=\"etext.library.adelaide.edu.au\"/>\n\n==Regent==\n[[File:Ritratto femminile, forse galla placidia, 400-450 dc ca.

Among her early supporters was [[Bonifacius]], governor of the [[Diocese of Africa]].<ref name=\"Ralph W.

Placidia appointed Bonifacius general of Libya. [[Procopius]] records that Aetius played the two against each other, warning Placidia against Bonifacius and advising her to recall him to Rome; simultaneously writing to Bonifacius, warning him that Placidia was about to summon him for no good reason in order to put him away.<ref name=\"en.wikisource.org\">[[s:History of the Wars/Book III|Procopius, \"History of the Wars\", Book 3, chapter 3]]</ref>\n\nBonifacius, trusting the warning from Aetius, refused the summons; and, thinking his position untenable, sought an alliance with the [[Vandals]] in Spain. The Vandals subsequently crossed from Spain into Libya to join him. To friends of Bonifacius in Rome, this apparent act of hostility toward the Empire seemed entirely out of character for Bonifacius. They traveled to Carthage at Placidia's behest to intercede with him, and he showed them the letter from Aetius. The plot now revealed, his friends returned to Rome to apprise Placidia of the true situation. She did not move against Aetius, as he wielded great influence, and as the Empire was already in danger; but she urged Bonifacius to return to Rome \"and not to permit the empire of the Romans to lie under the hand of barbarians.\"<ref name=\"en.wikisource.org\"/>\n\nBonifacius now regretted his alliance with the Vandals and tried to persuade them to return to Spain.  [[Genseric]] offered battle instead, and Bonifacius was besieged at [[Hippo Regius]] in [[Numidia]] by the sea. ([[Augustine of Hippo]] was its bishop and died in this siege.) Unable to take the city, the Vandals eventually raised the siege. The Romans, with reinforcements under Aspar, renewed the struggle but were routed and lost Africa to the Vandals.<ref name=\"en.wikisource.org\"/>\n\nBonifacius had meanwhile returned to Rome, where Placidia raised him to the rank of patrician and made him \"master-general of the Roman armies\". Aetius returned from Gaul with an army of \"barbarians\", and was met by Bonifacius in the bloody [[Battle of Ravenna (432)]]. Bonifacius won the battle, but was mortally wounded and died a few days later. Aetius was compelled to retire to [[Pannonia]].<ref name=\"en.wikisource.org\"/>\n\n===Rise of Aetius===\nWith the generals loyal to her having either died or defected to Aetius, Placidia acknowledged the inevitable: Aetius was recalled from exile in 433 and given the titles \"magister militum\" and \"Patrician\". The appointments effectively left Aetius in control of the entire Western Roman Army and gave him considerable influence over imperial policy. Placidia continued to act as regent until 437, though her direct influence over decisions was diminished. She would continue to exercise political influence until her death in 450\u2014no longer, however, the only power at court.<ref name=\"Ralph W. Mathisen, Galla Placidia\"/>\n\nAetius later played a pivotal role in the defense of the Western Empire against [[Attila]]. Attila was diverted from Constantinople towards Italy by a letter from Placidia's own daughter [[Justa Grata Honoria]] in the spring of 450, asking him to rescue her from an unwanted marriage to a [[Roman Senate|Roman senator]] that the Imperial family, including Placidia, was trying to force upon her. Honoria included her [[engagement ring]] with the letter. Though Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, Attila chose to interpret her message as such. He accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as [[dowry]]. When Valentinian discovered the plan, only the influence of Placidia persuaded him not to kill Honoria. Valentinian wrote to Attila denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal. Attila, unconvinced, sent an emissary to Ravenna to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his. Honoria was quickly married to Flavius Bassus Herculanus, though this did not prevent Attila from pressing his claim.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/justa.htm |first=Ralph W. |last=Mathisen |chapter=Justa Grata Honoria |editor-last=Weigel |editor-first=Richard D. |title=An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors}}</ref>\n\nPlacidia died shortly afterwards at Rome in November 450, and did not live to see Attila ravage Italy in 451\u2013453, in a much more brutal campaign than the Goths had waged, using Justa's letter as his sole \"legitimate\" excuse.\n\n==Public works==\nPlacidia was a devout [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian Christian]]. She was involved in the building and restoration of various churches throughout her period of influence. She restored and expanded the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]] in [[Rome]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]]. She built [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna]] in thanks for the sparing of her life and those of her children in a storm while crossing the Adriatic Sea. The dedicatory inscription reads \"Galla Placidia, along with her son Placidus Valentinian Augustus and her daughter Justa Grata Honoria Augusta, paid off their vow for their liberation from the danger of the sea.\"<ref name=\"Ralph W. Mathisen, Galla Placidia\"/>\n\nHer [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia|Mausoleum]] in Ravenna was one of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s inscribed in 1996. However, there is some doubt whether the building served as her tomb. The building was initially erected as a chapel dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome]]. It is unknown whether the [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] therein contained the bodies of the members of the Theodosian dynasty, or when they were placed in the building.<ref name=\"Ralph W. Mathisen, Galla Placidia\"/>\n\n==In literature==\n* Two stanzas in [[Alexander Blok]]'s poem \"Ravenna\" (May\u2013June 1909) focus on her tomb; Olga Matich writes: \"For Blok, Galla Placidia represented a synthetic historical figure that linked different cultural histories.\"<ref>Olga Matich, ''Erotic Utopia: The Decadent Imagination in Russia's Fin de Si\u00e8cle'' (Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 2007: {{ISBN|0299208842}}), p. 300.</ref>\n* [[Ezra Pound]] uses her tomb as an exemplar of the \"gold\" remaining from the past, for example in [[The Cantos|Canto]] XXI: \"Gold fades in the gloom,/ Under the blue-black roof, Placidia's...\"\n* [[Louis Zukofsky]] refers to it in his poem \"4 Other Countries,\" reproduced in ''\"A\"'' 17: \"The gold that shines/ in the dark/ of Galla Placidia,/ the gold in the// Round vault rug of stone/ that shows its pattern as well as the stars/ my love might want on her floor...\"\n* [[Carl Jung]] refers to Galla Placidia in his autobiography \"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\", (Chapter IX, Section 'Ravenna and Rome'). He reports a vision of \"four great mosaic frescoes of incredible beauty\" he experienced in the Neonian Bapistery right after visiting Galla's tomb at Ravenna. He had been, he says, \"personally affected by the figure of Galla Placidia\" and goes on to say: \"Her tomb seemed to me a final legacy through which I might reach her personality. Her fate and her whole being were vivid presences to me\". Jung was later surprised to discover that the mosaics he and an acquaintance remembered had actually never existed.\n*Galla Placidia is a major supporting character in [[R.A. Lafferty]]'s  semi-historical work, \"The Fall of Rome,\" which introduces her as \"the goblin child and sister of the two young emperors who, at the age of seventeen, and when all the rest of them were cowed, seized control of the Roman Senate and the City and represented the defiance in the last one hundred days of the world.\"\n\n==In popular culture==\n* Galla Placidia is represented in the [[BBC]]'s [[Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire]] by [[Natasha Barrero]]\n* Spanish musician [[Jaume Pahissa]] wrote the opera ''Galla Plac\u00eddia'' in 1913.\n* Galla Placidia is played by [[Alice Krige]] in the 2001 American TV Miniseries ''[[Attila (miniseries)|Attila]]''\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-roy}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Thermantia]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of Roman and Byzantine Empresses|Western Roman empress consort]]|years=421}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Licinia Eudoxia]]}}\n{{s-bef|before= [[Justina (empress)|Justina]]}} \n{{s-ttl|title=Empress-Mother of the Western Roman Empire|years = September 2, 421 \u2013 November 27, 450}} \n{{s-aft|after=[[Ino Anastasia]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{MLCC|warning=1|date=July 2012}}\n*{{Citation |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |url=http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/g/g43d/chapter33.html |title=History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |chapter=chapter 33 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040914234521/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/g/g43d/chapter33.html |archivedate=2004-09-14 |df= }}\n*{{Citation |editor-last=Weigel |editor-first=Richard D.|title=An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors |url=http://www.roman-emperors.org}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Citation|first=Stewart Irwin |last=Oost |title=Galla Placidia Augusta, A Biographical Essay |year=1967}} is a good, modern study of Placidia and the times in which she lived.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n*[http://mosaicartsource.wordpress.com/category/mosaic/mosaic-resources/mosaic-travel/galla-placidia/ Pictures of the mausoleum of Galla Placidia]\n*[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1269.html Entry of Aelia Flaccilla in the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]\n*[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus05_book5.htm Zosimus, New History.

Hence, Benozzo explains the ethnonym ''Callaeci''  as being \"the stone people\" or \"the people of the stone\" (\"those who work with stones\"), in reference to the builders of the ancient [[megalith|megaliths]] and stone formations so common in Galicia.<ref>Benozzo, F.

In the 13th century, with the written emergence of the Galician language, ''Galiza'' became the most usual written form of the name of the country, being replaced during the 15th and 16th centuries by the current form, ''Galicia.'' This coincides with the spelling of the [[Castilian Spanish]] name. The historical denomination ''Galiza'' became popular again during the end of the 19th and the first three-quarters of the 20th century, and is still used with some frequency today.

These were usually annular forts, with one or more concentric earthen or stony walls, with a trench in front of each one. They were frequently located at hills, or in seashore cliffs and peninsulas. Some well known ''castros'' can be found  on the seashore at: Fazouro, Santa Tegra, Baro\u00f1a, and O Neix\u00f3n; and inland at: [[San Cibrao de L\u00e1s hill fort|San Cibrao de L\u00e1s]], Borneiro, Castromao, and Viladonga. Some other distinctive features, such as temples, baths, reservoirs, warrior statues and decorative carvings have been found associated to this culture, together with rich gold and metalworking traditions.\n\nThe Roman legions first entered the area under [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus|Decimus Junius Brutus]] in 137\u2013136 BC,<ref>Livy lv., lvi., ''Epitome''</ref> but the country was only incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] by the time of [[Augustus]] (29 BC \u2013 19 BC). The Romans were interested in Galicia mainly for its mineral resources, most notably gold. Under Roman rule, most Galician hillforts began to be \u2013 sometimes forcibly \u2013 abandoned, and [[Gallaeci]] served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops. Romans brought new technologies, new travel routes, new forms of organizing property, and a new language; [[latin language|Latin]]. The [[Roman Empire]] established its control over Galicia through camps (''castra'') as ''Aquis Querquennis'', Ciadella camp or [[Lugo|Lucus Augusti]] ([[Lugo]]), roads (''viae'') and monuments as the lighthouse known as ''[[Tower of Hercules]]'', in [[A Coru\u00f1a|Corunna]], but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century of our era, when the gold mines stopped being productive, led to a lesser degree of ''[[Romanization]]''. In the 3rd century it was made a province, under the name Gallaecia, which included also northern Portugal, [[Asturias]], and a large section of what today is known as [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]].\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n{{Main article|Kingdom of the Suebi}}\n[[File:Cvp-00791-109v.jpg|thumb|right|[[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]], king of Galicia, and [[Martin of Braga]], from an 1145 manuscript of Martin's ''Formula Vitae Honestae'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/martinbraga/formula.shtml |title='&#39;Formula Vitae Honestae'&#39; |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref> now in the Austrian National Library.

Its progress towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]] forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (''foedus'') by which the Suebi would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a [[Britons (historical)|Briton]] colony and bishopric (see [[Mailoc]]) was established in Northern Galicia ([[Britonia]]), probably as [[foederati]] and allies of the Suebi. In 585, the [[Visigoth]]ic [[King Leovigild]] invaded the Suebic kingdom of Galicia and defeated it, bringing it under Visigoth control.\n\nLater the [[Arab Empire|Muslims]] invaded Spain (711), but the Arabs and [[Moors]] never managed to have any real control over Galicia, which was later incorporated into the expanding Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]], usually known as Gallaecia or Galicia (''Yill\u012bqiya'' and ''Gal\u012bsiya'') by Muslim Chroniclers,<ref>Cf.

As the Middle Ages went on, Santiago became a major pilgrim destination and the [[Way of Saint James]] (Cami\u00f1o de Santiago) a major pilgrim road, a route for the propagation of [[Romanesque art]] and the words and music of the [[troubador]]s. During the 10th and 11th centuries, a period during which Galician nobility become related to the royal family, Galicia was at times headed by its own [[List of Galician monarchs|native kings]], while [[Vikings]] (locally known as ''Leodemanes'' or ''Lordomanes'') occasionally raided the coasts. The Towers of [[Catoira]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Eduardo Loureiro |url=http://www.catoira.net |title=Viking Festival webpage |publisher=Catoira.net |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> (Pontevedra) were built as a system of fortifications to prevent and stop the Viking raids on Santiago de Compostela.\n\nIn 1063, [[Ferdinand I of Castile]] divided his realm among his sons, and the Kingdom of Galicia was granted to [[Garcia II of Galicia]]. In 1072, it was forcibly annexed by Garcia's brother [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n]]; from that time Galicia was united with the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]] under the same monarchs. In the 13th century [[Alfonso X of Castile]] standardized the [[Castilian language]] and made it the language of court and government. Nevertheless, in his Kingdom of Galicia the [[Galician language]] was the only language spoken, and the most used in government and legal uses, as well as in [[Galician-Portuguese lyric|literature]].\n\n[[File:Medieval baseball (El juego de la Pelota) in the Cantigas de Santa Maria.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]] (13th century)]]\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries, the progressive distancing of the kings from Galician affairs left the kingdom in the hands of the local knights, counts and bishops, who frequently fought each other to increase their fiefs, or simply to plunder the lands of others. At the same time, the deputies of the Kingdom in the ''[[Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia|Cortes]]'' stopped being called. The Kingdom of Galicia, slipping away from the control of the King, responded with a century of fiscal insubordination.\n\n[[File:Un dos motivos centrais da Igrexa de Vilar de Donas.jpg|thumb|left|Gothic painting at Vilar de Donas' church, [[Palas de Rei]]]]\nOn the other hand, the lack of an effective royal justice system in the Kingdom led to the social conflict known as the ''[[Irmandi\u00f1o|Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as]]'' ('Wars of the brotherhoods'), when leagues of peasants and burghers, with the support of a number of knights, noblemen, and under legal protection offered by the remote king, toppled many of the castles of the Kingdom and briefly drove the noblemen into Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Joanna La Beltraneja]], part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler [[Zurita y Castro, Jeronimo|Jeronimo Zurita]] defined as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the ''Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia'') and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation. At the same time the kings began to call the [[Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia|''Xunta'' or ''Cortes'' of the Kingdom of Galicia]], an assembly of deputies or representatives of the cities of the Kingdom, to ask for monetary and military contributions. This assembly soon developed into the voice and legal representation of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will and laws.\n\n===Early Modern===\n{{See also|Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia}}\n[[File:Sueiro Gomes de Souto Maior.JPG|thumb|Tomb of the knight Sueiro G\u00f3mez de Soutomaior]]\nThe modern period of the [[kingdom of Galicia]] began with the murder or defeat of some of the most powerful Galician lords, such as Pedro \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor, called [[Pedro Madruga]], and Rodrigo Henriquez Osorio, at the hands of the Castilian armies sent to Galicia between the years 1480 and 1486. [[Isabella I of Castile]], considered a usurper by many Galician nobles, eradicated all armed resistance and definitively established the royal power of the Castilian monarchy.  Fearing a general revolt, the monarchs ordered the banishing of the rest of the great lords like Pedro de Bola\u00f1o, Diego de Andrade or Lope S\u00e1nchez de Moscoso, among others.\n\n[[File:Descripcion Reyno de Galizia de Ojea.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Kingdom of Galicia, 1603]]\nThe establishment of the [[Santa Hermandad]] in 1480, and of the [[Real Audiencia]] del Reino de Galicia in 1500\u2014a tribunal and executive body directed by the [[Governor]]-[[Captain General]] as a direct representative of the King\u2014implied initially the submission of the Kingdom to the Crown,<ref>{{cite book|last=Mari\u00f1o Paz|first=Ram\u00f3n|title=Historia da lingua galega|year=1998|publisher=Sotelo Blanco|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=84-7824-333-X|page=195|edition=2.}}</ref> after a century of unrest and fiscal insubordination.

The most famous assaults were upon the city of Vigo by [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] in 1585 and 1589, and the siege of [[A Coru\u00f1a]] in 1589 by the ''[[English Armada]]''.

During the pre-war period the Supreme Council of the Kingdom of Galicia (''Junta Suprema del Reino de Galicia''), auto-proclaimed interim sovereign in 1808, was the sole government of the country and mobilized near 40,000 men against the invaders.\n\nThe [[1833 territorial division of Spain]] put a formal end to the Kingdom of Galicia, unifying Spain into a single centralized monarchy. Instead of seven provinces and a regional administration, Galicia was reorganized into the current four provinces. Although it was recognized as a \"historical region\", that status was strictly honorific. In reaction, [[Galician nationalism|nationalist]] and [[federalism|federalist]] movements arose.\n\n[[File:Batalla Elvi\u00f1a Eli2.jpg|thumb|left|Re-enactment of the [[Battle of Corunna]]]]\nThe [[liberalism|liberal]] General [[Miguel Sol\u00eds Cuetos]] led a [[Sol\u00eds Uprising|separatist coup attempt]] in 1846 against the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime of [[Ram\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Narv\u00e1ez]]. Sol\u00eds and his forces were defeated at the [[Battle of Cacheiras]], 23 April 1846, and the survivors, including Sol\u00eds himself, were shot. They have taken their place in Galician memory as the Martyrs of Carral or simply the Martyrs of Liberty.\n\nDefeated on the military front, Galicians turned to culture. The ''[[Rexurdimento]]'' focused on recovery of the Galician language as a vehicle of social and cultural expression. Among the writers associated with this movement are [[Rosal\u00eda de Castro]], [[Manuel Murgu\u00eda]], [[Manuel Leiras Pulpeiro]], and [[Eduardo Pondal]].\n\nIn the early 20th century came another turn toward nationalist politics with ''[[Solidaridad Gallega]]'' (1907\u20131912) modeled on ''[[Solidaritat Catalana]]'' in [[Catalonia]]. Solidaridad Gallega failed, but in 1916 ''[[Irmandades da Fala]]'' (Brotherhood of the Language) developed first as a cultural association but soon as a full-blown nationalist movement. [[Vicente Risco]] and [[Ram\u00f3n Otero Pedrayo]] were outstanding cultural figures of this movement, and the magazine ''[[N\u00f3s (Galicia)|N\u00f3s]]'' ('Us'), founded 1920, its most notable cultural institution, [[Lois Pe\u00f1a Novo]] the outstanding political figure.\n\nThe [[Second Spanish Republic]] was declared in 1931. During the republic, the [[Partido Galeguista (1931)|Partido Galeguista]] (PG) was the most important of a shifting collection of [[Galician nationalist]] parties. Following a referendum on a [[Galician Statute of Autonomy (1936)|Galician Statute of Autonomy]], Galicia was granted the status of an autonomous region.\n\n[[File:Estatuto de Galicia de 1936.pdf|thumb|''Estatuto de Galicia'' ([[pdf]]).]]\nGalicia was spared the worst of the fighting in that war: it was one of the areas where the initial coup attempt at the outset of the war was successful, and it remained in Nationalist (Franco's army's) hands throughout the war. While there were no pitched battles, there was repression and death: all political parties were abolished, as were all labor unions and Galician nationalist organizations as the ''Seminario de Estudos Galegos''. Galicia's statute of autonomy was annulled (as were those of [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] provinces once those were conquered). According to [[Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Santander]], at least 4,200 people were killed either extrajudicially or after summary trials, among them republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists and anarchists.

The R\u00edas Altas can sometimes refer only to those east of [[Estaca de Bares Point|Estaca de Bares]], with the others being called ''R\u00edas Medias'' (\"Intermediate R\u00edas\").\n\nErosion by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] has contributed to the great number of [[cape (geography)|capes]]. Besides the aforementioned Estaca de Bares in the far north, separating the Atlantic Ocean from the Cantabrian Sea, other notable capes are [[Cape Ortegal]], Cape Prior, Punta Santo Adrao, Cape Vil\u00e1n, Cape Touri\u00f1\u00e1n (westernmost point in Galicia), [[Cape Finisterre]] or Fisterra, considered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], along with [[Finist\u00e8re]] in [[Brittany]] and [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]], to be the end of the known world.\n\n[[File:R\u00eda de Ferrol desde o Coto de Ancos.retocada.jpg|thumb|left|The ''R\u00eda'' of Ferrol was an important military base of Spain]]\nAll along the Galician coast are various [[archipelago]]s near the mouths of the ''r\u00edas''.

Cervantes, Galiza.jpg|thumb|'Tres Bispos' peak, [[Cervantes, Lugo]]]]\nGalicia is quite [[mountainous]], a fact which has contributed to isolate the rural areas, hampering communications, most notably in the inland. The main mountain range is the [[Macizo Galaico]] ([[Serra do Eixe]], [[Serra da Lastra]], [[Serra do Courel]]), also known as ''Macizo Galaico-Leon\u00e9s'', located in the eastern parts, bordering with [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]]. Noteworthy mountain ranges are [[O Xistral]] (northern [[province of Lugo|Lugo]]), the [[Serra dos Ancares]] (on the border with [[Province of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Asturias]]), [[O Courel]] (on the border with Le\u00f3n), [[O Eixe]] (the border between [[Province of Ourense|Ourense]] and [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]]), [[Serra de Queixa]] (in the center of Ourense province), [[O Faro]] (the border between Lugo and Pontevedra), [[Cova da Serpe]] (border of Lugo and A Coru\u00f1a), [[Montemaior]] (A Coru\u00f1a), [[Montes do Testeiro]], [[Serra do Su\u00eddo]], and [[Faro de Avi\u00f3n]] (between Pontevedra and Ourense); and, to the south, [[A Peneda]], [[O Xur\u00e9s]] and [[O Larouco]], all on the border of Ourense and Portugal.\n\nThe highest point in Galicia is [[Trevinca]] or Pena Trevinca ({{convert|2124|m|ft|disp=or}}), located in the Serra do Eixe, at the border between Ourense and Le\u00f3n and Zamora provinces.

The largest and most important of these rivers is the [[Minho River|Mi\u00f1o]], poetically known as ''O Pai Mi\u00f1o'' (Father Mi\u00f1o), which is  {{convert|307.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and discharges {{convert|419|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}} per second, with its affluent the [[Sil (river)|Sil]], which has created a spectacular canyon. Most of the rivers in the inland are tributaries of this river system, which drains some {{convert|17,027|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Other rivers run directly into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or the [[Cantabrian Sea]], most of them having short courses. Only the [[Navia (river)|Navia]], [[Ulla (river)|Ulla]], [[Tambre]], and [[Limia]] have courses longer than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nGalicia's many [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dams take advantage of the steep, deep, narrow rivers and their canyons. Due to their steep course, few of Galicia's rivers are navigable, other than the lower portion of the Mi\u00f1o and the portions of various rivers that have been dammed into reservoirs. Some rivers are navigable by small boats in their lower reaches: this is taken great advantage of in a number of semi-aquatic festivals and pilgrimages.\n\n===Environment===\n[[File:Can\u00f3ns do Sil, Nogueira de Ramu\u00edn e Ribas de Sil.jpg|thumb|left|The River [[Sil (river)|Sil]] and its canyon]]\nGalicia has preserved some of its dense forests. It is relatively unpolluted, and its landscapes composed of green hills, cliffs and ''rias'' are generally different from what is commonly understood as Spanish landscape. Nevertheless, Galicia has some important environmental problems.\n\nDeforestation and forest fires are a problem in many areas, as is the continual spread of the [[eucalyptus]] tree, a species imported from Australia, actively promoted by the paper industry since the mid-20th century. Galicia is one of the more forested areas of Spain, but the majority of Galicia's plantations, usually growing eucalyptus or pine, lack any formal management.<ref>Paula P\u00e9rez, [http://www.farodevigo.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=3268_4_201060__Galicia-desorden-bosques ''El desorden de los bosques''], FaroDeVigo.es. Retrieved 2010-02-17.</ref> Massive eucalyptus plantation, especially of ''[[Eucalyptus globulus ]]'', began in the [[Francisco Franco]] era, largely on behalf of the paper company Empresa Nacional de Celulosas de Espa\u00f1a (ENCE) in [[Pontevedra]], which wanted it for its pulp. Wood products figure significantly in Galicia's economy. Apart from tree plantations Galicia is also notable for the extensive surface occupied by meadows used for animal husbandry, especially [[cattle]], an important activity. Hydroelectric development in most rivers has been a serious concern for local conservationists during the last decades.\n\nFauna, most notably the [[Eurasian wolf|European wolf]], has suffered because of the actions of livestock owners and farmers, and because of the loss of habitats, whilst the native deer species have declined because of hunting and development.\n\nOil spills are a major issue. The [[Prestige oil spill]] in 2002 spilt more oil than the [[Exxon Valdez]] in [[Alaska]].\n\n===Biodiversity===\nGalicia has more than 2,800 plant species. Plant endemics are represented by 31 taxons. A few oak forests (known locally as ''fragas'') remain, particularly in the north-central part of the province of Lugo and the north of the province of A Coru\u00f1a (Fragas do Eume).\n\n[[File:Dende a Garita de Erbeira 02.JPG|thumb|Galician Blond cows]]\nGalicia has 262 inventoried species of [[vertebrate]]s, including 12 species of freshwater fish, 15 [[amphibian]]s, 24 [[reptile]]s, 152 birds, and 59 mammals.<ref>Enciclopedia Galega Universal ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080713074541/http://www.egu.es/ online version])</ref>\n\nThe animals most often thought of as being \"typical\" of Galicia are the livestock raised there. The [[Galician horse]] is native to the region, as is the [[Galician Blond]] cow and the domestic [[fowl]] known as the ''gali\u00f1a de [[Mos (Spain)|Mos]]''.

Several important bird migration routes pass through Galicia, and some of the community's relatively few environmentally protected areas are [[Special Protection Area]]s (such as on the R\u00eda de Ribadeo) for these birds. From a domestic point of view, Galicia has been credited for author [[Manuel Rivas]] as the \"land of one million cows\". [[Galician Blond]] and [[Holstein cattle]] coexist on meadows and farms.\n\n==Climate==\nBeing located on the Atlantic coastline, Galicia has a very mild climate for the latitude and the marine influence affects most of the province to various degrees. In comparison to similar latitudes on the other side of the Atlantic, winters are exceptionally mild, with consistently heavy rainfall.

For well over a century Galicia has grown more slowly than the rest of Spain, due largely to a poorer economy compared with other regions of Spain and [[emigration]] to [[Latin America]] and to other parts of Spain. Sometimes Galicia has lost population in absolute terms. In 1857, Galicia had Spain's [[population density|densest]] population and constituted 11.5% of the national population. {{As of|2007}}, only 6.1% of the Spanish population resided in the autonomous community. This is due to an exodus of Galician people since the 19th century, first to [[South America]] and later to [[Central Europe]] and to the development of population centers and industry in other parts of Spain.\n\nAccording to the 2006 census, Galicia has a [[fertility rate]] of 1.03 children per woman, compared to 1.38 nationally, and far below the figure of 2.1 that represents a stable populace.<ref name=\"hijos\">[http://www.galicia-hoxe.com/index_2.php?idMenu=79&idNoticia=307692 As lucenses son as que menos fillos te\u00f1en en Espa\u00f1a], Galicia-Hoxe.com.</ref> Lugo and Ourense provinces have the lowest fertility rates in Spain, 0.88 and 0.93, respectively.<ref name=\"hijos\" />\n\nIn northern Galicia, the [[A Coru\u00f1a]]-[[Ferrol, A Coru\u00f1a|Ferrol]] metropolitan area has become increasingly dominant in terms of population. The population of the city of A Coru\u00f1a in 1900 was 43,971. The population of the rest of the province, including the City and Naval Station of nearby Ferrol and Santiago de Compostela, was 653,556. A Coru\u00f1a's growth occurred after the [[Spanish Civil War]] at the same speed as other major Galician cities, but since the revival of democracy after the death of [[Francisco Franco]], A Coru\u00f1a has grown at a faster rate than all the other Galician cities.\n\nThe rapid increase of population of [[A Coru\u00f1a]], Vigo and to a lesser degree other major Galician cities, like [[Ourense]], [[Pontevedra]] or [[Santiago de Compostela]] during the years that followed the [[Spanish Civil War]] during the mid-20th century occurred as the rural population declined: many villages and hamlets of the four provinces of Galicia disappeared or nearly disappeared during the same period. [[Economic development]] and mechanization of agriculture resulted in the fields being abandoned, and most of the population moving to find jobs in the main cities. The number of people working in the [[Tertiary sector of industry|Tertiary]] and [[Quaternary sector of industry|Quaternary sectors]] of the economy has increased significantly.\n\nSince 1999, the absolute number of births in Galicia has been increasing.

Significant internal migration took place from Galicia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to the industrialized Spanish cities of [[Barcelona]], [[Bilbao]], [[Zaragoza]] and [[Madrid]]. Other Galicians emigrated to [[Latin America]] &ndash; [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]] and [[Cuba]] in particular. [[Fidel Castro]] was born in Cuba to a wealthy planter father who was an immigrant from Galicia; Castro's mother was of Galician descent.\n\nThe two cities with the greatest number of people of Galician descent outside Galicia are [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, and nearby [[Montevideo]], Uruguay. Immigration from Galicia was so significant in these areas that Argentines and Uruguayans now commonly refer to all Spaniards as ''gallegos'' (Galicians).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=gallego|title=Gallegos|publisher=[[Real Academia Espanola]]|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Spain under Francisco Franco|Franco]] years, there was a new wave of emigration out of Galicia to other European countries, most notably to [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Kingdom]].  Many of these immigrant or expatriate communities have their own groups or clubs, which they formed in the first decades of settling in a new place.  The Galician diaspora is so widespread that websites such as [[Fillos de Galicia]] have been created in the 21st century to organize and form a network of ethnic Galicians throughout the world.\n\nThe proportion of foreign-born people in Galicia is only 2.9 percent compared to a national figure of 10 percent; among the autonomous communities, only [[Extremadura]] has a lower percentage of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/jaxi/menu.do?type=pcaxis&path=/t20/e245&file=inebase&L=|title=Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica.

Galician originated regionally; the latter was associated with [[County of Castile|Castile]]. Galician is recognized in the Statute of Autonomy of Galicia as the ''lingua propia'' (\"own language\") of Galicia.\n\nGalician is closely related to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

There are more than three million Galician speakers in the world.<ref name=\"ethnologue\" /> Galician ranks in the lower orders of the 150 most widely spoken languages on earth.<ref name=\"DossierGalicia\" />\n\nFor more than four centuries of Castilian domination, Spanish was the only official language in Galicia.  Galician faded from day-to-day use in urban areas. Since the re-establishment of democracy in Spain\u2014in particular since passage and implementation of the ''Lei de Normalizaci\u00f3n Ling\u00fc\u00edstica'' (\"Law of Linguistic Normalization\", Ley 3/1983, 15 June 1983)\u2014the first generation of students in mass education has attended schools conducted in Galician. (Castilian Spanish is also taught.)\n\nSince the late 20th century and the establishment of Galicia's autonomy, the Galician language is resurgent. In the cities, it is generally used as a second language for most. According to a 2001 census, 99.16 percent of the population of Galicia understood the language, 91.04 percent spoke it, 68.65 percent could read it and 57.64 percent could write it.<ref name=\"lang-census\">[http://www.xunta.es/linguagalega/arquivos/PNL22x24_textointegro).pdf Plano Xeral de Normalizaci\u00f3n da lingua galega] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215032113/http://www.xunta.es/linguagalega/arquivos/PNL22x24_textointegro%29.pdf |date=15 February 2010 }}, Xunta de Galicia.

The names and memories of Codax and other popular cultural figures are well preserved in modern Galicia.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:SantiagoCatedral!.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]], seat of the Archbishop of Santiago of Compostela, and third most important centre of pilgrimage in [[Christianity]].]]\n[[Christianity]] is the most widely practised religion in Galicia. It was introduced in [[Late Antiquity]] and was practiced alongside the native Celtic religion for a few centuries which, incidentally, was re-established as an officially recognised religion in 2015<ref>[https://durvate.wordpress.com/2015/08/03/e-oficial-its-official/ \u00c9 oficial - It's official], ''Irmandade Dru\u00eddica Galaica'' (Pan-Galician Druidic Fellowship) (access 1 August 2018)</ref>. Still, today about 82.2% of Galicians identify as Catholic.<ref name=\"lavanguardia.com\"/> Most Christians adhere to Roman Catholicism, though only 20% of the population described themselves as active members. The [[Catholic Church]] in Galicia has had its primatial seat in [[Santiago de Compostela]] since the 12th century.\n\nSince the [[Middle Ages]], the Galician Catholic Church has been organized into five ecclesiastical dioceses ([[Diocese of Lugo|Lugo]], [[Diocese of Ourense|Ourense]], [[Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela|Santiago de Compostela]], [[Diocese of Mondo\u00f1edo-Ferrol|Mondo\u00f1edo-Ferrol]] and [[Diocese of Tui-Vigo|Tui-Vigo]]). While these may have coincided with contemporary 15th-century civil provinces, they no longer have the same boundaries as the modern civil provincial divisions. The church is led by one archbishop and four bishops. The five dioceses of Galicia are divided among 163 districts and 3,792 parishes. A few are governed by administrators, the remainder by parish priests.\n\nThe patron saint of Galicia is [[Saint James the Greater]]. According to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] tradition, his body was discovered in 814 near Compostela. After that date, the relics of Saint James attracted an extraordinary number of pilgrims. Since the 9th century these relics have been kept in the heart of the church &ndash; the modern-day [[cathedral]] &ndash; dedicated to him. There are many other Galician and associated saints; some of the best-known are: [[Ansurius|Saint Ansurius]], [[Rudesind|Saint Rudesind]], [[Marina of Aguas Santas|Saint Mari\u00f1a of Augas Santas]], [[Senorina|Saint Senorina]], Trahamunda and Froilan.\n\nSince the 1960s, as immigrants have entered Galicia, they have brought their religions with them. In 2010 there were estimated to be 25,000 [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]] (from eastern Europe) numbered about 10,000.  There are now adherents to [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Judaism]] in the four provinces. In addition, around 16.6% of Galicians say that they have no religion<ref name=\"lavanguardia.com\"/> and only a small minority admit following the native Celtic beliefs.\n\n===Education===\nGalicia's education system is administered by the regional government's Ministry of Education and University Administration. 76% of Galician teenagers achieve a [[high school diploma|high school degree]] &ndash; ranked fifth out of the 17 autonomous communities.\n\nThere are three [[public universities]] in Galicia: [[University of A Coru\u00f1a]] with campuses in [[A Coru\u00f1a]] and [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]], [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] with campuses in [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[Lugo]] and the [[University of Vigo]] with campuses in [[Pontevedra]], [[Ourense]] and [[Vigo]].\n\n===Health care===\n{{Main article|Servizo Galego de Sa\u00fade}}\nGalicia's [[Publicly funded health care|public healthcare]] system is the {{lang|gl|Servizo Galego de Sa\u00fade}} (SERGAS). It is administered by the regional government's Ministry of Health.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main article|Galician culture}}\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Cathedral of Ourense (Spain).jpg|thumb|right|Romanesque fa\u00e7ade in the Cathedral of [[Ourense]] (1160); founded in the 6th century, its construction is attributed to King [[Chararic (Suebian king)|Chararic]].]]\nHundreds of ancient standing stone monuments like [[dolmen]]s, [[menhir]]s and megalithics [[Tumulus]] were erected during the prehistoric period in Galicia, amongst the best-known are the dolmens of Dombate, Corveira, Axeitos of Pedra da Arca, menhirs like the \"Lapa de Garg\u00f1\u00e1ns\". From the [[Iron Age]], Galicia has a rich heritage based mainly on a great number of [[Hill fort]]s, few of them excavated like Baro\u00f1a, Sta. Tegra, San Cibrao de L\u00e1s and Formigueiros among others. With the introduction of Ancient Roman architecture there was a development of basilicas, [[castra]], city walls, cities, villas, Roman temples, Roman roads, and the Roman bridge of [[Ponte Vella]]. It was the Romans who founded some of the first cities in Galicia like [[Lugo]] and [[Ourense]]. Perhaps the best-known examples are the [[Roman Walls of Lugo]] and the [[Tower of Hercules]] in [[A Coru\u00f1a]].\n[[File:Castelo de Pambre 2.JPG|thumb|left|The castle of Pambre, [[Palas de Rei]], which resisted the ''Irmandi\u00f1os'' troops]]\nDuring the Middle Ages, a huge quantity of fortified castles were built by Galician feudal nobles to mark their powers against their rivals. Although the most of them were demolished during the [[Irmandi\u00f1o|Irmandi\u00f1o Wars]] (1466\u20131469), some Galician castles that survived are Pambre, Castro Caldelas, [[Sobroso Castle|Sobroso]], [[Castle of Soutomaior|Soutomaior]] and Monterrei among others. Ecclesiastical architecture raised early in Galicia, and the first churches and monasteries as San Pedro de Rocas, began to be built in 5th and 6th centuries. However, the most famous medieval architecture in Galicia had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe. Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in Galicia are the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]], the [[Ourense Cathedral]], [[Saint John of Caaveiro]], Our Lady Mary of [[Cambre]] and the [[Church of San Xo\u00e1n of Portomar\u00edn]] among others.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main article|Galician cuisine}}\n[[File:Polbo e empanada, Galiza.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Polbo \u00e1 feira]]]]\nGalician cuisine often uses fish and shellfish. The ''[[empanada]]'' is a meat or fish pie, with a bread-like base, top and crust with the meat or fish filling usually being in a tomato sauce including onions and garlic. ''[[Caldo galego]]'' is a hearty soup whose main ingredients are potatoes and a local vegetable named [[Rapini|grelo (Broccoli rabe)]]. The latter is also employed in ''Lac\u00f3n con grelos'', a typical carnival dish, consisting of pork shoulder boiled with ''grelos'', potatoes and [[chorizo]]. ''[[Centolla]]'' is the equivalent of [[king crab]]. It is prepared by being boiled alive, having its main body opened like a shell, and then having its innards mixed vigorously. Another popular dish is [[octopus]], boiled (traditionally in a copper pot) and served in a wooden plate, cut into small pieces and laced with olive oil, sea salt and ''[[piment\u00f3n]]'' (Spanish paprika). This dish is called ''Pulpo a la gallega'' or in Galician \"Polbo \u00e1 Feira\", which roughly translates as \"Galician-style Octopus\". There are several regional varieties of cheese. The best-known one is the so-called ''[[tetilla cheese|tetilla]]'', named after its breast-like shape. Other highly regarded varieties include the San Sim\u00f3n cheese from [[Vilalba]] and the creamy cheese produced in the [[Arz\u00faa]]-Ulloa area. A classical dessert is ''filloas'', cr\u00eape-like pancakes made with flour, broth or milk, and eggs. When cooked at a [[pig slaughter]] festival, they may also contain the animal's blood. A famous almond cake called ''[[Tarta de Santiago]]'' (St. James' cake) is a Galician sweet speciality mainly produced in Santiago de Compostela and all around Galicia.\n\n[[File:Albari\u00f1os.

The grape varieties used are local and rarely found outside Galicia and Northern Portugal. Just as notably from Galicia comes the spirit ''[[Augardente]]''\u2014the name means burning water\u2014often referred to as [[Orujo]] in Spain and internationally or as [[Orujo|ca\u00f1a]] in Galicia.

A team of expat Galicians in [[Salvador, Brazil]] have also formed Galicia Rugby, a sister team of the local football club.\nJames Boykins Obituary - Rochester, NY | Rochester Democrat And Chronicle\n\n==Symbols==\n{{Main article|Coat of arms of Galicia (Spain)|Flag of Galicia}}\n[[File:Escudo reino de galicia.jpg|thumb|Coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]] (''L'armorial Le Blancq'', c. 1560 AD).]]\nA golden [[chalice]] enclosed in a field of [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] has been the symbol of Galicia since the 13th century. Originated as a [[Canting arms]] due to the phonetic similarity between the words \"chalice\" and ''Galyce'' (\"Galicia\" in old [[Norman language]]), the first documented mention of this emblem is on the ''Segar's Roll'', an English medieval [[roll of arms]] where are represented all the Christian kingdoms of 13th-century Europe. In following centuries, the Galician emblem was variating; diverse shapes and number of chalices (initially three and later one or five), wouldn't be until the 16th century that its number was fixed finally as one single chalice. Centuries after, a field of crosses was slowly added to the azure background, and latterly also a silver host. Since then basically the emblem of the kingdom would be kept until nowadays.\n\nThe ancient flag of the Kingdom of Galicia was based mainly on its [[coat of arms]] until the 19th century. However, when in 1833 the Government of Spain decided to abolish the kingdom and divided it in four provinces,  the Galician emblem as well as flag, lost its legal status and international validity. It wouldn't be until the late 19th century that some Galician intellectuals (nationalist politicians and writers) began to use a new flag as symbol a renewed national unity for Galicia. That flag, what was composed by a diagonal stripe over a white background, was designated \"official flag of Galicia\" in 1984, after the fall of the Franco's dictatorship. In addition, the Royal Academy of Galicia asked the Galician government to incorporate the ancient coat of arms of the kingdom onto the modern flag, being present in it since then.\n\nIn addition to its coat of arms and flag, Galicia also has an own anthem. While it is true that the Kingdom of Galicia had during centuries a kind of unofficial anthem known as the \"Solemn March of the kingdom\", the Galician current anthem was not created until 1907, although its composition had begun already in 1880. Titled \"[[Os Pinos]]\" (\"The Pines\"), the Galician anthem lyrics was written by [[Eduardo Pondal]], one of the greatest modern Galician poets, and its music was composed by Pascual Veiga. Performed for the first time in 1907 in [[Havana]] ([[Cuba]]) by Galician emigrants, the anthem was banned since 1927 by diverse Spanish Governments until 1977, when it was officially established by the Galician authorities.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Sights==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130px\" style=\"line-height:130%>\nFile:Dolmen axeitos.JPG|''Anta'' ([[dolmen]]) at Axeitos, [[Santa Ux\u00eda de Ribeira|Ribeira]].

They are activated in response to a [[conformational change]] in the GPCR, exchanging GDP for GTP, and dissociating in order to activate other proteins in a particular [[signal transduction]] pathway.

The GTP (or GDP) is bound to the G<sub>\u03b1</sub> subunit in the traditional view of heterotrimeric GPCR activation. This exchange triggers the dissociation of the G<sub>\u03b1</sub> subunit (which is bound to GTP) from the G<sub>\u03b2\u03b3</sub> dimer and the receptor as a whole.

In 1971, he helped develop ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'', a miniatures wargame based on [[medieval]] warfare. He co-founded the company [[Tactical Studies Rules]] (TSR, Inc.) with childhood friend [[Don Kaye]] in 1973. The following year, he and Arneson created ''D&D'', which expanded on Gygax's ''Chainmail'' and included elements of the fantasy stories he loved as a child. In the same year, he founded ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'', a magazine based around the new game. In 1977, Gygax began work on a more comprehensive version of the game, called ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]''. Gygax designed numerous manuals for the game system, as well as several pre-packaged [[Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)|adventures]] called \"modules\" that gave a person running a ''D&D'' game (the \"[[Dungeon Master]]\") a rough script and ideas on how to run a particular gaming scenario. In 1983, he worked to license the ''D&D'' product line into the successful [[Dungeons & Dragons (TV series)|''D&D'' cartoon series]].\n\nAfter leaving TSR in 1985 over issues with its new majority owner, Gygax continued to create role-playing game titles independently, beginning with the multi-genre ''[[Dangerous Journeys]]'' in 1992. He designed another gaming system called ''[[Lejendary Adventure]]'', released in 1999. In 2005, Gygax was involved in the ''[[Castles & Crusades]]'' role-playing game, which was conceived as a hybrid between the third edition of ''D&D'' and the original version of the game conceived by Gygax.\n\nGygax was married twice and had six children. In 2004, Gygax suffered two strokes, narrowly avoided a subsequent heart attack, was then diagnosed with an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]], and died in March 2008.\n\n== Early life and inspiration ==\nGygax was born in Chicago, the son of Almina Emelie \"Posey\" (Burdick)<ref>http://humphrysfamilytree.com/Royal/Larson/Edw3-GaryGygax.pdf</ref> and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] immigrant and former [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] violinist Ernst Gygax.<ref name=\"TheTimesObit\">{{cite news| date = March 6, 2008| title = Gary Gygax| work = [[The Times]]| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3491541.ece| accessdate = October 7, 2008| location=London| first=Sadie | last=Gray}}</ref><ref name=\"Sullivan\" /> He was named Ernest after his father, but he was commonly known as Gary, the middle name given to him by his mother after the actor [[Gary Cooper]].<ref name=\"witwer\" />{{rp|16}} The family lived on Kenmore Avenue, close enough to [[Wrigley Field]]<ref>{{cite web| title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part I, Page 19)| publisher = EN World| date = September 17, 2002| url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/22566-q-gary-gygax-part-i-19.html| accessdate = May 10, 2010|quote=I was born in Chicago about four blocks from Wrigley Field.}}</ref> that he could hear the roar of the crowds watching the [[Chicago Cubs]] play.<ref name=witwer>{{cite book | last = Witwer | first = Michael | title = Empire of the Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons & Dragons | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | date = 2015 | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-63286-279-2}}</ref>{{rp|15}} At age 7, he became a member of a small group of friends who called themselves the \"Kenmore Pirates\".

This group rapidly expanded to include Don Kaye, Rob Kuntz and eventually a large circle of players. Gygax sent the 50 pages of rules to his wargaming contacts and asked them to playtest the new game. Gygax and Arneson continued to trade notes about their respective campaigns, calling the amalgamation of Blackmoor and Greyhawk \"The Great Kingdom\". This collaboration gradually petered out as Gygax and Arneson realized their visions for the new game were diverging.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|100}}\n\nBased on the feedback he received, Gygax created a 150-page revision of the rules by mid-1973. Several aspects of the system governing magic in the game were inspired by [[The Dying Earth]] stories of fantasy author [[Jack Vance]] (notably the fact that ''magic-users'' in the game forget the spells that they have learned immediately upon casting them, and must re-study them in order to cast them again),<ref name=Gygax2001>{{cite web| last1=Gygax| first1=Gary| title=JACK VANCE & THE D&D GAME| url=http://www.dyingearth.com/files/gary%20gygax%20jack%20vance.pdf| website=Dying Earth Roleplaying Game Site| publisher=Pelgrane Press| accessdate=23 May 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610173333/http://www.dyingearth.com/files/gary%20gygax%20jack%20vance.pdf| archive-date=June 10, 2015| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}</ref> and the system as a whole drew upon the work of authors such as [[Robert E.

He had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his one-third share of the company, simply leaving his entire estate to his wife Donna.<ref name=\"QnA4\"/> Although she had worked briefly for TSR as an accountant, she had not shared her husband's enthusiasm for gaming, and made it clear that she would not be having anything to do with managing the company.

But TSR Hobbies had nothing to publish\u2014D&D was still owned by the 3-way partnership of TSR, and neither Gygax nor Blume had the money to buy out the shares owned by Kaye's wife. Blume persuaded a reluctant Gygax to allow his father, Melvin Blume, to buy Donna's shares, and those were converted to 200 shares in TSR Hobbies.<ref name=\"uiwgg\">{{cite web | title = The Ultimate Interview with Gary Gygax | url=http://www.thekyngdoms.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=37 | accessdate = March 23, 2010}}</ref> In addition, Brian bought another 140 shares.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|117}} These purchases reduced Gygax from the majority shareholder in control of the company to minority shareholder; he effectively became the Blumes' employee.<ref name=\"designers\" />{{rp|8}}\n\nGygax wrote the supplements ''[[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]]'', ''[[Eldritch Wizardry]]'', and ''[[Swords & Spells]]'' for the original ''D&D game''. With Brian Blume, Gygax also designed the [[Western (genre)|wild west]]-oriented role-playing game ''[[Boot Hill (role-playing game)|Boot Hill]]''. In the same year, Gygax created the magazine ''[[The Strategic Review]]'' with himself as editor.<ref name=\"longbio\" /> But wanting a more industry-wide periodical, he hired [[Tim Kask]] as TSR's first employee to change this magazine to the fantasy periodical ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'',<ref name=\"Parker2008\" /> with Gygax as writer, columnist, and publisher (from 1978 to 1981).<ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]] | volume = II | issue =13\u201324, 26\u201348 | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR Hobbies]] | date = April 1978 \u2013 April 1981}}</ref> ''The Dragon'' debuted in June 1976, and Gygax commented on its success years later: \"When I decided that ''The Strategic Review'' was not the right vehicle, hired Tim Kask as a magazine editor for Tactical Studies Rules, and named the new publication he was to produce ''The Dragon'', I thought we would eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide... At no time did I ever contemplate so great a success or so long a lifespan.\"<ref name=\"Dragon #248\" />\n\nIn 1976, TSR moved out of Gygax's house into its first professional home, known as \"The Dungeon Hobby Shop\".<ref name=\"designers\" />{{rp|8}} Dave Arneson was hired as part of the creative staff, but was let go after only 10 months, another sign that Gygax and Arneson still had creative differences over D&D.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|129}}\n\n=== ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' and Hollywood===\nThe ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'', released in 1977, was an introductory version of the original ''D&D'' geared towards new players and edited by [[John Eric Holmes|J. Eric Holmes]].<ref name=\"30 Years\" /> But in the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of ''D&D'', ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (''AD&D''). The ''[[Monster Manual]]'', released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed.<ref name=\"history\" /> The ''AD&D'' rules were not fully compatible with those of the ''D&D Basic Set'' and as a result, ''D&D'' and ''AD&D'' became distinct product lines.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|135}} Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all ''D&D'' products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on ''AD&D'' books, claiming it was a new and different property. In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD&D products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income for the next decade.<ref name=\"witwer\" />{{rp|139}}\n\nGygax wrote the ''AD&D'' hardcovers ''[[Players Handbook]]'', ''[[Dungeon Masters Guide]]'',<!-- (sic) \u2013 no apostrophes --> ''Monster Manual,'' and ''[[Monster Manual II]]''. Gygax also wrote or co-wrote numerous ''AD&D'' and basic ''D&D'' [[Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)|adventure modules]], including ''[[The Keep on the Borderlands]]'', ''[[Tomb of Horrors]]'', ''[[Expedition to the Barrier Peaks]]'', ''[[The Temple of Elemental Evil]]'', ''[[The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun]]'', ''[[Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure]]'', ''[[Isle of the Ape]]'', and all seven of the modules later combined into ''[[Queen of the Spiders]]''. In 1980, Gygax's long-time campaign setting of [[Greyhawk]] was published in the form of the ''[[World of Greyhawk Fantasy World Setting]]'' folio, which was expanded in 1983 into the ''[[World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting]]'' boxed set. Sales of the ''D&D'' game reached {{USD|8.5 million}} in 1980.<ref name=\"TheTimesObit\" /> Gygax also provided assistance on the [[Gamma World]] science fantasy role-playing game in 1981 and co-authored the Gamma World adventure ''[[Legion of Gold]]''.\n\nIn 1979, a [[Michigan State University]] student, [[James Dallas Egbert III]], allegedly disappeared into the school's steam tunnels while playing a live-action version of ''D&D''. In fact, Egbert was discovered in Louisiana several weeks later,<ref name=witwer />{{rp|145}} but negative mainstream media attention focused on ''D&D'' as the cause. In 1982, [[Patricia Pulling]]'s son killed himself. Blaming ''D&D'' for her son's suicide, Pulling formed an organization named B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons) to attack the game and the company that produced it. Gygax defended the game on a segment of ''[[60 Minutes]]'',<ref name=\"Sullivan\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=Bob Blahloblaw|title=60 Minutes on Dungeons and Dragons|date=2015-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN_nuxOhT2s|accessdate=2016-08-12}}</ref> which aired in 1985. When death threats started arriving at the TSR office, Gygax hired a bodyguard.<ref name=\"TheTimesObit\" /><ref name=\"Wired\" /> Despite the negative publicity, or perhaps because of it, TSR's annual ''D&D'' sales increased in 1982 to {{USD|16 million}},<ref name=\"Wired\" /> and in January 1983, ''[[The New York Times]]'' speculated that ''D&D'' might become \"the great game of the 1980s\" in the same manner that ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' was emblematic of the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=January 19, 1983|page=A.22|issn=0362-4331|title=Topics; Updates; Playing Games; [Editorial]|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=949078371&sid=4&Fmt=3&clientId=20886&RQT=309&VName=PQD|accessdate=December 19, 2008}} (Registration required)</ref>\n\nBrian Blume persuaded Gygax to allow Brian's brother Kevin to purchase Melvin Blume's shares. This gave the Blume brothers a controlling interest,<ref name=\"uiwgg\" /> and by 1981, Gygax and the Blumes were increasingly at loggerheads over management of the company. Gygax's frustrations at work, and increased prosperity from his generous royalty cheques brought a number of changes to his personal life. He and Mary Jo had been active members of the local Jehovah's Witnesses, but others in the congregation already felt uneasy about Gygax's smoking and drinking; his connection to the \"satanic\" game of D&D caused enough friction that the Gygaxes finally disassociated themselves from Jehovah's Witnesses.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|156}} Mary Jo, continuing to resent the amount of time her husband spent \"playing games\", had begun to drink excessively, and the couple argued frequently. Gygax, who had started smoking marijuana when he lost his insurance job in 1970, started to use cocaine, and had a number of extramarital affairs. Finally in 1983, the two had an acrimonious divorce.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|187}}\n\nAt the same time, the Blumes, wanting to get Gygax out of Lake Geneva so they could manage the company without his \"interference\", split TSR Hobbies into TSR, Inc., and TSR Entertainment, Inc. Gygax became the President of TSR Entertainment, Inc.,<ref name=\"Dragon #103\" /> and the Blumes sent him to Hollywood to develop TV and movie opportunities.<ref name=\"designers\" />{{rp|13}} He became co-producer of the licensed [[Dungeons & Dragons (TV series)|''D&D'' cartoon series]] for [[CBS]],<ref name=\"gamespy2.1\" /> which led its time slot for two years.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\" />\n\nGygax, newly single, took advantage of his time on the West Coast, renting an immense mansion, increasing his cocaine use, and spending time with several young starlets.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|168}}\n\n=== Leaving TSR ===\nBecause he was occupied with getting a movie off the ground in Hollywood, Gygax had to leave the day-to-day operations of TSR to Kevin and Brian Blume.<ref name=\"Wired\" /> In 1984, after months of negotiation, he reached an agreement with [[Orson Welles]] to star in a D&D movie, and [[John Boorman]] to act as producer and director. But almost at the same time, he received word that back in Lake Geneva, TSR had run into severe financial difficulties and Kevin Blume was shopping the company for {{USD|6 million}}.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|171}}\n\nGygax immediately discarded his movie ambitions\u2014his ''D&D'' movie would never be made\u2014and flew back to Lake Geneva. There, he discovered to his shock that although industry leader TSR was grossing {{USD|30 million}}, it was barely breaking even;<ref name=witwer />{{rp|171}} it was in fact {{USD|1.5 million}} in debt and teetering on the edge of insolvency.<ref name=\"Wired\" /> After investigating the reasons why, Gygax brought his findings to the five other company directors. (Since 1982, TSR Inc. had conformed to the recommendations of the [[American Management Association]] by adding three \"outside\" directors to the board, increasing its size to six.) Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th century shipwreck.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|172}} Gygax demanded that Kevin Blume be removed as company president, and the three outside directors agreed with him. However, the board still believed the financial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to stay in control, in March 1985, Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and rather than selling the company, he took steps to produce new revenue generating products. To that end, he contacted Dave Arneson with a view to produce some Blackmoor material. He also bet heavily on a new AD&D book, ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'', a compilation of material culled from Dragon Magazine articles. And he quickly wrote a novel set in his Greyhawk setting, ''[[Saga of Old City]]'', featuring a protagonist called Gord the Rogue. In order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, [[Lorraine Williams]].\n\nWhen ''Unearthed Arcana'' was released in July, Gygax's bet paid off, as the new book sold 90,000 copies in the first month. His novel also sold well, and he immediately published a sequel, ''[[Artifact of Evil]]''. The financial crisis had been averted, but ironically Gygax had paved the way for his own downfall. In October 1985, the new manager, Lorraine Williams, revealed that she had purchased all of the shares of Kevin and Brian Blume\u2014after Brian had triggered his own 700-share option. Williams was now the majority shareholder, and replaced Gygax as president and CEO. She also made it clear that Gygax would be making no further creative contributions to TSR. Several of his projects were immediately shelved and never published. Gygax took TSR to court in a bid to block the Blumes' sale of their shares to Williams, but he lost.<ref name=\"Dragon122\">Gygax, Gary 1987. \"From the Sorcerer's Scroll\", ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' 122:40 (Jun 1987)</ref>\n\nSales of ''D&D'' reached {{USD|29 million}} in 1985,<ref name=\"TheTimesObit\" /> but Gygax, seeing his future at TSR as untenable,<ref name=\"gamespy2.1\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538820p1.html|title=Gary Gygax Interview \u2013 Part 2 (page 1)|accessdate=October 3, 2008|date=August 16, 2004 |last=Rausch|first=Allen|work=[[GameSpy]]|publisher=IGN Entertainment|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5bJG7F1Yq?url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538820p1.html |archivedate=October 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> resigned all positions with TSR, Inc. in October 1986, and settled his disputes with TSR in December 1986.<ref name=\"Dragon122\" /> By the terms of his settlement with TSR, Gygax kept the rights to Gord the Rogue as well as all ''D&D'' characters whose names were anagrams or plays on his own name (for example, Yrag and Zagyg).<ref>{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part IX, Page 91) | publisher = EN World | date = October 20, 2005| url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/125997-gary-gygax-q-part-ix-91.html | accessdate = March 15, 2009|quote=Anagrams of my name are exclusively my property according to my settlement agreement with TSR, so that is how I can use Zagyg, or Zagig, as well as Yrag.}}</ref> However, he lost the rights to all his other work, including the ''World of Greyhawk'' and the names of all the characters he had ever used in TSR material, such as [[Mordenkainen]], [[Robilar]], and [[Tenser]].\n\n== After TSR ==\n\n=== 1985\u20131989: New Infinities Productions, Inc. ===\nImmediately after leaving TSR, Gygax was approached by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|188}} Gygax, who was tired of company management, was simply looking for some way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision for a new gaming company.

They also began working on a third line of products, which began with an adventure written by Mentzer called ''The Convert'' (1987); Mentzer had written the adventure as an RPGA tournament for ''D&D'', but TSR was not interested in publishing it. Mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with New Infinities, but since the permission was not in writing TSR filed an injunction to prevent the adventure's sale, although the injunction was later lifted.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|238}}<ref name=witwer />{{rp|190}} The legal costs further drained NIPI of capital.\n\nDuring all of this drama, Gygax became a father again. Over the past year, he had formed a romantic relationship with Gail Carpenter, his former assistant at TSR. In November 1986, she gave birth to Gygax's sixth child, Alex. Biographer Michael Witwer believes the birth of Alex forced Gygax to reconsider the equation of work, gaming and family that, up until this time, had been dominated by work and gaming. \"Gary, keenly aware that he had made mistakes as a father, and husband in the past, was determined not to make them again... Gary was also a realist, and knew what good fatherhood would demand, especially at his age.\"<ref name=witwer />{{rp|189}} On August 15, 1987, on what would have been his parents' 50th wedding anniversary, Gygax married Gail Carpenter.<ref name=\"telegraph\" />\n\nDuring 1987 and 1988, Gygax worked with [[Flint Dille]] on the ''[[Sagard the Barbarian]]'' books,<ref name=\"Sullivan\" /> as well as ''Role-Playing Mastery'' and its sequel, ''Master of the Game''.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|191}} He also wrote two more Gord the Rogue novels, ''City of Hawks'' (1987), and ''Come Endless Darkness'' (1988). However, by 1988, TSR had rewritten the setting for the world of Greyhawk, and Gygax was not happy with the new direction in which TSR was taking \"his\" creation. In a literary declaration that his old world was dead, and wanting to make a clean break with all things Greyhawk, Gygax destroyed his version of [[Oerth]] in the final Gord the Rogue novel, ''Dance of Demons''.<ref>Q: \"After you left TSR, you finished the Gord the Rogue books. At the end of the cycle, Oerth bites the bullet. Was this your way of saying that Greyhawk is dead and that fans should turn away from TSR's version with disdain?\" Gygax: \"More my way of saying that since T$R had killed the setting with trash releases, it was time to wipe out the shame by obliterating the setting.\"{{cite web| title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part VII, page 2)| publisher = EN World| date = November 19, 2004| url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/104817-gary-gygax-q-part-vii-2.html | accessdate = March 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith the Gord the Rogue novels finished, NIPI's main source of steady income dried up. The company needed a new product. Gygax announced in 1988 in a company newsletter that he and Rob Kuntz, his co-Dungeon Master during the early days of the Greyhawk campaign, were working as a team again. This time they would create a new multi-genre fantasy RPG called \"Infinite Adventures\", which would be supported by different gamebooks for different genres.<ref name=\"designers\" />{{rp|61}} This line would detail the Castle and City of Greyhawk as Gygax and Kuntz had originally envisioned them, now called \"Castle Dunfalcon\".<ref name=\"designers\" />{{rp|239}}\n\nHowever, before work on this project could commence, NIPI ran out of money, was forced into bankruptcy, and was dissolved in 1989.<ref name=\"designers\" />{{rp|239}}\n\n=== 1990\u20131994: ''Dangerous Journeys'' ===\nAfter NIPI folded, Gygax decided to create an entirely new RPG called ''The Carpenter Project'',<ref name=\"designers\" />{{rp|61}} one considerably more complex and \"rule heavy\" than his original and relatively simple ''D&D'' system, which had been encompassed by a mere 150 typewritten pages.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|194}} He also wanted to create a horror setting for the new RPG called ''Unhallowed''.

So in addition to his work on the RPG and the ''Mythus'' setting, Gygax wrote three novels, released under publisher [[Penguin Books|Penguin/Roc]] and later reprinted by [[Paizo Publishing]]: ''The Anubis Murders'', ''The Samarkand Solution'', and ''Death in Delhi''.\n\nIn late 1992, the ''Dangerous Journeys'' RPG was released by Games Designer Workshop,<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite news| last = Sullivan | first = Patricia| date = March 5, 2008| title = E.

In an analogous way to the [[Governor-General of Australia]] at the national level, the [[Governors of the Australian states]] perform constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level. The governor is appointed by the queen on the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the [[premier of New South Wales]],<ref name=Mon>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Australia/TheQueensroleinAustralia.aspx |last=The Royal Household |title=The Queen and the Commonwealth > Queen and Australia > The Queen's role in Australia |publisher=Queen's Printer |accessdate=19 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417055732/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchandCommonwealth/Australia/TheQueensroleinAustralia.aspx |archivedate=17 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> for an unfixed period of time\u2014known as serving ''[[At Her Majesty's pleasure]]''\u2014though five years is the norm. The current governor is retired General [[David Hurley]], who succeeded [[Marie Bashir|Dame Marie Bashir]] on 2 October 2014.\n\nThe office has its origin in the 18th-century colonial governors of [[New South Wales]] upon its settlement in 1788, and is the oldest continuous institution in Australia. The present incarnation of the position emerged with the [[Federation of Australia]] and the ''New South Wales Constitution Act 1902'', which defined the viceregal office as the governor acting by and with the advice of the [[Executive Council of New South Wales]].<ref name=Con>{{Citation| last=| author-link=NSW Parliament| publication-date=| title=Constitution Act, 1902| series=| publication-place=Sydney| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1902188/| accessdate=19 August 2010| ref=}}</ref> However, the post still ultimately represented the [[Her Majesty's Government|government of the United Kingdom]] until, after continually decreasing involvement by the British government, the passage in 1942 of the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]] (see [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]) and the [[Australia Act 1986]], after which the governor became the direct, personal representative of the uniquely Australian sovereign.\n\n==Appointment==\n[[File:John Northcott AWM 107728.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sir John Northcott, the first Australian-born person appointed as governor (1946\u201357).]]\nThe Office of Governor is required by the New South Wales Constitution Act, 1902. The [[Monarchy of Australia|Australian monarch]], on the advice and recommendation of the [[premier of New South Wales]], approves the appointment of governor with a commission issued under the [[royal sign-manual]] and Public Seal of the State, who is from then until being sworn in by the premier and chief justice referred to as the ''governor-designate''.\n\nBesides the administration of the oaths of office, there is no set formula for the swearing-in of a governor-designate. The constitution act stipulates that: \"Before assuming office, a person appointed to be Governor shall take the Oath or Affirmation of Allegiance and the Oath or Affirmation of Office in the presence of the Chief Justice or another Judge of the Supreme Court.\"<ref name=Con/> The sovereign will also hold an [[Audience (meeting)|audience]] with the appointee and will at that time induct the governor-designate as a [[Order of Australia|Companion of the Order of Australia]] (AC).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe incumbent will generally serve for at least five years, though this is only a developed convention, and the governor still technically acts [[at Her Majesty's pleasure]] (or the ''Royal Pleasure''). The premier may therefore recommend to the queen that the viceroy remain in her service for a longer period of time, sometimes upwards of more than seven years. A governor may also resign{{refn|[[David Martin (Governor)|Sir David Martin]] resigned the viceregal post on 7 August 1990 due to health concerns. He died three days later.|group=n|name=Term1}} and three have died in office.{{refn|The following governors died in office: [[Robert Duff (politician, born 1835)|Sir Robert Duff]] on 15 March 1895; [[Walter Edward Davidson|Sir Walter Davidson]] on 15 September 1923; and [[David Anderson (Australian governor)|Sir David Anderson]] on 30 October 1936.|group=n|name=Term2}} In such a circumstance, or if the governor leaves the country for longer than one month, the [[Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales|lieutenant governor of New South Wales]], concurrently held by the [[Chief Justice of New South Wales|chief justice of New South Wales]] since 1872, serves as [[Administrator of the Government]] and exercises all powers of the governor.{{refn|When Sir David Anderson died in office on 30 October 1936, the lieutenant governor, [[Philip Whistler Street|Sir Philip Street]], served as Administrator until [[John Loder, 2nd Baron Wakehurst|Lord Wakehurst]] was sworn in on 8 April 1937.|group=n|name=Term3}} Furthermore, if the lieutenant governor becomes incapacitated while serving in the office of governor or is also absent from the state, the next most senior judge of the Supreme Court is sworn in as the administrator.{{refn|[[Leslie Herron|Sir Leslie Herron]], the lieutenant governor, died suddenly in May 1973 while the governor, Sir Roden Cutler, was overseas.

Historian [[A.J.P. Taylor]] once noted that \"going out and governing New South Wales became the British aristocracy's 'abiding consolation'\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Taylor, A. J.

Coincidentally the first Australian-born governor, [[John Northcott|Sir John Northcott]] on 1 August 1946, was also the first Australian-born governor of any state. However, as Northcott was born in Victoria, it was not until [[Eric Woodward|Sir Eric Woodward]]'s appointment by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957 that the position was filled by a New South Welshman; this practice continued until 1996, when Queen Elizabeth II commissioned as her representative [[Gordon Samuels]], a London-born immigrant to Australia.\n\nAlthough required by the tenets of [[constitutional monarchy]] to be [[non-partisan]] while in office, governors were frequently former politicians, many being members of the [[House of Lords]] by virtue of their peerage. The first governors were all military officers and the majority of governors since have come from a military background, numbering 19. Samuels was the first governor in New South Wales history without either a political, public service or military background, being a former justice of the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]]. The first woman to hold this position is also the first Lebanese-Australian governor, [[Marie Bashir|Dame Marie Bashir]].\n\n==Role==\nAs Australia [[Personal union|shares its monarch]] equally with [[Commonwealth realm|fifteen other countries]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the sovereign lives predominantly outside New South Wales' borders, the governor's primary task is to perform the sovereign's constitutional duties on his or her behalf, acting within the principles of [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[responsible government]] as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and as a [[nonpartisan]] safeguard against the abuse of power. For the most part, however, the powers of the Crown are exercised on a day-to-day basis by elected and appointed individuals, leaving the governor to perform the various ceremonial duties the sovereign otherwise carries out when in the country; at such a moment, the governor removes him or herself from public, though the presence of the monarch does not affect the governor's ability to perform governmental roles.\n[[File:Lord wakehust arrives.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Loder, 2nd Baron Wakehurst|The Lord Wakehurst]] takes the oath of office upon his arrival in Sydney in 1937.]]\nIt is the governor who is required by the Constitution Act 1902, to appoint persons to the [[Government of New South Wales]], who are all theoretically tasked with tendering to the monarch and viceroy guidance on the exercise of the Royal Prerogative. Convention dictates, that the governor must draw from the Parliament an individual to act as premier, who is also capable of forming government\u2014in almost all cases the Member of Parliament who commands the [[Confidence and supply|confidence]] of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]]. The premier then directs the governor to appoint other members of parliament to the [[Executive Council of New South Wales]] known as the [[New South Wales Ministry|Cabinet]], and it is in practice only from this group of [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]] that the queen and governor will take direction on the use of executive power, an arrangement called the ''[[Queen-in-Council]]'' or, more specifically, the ''Governor-in-Council''. In this capacity, the governor will issue royal [[proclamation]]s and sign [[Order in Council|orders in council]]. The governor-in-council is also required to appoint in the queen's name the [[President of the New South Wales Legislative Council|President of the Legislative Council]], the [[Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Speaker of the Legislative Assembly]], Supreme Court and [[District Court of New South Wales|District Court]] justices, and local court magistrates in the state, though all of these are made on the advice of either the premier and cabinet or the majority of elected members of each house in the case of the Speaker or President. The [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] given by the Cabinet is, in order to ensure the stability of government, typically binding; both the queen and her viceroy, however, may in exceptional circumstances invoke the [[reserve powers]], which remain the Crown's final check against a ministry's abuse of power, this was last fully exercised in 1932, when [[Philip Game|Sir Philip Game]] revoked the commission of Premier [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]].\n\nThe governor alone is constitutionally mandated to summon [[Parliament of New South Wales|parliament]]. Beyond that, the viceroy carries out the other conventional parliamentary duties in the sovereign's absence, including reading the [[Speech from the throne]] and the proroguing and [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolving]] of parliament. The governor grants [[Royal Assent]] in the queen's name; legally, he or she has three options: grant Royal Assent (making the bill law), withhold Royal Assent (vetoing the bill), or reserve the bill for the queen's pleasure (allowing the sovereign to personally grant or withhold assent). If the governor withholds the queen's assent, the sovereign may within two years disallow the bill, thereby annulling the law in question. No modern viceroy has denied Royal Assent to a bill. With most constitutional functions delegated to Cabinet, the governor acts in a primarily ceremonial fashion. He or she will host members of [[Monarchy of Australia#Australian Royal Family|Australia's royal family]], as well as foreign royalty and heads of state. Also as part of international relations, the governor receives [[Letter of credence|letters of credence and of recall]] from foreign consuls-general appointed to Sydney. When they are the longest-serving state governor, the governor of New South Wales holds a [[dormant commission]] to act as the [[Administrator (Australia)|Administrator of the Commonwealth]] when the [[Governor-General of Australia]] is absent from Australia, a role most recently held by Governor Bashir.<ref>[http://www.ag.gov.au/portal/govgazonline.nsf/85B98B2949AD84ACCA256D580002A424/$file/S205.pdf Commonwealth of Australia Gazette S205 dated 17 June 2003]</ref>\n\nThe governor is also tasked with fostering unity and pride. He or she will also induct individuals into the various [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Australia|national orders]] and present national medals and decorations, however the most senior awards such as ACs or the Victoria Cross are the sole prerogative of the governor general. The governor also ''ex-officio'' serves as Honorary [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] of the [[Royal New South Wales Regiment]] (since 1960) and as Honorary [[Air Commodore]] of [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|No. 22 (City of Sydney) Squadron]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (since 1937), as well as the [[Scouting and Guiding in New South Wales|Chief Scout for New South Wales]].<ref name=\"patron\">{{cite web|title=Patronage Listing|url=https://www.governor.nsw.gov.au/governor/patronages/patronage-listing/|website=Governor of New South Wales|publisher=Office of the Governor|accessdate=7 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Symbols and protocol==\n[[Image:Flag of the Governor of New South Wales.svg|thumb|250px|The present standard, adopted on 15 January 1981.]]\nAs the personal representative of the monarch, the governor follows only the sovereign in the NSW order of precedence. The incumbent governor is entitled to use the style of ''His'' or ''Her [[Excellency]]'', while in office.

Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] assumed office as Governor of New South Wales on 7 February 1788, when the Colony of New South Wales, the first British settlement in Australia, was formally proclaimed. The early colonial governors held an almost autocratic power due to the distance from and poor communications with Great Britain, until 1824 when the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], Australia's first legislative body, was appointed to advise the governor.<ref>NSW Parliament.

All communication between the Australian colonies and the British Government was meant to go through the governor-general, and the other colonies had lieutenant-governors. As South Australia (1836), [[Tasmania]] (January 1855) and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (May 1855) obtained responsible government, their lieutenant-governors were replaced by governors. Although he had ceased acting as a governor-general, [[William Denison|Sir William Denison]] retained the title until his retirement in 1861.<ref>{{cite book |last=Twomey |first=Anne |title=The chameleon Crown: The Queen and her Australian governors |url=http://www.federationpress.com.au/bookstore/book.asp?isbn=9781862876293 |year=2006 |publisher=The Federation Press |location=Sydney |isbn=978-1-86287-629-3 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Federation Pavillion.jpg|thumb|left|Federation Pavilion in Sydney on 1 January 1901: the lieutenant governor and chief justice of New South Wales administered the oath of office to the first governor-general of the new commonwealth.]]\nThe six British colonies in Australia joined together to form the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901. New South Wales and the other colonies became states in the federal system under the [[Constitution of Australia]]. In 1902, the ''New South Wales Constitution Act'' 1902 confirmed the modern system of government of New South Wales as a state, including defining the role of the governor as the monarch's representative, who acts by and with the advice of the Executive Council. Like the new federal [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] and the other state governors, in the first years after federation, the governor of New South Wales continued to act both as a constitutional head of the state, and as a liaison between the government and the imperial government in [[London]]. However, the British government's involvement in Australian affairs gradually reduced in the next few years.\n\n[[File:Australia Act 1986.jpg|thumb|right|The copy of the Australia Act 1986 (UK) bearing the Queen's signature, now displayed in [[Canberra]].]]\nIn 1942, the Commonwealth of Australia passed the ''[[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]]'', which rendered Australia dominion status under the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], and while Australia and Britain share the same person as monarch, that person acts in a distinct capacity when acting as the monarch of each dominion. The convention that the monarch acts in respect of Australian affairs on the advice of his or her Australian ministers, rather than his or her British ministers, became enshrined in law.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} For New South Wales however, because the Statute of Westminster did not disturb the constitutional arrangements of the Australian states, the governor remains (at least formally) in New South Wales the representative of the British monarch. This arrangement seemed incongruous with the Commonwealth of Australia's independent dominion status conferred by the Statute of Westminster, and with the federal structure. After much negotiation between the federal and state governments of Australia, the British government and [[Buckingham Palace]], the ''[[Australia Act 1986]]'' removed any remaining constitutional roles of the British monarch and British government in the Australian states, and established that the governor of New South Wales (along with the other state governors) was the direct, personal representative of the Australian monarch, and not the British monarch or the British government, nor the Governor-General of Australia or the Australian federal government.\n\n==Residences and household==\n===Government House===\n{{main|Government House, Sydney|First Government House, Sydney}}\n[[File:Government House in Sydney.jpg|right|thumb|[[Government House, Sydney]], the official residence of the governor]]\nOn his arrival in Sydney in 1788, Governor Phillip resided in a temporary wood and canvas house before the construction of [[First Government House, Sydney|a more substantial house]] on a site now bounded by [[Bridge Street, Sydney|Bridge Street]] and [[Phillip Street, Sydney]]. This first Government House was extended and repaired by the following eight governors, but was generally in poor condition and was vacated when the governor relocated to the new building in 1845, designed by [[Edward Blore]] and [[Mortimer Lewis]].\n\nWith the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, it was announced that Government House was to serve as the secondary residence of the new [[Governor-General of Australia]]. As a consequence the NSW Government leased the residence of [[Cranbrook, Bellevue Hill]] as the residence of the governor. This arrangement lasted until 1913 when the NSW Government terminated the Commonwealth lease of Government House (the governor-general moved to the new Sydney residence of [[Admiralty House, Sydney|Admiralty House]]), the governor from 1913 to 1917, [[Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland|Sir Gerald Strickland]], continued to live in Cranbrook and on his departure his successor returned to Government House.\n\nOn 16 January 1996, Premier Bob Carr announced that the next governor would be [[Gordon Samuels]], that he would not live or work at Government House and that he would retain his appointment as chairman of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. On these changes, Carr said: \"The Office of the Governor should be less associated with pomp and ceremony, less encumbered by anachronistic protocol, more in tune with the character of the people.\"<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kY-Tk0-quyoC&lpg=PA165&ots=E9KBRcKIFB&dq=%22The%20Office%20of%20the%20Governor%20should%20be%20less%20associated%20with%20pomp%20and%20ceremony%2C%20less%20encumbered%20by%20anachronistic%20protocol%2C%20more%20in%20tune%20with%20the%20character%20of%20the%20people.%22&pg=PA165#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Office%20of%20the%20Governor%20should%20be%20less%20associated%20with%20pomp%20and%20ceremony,%20less%20encumbered%20by%20anachronistic%20protocol,%20more%20in%20tune%20with%20the%20character%20of%20the%20people.%22&f=true ''The Queen's Other Realms: The Crown and Its Legacy in Australia, Canada and New Zealand''], Peter John Boyce, Federation Press, 2008, page 165</ref> The state's longest-serving governor, [[Roden Cutler|Sir Roden Cutler]], was also reported as saying: \"It's a political push to make way in New South Wales to lead the push for a republic.

In 1790, Governor Phillip had a secondary residence built in the township of [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]]. In 1799 the second governor, [[John Hunter (New South Wales)|John Hunter]], had the remains of Arthur Phillip's cottage cleared away, and [[Old Government House, Parramatta|a more permanent building]] erected on the same site. This residence remained occupied until the completion of the primary Government House in 1845, however the hard summers and growing size of Sydney convinced successive governors of the need for a rural residence.\n\nThe governor from 1868 to 1872, [[Somerset Lowry-Corry, 4th Earl Belmore|The Earl Belmore]], used Throsby Park in [[Moss Vale, New South Wales|Moss Vale]] as his summer residence. His successor, [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Sir Hercules Robinson]], often retired privately to the same area, in the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]], for the same reason. In 1879 it was then decided that the colony should purchase a house at [[Sutton Forest, New South Wales|Sutton Forest]] for use as a permanent summer residence, and in 1881 the NSW Government purchased for \u00a36000 a property known as \"Prospect\" that had been built by Robert Pemberton Richardson (of the firm Richardson & Wrench). This was renamed \"[[Hillview, Sutton Forest|Hillview]]\", and became the primary summer governor's residence from 1885 to 1957. In 1957, seen as unnecessary and expensive, Hillview was put up for sale and purchased from the state government by Edwin Klein. Hillview was returned to the people of NSW in 1985 and is currently leased under the ownership of the [[Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)|Office of Environment and Heritage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bowral.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/heritage-dispute-over-sutton-forest-mansion-hillview/1643291.aspx?storypage=0|title=Heritage dispute over Sutton Forest mansion Hillview|publisher=Southern highland News|accessdate=19 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709053528/http://bowral.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/heritage-dispute-over-sutton-forest-mansion-hillview/1643291.aspx?storypage=0|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Household===\nThe viceregal household aids the governor in the execution of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties and is managed by the Office of the Governor, whose current [[Official Secretary to the Governor of New South Wales|Official Secretary and Chief of Staff]] is Colonel Michael Miller RFD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.nsw.gov.au|title= Governor of New South Wales Official Website|accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> These organised offices and support systems include [[Aide-de-camp#Australia|aides-de-camp]], [[News media|press officers]], financial managers, speech writers, trip organisers, event planners and protocol officers, chefs and other kitchen employees, waiters, and various cleaning staff, as well as tour guides.

The governor performs the same constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level as does the [[Governor-General of Australia]] at the federal level. The governor's office and official residence is [[Government House, Melbourne|Government House]] next to the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne|Royal Botanic Gardens]] and surrounded by [[Kings Domain, Melbourne|Kings Domain]] in [[Melbourne]].\n\nThe Governor of Victoria is appointed by the Queen of Australia on the advice of the [[Premier of Victoria]]. The current Governor of Victoria is former judge [[Linda Dessau]], Victoria's first female governor.<ref name=dessau>{{cite news|last1=Willingham|first1=Richard|title=Linda Dessau will become Victoria's first female Governor|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/linda-dessau-will-become-victorias-first-female-governor-20150211-13bjn8.html|accessdate=12 February 2015|work=The Age|date=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Powers==\nIn accordance with the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] of parliamentary government, the governor nearly always acts solely on the advice of the head of the elected government, the [[Premier of Victoria]]. Nevertheless, the governor retains the [[reserve powers]] of the Crown, and has the right to dismiss the premier.<ref>''Constitution of Victoria'' (1975), Part 1.</ref>\n\n==Role of governor==\nThe Governor of Victoria is appointed by the [[Queen of Australia]], on the advice of the Premier of Victoria, to act as her representative as head of state in Victoria.<ref name=Role>[http://www.governor.vic.gov.au/victorias-governor/role-of-the-governor Role of the governor]</ref> The Governor acts \"[[At Her Majesty's pleasure|at the Queen's pleasure]]\", meaning that the term of the Governor can be terminated at any time by the Queen acting upon the advice of the premier.\n\nSince the [[Australia Act 1986|Australia Acts of 1986]], it is the governor, and not the queen, who exercises all the powers of the head of state, and the governor is not subject to the direction or supervision of the monarch, but acts upon the advice of the premier. Upon appointment, he or she becomes a [[viceroy]]. The governor's main responsibilities fall into three categories \u2013  constitutional, ceremonial and community engagement.<ref name=Role />\n\n==Governor's Personal Standard==\n[[Image:Flag of the Governor of Victoria.svg|thumb|right|260px|Standard of the Governor of Victoria]]\n\nThe Personal Standard of the Governor of Victoria is the same design as the [[Flag of Victoria (Australia)|State Flag of Victoria]], but with the blue background replaced by gold, and red stars depicting the Southern Cross. Above the Southern Cross is the Royal Crown.\n\nThe current standard has been in place since 1984. Previously, the standard used by Victorian governors after 1870 had been the [[Union Jack]] with the Badge of the State of Victoria emblazoned in the centre.<ref name=Standard>[http://www.governor.vic.gov.au/victorias-governor/symbols-and-emblems The Governor's Standard]</ref> Between 1903 and 1953, the [[Tudor Crown]] was used on the State Flag and Governor's Standard, and this was changed to the present crown in 1954.\n\nThe Governor\u2019s Standard is flown at Government House and on vehicles conveying the governor. The Standard is lowered over Government House when the governor is absent from Victoria.<ref name=Standard />\n\n==Related offices==\nThere is also a lieutenant-governor and an administrator. The [[List of Judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria|Chief Justice of Victoria]] is ''ex officio'' the Administrator, unless he or she is the lieutenant-governor, in which case, the next most senior judge is the administrator. The lieutenant-governor takes on the responsibilities of the governor when that post is vacant or when the governor is out of the state or unable to act. The administrator takes on those duties if both the governor and lieutenant-governor are not able to act for the above reasons.\n\nSee [[Governors of the Australian states]] for a description and history of the office of governor.\n\n==Australianisation of the office==\nAs with the other states, until the 1986 [[Australia Acts]], the office of Governor of Victoria was an appointment of the British Foreign Office although local advice was considered and sometimes accepted. \n\nUntil the appointment of Victorian-born Sir [[Henry Winneke]] in 1974, the Governors of Victoria were British. Since then, governors have been Australian although several were born overseas, namely [[Davis McCaughey|Dr Davis McCaughey]], born in Ireland, came to Australia for work; and [[David de Kretser|Professor David de Kretser]], born in [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]), and  [[Alex Chernov]], born in [[Lithuania]], both of whom came to Australia while at school.\n\n==List of Governors of Victoria==\n[[Image:Flag of the Governor of Victoria (1953-1984).svg|thumb|right|260px|Standard of the Governor of Victoria (1903\u20131984). Prior to 1953, a [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor Crown]] was used]]\n\n===Lieutenant-governors===\nPrior to the separation of the colony of Victoria from New South Wales in 1851, the area was called the [[Port Phillip District]] of [[New South Wales]]. The Governor of New South Wales appointed superintendents of the District. In 1839 Charles La Trobe was appointed superintendent. La Trobe became Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria on separation on 1 July 1851.\n\nBetween 1850 and 1861, the [[Governor of New South Wales]] was titled Governor-General of New South Wales, in an attempt to form a federal structure. Until Victoria obtained responsible government in 1855, the Governor-General of New South Wales appointed lieutenant-governors to Victoria.<ref>{{cite book |last=Twomey |first=Anne |title=The chameleon Crown: The Queen and her Australian governors |url=http://www.federationpress.com.au/bookstore/book.asp?isbn=9781862876293 |year=2006 |publisher=The Federation Press |location=Sydney |isbn=978-1-86287-629-3 }}</ref> On Victoria obtaining responsible government in May 1855, the title of the then incumbent lieutenant-governor, [[Captain Sir Charles Hotham]], became governor.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n! width=\"4%\"| '''No.'''\n! width=\"10%\"| '''Image'''\n! width=\"50%\"| '''Lieutenant-governor'''\n! width=\"20%\"| '''From'''\n! width=\"20%\"| '''To'''\n|-\n| 1\n| [[Image:Charleslatrobe.jpg|80px]]\n| [[Charles La Trobe|Captain Charles La Trobe]]\n| 1 July 1851\n| 5 May 1854\n|-\n| 2\n| [[File:Charles Hotham by James Henry Lynch-crop.jpg|80px]]\n| [[Charles Hotham|Captain Sir Charles Hotham KCB RN]]\n| 22 June 1854\n| 22 May 1855\n|}\n\n===Governors===\n{| style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n! width=\"4%\"| '''No.'''\n! width=\"8%\"| '''Image'''\n! width=\"30%\"| '''Governor'''\n! width=\"20%\"| '''From'''\n! width=\"20%\"| '''To'''\n! width=\"20%\"| '''Notes'''\n|-\n| 1\n| [[File:Charles Hotham by James Henry Lynch-crop.jpg|80px]]\n| [[Charles Hotham|Captain Sir Charles Hotham]] [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Royal Navy|RN]] \n| 22 May 1855\n| 31 December 1855\n| [[Edward Macarthur]] was administrator from January to December 1856<ref>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Hill|first=A.

If there is no governor or if the governor is unavailable to act for a substantial period, the lieutenant-governor assumes office as administrator and exercises all the powers and functions of the governor. \n\nIf expecting to be unavailable for a short period only, the governor with the consent of the premier, usually commissions the lieutenant-governor to act as deputy for the governor, performing some or all of the powers and functions of the governor.<ref>[http://www.vic.gov.au/contactsandservices/directory/?ea0_lfz99_120.&organizationalRole&cc1d2cba-356a-4f31-8e7b-d76c4874be09 Victoria Online]</ref> \n\nThe [[Chief Justice of Victoria]] is ''ex officio'' the administrator, unless he or she is the lieutenant-governor, in which case, the next most senior judge is the administrator.

His influence on Western theatre, culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty plays, including major works such as ''[[Man and Superman]]'' (1902), ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (1912)'' and [[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\nBorn in Dublin, Shaw moved to London in 1876, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening, he joined the [[gradualism#Politics and society|gradualist]] [[Fabian Society]] and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success, ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' in 1894. Influenced by [[Henrik Ibsen]], he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political, social and religious ideas. By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included ''[[Major Barbara]]'', ''[[The Doctor's Dilemma (play)|The Doctor's Dilemma]]'' and ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]''.\n\nShaw's expressed views were often contentious; he promoted [[eugenics]] and alphabet reform, and opposed [[vaccination]] and organised religion. He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the [[First World War]] as equally culpable, and although not a [[Irish republicanism|republican]], castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period. These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist; the inter-war years saw a series of often ambitious plays, which achieved varying degrees of popular success. In 1938 he provided the screenplay for a filmed version of ''Pygmalion'' for which he received an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award]]. His appetite for politics and controversy remained undiminished; by the late 1920s he had largely renounced [[Fabian Society]] gradualism and often wrote and spoke favourably of dictatorships of the right and left\u2014he expressed admiration for both [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]. In the final decade of his life he made fewer public statements, but continued to write prolifically until shortly before his death, aged ninety-four, having refused all state honours, including the [[Order of Merit]] in 1946.\n\nSince Shaw's death scholarly and critical opinion has varied about his works, but he has regularly been rated as second only to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] among British dramatists; analysts recognise his extensive influence on generations of English-language playwrights. The word ''Shavian'' has entered the language as encapsulating Shaw's ideas and his means of expressing them.\n\n==Life==\n===Early years===\n[[File:Dublin Portobello 33 Synge Street George Bernard Shaw Birthplace 2.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Exterior of modest city house|Shaw's birthplace (2012 photograph).

His elder siblings were Lucinda (Lucy) Frances (1853\u20131920) and Elinor Agnes (1855\u20131876). The Shaw family was of [[Anglo-Irish people|English descent]] and belonged to the dominant [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland;{{refn|Shaw's biographer [[Michael Holroyd]] records that in 1689 Captain William Shaw fought for [[William III of England|William III]] at the [[Battle of the Boyne]], for which service he was granted a substantial estate in [[Kilkenny]].{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|p=2}}|group=n}} George Carr Shaw, an ineffectual alcoholic, was among the family's less successful members.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|p=2}} His relatives secured him a [[sinecure]] in the civil service, from which he was pensioned off in the early 1850s; thereafter he worked irregularly as a corn merchant.{{sfn|Ervine 1959 DNB archive}} In 1852 he married Bessie Gurly; in the view of Shaw's biographer [[Michael Holroyd]] she married to escape a tyrannical great-aunt.{{sfn|Shaw|1969|p=22}} If, as Holroyd and others surmise, George's motives were mercenary, then he was disappointed, as Bessie brought him little of her family's money.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=5\u20136}} She came to despise her ineffectual and often drunken husband, with whom she shared what their son later described as a life of \"shabby-genteel poverty\".{{sfn|Shaw|1969|p=22}}\n\nBy the time of Shaw's birth, his mother had become close to George John Lee, a flamboyant figure well known in Dublin's musical circles. Shaw retained a lifelong obsession that Lee might have been his biological father;{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}} there is no consensus among [[wikt:Shavian|Shavian]] scholars on the likelihood of this.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=13\u201314}}{{sfn|Rosset|1964|pp=105 and 129}}{{sfn|Dervin|1975|p=56}}{{sfn|O'Donovan|1965|p=108}} The young Shaw suffered no harshness from his mother, but he later recalled that her indifference and lack of affection hurt him deeply.{{sfn|Bosch|1984|pp=115\u2013117}} He found solace in the music that abounded in the house. Lee was a conductor and teacher of singing; Bessie had a fine [[mezzo-soprano]] voice and was much influenced by Lee's unorthodox method of vocal production. The Shaws' house was often filled with music, with frequent gatherings of singers and players.{{sfn|Ervine 1959 DNB archive}}\n\nIn 1862, Lee and the Shaws agreed to share a house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in an affluent part of Dublin, and a country cottage on [[Dalkey Hill]], overlooking [[Killiney Bay]].{{sfn|Holroyd|1990|pp=27\u201328}} Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly;{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=23\u201324}} thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with a wide spectrum of literature.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=24 (literature) and 25 (music)}}\n\nBetween 1865 and 1871, Shaw attended four schools, all of which he hated.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=19\u201321}}{{refn|The four schools were the [[Wesley College (Dublin)|Wesleyan Connexional School]], run by the [[Methodist Church in Ireland]]; a private school near [[Dalkey]]; Dublin Central Model Boys' School; and the Dublin English Scientific and Commercial Day School.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=19\u201321}}|group=n}} His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education: \"Schools and schoolmasters\", he later wrote, were \"prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents.\"{{sfn|Shaw|1949|pp=89\u201390}} In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents, where he worked hard, and quickly rose to become head cashier.{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}} During this period, Shaw was known as \"George Shaw\"; after 1876, he dropped the \"George\" and styled himself \"Bernard Shaw\".{{refn|Shaw's loathing of the name George began in his childhood.{{sfn|Nothorcot|1964|p=3}} He never succeeded in persuading his mother and sister to stop calling him by the name, but he made it known that everyone else who had any respect for his wishes should refrain from using it\u2014\"I hate being George-d\".{{sfn|Nothorcot|1964|pp=3\u20134 and 9}}|group=n}}\n\nIn June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London and never returned. A fortnight later, Bessie followed him; the two girls joined her.{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}}{{refn|By Shaw's account, Lee left Ireland because he had outgrown the musical possibilities of Dublin; in fact, Lee had overreached himself by trying to oust [[Robert Prescott Stewart|Sir Robert Stewart]] as the city's leading conductor. Stewart, professor of music at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], denounced him as a charlatan, and succeeded in driving him out.{{sfn|O'Donovan|1965|p=75}}|group=n}} Shaw's explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter's financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up.{{sfn|Westrup|1966|p=58}} Left in Dublin with his father, Shaw compensated for the absence of music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano.{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}}\n\n===London===\nEarly in 1876 Shaw learned from his mother that Agnes was dying of [[tuberculosis]]. He resigned from the land agents, and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agnes's funeral. He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.{{sfn|Ervine 1959 DNB archive}}\n\n[[File:Bernard-Shaw-1879.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=young man with faint, wispy beard|Shaw in 1879]]\nInitially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in [[South Kensington]], but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had no thought yet of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, [[ghostwriter|ghost-writing]] a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, ''The Hornet''.{{sfn|Ervine 1959 DNB archive}} Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London.{{refn|Shaw attributed the breach to Bessie's disillusion when Lee abandoned his distinctive teaching methods to pursue a cynically commercial exploitation of gullible pupils; others, including Holroyd, have suggested that Bessie was resentful that Lee's affections were turning elsewhere, not least to her daughter Lucy.{{sfn|Westrup|1966|p=58}}{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=40\u201341}}|group=n}} Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=40\u201341}}{{refn|Shaw had a passable [[baritone]] voice,{{sfn|Pharand|2000|p=24}} though he admitted that he was far outclassed as a singer by his sister Lucy, who had a career as a [[soprano]] with the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company|Carl Rosa]] and [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte]] opera companies.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=25 and 68}}{{sfn|Rollins and Witts 1962|pp=54\u201355 and 58}}|group=n}}\n\nEventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the [[British Museum]] Reading Room (the forerunner of the [[British Library]]) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing.{{sfn|Laurence|1976|p=8}} His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a [[blank verse|blank-verse]] satirical piece on a religious theme. It was abandoned unfinished, as was his first try at a novel. His first completed novel, ''Immaturity'' (1879), was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s.{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}} He was employed briefly by the newly formed Edison Telephone Company in 1879\u201380, and as in Dublin achieved rapid promotion. Nonetheless, when the [[National Telephone Company|Edison firm merged]] with the rival Bell Telephone Company, Shaw chose not to seek a place in the new organisation.{{sfn|Peters|1996|pp=56\u201357}} Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|p=48}}\n\nFor the next four years Shaw made a negligible income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=48\u201349}} In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]].{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}} He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by [[smallpox]].{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=55\u201356}}{{refn|Vegetarianism and the luxuriant beard were among the things with which Shaw became associated by the general public.

Stone of Chicago.{{sfn|''Love Among the Artists'': WorldCat}}|group=n}}\n\nIn 1880 Shaw began attending meetings of the Zetetical Society, whose objective was to \"search for truth in all matters affecting the interests of the human race\".{{sfn|Bevir|2011|p=155}} Here he met [[Sidney Webb]], a junior civil servant who, like Shaw, was busy educating himself. Despite difference of style and temperament, the two quickly recognised qualities in each other and developed a lifelong friendship.

He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, [[Henry Hyndman|H. M. Hyndman]], whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities.

In this, he denounced the pacifist line espoused by Ramsay MacDonald and other socialist leaders, and proclaimed his readiness to shoot all pacifists rather than cede them power and influence.{{sfn|Griffith|1993|p=228}} On the advice of Beatrice Webb, this pamphlet remained unpublished.{{sfn|Holroyd|1989|p=361}}\n\n''The Intelligent Woman's Guide'', Shaw's main political treatise of the 1920s, attracted both admiration and criticism.

[[rusting]]. The most common method is [[hot-dip galvanization|hot-dip galvanizing]], in which the parts are submerged in a bath of molten zinc.\n\n==Protective action==\nGalvanizing protects the underlying iron or steel in the following main ways:\n* The zinc coating, when intact, prevents corrosive substances from reaching the underlying steel or iron.\n* The zinc protects iron by corroding first. For better results, application of [[chromate]]s over zinc is also seen as an industrial trend.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n* In the event the underlying metal becomes exposed, protection can continue as long as there is zinc close enough to be electrically coupled. After all of the zinc in the immediate area is consumed, localized corrosion of the base metal can occur.\n\n==History and etymology==\n[[File:NailsCloseup.jpg|thumb|Galvanized nails]]\nNamed via [[French language|French]] from the name of [[Italian people|Italian]] scientist [[Luigi Galvani]], the earliest use of the term was, in early 19th-century scientific research and medical practice, stimulation of a muscle by the application of an electric current. The term \"galvanized\" continues to be used metaphorically of any stimulus which results in activity by a person or group of people.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|edition=2|volume=VI|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=340|editor=James A. H. Murray ''et al''|isbn=0 19 861218-4}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest known example of galvanized iron was encountered by Europeans on 17th-century Indian armour in the [[Royal Armouries]] Museum collection.<ref>[http://www.royalarmouries.org/what-we-do/research/analytical-projects/zinc-coatings-of-indian-plate-and-mail-armour] Summary of XRF analysis conducted on or about 30 September 1999 by the Royal Armouries Museum in [[Leeds]] and written up as part of a thesis by Helen Bowstead Stallybrass at the Department of Archaeological Sciences, [[Bradford University]].</ref> The armoured application is the origin of the metaphorical use of the verb \"galvanize\", meaning to reinforce.\n \nIn modern usage, the term \"galvanizing\" has largely come to be associated with zinc coatings, to the exclusion of other metals. Galvanic paint, a precursor to [[hot-dip galvanizing]], was patented by [[Stanislas Sorel]], of [[Paris]], in December 1837.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=W8oGAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA52&dq=%22Specification+of+a+Patent+for+a+process+for+protecting+articles+made+of+Iron+or+Steel+from+oxidation.%22&lr=&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES Process for protecting articles made of Iron or Steel from oxidation.\"] Specification of patent granted to M. Sorel, of Paris, France, December, 1837.

In the case of [[automobile]] bodies, where additional decorative coatings of paint will be applied, a thinner form of galvanizing is applied by [[electrogalvanization|electrogalvanizing]]. The hot-dip process generally does not reduce strength on a measurable scale,<ref>Industrial Galvanizes: http://www.ingal.com.au/IGSM/28.htm</ref> with the exception of high-strength steels (>1100 MPa) where [[hydrogen embrittlement]] can become a problem.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beyondrigging.com/2014/02/hydrogen-embrittlement/ | title = Zinc Plating and Hydrogen Embrittlement}}''Hydrogen Embrittlement Handbook''</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galvanizeit.org/designing-fabricating/design-considerations/steel-selection/ |publisher=American Galvanizers Association |title=Steel Selection |access-date=3 April 2015}}</ref> This deficiency is a consideration affecting the manufacture of [[wire rope]] and other highly-stressed products. \n\nThe protection provided by hot-dip galvanizing is insufficient for products that will be constantly exposed to corrosive materials such as [[acid]]s, including [[acid rain]] in outdoor uses. For these applications, more expensive [[stainless steel]] is preferred. Some [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] made today are galvanized. Nonetheless, electroplating is used on its own for many outdoor applications because it is cheaper than hot-dip zinc coating and looks good when new. Another reason not to use hot-dip zinc coating is that for [[Screw|bolt]]s and [[Nut (hardware)|nut]]s of size M10 (US 3/8\") or smaller, the thick hot-dipped coating fills in too much of the threads, which reduces strength (because the dimension of the steel prior to coating must be reduced for the fasteners to fit together). This means that for [[car]]s, [[bicycle]]s, and many other light mechanical products, the practical alternative to electroplating bolts and nuts is not hot-dip zinc coating, but making the fasteners from stainless steel or (stronger but much more expensive) [[titanium]].\n\n[[File:Feuerverzinktes Gel\u00e4nder.jpg|thumb|right|Galvanized surface with visible spangle]]\nThe size of [[crystallite]]s (grains) in galvanized coatings is a visible and aesthetic feature, known as \"spangle\". By varying the number of particles added for heterogeneous [[nucleation]] and the rate of cooling in a hot-dip process, the spangle can be adjusted from an apparently uniform surface (crystallites too small to see with the naked eye) to grains several centimetres wide. Visible crystallites are rare in other engineering materials, even though they are usually present.\n\nThermal diffusion galvanizing, or [[Sherardizing]], provides a zinc diffusion coating on iron- or copper-based materials.<ref name=\"Zinchand\">{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Frank C. |date=1991 |title=Zinc Handbook |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-8340-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=laACw9i0D_wC&q=sherardizing&cad=6#v=snippet&q=sherardizing&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"MittemeijerSomers2014\">{{cite book |last1=Natrup |first1=F. |last2=Graf |first2=W. |editor1-last=Mittemeijer |editor1-first=Eric J. |editor2-last=Somers |editor2-first=Marcel A.

Around {{convert|300|\u00b0C}}, zinc will  diffuse into the substrate to form a zinc alloy. The advance surface preparation of the goods can be carried out by [[shot blasting]]. The process is also known as \"dry galvanizing\", because no liquids are involved; this can avoid possible problems caused by hydrogen embrittlement. The dull-grey crystal structure of the zinc diffusion coating has a good adhesion to paint, powder coatings, or rubber. It is a preferred method for coating small, complex-shaped metals, and for smoothing rough surfaces on items formed with [[sintered]] metal.\n\n==Eventual corrosion==\n[[File:Rust 1.jpeg|thumb|right|Rusted corrugated steel roof]]\nAlthough galvanizing will inhibit attack of the underlying steel, rusting will be inevitable after some decades of exposure to weather, especially if exposed to acidic conditions. For example, [[corrugated iron]] sheet roofing will start to degrade within a few years despite the protective action of the zinc coating. Marine and salty environments also lower the lifetime of galvanized iron because the high [[electrical conductivity]] of [[sea water]] increases the rate of [[corrosion]], primarily through converting the solid zinc to soluble [[zinc chloride]] which simply washes away. Galvanized [[car frame]]s exemplify this; they corrode much faster in cold environments due to [[road salt]], though they will last longer than unprotected steel. \n\nGalvanized steel can last for many decades if other supplementary measures are maintained, such as [[paint]] coatings and additional [[sacrificial anode]]s. The rate of corrosion in non-salty environments is caused mainly by levels of [[sulfur dioxide]] in the air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galvanizing.org.uk/about_galvanizing/corrosion_performance/atmospheric_resistance |title=Atmospheric Resistance |publisher=Galvanising Association (UK) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222165139/http://www.galvanizing.org.uk/about_galvanizing/corrosion_performance/atmospheric_resistance |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}</ref> In the most benign natural environments, such as inland low population areas, galvanized steel can last without rust for over 100 years.{{cn|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Galvanized construction steel==\nThis is the most common use for galvanized metal, and hundreds of thousands of tons of steel products are galvanized annually worldwide. In developed countries most larger cities have several galvanizing factories, and many items of steel manufacture are galvanized for protection. Typically these include: street furniture, building frameworks, balconies, verandahs, staircases, ladders, walkways, and more. Hot dip galvanized steel is also used for making steel frames as a basic construction material for steel frame buildings.\n\n==Galvanized piping==\n{{see also|Galvanic corrosion}}\nIn the early 20th century, galvanized piping replaced previously-used [[cast iron]] and [[lead]] in cold-water plumbing. Typically, galvanized piping rusts from the inside out, building up layers of plaque on the inside of the piping, causing both water pressure problems and eventual pipe failure. These plaques can flake off, leading to visible impurities in water and a slight metallic taste. The life expectancy of galvanized piping is about 70 years,{{cn|date=February 2017}} but it may vary by region due to impurities in the water supply and the proximity of electrical grids for which interior piping acts as a pathway (the flow of electricity can accelerate chemical corrosion). Pipe longevity also depends on the thickness of zinc in the original galvanizing, which ranges on a scale from G40 to G210,{{clarify|date=February 2017}} and whether the pipe was galvanized on both the inside and outside, or just the outside. \n\nSince World War II, [[copper tubing|copper]] and [[plastic pipe|plastic]] piping have replaced galvanized piping for interior drinking water service, but galvanized steel pipes are still used in outdoor applications requiring steel's superior mechanical strength.\nThe use of galvanized pipes lends some truth to the urban myth that water purity in outdoor water faucets is lower, but the actual impurities (iron, zinc, calcium) are harmless.{{cn|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe presence of galvanized piping detracts from the appraised value of housing stock because piping can fail, increasing the risk of water damage. Galvanized piping will eventually need to be replaced if housing stock is to outlast a 50 to 70 year life expectancy, and some jurisdictions{{which|date=March 2013}} require galvanized piping to be replaced before sale. One option to extend the life expectancy of existing galvanized piping is to line it with an [[epoxy resin]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Cathodic protection]]\n* [[Corrugated galvanized iron]]\n* [[Galvanic corrosion]]\n* [[Galvannealed]] - galvanization and annealing\n* [[Prepainted metal]]\n* [[Rust]]\n* [[Rustproofing]]\n* [[Sendzimir process]]\n* [[Sherardizing]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|galvanize}}\n{{Commons category|Galvanization}}\n* [http://www.galvanizeit.org/ American Galvanizers Association]\n* [http://www.galvanizing.org.uk/ Galvanizers Association]\n* [http://www.galvanizing.ie/ Galvanizers Association Ireland]\n\n[[Category:Chemical processes]]\n[[Category:Corrosion prevention]]\n[[Category:Metal plating]]\n[[Category:Zinc]]", "sha1": "7yiwqwyqwzj6i50bcwguvihvgs5n616"}}, {"title": "Golden Rule", "ns": "0", "id": "12859", "revision": {"id": "864660608", "parentid": "864196336", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T17:07:07Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ohnoitsjamie", "id": "507787"}, "comment": "fix", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Distinguish|Golden Law|Golden ratio|Golden Act}}\n{{Other uses|Golden Rule (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\nThe '''Golden Rule''' is the principle of treating others as one's self would wish to be treated.

G. Singer, The Ideal of a Rational Morality, p. 270</ref> Counter-examples to the golden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second.\n\nIn his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation that such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain general ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste, in situation, and so forth). But if we apply the golden rule to our own method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to apply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since it is quite predictable that others' ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It follows that we should not do so ourselves\u2014according to the golden rule. In this way, the golden rule may be self-correcting.<ref>Wattles, p. 6</ref> An article by Jouni Reinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail.<ref>Jouni Reinikainen, \"The Golden Rule and the Requirement of Universalizability.\" Journal of Value Inquiry. 39(2): 155\u2013168, 2005.</ref>\n\nIt is possible, then, that the golden rule can itself guide us in identifying which differences of situation are morally relevant. We would often want other people to ignore any prejudice against our [[Race (human categorization)|race]] or nationality when deciding how to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing preferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on.

[[Dublin City University]] has its main campus and other facilities in the area.\n\nGlasnevin is also a [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] in the ancient [[Barony (Ireland)|barony]] of [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]].<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/846.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - Glasnevin civil parish</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nA mainly residential neighbourhood, Glasnevin is located on the [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] of the city of [[Dublin]] (about 3&nbsp;km north of Dublin City centre). It was established on the northern bank of the [[River Tolka]], and now extends north and south of it.  At least two streams flow into the Tolka in the area, and can be seen near the Catholic church. One comes from the vicinity of Glasnevin Cemetery and one from the north.  In addition, a major diversion from the Wad River comes from the Ballymun area.\n\nGlasnevin is bordered to the north by [[Finglas]], northeast by [[Ballymun]] and [[Santry]], [[Whitehall, Dublin|Whitehall]] to the east, [[Phibsboro]] and [[Drumcondra, Dublin|Drumcondra]] to the south and [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]] to the west.\n\nGlasnevin is part of the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] constituency of [[Dublin Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin Central]] and [[Dublin North-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North-West]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\nGlasnevin seems to have been founded by [[Mobh\u00ed Cl\u00e1rainech|Saint Mobhi]] (sometimes known as St Berchan) in the sixth (or perhaps fifth) century as a monastery. His monastery continued to be used for many years afterwards - St. Colman is recorded as having paid homage to its founder when he returned from abroad to visit [[Ireland]] a century after St Mobhi's death in 544. [[St. Columba]] of [[Iona]] is thought to have studied under St. Mobhi, but left Glasnevin following an outbreak of plague and journeyed north to open the House at Derry; there is a long street (Iona Road) in Glasnevin named in his honour and the church on Iona Road is called Saint Columba's.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nA settlement grew up around the monastery, which survived until the Viking invasions in the eighth century. After raids on monasteries at [[Glendalough]] and [[Clondalkin]], the monasteries at Glasnevin and [[Finglas]] were attacked and destroyed.\n\nBy 822 Glasnevin, along with [[Grangegorman]] and Clonken or Clonkene (now known as [[Deansgrange]]),<ref>Mac Giolla Phadraig, Brian, '14th century life in a Dublin Monastery' in ''Dublin Historical Record'' 1(3) (September, 1938), pp 69, 72.</ref> had become parts of the grange (farm) of [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] and it seems to have maintained this connection up to the time of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nThe [[Battle of Clontarf]] was fought on the banks of the [[River Tolka]] in 1014 (a  field called the ''bloody acre'' is supposed to be part of the site). The Irish defeated the Danes in a battle, in which 7,000 Danes and 4,000 Irish died.\n\nThe 12th century saw the [[Normans]] (who had conquered England and [[Wales]] in the eleventh century) invade Ireland. As local rulers continued fighting amongst themselves the Norman King of England [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] was invited to intervene. He arrived in 1171, took control of much land, and then parcelled it out amongst his supporters. Glasnevin ended up under the jurisdiction of Finglas Abbey. Later, [[Laurence O'Toole]], Archbishop of Dublin, took responsibility for Glasnevin and it became the property of the Priory of the Most Holy Trinity (Christ Church Cathedral).\n\nIn 1240 a church and tower was reconstructed on the site of the Church of St. Mobhi in the monastery. The returns of the church for 1326 stated that 28 tenants resided in Glasnevin. The church was enlarged in 1346, along with a small hall known as the Manor Hall.\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\nWhen [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] broke from Rome an era of religious repression began. During the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], [[Catholic Church]] property and land was appropriated to the new [[Church of England]], and monasteries (including the one at Glasnevin) were forcibly closed and fell into ruin. Glasnevin had at this stage developed as a village, with its principal landmark and focal point being its \"bull-ring\" noted in 1542.\n\nBy 1667 Glasnevin had expanded - but not by very much; it is recorded as containing 24 houses. The development of the village was given a fresh impetus when [[Sir John Rogerson]] built his country residence - \"The Glen\" or \"Glasnevin House\" - outside the village.\n\nThe [[plantations of Ireland]] saw the settlement of [[Protestant]] English families on land previously held by Catholics. Lands at Glasnevin were leased to such families and a Protestant church was erected there in 1707. It was built on the site of the old Catholic Church and was named after St. Mobhi. The church was largely rebuilt in the mid-18th century. The attached churchyard became a graveyard for both Protestants and Catholics.  It is said that [[Robert Emmet]] is buried there, this claim being made because once somebody working in the graveyard there dug up a headless body.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Early modern times===\nBy now Glasnevin was an area for families of distinction - in spite of a comment attributed to the Protestant Archbishop King of Dublin that \"when any couple had a mind to be wicked, they would retire to Glasnevin\". In a letter, dated 1725 he described Glasnevin as \"the receptacle for thieves and rogues. The first search when anything was stolen, was there, and when any couple had a mind to retire to be wicked there was their harbour. But since the church was built, and service regularly settled, all these evils are banished. Good houses are built in it, and the place civilised.\"<ref>[[Richard Mant]], ''History of the Church of Ireland''.</ref> [[Glasnevin National School]] was also built during this period.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\nIn the 1830's, the civil parish population was recorded as 1,001, of whom 559 resided in the village. Glasnevin was described as a parish in the barony of [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]], pleasantly situated and the residence of many families of distinction.<ref>Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, Lewis (1837)</ref>\n\nOn 1 June 1832, Charles Lindsay, [[Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin]] and the William John released their holdings of Sir John Rogerson's lands at Glasnevin, (including Glasnevin House) to George Hayward Lindsay. This transfer included the sum of 1,500 Pounds Sterling. Although this does not specifically cite the marriage of George Hayward Lindsay to Lady Mary Catherine Gore, George Lindsay almost certainly came into the lands at Glasnevin as a result of his marriage.\n\nWhen Drumcondra began to rapidly expand in the 1870s, the residents of Glasnevin sought to protect their district and opposed being merged with the neighbouring suburb. One of the objectors was the property-owner, Dr Gogarty, the father of the Irish poet, [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]].\n\nGlasnevin became a township in 1878 and became part of the City of Dublin in 1900 under the Dublin Boundaries Act, which received the Royal Assent on August 6, 1900.\n\nGeorge Hayward Lindsay's eldest son, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Gore Lindsay, was in possession of his father's lands at Glasnevin when the area began to be developed at the beginning of the twentieth-century. The development of his lands after 1903/04 marked the start of the gradual development of the area.\n\nGlasnevin remained relatively undeveloped until the opening up of the Carroll Estate in 1914, which saw the creation of the redbrick residential roads running down towards Drumcondra. The process was accelerated by Dublin Corporation in the 1920s and the present shape of the suburb was firmly in place by 1930. Nevertheless, until comparatively recent years, a short stroll up the Old Finglas Road brought you rapidly into open countryside.\n\nThe start of the 20th century also saw the opening of a short lived railway station on the Drumcondra and North Dublin Link Railway line from [[Glasnevin Junction]] to [[Connolly Station]] (then Amiens Street). It opened in 1906 and closed at the end of 1907.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Glasnevin railway station opened on 1 April 1901 and closed on 1 December 1910.<ref>{{cite web | title=Glasnevin station | work=Railscot - Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref>\n\n==Village of Glasnevin==\nThe village has changed a lot over the years, and is now part of Dublin city. It is now populated by a mix of young families, senior citizens and students attending Dublin City University.\n\nAs well as the amenities of the [[National Botanic Gardens (Ireland)]] and local parks, the national meteorological office [[Met \u00c9ireann]], the [http://www.cfb.ie/Central Fisheries Board], the [[National Standards Authority of Ireland]], [http://www.sei.ie/ Sustainable Energy Ireland], the [http://www.nml-ireland.ie/ National Metrology Laboratory] (NML), the [[Department of Defence (Ireland)|Department of Defence]] and the national enterprise and trade board [[Enterprise Ireland]] are all located in the area.\n\n===National Botanic Gardens===\n{{Main|Irish National Botanic Gardens}}\n[[Image:INBG Glasnevin 02.jpg|thumb|The Curvilinear Range of glasshouses at the [[Irish National Botanic Gardens]]]]\nThe house and lands of the poet [[Thomas Tickell]] were sold in 1790 to the Irish Parliament and given to the [[Royal Dublin Society]] for them to establish Ireland's first [[Irish National Botanic Gardens|Botanic Gardens]]. The gardens were the first location in Ireland where the infection responsible for the 1845\u20131847 potato famine was identified. Throughout the famine research to stop the infection was undertaken at the gardens.\n\nThe {{convert|48|acre|m2}} which border the [[River Tolka]] also adjoin the [[Prospect Cemetery]]. In 2002 the Botanic Gardens gained a new two-storey complex which included a new cafe and a large lecture theatre. The Irish National [[Herbarium]] is also located at the botanic gardens.\n\n===Glasnevin (Prospect) Cemetery===\n[[Image:Crossglasnevin.jpg|thumb|Crosses at [[Glasnevin Cemetery]]]]\nProspect Cemetery is located in Glasnevin, although better known as [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], the most historically notable burial place in the country and the last resting place, among a host of historical figures, of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and also [[Arthur Griffith]].  This graveyard led to Glasnevin being known as \"the dead centre of Dublin\". It opened in 1832 and is the final resting place for thousands of ordinary citizens, as well as many Irish patriots.\n\n===Hart's Corner===\nApproaching Glasnevin via [[Phibsboro]] is what is known as ''[[Dublin street corners|Hart's Corner]]'' but which about 200 years ago was called [[Broadstone, Dublin|Glasmanogue]], and was then a well-known stage on the way to Finglas. At an earlier date the name possessed a wider signification and was applied to a considerable portion of the adjoining district.\n\n===Delville===\nAt the start of the 18th century a large house, called [[Delville House|Delville]] - known at first as The Glen - was built on the site of the present [[Bon Secours Hospital, Dublin]]. Its name was an amalgamation of the surnames of two tenants, Dr. Helsam and Dr. Patrick Delany (as Heldeville), both Fellows of Trinity College.\n\nWhen Delany married his first wife he acquired sole ownership, but it became famous as the home of Delany and his second wife - Mary Pendarves. She was a widow whom Delany married in 1743, and was an accomplished letter writer.\n\nThey couple were friends of [[Jonathan Swift|Dean Jonathan Swift]] and, through him, of [[Alexander Pope]]. Pope encouraged the Delaneys to develop a garden in a style then becoming popular in England - moving away from the very formal, geometric layout that was common. He redesigned the house in the style of a villa and had the gardens laid out in the latest Dutch fashion creating what was almost certainly Ireland's first naturalistic garden.\n\nThe house was, under Mrs Delany, a centre of Dublin's intellectual life. Swift is said to have composed many of his campaigning pamphlets while staying there. He and his life - long companion Stella were both in the habit of visiting, and Swift satirised the grounds which he considered too small for the size of the house. Through her correspondence with her sister, Mrs Dewes, Mary wrote of Swift in 1733: \"he calls himself my master and corrects me when I speak bad English or do not pronounce my words distinctly\".\n\nPatrick Delany died in 1768 at the age of 82, prompting his widow to sell Delville and return to her native England until her death twenty years later.\n\n===The Pyramid Church===\nGlasnevin is also a [[parish]] in the [[List of parishes of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin by deanery#Parishes of Fingal South West deanery|Fingal South West deanery]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin]].<ref>[http://www.glasnevinparish.ie/ Official website] - Glasnevin parish</ref> It is served by the Church of Lady of Dolours. The church underwent some refurbishment work inside and in its grounds and car park during the first half of 2011. A timber church, which originally stood on Berkeley Road, was moved to a riverside site on Botanic Avenue early in the twentieth century. The altar in this church was from Newgate prison in Dublin. It served as the parish church until it was replaced, in 1972, by a structure resembling a pyramid when viewed from Botanic Avenue. The previous church was known locally as \"The Woodener\" or \"The Wooden\" and the new building is still known to older residents as \"The new Woodener\" or \"The Wigwam\".\n\n===Met \u00c9ireann===\n[[Image:Met ireann (Irish Meteorological Service) (1387399963).jpg|thumb|[[Met \u00c9ireann]] headquarters]]\nIn 1975 the new headquarters of [[Met \u00c9ireann]], the Irish Meteorological Office, opened just off Glasnevin Hill, on the former site of Marlborough House. The Met \u00c9ireann building too was built in a somewhat pyramidal shape and is recognised as one of the most significant, smaller commercial buildings, to be erected in Dublin in the 1970s.\n\n===Griffith Avenue===\nGriffith Avenue, which runs through Glasnevin, [[Drumcondra, Dublin|Drumcondra]] and [[Marino, Dublin|Marino]]. The avenue spans three electoral constituencies. It was named after [[Arthur Griffith]] who was the founder and third leader of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and also served as [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].

They celebrated their 125th anniversary in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} [[Basketball]] is organised by Tolka Rovers. Tennis is played in [[Charleville Lawn Tennis Club]], founded in 1894 by a small group of tennis enthusiasts headed by a Mrs McConnell. Charleville took its name from the original location at the corner of the Charleville and Cabra Roads. The move to its present location on Whitworth Road took place in 1904. The club boasts a membership of 400 senior and junior members and the club has won many Dublin Lawn Tennis Council titles, above the average for a club of their size. Hockey is also played in Botanic Hockey club on the Old Finglas Road. Glasnevin Boxing Club and Football(soccer) club has a clubhouse on Mobhi road.\n\nScouting has a strong tradition in Glasnevin with 1st Dublin (L.H.O) Scout Troop located on the corner of Griffith Avenue and Ballygall Road East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1stdublin.com|title=Coming Soon - Future home of something quite cool|work=1stdublin.com}}</ref> The Scout group celebrated 100 years of Scouting in 2011 making it one of the longest established Scout Groups in the world.\n\nThere are several primary schools in Glasnevin, including [[Lindsay Road National School]], [[Glasnevin National School]], Glasnevin [[Educate Together]] [[National School (Ireland)|National school]], North Dublin National School Project, Scoil Mobhi, St.Brigids GNS, St.Columbas NS and St.Vincents CBS.\n\nThere are several Roman Catholic secondary schools in the area  [[St. Vincent's C.B.S.|St Vincent's (Christian Brothers) School]], Scoil Chaitr\u00edona and St Mary's Secondary School.\n\n[[Billy Whelan]], one of the eight [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] players who lost their lives in the [[Munich air disaster]] of 6 February 1958, was born locally on 1 April 1935.

He received degrees in Philosophy and Political Science, and Terrorism Studies respectively.\nHe served as assistant to the Irish Labour Party's spokesperson on economic affairs, Joan Burton TD, before moving to Kilkenny City, County Kilkenny to work in his uncle's constituency office. His uncle, S\u00e9amus Pattison TD is a former Ceann Comhairle of the D\u00e1il, and has announced his intention to step down at the next election.\nEoin Pattison sought a nomination from the Labour Party to run at the next general election, but was surprisingly defeated for the party nomination in February 2006 by a local county councillor, Michael O'Brien. Newspapers reported that local party members had privately admitted to being unhappy at the prospect of the seat passing to \"a third generation\" of the Pattison family (James Pattison, the father of S\u00e9amus Pattison and grandfather of Eoin Pattison, had been a Labour TD for Kilkenny for many years between 1933 and 1957).-->\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of towns and villages in the Republic of Ireland|List of towns and villages in Ireland]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Weston St. John Joyce, \"''The Neighbourhood of Dublin''\" (third and enlarged edition 1920).

He examined the [[RR Lyrae variable]]s in the clusters (which he assumed were [[Cepheid variable]]s) and used their period\u2013luminosity relationship for distance estimates.

In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of globular clusters around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Shapley | first = Harlow | date= 1918\n | title = Globular clusters and the structure of the galactic system\n | journal = Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific\n | volume = 30 | issue = 173 | pages = 42\u201354\n | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1918PASP...30...42S\n | bibcode = 1918PASP...30...42S | doi = 10.1086/122686\n | author-link = Harlow Shapley }}</ref> While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same [[order of magnitude]] as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.\n\nShapley's measurements also indicated that the Sun is relatively far from the center of the galaxy, also contrary to what had previously been inferred from the apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy's disk and those stars that lie in the direction of the galactic centre and beyond are thus obscured by gas and dust, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further distances.\n\n===Classification ===\n{{Main|Shapley\u2013Sawyer Concentration Class}}\nShapley was subsequently assisted in his studies of clusters by [[Henrietta Hill Swope|Henrietta Swope]] and [[Helen Sawyer Hogg|Helen Battles Sawyer]] (later Hogg).

The mass of these intermediate mass black holes is proportional to the mass of the clusters, following a pattern previously discovered between supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies.\n\nClaims of intermediate mass black holes have been met with some skepticism.

The\ncolor index, B\u2212V, is the difference between the magnitude of the star in blue light, or B, and the magnitude in visual light (green-yellow), or V. Large positive values indicate a red star with a cool surface [[temperature]], while negative values imply a blue star with a hotter surface.\n\nWhen the stars near the [[Sun]] are plotted on an HR diagram, it displays a distribution of stars of various masses, ages, and compositions. Many of the stars lie relatively close to a sloping curve with increasing absolute magnitude as the stars are hotter, known as [[main sequence|main-sequence]] stars. However the diagram also typically includes stars that are in later stages of their evolution and have wandered away from this main-sequence curve.\n\nAs all the stars of a globular cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their [[visual magnitude]] by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that is believed to be comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as [[RR Lyrae]] stars and [[cepheid variable]]s, with those in the cluster.<ref>{{cite journal\n | author=Shapley, H. | authorlink=Harlow Shapley\n | date=1917 | title=Studies based on the colors and magnitudes in stellar clusters.

The shape of the curve for a globular cluster is characteristic of a grouping of stars that were formed at approximately the same time and from the same materials, differing only in their initial mass. As the position of each star in the HR diagram varies with age, the shape of the curve for a globular cluster can be used to measure the overall age of the star population.<ref>{{cite journal\n | author=Sandage, A.R. | authorlink=Allan Sandage\n | title=Observational Approach to Evolution.

Certain clusters even display populations that are absent from other globular clusters (e.g., blue hook stars), or feature multiple populations.  The historical paradigm that all globular clusters consist of stars born at exactly the same time, or sharing exactly the same chemical abundance, has likewise been overturned (e.g., NGC 2808).<ref name=kr2010>Kalirai & Richer (2010).

One such effect is called blending, and it arises because the cores of globular clusters are so dense that in low-resolution observations multiple (unresolved) stars may appear as a single target. Thus the brightness measured for that seemingly single star (e.g., an RR Lyrae variable) is erroneously too bright, given those unresolved stars contributed to the brightness determined.<ref name=ma2012>Majaess et al.

As the cluster ages, stars of successively lower masses will also enter the [[giant star]] stage. Thus the age of a single population cluster can be measured by looking for the stars that are just beginning to enter the giant star stage. This forms a \"knee\" in the HR diagram, bending to the upper right from the main-sequence line. The absolute magnitude at this bend is directly a function of the age of globular cluster, so an age scale can be plotted on an axis parallel to the magnitude.\n\nIn addition, globular clusters can be dated by looking at the temperatures of the coolest white dwarfs.

However, a possible exception is when strong tidal interactions with other large masses result in the dispersal of the stars.\n\nAfter they are formed, the stars in the globular cluster begin to interact gravitationally with each other. As a result, the velocity vectors of the stars are steadily modified, and the stars lose any history of their original velocity. The characteristic interval for this to occur is the [[relaxation time]].

During a globular cluster's adolescence, the process of core-collapse begins with stars near the core.

As other stars interact with these tight binaries, they increase the energy at the core, which causes the cluster to re-expand.

Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.<ref name=\"murphy\" />\n\nThe ultimate fate of a globular cluster must be either to accrete stars at its core, causing its steady contraction,<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Zhou, Yuan |author2=Zhong, Xie Guang | title=The core evolution of a globular cluster containing massive black holes\n | journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |date=June 1990 | volume=168 | issue=2 | pages=233\u2013241\n | bibcode=1990Ap&SS.168..233Y\n | doi=10.1007/BF00636869 }}</ref> or gradual shedding of stars from its outer layers.<ref>{{cite web\n | last=Pooley | first=Dave | url=http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~pooley/research/node1.html\n | title=Globular Cluster Dynamics: the importance of close binaries in a real N-body system\n | publisher=UW-Madison | accessdate=2008-12-11 }}</ref>\n\n===Intermediate forms===\n[[File:Globular Cluster M10.jpg|thumb|[[Messier 10]] lies about 15,000 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of [[Ophiuchus (constellation)|Ophiuchus]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Globular Cluster M10|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1225a/|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Picture of the Week}}</ref> ]]\n\nThe distinction between cluster types is not always\nclear-cut, and objects have been found that blur the\nlines between the categories.

What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger \u2013 several hundred light-years across \u2013 and hundreds of times less dense.

The difference in the pull of gravity between the part of the cluster nearest the mass and the pull on the furthest part of the cluster results in a [[tidal force]]. A \"tidal shock\" occurs whenever the orbit of a cluster takes it through the plane of a galaxy.\n\nAs a result of a tidal shock, streams of stars can be pulled away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster.

Most of this work was in small craft propelled by both sail and oar; manoeuvring larger sail-powered vessels in uncharted waters was generally impractical and dangerous.\n\nVancouver named many features for his officers, friends, associates, and his ship ''Discovery'', including:\n* [[Mount Baker]] \u2013 after ''Discovery's'' 3rd Lieutenant [[Joseph Baker (captain)|Joseph Baker]], the first on the expedition to spot it\n* [[Mount St. Helens]] \u2013  after his friend, [[Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens]]\n* [[Puget Sound]] \u2013 after ''Discovery's'' 2nd lieutenant [[Peter Puget]],<ref name=wing>{{cite book\n|author1=Wing, Robert  |author2=Newell, Gordon\n|title=Peter Puget: Lieutenant on the Vancouver Expedition, fighting British naval officer, the man for whom Puget Sound was named \n|publisher=Gray Beard Publishing\n|year=1979|isbn=0-933686-00-5}}</ref> who explored its southern reaches.\n* [[Mount Rainier]] \u2013  after his friend, Rear Admiral [[Peter Rainier, junior|Peter Rainier]].\n* [[Port Gardner]] and [[Port Susan]], Washington \u2013  after his former commander Vice Admiral [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Sir Alan Gardner]] and his wife Lady Susan.\n* [[Whidbey Island]] \u2013 after naval engineer [[Joseph Whidbey]].\n* [[Discovery Passage]], [[Discovery Island (British Columbia)|Discovery Island]], [[Discovery Bay, Washington|Discovery Bay]] and [[Port Discovery, Washington|Port Discovery]].\n\nVancouver was the second European to enter [[Burrard Inlet]] on 13 June 1792, naming it for his friend [[Sir Harry Burrard-Neale, 2nd Baronet|Sir Harry Burrard]].

Here he unexpectedly met a Spanish expedition led by [[Dionisio Alcal\u00e1 Galiano]] and [[Cayetano Vald\u00e9s y Flores]]. Vancouver was ''\"mortified\"'' (''his word'') to learn they already had a crude chart of the [[Georgia Strait|Strait of Georgia]] based on the 1791 exploratory voyage of [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Narv\u00e1ez]] the year before, under command of [[Francisco de Eliza]]. For three weeks they cooperatively explored the Georgia Strait and the [[Discovery Islands]] area before sailing separately towards [[Nootka Sound]].\n\nAfter the summer surveying season ended, in August 1792, Vancouver went to [[Nootka Sound|Nootka]], then the region's most important harbour, on contemporary Vancouver Island. Here he was to receive any British buildings and lands returned by the Spanish from claims by Francisco de Eliza for the [[Spanish crown]]. The Spanish commander, [[Juan Francisco Bodega y Quadra]], was very cordial and he and Vancouver exchanged the maps they had made, but no agreement was reached; they decided to await further instructions. At this time, they decided to name the large island on which Nootka was now proven to be located as ''Quadra and Vancouver Island''. Years later, as Spanish influence declined, the name was shortened to simply [[Vancouver Island]].<ref>''The Voyage of George Vancouver 1791\u20131795, Volume 1''. W. Kaye Lamb (ed.).

Gray had entered the river during the summer before sailing to Nootka Sound for repairs. Vancouver realised the importance of verifying Gray's information and conducting a more thorough survey. In October 1792, he sent Lieutenant [[William Robert Broughton]] with several boats up the [[Columbia River]]. Broughton got as far as the [[Columbia River Gorge]], sighting and naming [[Mount Hood]].<ref name=\"Etulain2004\">{{cite book|last=Etulain|first=Richard W.|title=Western Lives: A Biographical History Of The American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yXv_OdXxBUC&pg=PA97|year=2004|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-3472-5|pages=97\u2013101}}</ref>\n\nVancouver sailed south along the coast of Spanish [[Alta California]], visiting [[Chumash people|Chumash]] villages at [[Point Conception]] and near [[Mission San Buenaventura]].<ref name=\"nps.gov\">McLendon, Sally and Johnson, John R.

The accomplished and politically well-connected [[naturalist]] [[Archibald Menzies]] complained that his servant had been pressed into service during a shipboard emergency; [[sailing master]] [[Joseph Whidbey]] had a competing claim for pay as expedition [[astronomer]]; and [[Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford]], whom Vancouver had disciplined for numerous infractions and eventually sent home in disgrace, proceeded to harass him publicly and privately.\n\nPitt's allies, including his cousin, Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]], attacked Vancouver in the press. Thomas Pitt took a more direct approach; on 29 August 1796 he sent Vancouver a letter heaping many insults on the head of his former captain, and challenging him to a duel. Vancouver gravely replied that he was unable \"in a private capacity to answer for his public conduct in his official duty,\" and offered instead to submit to formal examination by [[flag officer]]s. Pitt chose instead to stalk Vancouver, ultimately assaulting him on a London street corner. The terms of their subsequent legal dispute required both parties to keep the peace, but nothing stopped Vancouver's civilian brother Charles from interposing and giving Pitt blow after blow until onlookers restrained the attacker. Charges and counter-charges flew in the press, with the wealthy Camelford faction having the greater firepower until Vancouver, ailing from his long naval service, died.\n\n==Death==\nVancouver, at one time amongst Britain's greatest explorers and navigators, died in obscurity on 10 May 1798 at the age of 40, less than three years after completing his voyages and expeditions.<ref name=cave>{{cite book | last=Cave | first1=Edward (\"Sylvanus Urban\") | authorlink=Edward Cave | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNERAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover| title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]], and Historical Chronicle | chapter=Obituary of Remarkable Persons with Biographical Anecdotes | volume=68 | location=London | publisher=John Nichols | year=1798 | page=447}}</ref> No official cause of death was stated, as the medical records pertaining to Vancouver were destroyed; one doctor named John Naish claimed Vancouver died from kidney failure, while others believed it was a [[Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroid]] condition.<ref name=\"cooksociety\">{{cite web|title=George Vancouver (1757\u20131798) part five: after the voyage|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/george-vancouver-1757-1798-part-five-after-the-voyage|publisher=The Captain Cook Society}}</ref> His grave is in the churchyard of [[St Peter's Church, Petersham]], in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]], England.<ref>{{Find a Grave|4947|Capt George Vancouver}}</ref> [[The Hudson's Bay Company]] placed a memorial plaque in the church in 1841.<ref name= \"Unchartered\">{{cite book | last1=Boyes |first1=Valerie |last2=Wintersinger |first2=Natascha|publisher=[[Museum of Richmond]] | title =Encountering the Unchartered and Back \u2013 three explorers: Ball, Vancouver and Burton|pages=9\u201310 |year=2014 }}</ref> His grave in [[Portland stone]], renovated in the 1960s, is now [[Listed building|Grade II listed]] in view of its historical associations.<ref name= \"Unchartered\"/><ref name=\"Listing\">{{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1380182 | title=Tomb of Captain George Vancouver in the Churchyard of St Peter's Church | work=[[National Heritage List for England]]| publisher=[[English Heritage]]  | accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Navigation===\nVancouver determined that the [[Northwest Passage]] did not exist at the latitudes that had long been suggested. His charts of the North American northwest coast were so extremely accurate that they served as the key reference for coastal navigation for generations. Robin Fisher, the academic Vice-President of [[Mount Royal University]] in Calgary and author of two books on Vancouver, states:\n{{quote|He put the northwest coast on the map...He drew up a map of the north-west coast that was accurate to the 9th degree, to the point it was still being used into the modern day as a navigational aid. That's unusual for a map from that early a time.<ref name=pynn530>Pynn, Larry (30 May 2007) \"Charting the Coast,\" ''The [[Vancouver Sun]]'', p.B3</ref>}}\n\nHowever, Vancouver failed to discover two of the largest and most important rivers on the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]], the [[Fraser River]] and the [[Columbia River]]. He also missed the [[Skeena River]] near Prince Rupert in northern British Columbia. Vancouver did eventually learn of the river before he finished his survey\u2014from [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]], captain of the American merchant ship that conducted the first [[Robert Gray's Columbia River expedition|Euroamerican sailing of the Columbia River]] on 11 May 1792, after first sighting it on an earlier voyage in 1788. However it and the Fraser River never made it onto Vancouver's charts.\nStephen R. Bown, noted in ''[[Mercator's World]]'' magazine (November/December 1999) that:\n\n{{quote|How Vancouver could have missed these rivers while accurately charting hundreds of comparatively insignificant inlets, islands, and streams is hard to fathom.

Historical records show Vancouver enjoyed good relations with native leaders both in Hawaii \u2013 where King [[Kamehameha I]] ceded Hawaii to Vancouver in 1794 \u2013 as well as the Pacific Northwest and California.<ref name=Pynn529>Pynn, Larry \"Peaceful Encounters\" (29 May 2007), ''The [[Vancouver Sun]]'', p. B3</ref> Vancouver's journals exhibit a high degree of sensitivity to natives. He wrote of meeting the [[Chumash people]],<ref name=\"nps.gov\"/> and of his exploration of a small island on the Californian coast on which an important burial site was marked by a sepulchre of \"peculiar character\" lined with boards and fragments of military instruments lying near a square box covered with mats.<ref name=Pynn529/> Vancouver states:\n\n{{quote|This we naturally conjectured contained the remains of some person of consequence, and it much excited the curiosity of some of our party; but as further examination could not possibly have served any useful purpose, and might have given umbrage and pain to the friends of the deceased, should it be their custom to visit the repositories of their dead, I did not think it right that it should be disturbed.<ref name=Pynn529/> }}\n\nVancouver also displayed contempt in his journals towards unscrupulous western traders who provided guns to natives by writing:\n\n{{quote|I am extremely concerned to be compelled to state here, that many of the traders from the civilised world have not only pursued a line of conduct, diametrically opposite to the true principles of justice in their commercial dealings, but have fomented discords, and stirred up contentions, between the different tribes, in order to increase the demand for these destructive engines... They have been likewise eager to instruct the natives in the use of European arms of all descriptions; and have shewn by their own example, that they consider gain as the only object of pursuit; and whether this be acquired by fair and honourable means, or otherwise, so long as the advantage is secured, the manner how it is obtained seems to have been, with too many of them, but a very secondary consideration.<ref name=Pynn529/>}}\n\nRobin Fisher notes that Vancouver's \"relationships with aboriginal groups were generally peaceful; indeed, his detailed survey would not have been possible if they had been hostile.\"<ref name=Pynn529/> While there were hostile incidents at the end of Vancouver's last season \u2013 the most serious of which involved a clash with [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]s at [[Behm Canal]] in southeast Alaska in 1794 \u2013 these were the exceptions to Vancouver's exploration of the US and Canadian Northwest coast.<ref name=Pynn529/>\n\nDespite a long history of warfare between Britain and Spain, Vancouver maintained excellent relations with his Spanish counterparts and even f\u00eated a Spanish sea captain aboard his ship {{HMS|Discovery|1789|2}} during his 1792 trip to the Vancouver region.<ref name=pynn530/>\n\n===Namesakes===\n\n====Ship and cadet units====\n* [[HMCS Vancouver (FFH 331)|HMCS ''Vancouver'']] Halifax-class frigate of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]  \n*TS Vancouver, [[Australian Navy Cadets]]\n* 47 RCSCC CAPTAIN VANCOUVER, [[Royal Canadian Sea Cadets]] [http://www.47rcscc.com/home/]\n\n====Places====\nMany places around the world have been named after George Vancouver, including:\n\n=====Australia=====\n* Vancouver Peninsula, Cape Vancouver and Vancouver Breakers in [[King George Sound]], Western Australia\n\n=====Canada=====\n* [[Mount Vancouver]], in Yukon and neighbouring Alaska, eighth highest mountain in Canada\n* [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, a major city on the mainland in southwestern British Columbia, the province's largest city\n** [[Vancouver Maritime Museum]]\n* [[Vancouver Bay, British Columbia]], in Jervis Inlet, East of Powell River, named after Vancouver when Capt.

It is now commonly accepted that the name Vancouver derives from the expression '''''van Coevorden''''', meaning \"(originating) from [[Coevorden]]\", a city in the northeast of the Netherlands. This city is apparently named after the \"Coeverden\" family of the 13th\u201315th century.<ref>{{cite book|author1=G.H.

Some of them were known as ''[[Van Coeverden]]''. Others adopted the surname [[Oxford]], as in [[ford (crossing)|oxen fording (a river)]], which is approximately the English translation of ''Coevorden''. However, it is not the exact name of the noble family mentioned in the history books that claim Vancouver's noble lineage: that name was Coeverden not Coevorden.\n\nIn the 1970s, Adrien Mansvelt, a former consul general of the Netherlands based in Vancouver, published a collation of information in both historical and genealogical journals and in the ''Vancouver Sun'' newspaper.<ref>Mansvelt, Adrien (February 1975) \"The Vancouver \u2013 Van Coeverden Controversy\".

Robinson</ref>\n\nW. Kaye Lamb, in summarising Mansvelt's 1973 research, observes evidence of close family ties between the Vancouver family of Britain and the Van Coeverden family of the Netherlands as well as George Vancouver's own words from his diaries in referring to his Dutch ancestry:\n\n{{quote|text=As the name Vancouver suggests, the Vancouvers were of Dutch origin. They were descended from the titled van Coeverden family, one of the oldest in the Netherlands. By the twelfth century, and for many years thereafter, their castle at [[Coevorden]], in the Province of [[Drenthe]], was an important fortress on the eastern frontier. George Vancouver was aware of this. In July 1794, he named the [[Lynn Canal]] \"after the place of my nativity\" and Point Couverden (which he spelt incorrectly) \"after the seat of my ancestors\". Vancouver's great grandfather, Reint Wolter van Couverden, was probably the first of the line to establish an English connection. While serving as a squire at one of the German courts he met Johanna (Jane) Lilingston, an English girl who was one of the ladies in waiting. They were married in 1699. Their son, Lucas Hendrik van Couverden, married Vancouver's grandmother, Sarah. In his later years he ''probably'' anglicized his name and spent most of his time in England. By the eighteenth century, the estates of the van Couverdens were mostly in the Province of [[Overijssel]], and some of the family were living in [[Vollenhove]], on the [[Zuider Zee]]. The English and Dutch branches kept in touch, and in 1798 (the date of Vancouver's death) George Vancouver's brother Charles would marry a kinswoman, Louise Josephine van Couverden, of [[Vollenhove]].

Through this [[vowel shift]], all Middle English long vowels changed their pronunciation. In addition, some consonant sounds changed as well, particularly those that became silent; the term ''Great Vowel Shift'' is sometimes used to include these consonant changes as well.\n\nEnglish spelling was first becoming standardized in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the Great Vowel Shift is responsible for the fact that English spellings now often strongly deviate in their [[Phonemic orthography|representation of English pronunciations]].<ref>{{Citation |last1=Denham |first1=Kristin |last2=Lobeck |first2=Anne |title=Linguistics for Everyone: An Introduction | publisher=Cengage Learning | year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0KVSvqvZKYC&pg=PA89 |page=89}}</ref> The Great Vowel Shift was first studied by [[Otto Jespersen]] (1860\u20131943), a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[English studies|Anglicist]], who coined the term.<ref>{{cite book |last=Labov |first=William |authorlink=William Labov |year=1994 |title=Principles of Linguistic Change |isbn=0-631-17914-3 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |page=145}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nThe causes of the Great Vowel Shift have been a source of intense scholarly debate and as yet there is no firm consensus. The greatest changes occurred during the 15th and 16th centuries. Some scholars{{Who|date=April 2018}} have argued that the rapid migration of peoples from northern England to the southeast following the [[Black Death]] caused a mixing of accents that forced a change in the standard London vernacular. Others argue that the influx of [[French language|French]] loanwords was a major factor in the shift.<ref>{{cite book | title=A Biography of the English Language | author1=Millward, C.M.|author2=Hayes, Mary | publisher=Wadsworth Publishing | year=2011 | edition=3rd | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC4_1z292jUC | isbn=978-0495906414 | page=250}}</ref> Yet others assert that because of the increasing prestige of French pronunciations among the middle classes (perhaps related to the English aristocracy's switching from French to English around this time), a process of [[hypercorrection]] may have started a shift that unintentionally resulted in vowel pronunciations that were less like French instead of more.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of English | editor1=Nevalainen, Terttu|editor2=Traugott, Elizabeth Closs | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2012 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v92EdN2fLWkC | asin=B009UU4P66 | page=794}}</ref> An opposing theory states that the wars with France and general anti-French sentiments caused hypercorrection in order to deliberately make English sound less like French.<ref>{{cite web | title=Great Vowel Shift \u2014 part 3 | date=Aug 3, 2010 | author=Asya Pereltsvaig | url=http://www.languagesoftheworld.info/historical-linguistics/great-vowel-shift-part-3.html | website=Languages of the World}}</ref>\n\n==Overall changes==\n{{IPA notice|lang=en}}\nThe main difference between the pronunciation of [[Middle English]] in the year 1400 and [[Modern English]] ([[Received Pronunciation]]) is in the value of the [[Vowel length|long vowels]]. Long vowels in Middle English had \"[[Continental Europe|continental]]\" values, much like those in [[Italian phonology#Vowels|Italian]] and [[Standard German phonology#Vowels|Standard German]], but in standard Modern English, they have entirely different pronunciations.{{Sfn|Lass|2000|p=72}} These differing pronunciations of English vowel letters do not stem from the Great Shift as such, but from the fact that English spelling failed to be adapted to the changes. In fact, [[German language|German]] had undergone vowel changes quite similar to the Great Shift in a slightly earlier period, but the spelling was changed accordingly (e.g. [[Middle High German]] ''b\u012bzen'' \u2192 modern German ''bei\u00dfen'' \"to bite\").\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Word !! colspan=\"2\" | Vowel pronunciation\n|-\n!

The Great Vowel Shift occurred in the lower half of the table, between 1400 and 1600~1700. The changes that happened after 1700 are not considered part of the Great Vowel Shift.

Long ''i'' in ''bite'' was pronounced as {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} so Middle English ''bite'' sounded like Modern English ''beet'' {{IPA|/bi\u02d0t/}}; long ''e'' in ''meet'' was pronounced as {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} so Middle English ''meet'' sounded similar to Modern English ''mate'' {{IPA|/me\u026at/}}; long ''a'' in ''mate'' was pronounced as {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, with a vowel like Scottish English ''ah'' in ''father'' {{IPA|[fa\u02d0\u00f0\u0259r]}}<!--Only because this refers to a specific dialect of English--> or General American short ''o'' in ''cot'' {{IPA|/k\u00e4t/}}; and long ''o'' in ''boot'' was pronounced as {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}, similar to modern ''oa'' in General American ''boat'' {{IPA|/o\u028a/}}. In addition, Middle English had a long {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} in ''beat'', like modern short ''e'' in ''bed'' but pronounced longer, and a long {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} in ''boat''.\n\n===Changes===\nAfter around 1300, the long vowels of Middle English began changing in pronunciation. The two close vowels, {{IPA|/i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}}, became [[diphthong]]s ([[vowel breaking]]), and the other five, {{IPA|/e\u02d0 \u025b\u02d0 a\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0 o\u02d0/}}, underwent an increase in [[Vowel#Height|tongue height]] ([[raising (phonology)|raising]]).\n\nThey occurred over several centuries and can be divided into two phases. The first phase affected the close vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}} and the close-mid vowels {{IPA|/e\u02d0 o\u02d0/}}: {{IPA|/e\u02d0 o\u02d0/}} were raised to {{IPA|/i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}}, and {{IPA|/i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}} became the diphthongs {{IPA|/ei ou/}} or {{IPA|/\u0259i \u0259u/}}.{{sfn|Lass|2000|pp=80\u201383}} The second phase affected the open vowel {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} and the open-mid vowels {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0/}}: {{IPA|/a\u02d0 \u025b\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0/}} were raised, in most cases changing to {{IPA|/e\u02d0 i\u02d0 o\u02d0/}}.{{sfn|Lass|2000|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nThe Great Vowel Shift changed vowels without [[phonological change#Merger|merger]] so Middle English before the vowel shift had the same number of vowel [[phoneme]]s as Early Modern English after the vowel shift. After the Great Vowel Shift, some vowel phonemes began merging. Immediately after the Great Vowel Shift, the vowels of ''meet'' and ''meat'' were different, but they are merged in Modern English, and both words are pronounced as {{IPA|/mi\u02d0t/}}. However, during the 16th and the 17th centuries, there were many different mergers, and some mergers can be seen in individual Modern English words like ''great'', which is pronounced with the vowel {{IPA|/e\u026a/}} as in ''mate'' rather than the vowel {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} as in ''meat''.{{sfn|G\u00f6rlach|1991|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nThis is a simplified picture of the changes that happened between late Middle English and today's English.

The close-mid vowels {{IPA|/e\u02d0 o\u02d0/}} became close {{IPA|/i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}}, and the close vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}} became diphthongs. The first phase was complete in 1500, meaning that by that time, words like ''beet'' and ''boot'' had lost their Middle English pronunciation, and were pronounced with the same vowels as in Modern English. The words ''bite'' and ''out'' were pronounced with diphthongs, but not the same diphthongs as in Modern English.{{sfn|Lass|2000|pp=80\u201383}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ First phase of the Great Vowel Shift\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Word !! colspan=\"2\" | Vowel pronunciation\n|-\n! 1400 !! 1550\n|-\n! bite\n| {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u025bi/}}\n|-\n! meet\n| {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}\n|-\n! out\n| {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254u/}}\n|-\n! boot\n| {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}\n|}\n\nScholars agree that the Middle English close vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}} became diphthongs around the year 1500, but disagree about what diphthongs they changed to.

Later, the diphthongs {{IPA|/ei ou/}} shifted to {{IPA|/\u025bi \u0254u/}}, then {{IPA|/\u0259i \u0259u/}}, and finally to Modern English {{IPA|/a\u026a a\u028a/}}.{{sfn|Lass|2000|pp=80\u201383}} This sequence of events is supported by the testimony of [[orthoepy|orthoepists]] before Hodges<!-- Need to get a first name --> in 1644.\n\nHowever, many scholars such as {{harvcoltxt|Dobson|1968}}, {{harvcoltxt|K\u00f6keritz|1953}}, and {{harvcoltxt|Cercignani|1981}} argue for theoretical reasons that, contrary to what 16th-century witnesses report, the vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}} were actually immediately centralized and lowered to {{IPA|/\u0259i \u0259u/}}.{{refn|group=nb|Centralizing to /\u0268i \u0268u/ and then lowering to /\u0259i \u0259u/ argued by Stockwell (1961).}}\n\nEvidence from northern English and Scots ([[#Northern English and Scots|see below]]) suggests that the close-mid vowels {{IPA|/e\u02d0 o\u02d0/}} were the first to shift.  As the Middle English vowels {{IPA|/e\u02d0 o\u02d0/}} were raised towards {{IPA|/i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}}, they forced the original Middle English {{IPA|/i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}} out of place and caused them to become diphthongs {{IPA|/ei ou/}}.  This type of sound change, in which one vowel's pronunciation shifts so that it is pronounced like a second vowel, and the second vowel is forced to change its pronunciation, is called a [[push chain]].{{sfn|Lass|2000|pp=74\u201377}}\n\nHowever, according to professor J\u00fcrgen Handke, for some time, there was a phonetic split between words with the vowel {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and the diphthong {{IPA|/\u0259i/}}, in words where the Middle English {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} shifted to the Modern English {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}.  For an example, ''high'' was pronounced with the vowel {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, and ''like'' and ''my'' were pronounced with the diphthong {{IPA|/\u0259i/}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyhZ8NQOZeo |title=PHY117 \u2013 The Great Vowel Shift |author=J\u00fcrgen Handke |date=Dec 7, 2012 |publisher=The Virtual Linguistics Campus |website=YouTube}}</ref> Therefore, for logical reasons, the close vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}} could have diphthongized before the close-mid vowels {{IPA|/e\u02d0 o\u02d0/}} raised.  Otherwise, ''high'' would probably rhyme with ''thee'' rather than ''my''.  This type of chain is called a [[chain shift|drag chain]].\n\n===Second phase===\nThe second phase of the Great Vowel Shift affected the Middle English open vowel {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, as in ''mate'', and the Middle English open-mid vowels {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0/}}, as in ''meat'' and ''boat''. Around 1550, Middle English {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} was raised to {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}}. Then, after 1600, the new {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} was raised to {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}, with the Middle English open-mid vowels {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0/}} raised to close-mid {{IPA|/e\u02d0 o\u02d0/}}. {{sfn|Lass|2000|pp=83\u201385}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Second phase of the Great Vowel Shift\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Word !! colspan=\"3\" | Vowel pronunciation\n|-\n! 1400 !! 1550 !! 1640\n|-\n! meat\n| {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}}\n|-\n! mate\n| {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}\n|-\n! boat\n| {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}\n|}\n\n===Later mergers===\nDuring the first and the second phases of the Great Vowel Shift, long vowels were shifted without merging with other vowels, but after the second phase, several vowels merged. The later changes also involved the Middle English diphthong {{IPA|/ai/}}, as in ''day'', which had monophthongised to {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}, and merged with Middle English {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} as in ''mate'' or {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} as in ''meat''.{{sfn|G\u00f6rlach|1991|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, several different pronunciation variants existed among different parts of the population for words like ''meet'', ''meat'', ''mate'', and ''day''. In each pronunciation variant, different pairs or trios of words were merged in pronunciation. Four different pronunciation variants are shown in the table below. The fourth pronunciation variant gave rise to Modern English pronunciation. In Modern English, ''meet'' and ''meat'' are merged in pronunciation and both have the vowel {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, and ''mate'' and ''day'' are merged with the diphthong {{IPA|/e\u026a/}}, which developed from the 16th-century long vowel {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}}.{{sfn|G\u00f6rlach|1991|pp=68\u201369}}<!-- G\u00f6rlach cites Samuels (1972: 147) for variants I, II, and III, and adds the pronunciation given by John Hart.

Words like ''great'' and ''steak'', however, have merged with ''mate'' and are pronounced with the vowel {{IPA|/e\u026a/}}, which developed from the {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} shown in the table above.\n\n==Northern English and Scots==\nThe Great Vowel Shift affected other dialects as well as the standard English of southern England but in different ways. In [[English in northern England|Northern England]], the long [[back vowel]]s remained unaffected because the long mid back vowel had undergone an earlier shift.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wales |first=K |year=2006 |title=Northern English: a cultural and social history |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University |page=48}}</ref> Similarly, the [[Scots language]] in [[Scotland]] had a different vowel system before the Great Vowel Shift, as {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} had shifted to {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} in [[Early Scots]]. In the Scots equivalent of the Great Vowel Shift, the long vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} shifted to {{IPA|/ei/}}, {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} by the [[Middle Scots]] period and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} remained unaffected.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Macafee |first1=Caroline |last2=Aitken |first2=A.

The Northern English developments of Middle English {{IPA|/i\u02d0, e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/o\u02d0, u\u02d0/}} were different from Southern English. In particular, the Northern English vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} in  ''bite'', {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} in ''feet'', and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} in ''boot'' shifted, while the vowel {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} in ''house'' did not:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Word !! colspan=\"3\" | Vowel\n|-\n!

Southern\n|-\n! bite\n| {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u025bi/}} || {{IPA|/ai/}}\n|-\n! feet\n| {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}\n|-\n! house\n| {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/au/}}\n|-\n! boot\n| {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}<!-- The Scots version of \"boot\" is spelled \"buitt\" according to the OED. --> || {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}\n|}\n\nThe vowel systems of Northern and Southern Middle English immediately before the Great Vowel Shift were different in one way. In Northern Middle English, the back close-mid vowel {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} in ''boot'' had already shifted to front {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} (a sound change known as [[fronting (phonetics)|fronting]]), like the long ''{{lang|de|\u00f6}}'' in German {{wikt-lang|de|h\u00f6ren}} {{IPA-de|\u02c8h\u00f8\u02d0\u0281\u0259n||De-h\u00f6ren.ogg}} \"hear\". Thus, Southern English had a back close-mid vowel {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}, but Northern English did not:{{sfn|Lass|2000|pp=74\u201377}}\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable nowrap\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Southern Middle English<br>vowel system\n!\n! front !! back\n|-\n! close\n| {{IPA|i\u02d0}} || {{IPA|u\u02d0}}\n|-\n! close-mid\n| {{IPA|e\u02d0}} || {{IPA|o\u02d0}}\n|-\n! open-mid\n| {{IPA|\u025b\u02d0}} || {{IPA|\u0254\u02d0}}\n|-\n! open\n| {{IPA|a\u02d0}} || \u2014\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable nowrap\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Northern Middle English<br>vowel system\n!\n! front !! back\n|-\n! close\n| {{IPA|i\u02d0}} || {{IPA|u\u02d0}}\n|-\n! close-mid\n| {{IPA|e\u02d0, \u00f8\u02d0}} || \u2014\n|-\n! open-mid\n| {{IPA|\u025b\u02d0}} || {{IPA|\u0254\u02d0}}\n|-\n! open\n| {{IPA|a\u02d0}} || \u2014\n|}\n|}\nIn both Northern and Southern English, the first step of the Great Vowel Shift raised the close-mid vowels to become close. Northern Middle English had two close-mid vowels \u2013 {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} in ''feet'' and {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} in ''boot'' \u2013 which were raised to {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}. Later on, Northern English {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}} changed to {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, so that ''boot'' has the same vowel as ''feet''. Southern Middle English had two close-mid vowels \u2013 {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} in ''feet'' and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} in ''boot'' \u2013 which were raised to {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}.\n\nIn Southern English, the close vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} in ''bite'' and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} in ''house'' shifted to become diphthongs, but in Northern English, {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} in ''bite'' shifted but {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} in ''house'' did not.\n\nIf the difference between the Northern and Southern vowel shifts is caused by the vowel systems at the time of the Great Vowel Shift, {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} did not shift because there was no back mid vowel {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} in Northern English. In Southern English, shifting of {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} to {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} could have caused{{Why|date=December 2015}} diphthongisation of original {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, but because Northern English had no back close-mid vowel {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} to shift, the back close vowel {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} did not diphthongise.\n\n== Exceptions ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nNot all words underwent certain phases of the Great Vowel Shift.  Examples are ''[[father]]'', which failed to become {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}, and ''broad'', which failed to become {{IPA|/o\u028a/}}. The word ''room'', which was spelled as ''roum'' in Middle English, retains its Middle English pronunciation. It is an exception to the shifting of {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} to {{IPA|/a\u028a/}} because it is followed by ''m'', a [[labial consonant]].\n\nThe class ''ea'' did not take the step to {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} in several words. The presence of {{IPA |/r/}} in ''swear'' and ''bear'' caused the vowel quality to be retained{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} but not in the cases of ''[[hearing|hear]]'' and ''near''.\nShortening of long vowels at various stages produced further complications: ''ea'' is again a good example by shortening commonly before [[coronal consonant]]s such as ''d'' and ''th'', thus: ''dead'', ''head'', ''threat'', ''wealth'' etc. (That is known as the [[Phonological history of English high front vowels|bred\u2013bread merger]].){{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The ''oo'' was shortened from {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} to {{IPA|/\u028a/}}, in many cases before ''k'', ''d'' and less commonly ''t'': ''book'', ''foot'', ''good'', etc. Some words subsequently changed from {{IPA|/\u028a/}} to {{IPA|/\u028c/}}: ''blood'', ''flood''. Similar but older shortening occurred for some instances of ''ou'': ''could''.\n\nSome [[loanword]]s, such as ''[[souffl\u00e9]]'' and ''umlaut'', have retained a spelling from their origin language that may seem similar to the previous examples; but, since they were not a part of English at the time of the Great Vowel Shift, they are not actually exceptions to the shift.\n\n== Related consonant changes ==\nDuring this same period, there were a number of consonant changes, particularly changes that were in combination with the vowel changes, or cases of silencing of consonants. An often-cited example is the word ''knight'', which in Middle English was pronounced {{IPA|/kni:xt/}}. The ''k'' and the ''gh'' were silenced, but additionally the ''i'' changed its value to {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}. This vowel shift, of course, was not independent of the consonant shift as it was the combined sound {{IPA|/ix/}} that actually made the transition to {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}.\n\nThe following are examples of some of the most common consonant-related shifts that occurred:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Word !! colspan=\"2\" | Vowel pronunciation\n|-\n!

The standard spellings were those of Middle English pronunciation, and spelling conventions continued from Old English.

Stanford]].{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\nWith the composer [[Alfred Cellier]], Beckett wrote the operetta ''Two Foster Brothers'' ([[St. George's Hall (London)|St. George's Hall]], 1877).\n\nIn 1879, he had been asked by [[Tom Taylor]], the editor of ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'', to follow the example of his younger brother Arthur, and become a regular member of the staff of ''Punch.'' \nThree years later he was 'appointed to the Table.' \nThe ''Punch'' dinners 'were his greatest pleasure, and he attended them with regularity, although the paralysis of the legs, the result of falling down the stairway of [[Gower Street station]], rendered his locomotion, and especially the mounting of Mr. Punch's staircase, a matter of painful exertion'. \nTo ''Punch'' he contributed both prose and verse; he wrote, in greater part, the admirable parody of a boy's sensational shocker (March 1882), and he developed Jerrold's idea of humorous bogus advertisements under the heading 'How we advertise now.' \nThe idea of one of Sir [[John Tenniel]]'s best cartoons for ''Punch,'' entitled 'Dropping the Pilot,' illustrative of Bismarck's resignation in 1889, was due to him.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\nApart from his work on 'Punch,' he wrote songs and music for the German Reeds' entertainment, while in 1873 and 1874 he was collaborator in two dramatic productions which evoked a considerable amount of public attention.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\n[[File:The Happy Land - Illustrated London News, March 22, 1873.PNG|thumb|300px|Scene from ''The Happy Land'', showing the impersonation of Gladstone, Lowe, and Ayrton, from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', March 22, 1873]]\nOn 3 March 1873, ''[[The Happy Land]]'' was given at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], 1873, a daring political satire and burlesque of W. S. Gilbert's ''[[The Wicked World]]''. \nIn this amusing piece of banter three statesmen (Gladstone, Lowe, and Ayrton) were represented as visiting Fairyland in order to impart to the inhabitants the secrets of popular government. The actors representing 'Mr. G.,' 'Mr. L.,' and 'Mr. A.' were dressed so as to resemble the ministers satirised, and the representation elicited a question in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and an official visit of the Lord Chamberlain to the theatre, with the result that the actors had to change their 'make-up.'{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\nIn the following year, he furnished the 'legend' to [[Herman Merivale]]'s tragedy 'The White Pilgrim,' first given at the Court in February 1874. \nAt the close of his life he furnished the 'lyrics' and most of the book for the operetta 'La Cigale,' which at the time of his death was nearing its four hundredth performance at the Lyric Theatre.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\nIn 1889, he suffered a great shock from the death by drowning of his only son, and he died in London on 15 October 1891, and was buried in Mortlake cemetery.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\n==Legacy==\n''Punch'' devoted some appreciative stanzas to his memory, bearing the epigraph 'Wearing the white flower of a blameless life' (24 Oct. 1891). His portrait appeared in the well-known drawing of 'The Mahogany Tree' (''Punch'', Jubilee Number, 18 July 1887), and likenesses were also given in the 'Illustrated London News' and in Spielmann's 'History of Punch' (1895).{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}} \n==Family==\nHe married Emily, eldest daughter of William Hunt, J.P., of Bath, and his only daughter Minna married in 1896 Mr. Hugh Clifford, C.M.G., governor of Labuan and British North Borneo.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;Attribution\n{{DNBsupp|wstitle=\u00c0 Beckett, Gilbert Arthur |first=Thomas|last=Seccombe|pages=7-8}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_gilbert/html/happy_land_home.html Information about ''The Happy Land'']\n*{{cite ODNB|first=Katherine|last= Mullin|title=\u00c0 Beckett, Gilbert Arthur (1837\u20131891)| id= 27}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abeckett, Gilbert Arthur}}\n[[Category:1837 births]]\n[[Category:1891 deaths]]\n[[Category:People associated with Gilbert and Sullivan]]", "sha1": "narp7renszsd3adtpsmxdiaafh9j12y"}}, {"title": "Glaucus (disambiguation)", "ns": "0", "id": "12875", "revision": {"id": "856580675", "parentid": "829565294", "timestamp": "2018-08-26T06:49:11Z", "contributor": {"username": "Markx121993", "id": "30657704"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{wiktionary|Glaucus}}\n'''Glaucus''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0261|l|\u0254\u02d0|k|\u0259|s}}; {{lang-el|Glaukos|script=Latn}}, \"greyish blue\" or \"bluish green\" and \"glimmering\") is a Greek name.

He returned home in 1667, was admitted advocate in 1668 and gained a high legal reputation.  He represented Aberdeenshire in the [[Parliament of Scotland]] of 1669 and in the following assemblies, during his first session strongly opposing the projected [[union of the two legislatures]].  In November 1678 he was made a [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Counsellor]] for [[Scotland]], and in 1680 was raised to the [[Court of Session|bench]] as Lord Haddo.  He was a leading member of the [[James II of England|Duke of York]]'s administration, was created a [[Lords of the Articles|Lord of the Articles]] in June and in November 1681 [[Privy Council of Scotland|Lord President of the Privy Council]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=45\u201346}}  The same year he is reported as moving in the council for the torture of witnesses.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|pp=45\u201346}} cites Sir J.

He took an active part in parliament in 1685 and 1686, but remained a non-juror during the whole of [[William III of England|William]]'s reign, being frequently fined for his non-attendance, and took the oaths for the first time after Anne's accession, on 11 May 1703.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=45\u201346}}\n\nIn the great affair of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Union in 1707]], while protesting against the completion of the treaty till the [[Alien Act 1705 |act declaring the Scots aliens]] should be repealed, he refused to support the opposition to the measure itself and refrained from attending parliament when the treaty was settled.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=45\u201346}}\n\nHe is described by John Mackay as, \"...very knowing in the laws and constitution of his country and is believed to be the solidest statesman in Scotland, a fine orator, speaks slow but sure.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=45\u201346}}\n\nHis person was said to be deformed,{{By whom?|date=August 2017}} and his ''want of mine or deportment'' was alleged as a disqualification for the office of Lord Chancellor.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n==Family==\nHe married [[Anne Lockhart, Countess of Aberdeen|Anne Lockhart]], daughter and (eventual) sole heiress of [[George Lockhart of Tarbrax]] and Anne Lockhart.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=45\u201346}} They had several children:{{sfn|Paul|1904|p=89}}\n*John Gordon (1673\u20131675)\n*Hon.

name=EB/> styled '''Lord Haddo''' from 1791 to 1801, was a British politician, diplomat and landowner, successively a [[Tory]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Peelite]], who served as Prime Minister  from 1852 until 1855 in a coalition between the Whigs and Peelites, with Radical and Irish support. The [[Aberdeen ministry]] was filled with powerful and talented politicians, whom Aberdeen was largely unable to control and direct. Despite trying to avoid this happening, it took Britain into the [[Crimean War]], and fell when its conduct became unpopular, after which Aberdeen retired from politics.\n\nAberdeen's career was dominated by foreign policy, but his experience did not prevent the slide towards the Crimean War. His personal life was marked by the loss of both parents by the time he was eleven, and of his first wife after only seven years of a happy marriage. His daughters died young, and his relations with his sons were difficult.<ref>MacIntyre, 644</ref> Before his marriage he travelled extensively in Europe, including Greece, and he had a serious interest in the classical civilisations and their archaeology. On his return to Britain in 1805 he devoted much time and energy to improving conditions on his Scottish estates.\n\nAfter the death of his wife in 1812 he became a diplomat, almost immediately being given the important embassy to [[Vienna]] while still in his twenties. His rise in politics was equally rapid and lucky, and \"two accidents \u2014 [[George Canning|Canning's]] death and Wellington's impulsive acceptance of the Canningite resignations\" led to him becoming Foreign Secretary to the [[Duke of Wellington]] in 1828 despite \"an almost ludicrous lack of official experience\"; he had been a minister for less than six months. After holding the position for two years, followed by another cabinet role, by 1841 his experience led to his appointment as Foreign Secretary again under [[Robert Peel]] for a longer term.<ref>MacIntyre, 641</ref> This was despite his being a \"notoriously bad speaker\", which mattered far less in the [[House of Lords]], and having a \"dour, awkward, occasionally sarcastic exterior\".<ref>MacIntyre, 642, 644, both quoted</ref>  Nonetheless his [[Peelite]] colleague, later himself Prime Minister, [[William Ewart Gladstone]], said of him that he was \"the man in public life of all others whom I have {{em|loved}}. I say emphatically {{em|loved}}. I have {{em|loved}} others, but never like him\".<ref>MacIntyre, 643, quoted</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Edinburgh]] on 28 January 1784, he was the eldest son of [[George Gordon, Lord Haddo]], son of [[George Gordon, 3rd Earl of Aberdeen]]. His mother was Charlotte, youngest daughter of William Baird of Newbyth.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Dod | first = Robert P. | title = The Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland | year = 1860 | publisher = Whitaker and Co. | location = London | pages = 81 }}</ref> He lost his father in 1791 and his mother in 1795 and was brought up by [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville]] and [[William Pitt the Younger]].<ref name=EB/> He was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] in 1804.<ref>{{acad|id=GRDN800GH|name=Gordon, George Hamilton (Lord Haddo)}}</ref> Before this, however, he had become [[Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Earl of Aberdeen]] on his grandfather's death in 1801,<ref name=EB/> and had travelled all over Europe. On his return to England, he founded the Athenian Society. In 1805, he married Lady Catherine Elizabeth, daughter of [[John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn]].\n\n==Political and diplomatic career, 1805\u20131828==\nIn December 1805 Lord Aberdeen took his seat as a [[Tory]] [[Representative peer|Scottish representative peer]] in the [[House of Lords]]. In 1808, he was created a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]]. Following the death of his wife from [[tuberculosis]] in 1812 he joined the Foreign Service. He was appointed [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Austria|Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Austria]],<ref name=EB/> and signed the [[Treaty of T\u00f6plitz]] between Britain and Austria in [[Vienna]] in October 1813. In the company of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|the Austrian Emperor, Francis II]] he was an observer at the decisive Coalition victory of the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813; he had met [[Napoleon]] in his earlier travels. He became one of the central diplomatic figures in European diplomacy at this time,<ref name=EB/> and he was one of the British representatives at the [[Congress of Ch\u00e2tillon]] in February 1814, and at the negotiations which led to the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] in May of that year.<ref name=EB/><ref>[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 4</ref>\n\nAberdeen was greatly affected by the aftermath of war which he witnessed at first hand.  He wrote home:\n\n<blockquote>The near approach of war and its effects are horrible beyond what you can conceive.  The whole road from Prague to [Teplitz] was covered with waggons full of wounded, dead, and dying.  The shock and disgust and pity produced by such scenes are beyond what I could have supposed possible...the scenes of distress and misery have sunk deeper in my mind.  I have been quite haunted by them.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur|title=The Earl of Aberdeen|date=1893|publisher=Sampson Low, Marston and Company|location=London|page=31}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Shield of arms of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, KG, KT, FRSE, FRS, PC.png|thumb|upright|left|Shield of arms of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, as displayed on his [[Order of the Garter]] stall plate in [[St George's Chapel]].]]\nReturning home he was created a peer of the United Kingdom as '''Viscount Gordon''', of Aberdeen in the County of Aberdeen (1814),<ref name=EB/> and made a member of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. In July 1815 he married his former sister-in-law Harriet, daughter of John Douglas, and widow of [[James Hamilton, Viscount Hamilton]]; the marriage was much less happy than his first. During the ensuing thirteen years Aberdeen took a less prominent part in public affairs.\n\n==Political career, 1828\u20131852==\nLord Aberdeen served as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] between January and June 1828 and subsequently as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] until 1830 under the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].<ref name=EB/> He resigned with Wellington over the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill of 1832]].\n[[File:George Hamilton Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen by John Partridge.jpg|thumb|Lord Aberdeen {{c.|1847}} by [[John Partridge (artist)|John Partridge]]]]\n\nHe was [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] between 1834 and 1835, and again Foreign Secretary between 1841 and 1846 under [[Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Peel]]. It was during his second stint as Foreign Secretary, that he had the harbor settlement of 'Little Hong Kong', on the south side of Hong Kong Island named after him. It was probably the most productive period of his career, that he settled two disagreements with the US \u2013 the Northeast Boundary dispute by the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] (1842), and the [[Oregon boundary dispute|Oregon dispute]] by the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846.<ref name=EB/> He also worked successfully to improve relationships with France, where [[Guizot]] had become a personal friend. He enjoyed the trust of [[Queen Victoria]], which was still important for a Foreign Secretary. He again followed his leader and resigned with Peel over the issue of the [[Corn Laws]].\n\nAfter Peel's death in 1850 he became the recognised leader of the [[Peelites]]. In July 1852, a general election of Parliament was held which resulted in the election of 325 Tory/Conservative party members to Parliament. This represented 42.7% seats in Parliament. The main opposition to the Tory/Conservative Party was the Whig Party, which elected 292 members of the party to the Parliament in July 1852. Although occupying fewer seats than the Tory/Conservatives, the Whigs had a chance to draw support from the minor parties and independents who were also elected in July 1852. Lord Aberdeen as the leader of the Peelites was one of 38 Peelites elected to members of Parliament independently of the Tory/Conservative Party.<ref>Lucille Iremonger, ''Lord Aberdeen: a biography of the fourth Earl of Aberdeen, KG, KT, Prime Minister 1852\u20131855'' (1978).</ref>\n\nWhile the Peelites agreed with the Whigs on issues dealing with the international trade, there were other issues which the Peelites disagreed with the Whigs. Indeed, Lord Aberdeen's own dislike of the [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851|Ecclesiastical Titles Assumption Bill]], the rejection of which he failed to secure in 1851, prevented him from joining the Whig government of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] in 1851. Additionally, 113 of the members of Parliament elected in July 1852 were [[Free Traders]].<ref>Karl Marx, \"Result of the Elections\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Freederick Engels: Volume 11,'' p. 352.</ref> These members agreed with the Peelites on the repeal of the \"[[Corn Laws]],\" but they felt that the tariffs on ''all'' consumer products should be removed.\n\nFurthermore, 63 members of Parliament elected in 1852, were members of the \"[[Independent Irish Party|Irish Brigade]],\" who voted with the Peelites and the Whigs for the repeal of the Corn Laws because they sought an end the Great Irish Famine by means of cheaper wheat and bread prices for the poor and middle classes in Ireland.  Currently, however, neither the Free Traders and the Irish Brigade had disagreements with the Whigs that prevented them from joining with the Whigs form a government. Accordingly, the Tory/Conservative Party leader the [[Earl of Derby]] was asked to form a \"minority government\". However, the Earl of Derby appointed [[Benjamin Disraeli]] as the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the minority government.\n\nWhen in December 1852, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer submitted his budget to Parliament on behalf of the minority government, the Peelites, the Free Traders and the Irish Brigade were all alienated by the proposed budget. Accordingly, each of these groups suddenly forgot their differences with the Whig Party and voted with the Whigs against the proposed budget. The vote was 286 in favour of the budget and 305 votes against the budget.<ref>Karl Marx, \"The Defeat of the Ministry\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: volume 11,'' p. 466.</ref> Because the leadership of the minority government had made the vote on the budget vote a \"vote of confidence\" in the minority government, the defeat of the Disraeli budget was a \"vote of no confidence\" in the minority government and meant the downfall of the minority government. Accordingly, Lord Aberdeen was asked to form a new government.\n\n==Prime Minister, 1852\u20131855==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen]], [[Premiership of Lord Aberdeen]], [[Premiership of the Earl of Aberdeen]], [[Prime ministership of Lord Aberdeen]], [[Prime ministership of the Earl of Aberdeen]] -->\n{{Further|Aberdeen ministry}}\n[[File:George Hamilton-Gordon.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Aberdeen in the 1850s]] Following the downfall of the Tory/Conservative minority government under Lord Derby in December 1852, Lord Aberdeen formed a new government from the coalition of Free Traders, Peelites and Whigs that had voted no confidence in the minority government. Lord Aberdeen was able to put together a coalition government of these groups that held 53.8% of the seats of Parliament. Thus Lord Aberdeen, a Peelite, became Prime Minister and headed a coalition ministry of Whigs and Peelites.\n\nAlthough united on international trade issues and on questions of domestic reform, his cabinet which also contained Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, who were certain to differ on questions of foreign policy. [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] says in his ''Memoirs'', \"In the present cabinet are five or six first-rate men of equal, or nearly equal, pretensions, none of them likely to acknowledge the superiority or defer to the opinions of any other, and every one of these five or six considering himself abler and more important than their premier\"; and [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Sir James Graham]] wrote, \"It is a powerful team, but it will require good driving\"; this Aberdeen was unable to provide.  During the  administration, much trouble was caused by the rivalry between these two, and over the course of it Palmerston managed to out-manoeuvre Russell to emerge as the Whig heir-apparent.<ref>Martin, 110\u2013112</ref>  The cabinet also included a single Radical [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|Sir William Molesworth]], but much later, when justifying to the Queen his own new appointments, Gladstone told her: \"For instance, even in Ld Aberdeen's Govt, in 52, Sir William Molesworth had been selected, at that time, a very advanced Radical, but who was perfectly harmless, & took little, or no part&nbsp;... He said these people generally became very moderate, when they were in office\", which she admitted had been the case.<ref>Queen Victoria's Journals, Wednesday 28 April 1880, Windsor Castle, from Princess Beatrice's copies, Volume72 (1 January 1880-18 August 1880), p.167, [http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/search/displayItem.do?FormatType=fulltextimgsrc&QueryType=articles&ResultsID=2738816315824&filterSequence=0&PageNumber=1&ItemNumber=14&ItemID=qvj17246&volumeType=PSBEA online from the Bodleian Library]</ref>\n\nOne of the foreign policy issues on which Palmerston and Russell disagreed was the type of relationship that Britain should have with France and especially France's ruler, [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]]. Bonaparte was the nephew of the famous [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who had become dictator and then Emperor of France from 1804 until 1814. Bonaparte had been elected to a three-year term as President of the Second Republic of France on 20 December 1848. The Constitution of the Second Republic limited the President to a single term in office. Thus, Louis Bonaparte would be unable to succeed himself and after 20 December 1851 would no longer be President. Thus, on 2 December 1851, shortly before the end of his single three-year term in office was to expire, [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|Bonaparte staged a coup against the Second Republic in France]], disbanded the elected Constituent Assembly, arrested some of the Republican leaders and declared himself Emperor Napoleon III of France. This coup upset many democrats in England as well as in France. Some British government officials felt that Louis Bonaparte was seeking foreign adventure in the spirit of his uncle\u2014Napoleon I. Consequently, these officials felt that any close association with Bonaparte would eventually lead Britain into another series of wars, like the [[Napoleonic Wars|wars with France and Napoleon]] dating from 1793 until 1815. British relations with France had scarcely improved since 1815. As prime minister, the Earl of Aberdeen was one of these officials, who feared France and Bonaparte.<ref>Jonathan Philip Parry,  \"The impact of Napoleon III on British politics, 1851\u20131880.\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (Sixth Series) 11 (2001): 147\u2013175.</ref>\n\nHowever, other British government officials were beginning to worry more about the rising political dominance of the [[Russian Empire]] in eastern Europe and the corresponding decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Lord Palmerston]], who at the time of Louis Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup was serving as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Whig government of Prime Minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]. Without informing the rest of the cabinet or Queen Victoria, Palmerston had sent a private note to the French ambassador endorsing Louis Bonaparte's coup and congratulating Louis Bonaparte, himself, on the coup. Queen Victoria and members of the Russell government demanded that Palmerston be dismissed as Foreign Minister. Russell requested Palmerston's resignation and Palmerston reluctantly provided it.\n\nIn February 1852, Palmerston took revenge on Russell by voting with the Conservatives in a \"no confidence\" vote against the Russell government. This brought an end to the Russell Whig government and set the stage for a general election in July 1852 which eventually brought the Conservatives to power in a minority government under the Earl of Derby. Another problem facing the Earl of Aberdeen in the formation of his new government in December 1852, was Lord John Russell himself. Russell was the leader of the Whig Party, the largest group in the coalition government. Consequently, Lord Aberdeen, was required to appoint Russell as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which he had done on 29 December 1852. However, Russell sometimes liked to use this position to speak for the whole government, as if he were the prime minister. In 1832, Russell had been nicknamed \"Finality John\" because of his statement that the 1832 Reform Act had just been approved by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords would be the \"final\" expansion of the vote in Britain. There would be no further extension of the ballot to the common people of Britain. However, as political pressure in favour of further reform had risen over the twenty years since 1832, Russell had changed his mind. While the Whigs were still part of the Opposition under the minority government of the Earl of Derby, Russell had said, in January 1852, that he intended to introduce a new reform bill into the House of Commons which would equalise the populations of the districts from which members of Parliament were elected. Probably as a result of their continuing feud,  Palmerston declared himself against this Reform Bill of 1852. As a result, support for the Reform Bill of 1852 dwindled and Russell was forced to change his mind again and not introduce the any Reform Bill in 1852.<ref>C. H. Stuart, \"The Formation of the Coalition Cabinet of 1852.\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (Fifth Series) 4 (1954): 45\u201368.</ref>\n\nIn order to form the coalition government, the Earl of Aberdeen had been required to appoint both Palmerston and Russell to his cabinet. Because of the controversy surrounding Palmerston's removal as [[Foreign Minister|Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]] because of his letter to the French ambassador endorsing Louis Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, Palmerston could not now be appointed Foreign Minister again so soon after his removal from the same position. Thus on 28 December 1852, the Earl of Aberdeen appointed Palmerston as [[Home Secretary]] and appointed Russell as Foreign Minister.<ref>Stuart, \"The Formation of the Coalition Cabinet of 1852.\" (1954): 45\u201368.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Norman McCord|author2=Bill Purdue|title=British History 1815\u20131914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9yjeJEfq7cC&pg=PA269|year=2007|publisher=Oxford UP|page=269ff}}</ref>\n\n==The \"Eastern Question\"==\nGiven the differences of opinion within the Lord Aberdeen cabinet over the direction of foreign policy with regard to relations between Britain and the French under Napoleon III, it is not surprising that debate raged within the government as Louis Bonaparte, now assuming the title of Emperor Napoleon III of France. As Prime Minister of the Peelite/Whig coalition government, the Earl of Aberdeen eventually led Britain into war on the side of the French/Ottomans against the Russian Empire. This war would eventually be called [[Crimean War]], but the entire foreign policy negotiations surrounding the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, which would continue throughout the middle and end of nineteenth century the problem would be referred to as the \"[[Eastern Question]]\".  Aberdeen was ordinarily a sympathiser with Russian interests against French/Napoleonic interests. Thus, he was really not in favour of the entrance of into the Crimean War. However, he was following the pressure that was being exerted on him from some members of his cabinet, including Palmerston, who in this rare instance was actually being supported by John Russell, both of whom were in favour of a more aggressive policy against perceived Russian expansion. Aberdeen, unable to control Palmerston, acquiesced. However the Eastern Question and the resulting Crimean War proved to be the downfall of his government.<ref>M.S.Anderson, ''The Eastern Question, 1774\u20131923'' (London, 1966),  pp. 110\u201349.</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Question began as early as the 2 December 1852 with the Napoleonic coup against the Second Republic of France. As he was forming his new imperial government, Napoleon III sent an ambassador to the Ottoman Empire with instructions to assert France's right to protect Christian sites in [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]]. The Ottoman Empire agreed to this condition to avoid conflict or potential war with France. Aberdeen, as Foreign Secretary, had himself tacitly authorised the construction of the first [[Christ Church, Jerusalem|Anglican church in Jerusalem]] in 1845, following his predecessor's commission in 1838 of the first European Consul in Jerusalem on Britain's behalf, which lead to series of successive appointments by other nations. Both resulted from [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]]'s canvassing with substantial public support.<ref name= Lewis>{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Donald | title = The Origins of Christian Zionism: Lord Shaftesbury And Evangelical Support For A Jewish Homeland | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2 January 2014 | location = Cambridge | page = 380 | isbn =9781107631960}}</ref><ref name= sokolow>{{cite book | last = Sokolow | first = Nahum| title = History of Zionism, 1600-1918 | publisher = Forgotten Books | date = 2015-09-27 | volume= 1 | location = Charleston SC USA | page = 418 | isbn =9781330331842}}</ref><ref name= Hyamson>[[Albert Montefiore Hyamson|Hyamson, Albert M.]], The British Consulate in Jerusalem in Relation to the Jews of Palestine, 1838-1914, {{ISBN|978-0404562786}}, cited in Lewis, D.</ref> Nevertheless, Britain became increasingly worried about the situation in Turkey and Prime Minister Aberdeen sent [[Lord Stratford de Redcliffe]], a diplomat with vast experience in Turkey, as a special envoy to the Ottoman Empire to guard British interests. Russia protested the Turkish agreement with the French as a violation of the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] of 1778\u2014the treaty which ended the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u201374)]]. Under this treaty, the Russians had been granted the exclusive right to protect the Christian sites in the Holy Land. Accordingly. on 7 May 1853, the Russians sent Prince [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov]], one their premier statesmen to negotiate a settlement of the issue.<ref>Karl Marx, \"Affairs in Holland\u2014Denmark\u2014Conversion of the British Debt\u2014India, Turkey and Russia\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12'', p. 105.</ref> Prince Menshikov called the attention of the Turks to the fact that during the Russo-Turkish War, the Russians had occupied the Turkish controlled provinces of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] on the north bank of the Danube River, but he reminded them that pursuant to the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca, however, the Russians had returned these \"Danubian provinces\" to Ottoman control in exchange for the right to protect the Christian sites in the Holy Land. Accordingly, the Turks reversed themselves and agreed with the Russians.\n\nThe French sent one of their premier [[ship of the line|ships-of-the-line]], the ''[[French ship Charlemagne (1852)|Charlemagne]]'' to the Black Sea as a show of force. In light of the French show of force, the Turks, again, reversed themselves and recognised the French right to protect the Christian sites. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe was advising the Ottomans during this time<ref>Karl Marx \"Mazzini\u2014Switzerland and Austria\u2014Turkish Question\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12'', p. 109.</ref> and later, it was alleged, that he had been instrumental in persuading the Turks to reject the Russian arguments.\n\nAs war became inevitable, Aberdeen wrote to Russell:\n<blockquote>The abstract justice of the cause, although indisputable, is but a poor consolation for the inevitable calamities of all war, or for a decision which I am not without fear may prove to have been impolitic and unwise.  My conscience upbraids me the more, because seeing, as I did from the first, all that was to be apprehended, it is possible that by a little more energy and vigour, not on the Danube, but in Downing Street, it might have been prevented.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walpole|first1=Spencer|title=The Life of Lord John Russell \u2013 Volume II|date=1889|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London|page=204}}</ref><br /><br /></blockquote>\n\n==Crimean War 1853\u20131856==\n[[File:Coalition Ministry of 1854.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The coalition [[Aberdeen ministry]] of 1854 after a painting by [[John Gilbert (painter)|Sir John Gilbert]], 1855]]\n\nIn response this latest change of mind by the Ottomans/Turks, the Russians, on 2 July 1853 occupied the Turkish-satellite states of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], as they had during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768\u20131774.<ref>Karl Marx, \"Turkey and Russia\u2014the Connivance of the Aberdeen Ministry with Russia\u2014The Budget\u2014Tax on Newspaper Supplements\u2014Parliamentary Corruption\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12'', p. 145.</ref> Almost immediately, the Russian troops deployed along the northern banks of the Danube River, implying that they may cross the river. Aberdeen ordered the British Fleet to Constantinople and later into the Black Sea.<ref name=EB/> On 23 October 1853, the Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia. A Russian naval raid on Sinope, on 30 November 1853, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish fleet in the [[battle of Sinope]]. When Russia ignored an Anglo-French ultimatum to abandon the Danubian provinces, Britain and France declared war on Russia on 28 March 1854. In September 1854, British and French troops landed on the Crimean peninsula at [[Yevpatoria|Eupatoria]] north of [[Sevastopol]]. The Allied troops then moved across the Alma River on 20 September 1854 at the [[battle of Alma]] and set [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|siege to the fort of Sevastopol]].\n\nA Russian attack on the allied supply base at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]] on 25 October 1854 was rebuffed. The [[Battle of Balaclava]] is noted for its famous (or rather infamous) [[Charge of the Light Brigade]]. On 5 November 1854, Russian forces tried to relieve the siege at Sevastopol and tried to defeat the Allied armies in the field in the [[Battle of Inkerman]]. However, this attempt failed and the Russians were rebuffed. Dissatisfaction as to the course of the war arose in England. As reports returned detailing the mismanagement of the conflict arose Parliament began to investigate. On 29 January 1855, [[John Arthur Roebuck]] introduced a motion for the appointment of a select committee to enquire into the conduct of the war.<ref>Karl Marx, \"Fall of the Aberdeen Ministry\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'' (International Publishers: New York, 1980) p. 631.</ref> This motion was carried by the large majority of 305 in favour and 148 against.\n\n[[File:George-Hamilton-Gordon-4th-Earl-of-Aberdeen (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Aberdeen shortly before his death in 1860]]\nTreating this as a vote of no confidence in his government, Aberdeen resigned, and retired from active politics, speaking for the last time in the House of Lords in 1858.

These pints are divided into two [[cup (unit)|cups]] (though the imperial cup is rarely used now), which in turn are divided into two [[gill (unit)|gills]] (gills are also rarely used). Thus a gallon is equal to four quarts, eight pints, sixteen cups or thirty-two gills. The imperial gill is further divided into five [[fluid ounce]]s, whereas the US gill is divided into four fluid ounces. Thus an imperial fluid ounce is {{sfrac|20}} of an imperial pint or {{sfrac|160}} of an imperial gallon, while a US fluid ounce is {{sfrac|16}} of a US pint or {{sfrac|128}} of a US gallon.\n\nThe imperial gallon, quart, pint, cup and gill are approximately 20% larger than their US counterparts and are therefore not interchangeable. The imperial fluid ounce, on the other hand, is only 4% smaller than the US fluid ounce and therefore they are often used interchangeably.\n\nIn the US, liquor is often sold in \"[[Fifth (unit)|fifth]]s\", which are approximately one-fifth of a US gallon.<ref>E. Frank Henriques, ''The Signet Encyclopedia of Wine'', p. 298</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe term derives most immediately from ''galun, galon'' in [[Old Northern French]], but the usage was common in several languages, for example {{lang|fro|jale}} in [[Old French]] and {{lang|ang|g\u0119llet}} (bowl) in Old English. This suggests a common origin in [[Vulgar Latin|Romance Latin]], but the ultimate source of the word is unknown.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|edition=2|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=gallon, n.}}</ref> The gallon originated as the base of systems for measuring [[English wine cask units|wine]], and [[English brewery cask units|beer]] in England. The sizes of gallon used in these two systems were different from each other: the first was based on the [[wine gallon]] (equal in size to the US gallon), and the second on either the ale gallon or the larger imperial gallon.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, three definitions of the gallon were in common use: {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n*The ''corn gallon'', or ''Winchester gallon'', of about {{nowrap|268.8 cubic inches}} {{nowrap|(\u2248 4.405 L)}},\n*The ''[[wine gallon]]'', or ''[[Queen Anne's gallon]]'', which was {{nowrap|231 cubic inches}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/gallon_english_wine.htm|title=English wine gallon|publisher=}}</ref> {{nowrap|(\u2248 3.79 L)}}, and\n*The ''ale gallon'' of {{nowrap|282 cubic inches}} {{nowrap|(\u2248 4.62 L)}}.\n\nThe ''corn'' or ''[[dry gallon]]'' was used in the United States until recently for grain and other dry commodities. It is one-eighth of the [[bushel|(Winchester) bushel]], originally a cylindrical measure of {{sfrac|18|1|2}} inches in diameter and 8&nbsp;inches in depth. That made the dry gallon {{nowrap|({{sfrac|9|1|4}})<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 [[Pi|\u03c0]] cubic inches \u2248 {{val|268.80252|u=in3}}}}. The bushel, which like dry [[quart]] and pint still sees some use, was later defined to be 2150.42&nbsp;cubic inches exactly, making its gallon exactly {{val|268.8025|u=in3}} ({{val|4.40488377086|u=L}}).\nIn previous centuries, there had been a corn gallon of around 271 to 272 cubic inches.\n\nThe ''[[wine gallon|wine]]'', ''fluid'', or ''liquid gallon'' has been the standard US gallon since the early 19th century. The wine gallon, which some sources relate to the volume occupied by eight medieval [[English unit#Weight|merchant pounds]] of wine, was at one time defined as the volume of a cylinder 6 inches deep and 7 inches in diameter, i.e. {{nowrap|6&nbsp;in \u00d7 ({{sfrac|3|1|2}}&nbsp;in)<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2248 230.907&nbsp;06 cubic inches}}. It had been redefined during the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], in 1706, as 231 cubic inches exactly, which is the result of the earlier definition with \u03c0 approximated to {{sfrac|22|7}}. Although the wine gallon had been used for centuries for import duty purposes there was no legal standard of it in the [[Exchequer]] and a smaller gallon {{nowrap|(224 cu in)}} was actually in use, so this statute became necessary. It remains the US definition today.\n\nIn 1824, Britain adopted a close approximation to the ''ale gallon'' known as the ''imperial gallon'' and abolished all other gallons in favour of it. Inspired by the [[kilogram]]-litre relationship, the imperial gallon was based on the volume of 10 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] of distilled water weighed in air with brass weights with the barometer standing at 30 [[inch of mercury|inches of mercury]] and at a temperature of {{nowrap|62 [[Fahrenheit|\u00b0F]]}}. In 1963, this definition was refined as the space occupied by 10 pounds of distilled water of density {{val|0.998859|u=g/mL}} weighed in air of density {{val|0.001217|u=g/mL}} against weights of density {{nowrap|8.136 g/mL}} (the original \"brass\" was refined as the density of [[brass]] alloys vary depending on metallurgical composition). This works out at approximately {{val|4.5460903|u=L}} ({{val|277.41945|u=in3}}). The metric definition of exactly {{val|4.54609}} cubic decimetres (also {{val|4.54609|u=L}} after the litre was redefined in 1964, \u2248&nbsp;{{val|277.419433|u=in3}}) was adopted shortly afterwards in Canada, but from 1976 the conventional value of {{val|4.546092|u=L}} was used in the United Kingdom until the Canadian convention was adopted in 1985.\n\nHistorically, gallons of various sizes were used in many parts of Western Europe. In these localities, it has been replaced as the unit of capacity by the [[litre]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n!colspan=8|<big>Comparison of historic gallons</big>\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| Volume\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Definition\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Inverted volume<br />(gallons per cubic foot)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Approx.<br />weight of<br />water ([[avoirdupois|pounds]]<br />per gallon<br />@ 62&nbsp;\u00b0F)\n!colspan=\"3\"| Cylindrical approximation\n|-\n!

It was developed by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[statistics|statistician]] and [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Corrado Gini]] and published in his 1912 paper ''Variability and Mutability'' ({{lang-it|Variabilit\u00e0 e mutabilit\u00e0}}).{{sfnp|Gini|1912}}<ref>Gini, C. (1909). \"Concentration and dependency ratios\" (in Italian). English translation in ''Rivista di Politica Economica'', '''87''' (1997), 769\u2013789.</ref>\n\nThe Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a [[frequency distribution]] (for example, levels of [[income]]). A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (for example, where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values (e.g., for a large number of people, where only one person has all the income or consumption, and all others have none, the Gini coefficient will be very nearly one).<ref name=\"US Census Bureau\">{{cite web|title=Current Population Survey (CPS) \u2013 Definitions and Explanations|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cps/cpsdef.html|publisher=US Census Bureau}}</ref><ref>Note: Gini coefficient becomes 1, only in a large population where one person has all the income. In the special case of just two people, where one has no income and the other has all the income, the Gini coefficient is 0.5. For 5 people set, where 4 have no income and the fifth has all the income, the Gini coefficient is 0.8. See: [http://www.fao.org/docs/up/easypol/329/gini_index_040en.pdf FAO, United Nations \u2013 Inequality Analysis, The Gini Index Module] (PDF format), fao.org.</ref> However, a value greater than one may occur if some persons represent negative contribution to the total (for example, having negative income or wealth). For larger groups, values close to or above 1 are very unlikely in practice. Given the normalization of both the cumulative population and the cumulative share of income used to calculate the Gini coefficient, the measure is not overly sensitive to the specifics of the income distribution, but rather only on how incomes vary relative to the other members of a population. The exception to this is in the redistribution of income resulting in a minimum income for all people.  When the population is sorted, if their income distribution were to approximate a well-known function, then some representative values could be calculated.\n\nThe Gini coefficient was proposed by Gini as a measure of [[social inequality|inequality]] of [[income inequality metrics|income]] or [[Wealth concentration|wealth]].<ref>Gini, C.

The line at 45 degrees thus represents perfect equality of incomes. The Gini coefficient can then be thought of as the [[ratio]] of the [[area]] that lies between the line of equality and the [[Lorenz curve]] (marked ''A'' in the diagram) over the total area under the line of equality (marked ''A'' and ''B'' in the diagram); i.e., {{nobreak|G {{=}} ''A'' / (''A'' + ''B'')}}. It is also equal to {{nobreak| 2''A''}} and to {{nobreak| 1 \u2212 2''B''}} due to the fact that {{nobreak|''A'' + ''B'' {{=}} 0.5}} (since the axes scale from 0 to 1).\n\nIf all people have non-negative income (or wealth, as the case may be), the Gini coefficient can theoretically range from 0 (complete equality) to 1 (complete inequality); it is sometimes expressed as a percentage ranging between 0 and 100. In practice, both extreme values are not quite reached. If negative values are possible (such as the negative wealth of people with debts), then the Gini coefficient could theoretically be more than 1. Normally the mean (or total) is assumed positive, which rules out a Gini coefficient less than zero.\n\nAn alternative approach is to define the Gini coefficient as half of the [[relative mean absolute difference]], which is mathematically equivalent to the Lorenz curve definition.<ref>{{citation | last = Sen | first = Amartya | authorlink = Amartya Sen | title = On Economic Inequality | publisher = Oxford University Press | place = Oxford | edition = 2nd | year = 1977}}</ref>\nThe mean absolute difference is the average [[absolute difference]] of all pairs of items of the population, and the relative mean absolute difference is the mean absolute difference divided by the average, to normalize for scale. If ''x<sub>i</sub>'' is the wealth or income of person ''i'', and there are ''n'' persons, then the Gini coefficient ''G'' is given by:\n\n:<math>\nG = \\frac{\\displaystyle{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left| x_i - x_j \\right|}}{\\displaystyle{2 \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n x_j}} = \\frac{\\displaystyle{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left| x_i - x_j \\right|}}{\\displaystyle{2n\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}} \n</math>\n\nWhen the income (or wealth) distribution is given as a continuous [[probability distribution function]] ''p(x)'', where ''p(x)dx'' is the fraction of the population with income ''x'' to ''x+dx'', then the Gini coefficient is again half of the relative mean absolute difference:\n\n:<math>\nG = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(x)p(y)\\,|x-y|\\,dx\\,dy\n</math>\n\nwhere \u03bc is the mean of the distribution <math>\\mu=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x \\,p(x) \\,dx</math> and the lower limits of integration may be replaced by zero when all incomes are positive.\n\n== Calculation ==\n\n=== Example: two levels of income ===\n[[File:Gini coefficient for distribution with only two income or wealth levels.svg|thumb|Richest ''u'' % of population (red) equally share ''f'' % of all income or wealth, others (green) equally share remainder: {{nowrap|''G'' {{=}} ''f'' \u2212 ''u''}}.

If the high income group is ''u'' % of the population and earns a fraction ''f'' % of all income, then the Gini coefficient is {{nowrap|''f'' \u2212 ''u''}}. An actual more graded distribution with these same values ''u'' and ''f'' will always have a higher Gini coefficient than {{nowrap|''f'' \u2212 ''u''}}.\n\nThe proverbial case where the richest 20% have 80% of all income (see [[Pareto principle]]) would lead to an income Gini coefficient of at least 60%.\n\nAn often cited<ref>{{cite web|title=Half of world's wealth now in hands of 1% of population|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/13/half-world-wealth-in-hands-population-inequality-report|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> case that 1% of all the world's population owns 50% of all wealth, means a wealth Gini coefficient of at least 49%.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Alternate expressions ===\n\nIn some cases, this equation can be applied to calculate the Gini coefficient without direct reference to the Lorenz curve. For example, (taking ''y'' to mean the income or wealth of a person or household):\n* For a population uniform on the values ''y''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i'' = 1 to ''n'', indexed in non-decreasing order (''y''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2264 ''y''<sub>''i''+1</sub>):\n:<math>G = \\frac{1}{n}\\left ( n+1 - 2 \\left ( \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\; (n+1-i)y_i}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n y_i} \\right ) \\right ) </math>\n:This may be simplified to:\n:<math>G = \\frac{2 \\Sigma_{i=1}^n \\; i y_i}{n \\Sigma_{i=1}^n y_i} -\\frac{n+1}{n}</math>\n:This formula actually applies to any real population, since each person can be assigned his or her own ''y''<sub>''i''</sub>.<ref name=\"Wolfram Mathworld\">{{cite web|title=Gini Coefficient|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GiniCoefficient.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld}}</ref>\n\nSince the Gini coefficient is half the relative mean absolute difference, it can also be calculated using formulas for the relative mean absolute difference. For a random sample ''S'' consisting of values ''y''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i'' = 1 to ''n'', that are indexed in non-decreasing order (''y''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2264 ''y''<sub>''i''+1</sub>), the statistic:\n:<math>G(S) = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\left (n+1 - 2 \\left ( \\frac{\\Sigma_{i=1}^n \\; (n+1-i)y_i}{\\Sigma_{i=1}^n y_i}\\right ) \\right )</math>\n\n:is a [[consistent estimator]] of the population Gini coefficient, but is not, in general, [[estimator#Point estimators|unbiased]].

These formulae are also applicable in the limit as <math>n\\rightarrow\\infty</math>.\n\n=== Continuous probability distribution ===\n\nWhen the population is large, the income distribution may be represented by a continuous [[probability density function]] ''f(x)'' where ''f(x) dx'' is the fraction of the population with wealth or income in the interval ''dx'' about ''x''.  If ''F(x)'' is the [[cumulative distribution function]] for ''f(x)'', then the Lorenz curve ''L(F)'' may then be represented as a function parametric in ''L(x)'' and ''F(x)'' and the value of ''B'' can be found by [[integral|integration]]:\n\n:<math>B = \\int_0^1 L(F) dF. </math>\n\nThe Gini coefficient can also be calculated directly from the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the distribution ''F''(''y''). Defining \u03bc as the mean of the distribution, and specifying that  ''F''(''y'') is zero for all negative values, the Gini coefficient is given by:\n:<math>G = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\int_0^\\infty (1-F(y))^2dy = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\int_0^\\infty F(y)(1-F(y))dy</math>\nThe latter result comes from [[integration by parts]]. (Note that this formula can be applied when there are negative values if the integration is taken from minus infinity to plus infinity.)\n\nThe Gini coefficient may be expressed in terms of the [[quantile function]] ''Q''(''F'') (inverse of the cumulative distribution function: Q(F(x))=x)\n: <math>G=\\frac{1}{2 \\mu}\\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 |Q(F_1)-Q(F_2)|\\,dF_1\\,dF_2 .</math>\n\nFor some functional forms, the Gini index can be calculated explicitly. For example, if ''y'' follows a [[lognormal distribution]] with the standard deviation of logs equal to <math>\\sigma</math>, then <math>G = \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma }{2 }\\right)</math> where <math>\\operatorname{erf}</math> is the [[error function]] ( since <math> G=2 \\phi \\left(\\frac{\\sigma }{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)-1</math>, where  <math>\\phi</math> is the cumulative standard normal distribution).<ref>Crow, E.

More accurate results can be obtained using other methods to [[Numerical integration|approximate the area]] B, such as approximating the Lorenz curve with a [[Simpson's rule|quadratic function]] across pairs of intervals, or building an appropriately smooth approximation to the underlying distribution function that matches the known data. If the population mean and boundary values for each interval are also known, these can also often be used to improve the accuracy of the approximation.\n\nThe Gini coefficient calculated from a sample is a statistic and its standard error, or confidence intervals for the population Gini coefficient, should be reported. These can be calculated using [[Resampling (statistics)#Bootstrap|bootstrap]] techniques but those proposed have been mathematically complicated and computationally onerous even in an era of fast computers. Ogwang (2000) made the process more efficient by setting up a \"trick regression model\" in which respective income variables in the sample are ranked with the lowest income being allocated rank 1. The model then expresses the rank (dependent variable) as the sum of a constant ''A'' and a [[normal distribution|normal]] error term whose variance is inversely proportional to ''y''<sub>''k''</sub>;\n\n:<math>k = A + \\ N(0, s^{2}/y_k) </math>\n\nOgwang showed that ''G'' can be expressed as a function of the weighted least squares estimate of the constant ''A'' and that this can be used to speed up the calculation of the [[Resampling (statistics)#Jackknife|jackknife]] estimate for the standard error. Giles (2004) argued that the standard error of the estimate of ''A'' can be used to derive that of the estimate of ''G'' directly without using a jackknife at all. This method only requires the use of ordinary least squares regression after ordering the sample data. The results compare favorably with the estimates from the jackknife with agreement improving with increasing sample size.{{sfnp|Giles|2004}}\n\nHowever it has since been argued that this is dependent on the model's assumptions about the error distributions (Ogwang 2004) and the independence of error terms (Reza & Gastwirth 2006) and that these assumptions are often not valid for real data sets. It may therefore be better to stick with jackknife methods such as those proposed by [[Shlomo Yitzhaki (economics)|Yitzhaki]] (1991) and Karagiannis and Kovacevic (2000). The debate continues.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nGuillermina Jasso<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jasso|first=Guillermina|year=1979|title=On Gini's Mean Difference and Gini's Index of Concentration|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=44|issue=5|pages=867\u2013870|jstor=2094535|doi=10.2307/2094535}}</ref> and [[Angus Deaton]]{{sfnp|Deaton|1997|p=139}} independently proposed the following formula for the Gini coefficient:\n\n:<math>G = \\frac{N+1}{N-1}-\\frac{2}{N(N-1)\\mu}(\\Sigma_{i=1}^n \\; P_iX_i)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is mean income of the population, P<sub>i</sub> is the income rank P of person i, with income X, such that the richest person receives a rank of 1 and the poorest a rank of N.

By ignoring wealth (except as it contributes to income) the Gini can create the appearance of inequality when the people compared are at different stages in their life.

For example, five 20% quantiles (low granularity) will usually yield a lower Gini coefficient than twenty 5% quantiles (high granularity) for the same distribution. Philippe Monfort has shown that using inconsistent or unspecified granularity limits the usefulness of Gini coefficient measurements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Convergence of EU regions: Measures and evolution|first=Philippe|last=Monfort|publisher=European Union \u2013 Europa|page=6|year=2008|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/work/200801_convergence.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe Gini coefficient measure gives different results when applied to individuals instead of households, for the same economy and same income distributions. If household data is used, the measured value of income Gini depends on how the household is defined. When different populations are not measured with consistent definitions, comparison is not meaningful.\n\nDeininger and Squire (1996) show that income Gini coefficient based on individual income, rather than household income, are different. For example, for the United States, they find that the individual income-based Gini index was 0.35, while for France it was 0.43. According to their individual focused method, in the 108 countries they studied, South Africa had the world's highest Gini coefficient at 0.62, Malaysia had Asia's highest Gini coefficient at 0.5, Brazil the highest at 0.57 in Latin America and Caribbean region, and Turkey the highest at 0.5 in OECD countries.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A New Data Set Measuring Income Inequality|first1=Klaus|last1=Deininger |first2=Lyn|last2=Squire |journal=World Bank Economic Review|year=1996|volume= 10|pages= 565\u2013591|doi= 10.1093/wber/10.3.565|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1996/09/01/000009265_3961214153426/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|issue=3}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float: left; margin-right:1em;\"\n|+ Table C.

Typically, increases in the proportion of young or old members of a society will drive apparent changes in equality, simply because people generally have lower incomes and wealth when they are young than when they are old. Because of this, factors such as age distribution within a population and mobility within income classes can create the appearance of inequality when none exist taking into account demographic effects. Thus a given economy may have a higher Gini coefficient at any one point in time compared to another, while the Gini coefficient calculated over individuals' lifetime income is actually lower than the apparently more equal (at a given point in time) economy's.<ref name=blomq81>{{Cite journal |first=N. |last=Blomquist |year=1981 |title=A comparison of distributions of annual and lifetime income: Sweden around 1970 |journal=Review of Income and Wealth |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=243\u2013264 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4991.1981.tb00227.x}}</ref> Essentially, what matters is not just inequality in any particular year, but the composition of the distribution over time.\n\nKwok claims income Gini coefficient for Hong Kong has been high (0.434 in 2010<ref name=undp2010a />), in part because of structural changes in its population. Over recent decades, Hong Kong has witnessed increasing numbers of small households, elderly households and elderly living alone. The combined income is now split into more households. Many old people are living separately from their children in Hong Kong. These social changes have caused substantial changes in household income distribution. Income Gini coefficient, claims Kwok, does not discern these structural changes in its society.<ref name=Kwok10 /> Household money income distribution for the United States, summarized in Table C of this section, confirms that this issue is not limited to just Hong Kong. According to the US Census Bureau, between 1979 and 2010, the population of United States experienced structural changes in overall households, the income for all income brackets increased in inflation-adjusted terms, household income distributions shifted into higher income brackets over time, while the income Gini coefficient increased.<ref name=uscb2011 /><ref name=cbo.p.10>[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12485 Congressional Budget Office: Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007]. October 2011. see pp. i\u2013x, with definitions on ii\u2013iii</ref>\n\nAnother limitation of Gini coefficient is that it is not a proper measure of [[egalitarianism]], as it is only measures income dispersion. For example, if two equally egalitarian countries pursue different immigration policies, the country accepting a higher proportion of low-income or impoverished migrants will report a higher Gini coefficient and therefore may appear to exhibit more income inequality.\n\n;Inability to value benefits and income from [[Informal sector|informal economy]] affects Gini coefficient accuracy\nSome countries distribute benefits that are difficult to value. Countries that provide subsidized housing, medical care, education or other such services are difficult to value objectively, as it depends on quality and extent of the benefit. In absence of free markets, valuing these income transfers as household income is subjective. The theoretical model of Gini coefficient is limited to accepting correct or incorrect subjective assumptions.\n\nIn subsistence-driven and informal economies, people may have significant income in other forms than money, for example through [[subsistence farming]] or [[barter]]ing. These income tend to accrue to the segment of population that is below-poverty line or very poor, in emerging and transitional economy countries such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe. Informal economy accounts for over half of global employment and as much as 90 per cent of employment in some of the poorer sub-Saharan countries with high official Gini inequality coefficients.

It is not additive and different sets of people cannot be averaged to obtain the Gini coefficient of all the people in the sets.\n\n== Alternatives to Gini coefficient ==\nGiven the limitations of Gini coefficient, other statistical methods are used in combination or as an alternative measure of population dispersity. For example, ''entropy measures'' are frequently used (e.g. the [[Atkinson index]] or the [[Theil Index]] and [[Mean log deviation]] as special cases of the [[generalized entropy index]]). These measures attempt to compare the distribution of resources by intelligent agents in the market with a maximum [[information entropy|entropy]] [[random distribution]], which would occur if these agents acted like non-intelligent particles in a closed system following the laws of statistical physics.\n\n== Relation to other statistical measures ==\nThe Gini coefficient is sometimes alternatively ''defined'' as twice the area between the [[receiver operating characteristic]] (ROC) curve and its diagonal, in which case the [[Receiver operating characteristic#Area under curve|AUC]] ([[Integral|Area Under]] the ROC Curve) measure of performance is given by <math>AUC = (G+1)/2</math>.<ref name=hand>{{cite journal|last=Hand|first=David J.|first2=Robert J.|last2=Till|title=A Simple Generalisation of the Area Under the ROC Curve for Multiple Class Classification Problems|journal=Machine Learning|year=2001|volume=45|issue=2|pages=171\u2013186|doi=10.1023/A:1010920819831|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1010920819831.pdf}}</ref>   The Gini coefficient is also closely related to [[Mann\u2013Whitney U]].\n\nThe Gini index is also related to Pietra index\u2014both of which are a measure of statistical heterogeneity and are derived from Lorenz curve and the diagonal line.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Iddo I.|last1=Eliazar |first2=Igor M.|last2=Sokolov |year=2010 |title=Measuring statistical heterogeneity: The Pietra index|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|volume=389|issue= 1|pages= 117\u2013125|doi= 10.1016/j.physa.2009.08.006|bibcode=2010PhyA..389..117E}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Probabilistic Analysis of Global Performances of Diagnostic Tests: Interpreting the Lorenz Curve-Based Summary Measures|first=Wen-Chung|last=Lee|journal=Statistics in Medicine|volume= 18|pages= 455\u2013471|year= 1999|url= http://ntur.lib.ntu.edu.tw/bitstream/246246/160620/1/37.pdf|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19990228)18:4<455::AID-SIM44>3.0.CO;2-A|pmid=10070686|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nIn certain fields such as ecology, inverse Simpson's index <math>1/\\lambda</math> is used to quantify diversity, and this should not be confused with the [[Diversity index#Simpson index|Simpson index]] <math>\\lambda</math>.

It was held that executive action is not immune from judicial review simply because it uses powers derived from common law rather than statute (thus the prerogative is reviewable).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1983/9.html|title= UKHL 9|publisher=United Kingdom House of Lords Decisions|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\n{{Main article|Director of the Government Communications Headquarters}}\nThe following is a list of the heads of the operational heads of GCHQ and GC&CS:\n\n*[[Alastair Denniston]] <small>[[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]]</small> (1921 \u2013 February 1942) (continued as Deputy Director (Diplomatic and Commercial) until 1945).\n*Sir [[Edward Travis]] <small>[[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] CBE</small> (February 1942 \u2013 1952)\n*Sir [[Eric Malcolm Jones|Eric Jones]] <small>KCMG [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]] [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]]</small> (April 1952 \u2013 1960)\n*Sir [[Clive Loehnis]] <small>KCMG</small> (1960\u20131964)\n*Sir [[Leonard James Hooper|Leonard Hooper]] <small>KCMG CBE</small> (1965\u20131973)\n*Sir [[Arthur Bonsall]] <small>KCMG CBE </small> (1973\u20131978)\n*Sir [[Brian Tovey|Brian John Maynard Tovey]] <small>KCMG</small> (1978\u20131983)\n*Sir [[Peter Marychurch]] <small>KCMG</small> (1983\u20131989)\n*Sir [[John Adye|John Anthony Adye]] <small>KCMG</small> (1989\u20131996)\n*Sir [[David Omand]] <small>[[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath|GCB]]</small> (1996 \u20131997)\n*Sir [[Kevin Tebbit]] <small>[[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|KCB]] CMG</small> (1998)\n*Sir [[Francis Richards (diplomat)|Francis Richards]] <small>KCMG [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]]</small> (1998\u20132003)\n*Sir [[David Pepper (intelligence official)|David Pepper]] <small>KCMG</small> (2003\u20132008)\n*Sir [[Iain Lobban]] <small>KCMG CB</small> (2008\u20132014)\n*[[Robert Hannigan]] <small>CMG</small> (2014\u20132017)\n*[[Jeremy Fleming]] (2017\u2013present)\n\n==Stations and former stations==\nThe following are the stations and former stations that continued to operate through the [[Cold War]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jCbW82ABTkC&pg=PA8 |title=How Cheltenham entered America's backyard|work=New Scientist|date=5 April 1984|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref>\n* Stations\n** [[Cat Hill, Ascension Island|GCHQ Ascension Island]]\n** [[GCHQ Bude]]\n** [[Ayios Nikolaos Station|GCHQ Cyprus]]\n** [[GCHQ Scarborough]]\n* Former stations\n** [[Brora Y Station|GCHQ Brora]]\n** [[Woodhead Hall|GCHQ Cheadle]]\n** [[RAF Culmhead|GCHQ Culmhead]]\n** [[Hawklaw Y Station|GCHQ Hawklaw]]\n** [[RAF Little Sai Wan|GCHQ Hong Kong]]\n\n==GCHQ Certified Training==\nThe GCHQ Certified Training (GCT) scheme was established to certify two main levels of cyber security training.  There are also degree and masters level courses. These are:\n\n* Awareness Level Training: giving an understanding and a foundation in cyber security concepts; and\n* Application Level Training: a more in-depth course\n\nThe GCT scheme was designed to help organisations find the right training that also met GCHQ's exacting standards.  It was designed to assure high quality cyber security training courses where the training provider had also undergone rigorous quality checks.  The GCT process is carried out by APMG as the independent certification body. The scheme is part of the National Cyber Security Programme established by the Government to develop knowledge, skills and capability in all aspects of cyber security in the, and is based on the IISP

Polish monarchs]] was not really the good place to try and sort out ''guidelines''. --[[User:Francis Schonken|Francis Schonken]] 16:30, 29 January 2006 (UTC)\n-->\n\nThere has been an attempt to create a naming system specifically for Polish monarchs (but it is just a proposal and never received consensus), against the system used for other European monarchs. There is also the fact that most Polish monarchs now are located in places which contravene to general naming convention. There is no consensus for permission to use an exception for Polish monarchs, and such permission should be sought from consensus at [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (names and titles)]] where there is the thread [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (names and titles)#Need of particular exception/ convention for Polish monarchs]]. At that spot there are editors who are more or less experienced in overall picture of monarch naming and not only one country. It is deception to advertise any system for naming before a consensus there is convinced of the need for such exception. I hope all of you continue the naming scheme discussion for Polish monarchs there, before continuing or creating policy forks. [[User:Shilkanni|Shilkanni]] 13:06, 6 June 2006 (UTC)\n* '''agree''' with this analysis of current state of affairs, which means: relay this to [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (names and titles)]]. And which also means that until further notice current separate NC proposals for Polish rulers are rejected. --[[User:Francis Schonken|Francis Schonken]] 13:42, 6 June 2006 (UTC)\n* '''agree''' with Shilkanni, and the rejection of this proposal.  There have been too many forked discussions about this matter, especially in nooks and crannies of Wikipedia that do not have the attention they need to garner a genuine cross-cultural community consensus.  Moving all of the discussions to one centralized location at [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (names and titles)#Need of particular exception/ convention for Polish monarchs]] is an excellent idea. --[[User:Elonka|Elonka]] 18:19, 6 June 2006 (UTC)\n* '''agree''' also. It is sad that this little coup was allowed to take place without anyone but its two perpetrators being informed. Despite all his attempts to convince, Piotrus has given no reason other than his own patriotism as to why these monarchs should be different from those of other European monarchies. - '''[[User:Calgacus|Calgacus]] (''[[User talk:Calgacus|\u039a\u0391\u039b\u0393\u0391\u039a\u039f\u03a3]]'')''' 19:12, 6 June 2006 (UTC)\n\n<!--\n----\n{{Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Polish rulers)/table}}\n\n==Note: fictional rulers of Poland==\n*'''Le Roi Venceslas''', '''P\u00e8re Ubu''' and '''Bougrelas''' in ''[[Ubu Roi ou les Polonais]]'' (note: several other royals, including [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski|Stanislas Leczinski]] and [[Jan III Sobieski|Jean Sobieski]] also figure in this spoofical play)\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Polish rulers]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)]]\n\n<nowiki>[[Category:Wikipedia naming conventions|Polish rulers, guidelines for the spelling of names]]</nowiki>\n-->\n\n[[Category:Wikipedia naming conventions proposals|Polish rulers, guidelines for the spelling of names]]", "sha1": "6r7ew5e5bb62062u7zr9uj55nzrgd9t"}}]
